hey everybody come on in come on in it's
time
for coffee with scott adams the best
place to be
at the best time in the entire world
yeah a lot of people think there are
better places to be
they're not really this is the best
place to be
and every one of you know it because
you're here you could be anywhere
well you could be watching anything but
no
you're here because you know that you
can have the best time
of your entire day and all you need is a
couple of bubble glass tank or jealous
times canteen jungle flash vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day thing that makes
everything better except apparently that
big ship that's stuck in the zoo as
canal
but let's see if we can get that out
yeah
i think the simultaneous sip has the
power to dislodge
shipping vessels from canals go
i feel they're wiggling right now yep oh
hold on
i feel it coming loose it's coming loose
well let's talk about all the stories
yes let's talk about that big old ship
so the name of the ship
humorously is the evergreen
isn't that kind of perfect because the
story became an evergreen
and evergreen is like it never goes away
every day you wake up and
still a ship stuck in the suez canal and
you're not going to be able to wipe your
ass if it stays there much longer
uh so if so this morning
the news was that it yeah at least one
part of it got free
and everybody's thinking yay if one part
of it is free
it's not going to take long to get the
other part free is it
except they let the wind blow it back
into
its stuck position and i ask you this
is the wind around the suez canal
sort of a special kind of wind is it the
kind of wind that targets
specific ships because it seems to me
that
a suez canal that is filled with
shipping
uh ships shipping that's why they call
them ships
they probably figured out the whole wind
thing by now
right but yet i'm not hearing that the
wind has disrupted his shipping all over
the world
seems to be just this little evergreen
ship gets a little extra wind
i feel and that's not right
so i won't make any other jokes uh had
some good ones but they're not for the
public
um but that ship is not quite out yet
the wind blew it back
back into a stuck position and i do love
i do love the simplicity of the story as
somebody said on twitter
all of our other stories are too
complicated they have lots of variables
but this one's great you can sum it up
easily
ship stuck needed unstuck
that's it all right uh trump made news
again
a couple ways uh he attended i guess he
crashed a wedding at mar-a-lago
and there's a video of him uh sort of
talking about himself and talking about
uh
the government and it wasn't until the
very end that he says something to the
bride and groom
you could tell he got a big applause it
was it was a friendly trump crowd
as you might imagine they had a wedding
at mar-a-lago they were probably
pro-trump
and uh but the way it's being portrayed
out of context
is that he was rude and boorish and
crashed a wedding and talked about
himself and forgot about the bridegroom
and then left
[Laughter]
nothing like that happened exactly the
opposite
he showed up at a wedding thrilled the
the wedding people
they had the wedding of of all time the
most memorable wedding you could
possibly have
because trump showed up and gave a
speech unexpectedly
all right so the bride and groom
probably had like the best story ever
but it yeah exactly it got rhubarb so
that story got totally rhubarb
if you cut off the last part it looks
like he never even addressed
the uh the uh bride and groom
all right uh trump is also saying he's
gonna visit the border
this is why he was the fun president
visiting the border is just the best
thing you could possibly do
when the sitting president is not
visiting the border during
a crisis so if the ex-president visits
the border before the sitting president
sort of makes the sitting president look
not so strong on that issue if you know
what i mean
so that's a good play by trump
persuasion wise
good play so
um the george floyd trial is starting
today i guess and have you noticed how
one story ends and then there's always
another one that just backfills it
perfectly
why isn't there ever a day i guess there
were a few without trump
in the winter in which it seemed like
there wasn't much news but it's kind of
weird how the news always has a big
story
in the pipeline the the timing of it is
a little suspicious
you know sometimes there are two at a
time but they really make sure that
pipeline is filled
which sort of suggests to me that if we
had a time when there wasn't much
happening
that the news would make something out
of nothing
huh they wouldn't do that would they
make something out of nothing just to
make news maybe they would and how would
we know
how would we know if there was a real
issue and we were just reading the news
and seeing a real issue
or the news business had created an
issue
that otherwise you wouldn't have even
cared about or known about or had any
impact
you know whatever so you start to see
the the pattern that the news is pretty
much
artificial at least in terms of how you
feel about it
so the things you feel about the
strongest
aren't necessarily the important things
that happen so the news no longer
reports what's important
per se they report what's going to get
the best audience
well in there's a publication called
real clear investigations
they're reporting about uh this little
county in montana
missoula only a hundred and twenty
thousand people in the whole
whole area and uh they did
a a full audit of the mail in ballots
now apparently other audits have been
sample
audits i wasn't aware of that so when
larger places are audited
they can't count them all because there
would be too many so they pick a sample
and just count those
now i have questions
did you know that first of all that the
other mail-in ballot audits
were samples and not actually just
counting all the ballots
i didn't know that so that's interesting
but here's my second question
what do we know about how they picked
the sample
who exactly gave them the sample
did the auditors go into a big room
you know full of ballots and say all
right we're just going to randomly you
know
and how would you do it how would you
randomly
select ballots because even if you went
and said i'll just randomly pick the man
of this pile in this pile
probably it wouldn't be random would it
because that's not even close to random
right i mean mathematically
statistically
even if you weren't trying to take them
from the same place
you couldn't guarantee it was random it
wouldn't be possible
so i ask you this question were the
people who
audited the ballots the same ones who
decided
which ones to audit in other words did
they do the randomness
or i'm just going to put that out there
because i don't know the answer
and let me let me tell you that
no core has found any widespread fraud
no court has a as a ruling of any
widespread fraud
in the election right it's a it's a big
lie
it's a big lie i'm saying that so i can
stay on social media
now on with the story so the question is
do the people who have done sample
representative audits of
big places were was the sample
given to them by the same people who
organized the election
or did they somehow get to pick it and
if they picked it
how in the world did they know it was
representative
and do you want a representative sample
because i don't think you want a
representative sample do you
don't you want you don't you assume that
if there's
a problem it's probably not going to be
evenly spread
so wouldn't a representative sample of
ballots
eliminate the possibility of finding
fraud
because you could find some but you say
it's hardly anything
this this one sample that we got from
this one
town he had a problem but it's just one
but it's also the only one you checked
in that town because it was a
representative sample
so if you do a representative sample
doesn't that
guarantee or almost guarantee just
math-wise and statistically that you
wouldn't find any fraud
am i wrong about that
it sort of calls into question whether
any audits have been done at all
in any way that would matter so i'll
just
put it as a question it's not an
accusation
because that would get me kicked off of
social media so i have no reason to
believe that any audits were
insufficient
i simply have a gap in my understanding
of how they could possibly pick iran you
know
some representative sample that actually
meant something
but anyway back to this little missoula
place
so they did an audit in which because it
was a smaller place
and there were volunteers and they got
approval to do it
they could look at every single one so i
believe this might be the only place
that every ballot was checked maybe you
know
fact check me on that and here's what
they found
uh there were enough irregularities that
could have changed the election
like easily that there were so many
in a place where elections were often
close
that it was way beyond the point
let me see i'm seeing some answers about
the samples
um see uh okay i don't see an answer i
want to read
but some people are addressing the
sample size question
so again i i put that out there as a
question not an accusation
i don't know how it could be
representative but maybe it is
um so what they found is that out of uh
72 000 million votes 4 600 of them
were without envelopes
six point three percent of all votes
of the mail-in votes not of all votes
but six percent of the mail-in votes
didn't have envelopes
which means that legally they should not
have been counted
but they were
um and what's more
according to this is from the article
according to auditors county employees
claimed that during the post-election
audit
some of the envelopes may have been
double counted
so might even be a higher number of
missing envelopes but they don't know
that for sure
and and apparently there were some
postmark
issues as well so
fact check me on this will you just fact
check me number one
is the story even true all right like
i don't trust anything like maybe this
story didn't even happen
maybe there's no place called missoula
right i mean
anything's possible in 2021. so first of
all is the story even true
i don't know i don't know i don't even
know how to know
but if it were true is it the only place
they've ever checked
and it's also completely
problematic i hate using that word i'm
gonna
i'm gonna erase that word and back up
like i never used it before
um the only place you checked
there was a problem is that true
so there is a missoula in montana at
least that's
well that part i was pretty confident
about but uh
was there really an election somebody
says yeah you know
i gotta say i gotta say this certainly
raises some questions
but like i said the courts have shown no
proof
of widespread fraud uh jack bosovic had
the
a great prank tweet this morning
and uh here's the setup as you know
there are a bunch of anti-fog people who
are counter-protesting
some i guess
some republican types some conservative
types who were protesting something
anyways the antifa people were throwing
rocks through the cars of anything that
had a flag on it
or the trucks usually and so there was
some
some of that kind of violence and
destruction
and uh and jack
tweeted tongue-in-cheek armed antifa
antifa insurrectionists attempted to
overthrow the oregon state capitol today
now of course that's a joke on the
capital riots where anything that looks
like a protest
you know could be construed by the fake
media as a
as an insurrection mike baker
corresponded to the new york times
not understanding that this was a joke
tweets about it the tweet below is
getting a lot of traction
but is it even close to being true yeah
which is
often the case with jokes they're not
that close to being true
um the crowd of anti-fascist
activists gathering in front of the
capital to protest
a planned right-wing event there was no
attempted overthrow
yes there was no attempted overthrow
good to know so we have that
clarification of a prank
um breaking news i don't know if he knew
this but 25 percent of people polled on
any topic our idiots
have you ever noticed that it doesn't
matter what the question is
if it's on politics anyway any question
on politics
25 of the country is going to be on the
dumb side
it doesn't even matter what the question
is and i and i wonder
is it the same people every time
or is it just always a coincidence that
about 25
of the people will disagree on things
no matter what they are or is it always
the 20 same 25 percent who just don't
understand anything
makes you wonder i imagine it's
different people but
it's a funny question so here's in case
in point
rasmussen is uh reporting about the
support for voter id laws
so apparently back in 2018 so not that
long ago
the support for voter id laws among
white
people was 67 to 74
among blacks it was 55 to 69
and other non-whites uh well that's
interesting it's much higher 76 to 82.
uh and so among all voters
the range was 67 to 75
but the current average is 75.
so in other words the support for voter
id laws has
climbed substantially a lot more people
are in favor of it
but i go back to my question 25
of the country is not in favor of
knowing who voted
what's wrong with them what's wrong with
them
so um so i
see somebody saying that scott believes
polls again uh well i'm reading the
rasmussen polls
the rasmussen polls at least on the
presidential stuff that i follow
i don't know about anything else but on
the presidential stuff they've been one
of the closest
pollsters consistently
so following a pollster that is
consistently
one of the best is not exactly
being too stupid following the polls
that come out prior to an election which
you know
are fake polls would be sort of dumb
all right so you can't say polls or
polls some of them are just obviously
fake all the time
now as i've been telling you lately i've
decided to self-identify as black
and i decided i haven't explained that
well enough because some people still
think it's a joke
but it's not number one
i agree literally no joke
being completely serious i agree with
the concept that people can
self-identify
let me give you an example let's say
somebody is
technically bisexual at least
in their own mind they they would
consider themselves bisexual
but let's say they just have more of an
affinity for the gay lifestyle
spend more time there have more gay
friends than stray friends
and just decide to identify as gay
but maybe technically in their mind they
know that they could go the other way if
they wanted to
so should they be allowed to identify as
gay when sort of technically maybe
they're not so much
completely gay as bi but they have an
affinity for that lifestyle
i say yes i say yes because they would
certainly be treated as gay
they would be living the life you know
etc so i say yes
likewise as you know i've been
pro-transgender
everything and should those folks be
allowed to
live the life and identify with the
group that they want
because of an affinity for it
technically
if you looked at their dna right you'd
say well technically
this isn't the the group that we would
have put you in but if you have an
affinity for that group it's where you
it's where you feel you live and belong
and how you're going to be treated in
life i'm okay with that
i feel that's a reasonable a reasonable
thing
and so based on that same standard which
i've accepted as reasonable
and likewise i accept that if somebody
is a
25 you know genetically
black that if they identify as just
black
we accept that right because same reason
you know their their lifestyle
their their interests the way they're
treated might be more in one group so
yeah
identify that way even if technically
somebody else might argue you shouldn't
be
so here's why i've decided to
self-identify as black number one i like
to be on a winning team
i like to be in the winning team who's
winning
well i would say black americans are
starting to finally
like really getting a getting a little
bit of purchase right
finally after you know hundreds of years
it does look like
the you know black situation is doing
pretty well
largely because of activism
whereas the white situation is sort of
decreasing
wouldn't you say now i'm not i'm not
putting a value judgment on that i'm
just saying if you observe it it looks
like that
so i like being on the winning team
number two
i'm told by science that all of us have
african roots now if it's truly we all
have african roots
if you look at the full arc of human
evolution
most of the time i've been african in
other words my
my family ancestry probably spent more
time
african than they did in europe so
i say i say genetically i've got an
argument there
i've also lost two careers for my race
i've told you that too many times i lost
my banking career because i was white
and was told that directly by the way
i'm not i'm not
reading between the lines boss told me
that i lost my telecom career because i
was white again my boss told me directly
you're white we can't promote you and i
would say that my current career
as a you know cartoonist and now public
commentator
i probably lost i'd say a third
to a half of my potential income to race
because if i talked about trump in any
positive way
that made me look like a white
supremacist people don't buy my books
et cetera so i've lost two two careers
completely
because of my race and my current one is
probably down by a third or so
because of my race now you tell me who
do
i have more affinity with people who are
uh who are discriminated against for
race
or people who are not i have
i have way more affinity with people who
have been discriminated against
for race and by the way that's not a
joke
that's literally true i do have more
affinity for anybody discriminated
against by race
that's how it works if something happens
to you that happened to somebody else
you
you have some appreciation for it that's
how it works
and then um and i've also done more work
for to benefit the black community than
any other so i would say that's my
affinity group and that's what i choose
all right here's a little issue that i
saw in a cartoon
but it's actually a pretty good point
we're making a big deal and
should about asian american violence
because we don't want
any of that we don't want any of that
bias and discrimination in our country
so we started out with black lives
matter
you know my group but now we're we're
sort of talking about
asian americans being discriminated and
we're very close
very close to saying asian american
lives matter
we're going to get to the point where
they all matter except for
these white supremacist lives
so it'll be interesting to see how the
asian-american thing
has an influence on the black lives
matter thing or if they just always live
separately
but it seems like one would influence
the other
i told you that the news is all
artificial
and what you consider the biggest story
is often completely irrelevant
and what you consider no story at all is
often the biggest thing happening
here's a good example i would argue
that the biggest thing that's going to
come out of the coronavirus thing
is the death of public schools because
the teachers unions have overreached
right the teachers unions have
overreached
and if you're not following uh
let's see you should be following corey
d'angelos on twitter because uh he
he's sort of the only one who seems to
be consistently reporting on the all the
changes that are happening but today
we're hearing that west virginia
governor
jim justice just signed this year's most
expensive bill
to fund students instead of systems now
that's happening all over the place
a bunch of different states especially
where they have republican control
are giving us deciding that the funding
will follow the student
so the student can go to whatever school
they want private or public
and it won't just go to the school
instead
i think the teachers unions have
destroyed public
education as a monopoly
it looks like they overreached and
destroyed it now
as you know the teachers unions are the
biggest
source of systemic racism
and i don't think enough of my people
are talking about this but
it's the biggest source and it might be
on the way to self-solving
in other words the pandemic may have
solved the biggest form
of systemic racism in the country i
don't think there's a bigger
story than that i i
propose to you that this is the biggest
story in the country
and it's basically you know one guy
who's tweeting about it it's the biggest
story
like this is the one that moves the
planet this one moves
civilization the entire future of the
united states
compared to let's say our competition
with china
is really really dependent on this
biggest story in the country completely
ignored
it's not even you won't find it on any
website
you'd have to follow somebody on twitter
to even know it's happening
also from rasmussen 76 percent of
folks say that gun gun ownership is a
constitutional right
76 percent say gun ownership is a
constitutional right
that makes about 25 percent 24
25 idiots
right because you could argue that
something shouldn't be in the
constitution
but it's hard to argue it's not there uh
it's another one of those examples where
25 you can always count on them to be
wrong on everything
all right here's my new section which
will cause you all to get worked up are
you ready
are you ready for some some fighting
ready for some intellectual fighting
come on here it comes
here it comes here's the red meat
coming out all right i call this section
am i wrong
or are you frightened am i wrong
or are you frightened and here's the
concept behind it
an ordinary intelligent person will make
ordinary intelligent
and reasonable decisions when
when their emotions are not involved
if you take that same reasonable person
who's got
perfect perfectly average abilities and
common sense and reasoning
and you put that person in a stressful
scary situation
how good is their reasoning now
not good right so your ability to reason
gets switched off as your emotions go
higher
as you get angrier as you get more
frightened
as you're worried as you're more anxious
your
your sense of reason just switches off
does anybody doubt that we we all agree
with that right
so if you have a situation let's say
hypothetically there was a situation
where there was somebody you knew
who had a really good track record of
being
reasonable and often right a very
reasonable person
and then you're comparing that to that
reasonable person to another one who's
just as reasonable
two very reasonable people they're often
right
see things clearly now we're to make one
tweak
they're both reasonable they're both
usually right
but one of them is now really scared
one's really frightened now they start
to disagree on a topic
one is not frightened and is reasonable
most of the time
one is pretty scared and they have
different opinions now who's right
which one of them is more likely to have
the right opinion
because remember same intelligence same
information
but one of them is scared and one of
them isn't
yeah the calm person statistically
you should expect that the calm person
has the advantage
now let's talk about vaccine passports
i'm not afraid of vaccine passports
now you should you might argue that i
should be and we'll talk about that in a
minute
but as a statement of fact i'm not even
a little bit concerned about them
but the people who disagree with my
opinion which i'll state in a minute
those people are really really concerned
like they're really scared now
a lot of people are saying the following
comment scott i like your opinions in
general but
wow you're all over the place on these
vaccine passports
because you think maybe it should be a
good idea
and you're way off on this one you've
got a lot of stuff right but you're way
off on this vaccine passport thing
so i ask you this step back for a moment
i have no fear of it whatsoever which
doesn't mean i'm right
right that doesn't mean i'm right i'm
just saying i have no fear
and you've watched me for however long
you've watched me and you thought that i
was reasonable until now
but here's an object where you have a
topic where you have a lot of fear
and now where our opinions are different
what do you think is going on
what do you think is going on here is
the problem that you're afraid
and it's affecting your judgment or
is this one of those times when
different from my pattern
i'm just way off i'm way off in a bad
opinion which of those is more likely
all right i'm going to read some of the
comments to my tweet this morning
and i'm going to tell you what i think
of their reasoning
okay so here are the people who are
disagreeing with me so i've said that
vaccine passports will be fine now it
doesn't mean
it'll make anything better i'm just not
afraid of them
and here's my argument we already have
driver's licenses right
did the the putting your name into a
database and giving you a driver's
license
did that ruin your life somehow or
or did it just make it safer to drive
didn't really hurt much if you get a
mortgage you have to show your taxes
was that a slippery slope to losing your
health care information
no no um and how about your health care
information has anybody
gotten access to that do we have laws
that keep your health care stuff
private has anybody gotten access to you
know most of it we're talking about just
the vaccination part
but has anybody gotten access to the
whole database yet
not yet not yet i mean i suppose it's a
risk
but not yet so we live in a world in
which the government has
often put these restrictions on us to
put us in a database
and know something about us right now
the big argument that i've heard from i
guess this is from naomi wolf
so she's quite famous for being a
skeptic
on some of the coronavirus stuff and the
first thing i would say
is beware of skeptics skeptics are
you know valuable got to have them i am
one
but there's a skeptic trap and you
should be aware of it
the skeptic trap goes like this once you
become the skeptic
it's hard not to be the skeptic and
you're going to want to have at least a
win
in your skeptical thing so it's it's the
there's a bias that would affect you
know the ivor cummins of the world
skeptic um alex berenson
skeptic about some aspects of the
coronavirus in both cases
and naomi dr naomi wolf also a skeptic
now here's my problem with skeptics once
you're known
as the famous skeptic and you're getting
a lot of attention
and reward for being that famous skeptic
you kind of need to be right meaning
that even if you're wrong you need to be
right
whereas somebody who hasn't committed
that forcefully to the position
and i would argue that i haven't i've
been all over the place on different
coronavirus stuff
so i don't feel like i would be labeled
as a skeptic
or labeled as a believer i'm somewhere
in the middle
so i would argue that if you're
somewhere in the middle you're less
likely to be
influenced by the bias of needing to be
right about something big
but if you're out there all the time
being the skeptic you kind of have that
really big bias
and just be aware of that now does that
mean that any of them are wrong
no no i'm not telling you that any of
them are wrong on anything
i'm not sure i would know but
just have that little bit of you know
knowledge in the back your head that
once you're the skeptic person
you got a little extra bias there
all right so just be careful about that
and i'm sure that that
that the same concept would apply to me
uh whenever i've committed to a position
so be aware of it here are some comments
about people who are
against the vaccine passport i won't
read their names
i'll just talk about the comment itself
all right
it's discrimination against the free
will of the people who do not want to
get vaccinated
is that true would it be discriminating
against
we'll say that the freedom i think is
the point the freedom of the people who
do not want to get vaccinated
that's true it definitely discriminates
against their freedom but isn't that
true of a driver's license
isn't that true getting a loan people
who don't have tax returns can't go on
is it true of travel you can't travel
anywhere unless you have a passport
so this is a true statement it
discriminates against your freedom
but that's not a reason because we do it
all the time
so the society all of his civilization
the entire civilization is built on
restricting your freedom
that's what it is you don't build a
civilization to give people freedom
all of civilization is a restriction of
freedom
and it's but it's designed to be a wise
restriction
it restricts the things that you'd want
to restrict this is just another one of
them
so i don't think you can i don't think
it is a
reasonable to disagree with it in
concept
as as a reduction of freedom because all
of civilization is a reduction of
freedom
you can't drive your car on the sidewalk
they built a road
to restrict where you drive the car it's
all restrictions
all right let's let's do some more
reasons
the the us government couldn't execute
this in a way that
so there's a practical element to it so
somebody says it might be impractical
that's a good point if your argument is
that
we can't get it up in time somebody else
argued that a lot of people got
vaccinated without
showing id so what do those people do
if you got vaccinated but you didn't
show idea at the time
but your name is still in the system
right if you got vaccinated or not
so there might be some practical
limitations to it which are perfectly
that would be a good skeptical
comment if you just can't do it
that's a reason not to do it it just
can't be done
so if it's not accurate then yeah
of course it's a problem but i don't
know that for sure and the argument
about it
is usually not on the practical level
there are some arguments
um once the system uh and the precedent
exists factions within the government
can take them
and bend them in their own purposes ah
now we're getting to the real good stuff
so the problem is that once you have a
platform and this is dr naomi wolf's
argument
that once you have a platform where
there's something about you in this case
the vaccination or not
is in the database and that's going to
restrict you from let's say businesses
or travel
or or government things once you have
that system
they can add anything to that system
can't they
they can add anything to that next thing
you know
maybe the next thing they add to it you
don't like so much
even if you think the vaccination thing
is a good idea
slippery slope isn't it
do you know what else is a slippery
slope
computers if we allow ourselves to have
computers somebody's going to put some
information in those databases
now we're not going to like it or how
about
driver's licenses there's a database
of your driver's license that has your
weight
your address your height your
eye color your hair color i think
couldn't they use and and then it's also
used to restrict what you can and cannot
do
so if you don't have id of some sort you
can't fly you can't do a lot of stuff
so couldn't they take the driver's
license platform
because it's just a database and add
stuff to it
see where i'm going i don't think we
should have driver's licenses
because that database could be expanded
into a social credit
system couldn't it do you know what else
could be expanded into a social credit
system
any database it's just the database
yes you can put bad things in the
database
you could put good things in the
database but you don't get rid of
databases
because somebody could misuse it so
could somebody misuse this system
yes they could misuse every
system that's not a reason not to do it
you have to weigh the you know the risk
against the benefits right
um so here's my
uh best argument by of why i'm not
worried
number one it might be impractical like
once they roll it out the odds of it
working i don't know
might be impractical so it might might
never even be a problem
number two um i believe that
transparency
and market competition is all you need
to make sure that it doesn't go too far
now everything goes too far
before it gets pulled back right so
things do go too far and then get pulled
back
so we might find that this will go too
far and get pulled back
but as long as uh let's
let's work it through let's say the
government says you can't travel
unless you have a vaccination
same as now i i traveled recently and i
couldn't do it without getting a test
that goes in the database that the
airline can see
that says i got a negative cova test
what's the difference between that
the current situation that i'm in a
database saying i got a cova test
or one that says i got a vaccination
it's the same damn test
i mean it's the same process right once
you're in the system
so were people complaining that the
airlines required you to get a test
because once you have that platform that
allows the
the airlines to know if you got a test
they could add things to the platform so
when you're talking about the
vaccination platform
you already have one the platform
already was built it was for the tests
whether you got tested or not so i don't
think the flight thing
is anything because it's just the
current situation that seems to be
no big deal what about individual
businesses
let's say you need a vaccination to go
to a basketball game
where the seats are filled let's say
that's the case
and let's say that the public says hey
i'm going to boycott your basketball
game because of this rule
if enough people boycott it what's going
to happen
well they either won't have the game or
they'll change the rule or
some time will pass and we don't need
the vaccinations right
so the the public response and market
competition
is gonna kind of take care of this i
think as long as you've got to have lots
of visibility
the problem i think would be a lack of
visibility
now in america do you think that we
could take this to the next level of
social what is it that china has the
social credit
system where you have to do a whole
bunch of things right
or else you get in their database as a
bad person
we're not too far from that now are we
we have a social credit database
did you know that did you know you're
already in a social credit database in
the united states
well one of them is your credit score
literally your credit score
right that is a social credit how how
trustworthy are you
do you pay back your debts we have that
it already exists that's just one form
of it
we also have this thing called the
internet which you've probably heard of
you can go on the internet on social
media and you can find out
quite a bit about people and you can
find out how good or bad they are
fairly reliably by looking at their
social media
background so i would argue that
the woke-ism is a social credit system
i don't even know if it would be worse
if we turned it into a database
now i'm not in favor of that turning
into a database but the current system
is pretty damn bad the the wokeness
stuff
is pretty pretty bad i would say we do
have a social credit
system so you're worried about the thing
that's already here
i suppose it could get worse but
it's here you already have it
all right so let me read a couple more
reasons here just to
show you the types of objections
um all right
i want to see some good comments here
from david uh reboy so
here's a somebody i know to be a higher
level
thinker and commentator on twitter so
this would be a better
a better quality of objection says my
objection isn't
uh even really related to the vaccine
the passport infrastructure will
encourage private companies of every
kind to engage in an emerging
social credit system right now
um again that could be
i i suppose you could see it going that
way but what would be the next thing
that got added
what exactly would be the next thing in
the
progression
somebody says poison is bad for your
health thank you
um somebody's saying i'm framing travel
by uh international standards not
domestic that's right
but the point stays the same that
because international travel is a big
enough thing
that that's a fair example um
how long is immunity yeah somebody's
asking a good question how long does
immunity last
so if you got vaccinated does that
really mean anything i supposed to be a
date on there
so um here's what i
feel like a lot of people are saying
that this feels like a slippery slope
and it reminds you of nazi germany
every time you see yourself saying wait
a minute that reminds me of nazi germany
there should be a flag that goes off in
your head
wait a minute why am i always reminded
of nazi germany every time there's a
political conversation
it's because it's the weird extreme
that's in all of our minds it's not
because everything is like that
so just being reminded of something else
is not a reason
if you are reminded of nazi germany you
are probably
looking at this with fright as opposed
to
reason now let me say as carefully as i
can
you could all be right and i could be
wrong
nothing rules that out right so if
you're hearing me say i'm
right right right and you're all wrong
you shouldn't be hearing that
and what i'm saying is that i'm not
seeing any reason to be afraid because
it looks like normal business to me
it just doesn't seem that extreme as
long as you have market competition
as long as you have visibility as long
as the public
can get its way and it can if it pushes
hard enough
i'm not especially afraid of it so
yes i wouldn't worry about nuremberg and
nazis and hitler every every time you
look around a corner
hitler is not under the bed hitler is
not under the bed
do you remember when the coronavirus was
first hitting and a lot of people
thought that it would be the end of our
supply chains and
civilization would crumble and i was
telling you
no no no don't be operating on fear
logically we will adjust and we'll
figure out how to get you food
and then we did just that we figured out
how to adjust
we took the risks we needed to take we
got everybody
fed for the most part so just keep in
mind
that when you've been the most
frightened is when you've made the worst
decisions so if there's somebody that
you think has been right before
and they're not frightened by the
current topic
maybe you should give them a little bit
more credibility
than you should even give yourself if
you're operating from fear
doesn't mean you're wrong by the way
fear is a good thing but just play the
statistics
all right
the ex-cdc chief says he does think that
the
kova 19 came or the coronavirus
came from some lab now
um his argument i hadn't heard before
and it goes like this
that it's actually hard to get a
an animal virus to be compatible with a
human
and even if it trans even if it gets to
a human
it tends not to be very viral
because it's not a very effective virus
but
i guess the way that you can make an
animal virus really really bad for
humans
is to expose it to human cells in a
lab and you get the virus basically
trained
you know or to evolve if you will or to
mutate i guess
until it is really really bad for humans
and the speculation here and i think
you'd have to call it
sort of educated statistical reasoning
is that it's unlikely that this thing
could have
as quickly become so viral unless there
was some
yeah weaponization happened now the
weaponization
doesn't mean that they intended anything
to get out so that's a separate question
but but the statistics of it according
to
dr redfield cdc head
is that it's unlikely that in the time
frames we're talking about a natural
thing could have become this
viral it would have had to be stepped up
they say
and and added a little bit of zing in a
human way
um but i would add to that that doesn't
make it impossible
it just makes it unlikely okay so just
know that we live in a world where
unlikely things do happen fairly
regularly more than you'd expect
but that's a good argument i'm going to
say that's a solid argument
i love this story about ted cruz going
to visit the uh
the biden cages and the all the kids
that are in there
and uh there's the video of the
the worker who's trying to stop him from
filming i think that's sort of a rupaur
video and here's why what you're
watching is
you know i think ted cruz is probably
using his phone camera
uh he's talking to somebody who's trying
to stand in front of him and stop him
from filming
the people are in the cages or the boxes
the biden boxes
and the part that's left out
is the reason that she's trying to stop
it
right and i feel like there should have
been two reasons
one of the reasons i believe is valid
which is there's a privacy reason
and i believe that if you're just
filming people uh
and you can see their faces in a world
of
facial recognition that does sort of put
those people in a
in let's say a more vulnerable spot if
their faces get into a database because
somebody took a picture of it so i'm
going to say that that part was actually
reasonably uh responsible
but then the other part is are they just
trying to stop embarrassment
and that's not valid because we do get
to see this
right that we should be able to see this
we can't fix it unless the public gets
excited about it so uh a plus
to senator cruz for excellent theatrics
and politics as well
i think that was exactly the right thing
to do what he did bring bring a bunch of
senators in
elbow your way in there don't take don't
take no for an answer
don't let anybody stop you if you have a
moral
authority to do what you're doing and he
did he had moral authority which is
greater than their authority and he took
it
he just he basically just expressed
moral authority and got away with it
very good
very very good work i would say and good
for the country
we wanted to see that um
all right that is pretty much what i
want to talk about
somebody says the faces are blurred
before broadcast yeah if
if you're being responsible and the
pictures that i did see
they were blurred but what the worker
could not know
is whether ted cruz would do that and
that's fair right
now if it had been a let's say a
professional news crew
you might have had a little more
certainty that they would um
agree to and actually blur out the faces
but was ted cruz going to go through all
the editing of blurring out
you know dozens of faces probably not
probably not
somebody says do illegals get a right to
privacy
but here i would question the use of the
word right
and my answer is probably not i mean i
assume that if you're not
a legal citizen you don't have all the
same protections maybe you do
actually maybe you do i guess i'm not
enough of a lawyer to know the answer
that
maybe you do but i don't think it's the
right question
the reason that privacy um is even an
expectation is because all of us think
it's something that
people should have like regardless of
what the law
is we all kind of think people
should get some privacy so i don't think
that whatever the law is or the
constitution
should be the guiding principle in this
case because there's there's a moral law
on top of that that's just bigger
it's just bigger um
once they're on u.s soil then they do
somebody says
we should all have privacy and also
vaccine passports
okay well the thing with privacy
and the thing with all of my arguments
is that if you ever see any of them as
absolutes
the problem's on your end because i
don't present anything as an absolute
privacy is good but also
restricting what people can do so that
you can have a functioning civilization
is also good they can both be good
right you could have you could have
times when you're trading one for the
other
there's nothing wrong with that
somebody says moral laws have no place
outside of religion
well moral laws don't
maybe but but acting in a moral way
you could take away the word law if you
like but acting in a moral way
is just something we should expect of
each other
it doesn't have to be on the books
privacy is a form of public restriction
that's correct good point
that's right if you have privacy you're
restricting me
from that information now i'm not saying
that's wrong
i'm just saying that there is no such
thing as
just freedom to have a civilization
it's all about restriction that's what
makes it a civilization is restriction
mind your own business somebody says
that's a that's a perfectly perfectly
reasonable statement
so if somebody says you know our
philosophy or our point of view should
be everybody just mind your own business
if you could be consistent on that you'd
have something
the trouble is it's not one of those
things you can be consistent on
because we really can't mind our own
business and
live in the same physical place you
could try
but it couldn't possibly work
um oh so there's a
there's a great fake news story about i
guess a couple of
rappers or hip-hoppers or whatever is
the the best word
musical lacks uh or creating a
satan-based sneaker with a drop of human
blood in each
sneaker to which somebody on twitter
asked
do you really think there's a drop of
human blood in each of those sneakers
i'm gonna go out on a limb and say that
it's one of the best marketing schemes
you'll ever see because we're all
talking about it
but i don't think there's a drop of
blood in every sneaker
i mean anything's possible but i'm just
gonna say
i don't really think there's a drop of
blood no sneakers
um yeah weirdos
all right uh i don't know how many of
those satanic sneakers are going to sell
but they certainly did a good job in
letting us know they're out there
all right i'm just looking at some of
your comments all right that's all i got
for now um
today i'm going to start recording the
audio book
which is actually a re-recording because
another artist did the original
so this will be the first time i'll be
recording my own book how to fail
almost everything and still win big
it'll take months before you can
actually buy it
but next three days i'm gonna be leaving
here and
recording all day in the studio and uh
i hope that you like the audiobook when
it's done
and i will talk to you later
all right um pre-sale
uh not for the audiobook yet i'll tell
you when it's available
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you later
