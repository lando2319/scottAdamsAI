good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the finest time
of the weekend and every other day too
if you'd like this experience which is
already extraordinary to go to levels
that nobody can even understand with
their small human brains you need AI for
that and I'm not talking about large
language models yeah you'd need AI for
that or alternately all you need is a
CER marar glass a tanker chelin a Cen
jug or flas a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine day of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called simultaneous Sip and it happens
now
ah very
good well the news is not uh super
interesting today so I'm just going to
add jokes to all of it is that okay I'll
just add jokes to all of the news if I
have any well they don't they're not all
joke uh let's see we'll start with
Matthew
Perry we know what happened to him now
it was a ketamine overdose which
apparently caused him to lose
Consciousness and then I guess he
slipped into his hot tub
so did anybody have drug overdose as
their their bet I have to admit I was
thinking it was fentel but could have
been anything so I've never heard of
aamine uh well I don't know if it's an
overdose but if he had not been in a hot
tub he probably just would have passed
out and awakened so yeah it's more about
the drowning than the overdose
correct well there's a brand new new
digital girlfriend app uh Digi is the
company dig.
aai and it's sort of cartoon looking but
it's sort of like Jessica Rabbit you
know kind of a attractive cartoon
looking character and I don't know why
people are excited about it but it got a
lot of attention today
um and I want I'm going to ask you this
tell me in the
comments um I happen to know that my
audience includes a lot of people who
don't spend time with other people um
would you use a digital
companion how many of you do you if
you're willing to admit it how many of
you are willing to use a digital
companion now the ones who are saying
no
um I I feel like you have to establish
your human bonafides or something it's
like no I would never do that do you
know what this feels
like this feels like
1985 when you ask somebody if they look
at porn does anybody is anybody old
enough to remember that in 1985 if you
said hey do you look at porn what would
people say
no no what what why would you even ask
that well who who looks at porn besides
like creepy perverts I I don't need it I
don't need it I don't need any porn not
me I don't even know why you're asking
that question why are you looking at me
why would you even ask me about that
question and then you fast forward to
the
2000s do you look at porn yeah I really
love the stuff am I
right you you get a completely different
answer in the 2000s than you did in the
80s very
different so I just asked this question
how many of you would have an consider
having an AI companion and people are
like no no no no no no no way there's no
way you're going to get me with a AI
companion well let me check back with
you in about 20 years maybe
40 yeah I I think at least half of you
who said no way will it indeed have
digital companions that's my prediction
I don't think this technology is quite
there but I'm going to I'm going to tell
you something without too much
details yesterday I
sampled uh I'm going to be very vague
here so don't ask me for details I'm
vague intentionally for your benefit so
this is vagueness for your benefit not
mine there there is a digital product
that I'm not going to
describe that gives you the sensation of
being with a
human and I I tried it out yesterday and
it's not porn it's not porn and my God
oh my
God it gives you an experience that I
can't even
explain now so far the thing I'm talking
about which is a digital product is not
combined with
AI can you guess what it is that the
other thing
is yeah he probably can but it's not
porn but when you combine it with with
AI is going to blow your mind
out and you don't see it coming but I've
experienced it so I can tell you that
the the empty feeling you get from
looking at a cartoonish
AI partner is going to be kind of bland
and two-dimensional and it won't really
have much impact on you there there
won't be that many people who fall in
love with a cartoon version of a person
but there's another level
and the the and the level that's coming
is like a 100x times these little
cartoony characters yeah there's
something coming you don't see it yet
but you will
anyway Mickey Mouse is coming off
copyright but not entirely so I guess
now the copyright laws protect some
stuff for 95 years and the original
Mickey Mouse animated Steven boat Willie
little black and white cartoon from 95
years ago uh is just coming off a
copyright so you can now legally create
not the modern uh Mickey so modern
modern Mickey Mouse is still protected I
don't know how they get away with that
but uh the the original version if you
were to draw one just like that I think
you could even call it Mickey Mouse that
part I don't know do they maybe a lawyer
can tell me this are there any lawyers
who are watching right now but but
Mickey Mouse is probably
trademarked so probably you could draw
the character but you could not name it
Mickey
Mouse yeah I think that's correct so
it's not going to be that much impact on
Disney so that it's not going to affect
their stock price however there's a
really good chance that uh the dilber
character will uh have a new friend for
ratbert so if you follow Dilbert you
know rap bird is one of the characters
so he might get Mickey Mouse bird Mouse
bird but it would have to be the steam
Willie
version I saw Jesse Waters yesterday in
Fox News talking about how we still
don't have the Epstein flight
logs and he he was suggesting that the
people not releasing them uh you know
maybe have some culpability or why can't
we see them now I agree that when it
comes to the government
you should expect the worst and assume
the worst if there's no
transparency however I'm going to
vigorously disagree with the public
seeing Epstein's uh flight
logs because do you believe that 100% of
the people who went on Epstein's
flights knew there was something wrong
and knew that they were traveling with a
bad guy or were they just was just rich
people borrowing Jets from other rich
people
oh my Jet's going this way you want to
come
along so I understand why the public is
curious and I understand why you want to
see
it but to me this would be the height of
um improper behavior that this would fly
against everything that's American in my
opinion everything American would be
violated by uh throwing everybody on
that flight log under the
bus well let me ask you how many of you
think that 100% of the people who are
ever on his jet should be ostracized
from Human civilization because that's
what would
happen does anybody think that 100% of
the people on the flights should be
thrown under the
bus no well there's a
yes I think if you said yes you're a bad
person honestly you're just a bad person
and you're going to have to deal with
that for the rest of your life but not
my problem uh here's what I think I
think when you're talking about
individual American citizens they need
to be innocent until proven guilty and
being on a flight log even ab's flight
does not prove he did anything wrong and
I am unless I'm misunderstanding the
issue here maybe I am if if there's if
nobody has been uh accused of a specific
crime
that's their own business that is their
own private business and I'm sure they
all regret that they got on that plane
but it doesn't mean that they're guilty
of any horrible crimes so I absolutely
disagree with Jesse Waters and anybody
else who wants to see the flight logs
are we curious yes yes very curious very
curious should I see them no no I never
want to see
them and and the reason is just be to be
very clear the reason is because
individual citizens are just innocent to
proven guilty and there's no wiggle room
on that like I realize this is not a
wouldn't be a trial but that's why I
don't want to see them you wouldn't want
your privacy violated that way uh
there's a novel method for Uranium
extraction from Wastewater how about
that because we got that uranium
shortage uh but it also generates
electricity while you're doing it whoow
whoa now a lot of you looked at me for
your explanations how science works so
I'd like
to just explain to you in the the
simplest possible ways I'm just going to
keep this simple just just a summary of
how the technology works all right so
here's what you need to know it's a it's
a spontaneous microbial electrochemical
method so that's the first thing you
need to know and what they do is they
spatially decomp the microbial oxidation
uh and the uranium reduction reactions
and it's an innovation that uh what you
do is you got the two Chambers separated
by the proton exchange membrane you got
that right and then obvious obvious
they're going to separate with a proton
exchange membrane then you use an anode
made of carbon felt and a cathode
titanium
foil and then the process uses that as I
said you know not to repeat myself but
the microbial driven Electro mechanical
reaction and that facilitates sort of a
uranium extraction from the Wastewater
which simultaneously generates the
electricity now you know what makes me a
little bit angry about
this well you and I thought of this idea
but didn't do anything about it so I
guess I guess that just tells
you that life life really rewards action
I mean I was just thinking about this
and I'm like huh I want
wonder I wonder if I put two Chambers
separated by a protein exchange mem and
then introduced an anode made of carbon
felt so I was thinking about this the
other day but I did nothing about it so
I feel like an idiot
now well Elon Musk is always in the news
and he's uh dumping on Disney lately he
said that Walt Disney might be turning
in his grave cuz Disney is infected
deeply infected infected with the woke
mind
virus I think he's really trying to make
that woke mind
virus thing you know part of the Comm
Consciousness you know I know number of
people used it before he did but he's
he's really driving it
home and they he says they used to bring
joy to people's life Disney did making
wonderful things their family enjoyed
but
now now it's just B just basically
they're giving you woke
garbage
speaking of woke
garbage um did you know that roughly
oneir of adults under 30 uh regularly
scroll Tik Tok for the news so onethird
of young people are getting their news
from Tik Tok and there's a
Communications expert Molly mcferson who
was at an axios event and she said that
the heartbeat of public opinion is Tik
Tock she's a crisis communication expert
so she would know she and she says says
quote if you're not paying attention to
that content then you're missing out
because that's where the information and
viral Trends
start so viral
Trends start on Tik
Tok do you realize what that means right
it means that
China
literally
literally as a user interface on our
reality because what he what Americans
believe is what they gather from their
media and social media is the main thing
that's influencing the young people and
according to this communication expert
Molly mcferson who's probably
correct the the viral stuff starts on
Tik Tok and then nobody can ignore it
like then then it becomes our
news so here's the path the Chinese
government owns bite dance bite dance
owns Tik Tock Tik Tock has a button
called heat that they can literally push
to make something Trend with which
they've admitted I'm not I'm not making
this up Tik Tok says this so the
government can control the companies in
China that's normal business they have
an actual physical mechanism for making
some things more viral than others and
now we know the rest of the picture
viral things on Tik Tok become the news
and then it becomes our our
consciousness
is still
legal and Congress still says yeah but
you know Free
Speech there's no question whatsoever
the Congress is bought off or
corrupt because they couldn't be that
stupid here I'm being
kind I cannot imagine that Congress is
so stupid that they don't know how much
of a risk this
is they can't be that stupid so so
what's
left it's not a
mistake cuz everybody's telling them you
know that they've engaged in the
conversation so it's not a
mistake what could it be there's only
one thing left corruption there's
literally only one explanation
corruption so anybody who's voting to
keep ticktock legal you know I I will
allow that for the uh you know let's say
the Thomas Massy types who are
absolutist about Free Speech if you're
an
absolutist I'm going to give you a half
a pass half a pass because I do
appreciate
consistency that's worth something but
this is a national uh it's a threat this
is not like a normal communication
thing all right there's a new story
about a quote missing binder a 10-in
binder that disappeared at sometime
around the transition from Trump to
Biden this binder contains classified
information related to uh the the
Russian collusion
claims and apparently uh there was some
thought that the real reason for the
raid on marago is to get that binder
back now some say the binder uh might
have too much information in it about
sources and
methods and that's why they it's so
critical to get it back and and they're
thinking that maybe the information
isn't terribly important but the sources
and methods might
be other people say that's exactly why
Trump has it if he has it there's no
evidence that he has it but if he has it
because apparently there was an effort
to make it um Public public information
but there was a process you know a
lengthy process of redacting stuff that
hadn't been complete
Ed so is there somewhere does somebody
have a binder that could be really
really damaging to maybe some leadership
of the
FBI maybe not just sources and methods
but maybe something
embarrassing maybe so we're only
speculating because we don't know what's
in it but maybe it had something to do
with marago raids that's certainly not
um
I don't have any direct evidence of that
um and maybe Trump had it specifically
because they gave him some blackmail
control over them maybe but I don't have
any evidence of that so we don't have
any evidence of who who has it or what's
in it or why we care but it's one of the
big stories
today it's it's a big story we literally
don't know anything that's true just
nothing I don't know maybe it doesn't
even
exist all right here's a Evergreen story
that I keep going back to um as you know
there appear to be continuing excess
deaths well after the pandemic is over
but the excess deaths weirdly seem to be
concentrated in the
young whereas old people are actually
doing fine in terms of their uh death
does that make sense to you that young
people would have much higher death
after the
pandemic and and old people would be
doing maybe even better than normal to
me that makes perfect
sense I'm I'm actually confused why it's
confusing or why there's even any
mystery to it at all let me explain old
people all of the weak old people died
early that's it that the ones who were
would have maybe held on for a little
bit
longer the co got them and maybe maybe
the pandemic you know
restrictions decreased their quality of
life so much that you know they died a
little early from that so it makes sense
that older people had some excess deaths
and now we're just seeing you know the
the after effect of that but how do you
explain how do you explain young people
dying at an excess
rate well when you read the stories
about the young people dying at an
excess rate does it tell you which
category of death within that group of
people is up which
category how can you read a story like
this that says there's this mysterious
and horrible you know well over 100,000
deaths extra it's in young people you
know where there should be not any
deaths why isn't the most important part
of the
story what they're dying
from how how is that not the most
important part of the story so do you
what do you conclude what do you
conclude from a national like a big
story the young people are dying too
much and the story doesn't mention what
they died
from was it self violence was it an
accident was it drug
overdose was it heart
attacks what was
it what but but before you speculate
about what it was deal with the first
question why would there be a national
story without breaking down the cause of
death how how does that tell you
anything I saw this from Pierre
Corey you know him from you know
pandemic he was a a rogue good doctor
meaning that he was not agreeing with
the consensus on vaccinations and
such does it seem to you that somebody
is trying to suggests that the
vaccinations kill
them that's what I'm getting out of it
because it was Pier Cory who's talking
about it and he's the one who says that
the vaccinations are dangerous but he
doesn't complete the loop he doesn't
complete the loop and say the exact
things that they're dying from are the
exact things we'd worry about a
vaccination having a side
effect you're saying yes he did but not
in the article I saw in the article I
saw he speculated
but he did not mention the the more
recent stuff does not does not define
this specific
causes right now I have seen him I have
seen him say separately and before that
myocarditis was higher in young people
because of vaccinations so I have heard
that but what the insurance companies
are dealing with you know these big
excess deaths they're not they're not
completing the loop they're they're not
saying that you know it seems heart
related and heart related would be
suggestive of maybe something that
happened recently like
vaccinations no
autopsies now when young people die
unexpectedly don't they do
autopsy if a 15-year-old dies of a heart
attack they don't check that
out I I don't know exactly all right so
here's what I I make of it I don't
believe it
I I first don't believe the
numbers and then I
secondly don't believe there isn't an
obvious explanation for it because to me
it seems like the the suicides and the
drug
overdoses would be through the
roof and then I think something happened
to all of us
socially would you agree how how many of
you feel socially damaged by the
pandemic I do I feel permanently Changed
by the pandemic meaning that my my
social impulse is almost none almost
none
yeah yeah so if I were a teen and I had
my social impulse
erased and I just lived online and
watched porn all day and was on social
media I don't know feels like that could
kill you but I don't know what the call
is so I don't want to speculate too hard
it does seem like it might be a whole
bunch of different
things um Elon Musk is going hard at Dei
he says Dei must die in in a
separate uh we had two posts on it he
and he said the point was to end
discrimination not replace it with
different discrimination diversity
Equity inclusion are propaganda words
for racism sexism and other isms and
then later he said this is not just
morally wrong as any other racism and
sexism changing the target class doesn't
make it
right um
yeah so how much do you love the fact
that Elon Musk is going hard at Dei and
ESG and the other racist policies I feel
like we couldn't even have the
conversation without
him how is he not a person of the
year wasn't person of the year like
Taylor Swift or something
Taylor Swift person of the
year oh my God
anyway well by now you probably know uh
that there was a staffer for senator
cardan who is having some um some gay um
sex in uh what was it the some kind of
Senate uh hearing room Senate's large
hearing room so this is the same place
that they've done Senate Supreme Court
confirmations and impeachment
proceedings and and that sort of thing
um and in the video that we see uh it's
two men uh one is taking the other from
behind
apparently um there's no word if they
are
colonizers
colonizers
um other questions that we don't know is
uh is this the reason that the
politicians like Schumer they keep
telling the public that we don't want to
know how the sausage is
made now they've told us you don't want
to know how the sausage is
made were they referring to
this I don't know um is this another
case of uh we've always hear that the
Senators are really interested in
pork I don't know if that's related in
any
way um
but he's probably not the first person
in the room ever to get some pork and
what I really
wonder is were they filming it uh as
sort of a skit for grade school were
they making some content for the young
people no or was it was it just sex it
looked like they were making some kind
of tutorial maybe for grade school I
don't know I'm just guessing I'm just
guessing I just watch the news like you
do I don't know I don't know what was
going on but uh yeah that's how the
sausage was made all right um let let me
say
this I don't want to see them get fired
and I don't
care right all right let's be honest are
we only caring because it was gay
sex is that the only thing that made it
news if this had been heterosexual sex
in the same
room would anybody even be talking about
it you think you would but would we be
talking about the same way would it be
like
funnier no there there's something a
little homophobic about the story that
makes me uncomfortable I like to laugh
at the public sex stories but would it
be funny if they were
heto oh wouldn't be as funny so I guess
that's homophobic in a way
anyway check your check your bigotry on
that one um mayor Boston mayor uh had
the so-called uh uh electeds of color
dinner that went ahead and
uh apparently the dinner just went ahead
and they excluded white people and they
were pretty happy about it they seem
look like they had a good time
um but you know I tweeted yesterday that
the uh the public is waking up to 40
Years of insane level of discrimination
against white men and only this year we
can we can say it out
loud so finally finally you can actually
say but you know discrimination is
against white men at least in in hiring
in corporations has been far worse far
worse discrimination against any other
group not even
close but you couldn't even say that
without you know losing your career a
few years ago so I'm liking this free
speech it's kind of good stuff enjoying
it uh IBM and red hat I guess red Hat's
owned by IBM now uh there was an
internal document at Red Hat uh an
anti-white document that's apparently
still
current uh among so James zkee got a
hold of this from his
whistleblowers
um and it says there are Ten
Commandments for uh that white people
have to
observe the allyship commandments so
it's how to be a good white person in
red hat and one commandment States uh
only white people can be
racist another one is that uh except
that white people are responsible for
dismantling
racism and then another section argues
that whiteness constructs the game hides
the rules and then rigs the game over
and over again so basically it's just
racist
anti-white um stuff in IBM so IBM
is a racist
organization super racist and it's overt
it's not hidden they are overtly
inpublic super
racist against white
people so there's that now people keep
telling me I should be concerned about
things that happened a long time ago for
example uh people are trying to double
dunk on IBM by saying that IBM in World
War II um may have helped Hitler
organized the death camps or something
maybe it's true maybe it's not I don't
give a
 I don't give a what IBM did
with a bunch of dead people 50 75 years
ago whatever is I do not care what they
did then I totally care what they're
doing
now what they're doing now really really
bad but I don't care what what because
all those people are dead there's nobody
to answer for it they're all dead I
don't care you know I don't care that
Volkswagen was Hitler's car Hitler's
Dead all the people who made those
decisions all dead I can just drive a
Volkswagen if I like it
I'm
allowed it's not my preferred car but I
used to have one
um and I certainly don't care about uh I
don't care which political parties
started the
KKK can you stop forwarding me it was
the Democrats that created the KKK I
don't care I don't care they're all dead
every one of them is dead don't care
if the KKK got some you know traction
today well I'd care about that cuz
that's today I don't care about the dead
ones I also don't care what happened in
the Middle East before October
7th and you can't make me care you can
try I don't care I don't care I can tell
you that Israel certainly has to do what
they need to do because of October 7th
that's easy
that one you know
straightforward but before that are you
going to get me to say who was the worst
oh but but 500 years ago this side was
the worst but but 600 years ago this
side was the worst and a thousand years
ago we used to live there I don't give a
 I care that one side has a big army
so they can protect the land that they
say is
theirs the the reality of Israel is that
if they have a military and enough
Military Support well I guess it's their
land I don't care what happened 3,000
years
ago anyway uh you can care but stop
trying to make me care because it won't
work um I'd like to give a shout out
just because I think it's good
form um I've tried to teach you this
many times if you can't say something
good about the people who are on the
other side of a debate then maybe maybe
you're not being as objective as you
think you are so as just sort of a good
hygiene for my brain if I see somebody
on on the opposite side from my opinion
who's doing something worthy I'd like to
call it out and um I think I've made as
much fun of John fedman as anybody in
the public domain but he's apparently
wants to be very tough on immigration
laws
and I'm
sorry I got to say I really respect that
because it's easy to be a Republican and
say you agree with the Republicans it's
tough to be John fedman with everything
he's gone through you know the the heat
that he had on him especially with his
health situation and to get to the end
of that and start to you know function
the way he'd like to or closer to it and
to disagree with your party on something
so basic but his disagree treat is based
on being a reasonable person in the real
world
and I can totally support a reasonable
person in the real world so Federman
with uh with no
but good
job good job uh I might have other
criticisms later but I don't want to do
the I disagree with you on these other
things let me just say good job on this
all
right well still watching uh the the
Trump Thanos threat Thanos being the
Marvel superhero uh villain who could
snap his fingers once his bejweled glove
had all of the jewels in it he would
snap his fingers and the half of all the
people on Earth would
die so here's what I don't understand
about the Democrats on one hand they're
very afraid that Trump will get into
office and half the people in the
country will die or the world I guess uh
on the other hand that would solve
climate
change am I right turns out there's only
one politician who has an actual
solution to climate change Trump
according to Democrats he will snap his
Beed glove and half of the world will
die instantly then no problem you can
have all the energy you need
yeah so I think they're not looking on
the good side of this whole Trump as
Thanos stuff but I would encourage you
to keep mocking
it yeah don't argue it mock it yeah
that's right he's Thanos he's gonna kill
everybody snapping his glove
finger just like he did the first time
he was
President you remember that right when
half of the people died I'm pretty sure
every Democrat said that was going to
happen so I guess they
did meanwhile Rudy Giuliani lost in
court so I guess the two Georgia
election workers you remember one of
them named
Ruby and many of you said uh incorrectly
it turns out there is a video of Ruby
cheating with these ballots and pulling
them out from underneath that table and
running them through the counting
machine
twice and you can see it right on the
video you said and I said I see it and
you said it's right there it's right in
front of you and then I watched it and I
said why don't I see it how come I'm not
seeing it and then I saw a video of
election experts who knew how things
should have worked who watched it and
they said okay that's just normal they
just had some stuff they put on the
table to keep it out of the way they
took it out and they finished it that's
just the normal normal stuff
now apparently Giuliani was not allowed
to show any evidence for his
side now why would you have a a a court
situation where you're not allowed to
show any evidence for your side well
apparently there was some information
that the other side wanted from Giuliani
they refused to give him you know some
digital records and because he was not
playing well with the court the court
said look you either have to accept the
process or you're guilty so he did not
accept the process by giving them the
information they requested so it looks
like the court said all right you know
have it your way if you're not going to
give us the information you're guilty by
almost by definition or by process so
now we're going to talk about the how
much you owe and they decided that what
he owed was uh $148
million $148
billion
does that sound anywhere in the
neighborhood of a reasonable thing cuz
remember Ruby was subjected to much
harassment which is real don't make
light of that that was real and probably
death threats I think she got death
threats that's a serious issue but there
are very few problems that can't be
solved with $148
million but I also think that $14
million might have solved most of her
problems as well she could have done
okay with 14 million I think so I guess
it's so high because the jurors were
considering like the penalty part not
just what what she would need to be
whole but a penalty phase of course this
will be
appealed who knows what will happen I'd
be kind of surprised if some future
Court doesn't throw it out or at least
knock down the uh
award
but I would say that if anybody had the
goods on
Ruby don't you think you'd know it by
now I if anybody in an official capacity
or let's say Giuliani himself had the
goods in other words if he could produce
an expert who would watch the video of
Ruby and say okay here's my expert don't
listen to me listen to the expert and
the expert says oh no you can clearly
see something wrong but where's that
where where is one person who
understands the process watching the
video telling the rest of us oh yeah
here's where the crime was committed
right here I haven't seen
that so from the beginning I thought she
was probably doing just her job and was
not guilty of anything remember I told
you early on that 95% of all the claims
of
rigging would not be true even if some
of them turned to be turned out to be
true so let me ask you given that you
have never seen somebody who knows what
they're talking about watch the video
and point out that there's nothing wrong
with
it or or that there is something wrong
with it nobody's pointing out that there
is something wrong with it while they're
watching the
video I haven't seen it
so how many of you think that Ruby is
guilty of rigging the
election in the comments how many of you
think she's guilty
I'm seeing mixed mixed
answers yeah you know what I'm going to
say right can you anticipate what I'm
going to say you know there's no legal
process against her
right there is no legal process
investigating Ruby you know why because
a cursory investigation shows nothing
was wrong you didn't even need to do a
deep dive they just took a quick look at
it and said this is normal and that was
it
now um I know you're still suspicious
because it's Georgia and you're like oh
maybe maybe the prosecutors in on it who
knows but let me say this about Ruby
she's not the
government Ruby is a citizen of the
United States Ruby is
innocent unless somebody can prove her
guilty and nobody's even and trying cuz
they got nothing
Ruby deserves probably an apology from a
lot of people probably right now is
there some chance that you know somebody
is guilty in ways I don't know well it's
always possible but the standard should
be that it's it's been what two years
now how many years I'm sorry it's almost
four years 3
years and in all that time in 3 years
and she's totally on video you think in
3 years somebody whose alleged crime is
on video there and there's no there's no
legal process against
her that doesn't convince you that there
was nothing
there it does to
me yeah to me it convinces me nothing
was there but let me clarify to make all
of you happy let me
clarify she's an American
citizen she's innocent
100% unless somebody has the goods on
her in a legal process and nothing like
that's happening so um I'm Team Ruby
100% same with Hunter Hunter is innocent
till some process proves and guilty I
will make no exceptions to that
standard all right um there are some
claims by representative Kay Higgins who
is involved in Grill in about the the
January 6 stuff I guess
he uh questions FBI director Ry about
these Federal quote ghost buses so
there's an
allegation which I am not buying
into could be true and it's very
interesting and i' would certainly like
to know more about it but remember this
is an allegation against the
government so the allegation is that the
government had way more under cover
people than they're admitting because
they haven't admitted any number
actually and that they were uh put on
these quot quote ghost buses you know
these unlabeled buses there were so many
Undercovers that they needed buses to
bring them
in that's the
claim that is the
claim Bob let me take a moment if the
best you can do is to insult my critical
thinking then you're a idiot
because I've given you plenty of things
things that would allow you to say for
example Scott did you know the Time
Magazine did an investigation and they
found that you're wrong like that would
be a counter to what I'm saying but
Scott does not have critical thinking is
you being a idiot and not being
able to handle the fact that you don't
have any argument against anything I
said so calm down Bob and off
okay
um but anyway these ghost buses are not
proven
um but there are multiple Witnesses who
say they saw the same thing they say
that the people getting on the ghost
buses were let's say unusually
fit there there are also uh there's a
video or a photograph I saw where there
are a number of people in the crowd on
January 6 who appear to be well
trained because they have like their
hands on the shoulder of the person in
front of them in the crowd you know
trying to keep from being separate at
and stuff and it looked it looked a
little too well trained some people are
saying so because this is a alleged
government activity I'm going to say
guilty until proven
innocent right so the exact opposite
standard for Ruby and for Hunter for
them innocent are proven guilty but if
there's an allegation of ghost buses and
we don't know enough about
them guilty
guilty it if they would like to tell us
everything they know about the ghost
buses if they would like to tell us
everything they know about the number of
undercover people then I say oh maybe
not guilty maybe just doing your
job but if you're not going to tell us
guilty doesn't mean they're guilty but
that's the working assumption when your
government doesn't give you uh full
transparency same with the election that
I have no I no specific knowledge of
something wrong with the election
ction but it's not transparent so I make
I make the the reasonable assumption
about any non-transparent government
entity or process same assumption for
all of them all
crooked no Ruby is not equal to the
government she's somebody who worked
there for a day on you know just on the
election that that's definitely not no
no more than Hunter
was
um
a federal
judge is uh warning yon musk that he has
to testify at
the you know how many government
processes are working against Elon Musk
right now so there's no question about
it that the government has
weaponized all of its departments
against musk there's no doubt that Biden
called for that action in public when he
said they're going to look into him in a
whole variety of ways or we have lots of
ways and everybody in the government
said oh I guess you want me to
investigate them I'll see what my group
can do and then they did they
did
now like the the fact that the
government is going after
musk when he's he's the most
unambiguously positive force in America
today and they're going after him trying
to take him down are they trying to
destroy everything that's
good like try to think of anything
that's good in America just
anything what is it they're not trying
to destroy they meaning Democrats I
can't think of anything good that
they're not actively trying to destroy
anything the economy the Border
anything
anyway um there's a company that lets
you be a truck driver from your house so
it's a basically a mostly self-driving
truck the company is I saw this in a
post by Linus ekin Stam the company is
iride
European and they already are an
operation and it's a self-driving truck
but they have uh humans who sit in front
of a monitor to make sure that no human
interaction is needed so the human only
gets involved in the edge cases and if
the human needs to take a
break uh they just have another human
who's also working remotely take over so
that they're watched all the time now
would you trust a human whose job is to
watch a monitor just in case there's a
problem how how long could you sit and
watch the road without doing
anything could you sit there for eight
hours and just go yeah still looks good
still looks good I I think it'd be like
those guards who were supposed to be
watching Epstein you know they were
asleep I think I would have had a like a
maybe I would have had a night job if I
were one of those guards and then I
would just use the daytime to sleep
because what are you going to do just
look at Epstein now there's Epstein
again still looking at him still alive
there he is he's sitting on his bed like
you get real tired of looking at stuff
can
you anyway I think it does give you an
alert if the truck needs your attention
it does send you an alert but I don't
know how much time I would spend
actually looking at the
monitor I feel like I'd carry my phone
around in case I got an alert and I
would just go on with my day if I got an
alert I'd be like oh steer over to the
left a little bit
there all
right um
so the uh Trump lead in the polls
continues pretty much every news story
about a new poll is a new commanding
lead by Trump everything's going in One
Direction only you know Pro Trump
but there is some polling that suggests
that the race would tighten up
considerably if Trump got um
convicted so if Trump gets any
conviction on any of his 91 counts uh
the poll are telling us that people
might turn against them and vote for
Biden does that sound right to
you that to me that sounds super
obviously
wrong like super extra obviously
wrong are are they trying to Prime
people to act that way that would be
almost exactly the opposite of what
would
happen if you put him in ja he's going
to be the
president let let me say that as clearly
as I can if they put Trump in jail you
guarantee him the presidency guarant
fuckinge it yeah no doubt about
it I'd even vote I might even vote in
that
case yeah yeah make no mistake he's not
going to
jail yeah do we agree on that the the
legal process might find you know that
they they want to put him in jail but
let let me just say this
clearly uh I got 80 million reasons he's
not going to
jail I got 80 million reasons
he's not going to jail I think it'll be
scary and risky and it's always
possible but no no no there there
you you think Democrats don't know where
the line is and I think sometimes they
don't know where the line is it's
because conservatives are not um easily
flustered so they they Bend and bend and
bend and bend and bend and bend and bend
and bend and bend and bend and bend and
bend right are you sick of
it doesn't it seem like the Republicans
just keep
bending and they just bent over two far
but here's the thing that would make a
Democrat um be
confused if the people you let's say
persuading against keep
bending you keep pushing right why
wouldn't you if it keeps working keep
doing it but I think the mistake is to
think that the bending is a slippery
slope that just keeps bending and that
is very much not the personality of much
of the country much of the country wants
to ignore literally everything that they
can ignore until they can't ignore it
anymore so if you put him in
jail nobody can ignore that nobody can
ignore
it so it can't happen
yeah now I suppose there's a possibility
that some information would come up that
even a republican would say you know
that was that's so bad he does have to
go to jail but we have seen that
everything looks just like weaponized
Department of Justice it doesn't look
like doesn't look like the normal legal
process is working against them it looks
political
so if Trump goes to
jail I would feel as if I were already
in
jail would
you like I I feel um because he's in a
sense a standard Bearer for a certain
sensibility in this
country if they put him in jail I would
feel like I'm
next like the most of the things that
happen in the news don't feel
personal it's like even a war if you
don't know anybody who's in the war
shooting it doesn't feel personal it's
like a topic in the news but if you put
Trump in jail I would feel that in every
part of my body
and I would clear I would clear my
schedule and I would do nothing but
trying to fix that cuz that would be too
far way too
far and part of me actually wishes it
happened I don't wish him to be in jail
but there's some fights you want you
know what I mean do you ever have that
feeling there are fights you want to you
want to avoid and that would be most of
them you should avoid most fights but
there are fights you
want there are fights you want January
6th is a fight I
want yeah I would also
suggest that we consider January 6 a
holiday anybody up for
that does anybody want to celebrate
January 6 as a um Turning Point
because although we have not realized
that Turning
Point the election of trump should it
happen would be the completion of that
January 6 was an OP against the American
people it was a scop meaning the way it
was framed not the event itself it was
clearly a scop it was uh whether whether
or not the uh undercover people were
important to the outcome or not I think
they were but
even even separate from that the way it
was
framed by the media and the Democrats
was so illegitimate and so corrupt that
it felt like a turning point to me that
felt and especially when the J Sixers
start going to jail you as they have
that's way too
far that that is literally
violence yeah jailing people for those
things you know the ones who are not
violent themselves the nonviolent people
are being jailed that is violence
against them would you agree you put
somebody in jail that's
violence that is violence I'm in favor
of it if they did real crimes but it's
violence so January 6 is the point where
your government became
violent because of your
opinions that's
new that's
new so I think we should celebrate it as
the turning point where the left went
too
far you could all you could call it a
too far day that was the day they went
too far because I think that that the
the way the January 6ers were treated is
probably one of the biggest animating
forces behind people saying you know
what Trump might have some rough edges
but all of that am I right because
I think a lot of Republicans were
willing to accept that Trump was a
flawed candidate in all the the ways we
always talk
about and and their first choice was to
get a nice clean candidate they could
support that was first choice until the
January 6ers started going to
jail as soon as the January 6ers started
going to jail the nonviolent
ones that was too far and that made at
least in my mind
Trump's
reelection
um a
necessity now to be clear I'm still
backing uh V ramaswami and I I think
he'd be a better president because he's
he's younger and I think age
matters uh but if he if he doesn't make
the uh the Final
Cut um it's got to be
trump it just has to be because January
6 can't
go it can't go without a
response it just can't go without a
response now if a said he's going to you
know do pardons on day one for the
January Sixers who were
nonviolent now I'll accept that so I'll
take v as a solution and I'll take Trump
as a
solution um but I don't know if the
others have said has Des santis said out
loud that he would pardon the the nonv
January 6ers you did I say yes and a
no but disantis is not hammering on the
point though
right it I'm saying
NOS I don't think he said no did he all
right so we have a little bit of a
question on what danes's view on that is
now that's
disappointing imagine DeSantis is
running as a
republican he is and we don't
know if he would pardon the J Sixers on
day one how do we not know
that because I think he would but he
hasn't said
it I feel like he would have said it
directly I don't know maybe he said he
was open to looking at it or something
like that which would be you know a fair
political thing to
say h interesting he said he would
consider it I I think I think I think
that's probably the reason that we're
not sure because he said he would
consider it which is a good
non-answer
okay all right I'm seeing a comment is
frustrating me let me say it just once
so everybody here sees it if you think V
took money from Soros and is a Soros
puppet do a little bit of homework okay
don't don't bring that
here like that're we're well beyond
believing that the has some kind of
Soros connection you should worry about
right or that big Pharma controls them
th those are just coming from the
opposition there's nothing to that
there's nothing to it nothing now there
there was some minor connection that
he's explained away if you haven't heard
the explanation don't bring that here go
go do a little bit more work
just Google it listen to find V
explaining his response to those
accusations right but if you haven't
heard that don't don't bring that here
that's crazy
yeah all right uh let's see what uh the
IDF has admitted that the three hostages
who were released I guess they had white
flags they're waving the white flags and
uh they were killed and the IDF um has
taken full
responsibility now I have two things to
say about that it it's a tragedy of
almost unspeakable Dimension the fact
that they were that close to being freed
so you know your brain is just crushed
by the
story and so let let's not you know lose
sight of that but uh despite the tragedy
which we're not
minimizing I have to say the fact that
the idea f um said they did it and
didn't make an excuse for
it I got to respect that I got to
respect that and it does make me more
likely to believe whatever is the next
thing they tell me which is tough
because in that war context I'm not
really expecting to believe
anybody but wow sort of a sort of a
model of how to behave I would say
if if you've done something this bad and
within you know fairly fairly short
period of
time you say yes this was us no
excuses that's pretty good i' I'd like
to see more of that but less
tragedies well AI uh appears to have
broken some kind of barrier we didn't
think it would break so Google's Deep
Mind which correct me on this is not a
large language model right Deep Mind was
an earlier version of AI before the
large language models do I have that
right I got a yes over here I think
that's right but using Deep Mind in
conjunction with uh some other
AI they solved some math problems that
had not been solved
before and apparently
the uh let's see if I can do a good job
of explaining this if you have
a few different types of AI so deep mind
is one technology large language models
another that the big
one can interact with the other ones and
that it's almost like a
brainstorming um system of humans except
it's two AIS checking each other's work
so one of them will throw on ideas and
the other one will check them and then
you know recheck things and stuff so in
in
effect this this is not how the story
was reported this is my own twist on
it AI just learned how to be
creative so as a creative human being
who does it for a living you know I have
to create lots of stuff every day in my
mind the the way I um visualize the
process is uh multiple people in my head
uh one of them is pitching and then the
others are evaluating pitch evaluate
pitch evaluate but the piture is never
evaluating the piture is just pitching
and then there's maybe another part of
my brain that works out if if it's
practical right so there's one that's
just how about this how about this not
thinking too much there's another one
saying yes or no and and then it's
working with the the one that looks at
things practically so there are at least
three three brains in my head working
simultaneously right and i' I've told
you that that when I did my micro lesson
on uh one of those brains is the
executive it's the one in
charge but if you imagine the AI could
use that same model so that instead of
having an AI that would be like just one
part of your brain but if you're trying
to reproduce human capabilities
especially creativity it does make sense
to me that you would have a pitcher and
a catcher you've got one coming with
ideas and one check in the ideas and
they may even be different
Technologies and if that doesn't work
perhaps one of them can uh call upon yet
another one say oh two people in the
room is not much of a brainstorm so
let's bring in a third
AI is it possible that even though the
story is about solving a math problem
what they really
solved was creativity for
AI now I've told you that cre this is
one of my famous quotes that's on the
internet all the
time that creativity is allowing
yourself to make
mistakes and art is knowing which ones
to
keep have you ever heard me say that so
creativity is if I'm going to draw let's
say a picture of an animal or a person
if I give it two eyes and two
ears that's not that's not a mistake
right it's also not
art if I gave him one
eye uh maybe it's art but it's a
mistake so if it's a mistake that I look
at and I go I kind of like that that is
Art if you like it as well so for
example Dilbert has no eyeballs and no
mouth that's a mistake but can you
imagine Dilbert with eyeballs in the
mouth it would be
different the fact that he has no
eyeballs and no mouth turned out to be
perfect because he was the uh the
voiceless employee the one who had you
know he was he was blind and deaf and
you know sort of a slave to the
corporation you put him like a mole you
put him in so so having no eyeballs and
no mouth turned out to work and it
turned out to be art Commercial Art but
it's a mistake so you need to be able to
create AI that can make
mistakes and apparently the large
language models are very
mistakey they they do lot I asked what
books I published and had all the all
the answers were wrong so all those
wrong answers were mistakes you know
what books did I publish all wrong
answers but there were interesting
answers they they might have even
suggested a new book book title that I
hadn't written yet it might have
actually come up with the book I should
write that I've have not yet written by
mistake but if that mistake turned into
a real book because it you know the
brainstorming worked on me well then it
turns into art so AI has to learn how to
make
mistakes
productively otherwise they can't be
creative you need to make lots of
creative mistakes and then you analyze
the creative mistakes like your like
your p for gold it's like ah there's a
mistake now useless there's a mistake
useless there's a mistake useless
there's a mistake whoa why did that
mistake make me feel something it's a
mistake it's a mistake but I felt
something now you get
art so this is a way bigger potential
deal than most of you think and you're
wondering why I'm spending so much time
on it but if AI can solve
art it can kind of do
anything that's a pretty big bar and I
wasn't sure it could cross it but this
idea of the multiple brains working as
one brain the way a human brain does
that might be the Breakthrough that that
might be the logical breakthrough is
it's got to be multiple entities uh
struggling all right and that ladies and
gentlemen is all I have to say on
today's best live stream you'll ever
see is there any uh story I forgot that
is so important I I saw a story on
social
media about some votes in full Fulton
County
Georgia that were being questioned or
tossed out but then I checked the news
today and I didn't see it was that story
real
do do you know if that was
real yeah so the the claim was 177,000
invalid ballots from the 2020
election Andrew claven cited my hoaxes
oh
good so some people say it's real but
it's not news how could it be real and
the News isn't covering it it's on
social media but not in the news
not in the left or the right it's not on
Fox News is
it so I'm going to put a I'm going to
put a question mark on that one big
question mark on that one I don't know
if that's real is it an old claim
somebody says this is an old claim might
be an old claim so that's why I didn't
talk about it all
right uh the pole workers lied to the
GPI about you and meaning the speaker
Mark and threaten said I threaten them
wow oh yeah so there's a new movie
called The American Society of magical
Negroes which suggests that the the
danger in the world is white people or
something like
that um and as others have pointed out
wait a minute if you change the
ethnicities of the people in this movie
it would go from a funny uh send up to
something terrible I'm going to hold my
opinion on this
one because it is intentionally a
comedy and
comedies can be
challenging so if here's here's what I
think if it turns out it's
hilarious and you watch the movie and
you go okay that's just funny then I'm
not going to care what they
said if it's funny
if it's not
funny and it comes off as racist that's
a big
problem but I I looked at the trailer
and I thought it might be actually
funny I think I'll probably watch it so
you know I'm I'm prepared to be you know
deeply offended if it turns out that way
but I think I'm more more uh primed to
think it might be just edgy and funny
and
um you you know worthy
right is still programming yeah but
humor humor is its own category humor
can influence you but sometimes it's
okay because joke's a joke so I tend to
be very forgiving about humor so for
example in in the uh in the trailer to
the movie it shows a scene where there's
a young black guy walking through a some
party atmosphere filled with white
people and he's feeling all
awkward and you know then that's kind of
the point of it is that he's awkward
around the white people and I thought to
myself I could totally watch this movie
because I would love to see you know a
perspective I don't think about or
wouldn't you know like I never would
have thought about that in exactly the
way they presented it so I thought oh
that that would be interesting to to
sort of
see the the black version of what we're
seeing if you're not black to to see the
black interpretation of the same things
you're watching but you weren't
interpreting them that way to me that
would be an interesting movie and if
it's
funny I'm there all right so I'm going
to I'm going to be uh open-minded on
that because I think uh I'm going to
agree with Elon Musk on
this when I got
cancelled Elon Musk to his credit said
we shouldn't be canceling
humor now that he wasn't supporting
anything I said he was just saying you
know let's stop canc humor so I
appreciated that so
much that I'd like to keep that standard
so he's influencing me I I want to keep
that standard I don't want to punish
this movie because it's a lot of black
creators who are having some fun with
some you know racial standards or
assumptions I say let them have their
fun let's see how they did and if it's
funny it's funny I'll recommend it if
it's
funny so that's all I got for you
YouTube and I will talk to you tomorrow
thanks for joining the best live stream
you've ever seen today bye for
