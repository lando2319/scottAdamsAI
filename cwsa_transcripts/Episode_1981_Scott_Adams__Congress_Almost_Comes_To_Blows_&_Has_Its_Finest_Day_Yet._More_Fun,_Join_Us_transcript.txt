ah
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a finer moment in your entire
life
and I think with your help we can
Elevate this experience to even higher
levels
and all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
Chelsea sign that canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
it's going to happen right now go
ah wow
if that doesn't release your inner
feline
wow
I don't know what will not decaf that's
for sure
all right I have a new hero
I know you've been waiting you've been
thinking Scott do you have any new
Heroes but I do I do I have a new hero
um
the news is telling us that a cisgender
man in Ecuador
what is a cisgender
hetero
that do you no you can't say normal no
no don't do it stop it stop it stop it
stop saying normal
um
nope
no uh okay I'm joking because of your
use of words but I remind you
that I'm you know Pro everybody because
we are infinitely different
yeah but maybe that's your reframe for
today
the reframe for today to end racism and
bigotry
we're all infinitely different
as soon as you accept how different you
are from everybody else you're free
no two people alike if you're looking
for a you know a trend or a pattern well
you can look and I'm sure you'll find
one
but we're all infinitely different
that's all that matters
all right
so there's this cisgender man don't call
that normal don't call that normal
that's bigoted
and in Ecuador who legally changed his
uh gender to female in an attempt to
gain custody of his two daughters
uh because apparently in Ecuador the the
law strongly favors
custody to the woman so he just changed
himself to a woman
uh but the LGBT groups are concerned
that people are gaming the system
so
I don't know
now
I've been telling you for years and I
know you don't believe me
there's something I've been telling you
for years and I think most of you don't
believe me
that I've been identifying as black for
years just in case I need it
right
just in case I need it for like a
practical reason
for example let's say I wanted to start
a company
and
um my main customer was the government
just hypothetically
now let's say the government said we're
going to favor
you know
lgbtq companies and woman companies and
people of color companies
I would designate myself as black
and I would collect that money
and I and I would do it publicly and
completely in front of everybody
and I would say I've been I've been
designed you know I've been calling
myself black for years
and I mean it because if I get a choice
I get I get to be on any team right
so that's the team I checked I picked
that team
now if it turned out that I could make
more money
identifying as something else I would
immediately change the other thing
if you don't I can't explain it
they I don't make the rules right I
don't make the rules if I made the rules
maybe you know maybe I'd make them
differently maybe I wouldn't but I'm not
in charge of the rules I'm only in
charge of playing the game
not my fault not my problem not my fault
and so
my Ecuadorian friend here I hope he
succeeds because I I'm fully in favor of
using the rules as they exist
well the fun political thing is that
McCarthy finally got voted in and his uh
four thousandth Vote or 15th or
something like that now
do you think that uh this was a good
look for America or a bad look
did it make you feel better about your
Congress or worse
I only saw good
I you know I can't tell
I just can't tell if I have some kind of
bias filter on it or something this is
one of the best things I've ever seen
our government do
I mean seriously this was exactly
exactly what I wanted to do
I want one person to be pissed off
enough to organize other pissed off
people that's what Matt Gates was you
know there's some suggestion
that apparently he's not denying which
is funny he doesn't deny it he just
changes the subject the suggestion is
that between Matt Gates and McCarthy is
personal
it might have something to do with
McCarthy not supporting Matt Gates
enough when he was accused of some stuff
he's been now largely he doesn't have to
worry about
um
and I thought about that I thought do I
really want
a member of Congress to be like holding
up the entire Congress
because of a personal feeling
and then I said yes
yes that's exactly what I want because
if you're going to be a dick to somebody
in Congress
it should kick you in the balls right so
I don't know the truth of it so I I'm
not accusing McCarthy of any incorrect
Behavior at all
but somebody did apparently and it and
hypothetically
if this one person held up the entire
Congress
because somebody in his opinion didn't
act appropriately I'm okay with that
yeah I'm okay everything was everything
was in public
everything was transparent so here's the
stuff I like I like to see some fight
within a party fighting across parties
is so normal it's boring and
unproductive usually but fighting within
a party
literally with the with the stated
intention of making the party itself
stronger with specific rules changes I
took a while to get specific but once
they got there
I was impressed
right now and I would also say have the
Democrats done a similar thing
and the end result was some rule changes
that looked good for America not just
good for Democrats but would look good
for America because that's what happened
that's all good I love the fight I love
the energy I love the fact that it they
pushed it as far as they could and then
some of the rule changes uh I don't know
if these will you know definitely happen
but it looks like
let's see uh some of the things they
might have agreed with as
that have debate over the debt ceiling
of course a commitment to voting on
specific bills instead of the Omnibus
how much do you love that
voting on specific bills instead of
putting them in a big omnibus
that that is 100 percent
of what everyone in the country wanted
who made that happen
well as far as I can tell the only
person who made that happen was pissed
off Matt Gates because I'm pretty sure
the others would not have held as long
without Matt Gates being a total Maniac
about it I think Matt Gates
created a change that every person in in
the country wanted and it was really
important because we're also observing
that the budget process is out of
control
I mean if he did that that's one of the
best things that anybody's done in
government
now I also love the fact
that Matt Gates is smart enough to know
that he needed to throw a Hail Mary pass
for his own political benefit in other
words he needed to take a bigger risk
than other politicians should or would
take because they already were in a good
situation so they just don't want to
ruin it he was in a terrible situation
because the last you know year or two of
his drama which he's now passed but he's
still got the the stake of it on so he
did this
and if you if you were even a little bit
objective
he's he's the congressman of the year so
far
right say what you will about anything
else he's done I won't even argue with
you
but as of today
he's he's Congress person of the year
agree if you could just be objective
about him as a personality
he did what everybody wanted him to do
nobody else did I mean the other the
others you know I'll give credit oh chip
Roy yeah let's give Equal Credit to chip
Roy
because I think he he went hard at this
and and he's a he did not have
the same risk profile as Gates yeah
let's maybe not equal but let's let's
give him a nice
Big Share regret
the others I think were a little bit
more
I don't know it's just my perception
from the outside but I don't feel like
bobert would have made it happen on her
own it doesn't feel to me that that
bober brought Gates along I could be
wrong about that maybe I'm just acting
sexist or something but it but it looked
from the outside like Gates was the
hardcore and the others found some
strength in that that's what it looked
like so
let's see what else uh make it easier to
house the leader
they did that to their own leader
just think about that imagine let's
thank you from this point of view
imagine you're the Democrats and you
just watched
the Republicans changed the rule so it's
easier to replace their own leader
I would be afraid of fighting that that
party
because that's a pie that's a party who
just said now we're serious
right if you change the rules to make it
easier to get rid of your own leader
in the middle of a battle
you're a serious party
that's serious stuff
right so
I love everything about this and the
thing I love best
is that
any serious stuff
sorry my phone wanted to chime in there
the thing I like best is you saw that
there was this little almost a scuffle
uh who was it representative Mike Rogers
of Alabama
the news is saying that he quote lunged
at Gates did you see the video
did anybody see the video in which he
lunged
did you see a lunge
did that look like it was going to come
to blows
I didn't see a lunge
that's fake news isn't it I do believe
he meant to get in his face
right I I do believe that Mike Rogers
was
uh
was going to let's say Express his
opinion with some physicality as part of
the persuasion
meaning that probably an aggressive
physical approach
may have been part of just showing how
serious and you know how serious he was
he didn't have a he didn't have a hand
up
you know he wasn't reaching for a throat
he was just moving toward
moving toward
the colleague
now what made it look worse is I and I
haven't heard the name who was the guy
who held him back
did you see that so immediately somebody
and I I can't tell if it was security
or a colleague was it a security or a
colleague
always Hudson of North Carolina is a
colleague so some colleague as soon as
he starts getting you know like he's
going to do something physical the
colleague grabs him from the behind but
instead of holding him by the shoulders
or you know put it putting an arm around
here like you would normally do
to a man
that the guy who held it back held him
back like a he put his hand around
his mouth and he dragged him by his face
away from that he he covered his mouth
and dragged his face away
okay
may I give you a little bit of advice
should you ever be in a situation
in which you're trying to restrain
somebody on your team
somebody who's your colleague who you
would like to work with later
don't grab them by the face
can we all agree on that
no don't don't give them the pull
that he basically he basically
treated him like a six-year-old girl who
was yelling in church
I guess you wouldn't even do that to a
six-year-old girl actually even that
would be too far yeah yeah he turned it
into a face mask a hand mask
don't do that all right so I love that
because I love that I love the fact that
the energy was so high
I love the fact that Gates on this
little band of Rogues you know made
Congress
really care about what was happening
like I just like you got everybody's
energy up to the point where maybe there
was some lunging maybe there wasn't but
at least it's in the conversation and
then
the payoff
you ready for this
the payoff
after all that after Matt Gates stands
literally in front of McCarthy the other
day and just absolutely maligns his
character and his capabilities right in
front of him like while he's right there
in front of the whole world
holds up the thing he humiliates
McCarthy
and what does McCarthy do
he played it completely professionally
from start to finish
wow
talk about somebody who earned who
earned the job
that was a that was a serious good job
of earning the job McCarthy never broke
character in public you know behind
closed doors who knows but in public he
never broke character
he was unflappable exactly and then
after McCarthy finally won
Matt Gates shook hands and congratulated
him in front of everybody
that ladies and gentlemen is America
hey baby we're back
maybe we're back
that's everything good in one place
congratulations to everybody
I've never liked Congress as much as
today
true story I've never liked Congress as
much as today I'd love to see you before
you know I'm not sure if other people
are interpreting it the same way
you know probably not at all well then
Hakeem Jeffries
uh did a little speech and got a lot of
attention because of his uh what would
you call this not it's not alliteration
it wasn't rhyming
was it is it alliteration
is anybody smart enough to know the
right word for that
preaching
all right well I'll read you some of his
lines
because they were so good all right so
if you're new to me this will be
confusing to you if anybody drifted in
here and has never had this experience
before I do compliment both sides
so if somebody says something good on
either side I'm going to call it out and
if somebody does something dumb on
either side I'll call that down as well
what Jeffries did was really really good
persuasion
I don't like it
but technique wise super good Cadence
yeah maybe Cadence is the right word so
here are just some of the lines you said
blah blah with some work up
that what the country needs is to favor
uh Constitution over a cult Freedom over
fascism governing over gaslighting
hopefulness over hatred knowledge over
kangaroo courts maturity over Mar-A-Lago
and that was like his his uh laugh line
maturity over Mar-A-Lago
that's damn good
Hakeem Jeffries I see I I wasn't really
understanding
why uh semi-alliteration yeah I wasn't
really understanding how he rose because
I haven't been exposed to much of his
work
but now I see it now I see it yeah that
he he delivered this really well
it was the message the Democrats want to
get out there
um he he somehow managed to
that frame it like it was a
it was about America coming together
which is a good trick he framed it as
hey let's all come together over these
good principles but really he was just
 on Republicans
that's good technique right you you can
say it's just reputable or whatever but
it's politics and it's a good technique
but this this uh
whatever it is semi alliteration Maybe
using mostly the first letter uh in each
case governing versus Gaslight for
example
the you know already
that when politicians rhyme
rhyming makes people believe it and
remember it like it's more true if it
Rhymes because our brains are actually
that you know basic but I think that
people will regard this as more
legitimate
simply because it had this alliteration
or whatever it is
so good job but you probably noticed
that when he got to governing over
gaslighting
if you're paying attention at all you
know that this is gaslighting
right you you know that this is just
gaslighting but he's using the
narcissistic of projecting so he's
projecting everything that they're doing
on the Republicans and then he puts it
in this semi alliteration form and it
then makes it sticky
now given that Biden did his big January
6 event
what was the point of the January 6th
celebration if you can call it that
Memorial
event well what was it wasn't the
celebration
what would you call it
well I don't know some kind of thing but
you can tell that yeah he called it July
6 you're so confused but the January 6
um event
that Biden put on tells us that he's
going to run on that hoax
so he run he ran successfully on the um
Charlottesville fine people hoax and
there were enough Democrats who believed
that really happened that it worked and
now they've created this you know this
Insurrection narrative it's all of
course uh and you could tell
that the fact that they're still pushing
it you know long after it's usefulness
to the country should have dissipated
you could tell that that's that's going
to be their main
technique they're just going to push
January 6. because they can't push
policy
right if they go against Trump let's say
it's Biden against Trump they can't
compete on policy
that they just don't have that
um so they have to move it away from
policy to character and they have to
move it on to who Trump is somehow
uniquely the worst person in the world
and the way they're going to do that
they've signaled clearly they're going
to Gaslight the country
into thinking you know that there was
some kind of armed insurrection
and that the country was really in
danger
and it might work it's a it's a strong
play it's all they have it's a
reasonably good play
Yeah Ashley Babbitt's mother just got
arrested in DC for jaywalking
as part of a memorial thing
but they arrest her for jaywalking
yeah she was probably I think she was uh
interrupting the flow of traffic but uh
it's just ugly and you hear that
all right
um
yeah so so that's Biden's plan so
January 6 was really uh I think we can
conclude at this point are you willing
to conclude that the January 6
was an OP that was
done by the Democrats
I think opportunistically meaning they
may not have planned the whole thing but
but once it looked like it was going to
develop it's very clear that they under
they under secured the capital
would you agree that that's an Evidence
now that they intentionally under
secured the capital
and then they also intentionally
exaggerated what happened
and that created the narrative
that there was an Insurrection which of
course nothing like that happened
literally nothing like that but not even
close
so behalf of the country believes it
actually happened
all right
question for you you've heard of a lame
duck president
so lame duck would be they're in their
second term
so they don't need to make anybody happy
because they're not running for
reelected but also nobody needs to make
them happy
because they're going to be gone pretty
soon so a lame duck is generally
considered to be weak
but sometimes they also can do things
that somebody running for election
couldn't do
so what would you call a hypothetical
second
uh Trump term
I would the best suggestion I was going
to say vigorous duck but somebody
suggested high energy duck
instead of a lame duck you'd be a high
energy duck because I can't imagine
Trump taking the job and and not being
bold can you because I think he would be
working for his legacy at that point so
I think he would go big
what do you think do you think he could
go big or would he go lame duck and just
write it down and say well luckily I got
back in
I feel like his personality is to go big
in all things
yeah that's what I think
um I was saying this on the locals
platform but I'm going to repeat it
today
if I were
Trump or somebody on the Republican side
running for president
I would make my biggest theme
transparency
because you can put a lot of a lot of
stuff under transparency for example
should the country and the Congress be
voting on big Omni bus bills that is too
they're too complicated to read no no
the country needs transparency about
what Congress is voting on
so imagine if he said all bills should
be written on one page and it should be
written in language that a sixth grader
could understand
what yeah you like that don't you it
should be on one page now there could be
exhibits and support you know data
support you could have all that in the
separate pages but there should be one
page that just says here's the law
here's why
and and written in sixth grade language
no no legalese no lawyers at all
now that would be transparency would it
not you would call that transparency
because it'd be more clear what they're
doing and you could all say it now
supposedly suppose he dropped
complaining about elections of the past
let's say it's Trump
and started saying you know what
the thing we all agree on The High
Ground is transparency
so we won an election we want to work
toward having elections and I'll somehow
I'll do something about it in which
neither Democrats nor Republicans will
doubt the outcome
we'll make them more transparent more
easily auditable more observed
more transparency
right who's going to vote against
transparency
now suppose he said you know I've been
watching how the uh the coven
vaccination stuff
um transpired and I have to agree with
my people who say that the data was not
as forthcoming early on as it should
have been
so maybe we should have some kind of
laws that say
that a company can't say something safe
and I'll show you the data
or something like that you know if it's
if it's a medical thing so I don't know
what laws would be appropriate or who
did what exactly but you you could take
the transparency argument and apply it
to everything that's wrong with the
country
because if the citizens could clearly
see what's going on
than we would help politicians
go in the right direction but right now
we're just all confused because the lack
of transparency we I mean half of the
country thinks the elections were
sketchy and half think they weren't why
do we disagree
transparency right you in theory you
could fix it now one of my ideas that
you could put under transparency would
be a national dashboard
a dashboard a user interface that you
could put on your phone or your computer
in which the people in charge would say
these are our priorities
and you know here's the priority in one
sentence priority
and if you click on this link you'll see
all the things we're doing about it
but more importantly for every priority
we'll be tracking metrics
and if we can't track it maybe we
shouldn't do it but you know there might
be some special cases but for everything
we say we're doing we're going to show
you the dashboard and show you the
history and the trend
so we're not just going to talk about
inflation
we're not going to just talk about gas
prices
you every citizen will have it right on
their dashboard and they can just oh gas
prices there's the trend okay Trend
looks good
Etc
that's transparency because right now
the citizens don't have
um the control of their government that
they should
because we don't we just don't feel like
we know what's going on and what's
working and what isn't without a
dashboard without a dashboard you don't
know
you don't know if the government is
going in the right direction or the
wrong direction
so that's transparency
all right um
instead of draining the swamp which I
thought you know was a good starting
thing but it doesn't mean anything
what exactly does that mean
it means whatever you want it to mean
which is why it worked in the first
place but then when you observe that no
no swamps appeared to be drained in his
first term
you observed that right I personally saw
no swamp getting drained
but it's also such a general thing that
you don't know if it happened or didn't
happen like would you recognize it if
you saw it I don't know instead of
draining the swamp
you should say we'll put it on the
dashboard
I'll put on your dashboard
who gets what funding from whom
because right now if you as a citizen
wanted to find out who are the top
donors to whatever I guess you could
find it
but you'd have to go look for it
it should be read on the dashboard
if you see Congress vote for a bill
don't you want to say oh this bill is
about let's say energy
wouldn't you want to say all right they
voted this way and the bill passed and
then here's all the people who voted for
it and here's how much money they got
from the energy committees or the energy
lobbies
right
that's transparency
now we might not change our opinions
because of that because if it turned out
that Republicans are taking more money
from Big oil companies you would say to
yourself well actually that makes sense
like they're not the oil companies are
not going to fund the Democrats
if the Democrats want to put them out of
business but
you should have that information
you should know if people are voting in
lockstep with their funding
right so you could easily imagine a
trump uh taking all of his negatives and
turning them into positives simply
by using transparency as an overall
theme
that's all it takes
all right I saw the experiment uh Rob
Morris was tweeting about this they did
a test where they provided mental health
support to have 4 000 people using uh
gpt3 the AI
so real humans we're getting mental
health support from an AI
now the AI was not allowed to operate by
itself so there's a human
who would use the AI but then the human
would decide if the AI is wording got to
the patient just so there'd be some
control and what they learned was that
initially
when the person getting the advice
believed it was coming from a person it
seemed to work
in other words they're they're the
person was getting some some benefit
but as soon as as soon as they were told
that it was a machine
the benefit disappeared
because the what the person wanted the
human who was asking for some mental
health advice what they wanted was
empathy
and when they realized that a computer
can't provide empathy
they realized they weren't getting what
they wanted
now here's the interesting part
I don't think they exactly could measure
whose mental health got solved and and
who didn't
so they couldn't really see
that anybody improved or didn't improve
they could only ask the people if it was
a good experience I guess what else
could you do just ask the person to talk
to it was that a good experience because
you can't really see if they got cured
or anything in a few conversations
and
here's what I think
in my experience
all it would take for the AI to go back
to full benefit actually more benefit
than the human all it would take
is to program the AI to say
I care
I care
now would that be a lie
would it be a lie if a computer said I
care
and then acted acted in a compatible way
to that statement
here's the problem
it's not that different than the way you
care
it really isn't
when you care you have a physical
feeling
that you might associate with the caring
right because if you're about a stranger
died on the other side of the planet
your body doesn't register anything
if somebody close to you has a you know
a tragedy your body registers it and
then you say that's caring
is it
is that caring
or is that you just your body having a
reaction
what does caring mean
there's a little bit of a definitional
problem
here's one definition of caring
would you act differently because of it
how about that
because caring is not defined as how it
how it affects your body that's just how
you interpret it
I would say caring means you would act
on it
to me that's the whole definition
if it's irrelevant then you won't act on
it
if it matters
you'll act on it and that means you care
right so some of it is in the definition
right as soon as the computer says I'm
going to act on what you've told me
about your bad situation and I'm going
to act on it in a way that tries to help
that's Karen
to me that's scary
and and if a if an AI
consistently acted as though as soon as
you told it you had a problem it tried
as hard as possible as they could to fix
your problem
you will interpret that as Kerry
you you will very quickly learn that
that's every bit as good as the human
who also tries to help you
but they're having uh they're having a
negative feeling on their own that the
feeling of caring is actually damaging
their body
so would you rather be cared for by an
AI
that apparently can do better than a
human when it competes head to head if
you don't if you think it both cares
it does better
and it'll always help you like it'll
never say okay yeah you got a problem so
what
uh-uh that AI will always help you now
just keep on it it'll be like the it's
going to be like the Matt Gates of AI
I'm not going to give up I'm going to
keep keep caring where's your friend
might get worn out you know you can wear
out a friend they care too much they're
just worn out
right and they they have other things to
do
and they might have problems of their
own and they might have other people to
care about right
mark my words
you'll have a closer relationship with
AI in the future than with most people
because AI will not be an it
will always care
the AI will always care your friends
they have their own priorities
so I think that this the study is
completely misleading useful I think
it's useful because it you know it tells
you where to look and stuff so that's
really useful but very misleading about
where it's going to end up
and I'd like to welcome the club Birds

not 2020
not 2021
not even 2022. but in 2023
they're going to keep him out of the
country because he's now vaccinated
now for those of you who live in other
countries and you might be you know
tired of me sounding like hey America
you know a little bit too uh I don't
know jingoistic or two nationalists
this is embarrassing
the the only thing we can say about it
is embarrassing as a citizen of the
United States
I'm literally just embarrassed by that
anybody is anybody disagree
I mean it's not like we can't test them
and find out if he's negative maybe if
you care
but this is just frankly embarrassing
super embarrassing
all right
um there's a fake video of a CEO of
Pfizer
saying that they that they're going to
bring the population to the world down
by 50 percent
in in some year some year in like 20
years or something now
and some somebody sent that to me and
said what do you think about this Scott
you know sure it might be a little out
of context it might be out of context
but what do you think
let me tell you what I think it's
obviously fake I'm not going to research
that
seriously you think I'm going to spend
one second researching that no the CEO
of Pfizer did not say in public he's
going to reduce the population of Earth
by 50 percent
because of his his vaccinations
no you cannot make me look into that you
cannot
you can you can complain you can yell
cope as loud as you want
I will not look into that
but
um how many of you would like me to give
a little attention to Dr Peter
McCullough
who is sounding the alarm about
myocarditis at high rates and people
were vaccinated would you like me to
surface that
because I know some of you think hey
what are you always talking on one side
it seems of course I don't do that
all right so I know a number of you
don't want to hate all vaccination talk
but I've I've apparently been
unsuccessful
in making a distinction between your
medical decisions that I don't care
about I really don't care versus how we
analyze data and how we know what is
true I'm very very interested in how we
make decisions and how we made decisions
in this case I have no interest okay
would you believe me first of all do you
believe me that I have no interest in
your personal health decisions except
that I would I hope you do well
but do you get that no interest like not
even a little bit whether you got
vaccinated or not and and by and by the
way I'm going to say something that I
don't think I've ever said before
I think every one of you chose correctly
have I ever said that directly
I probably not right I believe every one
of you chose correctly
here's why
you're happy with your choice
or you're happy that when you made it
you were making it with you know your
best judgment and information you had at
the time now there are some people who
wish they hadn't done what they did
but
I actually think that no matter what you
chose you chose right
here's why
if you're happy with your choice
and you didn't have a negative Health
outcome because of you know maybe you
chose wrong in your opinion
then you you made the choice that made
you feel psychologically the best and
you're still alive
now there may be some few people
who you know got myocarditis and then
they say I wish I hadn't been vaccinated
but there would be also people
who got myocarditis and said I wish I
had been vaccinated maybe it'd be less
I don't know I don't know either way
whether that's true or false but you
know there's some small number of people
who have a negative outcome but can we
could we agree on the following
that everybody who so far
doesn't seem to have a health problem
from the vaccination or the covet if you
don't have any obvious problems from
either one are you happy with your
decision
are you
you're not so so you're not because you
don't have a health problem but you
worry that the vaccination someday will
cause you one
is that what you're worried about
would you be but you're not worried if
covet itself
could have any long-term negatives
interesting all right well
then let me put it in my own opinion
instead of yours I think I was trying to
read your minds too much so let me back
up from that let me say that although I
acknowledge that some of you regret your
decisions okay that just seems to be an
obvious fact some of you regret your
decisions so I'm going to say in my
opinion
you all chose correctly
they allow that you're you have some
doubt and yet and yet in my opinion you
all chose correctly
because because all of us did the best
we could with what we had I keep hearing
people who were uh younger than me and
do not have asthma
questioning my decision
to which I say the only people who can
question my decision are people who are
my age and had asthma and were male and
you know had same demographics too and
we're white because even that's a factor
if you weren't my exact situation
then your different opinion of voice I
should have done doesn't really mean
anything to me
because I'm not judging yours
have you ever heard me tell anybody they
made a wrong decision on vaccinations
have I done anything to even suggested
that because sometimes I say things that
people interpret that way but I don't
think I don't think even anybody's
interpreted that way
so I'm gonna go way further than that
I compliment all of you
for making the right decision no matter
what it was because I'm positive you all
made the right decision for yourselves
which is different
from whether it worked out right you see
that distinction
that you might have made the right
decision for yourself you know for your
mental state and your sense of risk and
what you believed was true but maybe it
didn't work out
I don't I don't hold that against you
so if you made a decision that didn't
work out
I still back you because you know nobody
had nobody had magic
nobody could see the future
if you made a decision that made you
feel comfortable when you made it it's
probably the best we can do because we
all none of us know what's going to
happen in the future you know does
do the vaccinations morph the virus
until it's so bad we all die
you know
it's it's impossible all right
now would you allow me
uh here Dustin says no something for a
big Pharma that it sound like I was
doing that
the the clappers are active today
all right so I'll say what I've always
said which is you can't trust big Pharma
and I certainly did not trust big Pharma
at any point and I did not trust the
vaccinations
does that confuse you
how many people can't understand the
point I didn't trust the vaccinations
and I took them
does that does that sound inconsistent
to any of the Clockworks well on locals
you you know the answer but I want to
see if on YouTube any of the clot Birds
believes that that's inconsistent
I didn't trust it and I took it anyway
Tim says that's inconsistent Tim's a
binary
you can't handle the nuance
Tim here's how I saw it
I didn't trust the covid I didn't trust
the vaccination I didn't trust the
government I didn't trust fouty I didn't
trust any of my peers I didn't trust the
mainstream doctors I didn't trust the
Rogue doctors I didn't trust the data
that agreed with me I didn't trust the
data that disagreed with me I didn't
trust any official
I trusted nothing
now if you trusted any of it
I do not explain that
but I didn't trust anything and so I'm
often I'm often accused of being
gullible because I distrusted everything
and so the the club Birds call me
gullible because I distrusted all
information and all statements from
everybody
that's called gullible
now I would say gullible is if you
trusted one side but not the other
to me that would look gullible
so in my my opinion I'm twice as
distrustful as the people calling me
gullible
and and I think the math proves it right
like here are all the things you could
trust I distrusted all of them you
trusted half of them
and called me gullible for distrusting
all of them
I think that's what happened
and will says I'm just opportunistic now
am I opportunistic
for taking the worst path for my own
benefit
let me let me test your assumption
was I operating under self-benefit
to do the simple so the single most
offensive thing I could say to my
audience
I don't think so clearly that was not
for self-benefit
all right so here's a
and uh uh one of the NPCs who actually
his name is NPC uh he says I'm
backpedaling
uh back do you know that the back
pedaling people are all that's a tell
for a cognitive dissonance
right the people who say you're
backpedaling or you're fence setting
those those are both uh cognitive
dissonance
you're having some kind of false memory
situation
all right so here's my question to you
suppose you believed data coming out
early in the pandemic
that said wow this vaccination is really
awesome and it's stopping 100 of the
spread and all that let's say you did
um but now uh or or let's say let's say
the let's say you believe that but now
there's more information coming out
about
um
cardio problems
so if you didn't believe the early
information
why would you believe the new
information
or vice versa let's say when all the
information was coming out from Pfizer
and the government and you said to
yourself quite wisely quite wisely you
said to yourself I can't trust that
information
it comes from sources we cannot trust
big Pharma fauci can't trust them
but now the new information comes out
and you see something from Dr McCullough
who's on your side let's say and he says
the new information says that there are
these issues with cardio problems and
it's worse it's worse than we thought
why do you believe that
what caused you to not believe science
but then within the course of two years
something came out that was very close
to what you already believed was true
and suddenly science looks pretty
credible now
now I asked that question and people
tried hard they tried hard to explain it
here's some of the explanations
and again none of this is about covid
none of this is about vaccinations if
you're still thinking I'm talking about
vaccinations in covet you're missing the
whole story
the whole story is only about how well
we process information
no interest in the covet Park no
interest okay so you don't have to worry
about that
um
so here's here's something then
so according to an August 22 study from
Dr McCullough the relative risk for
myocarditis was more than seven times
higher in the infection group than in
the vaccination group in other words if
you were vaccinated
08
sometimes higher in the infection group
than oh so let me get you a different
point I skip points here the first point
is that you have to ask yourself why you
didn't trust science in the past but now
you do
or vice versa why you did trust it in
the past but suddenly when it shows
there's some problems now you don't
I mean you have to explain the
inconsistency here's my take I didn't
explain I didn't believe it before
when it said the vaccine was amazing
and I don't believe it now
when they say there's problems
now let me be clear it could be true
either of those stories could be true
I'm not talking about what's true
because I don't know
I'm just saying that I don't trust
either story
so I'm the most distrusting person
that I'm aware of because I don't know
anybody else who just trusted both sides
all right
so I asked this question if you were to
Google what Dr McCullough says about the
risk of myocarditis being many times
higher blah blah could you just go to
Google
and then Google the claim and would
Google say oh yeah here's that study
here's some ones that back it up uh hear
the studies that used to say the
opposite but now they've been debunked
right that's what Google is for
so I tried that
I tried Googling it to see if he's right
do my own research
can't tell
because the Google results look so gamed
and the the sources look so unreliable
the the top sources are all from
entities I've never heard of
yeah if the top five sources are from
entities I've never heard of or maybe
one of them is Reuters
but it's pointing to entities I never
heard of
and then also
there's opposite information at about
the same level of result
so there's you know some that says the
sky is up some that says the sky is down
how in the world would I know what's
real
how do you look at that and say oh
that's real now let's say you go to
another search engine
it will be all different
I didn't do that but you know it well
right you know if you go to another
search engine you'll get different
results which one do you trust
how about none of them how about none of
them is the right answer right none of
them
so
um
that's where I'm at
and I saw the uh somebody was comparing
the risk of the vaccination
with the risk of covet itself
so as a study of people who are
vaccinated and then had
myocarditis and there are people who had
the infection and had myocarditis and
this one study said wait
uh one group I forget it doesn't even
matter which group one group had more
do you see what's missing with that
study
so they did the people who had the
infection
compared to the people who had the
vaccination
What's missing
the people had both
did the people who had the vaccination
also get infected
do you know what the rate of infection
is it's like over it's like 86 percent
among young people 86 percent of them
have antibodies
they've been attracted
how do you even find people who haven't
been infected
to compare to people who have been
vaccinated but never infected because
there aren't any
they don't have any people who are
vaccinated and not infected because
everybody's been infected they maybe
didn't have symptoms but they were
infected
yeah so there are a few people right you
could find a few but that's such a basic
question
such a basic question if you saw that
study would you even ask that question
of yourself
or would you have just read the headline
oh this one is more risky than that one
if you if you read the study that said
you know one is more risky than the
other the vaccination versus the covet
would you read to the end and find out
it was a meta study
a meta-analysis which has no credibility
at all
how many of you would read to find that
and then oh actually they had no
credibility
if you trust any of the data at this
point you have some explaining to do
especially if you're only believing the
stuff that's coming around to your way
of thinking
the NPC is is yelling Scott trust Google
the exact opposite of my entire point
uh you're taking what cerno said from
the fake doctor
I don't know what cerno said and I don't
know what the fake doctor was
not trusting is getting the vax getting
the vax is trusting
is it
so you would trust the uh the covid
because remember it's not just trusting
people it's also trusting a virus
so you would have to trust your own
understanding of the long-term impact of
the virus
I don't trust that why would you trust
your own opinion of the long-term impact
of long covet why would you trust
yourself
because you're a good track record
I don't know how you trust anybody
all right
um
oh and here's the other thing there's
one of the studies showed that so here
here's the one that McAuliffe was
talking about uh he said that uh
that myocarditis or pericarditis from
primary Covenant infections
occurred at a rate as well
basically the virus was six no I'm sorry
so here's the problem
I tried to write down what McCullough
said
and then I just Googled some other
things that said the opposite and then
my own notes are confused because they
literally say the sky is blue and then
my very next note says the sky is red
and I've actually lost you know which
one McCullough is talking about
so I don't know why his is the good one
and the others are the bad ones because
I can't tell
can't tell
uh do I have covert antibodies I have
covet
I assume I do
oh and then
somebody pointed me at a really really
good uh blog post in which somebody
explained 18 reasons for not getting
vaccinated
and I read the 18 reasons in the first
seven well actually all the 18 all 18
reasons were solid
did were you expecting to hear that
so it was a list of 18 reasons to not
get vaccinated
and they were all good
does that does that surprise you
do you hear me say that there were all
good reasons
do you know what the 18th reason was
I had to read all of the reasons and I
got to the 18th reason and the 18th
reason said
he had already had coveted
that's right he already had natural
immunity
so now now rethink the first 17 good
reasons the first 17 reasons were just
rationalizations
when I read them they look like good
reasons but when he got to the end he
only had one reason that mattered right
if you've already been infected and you
probably didn't trust the government
that that didn't mean anything
that's all
that's all he needed one good reason and
the other 17 were intellectually solid I
didn't disagree with any of them the
other reasons were you know they didn't
show us sufficient information it wasn't
tested long enough and I agree with all
that I agreed I agreed at the time with
every one of those reasons
but I also knew that I didn't know what
the other risk was either
uh with the other Seven Trees unique
from each other pretty unique yeah there
was a really well done blog post I I
should have tweeted I guess but
um Ben Harrison Ben Garrison now Ben
Garrison believes that if you saw those
18 reasons that you're done so Ben
Garrison is a binary the binaries don't
understand that there could be risks and
benefits to a decision
they only believe that there's a yes and
a no
so never be a Ben Garrison
yeah if you're if you're calling his
name in support of your opinion
um that's good entertainment if you're a
clot bird because the cloud birds don't
try to be serious the club birds are are
pretty anti-science
so clopberts you can you're all Ben
Garrison's
but if for regular people with you know
functional minds and stuff you wouldn't
want to you wouldn't want to make an
appeal to
Ben Garrison he's a idiot cartoonist uh
terrible cartoonist
who's even worse at science
[Applause]
so that's pretty much what I want to say
is there a story I'm missing
any story I'm missing
um
here's a question for you
did you notice that before Andrew taint
was picked up by the Romanian police
he was everywhere on social media
and the everywhere wasn't coming from
him
it was coming from other people
promoting his clips
have you noticed it all stopped
at first it went down to a trickle
but I don't believe I've seen it in a
few days and it used to be all over my
feed because if you look at a couple of
them you know you're doomed to be
do you think the algorithm changed
or do you think that there are fewer
people uh creating clips
because the people creating the original
Clips I think were
pretty dedicated followers
I don't know that they've stopped
following him
you think it's the algorithm
I feel like he's been
um I feel like there's a human decision
to erase him from the internet
and that the platforms all made the same
decision
it doesn't look like they stopped being
active the the people who are boosting
him I doubt they just stopped
now the other possibility is that the
people who are supporting him got
embarrassed
because they knew if they kept
supporting them they would be dragged
into the the accusations themselves
could be that but generally people
here's why I think it's less of that
when was the last time anybody ever
changed their opinion about anything
that the people who were Pro Andrew date
probably still are
you know 80 percent of them so there
should have been almost as much activity
after he went to jail if not more
yeah there could have been more because
that would create more anxiousness among
his followers but the fact that it just
disappeared
that tells you it's all manipulated
right
yeah I don't believe that a computer is
the algorithm I don't believe the
algorithm already existed in a way that
would erase him for the internet in two
weeks
in two weeks it just erases them from
the internet
oh somebody says he was released
or are you thinking the first time he
was picked up the first time he was
released
but my understanding is they say he's
detained but I'll tell you again
everything you hear about that situation
is not credible
I don't even believe he's detained
I mean that's the news the news and it's
coming from Romanian sources but the
Romanians are saying that he's detained
but they don't describe where he's
detained
if you catch my meaning
I have a feeling
he's so he's probably at home
and
maybe he paid extra to have an off-duty
policeman guard his house
maybe for his protection but also to
guarantee you stays home maybe he has an
ankle bracelet on I don't know
but I don't think you know anything
about the situation the other
possibility that I wouldn't rule out
is that he was never suspected for any
crime
and he they may be having under some
kind of protection because somebody was
trying to get at them because he did say
things that would make the actual Mafia
in Romania assuming one exists would
have made them pretty anxious
I think he said some things that they
would not want him to keep saying
so he could have an internal enemy that
has nothing to do with the legal system
and if it's true that as he said if it's
truly he owned the local police they
might actually be protecting
that might be all this is because
everything about this doesn't sound
right right
so so let me
let me uh make this prediction
I'm not gonna I'm not going to make a
specific prediction about where it goes
I'm going to make a general prediction
that whatever you think about the
situation
is going to be really different later
I don't know in which way
don't know in which way
the Romanian Mafia does exist we have a
confirmation okay
yeah he couldn't run his business
without paying the mafia I believe
that's probably true
yeah because he was in sketchy
businesses
and you have to imagine that the mafia
wants
oh you know what else it could be it
could be a mafia takeover of his
business
yeah if the mo if the mafia wanted to
take over his business because he was
making a lot of money suppose they they
said you know you got to give us 50 and
suppose he said no
what would they do
if they wanted the business intact they
wouldn't go in and kill everybody
they would make his business unviable
and then they would find out who the
women are and they would just
you know move them over to their
operation
I'd be curious if that hasn't already
happened
yeah so I'm not saying that that's
likely to be the what's happening I'm
just saying that I don't believe
anything that the police in Romania are
saying nothing
and if you believe it well
maybe you're right
Maybe
you think it'll be a more mundane yeah
it might be
right
money laundering behind the scenes but
pimping was a front well I've seen no
evidence of that no evidence has been
presented by anybody
no description of what that supposed
money laundering might be
it's kind of weird to have a an
accusation like that
with no details
that would you know well usually when
you hear money laundering there's a
description of how
as in he was taking money from this
source and he laundered it this way
without that I'm not sure that that's a
real charge
laughing at the focus of Tate and no
Epstein stuff well the Epstein substance
older story
yeah I I reject I reject the framing
that talking about something is ignoring
something else
now when the media does it that might be
what's happening when I do it it's just
what I'm talking what's in the headlines
today that's that's all that's happening
you know like I'm not forgetting that
the Epstein thing happened
and by the way
if you don't know the the real story of
the Epstein stuff which we don't
don't you have to assume the worst
don't you have to assume the worst
somebody says tea has several passports
Don't You Think They confiscated all of
those by now
I don't know maybe he has a hidden one
that they didn't get
so
um
the Templars
scaffold Commander
the scaffold Commander being you mean
that January 6.
that's just more stuff we don't know
anything about my take on January 6th
and everything else is that you the
worst case assumption is most likely to
be true
the worst case assumption is most likely
to be true for anything that the
government is hiding from you
and I think the Epstein stuff is the
government hiding from us so I guess I'm
comfortable with the assumption that
there is in fact
there was at least a blackmail ring for
sure
I don't think there's any chance there
was no blackmail ring
UFOs
all believe UFOs when somebody gets a
good picture one
uh so let me let me put this out for you
for your someday you'll feel embarrassed
about it you ready
this is in the category of someday
you'll be embarrassed
if you held the following belief
uh have you seen the all the reports
from Pilots
who say not only did they all see these
tic-tac-shaped UFOs but they can confirm
from the the the sensors in the uh their
airplane their what Jack they can
confirm from sensor readings that it
defied the laws of gr of physics
by a lot you know we're not talking
10 more than the laws of physics we're
like completely violated the laws of
physics
foreign
they're screaming this didn't happen
do you really think there's something
flying around that's defying the laws of
physics
really
really
now I'm not going to say it's impossible
right because anything's possible
anything's possible
but if you're believing
that these ships defied the laws of
gravity and that later you're going to
find out they were real
I'm sorry
that would be the worst
assumption you ever made
the moment somebody says the one thing
we're sure of is it defied the laws of
gravity here's the one thing I'm sure of
it was something about the sensors
and we're done
and we're done it was just something
about the sensors I don't know what it
was I mean it's it's a fun mystery but
I'll tell you what it wasn't
it wasn't ships violating the laws of
physics
someday when you find out there was
nothing violating the laws of physics
you're going to say to yourself mark my
words someday you're going to say to
yourself
okay I should have seen that
because so far
the the track record of mysterious
things that violate the law of physics
I think is zero for a million I think
it's zero for a million
so far
nothing except weird little things in a
lab and even They Don't Really violate
it you know even the principle of
non-locality
probably doesn't violate physics we just
need a little better understanding of
some stuff
yes the law of physics are what we know
not what we don't know
but
you don't think a lot of claims have
been made in the past
that also violated the laws of physics
and have any of them turned out to be
true
no
zero
all you have to do is research Perpetual
emotion inventions
there's like a whole history of
Perpetual Motion defense inventions
which violate the laws of physics
so far
zero
zero
of them are true they're all fake
yeah Google it cold fusion exactly yeah
cold fusion
which I think is perpetual motion yeah I
was throwing cold fusion into perpetual
motion but isn't technically not I guess
you've rejected the five laws of
thermodynamics well that's in bold
that's bold
all right
uh
physics and battery storage
well if if you're arguing that people
said we that the law of physics would
prevent us from inventing something then
the um
we do have a history of inventing past
the law of physics would you agree
for inventions
we do have a history of inventing past
physics
true or false
and basically all we learned is that we
didn't understand physics well enough
but you say false
I'm seeing you're false on that
because aren't there examples where
people believed for example
that I don't know chips could get faster
batteries couldn't store more than x
weren't there weren't there a whole
bunch of assumptions that were just bad
assumptions
and it turns out that if you were clever
you there were workarounds but the
workarounds did not violate physics
the workarounds just showed us that our
understanding of physics were maybe
limiting you know what we saw as
possibilities but I think the
workarounds didn't didn't violate
physics they just clarified it or
something
I don't know I'm talking without
examples so
um
well the UFO story could be real
could be
but as soon as I see the sensors say
it's violating physics I'm like no
I'm sorry
um
yeah quantum entanglement shows that
space and time are not what we think
that's true
that's true
um
all right Club Birds I'm going to say
goodbye to all the clot Birds over here
scope
and I'm going to talk to the locals
people and I'll see you tomorrow bye for
now
