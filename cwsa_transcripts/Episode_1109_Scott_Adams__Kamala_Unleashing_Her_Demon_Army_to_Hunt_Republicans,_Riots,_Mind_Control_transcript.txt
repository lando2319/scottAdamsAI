turn off your phones everybody
turn off your ringers because it's time
for
coffee with scott adams the best part of
the day would you want that to be
interrupted
no no you wouldn't
i understand that some people fast
forward past this part
do you know what you're missing you're
missing a cleverly engineered
moment that is designed specifically to
boost
your oxytocin your serotonin your
you name it dopamine all that stuff and
all you need
all you need is a copper mugler glass
attacker and chalice
tanker jealous just starting a canteen
sugar flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
of the day the thing
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
ah yes
i can feel things coming around
well it appears that kamala harris has
summoned her
demon army from the bowels of hell
some kind of a portal from hell opened
up in kenosha
i think there are other portals one in
chicago
one in seattle and a lot of the people
coming through the portal from hell
they look human-ish
but if you've seen the shots
not exactly human but
similar you know they they wear clothes
got that in common two legs two arms
most of them
not all of them but uh
yeah the demon army seems to be causing
a lot of trouble
i remember when people laughed when i
said that the biden
and kamala harris campaign might be
satan inspired and i said
you know it's not real i don't even
believe in satan
but look at all the coincidences i feel
as if
every single day there's another
coincidence that makes me shake my head
and say what kind of a world are we that
we
will believe anything we can talk
ourselves into
absolutely anything so we'll see what
happens with that
so some uh good news
uh representative ken buck of republican
colorado
has joined with uh i guess rand paul
in calling for investigation of the
funding
yes i said the funding of these various
protesters
and i don't know if they're going to
find something
suspicious but i would assume so
because of i think over out of state
people were arrested in kenosha
who traveled they managed to get
gasoline and they bought gas masks they
can't be that cheap and
they had supplies and fireworks and they
had
molotov cocktails and guns there were a
lot of guns
that were confiscated from people who
were arrested in kenosha
a lot of guns so these are people who
could afford to travel on a state
bring stuff with them they're getting
funding from somewhere
and wouldn't it be good to know where
that is wouldn't you like to know if
that's coming from a
foreign or domestic source or both
i'll bet you would now let me start off
by
calming your nerves every now and then i
am reminded
that what i can do for you that is of
greatest service
is to talk you out of believing the
hysteria that the fake news
whips up now i myself have predicted
that republicans would be hunted if
biden wins
and unfortunately although biden has not
won
so we we can't really say that i'm
correct in that prediction
we can say that now everybody agrees
that it looks like that so anybody who's
seen what's happened recently
would certainly agree with the
proposition that
trump report uh trump supporters have
been targeted for violence
and there's nothing there's nothing in
the air that would change that
so why would there be less of it in the
future if there's nothing really that
would
that's popping up that would be an
obstacle to that
so we don't know if i'm right about that
i'll talk more about that
in a little way a little while but let
me uh
let me put this calming thought into
your head
when people talk about a civil war and
the fabric of society being
ripped apart and all that we're nowhere
near that
we are not we're not in the general zip
code
of a civil war not in a real one you
know where people take up arms and
you know they protect territory and you
know the the government falls apart and
all that
we are nowhere near that not only are we
nowhere near it
we're not really approaching it either
we're not moving toward it
the things that you would need to have
in place for that to happen
you'd have to have number one a leader
on one of the teams so there's obviously
a leader of the established
united states but who's the leader of
the rebel army
if you don't have if you don't have a
fidel castro
you don't have a mao if you don't have
somebody who's a
very effective charismatic leader
you don't really get a civil war
somebody's gonna have to step up to be a
leader
and it's obvious that nobody has those
chops
no pun intended so that would be one
thing that's not the only thing
you could imagine that one would form
later so you might say to yourself
scott they do have leaders they'll just
emerge later
but you would have seen it by now if
those leaders had some kind of charisma
that was
you know going to transmit to a wide
group of people
the other thing you would look for uh
is far more uh willingness i guess
in the general population if you took
the total number of people who are
you know want to get violent the
anti-fos the black lives matter
protesters who are not the
well-intentioned ones
uh always like to separate there are
clearly good people with good intentions
in just about any organization that's
just always true left or right
and uh not everyone but you know what i
mean
there's a good general rule um
so somebody says aoc aoc doesn't want a
violent revolution
if if you have such a good job as aoc
does which is
i would argue that she's got a shot at
the presidency
not right away but she's got lots of
time if you have
a legitimate shot to become president of
the united states
do you start an armed conflict with
yourself at the lead
not really the first thing you do is
just see if you could do it the easy way
just see if you can get elected nobody
dies
so we don't really have a you know in
leadership we don't have a
body of people what we have is a whole
series of coincidences
which were bad coincidences sort of a
perfect storm
and i would argue that if you didn't
have these
exact uh perfectly provocative videos
of the police shootings if they weren't
on video
and they weren't this certain type of
video that shows
some of it but not all of it you know it
could be a little misleading
if you didn't have that exact situation
you wouldn't have the same triggers
if you didn't have the coronavirus you
wouldn't have all this pent-up energy
you wouldn't have
people so available they wouldn't be so
angry they wouldn't need some recreation
they'd be watching sports or traveling
or doing something else
and and even the masks as i've said
causes people temporarily to be more
bold than they would
if they didn't wear masks masks make you
bolder it's just obvious
and and of course it's an election year
so once the election is over i would
expect that the violin part
would immediately transfer into what i
call
coutu now coup two
is the the democrat uh operatives
plan which is very clear now um if you
think this is some weird conspiracy
theory thing you haven't been paying
attention because they've
they've laid it out in public so very
publicly they've said
no matter what trump does that they're
going to call the election illegitimate
now i suppose if they won outright then
they'd just be happy
but it doesn't look like it's shaping up
that way and i think they know it
it looks like trump is going to win by a
pretty healthy margin
which could be historic but it's at
least going to be a healthy margin
it looks like at this point anything
could change
so the coutu is where the political
class will use primarily
brainwashing techniques which they've
used so far
and their control of the media et cetera
to create a situation where there's some
kind of a
peaceful overthrow of the government no
shots fired
now can they pull that off well they
almost pulled off an impeachment
i mean the senate stopped it cold but
they got halfway there
with an impeachment they they tried with
russian collusion
got pretty close and now they've
signaled
that they're that they're going to
question the outcome of the election
which is obvious because they've created
a
a preference for mail-in voting
you may have seen an article i just
forwarded around where someone whose
job it was to rig mail in voting told
you how he did it and how easy it was
and how easy it would be in the new
situation
and still republi democrats say
it's perfectly safe even when the guy
who riggs them
and has rigged them and tells you
exactly how to do it and how easy it is
even when he explains it democrats will
look at you and say
that doesn't happen it just is weird
you know two movies on one screen
situation
so certainly they're setting up a
situation where at least the democrats
won't believe
that the result is believable if their
team loses
and they're softening us up with
military-grade
psychological operations i'll talk more
about that in a minute
to make you think that maybe the
military should remove a president
if the democrats say collectively that
there's something going on here
so it's pretty clear that they're
setting up the machinery to remove
president trump if he wins we'll see if
that's
successful but that would be a
non-violent kind of attempt
which i think would also fail it'd be
it's it's just a little bit too
transparent
i mean everybody could see it so it
wouldn't be any kind of a weird surprise
or anything
so that's where we are but in terms of
an armed conflict there is so much
firepower literally firepower in the
suburbs
that as soon as the protesters leave
their
their little defined spaces and they go
into any kind of a
wider geography
it's gonna there will be bloodshed
but it won't be some massive civil war
so don't worry about a civil war we're
not we're not on the same planet as
anything like that happening
it seems like that because the news has
wound us all up social media winds us
all up when we see the videos of the
tragedies and the writing
you're seeing this little keyhole of
what's going on
now that little keyhole is the same
reason as cnn
can shamelessly claim that these
demonstrations don't have any
riot characteristics to them even when
something's burning behind them
which they're actually doing if you saw
that chris
was a chris eliza of cnn he had an
article
basically suggesting that it's crazy to
think there's any rioting going on
and then the photo accompanying it was
over riots
and i thought even matt tybee
pointed it out and he's he's no trump uh
lover
and he even he pointed out that he
thought cnn was going for some
kind of a guinness book of world records
for headlines that don't match the story
or the photo which once you see it you
can't stop seeing it they've been doing
it all week
the headline doesn't have anything to do
with the photo or the story
and somehow they're okay with that it
doesn't seem to matter
all right uh so maybe we'll get to the
bottom of who's funding these guys
and i think there might be some
surprises there
might be
ted wheeler uh made a statement i think
it was yesterday
in which he uh talked about
all the violence being trump's fault
and here's what he left out or actually
should i say this is what cnn left out
when they showed the video of ted
wheeler talking
what did cnn leave out they decided to
clip
out the part where he gave his reasons
ted willer the governor i'm sorry the
mayor of
portland right gave his reasons for why
he thinks everything's trump's fault
and those reasons were i think five
cnn hoaxes you know it was like five
things that just
literally didn't ever happen except in
the minds
of people who watch cnn and msnbc
and so they think it happened i thought
did they do that intentionally
did they did they cut into the story
that the only reason he's acting the way
he is
and therefore therefore the actual riots
in his city
are literally because of five cnn hoaxes
he said that he said that directly
that there were five cnn hoaxes you i
don't even have to name them all you
know them all
but uh that was driving his
his behavior and his decisions about
what to do in his city
think about that the mayor is just
saying right there
that cnn is the cause of of the trouble
so cnn cuts that part out
i don't know if they thought of it that
way or they were just saving space in
their
on their segment but they got rid of
that part i noticed
um i you know i think what this country
needs is some kind of a common enemy
so that you know all the citizens can
band together and
have some common enemy that we can rally
around and it's starting to look like uh
ted wheeler is that common enemy because
as he was speaking
antifa was occupying his the lobby of
his apartment
so antifa is moving against the mayor
while the mayor is complaining that
trump
it's trump's fault uh
but the reason is five hoaxes the cnn
has been spreading and apparently
this idiot believes them all right
so there are a whole bunch of people
arrested
uh kenosha had 175 are arrested
175 were arrested how many people were
demonstrating
again you don't know do you watch how
often
you don't see reporting on how many
people are protesting
anywhere how many counter protesters
there are
anywhere you just don't see it
and i i speculate that the reason you
don't see the numbers is if you did
it would be easier to fix right
if you see this what looks to be a
massive number of people
you say to yourself i don't know if
there's any way to fix that
even law enforcement would have a tough
time with a crowd that big
but what if it's not that big because
apparently the
trump counter protesters if you want to
call them that
the the pro blue lives matter people
apparently they had 650 vehicles
let's say 303 people in each vehicle
did they have that many people what is
three times uh 650 uh
nearly 2 000 people did they
were there nearly 2 000 people on the
other side
i don't know and when they were how many
how many protesters were there
because if if the trump people outnumber
them let's say
five to one doesn't that tell you that
the trump
anti-anti-protest people if you want to
call them that
could stop this anytime they wanted to
they would just have to get out of their
trucks you know most of those trucks
didn't go through the rhizome most of
them went around
but what if they'd just driven there and
gotten out of their drugs
if they outnumbered them five to one
what would happen
i'm not suggesting that there should be
violence i don't recommend violence
but numbers change situations
the crowds have the upper hand over the
police because there are far
more people in the crowds than there are
in the police
but what if that reversed what if there
were ten times as many citizens who
didn't want
an antifa protester situation
then there were protesters and they
don't have to be armed
they just have to be there and they have
to be in a you know in a solid block and
just walk down the street
clear out their city now i don't know if
that'll happen i don't even know if it's
a good idea it might cause more trouble
than it
than it uh solves but you can't have
that option
without knowing how many people are
involved each night so you can kind of
track
is this a growing problem or a shrinking
problem
what's this look like it's just curious
that the most
obvious piece of reporting how many
people
showed up you always have this but not
now
you know what else you don't notice a
lot the death rate
of coronavirus go to cnn
and see if you can easily click from
let's say their homepage
and see how long it takes you to find
some reporting
on the the death rate of chronovirus in
this country
which i would argue is the number one
biggest story
right isn't it the biggest story tell me
what was the what was the death rate
today is it going up or is it going down
they'll tell you the infection rate
they'll tell you the infection rate but
the
infection rate and the death rate are
moving in opposite directions or have
been
i'd need a confirmation of that
yeah so why are we not being informed
about that it's not a coincidence
i don't think so so about two months ago
i caused a little trouble for myself
knowingly
usually these days when i when i get
into trouble
it's because i did it intentionally and
i did it for some
strategic purpose so i think it was
just about two months ago i tweeted that
if biden gets elected that republicans
would be hunted
now can you imagine how much i was
mocked by that
two months ago because it's almost hard
to put your your head in
just two months ago because things
change so quickly now it feels like a
million years ago
but two months ago it just seemed
patently ridiculous for somebody to say
that republicans would be hunted now i
said after
biden won so we don't know that yet
but i think people's opinion about
whether it could happen
has completely changed in two months
over to a little bit closer to what i'm
thinking
because we're watching in the news trump
supporters being targeted for violence
already that's undeniable it's
that is a now a matter of fact that
there are multiple cases
of trump supporters being targeted for
violence just for political opinion
that's it um
i should mention tim poole you all know
tim poole
um well-known respected
podcaster and uh probably a journalist
independent journalist would that be a
better
description he was one of the people who
uh
mocked me a couple months ago for having
what looked like
a very hyperbolic opinion
i think it was yesterday that he
actually issued a public apology
what to me and said other people owed me
an apology
because my prediction looks like it's
going to be a lot
closer to correct at least in terms of
the danger to republicans
the part about biden winning was always
stated
in an if now i don't think that
i don't think we're quite there meaning
i
i think while i greatly respect
tim offering the apology which i
immediately accepted
um i i don't know that he's
he quite owed me that because i think
you'd have to see
tragically you would have to see more of
more of this to really know that there's
a pattern
it looks like a pattern but
you still have you could be easily
fooled by you know coincidence and
anecdote
so we don't know but i did appreciate
that he did that
and i'll say this
this is a version of the principle that
people work in retail know this to be
true that a customer that complains
and then you fix their complaint to
their satisfaction
will almost always be a better return
repeat customer
than someone who never had a complaint
that's very well documented effect
if they complain and you fix it they
feel special and they come back
and they appreciate the fix far more
than they
they can care about the fact that there
was an initial
problem because everybody understands
it's an imperfect world
um so similarly
it is very common for people to mock
other people
i think i did it three times today
already so mocking people is simple and
universal but what is rare is circling
back two months later and saying i was
wrong you know the other one was closer
to wright on this
that's really rare tim poole did this in
public
without being prompted nobody prompted
him as far as i know i didn't
i've forgotten all about it and that's
rare
so that has to be called out for um
again i would say being wrong and
apologizing in public without prompting
is a way higher level of human being
than just being right being right in the
first place
isn't nearly as honorable as good as it
is everybody wants to be right
but being right in the first place and
just staying right
is cool but you know it's nothing you
would respect or not respect it's just
hey that's cool i'm
glad you're right but a public apology
very rare it's a sign of character that
must be noted
and so i do and yes i unblocked
immediately
those who asked all right um
the splc has so far you know them the
southern poverty
law center so they're used by in fact
check me if i'm wrong but i think at
least
facebook maybe others use them as a
source to know
what groups or people are involved with
hate speech
and that informs the platforms how to
deal with people on their platform
now the splc has refused to list antifa
as
an extremist group what
are you kidding me that
as of today the splc doesn't see a
problem with antifa
seriously how many people do they have
to murder
before you could say hey that's a group
we should be looking at
and the reason i ask is because at one
point i don't know if he's still on
there but at one point
dr ben carson was on their list
and i'm trying to understand what was
their threshold for being on their hate
group list
if ben carson made the threshold
according to them but antifa has not
and black lives matter the the group not
the concept
they black lives matter has never has
never reached
the threshold of being an extremist
dangerous group
are you kidding me so obviously the splc
is not a legitimate organization
it's going to get more and more
embarrassing if you're using them for
uh as your source of truth
at this point and can you fact check me
on this is facebook that uses them right
as one of their one of their several
sources of input that's embarrassing at
this point
i can't i can't understand how they
would continue to do that
so anybody who's paying the splc for
their opinions they've been completely
ripped of their credibility if they ever
had any so this is the least
credible group you would ever have so i
would say that
the facebooks etc if they're using that
group
to try to avoid let's say you to ward
off
any kind of government regulation shall
we say
i don't think that's going to work if
you want to get regulated just keep
using the splc as your
source of knowing who's a hate group
that'll get you regulated
just take a little longer but that's
that's like a direct line to regulation
if if you hear i don't know how long it
will take let's say
18 months from now if in 18 months
the splc is still the advisor of who's a
hate group
for facebook fact-checked me that
they're still doing that
uh in 18 months they're still doing that
facebook is going to get regulated or
dismantled
that that's not a situation that can can
stand for the long run
um joe biden fixed all of the
violence in america i don't know what
took him so long
but he issued a statement and he said
that the deadly violence we saw
overnight in portland is unacceptable
and i thought to myself whoa
it's unacceptable why didn't he tell us
this before
do you know how many people got hurt
while we were waiting for biden to tell
us that the
the overnight deadly violence is
unacceptable
i'm glad it's finally fixed with that
sternly worded statement
because without the sternly worded
statement of condemnation
we would have had more violence but
tonight
won't be any those protests will be
done if i understand how sternly worded
statements work
because if a sternly worded
generic statement that's exactly what
you'd expect somebody to say
if if that works
we should be doing more of it and i'd
have to ask why
is the president not also
issuing daily sternly wording
sternly worded condemnations does the
president not know how effective this
is does he not know that with a tweet or
two
he could end the violence like joe biden
did
somebody should tell the president
all right so joe biden's a worthless
bag of hoaxes basically he sort of
when i think of joe biden i i tend to
think in visual terms and
i translate people into their their
animal spirit sometimes
i see people as their animal you know
once you see somebody's animal you can't
stop seeing it
but in joe biden's case i don't see an
animal with him
meaning some kind of animal that reminds
me of that's very common i'll see
i'll see people will say you remind me
of a duck
i don't know why but you remind me of a
duck and now i can't see
i can't unsee it you'll always be a duck
to me
but biden reminds me of an old
leather pouch that is full of hoaxes
because all that comes out of him is
hoaxes and sort of ordinary stuff that's
stale
you know stale condemnations of i don't
like
violence i know this will come as a
surprise to you
but i am opposed to violence and it's
this old
crumbly leather bag and that's it
doesn't have eyes
maybe has a few strands of hair that are
just you know like
came off the horse or something so that
looks like his hair plugs
but yeah he's a is no leather bag full
of hoaxes
so that's who's running against the
strongest
the strongest politician in a hundred
years
uh should be close all right
the new york times ran a big article uh
explaining why the the very accurate
testing that we've been favoring
in the united states for the coronavirus
is actually exactly the wrong thing
and that what you need is something less
sensitive i'll use the
try to use the correct word less
sensitive but so
cheap you can use it a lot and you could
you could stamp out the virus in a few
weeks now i had said to you
that the math of it is so compelling
meaning that
as soon as it is explained to you
properly
you immediately say oh okay i get it
i was thinking that you meant something
else so this is one of these
rare situations where literally the only
thing it takes
to take somebody who thinks it's a bad
idea and
transform them into somebody who says oh
oh
i didn't know that's what you meant that
is a good idea is simply explaining it
to them
but this one's a little hard to explain
because it's counterintuitive
but once you hear it like you have to
really concentrate for about
five minutes which is a lot in these
days
and i would imagine that getting a
president to concentrate on anything for
five minutes is actually kind of hard
because imagine how many things he's
dealing with during the course of the
day
getting a solid five minutes on some you
know
corner of a topic it's probably a lot to
do and i had
i had speculated that nobody had done
that for
president trump because the moment
somebody does that for you
you say this is it okay we gotta we
gotta at least find out if this is real
you could be surprised later and find
out it's not what you thought it was
but you would definitely stop what you
were doing and say uh
i didn't realize this was so promising
these inexpensive
yet less sensitive tests could eliminate
the virus probably in three weeks if we
had it now when i say eliminate i don't
mean literally i just mean
to the point where your economy is open
and life is back to normal
but we would still be picking up the
virus for quite some time we would just
be able to deal with it
really really efficiently not the way we
deal with it now
so now that it's hit the new york times
and
i like i'd like to feel that i was at
least some contributor to
raising the profile of that with uh was
it
mina who's the primary driver of it
and a number of other people so i'm not
going to take you know any credit except
that i was a participant
one of a number of participants and just
trying to boost this
to get an answer on it so maybe maybe
something good is happening because it
was in the new york times
here's something that will scare you or
should
there is reporting that uh the democrats
um are going to be using a darpa funded
ai driven information warfare tool
to target pro-trump accounts yes
an actual military-grade mind control
is going to be uh implemented for this
election
military grade that's not a i'm not
exaggerating sometimes i say things are
military grade
just to say they're powerful but this is
actually
literally literally a military
you know weapon that will be used
against uh
used domestically because there's no
rule against it it's a weapon that
doesn't
it's not kinetic uh it's not poison
so apparently there's no law against it
there's no law against brainwashing
uh your own citizens apparently and
who's in charge of this i guess if
somebody
you know unimportant was in charge of it
you wouldn't worry about it too much
right
so let's see who's in charge of it
general mcchrystal
who was he fired by obama
he was he was in charge of afghanistan
did obama fire him
not sure if i remember that correct
check me on that
but an actual military general who is
familiar with these
tools from his work in the military
is aligning with some kind of democrat
political action committee
to quote this is from a fox news site
to quote planning to deploy the
technology initially developed to
counter terrorist propaganda
to combat president trump's campaign
messages about the coronavirus
an effort that will benefit his
challenger
joe biden according to a report
so the group is called defeat disinfo
now here's the first
brainwashing trick if i told you
that there was a tool that would be used
by military general
domestically to brainwash the public
what would you say you'd say exactly
what you just thought which was
whoa we don't want any of that
we don't want a military general using a
military brainwashing
technique to brainwash our citizens
during an election
that would literally be the worst thing
that could ever happen right
you all think that so what do they say
that they are doing instead of that what
they
they even put in the name defeat disinfo
they are framing this as defeating
president trump's brainwashing
they're actually selling this and will
succeed by the way
they will succeed at this why
because it's military-grade brainwashing
it will succeed they will first succeed
in telling you that it's not what you
think it is and they will succeed at
that
people at least for the democrats that's
all the only ones they have to
convince really they will convince the
democrats that all that's happening
is they found a technology that will
help
get rid of president trump's
disinformation
and they will sell that that's what
they're doing
that's not what they're doing they may
do that
also but what they're doing is just flat
brainwashing
there's no nuance to it it is flat
brainwashing
and it involves you know i would imagine
not only messaging
but the way they deliver the message and
i think some of this
uh depends on using social media to
build a counter narrative
through a network of 3.4 million
influencers across the country
even paying some users this is again
from the fox
news site even paying some users with
large followings
to oppose the president that's right
there will be people who you think are
citizens who just have big accounts
who will be paid to
disseminate brainwashing propaganda
that's not speculative it's not even
what they're not admitting
apparently this is just publicly known
and there's no there's no counter
narrative to it this is exactly what's
happening
i'm not making any of this up this is
national news
does that scare you well let me set it
up this way
on the democrat side they have
our highest level of military experience
software tools and network
to literally brainwash the public so
that's what the democrats have
what the republicans have
is me
[Laughter]
so i'd say it's a fair fight
um now i say that jokingly of course
president trump is the most powerful
um let's say i've called him a
persuasion you know expert in different
words
so that's actually a fair fight
the most powerful military brainwashing
against
president trump and his somewhat
let's call it volunteer patriot army
of hypnotists mindset experts
and influencers who do you bet on
you get a bet on the military we do have
the best military
in the history of civilization
all right if if you were going to bet on
the us military's best
brainwashing weapons and most highly
chained general
versus a ragtag group of
who me mike cernovich
[Applause]
yeah half a dozen other people that come
to mind who are good at this stuff
and the president does it seem like a
fair fight
it's a fair fight it is a fair fight and
they don't know what's coming for them
they really don't
the democrats have no idea what's coming
for them
the next two months are just going to be
lit
you won't know what's true by november
you will you won't know if you exist by
november
everything you knew about reality is
just going to get
blown up and if you can reassemble it
before election day good luck
but your brain is going to get scrambled
you're going to be getting it from every
direction
and you're not getting it from amateurs
this is professional now
this is purely professional work with
some amateurs who are who are helping
out
uh but even the amateurs in this case
know what they're doing
so i've said this before that i see the
world
as there's this movie underworld it's
one of my favorite
movies with kate beckinsal who plays
this
uh you know kind of a vampire hunter
and in this movie the the general idea
is that the humans are unaware
we're just going about our lives unaware
that the vampires and the werewolves
who live underground mostly are having
this war
that's sort of a perpetual war and it's
a big war but we're just going along our
day and we don't know that we're right
in the middle
of a vampire you know werewolf war
that's how exactly how i see the world
except
there's more than one war there are
actually
several wars going on under the surface
that sometimes i get to see because i
have
i have a white privileged view
actually i don't know if the white part
has anything to do with it but i do have
a
privileged a privileged view
into a lot of stuff that you don't get
to see
for a variety of reasons people people
want me to see what they're doing
often people say hey look what i'm doing
do you think this is
going to work or not so i just sort of
see a lot of stuff
that you don't get to see and i trust me
there are several raging wars
just under the surface that you just
don't see what you see sometimes is the
outcome
but you think it's due to just news like
you'll see
let's say you'll see something really
bad happens to a famous person
on either side they're either democrat
or they're the republican
and there's there's this terrible
tragedy that happens to him in terms of
let's say some news comes out and you
think to yourself wow that was
that was bad luck nope that was probably
somebody who
who fell to the war that you're not
watching
there there were there were people who
actually got taken out
by either the vampires or the werewolves
and you have no idea that's what
happened
all you know is somebody decided to take
some time off from politics you know you
you see just
sort of the the sanitized uh
ultimate partisan well it looks like
this person decided to change careers
or that sort of thing but
um what you're going to see in the next
few months will be
just crazy it's not going to be like
anything you've seen before
it will be crazy but
when it's over we will be still the
united states
we will be the united states when this
is over
we will have a perfect union
as perfect as it could be we will
still have our constitution
will be a nation of laws
we will be the strongest country on the
planet
earth we will
but the next two months crazy
they're gonna be crazy get ready
just remember that on the other end of
it
it's gonna be cool because it will be
and everything you see think of it more
like a nightmare
think of it none of it is real assume
that
every story you hear is manufactured by
either a werewolf
or a vampire from now until election day
only the vampires and the wolves control
the news cycle
in other times they can step back and
let the news just be the news
but for the next couple months it's
werewolves or vampires
you'll never see them but the news
is not the real news from now until
november it never has been
but it will be at a level you've never
seen before for example
was it the new york times who had a big
story this week
that i get lost in all the details of
the
russia collusion stuff but to the extent
that um
that was it rosenstein who stopped
looking into
trump's situation and didn't tell the
fbi or some story like
that and then uh somebody who was
actually there
one of the top prosecutors for mueller
just came in
after the story is written and
everybody's digested it and it's your
truth for now
comes in after the fact and said no no
that's true
i work there i work there
none of that's true and but it seemed
it seemed a little true to you for a few
days didn't it now i have to confess
i saw the new york times story mention
of it i read the headlines and the first
few
words to hear what it was about and i
immediately said
no that's that's coming from a vampire
or a werewolf
that's not that's not true so i'll just
ignore it
for a few days sure enough you ignore it
for a few days
somebody comes out who actually was
there and says
no none of that happened that's just
completely made up
that's what happened so
you got that going on
uh mike cernovich also said that the
bots are back
the the bots who are you know you see
around election time
now i have told you that my bots are
back as well so
i have more bot activity than ever it's
not nearly as bad as it was in 2016
but remember i told you that there's one
really
really hard-working bot who every time i
block he opens up a new account
and he changes the profile picture to my
deceased
stepson's picture and then he writes
horrible things about me
as a step parent for letting him die
that is that's the accusation now
do you think that that came from just
an individual who was very concerned
about that specific
story and has a mission
to say something about it or maybe
there's some bigger point
or just going to put it out there
or when i see that is that the obvious
outcome
of a military operation against me
what would you say does the fact that
this
troll is so hard working i mean this is
somebody who's putting serious time
into it you know they they've carved
down something in their schedule
to only plague me
with pictures of my deceased stepson
well it's fresh in my mind
does that sound like just a citizen who
just decided to take action
doesn't like me thought this would hurt
me does that sound like a citizen
or does it sound like a military-grade
brainwashing operation designed to take
me off the field
because if i were an advanced
ai military brainwashing operation
i would look for the most influential
people
and i would target them first you're the
military
you're not going to target people who
are unimportant you're going to target
people who can move the needle
people who have a track record of
predicting
and influencing you would go after them
first so you would see
um watch this so mike cernovich seems to
have
decided that he's going to back trump
there was some question about that
earlier on
but it seems he's made that decision i
can't speak for his mind but
just in terms of his tweets it looks
like he's he's going that way
and he says that the the bots have
attacked him
you should expect that between now and
election day
there will be a fake news story about
mike cernovich
watch for this you'll see you'll see
something that just doesn't
you know why did this pop up now so i
would imagine that there literally are
people who are huddling trying to figure
out how to take him out take him out
likewise i would expect that there are
people huddling and literally planning
on what's the best psychological way to
get into my head
and take me out now i'm kind of unusual
and that i'm trained i'm a trained
hypnotist
i can sort of recognize technique a
little bit better when it's coming at me
so i've got a little bit of defense
a little bit of defense i was 77 is he
on the periscope now
probably because i mean i i blocked him
yet again the other day but i imagine
he's back
so look for that um
i tweeted the other day that we might be
witnessing the end of the democratic
party for decades
do you think that's true it's just one
of the possibilities
if you're if you're imagining the future
and you're saying okay the
the future could take this path or that
path what are the paths
this that's really wide right now that
you can see really clearly
doesn't mean it's going to go that way
but the widest
cleanest straightest path from where we
are right now
would be was a semi-destruction of the
democratic party for
decades you know when lyndon johnson
famously passed
what was it civil rights legislation
and he was said to have commented very
grotesquely
that that the democrats would have the
black votes for
generations and sure enough
and they earned it all right nobody says
they didn't earn it
if the democrats passed the legislation
the
that was good for the you know the black
community they recognized it they voted
democrat
hey they earned it they got that fair
and square
but at the moment you're watching the
democrats
rip apart the fabric of civilization and
set back
black lives in terms of you know how
they fit into american society
probably set back their effort by 20
years
um i would say that the the branding
and the the visuals and and the way our
brains are being influenced by watching
the the protests um certainly have
made people far more prejudiced than
they've ever been
in my lifetime i would say that right
now people
are the most angry about other groups
than probably i've ever seen and i've
been around a while
and that's the democrats and that's the
brainwashing and the fake news
they've done this satanic trick
in this case the this is not uh
hyperbole it's just description
a satanic trip if i can quote
uh kevin spacey from the usual suspects
yeah the the best trick satan ever
pulled
was convincing the world he didn't exist
and the fake news has done that they
have done the satan trick
they've convinced you that there's no
fake news or they've convinced a segment
of the population that there's no fake
news
and therefore since fake news doesn't
exist
that's the satanic part that it doesn't
exist
it must be trump's fault trump's the
leader
so whatever's going on that looks like
social division well it's got to be the
leader
now if you're not brainwashed by
this satanic trick where you can
actually see that the fake news is
continually fake news and they don't
even hide it anymore and we're
we're way beyond the fact we're way
beyond the place
where the fake news was hiding it it's
just right there now
they'll just put it out like they don't
care uh
in that world the republicans at least
see what's going on in that regard but
democrats
actually think there's no such thing as
fake news
at least on their side they don't think
it's fake news can you imagine
from so most of you are you know
pro-trump uh type
viewers can you wrap your head around
the fact
that something like half the country
hasn't
noticed that all of their news is just
made up
that they haven't noticed can that's
hard to wrap your head around isn't it
but that's what's happening and if you
were a trained hypnotist or trained
psychologist
you actually wouldn't be surprised about
that because cognitive dissonance
is really powerful and it it predicts
this is exactly what people would think
because for the democrats to believe
that their news is fake news would be to
believe
that they've been wrong about a lot of
stuff and people can't do that
so that's what makes cognitive
dissonance
kick in so president trump has decided
that he's
wants to go to kenosha and visit that's
a pretty powerful move
powerful because the coronavirus
powerful because the demonstrations were
in some ways they had the an anti-trump
flavor to them
so for him to go there it's kind of a
it's a strong move
and some would say ill-advised but
that's how strong it is
it's so strong that other people say i
don't even know if you should do that
which is by the way trump's sweet spot
do you know what trump likes to do he
likes to do things that are so strong
other people think it's a bad idea let's
move our embassy to jerusalem oh you
can't do that
whoa whoa whoa that's too strong
that's okay worked out let's uh
recognize
the golan heights as part of israel whoa
whoa whoa
whoa that's that's a little strong you
know
back up a little bit president trump
that's gone too far
it worked out oh okay well i didn't
think that would work out
um i'm gonna i'm gonna kill the iran
deal
oh that seems like it's starting to move
in our direction
so this is his sweet spot doing things
that other people say
that's too much and then it works out
because he can make it work
the governor of wisconsin is encouraging
him not to come
why because this would be one of the
triggers
to begin generations of democrats being
out of power
because biden has already said he won't
go
because he's afraid now he didn't say
because i'm afraid but how else do you
interpret it
i don't know another way to interpret it
now that doesn't mean he's afraid for
his own safety necessarily although you
always have to worry about that
he's probably concerned about you know
the the larger
everything that would happen if he went
there
but it makes him look weak and it makes
it look like the president cares about
the citizens who have their livelihoods
stripped away from them it's a i think
it's
wisconsin is a battleground state right
i'm not sure if you technically
which ones are technically battleground
and which ones are just
in play if there's any difference
and i think this is just this is a
killer move
i mean this is this is a predator move
versus prey when you see trump
going toward the trouble like a boss
how do you feel about that good right if
you feel like your leader is a leader
and he's going toward trouble
like a boss what do you think of biden
who said yeah i think i'll stay in my
basement a little bit longer
not like a boss it's the difference
between a predator
and prey nobody wants their leader
to be prey even if you don't like the
predator
if he's on your side if the predator is
on your side
you just get more meat that's how it
works
so i think people are going to go with
the more meat option
on this election and the wisconsin
governor knows that this is a big
problem for democrats
so he was trying to discourage it um
to your surprise but maybe you shouldn't
be surprised
joe scarborough is coming out strongly
against the democratic leaders of these
cities
and strongly encouraging them at least
by tweet and probably more
to clamp down on it and to accept
trump's help to to get rid of the
trouble
now you know as you know joe scarborough
is
famously you know super anti-trump
but on this issue he is completely trump
uh meaning compatible with with a trump
opinion
and i like to just call that out
i just like to call that out because i
don't know if this is easy to do
if you were you know if you've branded
yourself as an anti-trumper and that's
your career
but it is a patriotic thing to do
it's patriotic i would say that joe
scarborough
in in this situation not judging
anything
else he's ever done in his life but in
this
this one situation about the cities and
the demonstrations and the violence
he's being a patriot so thank you
appreciate it have you noticed
there's there's something that's
happening in a slow trickle that's
becoming a fast
trickle and it's going to turn into a
waterfall
and we're right about there so you've
been hearing about let's say
yesterday ivanka tweeted this that the
u.s marshals service
found 39 missing children in georgia
over two weeks in an operation known as
operation not forgotten
uh what there were
39 children who were missing
missing 39 of them and that's just the
ones they found
in two weeks in one state
two weeks one state 39
missing kids are you freaking kidding me
also you've seen a number of people
identified fairly quickly
when their faces were shown committing a
crime there was the
uh somebody tried was doing a rape in
broad daylight i think it was on a
manhattan subway platform
his face was visible in some video
footage
got caught right away the
the guy who shot the trump supporter in
uh portland they got him
so if he was on video they can catch him
now
wha what is it that's happening that i
say is a trickle
that will turn into a gush and then a
waterfall
here's what's different there are two
technologies
that when you hear about them you say oh
those are cool but you don't quite
understand how cool they are yet
because you might think well that's a
little creepy and and that
you know that distracts you one of them
is uh
othrum for example the company that will
if you have
any dna let's say from some kind of a
sex crime
if they have any dna in the old days
they couldn't even test it
if they could they could find you if you
happen to be a criminal in their
database
but that's a small database compared to
the whole world
so mostly you just couldn't get people
even if you had their dna
that has changed authorum's technology
allows you to find a family connection
which at this point you can do and find
most of them
you know not 100 but you can get pretty
close
and then also you have clear view and
other companies that are doing
facial recognition so these days
if you have any picture of a face or
any dna your odds of getting caught
are really high and the ones that
clearly are the ones that
are the the ones you would target would
be
child trafficking and unsolved
and and even fresher rape cases
and any kind of violence where
somebody's face is shown those three
categories
have just moved from the really hard to
solve into
we got you every time
all right you're gonna see a flood of
solved uh sex crimes child trafficking
crimes
and violence of anybody who had who
showed up on camera
they're all going to get solved they're
very close you know nothing's 100
but they can get pretty close let's say
90 percent for a working number
about 90 percent of these unsolvable
crimes are now solvable
this year just this year this is
this is brand new when you put together
you know the others and the clear views
good luck being a criminal it's a bad
time to be a criminal
uh so you got that all right
so the republicans are trying the
democrat
technique of hoax edits
so i guess scalise and allies as they're
called
uh put together a video in which they
doctored
by adding the the phrase of four police
to the end of
uh this disabled man's statements about
biden
and made it seem as though biden wanted
to
defund the police but in fact when you
put the
the if you take away the the doctor part
it only says that he wants to take money
away from the police and give it
somewhere else
what now you might say to yourself
well that sounds a lot like defunding
the police but it does have some nuance
because if you do it right you're not
defunding and leaving a gap
you're moving funding into something
that fills the gap
ideally better than the way it was
filled before so
you know that's the real intent but
apparently uh
with this hoax edit uh it made it look
like a little bit more like just
defunding the police
even though it's not that big a
difference so
and then i guess it was taken off now
because the democrats opened this door
that the fake edits seem to live forever
you know the the fine people hoax is a
fake edit the drinking disinfectant
there's a fake edit the
over feeding the koi fish is a fake edit
so it looks like the republicans have
just said well we'll do that too
if if we can live for four years with
cnn
never correcting a fake edit hoax
they know it's a hoax and they never
correct it
why can't they do it the tool is there
you know once once the democrats have
established
that a hoax edit will still live and
work
even after it's been debunked it doesn't
make any difference at all and the other
side is doing it
not just a little but is literally joe
biden's
primary campaign thrust is these two
hoax edit things the disinfectant thing
and the fine people oaks so why wouldn't
republicans do it
i'm not recommending it but you'd be
naive to assume they wouldn't give it a
try because it works pretty well
all right if you think that you can tell
which
leaders are the best leaders in terms of
how they
how they did with coronavirus i would
ask you to perform this following test
lump together the states in the united
states
that handle things roughly the same
whatever that means you know either they
were tough on masks or not
or or whatever take out the nursing home
part
because i think that has to be you know
a special case
just take out the nursing home part and
then compare all the states
by what techniques they used and see if
there's a difference
because if all the states that use the
same kind of leadership and the same
decisions
got different results then you'd have to
say leadership
is not a variable that matters too much
which is my opinion
that leadership is not a variable that
matters too much
because all of the leaders could only
deal with the tools that they had
not the tools they wish they had but the
tools they had
the country they have not the one they
wish they had the
you know the fact that our test kits
were garbage in the beginning
what leader would have gotten that right
if you took the new zealand
president put her put her in charge of
the united states which he had fixed
those bad test kits before they were
launched
no she wouldn't know there was anything
wrong with them so
if you think leadership is the deciding
factor
it's a simple test just look at our
different states
see if the ones who managed it the same
way got the same results
i don't know what the answer to that is
but i don't think it's going to be
as clean as people would imagine
there is a an article i
tweeted i think yesterday that the idea
that we live in the simulation
is getting closer and closer to
something like a proof
now it's not there but what you would
look for is all the evidence
you know in every little way that
there's something wrong with our reality
in other words there's something that
just doesn't make sense
if we're an actual reality the way we
think we are
but would only make sense if we're a
programmed software simulation
and there you'll have to read the
article but there are plenty of
there's new experimental uh
let's say evidence that reality is very
subjective
meaning that you're actually creating
reality as you go
including maybe the past
because if you can create the past
well that's a simulation because the way
you'd write a simulation is you wouldn't
fill in all the details of the past
until somebody needed it you know my
example is
if you go digging in your backyard and
nobody has ever dug there before
the simulation doesn't have to put
anything there except randomly
it could put a dinosaur of the bone
there and then maybe there would be some
under your neighbor's
homes but until one of you dug there
would have been
no dinosaur bones under anybody's house
but when you hit the dinosaur bone then
the simulation said i guess it's a
dinosaur burial ground
and gave some dinosaur bones under the
other houses so that's what a simulation
would be
because you wouldn't program that in
advance you'd wait until you needed it
and say ah this guy needs a history for
why did that bone get under
under the ground okay we'll give him a
dinosaur
so uh look for that
all right that's all i got now
um somebody says it is a sim
if it's a sim then by definition there
is a god
by definition there would be an
intelligent design
if we were a simulation you can put any
word on that you want
how is this view helpful let me tell you
how
um if we are a simulation and
if we get to rewrite our our situation
the thing you would look for is that
people who have that belief
that you can sort of author your own
your own view would be able to
have better results than people who
didn't
so people who believe in this worldview
for example are
elon musk elon musk believes that
you know or at least he says it who
knows what he actually thinks but he
says that the simulation is the most
likely explanation
does elon musk have a life that would
suggest
he can directly manipulate the
simulation
yeah he does yeah he does
i mean pretty much everything he does
looks like he directly controls the
simulation
he's got 35 billion dollars to show for
it or
something like that he's rich
do i look like i manipulate
the simulation have you been watching me
a while
if i don't look to you like i can
rewrite this simulation
i don't think you've been paying
attention that doesn't mean i am
could be just an illusion but what you
would look for is all the people who
think they can write it
seem to be getting better results so i
do believe that if we are characters in
some kind of a software game
that we have at least the power to
be aware of it and then start crafting
our own
reality and it could be different your
reality could
be completely in conflict with mind but
as long as you and i don't talk
it's fine that's exactly how you would
write software
you wouldn't waste all of your software
resources
making your history and my history
compatible
when it would be easier for me to say i
think you're lying or mistaken
and the other person to say no your
history that you tell me is right
no i think you're lying or mistaken that
would be the shortcut
it would be cognitive dissonance in the
way we experience it
just like you experience it all right
um i'm asking that in
2008 i don't know what that comment
means
uh yes it's the user interface for
reality if you want to see more of this
just google
the user interface for reality and my
name and you'll see my
longer explanation of this that's all i
got for now
and i'll talk to you later
