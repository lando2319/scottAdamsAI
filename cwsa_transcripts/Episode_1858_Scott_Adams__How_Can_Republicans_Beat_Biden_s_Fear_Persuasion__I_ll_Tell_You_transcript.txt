dude
good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
i made it just in time
yes i was carried away with looking at
stuff on twitter
does it sound like a new song
and yes my iq is still 185
according to the internet
we can get different opinions from
different sources but
finally
finally we're here
ladies and gentlemen would you like to
take it up a full notch
yes you would and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tank and
chelsea stein the canteen sugar flask a
vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
and it's the best thing that ever
happened to you it's happening now go
good stuff
so here's my question
is it too soon for republicans to start
asking for reparations
because i feel like there's an argument
to be made
am i wrong
are not republicans being
discriminated against and demonized by
their president
are they not being jailed in some cases
for political purposes and hunted
makes you wonder what is the standard
now what what is the worst thing that's
ever happened to the united states
not the worst thing but what is the
least worst thing
that actually got reparations
if we say
yeah they so the japanese internment
camps
one of the most horrible things the
country has ever done
reparations
now i don't know that anything that bad
has happened to republicans except the
ones in jail i suppose
but
where where is that line where you can
say you know you've crossed that line
now we've got to talk about reparations
let's talk about reparations a little
bit
because it seems to me that what i
what i witnessed for the last two years
maybe the last year
is republicans had everything running
fine
seems like the country was sort of a
pretty good situation
and then democrats ripped that all away
with energy policy and
you know ukraine
whatever they're doing there
it it feels as if
you know the republicans had things
working pretty well and it was just
ripped away
now i'm not serious i don't think you
can get reparations
but uh
i was uh
i think i was
i went down this path because i saw a
fascinating little clip
from jack murphy
who's a good follow if you don't follow
jack murphy you should
but there's a clip of him he tweeted
around i guess i don't know when he was
talking about it was in the past i guess
but he told he talked about
a way to understand what happened in
2020
and
i love his frame
and the frame is this so the normal
frame
is that there was something called an
election
and then the two teams they both said
what what they could do
alright here's what i could do if you
elect me
here's what i could do if you like me
and then the voters looked at those two
competing
propositions
and according to the official count
biden won
according to you know
according to the official outcome
now
here's jack's take on the same situation
the
democrats strategy
is to make their own people so
uncomfortable
that they'll do anything you tell them
to make the pain stop
[Laughter]
and the pain and the pain was
a continuous fear that trump was going
to destroy the world
and i don't think you and i
you know if you were not subject to that
persuasion i don't think you and i can
appreciate how bad that must have been
imagine waking up every day thinking the
world is going to burn
because trump's a president
[Laughter]
and you know they always say
that winning elections is about what
you're voting against
yeah that's one of the wise things you
hear
but also about
energizing your base
so
so biden managed to energize his base
and give them something to vote against
by making them so unhappy with their own
lives
that they would do anything to make the
pain stop
now
once you hear that explanation of
of
what we saw
it's hard to lose it isn't it
it's just a better framework for
understanding what you just saw it's the
team that can torture their own people
the hardest
that's what it is
if you put that together that it's
always voting against something and
usually there's a fear involved
right it's not so much people are not
voting for good times they're voting to
make their fear go away
and
so that's our system our system is
two leaders who will torture their own
supporters to see who can torture them
the most
because who can ever
scare them the most and make their own
people the most uncomfortable
they'll vote the most
they can get them off the couch
so we've literally developed a system to
see who can torture their own supporters
the most and whoever whoever is willing
to do it they get to win they get to be
president
now
you tell me that's wrong
am i wrong
what part of that is not 100 accurate
none of it
that is an exact perfect description
of our system
whoever can torture their own followers
the hardest
they win the election
because remember you're not really
convincing the other team they're not
even listening to you you're just trying
to get your own people to get off the
couch and do something that's it that's
the whole game
now
i was asked on twitter this morning
what could republicans do to beat um
biden's fear of persuasion because he's
going for
instead of saying here are all the good
things i'll do for you
bite into saying watch out for those
ultra mega
extremists
and trump is who you should worry about
and anybody who follows trump
that's fear persuasion right
they're all the neo-nazis they're coming
for you the fascists
so how do you beat fear persuasion
anybody
anybody
what is the only technique that can beat
fear persuasion
not the high ground
high ground will not help you one bit
against fear persuasion
because nobody can hear the high ground
the high ground is just noise if you're
afraid if you're afraid you have to
solve your fear
you solve your fear first and then you
can hear the high ground argument
right now i often i often incorrectly
say the high ground wins every argument
but that's every argument where there's
no fear
because that's the normal situation the
normal situation is you're just in some
corporate meeting
and you're talking about two options
neither of them are scary
in that case
the high ground wins every time
but in the situations and it's usually
political where you have an actual fear
of life and death
nothing beats that
so right now biden has a path to
re-election
and nothing to stop him
because he has the superior persuasion
by far by far
like that the stuff he's doing is
completely unethical
completely unethical a lot of it is just
based on pure lies
but is it working yeah
yeah fear works fear is the
you know it's the apex predator nothing
beats fear
the only thing that keeps people from
using fear all the time
is that you don't want to be a giant
dick
because when you scare people they don't
like it
it's very unpleasant to be afraid
so you have to be the bigger dick
to win in a game of fear
so the person who can push the hardest
and bend the boundaries the most
the one who is most
let's say skilled at hyperbole
is going to be the one who can win
now name one republican who is not named
trump
who could beat biden for fear persuasion
because you've seen his game so you know
what biden can do
and you know you know what he's focusing
on the mega extremists as he says
desantis not even close
desantis is too much of a technocrat
and i mean that as a compliment
i mean if you want if you had if you
were going to choose somebody to run
your government
desantis is pretty good good choice if
that's you know if that's the type of
leadership you want
but he doesn't scare me
when was the last time desantis scared
you
you know he says there are these
problems we have these solutions and it
all makes sense and he's popular and
he's funny and he's interesting but he's
not going to scare you
i can't think of anything he ever said
that scared me
there's only one candidate that can
scare you
there's only one
and his name is trump
so here is here's what we're down to
as much as i love uh you know tom cotton
for example as an alternative
as much as i like his skills
he's not going to scare you like trump
will
he doesn't have that
um
well i just don't think he would bend
the rules enough to get that done
right
so
there's only one way you're going to be
biden at this point because he's taken a
pure
you know i hate to say it but he's
taking a trumpian
um
approach
which is take the the best persuasion
you can take and just ride it hard
that's what trump did he just picked the
scariest stuff and he wrote it hard and
it worked
so biden's doing the same thing
and he's got that extra benefit of the
the media will back him and say the maga
people are extremists and stuff like
that
so
here's the only thing that will get you
a republican president
trump as a candidate
now i'm not saying you know i'm not
saying i want him or don't want him
i'm not saying he would be the best
president or not the best
there's a lot to be said for a
desantis or tom cotton yeah there are
other people you could say well they'd
be really serious
serious candidates
but he's the only one
who will bend the rules enough
to scare you enough
to get you to vote
nobody else is going to scare you enough
to get you off the couch he'll scare the
 out of you if you want him to
you'll give he'll give you just what you
need to get you off the couch
i don't think anybody else could do it
now
uh
somebody says wrong
what's the wrong part
what's the wrong part yeah talker
talking is pretty scary
uh never let a crisis go to waste
so i i think trump has the
what will i do about that thing already
covered
because he's been president so you
pretty much know what he's going to do
like all the mystery has been removed
so since you know he has a set of
solutions which
clearly seemed to be somewhat effective
before
you know he was doing better on a lot of
things
all he really needs to do is scare you
that biden biden is coming for your guns
and you're
raising your taxes and he's going to
destroy the whole country
and i think he can make the case
so that's what i would look for i would
look for a battle of fear
for this next election
question
do you remember the
polls that came out after the 2020
election and trump was questioning the
outcome of the election
but then the polls came out and they
asked people
who did you vote for
so that you could match the actual you
know who did you vote for with the vote
totals
and then um
and then the polls
came up with basically the same answer
as as the election itself you remember
that
and therefore prove that the election
was fair
because that's that's sort of an
indirect way to do an audit
that you can you can uh poll people and
find out who they voted for check it
against the actual result they match
boom
so you're done right do you remember
those polls
you remember them right they were all
over the news
no i don't remember them either
i do not remember them
why
why is that
huh
the most important question in the
entire country
huh
and yet there are all these professional
polling companies
who are in the business of gathering
this exact information
interesting
it's exactly what they do for a living
and yet
nobody
decided to check
did that happen
now do you notice that you were all
confused about whether it's happened or
not right i i was kind of gaslighting
you a little bit
were you confused a little bit about
whether or not that actually has
happened or not
now this again is this gets back to the
questions that we're not asking
if i were a news person
every time the question of the election
came up
i would say look it's hard to know
exactly what happened
but these exit polls
support the outcome
or they don't
or they don't i mean i would imagine if
they didn't we'd know more about it
but
i just asked that question
and i might have an answer to
let's see
let me check because i might actually
have the answer to that question i asked
it this morning
um
so there was a rasmussen had a
thread explaining this
very thing
um
those give us the date on this oh this
was in
may so may of this year
the question was asked and rasmussen
dealt with it how about a poll of likely
voters to learn who they actually voted
for
he says great question and we did one in
august of 2021.
and he says first give a little
background
he goes according to
is this interesting by the way
yeah if i'm looking down i can't see the
comments
okay so this is rasmussen actually did a
poll
i think that's where we're going on this
i think that's where this is ending up
um said according to official sources
there were 158 blah blah so he's saying
assuming these totals were accurate this
gives biden a 4.5 win over
trump in the popular vote right
so at the moment we're not talking about
the electoral votes we're just talking
about the popular vote
so if you polled and found that
there was a 4.5 percent difference
between biden and trump
for all of the votes
that would give you some confidence that
the individual states were probably
you know a little bit more likely to be
correct
unless they you know magically cancel
each other out which would be less
likely right
so if if rasmussen pulled people and
found something like a 4.5 gap that
would tell you that the election was
fair and you'd be you'd feel pretty
comfortable with that wouldn't you
wouldn't you
if rasmussen polled and found out that
the people who said they voted one way
or another
roughly matched the actual vote wouldn't
you feel better about that
now i know the electoral is a different
different concept of course
let's see what happened
so in august of 2021 they asked a simple
question who did you who did you vote
for in 2020
and there is also
and the answer was
very close
basically a tie
statistical tie
dead tie
and rasmussen's
commentary at the time was uh what to
make of it we're not yet sure joe biden
beating barack obama's popular vote
tools by this amount of strange belief
i'm not sure about that
because the the argument
that the vote totals
are correct was that the demographics
have changed
the the number of extra votes
roughly matches the number of extra
adults who
voted
i mean basically just it it mirrored the
actual population change in the country
largely
now at least that's the counter argument
has anybody heard a counter to the
counter
because the argument is too many people
voted compared to
prior elections
the counter to that is yes but that
matches the number of extra people who
were
you know
in the country
legally and voted
all right so as far as i know
the number of people who voted is not
the red flag
is it well
let me say it differently it's a flag
it's a flag meaning you need to
understand why
but the explanation for why
sounded pretty good to me
they're just more people in the country
because it's easy to forget that in
eight years you add a lot of people to a
country
like tens of millions of people in eight
years it's a lot of people
so i don't know if that's the full
answer by the way but that was the
the answer
given um
all right so that's the basic idea
so i don't know what other pollsters may
have asked this question
i do know
that
rasmussen typically is pretty close
in their polling before the election
they're one of the closest ones after
the election when when you see how they
did they tend to be one of the best
so i would assume that that
you know level of accuracy
you know can be extrapolated to the
after the election polling
so
so that's sort of a big unexplained
thing isn't it
you know if you were to do this
so here's the other problem with the
doing the
doing the check this way
i wonder how many people forget who they
voted for
you ever wonder about that
it's probably a surprisingly big number
how many people do you think remember
voting and didn't vote
i'll bet it's more than one percent
i'll bet at least one person out of 100
says they voted and didn't vote
but actually might remember that they
did because they're thinking of a prior
election
right
don't you think at least one percent
people have a false memory of voting and
didn't vote at all
how many people answered the question
and had never had any intention of
voting but they like answering questions
[Laughter]
so they just want to answer the poll
uh yeah i'm totally a voter did you vote
in 2020 oh yeah totally totally who'd
you vote for
so
you know there's a lot of human
psychology that goes into knowing
whether to trust these numbers but it's
definitely a flag
it's a gigantic flag that says
maybe we should look into this a little
bit
so here's a question that i asked um
would it be legal
for citizens to put their own security
monitoring video on dropboxes
let's say there was a drop box in your
neighborhood
could you just put your security camera
or your blink camera or whatever the
hell just point it out your window and
see if you can catch any mules
i think it's legal because it's a public
space right
and
you could probably even find the cameras
that
you can
charge and you know it'll last for like
i don't know weeks or whatever so you
wouldn't you know you could actually
just put a temporary camera it just
needs wi-fi
so if you if it's near a starbucks or
something just pick up the wi-fi and
put their trail cams exactly trail cams
that's that's exactly what i was looking
for
they're called trail cams
um
but
but that's the specific question but
here's the more general question
what do you say that our government has
failed
in their job of
let's say
convincing us that the elections are
legitimate
i'm not saying the elections are not
legitimate i'm saying that the job of
convincing us and giving us confidence
they just haven't done it
and here's the question how much could
we do ourselves
so let's let's say you didn't trust
the
rasmussen polling
because
it relies on reaching people and asking
for you know human memory and
so let's say you're uncomfortable with
how accurate that could ever be no
matter how well you did it
let me just suggest something
suppose you created an organization
maybe they have to be selected
maybe they have to be selected
randomly probably
but you had a random really selected
group of people
i'm not sure how you can get the bias
out of this but i think maybe it's
possible if you get the bias out of it
could you create a sample of people who
do vote
remember their vote
and they know they're going to be asked
later
and if you got the right representative
sample
and you did it differently than the
polling companies do because the polling
companies have the
communication channel problem
which is if they're only calling your
wired phone that's just a certain kind
of person if they only call cell phones
that's a different certain kind of
person if they only call on a certain
time of day that's a different
certain kind of person
but if you created if you could do it
create enough people who volunteered and
fit into a
into the model of randomized group
so you'd have to have representatives
from most of the major groups
and let's say you had
i don't know how many people would be
enough
five thousand
a thousand is probably enough
but i feel 5000 would give me a little
more
confidence
now let's say you just looked at 5000 in
the battleground states because the
other ones don't matter at all right so
you made sure your 5 000 were only from
the disputed states or maybe it's 5 000
from each disputed battleground state
whatever the number is to have
confidence
and you say every election
you people are gonna vote
and then we'll just ask you after
you know did you vote to make sure that
you actually showed up
and then
and then we'll compare that random
number of people who is actually well
selected
because you could vet 5000 people
way more thoroughly than you could just
do a poll you know every day
because when you're doing a poll every
day that the amount of checking you can
do to make sure you've got a good random
sample
it's you know naturally limited
but if you could really dig in and find
let's say 500 patriots not 500 5 000. if
i find 5 000 patriots
who don't trust their government and are
willing to be a private check
um
on the election
is there any reason in the world that
that couldn't be
created as just a second way to check
the results
now the problem is that that
organization could be corrupted as well
or they could do their math wrong
and and act like there's
um no the res giving the receipt doesn't
help so here's something that people
don't understand about the election
i believe that by law it has to be
anonymous in other words when the final
vote is in the final database
it can't be paired with a name
so the final vote can never have a name
associated with the vote do you all know
that
because some of your suggestions act
like they you don't understand that part
so your name is associated with your
vote on the physical ballot
but there's a process by which that gets
separated from the vote tallies and it
gets sent without your name associated
right
so i don't believe that a receipt would
ever give you anything
the only way it would give you something
is if the government allowed you to be
their auditor
and said if you sign away your right to
an anonymous ballot
you have to have to sign something says
i give up my right to anonymity
we will track your vote but then you
could game that because then somebody
would just make sure the ones that are
being tracked
match the whatever fraud they did
so that wouldn't help you
at least it wouldn't wouldn't help you
in every situation there would still be
a way around it but maybe maybe it'd
help you a little bit here's my point
i believe that your government isn't
going to fix elections
because they think they benefit by them
being crooked in other words it's the
game they already know how to play they
don't want to change the game to one
they don't know how to play
both sides
both sides
so the republicans want to make sure
they keep the republican
you know districts
democrats want to keep their democrat
districts they don't really want
anything to change right
the last thing they want is to lose
their district
so
we can't really trust the government
to do it for us
so that the larger question is is there
something that citizens can do on their
own
maybe it cost some money but something
outside of the government that would act
as a
type of proxy vote or or
let's say a poor man's audit
just just to know if you're in the
ballpark right
you know i'll tell you again
it doesn't bother me too much
if we had an election there was like
really razor thin margin
and somehow i later found out that you
know there was some cheating that
changed the result
but it was like basically an exact tie
but you know would have gone 100 votes
the other way
i don't care
in terms of the system i don't care i
mean i care about the outcome but i
don't care about the system if the
system gives me a dead tie
uh i feel like the system worked
whichever way i went like you know if
somebody cheated by one vote and it fell
the wrong direction
i don't know is the country worse off
because the
majority of one person was ignored i
don't know
um
erasmus speaking of rasmussen also did a
updated poll on the laptop from hell and
63 of likely u.s voters still think
that's a big deal big story
and a lot of people think that
a big number of people think it changed
the result of the election
so
i saw
molly hemingway say that the fbi had
changed
the last four
presidential elections
does that sound right
that the last four presidential
elections were
you know the thing the fbi had its
finger on the scale
but what's interesting is that you know
once it was
anti-hillary when comey talked about the
emails
once it was you know anti-trump
so
what's going on
i'm not even sure they're all on the
same side
do you ever wonder if what comey did
was trying to help hillary clinton and
it backfired
have you ever considered that
because
he tried to get the news out even though
it was close to the election
it might have been worse if it came out
even closer to the election
because i i think he i think he got it
out in time
to
discount it
you know to to have it just no longer be
a shocking new thing
i don't know it's hard to know what he
had in mind
um oh dan bongino has said this for
years
yeah
yeah i mean it wouldn't make sense it
would the the story would all fit
together then that doesn't mean it's
true but
i you know uh at the time
and i think i have to reassess this at
the time i thought that comey was just
doing it because it had to be done
it was something the country needed to
know
and he thought you know jesus we don't
no he didn't say that but he probably
thought to himself i can't let the
country find out after the election
that we knew all this
so
you know he had an argument for why he
had to put it out but if we assume
they're all political creatures then it
was nothing about the country and it was
everything about
comey's own career i guess
all right
um
biden had a
some kind of a rally or speech
in which he was screeching in his usual
dementia joe way
that
that he had beat pharma
and then everybody cheered
we beat pharma
what
what
now i guess he means
that medicare can negotiate prices
is that it
did it have something to do with the
legislation
pharma didn't like
because i'll give them that
i'll give them that because i think he
did
maybe do something that would be good
for prices
maybe
but if you look at the bigger picture of
uh how many billions they've funneled
into pharma and how much they trusted
them
i don't know that uh they beat pharma so
much as
forma beat the out of us
if you were scoring the fight pharma
versus the citizens of the united states
who do you think got the biggest victory
i don't know
i think it was a technical knockout i
think i think former one
cnn continues to make viewers dumber
and
i it just boggles the mind the cnn
viewers don't know you can't prove a
negative
or at least they act like they don't
know it it's hard to know what they
really believe
but
here's something that could be said
about the 2020 election
that i think would be completely
accurate and without bias it goes like
this
uh we
we have no way to know if the 2020
election was fair or not
but no court has found any evidence that
would say there was you know major fraud
fair
the there is no way to know
that some undiscovery thing didn't
happen because it would be by definition
undiscovered
how do you know what you don't know
there's no way to know the things you
don't know
that's why they're the things you don't
know
the only thing you can say is
we found no evidence
that we could act on
that's fair
but instead here's how cnn says it
um
they they basically say it's a false
claim
that the election was rigged was it is a
false claim
how do they know it's false
they know it can't be proven they know
it wasn't proven they know there's no
evidence that would change the result
they know that no court ruled anything
of any substance
and and i know
that i personally haven't seen anything
that would overturn the election
personally i haven't seen it but can you
say therefore that it's a false claim
you could say it's unproven
but somehow the
the cnn viewers let them get away with
this
i think this is one of these things that
their new ceo needs to
maybe put a little thumb on
because i'm perfectly okay
with cnn saying
that so far all of the claims made about
the election have been
because i told you that was going to be
the case i said at least 95 would be
 and so far
looks at least 95
percent but i feel like cnn just makes
their viewers dumber
by asserting that they know something
didn't happen
just because they don't know if it
happened
uh scott the suppression of laptop most
certainly proves his government what we
know is government involvement
i don't know why you're yelling at me
and caps about that
um any voting security attempt will be
labeled as racist
well everything that republicans do gets
labeled as racist
so there's some guy who owns a lithium
mining company says it won't be enough
lithium for all the electric cars
there is enough apparently there's
enough lithium in the world
but the rate at which they can mine it
is nowhere near fast enough
to get to the number of electric cars
that is the plan
are you worried about that
how worried should you be that an expert
in lithium
says that even though there's enough
lithium in the world the
physical
mining of it you can't wrap it up that
fast it just takes a long time to get a
mind going i guess
so
what do you think about that
here's a reframe for you
i'm going to call it the you could call
this the elon musk reframe
in a way
although
don't blame him for it if you don't like
it
it goes like this
i often imagine that my actual reality
is like a video game
and that i'm in the video game
and
i have a mission or you know some kind
of quest
but i have to find weapons and energy
along the way
i don't know where it's going to be i
have to go find it so i don't know how
to finish the adventure
i only know that there's some chance
that i could find what i need to finish
the adventure
and
i think this is one of those cases
would you say oh let's not have any
aggressive goals for electric cars
because we don't know how to get there
the sort of a loser
approach
we we shouldn't try because as of this
moment we don't know how to get there
because that was true of the moon the
moon shot right
the 1969
moonshot when kennedy said we're going
to the moon he didn't know how
he said we're going to figure out how
this is this to me looks like one of
those cases we don't know how we would
get enough
lithium in time
but all that we'll figure it out
so i'm going to put this on the category
of things i'm not going to worry about
i think we'll figure it out i mean i
don't know how to solve it
now i'm hoping that's true also with
fertilizer
now by the way whether i worry about it
or not won't change
won't change what happens
they should stop pushing electric cars
until we have enough electricity
i don't agree with that i don't agree
in the old days do you remember the old
saying
measure twice cut once
probably you all learned that when you
were a kid
if you ever did a project with a male
parent
probably heard that too many times
measure twice cut once
what does paul graham
who would be one of the premier experts
on startups
what does he say about
measure twice cut once
what would he say about that
he would say that's old thinking
that's sort of pre-internet thinking
we currently have a situation where it's
easier to go out and try something and
see if it works
because the cost of failure is low
especially if it's software
so you can just go out and try a quick
dirty version of something and see if
anybody responds
if nobody responds to the approximate
version that's not quite finished
they're not going to respond to the
finish one either
so you're better off just
pushing ahead and see if you can figure
it out
in in the modern world whereas in the
past where there were more resource
constraints you had to kind of know
in advance
but
let's say
let's say the electric car market starts
heating up
and there's not enough electricity
would naturally happen
well the economist the economist in me
says
that the sources of electricity that
were too expensive before
suddenly become economical
because the demand for electricity would
become so great
the price would go up
and then suddenly the person who didn't
want to build
i don't know the
solar
solar facility or whatever they say oh
now makes sense
because i can charge so much more for
electricity
so i've got a feeling that
um
this is not unusual for leadership
so one of the things that california got
criticized for
and you're gonna hate this
you're going to hate this
some of you might want to just turn off
the live stream before i even say the
next thing i'm going to say you're going
to hate this so much
like you're really going to hate this
newsom is right
newsome's right
to push the electric cars before we have
enough electricity to power them that's
the right play
because he's forcing people to figure
and and the market likes money so he's
creating a situation they can make money
by figuring it out
and i believe they will
i believe they will
yeah now
here i'm drawing on you know years of
management
observation and experience
and here i'm agreeing with the paul
graham version of the world but i don't
want to blame him in case i'm in case
i'm misstating his opinion don't blame
paul graham for anything i say okay just
blame me
um
and i i feel that in the
in the new world you start first and
then figure it out
do you think elon musk knew how to build
a rocket
to get to mars
when he started putting his money into
it no
do you think he knew how to build an
electric car before he built one no
no
do you think he knew how to
put up the
what he called the starlink network of
satellites before he did it
well yeah he'd probably do that one
but by the time he had starlink
i think that one you could just work out
on paper and you know exactly what
you're getting because i think they knew
how to make small satellites
so you really just had to figure out the
rocket part
so
so that one actually you could probably
had a pretty good idea what was going to
work out with that
the car was already electric when elon
joined tesla well it was but it wasn't
marketed and successful i think
and i think elon would say the same
thing in his own words
which is
that
inventing an electric car
was only a part of the process
getting people
to the psychology of wanting to own one
so you could start building on the
economics of volume was the hard part
and so he solved that
by having the coolest
electric car that would go crazy fast
so if you were a car person you'd be
like oh there's a car that goes that
fast
ah i gotta have one
so he worked on the psychology of buyers
in a way that nobody had figured out how
to do
look what the prius did and others they
build the ugliest little car that nobody
wants
to try to get you all to own cars like
that
seriously
that's like completely ignoring
everything you know about human
psychology we're going to make it real
embarrassing to drive this little
you know this little prius
but now and by the way
even with that approach they sold a ton
of priuses the prius was a gigantic hit
but it didn't
it didn't get you all the way to
electric cars
to go all the way to electric cars you
needed the elon magic which is working
on the brain
right so what he invented was a way to
reprogram your brain about electric cars
that's his best invention so far
also making you think that going to the
mars is not only practical
it's not only practical but it's
necessary
can you just think about that
elon musk
persuaded the entire at least the
country
if not the world
that going to mars is both practical
and necessary
that did not exist until elon musk told
us those are both things oh yeah i can
do it and it's absolutely necessary to
you know for human survival that we go
to the stars that is right
he's right
all right
um
how many of you know what the monroe
doctrine is
you all know what the monroe doctrine is
so monroe one of the
founders
had the doctrine that says
you europeans you can't conquer any
countries over in the americas it
doesn't matter if it's
north america or south america or
central america
eu europeans
and at the time they were just thinking
europeans they weren't they weren't
worried about asia
but let's extend that
the point was no foreign country taking
over one of our
american clients if you will because at
the time
i think america felt like it
was sort of dad to everything over here
so we had some some power over them even
though they didn't like it
but putin just put out his putin monroe
doctrine
that basically says that russia
has some kind of responsibility or
rights
to the russian-speaking ethnic russian
people
even if they're in neighboring countries
do you see any problem with that
putin is claiming some responsibility
for other countries
which means
trying to control those other countries
now there's some history to it so it's
not like it's something you just made up
you know russia has always tried to
dominate its neighbors
but
kind of dangerous
it's kind of dangerous
i don't see how this could be more
dangerous
so keep an eye on that
apparently russia has turned off the
nordstream one pipeline completely
and they're basically just trying to
freeze freeze germany
now
is there any history in the world of uh
countries that tried to destroy germany
and then it worked out in the long run
i feel like trying to destroy germany
from a historical perspective
um
that's that's how you get hitler right
now i don't think there's much chance of
germany producing another hitler anytime
soon
but
correct me on my
uh history
but wasn't it the world war one
treatment of a defeated germany
that caused the rise of hitler
or is that more
is that an accurate history or is that
just sort of the
the version the winners gave us
is that accurate
does anybody say that's not accurate
okay
so here we have
russians
basically treating germans in a way that
i feel like germans
let me explain germans for you
because i've got enough of that blood in
me
and i've got some bunch of british and
irish and scotch and welts and
dutch
and german but i think it's about half
german
and
uh
germans are the most helpful
friendly
give you the shirt off your back
kind of people you could ever have
until you really piss them off
am i right
sure enough they're back
they will help you so fast
anything you want
i remember this story uh
when i first moved to san francisco i
had this
tiny little um
like in-law apartment that only had one
room and a bathroom basically
and
my
landlord who lived in the the larger
building above
he was a german immigrant
and
he had the very german attitude and one
day i told him that i had
rented a
dumpster
and i just wanted to inform him that it
would be you know parked outside for a
day or two because i had some
garbage to get rid of and i had a lot of
it
and i said hey i'm only going to use
part of this dumpster so if you'd like
if you have any stuff just throw it in
the dumpster too
and you know it's free
i already paid for it
do you know what my german-born
landlord
his response to that just take a guess
what was his response to me offering him
a free
service that he wanted like he wanted
the service he had stuff to throw
he couldn't handle the fact that i was
paying for it
couldn't handle it
because he had a lot of money and he
knew i could barely afford my apartment
and so for me to barely afford my
apartment and pay for something for him
couldn't handle it could not handle it
but
i'm half german too
so
so we did a lot of this
i i don't even remember how we how we
finally uh resolved it but we we got in
a fight about not a real fight but but
you know a disagreement about who is
going to be nicer to the other
all right
now that that was such a german
interaction
such a german interaction
and so i'm watching russia
say say to germany hey germany
what are you going to do if i poke you
if i poke you
nothing i will watch the poke a little
more
how about that
oh you're complaining a little bit
you're complaining a little bit that's
nothing that poke you a little bit
poke you
there is a point
let me explain to you
there's a point at which
germans stop being friendly
you don't want to reach that point
you really really don't want to reach
that point
and putin's getting pretty close
now again i i think the modern view of
germany is that it's like a it's like a
big puppy dog that's been defanged
right you know they're not going to
cause any trouble because of their
history
well but who has pissed them off this
much before
right now maybe they say we brought it
on ourselves to some extent or something
but
i would be really careful
about how hard you pushed germany i'd be
really careful about that because that
could sneak up on you
i guess russia is buying iranian drones
and millions of north korean artillery
shells
now
is that
foreshadowing
all right so
so what europe is going to be lacking
will be energy
but at least energy can be produced in
different ways and you know
i think they'll survive the winter
and then there'll be enough time to
start adjusting
and getting other sources
but
if you see russia trying to operate
without modern technology they don't
have chips and they can't trade to get
the good stuff anymore if they have to
rely on iranian drones which have been
pretty sketchy
and i don't know what the quality of
north korean artillery shells is
but
doesn't that tell you they're in a lot
of trouble
now the the news from ukraine which is
completely not credible by the way
anything that comes out of ukraine is
not to be believed but the news that
they're telling
is that they're counter-offensive and
curse on or wherever
is you know having small gains you know
they're degrading the russians and
getting ready to make some move there
now i don't know if any of that's true
that would be the least credible yet
that's the least credible thing that
comes out of a war zone is our team's
winning
i'm pretty sure the russians think
they're winning too
but i'm surprised we got to this point
where what we're talking about is the
ukrainian counter-attack
when was the last time somebody said
russia has gained more territory
how long has it been since russia gained
territory
i i feel like there's a momentum shift
right now i think i think that the
counter-attack might be a little bit
fake
meaning that zielenski is so good at
managing public opinion
that once the news of russian
territorial gains stopped he needed a
counter narrative to say oh
if this if it's not going to be in the
news that russia is winning we better
create some news that we're winning
and people will give us more money
because it looks like we're winning so
mostly i think the counter-attack is a
fundraising
technique
i don't know that zelinski thinks he can
recapture anything
i think he just says hey we're making
progress give us more money we'll make
some more progress so it just looks like
fundraising to me
surprisingly
a poll of a european opinion of the
ukraine situation
is that uh they're very supportive
of the
economic sanctions on russia
which means that they won't have energy
themselves
meaning it'll be too expensive for a lot
of them
but seven out of ten uh in the eu are in
favor of uh
um military supplies to ukraine
and 78 of citizens um
support the sanctions against russia i
mean that is really strong support
that is really strong sport
so
if you have that much support
it looks like the europeans have decided
that russia is not going to
kill them
they're going to take whatever level of
let's say inconvenience and discomfort
it requires
have ever
of course i have told you the difference
between wanting something and deciding
it's one of those critical differences
because once you once you detect in
somebody a decision
you can predict that they will succeed
but if you only see them having a strong
desire for something
could go either way
decision is really predictive
and it looks to me like the europeans
made a decision
am i wrong i saw some people are from
europe watching all right if there any i
know there are but the europeans who are
watching right now
would you say that europe has decided
that they're going to power through this
and they're going to take putin down by
forever taking him out of the pipeline
right
so if you're from europe
identify yourself
massive protest in the czech republic
yep
yep
you're from europe but what's your
opinion
massive protests
yeah
but is it safe to say that europe
doesn't just want
you know putin to do poorly it looks
like they've decided they've just
decided that he's not going to have that
market anymore
i think you can now predict how that
goes
i think you can predict that putin's
withdrawal of energy will not have the
political impact he hopes
it looks like europe decided
because you don't see that much
agreement about
pretty much anything
all right
and uh
that
is the exciting show for today
lots of suffering from many winters i
don't know i think this is a two winter
situation
i don't think it's a many winter
situation i think it's a two winter
but i'm not positive about that
we'll see
yeah i i think i think that our ability
to adjust
to big shocks
is about a two-year
these days we're just so good at
adjusting
everyone says i can take the pain until
the pain starts well that's true
will the usa help
i don't know just
printing
unlimited money
yeah we need uh mass production of micro
uh processors i think elon's money is
infusion though
i might be wrong about that but i think
elon is
he's a generation ahead
where you expect him to be i guess
six million elderly germans live alone
you know the number of people living
alone
is really a gigantic problem
you know there's a trend of seniors
living with uh college students have you
heard that
you know like one senior and one college
student because they you know the the
senior can provide the cheap housing
and the and the kid the young person can
provide some services and stuff
and to me that's the best i've actually
considered that model i was actually
thinking of getting a
getting a college
college student roommate
just just to have somebody around who
has a different set of
you know skills and schedule than i do
because you know my problem is the only
way that anybody would know if i died in
my house
was if i didn't do the live stream for
two days in a row
if i missed it once
you know you might just think i had a
sick day but if i missed it twice you
know they'd probably do a health check
at my house
all right
i need to run
got to do something and i will talk to
you later bye for now
