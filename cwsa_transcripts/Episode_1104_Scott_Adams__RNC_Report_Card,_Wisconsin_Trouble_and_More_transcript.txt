hey everybody
come on in it's time it's time for us
coffee with scott adams and
what a day it is it's just like other
days
except it's better because of the
simultaneous sip that's going to come at
you
it's coming at you soon coming at you
hard and all you need is
what do you need you know what you need
come on you know what you need it's a
copper mug or glass a
tanker jealous or stein a canteen
jug or a flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i kind
of like my coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zip and it happens now
go
yeah i can feel biden's poll numbers
falling we took one step
well there's a lot of stuff going on
let's jump right into it are you ready
yeah we'll talk about wisconsin in a
moment we'll let a few more people
get in here one thing i didn't see
coming
is that the government the trump
administration has declared
the fentanyl dealer in china the big
fentanyl dealer whose
name we know weirdly we know who he is
he's the big fentanyl dealer who sends
the fentanyl to the united states and
kills our citizens
and they've designated it a foreign
national
what is the word foreign national no
foreign narcotics kingpin
designation which allows them to
sanction
anything that this guy's attached to so
this guy's other entity will be starting
to get
squeezed at this point good keeps the
pressure on
so the big news of course there's a
tragic shooting in kenosha wisconsin
you've probably caught the news by now
but a
young man was he 18 years old was
allegedly part of the boogaloo boys or
maybe not or maybe he was just there as
a local protecting businesses from
looters
it's all fog of war right now so i think
we should
hold off on who he was and why he was
there
but of course social media has decided
he's a white supremacist
is he a white supremacist uh so far
those claims
have come with no evidence of such a
thing
anything's possible but remember nick
sandman
if you're gonna call this guy a white
supremacist you better come with some
evidence
because i think nick sandman showed that
it's a bad idea
to start labeling people based on your
first
impression so uh
i think i've been telling you for some
time that the obvious
way that these protest riots slash
looting episodes were going to go is
there was only one way this was going to
go
under the assumption that the police
would not get more aggressive
which seemed likely
and that the local government would not
let the federal government come in and
take care of the the the violent stuff
so given that there was going to be no
adult supervision
and that was intentional that the
the local the local leadership decided
to
not have uh any kind of
adult leadership during the protest
riots slash looting so it was obvious
that the locals
would end up arming themselves because
what else would happen i mean really can
you think of
any other outcome it's it's obvious that
this had to happen
but what's more obvious is that this is
the beginning not the
you know not the the one-off it's pretty
obvious
that more militia are gonna and maybe
just more citizens
are going to bring heavier arms
a heavier meaning more than a pistol and
they're going to start showing up now
how often will this turn into
an event like this more there will be
more of it
and unfortunately there's probably no
other way it's going to stop
now you could get the worst case
scenario which is that the protesters
also arm now if the protesters arm and
obviously some of them
a lot of them actually are armed but so
far they haven't
they haven't uh you know started using
it in terms of the
as a protest so you might see a whole
different level
in coming nights of who's armed and
who's willing to
use those arms but ultimately this is
the way i had to go
so i feel bad for anybody who gets hurt
i don't encourage any violence against
anybody
but as a prediction there's only one way
this can go
and it won't go forever it will end
with more of this uh the only other way
we could get an
off ramp as if this or maybe there's
some
you know violence after this that's sort
of a copycat
usually you can count on the copycat
stuff so the
it's an easy prediction that there'll be
more more that looks a lot like
last night with the so there was a
young white guy unfortunately it matters
that he's white
because that's the state of things uh
shot three people i think two of them
may have passed
and he may have been there to protect
against looting
it looks like there's a video of the
police being friendly with him and
actually thanking him for his help
so i think the police believed he was
there just as an armed
an armed citizen and
as long as he wasn't pointing his gun
into people i guess the police were okay
with that
i don't think they're okay now somebody
says one died
so remember it's fog of war everything
you hear about this
is going to be um unlikely to be true
so wait you know wait at least 48 hours
before you
you're sure of anything that happened
out of this event
so i think that there is now
a an exit meaning that
you can now see where the end of it is
which is it's going to be more of this
and that will in turn cause people to
get a little bit more serious about it
and either the law enforcement or the
federal government will come in and end
it
or or the the locals will end it it's
possible the locals will just
do more of this and it'll just become
more of a tragedy
all right uh let's talk about something
else because that's pretty
pretty dark so there's something that
happened
at cnn this week and mostly last night
and if you didn't catch it it's the most
mind-boggling thing you've ever seen in
your life
cnn has made some kind of an
editorial decision to change the way
they're framing things
somewhat suddenly or it's a coincidence
or or it's temporary it might be
temporary
but last night cnn almost became
republican and i didn't know what i was
saying that they completely left their
their crazy frame of everything orange
man does is bad and everything
everything the left does is good they
pretty much reversed it last night
if you watched the coverage cnn was
saying in in fairly
unambiguous language that the rnc knight
2
was really good now a lot of it had to
do with the fact
that the rnc um very
strategically let's say made sure that
they hit
all the right notes for identity
politics
so they really did a great job of
featuring these successful women
in the trump campaign which is actually
a really it's
it's a strong spot that they have not
really emphasized
until now so if you were if you were a
cnn viewer
or let's say a democrat you you were
watching the
rnc you probably didn't know what you
were seeing
because you'd see all these successful
black republicans talking about things
and you'd say
i didn't know there were black
republicans
of course nobody says that exactly but
you understand the hyperbole
just turning it on and watching the
republicans
create a program that involved lots of
republicans deciding what's the best
thing to do for
republicans and for the country
presumably and they decided that the
best
thing to do was to show lots of support
for every disadvantaged group
every marginalized group and they put on
quite a show
and i would say that they basically took
all the ammo away from cnn cnn
would love to have criticized them for
not doing enough
for women not highlighting you know
black
issues but they had a all
and they hit them hard and uh so even
even david axelrod was saying okay gotta
give it to him that was a really good
production
in terms of a political production it
was extraordinarily well done
so i'd say the rnc has now nailed it two
in a row
like really really well some of the
highlights if you didn't watch it
nick sandman did his little speech about
his situation
i thought he did really well i wasn't
expecting much
just because of his age you know if you
see somebody that age
and you say okay you're going to be on
you know the biggest
the biggest stage in the world and we're
not going to give you any practice
it's just your first day how about
giving your first speech ever and it'll
be to the entire world
and he nailed it if he didn't watch it
he's an impressive kid meaning that he's
got some game
and he actually nailed it now of course
the
the the i guess the punctuation
to his little speech was when he put on
his
baggy hat which was quite a cool moment
i gotta say
it was a good moment before that
uh and uh the president really hit the
the uh
all the right emotional feels a number
of times
uh i i caught the uh the show late so i
had to catch up on
his pardon of uh
john ponder so i guess john ponder
didn't know
that he was there to get pardoned now he
was all he's out of prison so the pardon
i guess does what does it take away his
record i don't know the details of it
but he was uh john ponder had been
convicted at one point and now he had
he'd been active in the community
helping people who were trying to
transition back from prison to life
to regular life and apparently he was
very successful at it
so uh watching him and being best
friends with the police officer
that is just a plus imagery i mean
the there was a lot of genius in that
production
this is not normal if if you really
studied how well
the rnc pulled this together the first
two nights
it's extraordinary it's this is not
normal work
you're seeing the best of the best in a
very short time pull together
something that's really impressive and
to create that moment where john ponder
found out
on on film i don't know if it was live
or it was on film
probably live but uh um
but watching his expression as he found
out that he was there to get pardoned
was extraordinary you have to watch it
it's totally worth watching the clip
just to watch that moment i didn't think
it would be as powerful as it was but
it's really powerful
then some other stars i guess it's david
cameron the
african-american attorney general of
kentucky
as even i think even cnn called it his
star turn and i'm thinking what am i
watching
they actually gave him a full just an
a-plus
what he's republican and cnn just said
a plus and i'm waiting for the and
and he killed the baby you know and he
murdered a person
nothing just a plus
star turn he might be like a rising star
black man in the
uh in the republican party
and he wasn't the only one people were
also talking about tim scott
as being you know maybe auditioning for
2024 to run for president
as republican another african-american
man who's
clearly in line for a good shot at the
presidency
as a republican pretty good
uh so it would have been hard for the
cnn to criticize this thing but let me
give you some other high points
all right now obviously the this
convention stuff is all
um it's all tricks right it's all
staged theatrical it's it's a little bit
heavy-handed as in hey look at our
you know black people who are doing well
look at our women who are doing well
and yeah excuse me
i'll be right back
i'm live to the world right now
sorry i have to take a look take care of
a little business
and i'll get right back to you hold on a
second here just hold on a second
all right thanks
all right i'm back um
so what was i talking about uh
so anyway uh cnn love this thing here's
my favorite part
now if you're looking for how well it
was produced
there are moments um i was talking
about tim scott so the republican party
showed legitimately at least
two black men in the republican party
who you would say
you look at him for five minutes and you
say yeah i could see them as president
i could totally see them as president
that's very powerful
yeah bad midler somebody says bette
midler she was freaking out
and said bad things about melania all
right let's talk about melania
um cnn was
praising her republicans are praising
her
one of the most successful speeches
you're ever going to see i think
president trump
is really happy about her today and if
he's not
he needs to he needs to be because she
nailed it
now there's something about melania that
um is you know different different than
any politician because she's
mostly about bringing the empathy and
the caring and stuff
and because she did a good job on the
empathy and caring part
that does um that does sort of cross
over to her husband
in other words uh you have a hard time
imagining
that first of all melania seems totally
genuine you know all of the the caring
and the empathy for melania i think
everybody agrees that's real
nobody thinks that's not real and
and then you say to yourself well she
married this guy
who we don't think is so empathetic
right
but maybe he is because it certainly
is certainly confuses things doesn't it
so i think that she did a great job of
humanizing the president
and showing that you know at least his
team has
empathy and one assumes that he's got
some of that too
just by association but here's my
favorite part
if you saw the beginning part where she
did the long
tracking walk on the way to the podium
that was genius and here's why it's
genius
most people can't walk and by that i
mean
could you imagine anybody else who they
would give a long tracking shot to so
you see them walking toward the camera
but for a long ways
it wasn't just like you know here's a
shot and then cut away
they made a deal of showing her as a
tiny
you know a tiny distant figure and then
walking toward the camera
and what was genius about this is you
could
you could pick a thousand people who
couldn't
walk the way she walks because she's a
trained
uh model so when she walks
it's literally professional walking i
don't know if i don't know if you
were like catching it at the time but
whoever had the genius
to catch the professional walking before
she actually did the speech
that's that's beyond good work
that's like next level stuff because not
only did it give you a sense of distance
because this is the other thing you did
if you're watching these televised
things without audiences or without much
of an audience
they can look flat but think of the
dimensionality you got
when they did this long shot down the
the sidewalk and you saw a tiny melania
who let's be honest the audience was
waiting for her right
she was you knew she was going to be one
of the highlights
and people were interested because even
if they didn't like the president
they kind of are interested in melania
she's just interesting
in a lot of different ways so to
to have that you know just beautiful
walk-up introduction
give give some depth to the viewer
uh it was just smart just smart
yeah and of course you know everybody
will talk better outfit and
uh all that so it gives them lots to
talk about that's not not too serious
and maybe we needed that
so the the critics were completely out
of
ammo and they were they're starting to
complain about the hatch
act which says you can't use the white
house
or i don't know maybe it's maybe it's
all federal property i'm not sure
but you can't use the white house for
political stuff
unless you're the president now of
course the president can do it
which makes sense it's not like anybody
knows he's not the president
so why not do it there but are you going
to apply that to melania
i don't know if the hatch act applies to
her as first lady
she's not elected so maybe she's exempt
but they tried to say i was watching joy
read i think
say that chad wolf
who is what is he he did the immigration
ceremony thing they're saying that the
hatch act was violated because
he did his little thing swearing in
citizens
and i'm thinking oh my god trump did it
again
he lured them into criticizing the most
unimportant thing there were that
happened in the entire country
there is nothing less important nothing
if you made the longest list you could
of the problems the united states
you would be down to like problem number
10 000
before the problem of chad wolf talked
for 60 seconds
in a building he wasn't supposed to be
in while he was standing next to the
president
who is completely allowed to do a
political act
now is it a political act that he swore
in
five or six new citizens
i don't know is that a political act
would you consider it a political act
per se to see somebody sworn in as a
citizen
i don't know if you're going to make a
complaint about that
that is the smallest smallest little
pico problem in the united states yeah
technically
is is joy reid technically right i don't
know
do you care do you care
no so trump once again tricked them into
talking about the
only thing no audience cares about
that even even msnbc was probably saying
uh seriously really
you're completely out of ammo so your
complaint was that
chad wolf did his job
because i think swearing in people's
probably in in the domain of his job
that's pretty small complaint so you're
doing great but let's talk about the you
swear again
as uh as anderson cooper noted and it
was a great moment of cnn tv
i i hope you saw it live because
anderson
cooper said that watching the presidents
wear in these
uh these new citizens who had come from
a variety of countries
the anderson cooper actually went there
and he said it looks like they were
selected to be from the quote
 countries and i thought to
myself did you really say that
did you really say that these people
you know even though he's obviously
trying to quote president trump
from long ago are you really you're
really tying these
these six people who just want to be
citizens
they just they just want to be good
people be good to the kids
have good families contribute to our
country
they just they just want to be citizens
and anderson cooper drags them into this
 country conversation
you know i will admit that the president
probably was trying to counter
you know that story i mean that does
seem somewhat obvious
but here's the fun part and then the
anderson cooper says
it seemed i don't know where to use
jarring or discordant or two of the
words that i heard last night
it seemed jarring because on one hand
the president had said a bad thing about
the countries that
i don't know if any of them were from
those countries which is part of what's
bad about what anderson said
but he said it was jarring that the
president would say bad things about it
and then he would act so nice
to people from you know at least
countries and
in that class if you will of not the
not the superpowers and i thought to
myself
anderson cooper why is this jarring to
you
was he unaware that the president
is my microphone not good is
is the president unaware i'm sorry is
anderson cooper
unaware that the president has always
been
100 percent in inter in favor of
legal immigration is it the first time
cnn is finding out
that the president of the united states
favors
legal immigration because
i don't think there was any discord
there i don't think there was anything
that was in conflict there
and the fact that he thought so was just
mind-blowing because
only cnn and you know the fake news
made a fake story out of this and so his
own fake story
wasn't matching with his own observation
and he was trying to understand why his
own fake news didn't match his
observation
on live tv it was a great moment
yeah it was a small movement but it was
great
all right um was one of the best lines
of
the night that made me just go what
was uh david cameron the a.g from
kentucky
who referred to biden as a backwards
thinker
that's really good i don't know if
anybody helps him with his speeches you
assume that anybody who gives a speech
at the
at the at a big convention probably has
professionals
who are are helping with the uh with
everything
so i might have been unprofessional
helped him with that but that's a great
great line against biden a backwards
thinker as opposed to someone who's
focused on the future that was good
stuff
um let me just say about the
naturalization ceremony
um i i am very cynical and
jaded and you know all those things
as many of you are but there's one thing
that gets me
every time i cannot watch
people swearing in to become new members
of the united states
new citizens i can't watch that ceremony
without just crying
every time it doesn't matter last night
yes
but i've seen you know other videos i've
seen videos of people i know who are
going through that process
and i gotta say if let me put it this
way
if a revolution happened tomorrow
and you wanted to and let's say
something happened that burned all of
the books
and something destroyed the internet so
we lost
all of our records of civilization we
lost
you know all of our structure the
government was overthrown and we lost
everything and you wanted to build it
back
what would be the the one thing you'd
need to retain
to be able to build it back the only
thing
that everything else could be built back
if you just kept that one thing
and that's what you saw with that
naturalization ceremony
that that's the thing
the fact that that can happen that those
people
those excellent citizens
would come to this country and would buy
into
not just you know the real estate you
know they weren't saying we came to the
united states because it has good real
estate
they weren't saying that they were
buying into
the the idea so
here's the thing no matter how bad
things are
no matter riots in the street no matter
fake news no matter wars
no matter coronavirus no matter
unemployment no matter
bad words on the internet as long
as long as that one thing
works as long as we keep that one thing
we can get back everything else
so um
so i'm a big baby and i have to admit um
that that touched me
so um
[Music]
there's one funny thing uh yesterday i
was joking i have to say something funny
because i have to get in a different
mood here for a moment
i was i was uh telling you about all the
weird coincidences between the biden
campaign and satanism
now i'm not a believer so i don't
believe there's a real satan
but it is humorous how many coincidences
there are
that you could find let's call it
confirmation bias but there are lots of
coincidences you can find once you're
looking for them
which is really the lesson in this is
that once you're looking for them
they're everywhere
and after i did that somebody told me
that
kamala harris's middle name wait for
this
wait for this you you're going to be
glad you heard this
you ready kamala harris's middle name
is devi d-e-v-i
the only thing that's missing to turn
her middle name
into literally devil
is an l and you know what's funny about
that
oh that's funny already but you know
what's really funny about that
kamala harris the only thing she needs
is an l
and trump's going to give it to her
she's going to get the l she's not going
to get the w
so did the did the simulation just
serve up to us her middle name is devi
and all she needs is an l and trump's
gonna give her the l
i mean come on is any of this real
is this a real world it couldn't
possibly be
this is so obviously scripted at this
point you couldn't possibly believe this
is anything but a simulation
all right here's my prediction are you
ready
i understand that uh trump not only
i'm sorry that uh when biden did his uh
convention thing there biden got no
bounce
there was no biden bounce apparently if
you live in the basement you don't get
much of a bounce
do you think there'll be a bounce from
the rnc
oh yeah oh yeah
just just wait for the next poll
now i don't want to say that i'm psychic
because that's not what's happening
in this particular case but
you might get some laughs when you see
the next poll
all right somebody's telling me that
kamala means different things
that means horrible and finnish and
and somebody said that lucifer means uh
the bringer of light
which is literally what biden is
claiming biden
says he'll bring us light somebody said
that that's what lucifer means
actually the bringer of light i don't
know if that's true but somebody said it
all right come on man uh i'm gonna eat
my breakfast
that's all for now and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
