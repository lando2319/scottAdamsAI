[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight
of not only american history but
civilization itself
for those of you outside the united
states
today is the fourth of july we'll talk
about that
special day here
i don't know if you've even even heard
of it
but
uh or for that matter
what could be less important
than the holidays in the country that
where you don't live probably nothing
that's probably the least important
thing that ever happened to you but
we're going to make this special anyway
and all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tanker jealousy stein a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day things makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous symptom
it's going to happen right now go
i have been waiting for this and it was
as good as i imagined
well you know that story about the
so-called patriot front
the khaki wearing
young
males who all look like they came out of
the same printing press
and they're apparently
associated with a way super
they're being called a white supremacist
group
and they marched through downtown boston
carrying police shields and flags and
burying the bearing the group's emblem
now what was it they were protesting for
or against anybody
anybody
they were protesting for
what
they were protesting against
what
nothing
they coincidentally were protesting for
or against nothing and appeared just at
the time
that the democrats are telling you
gosh these republicans like to get
together and march on things and conquer
them because that's what the january 6
hearings are
is it a coincidence
that the group you most imagine had is
well named
the repatriate
front
yeah that's right
they're a front
for something
don't know what
but they call themselves a front for
something
so they appear at exactly the time that
their appearance would be most
associated somewhat automatically in
your mind
with republicans trying to conquer their
republic by marching on the capital
coincidence
is it a coincidence that they have no
cause
and they're marching
have you ever said to yourself
hey let's get together
because nothing's happening and go and
go have a march
do you ever remember doing that
ah we're so we're so calm today
there's nothing going on let's get
together and all wear the same clothes
and put on masks and march in a foreign
city where it costs us money in our time
why
why'd they do that
was it a recruiting effort
and
so here's the weird thing
i'm reading the news and i looked at you
know
left right and axios there's somewhat in
the middle
and
they all cover this story the same way
they just tell you what happened
what's missing in the story
what's missing in the story is who are
they why were they there
did anybody talk to them and say hey hey
why today
why today well like what's happening are
you protesting for or against abortion
rulings
what
so they can't find their leader and they
can't get a quote from the patriot front
really there's nobody who can get a
quote
from their leader saying why were you
there marching nobody
what the hell is going on
there's something so ridiculous about
this whole thing and i don't know what
it is i mean
you know we like to joke that they're
all feds
but i don't know i mean that's just one
of several possibilities it seems at
least as likely that it's just a
democrat
operation
or it's a foreign intelligence operation
and when i say foreign intelligence
operation it doesn't mean that they're
from other countries
it means that all you need is enough
money to bribe a leader
and you can have any kind of grassroots
movement you want so you only have to
convince the leaders you don't have to
convince the people
buy off a leader you got yourself a
protest
i don't know if that's what happened but
since nobody's asking i guess we have to
guess
so you have to read an article i don't
do this often
but there will be a signed reading
it's only because it's so good it's good
on two levels
one the story is amazing it's not too
long only take you a few minutes
and the writing is excellent
so you you i recommend it if you just
like good writing just to see what nice
clear sentences
and clean thinking looks like
and it's a sub stack article by mark
hyman h-y-m-a-n
and i think it's free to subscribe if
you want to see the rest of the
subscript sub-stack
but he's got a story about the uh the
pulitzer
honoring you know the new york times and
the washington post
for
uh they're reporting about the
russia collusion
and the nature of the story is that
basically the pulitzer is a way to
launder fake news
now that's not the way mark says it
that's that's my interpretation of his
his better article so read it in his
words you have to see it stated well my
own bad description of it
is that the pulitzer is basically
a fig leaf
for
making you think that reporting is valid
when maybe it wasn't so much
and at this point we know that the new
york times and the washington post won
pulitzer prizes
for being duped
about the biggest story of the country
for being duped completely fooled
about what was really going on in the
context
that at least 30 percent of the country
didn't need to do any research at all
and and here's here's 30 of the country
roughly
doing as much research as the people who
won
nobel or not nobel police surprises
i give you now my impression
of 30 of the regular public
analyzing the
russia collusion charges
uh
i don't think so
nope
nope
i'm not going to do a deep dive on this
one
because that one is sort of
obvious
yeah there are all kinds of flavors of
 i'm sure you've tasted them all
you got your subtle your slight
 you got your hyperbole
you've got all manner of
massaging the facts and misleading and
leaving out context oh there's
in every form
but
you've never seen bigger
than the russia collusion story now am i
wrong that 30 of the public spotted it
from the jump
right
i mean i did
i'm not sure what exactly i was saying
at the time but as soon as it came out i
said to myself
no
no i don't believe that trump
who is a germaphobe
urinated on a hotel bed with a hooker or
asked a hooker to urinate out of bed for
any reason for any reason
as soon as i looked at i was like
no
that does not look like that's true
all right
now i have to admit that i did not
therefore go all the way to hillary
clinton
paid for it um
my brain did not go there on day one i
could just tell that it was fake news
by the nature of it you just listened to
it you go i don't think so and by the
way
i'm pretty sure i would have spotted
this
had the parties been reversed
meaning that if the republicans had you
know
accused biden of the same thing i would
have said you know
i mean just without even doing any
research
i don't think so i just don't think so
i think i would have spotted it in
either direction
all right
um
so the pulitzer is not a credible
organization and you hear somebody got
one you should not be impressed
i say this because i've always wanted to
win a pulitzer prize and never have
so if you'd like to get your commentary
from somebody who is clearly disgruntled
this guy
why is two thumbs and is disgruntled
about not winning a pulitzer prize
this guy
yes i'm very bitter about it
i'm bitter about winning the prize that
i have no i put no value in whatsoever
it's true by the way i am actually
bitter about it
i swear to god i'm bitter about it and
the reason is the other cartoonists have
won the pulitzer
so gary chujos won once or twice
and uh i think brook breath is one and
then lots of uh
you know political cartoonists have one
and i always said to myself
i feel as if
dilbert has defined the workplace in a
way that
if somebody deserved a pulitzer prize
for cartooning you know for commentary
about
the world and even having an effect on
the actual workplace
honestly
with complete humility
i deserve a pulitzer prize
just based on how they're given and what
they're for and
the context
and
um
but i don't think i've been nominated
so you can't actually win it unless
you're nominated i think you nominate
yourself
so
no i'm not high but thanks for asking
so somewhere halfway halfway into my
live stream pretty much every day
or no matter what time of day somebody
says
i think he's high
now if you think that
now somebody says gary larson is 100
times better and i agree but you're off
point
you're off point
calvin hobbs is also the best
cartoon that's ever been made in my
opinion but calvin hobbs doesn't get a
pulitzer
because the the commentary is not
serious about the world right dilbert is
actually serious commentary in
in humorous form
so you have to at least be political or
social in nature before a polisher is
applicable right
yeah so
um i feel like
i'm in that domain
all right
here's an interesting factoid a little
positivity for you
um
so because of the uh row decision by the
court people are asking ridiculous
questions about other things
and one of the ridiculous questions is
will the supreme court somehow make it
illegal
to have uh interracial marriage
now
there are some predictions i make
that
i'm like oh i'm really like 90 percent
sure i'm not 100 sure but this is the
only one where i'm going to go out on
the limb and say 100 sure
interracial marriage will remain legal
in the united states does anybody want
to argue that point
i'm a hundred percent sure it's not a
problem
anybody
talk about a revolution
oh my god
there's there's probably not a single
thing that we've ever discussed
that would be more volatile than that
all right now i live in california
if if i hosted a party at my house and
just you know invited 100 people
that i know from my social circle or
whatever
there would be so many interracial
marriages
now i live in california so maybe
there's just more of it but i almost
don't see the other kind
where i live it's mostly interracial now
interracial depends how you define it
right
so we're we're not counting just black
and white you've got to count
you know hispanic you've got to count
asian you've got to count everything
right so
interracial marriages where i live
i don't know
like
it is so far beyond anything you could
ever reverse
just just no way
defined racial yeah
so everybody might define it a little
bit differently
but here's the point i was going to say
there's a there's this scientific
let's say idea that has been confirmed
by studies
of course we don't believe studies are
necessarily true unless they agree with
our biases and this one does so i'm
going to say it's good
somebody says law pleasant and is not
mostly interracial
i'm going to disagree with you i'm going
to disagree with you because i said if i
threw a party of my social circle
i didn't say you know a generic
pleasanton event but i don't think you
could have a generic pleasant event that
wasn't just full of at least
you know asian american
plus others hispanic american
plus others
you know there's less black white where
i live but the interracial part
is pervasive
i i think whoever just said that
pleasanton doesn't have interracial
marriages i think you're discounting how
many
different groups are because if you
throw in indian-americans you know
people born in india or not
who is very high
interracial marriage very high
in a good way
so the idea is that proximity makes
people less
bigoted
in other words if you simply spend time
around people
instead of disliking them more because
you know you get to see all their warts
or whatever
it's the opposite the more time you
spend with people who are different from
you the more accepting you are does that
make sense to you
do you believe that i mean does that
study sound like that makes sense now
some of the
the examples they gave i thought were
and i'll tell you why one of the
examples was that people who served in
back when the military were segregated
there was a period when there were still
segregated units
and then integrated units and if you
followed up with them you found that the
the integrated units uh years later the
people who were in it were less bigoted
than the people who were never
integrated in the first place does that
make sense and so that was part of the
evidence of that working together makes
you less bigoted
do you see any problem with that study
there's a big problem with that study
isn't it
well let me ask you at a time when there
was a transit transition
and there were still
segregated units and unsegregate and
then you know integrated units do you
think there was anything that those
units had in common
before the study
almost certainly
the ones that were integrated first
were in places where they thought it
would work
right
i'm just guessing
that the units that perhaps were made up
of or comprised of more you know old
southern boys so to speak
i've got a feeling that they didn't
integrate right away
like maybe they needed to wait to see if
every if the northern units
worked it out and once they did you know
everybody could do it but i have a
feeling that
the ones who decided to integrate first
had something in common
in other words it was a group of people
where you said to yourself well that
could work with that group
but i'll bet there were other groups
yeah i bet there were other groups
uh where they just said okay let's wait
on this group because these are all just
severe racists in this group so i'm not
sure i believe the study
do you but it but
but it also attracts
with my own
understanding
meaning that
i would say that's true i would say that
exposure makes you more open to other
people would you disagree with that
is anybody who would disagree with that
just sort of common sensically or does
your own experience say yeah the more
time you spend with other people the
more
accepting you are
now i'm almost positive
that this is that that proximity thing
is why i'm so much more pro-immigration
than a lot of you are
i'm almost positive because i have a
proximity thing going on
if you take the people coming across the
border illegally or people who have and
have you know recently you know maybe
it's the second generation whatever if
you take that group
as a class
i've had you know extensive extensive
exposure to them because of where i live
and
my opinion is they're better than the
people who are already here
[Laughter]
sorry
[Laughter]
now when i say better
i don't mean you know
smarter taller better as sports i don't
mean their dna is better or anything
like that not not in some way that you
should care about i don't think they're
better
here's how i think they're better
i just love the fact
that they beat the odds that they they
took on something
enormously risky and dangerous
to get to the united states to better
their lives
in in my opinion i know how distasteful
this is for some of you
some of you are just going to hate this
especially on the 4th of july
but to be america is not a border
we have to have a border and i'm i'm big
on having you know strong borders and
protecting them so
separate the fact that i think
functionally you have to have a strong
border more more strong than we have now
but
i think america is a way of
a way of thinking
i think america is a vibe
i think america is a point of view
and the the people who come here
illegally not all of them i mean they
all come for their own reasons but to me
they come with more of an american vibe
than the people who are already here and
just were born into it and didn't work
for it
now that's just a bias right
could i prove it if i did a study would
it be backed up i don't know i have no
idea is it is a complete bias
that is informed by proximity
if you spend enough time around the
people who came from
below the border recently
you will love them
that's my opinion if you spend enough
time around anybody who came across the
border
you could have a really good opinion of
them
and it will definitely influence what
you think about how tough we should be
in sending people back or amnesty or all
that it completely changes
once you've had direct exposure
now if if the only thing you've done is
watch fox news and see these you know
these armies of brown people coming
across the border it does look like an
invasion that looks scary
but if you're in it
like you're seeped in it as i am
not not people who just came across the
border but if you seeped in the culture
it's very embracing
and it's not scary at all
like i
you know if you wonder what your future
looks like if you're not in california
california is often your future
right for good or bad
right what happens here just happens a
little faster so where maybe what would
you say five years california is about
five years maybe depends on the topic
ahead of what's going to happen
everywhere
and
if you live here
i don't know anybody who is
has
extended exposure
to the recent immigrants who doesn't
love them
i don't
now i'm sure they exist
and it has a lot to do with the town i
live in right we're pretty open town
so things are things are pretty good
like mentally where i live there's not a
lot of hate a lot of acceptance here
so
i'm just giving you my view
now if you say that's not how it feels
where i am well that's the point that is
the point it doesn't feel like that
where you are because but but here's
what i don't see i don't see anybody who
is who is really
surrounded by the
the immigrant culture
who doesn't love them
i don't know anybody
in fact privately when people talk they
say yeah they're awesome
that's what people say behind their
backs
so how would you like to be that
how would you like to be the immigrant
community
that when people talk about you behind
your back
it's almost always positive
i mean that's pretty good
talk about managing your brand that's
pretty good
all right
elon musk visited the pope
and the the big news that came out of
that is that um
i expected it would be like matter and
anti-matter and that when they shook
hands
there would be some kind of a black hole
or explosion
and both of them would disappear in a
giant fireball
that didn't happen which shakes my
confidence and everything i knew about
reality
but i also wonder what was the thinking
of either elon musk or the pope
don't you say to yourself huh
i wonder if the pope
converted elon musk from being a
non-believer
elon musk believes in the simulation i
wonder if the pope
tried or had any success
moving elon musk to become more of a
believer
and then i asked myself
well which one of those two is more
persuasive
pope
a plus
you don't become the pope
unless you got some serious catholic
skills am i right like you know there's
a lot of work to become a pope that's
not an easy entry-level job so you have
to say that the pope
probably is a real persuasive
person wouldn't you say
but he's not as persuasive as elon musk
which is interesting
very rare situation
somebody visiting the pope who's
verifiably in my opinion verifiably
more persuasive than the pope i'll bet
that's almost never happened
it has probably almost never happened
when the person who's more persuasive is
not a
believer so what i'm wondering is if
elon musk had any luck
convincing the pope to
abandon his religion
i mean there's no reporting on it
we don't know what they talked about
but i don't know
i'd be a little worried if i were a
catholic and my pope spent 10 minutes
with the most persuasive person on the
planet
who also thought we lived in a
simulation and that my religion wasn't
real
i'd be worried about it
[Laughter]
i'd be worried about that
no i'm just joking
but it is weird that the world's biggest
non-believer at least you know most
famous for being a non-believer
would visit the pope of all things
it's a wonderful world i'm glad that you
did
well in california a lot of californians
are getting what they call inflation
relief checks
inflation relief
and so i was quite excited about this
because i live in california and so i
thought oh i can't wait to get my
inflation relief check
let's check the eligibility eligibility
um i will not be receiving a check i
will not be receiving a check
but i'm not alone the other people who
will not be receiving a check
for inflation relief are the poor
so the middle class will be doing pretty
well but the poor have been completely
excluded
because since they don't pay taxes
they don't have you know direct deposit
and bank accounts
the government can't easily find them
and give them money
so instead and wouldn't know how much to
give because it's based on your income
anyway
so the poor get nothing
and the rich get nothing but the middle
class will do pretty well
i don't know is that a partial win
i i feel like we could have done better
at giving all the money to the poor
am i wrong about that
would we have been a little bit better
giving all the money to the poor instead
of oh
none of it
now i'm all in favor of doing things
that are good for the middle class
but if you have only one pot of money
and you you've got poor people
middle class
and rich people
half of their decision was pretty good
let's not give it to rich people
okay i mean you could argue that the
money came from the rich people so you
just be giving it back but all right
forget about that the rich people can at
least afford it
but then when you're deciding you know
afford not to get it so and then when
you're deciding
should we give this money to the middle
class or the people who need it much
more
they decided to give it to the people
who didn't need it as much
yes you're wrong
somebody says in all caps
okay
yeah i guess the poor people don't vote
so there's no no point giving them
relief checks
well here's a little thing that uh makes
me scratch my head have you seen the
pictures i don't know if these are real
so you know you tell me if this is even
fake news it might be fake news but
there are long lines for tesla charging
in the public charging stations
and apparently it takes you half an hour
to an hour to get a charge
and
uh there's long lines suggesting that
the people at the end of the line
would have to wait
you know six hours
just to charge their car
is that real
because
um
this has got no content
the trolls are active today
imagine being a troll
like that was the best thing you had
today was to yell at me in capital
letters
like well
the best thing i got going today in my
life
as i got on a live stream and made
everybody a little less happy with my
comments
that's what i did say but do you think
that it's true that the
teslas are lined up for hours to get
charged
here's my degree in economics
my degree in economics tells me the
following
you would not build a network of
charging stations
to fulfill 100 of all possibilities that
would be cost prohibitive
you would
build a network of charging stations
that could handle 98
of all situations
today's the two percent
you know the holidays are the two
percent that's when everybody's
traveling at the same time so
it seems to me likely
that the charging network is only
designed for the 98 of the time when
traffic is normal and not designed for
the two percent you know i'm just making
up two percent but not not designed for
that small number of times when
everybody's traveling am i right
so that's probably a real problem
but i can't
i'm not i don't trust the news enough to
know if it's just something that
happened once
i mean we might already be past the line
i don't know or is it getting worse
who knows
you know what would be interesting is if
just private people
started charging people's cars in their
own driveway you know just run an
extension card out to the driveway put
up a sign
charge your tesla 20 bucks or whatever
it costs
and uh
couldn't couldn't private people sell
charging
just park in my driveway plug it in for
an hour
yeah you could right
so maybe something like that will happen
so there's an ongoing debate about tick
tock and whether or not china has access
to information because it's a chinese
company
and brendan carr
he's on the
website the
fcc
and he's asking apple and google to drop
the app
because it's sending data to china
now
tiktok had assured us it's not going to
do that and
but apparently
it's confirmed that some of the data was
available in china
and i think at this point
if we were fooled about what uh data is
going back to china
and tick tock was involved in fooling us
you have to you have to take it out of
the app store
now i don't know if these two things are
true so let me say these are allegations
see the allegation would be that
uh people were concerned that china the
the you know the government would have
access to all this private information
in tick dock
and tick tock said to the world and to
us
no don't worry
because we moved our data into china so
china doesn't have access to it
but it turns out that was incorrect
and it
apparently it's been verified that's the
allegation that that data was available
to china
now under those circumstances
can you let that company remain in
business
i don't think so
what does your business
and managerial leadership instinct tell
you if a company lied to you about
something that basic
does the chinese government have our
private information
no
no
no no no
chinese government
heck no there's no way the chinese
government is going to get any of this
information
it did oh well yeah i got a little of it
and when i say a little of it they got a
lot of it
but you know next time we'll fix it
well can you fix it for sure next time
because you said last time that they
couldn't get it and then they did
but why would we trust you the second
time
why would we lie to you have we ever
lied to you yeah
you literally just lied
allegedly
you literally just allegedly
lied to us you said they didn't get it
and then we proved that they were why
would you act differently the second
time
given that the chinese government
probably really wants that information
why would we trust you that when you say
it's not going there
and the answer is you can't
and they proved that you can't trust
them by lying about that very exact
thing you don't even have to say
they're liars in general
so we worry that they would lie about
this specific thing
you don't even have to do that because
you could say they just lied on this
very specific thing
why in the world would you trust them to
not lie
again
on that very specific thing which is the
most important thing
probably which is you know exposure to
the data in china
so
trump and his administration wanted to
get rid of this and their instinct was
to get rid of it now and fast and just
you know do it
but they were stymied by whatever forces
so here we are
so if you signed up on tick tock good
luck china knows a lot about your
preferences
i'm seeing a comment that my only
contact with the immigrant community is
when they mow my lawn and clean my house
not true
right so i don't think you listen to
anything i just said
if you live here you're steeped in it
it's just everywhere
this is everywhere you go you know it's
everywhere
like it's in the personal life it's in
the schools it's every business you go
to
um when i when i door dash
sometimes the person speaks english
right so if you live here you're
you're you're uh steeped in it it's not
something that you see
in passing you're you're in it you're
swimming in it
all right
um
some of you are wondering what happened
with the
special
live stream i started last night
i already explained this to the people
on locals but if there's anybody on
youtube who saw me tweet about it i
started one that i had to bail nf
because something came up so that's all
you need to know
so it doesn't exist if you're looking
for it it was never completed
and i may or may not complete it today
or later
i would like to read for you
some of the best most important words
ever written
can you do you want to
you want to hang for that for a minute
now i want you to listen to this not
only for the meaning of the words
but for how well it's written
because remember you know one of the
things that we've learned is you want
short clean sentences
but in the old days they didn't write
these short clean sentences they wrote
these amazingly big long complicated
ones it's really hard to write a really
amazingly long complicated sentence
and then have people read it and be
inspired and like understand it like
you've got to really be a good writer to
do that
so i'm going to read you some of the
best writing i've ever seen in my life
which violates a lot of rules of writing
and i want you to see if it
has a historical meaning that is still
relevant today
so see if there's any relevance to this
today
you might recognize this
when in the course of human events it
becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have
connected them with another and to
assume among the powers of the earth the
separate equal station to which the laws
of nature and nature's god entitle them
a decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should
declare the causes
which impel them to the separation
my favorite sentence i love that
we hold these truths to be self-evident
that all men are created equal that they
are endowed by their creator with
certain unalienable rights that among
these are life liberty and their pursuit
of happiness
that to secure these rights governments
are instituted among men derived their
just powers from the consent of the
governed
that whatever any form of government
becomes destructive of these ends it is
the right of the people to alter or to
abolish it
and to institute a new government laying
its foundation on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form
as to them shall seem most likely to
affect their safety and happiness
prudence indeed will dictate that
governments long established should not
be changed for light and transient
causes and accordingly all experience
the hath shoon
that mankind are more disposed to suffer
while evils are sufferable than to write
themselves by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed
but what a long train of abuses and use
super
user patients
pursuing invariably the same object
evinces a design
to reduce them under absolute despotism
it is their right it is their duty
to throw off such government and to
provide new guards for their future
security
such has been the patient sufferance of
these colonies and such is now the
necessity which constrains them to alter
their former systems of government the
history of the present king of great
britain is a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations all having a
direct object the establishment of an
absolute tyranny over these states
to prove this let facts be submitted to
a candid world
and so they did
and so they did
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the best writing
in the history of the world
i would argue
and on that note
let's have a great fourth of july in the
united states
and the rest of you i hope you
take a moment today
to
appreciate
freedom
and
that concludes my program for today have
a great fourth
