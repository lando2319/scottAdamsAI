hey everybody
come on in come on in you're just in
time it's time
for coffee with scott adams yes i'm
accidentally doing a mr rogers taking
off my sweater at the beginning of the
broadcast i wish i'd planned it
but i didn't so
we've got one of the best live streams
maybe of all time really if you were to
look at all the live streams that have
been broadcast in the
last 15 billion years
this one best one yeah
of the entire 15 year 15 billion year
span
best one i know it's amazing and all you
need to make it better is a copper
margarita glass attacker chelsea stand
canteen jungle flash vessel for the kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopey bean of the day
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous setback and
it's going to happen now
all over the world at the same time
thus simultaneity go
well whoever's taking a bong hit i just
see in the comments
good choice good choice
well let's talk about all the news shall
we
ex-cia head john brennan said on msnbc
that he's quote i'm increasingly
embarrassed
to be a white male these days he's
embarrassed to be a white male
well john i'm a white male
and i'm a little bit embarrassed too a
little bit embarrassed
maybe not for exactly the same reasons
as you but
i have to say i feel it i do feel it
of course in my case it's being caused
by john brennan
but i've been told that i can take
credit
and also the blame for what total
strangers do who happen to
share any pigmentation with me so
if there's anybody who's also white
who's committing a crime right now
well that's on me if there's anybody
white
that i've never met and never will who's
inventing something cool
i take the credit for that why obviously
similar pigmentation why wouldn't i take
credit for the work of strangers
if they have similar pigmentation that's
just
logical well ikea is selling a
tiny pre-built home that comes on its
own
sort of trailer situation they'll
pull it right up to your plot of land
and there you've got a little home
now people said to me what's so special
about that scott
we've always had mobile homes ikea
making one
isn't that different is it but you'd
have to see it
it's very window centric instead of a
classic mobile home that's more metal
size and little windows
it's sort of open you know it's windy
and if they got the insulation right
i don't know if they did but if they did
for forty seven thousand
five hundred dollars you could have a
tiny home with
one tiny bathroom in the bedroom and
etc now the big deal i think
is that companies like ikea are getting
into it but i still think the big win
and where this is going think of this
price
think of this price say let's say
rounded to fifty thousand dollars
suppose uh in a few years apple computer
gives you this
option you could have a home that's
worth
let's say a hundred thousand dollars to
build so
something twice as good as this maybe
better than twice as good by then
so it's twice as good it's free
and it's made by apple computer so it's
high quality right
it's just free it costs a hundred
thousand
if they were gonna sell it on the market
probably it would cost you maybe two
hundred thousand to buy it
they give it to you for free but
you have to use apple products as long
as you live there
all of them so if you're gonna if you're
gonna have wi-fi
you get it from apple if you can have a
phone service you get it from apple
if you're gonna have a you know a laptop
get it from apple
and apple makes its money by
by just you know forcing you into their
system
and they don't even care if you pay
nothing for rent
might pay some energy costs maybe dabble
maybe to tesla maybe it's a tesla house
give it to you free and all you have to
do is pay for electricity
or pay for the you know tesla products
let's say
so you wouldn't be paying for the
electricity directly i think that's
where it's going
um and maybe this is the first sign all
right
uh there is yet another
vex on yet another study showing that
one dose
of the coronavirus vaccine and i don't
think it matters which one you get at
this point
that one dose will give you something
like 80 percent effective
protection from hospitalization for
serious
problems percent now if they give you
the second dose that gets
into the mid 90s or higher right so
here's a question i asked what if we
ever had a
two dose regimen before when that
happened i said to myself
well i get that we've always had
vaccinations but why is
this one a two-dose vaccination
whereas uh yeah that
my dog is so loud snickers wake up
wake up
there you go she snores so loudly
so i was curious why this was the one
where
multiple makers of the vaccine thought
it needed two doses
and i was curious about that now the
latest studies show that maybe it
shouldn't have been two doses at all
was there anybody saying that who was
credible early on was there anybody
credible saying hey
uh if you do the math one dose at 80
protection given given that it's limited
right if you had
unlimited doses then of course everybody
should get two
i think we'd all agree on that right if
it's unlimited
give everybody two but it's very limited
and time matters a lot under that
condition
would you take 80 percent protection
really fast
or would you really really slow things
down to get to 95
for the few who actually get the shot
just
just in your sort of general common
sense
statistically ignorant brain which one
sounds better
well let me add a little wrinkle let's
say that if you're a senior citizen
you're in a
specifically let's say you're in a
senior care facility
let's say we give all of them too nobody
would argue with that i don't think
right
because there aren't that many you know
you can give all of the the
nursing home people too and still have
plenty
to give people one well i believe there
were people like nate silver and
and other economists and statisticians
who would be
typically ignored for a medical question
because that's outside their field
but as andres beckhaus was pointing out
to me this morning
privately just that there were people
who were on this
early but they weren't doctors they were
the wrong kind of expert
except that they were the right kind of
expert
because what you needed was somebody who
could do math
that's why you need it you didn't need
somebody who knew what a
what a vaccine was or you didn't need
somebody who was
like the virology expert you needed
somebody who could do math
say what you will about nate silver if
you're politically opposed to his
opinions or whatever
but what you can't take away from him he
can do math
he can do math and he just did the math
and he said
uh if the one dose is anywhere i'm
sort of putting words in his mouth he
didn't say this but the idea is that if
one dose gets you to something like 80
and there was a strong reason to believe
that that would be true
we're doing it all wrong i mean like
really wrong
as wrong as you could get indeed i would
say that the decision
to do two doses rather within one
may have killed millions of people or or
might in the long run
that one statistical error which
the statistic the the qualified
statisticians
pointed it down right away right it
wasn't like we didn't know
the people who can do math raised their
hand and said
um i feel like you're doing the math
wrong
now what does this sound like does this
sound like another situation
it should sound like the rapid test
issue
so the same math that makes sense in the
vaccines
which is a lower effectiveness single
dose
can get you to wider immunity faster
the same argument or similar enough is
that the
lower the lower quality rapid testing
might only be you know 80 or 90
effective as opposed to
closer to 100 but if you did lots of
people quickly and cheaply
you'd still catch so much of it they
might
you know stop the pandemic that way well
the fda
has approved a yet another rapid test
the other rapid tests i think you still
have to send it to a lab
but you can do it at home and then you
have to wait for the mail etc
but the new one apparently you get your
you can do it yourself and you you get
your own result
um and it's 80 effective
uh or no but something like that it's
it's not perfect but it's a high
effectiveness
and you can do it at home
and you don't have to wait for results
you get a result in 10 minutes
so we're done right
didn't i tell you that if you could have
a quick
home test that was at least that good
you would catch so much of the at lea
you would probably get
all of the super spreaders because the
ones that it misses are the ones who are
not shedding that much
right so that the difference between
whether the these cheap tests
catch the virus or not is not about the
quality of the test
the test is the same test every time
it's just if you have a lot of virus
you're a super spreader it'll catch you
every time
but if you're maybe just at the
beginning you just got a little bit of
shedding
well then that might miss it so
as long as you get the super spreaders
and you get them quickly enough
pretty much the pandemic's over right
oh no i forgot to tell you something
no the pandemic isn't solved do you know
why
our fda decided that you need
a prescription
to stick this thing up your nose
what are you
kidding me yeah look at the comments
you're dumbfounded now aren't you can
you think of
any reason that the fda would require
a prescription to get this thing that
you can do at home and
you know a 13 year old can do it you're
just sticking something up your nose and
putting it in a vial basically
can you think of any legitimate reason
no you can't you can't think of any
legitimate reason
now suppose that's just a failure of our
imagination
suppose there are actually a good reason
for it
do you give the fda a because there's a
good reason
 no because they didn't tell us the
reason
if you don't tell us the good reason
we must assume you are corrupt we must
assume that
and so i would ask you to assume that
that your fda
has now signaled unambiguously i mean
before i was a little suspicious
no i was very suspicious that something
was going on that wasn't quite right
because we should have had these tests
approved a long time ago
but now it's confirmed the the adding
the requirement for the prescription
either doesn't have a reason which would
mean there's a corrupt reason
or and this is the part you can confirm
they're not providing a reason
it's the same thing either they don't
have one or they have one and they're
not telling you
in either case this is a complete
failure of the fda for whatever reason
might be a mystery now let me ask you
this
if trump heard this
how would he act somebody said hey
mr trump looks like we've got a solution
oh looks like we don't
because they added this requirement for
a prescription
now when a doctor prescribes it what
what do you think the doctor is looking
out for
to make sure that somebody is like knows
how to do it right
now it could be that the only reason is
to limit limit the number of them which
would be the shadiest reason in the
world in my opinion
but suppose somebody comes to trump and
they say oh well we got the technology
now
we got the technology so we can solve
this problem with this rapid testing
when i say solve that's hyperbole right
we can we can make a big difference
and what does the president say goes
great everybody will get this right now
turns out the fda put a requirement on
it for a prescription
so it basically won't make any
difference to the pandemic it really
won't it won't make any difference
if you require a prescription just won't
be enough of them
what would trump say
what do you think what would trump do in
that situation
well we don't know like we'd have to
speculate my guess would be
that they just told them the difference
between
a successful presidency and an
unsuccessful one
and that he would have ripped the fda
out by the roots
to get that changed i think
i think you would have ripped them out
by the roots to get that changed
now i speculate and and only weekly in
this on this following point
that trump wasn't aware in other words
his advisors had never brought him this
proposition about the cheap less
accurate tests
being a good solution if you do it right
i feel like maybe nobody ever brought
that to him
because i think he would have made it
happen again just speculating no way to
know that right
but what will biden do will biden say
trust the science i feel like he might
is this science nope
is he going to say trust the experts
because you know there must be some
reason that they're
putting this requirement on there i feel
that he's committed himself to trusting
the experts
and the experts appear to be screwing
the whole country
maybe killing millions there is no
it's not there's no even similarity
between how many people uh died in the
governor cuomo case of putting
infected people back in nursing homes
and that's you know in the thousands
horrible horrible situations thousands
of people died
from that mistake how many people will
die from this mistake
a lot more like way more it's not even
close
if you're comparing government ups
biden's up right now which by the
way
let me be as clear as i can if this had
been president trump and he
also didn't fix this or at least
obviously trying to fix it
it would be the same up right
nobody gets a pass for their party
affiliation
you're the whole country
by whatever this is right i
i was savage about trump not pursuing
this same option
you know with the cheap tests and now i
got to say the same thing about biden
i mean i was just as savage with trump
most of you heard me
and i'm not going to i'm not going to
pull it back because it's biden
biden you're in you're in the barrel
it's your job
if you don't fix this or and i would be
satisfied intellectually with this it
wouldn't be as good but
at least i'd be satisfied intellectually
give us a good reason
just tell us a reason that the fda
requires this to be a prescription thing
if there's a reason i'm open to it right
i'm not an unreasonable person
i just need to hear the reason if not
biden you need to go you need to
be fired
with cuomo because these are these are
the size of mistakes that are completely
unreasonable
and by the way if if trump lost his
reelection
because he didn't handle the coronavirus
well enough i'm fine with that
i'm absolutely fine with that if trump
if trump really did lose because of
coronavirus because i don't think
i don't think he nailed it i think what
he did with the
the vaccinations was amazing i mean that
was
kennedy-esque leadership nobody can take
that away from them
but but the the testing part the rapid
testing part
specifically i think uh i think trump
failed on that
and biden is failing now um
so listen to uh listen to statisticians
too
not just medical people um
apparently uh biden has declared that
this
is uh irish american heritage month
march marches
now i guess this is a fairly normal
thing every
every year the government just re-ups
and
says hey it's irish american heritage
month
to which i say we only have 12
months now we've got black history month
that seems like a good idea i'm all for
that
now we've got irish american heritage
month so that's march
we've only got 10 left is that enough
because i feel like there's going to be
a lot of underserved
ethnicities here and that doesn't seem
right
by the time we get to estonian americans
what month are they going to have
nothing
they'll all be used up and i think
that's a little bit racist
isn't it now if the guy who is declaring
its irish american heritage month
happens to be an irish american
say biden how do you feel about that
if it feels like he's the one who
shouldn't do that
like it it doesn't feel like you should
declare
a month for your own people if you're
the leader
if trump had declared scottish american
history uh heritage month what would
what would the news have done to him
is there is there such a thing as
scottish american history
so that would have been trump if he had
tried to get away from that get away
with that that would just be white
supremacy
but maybe biden can get away with this
because it's a long
long tradition but are we using the same
standards for the left as the right
let's keep an eye on that
let's talk about dr seuss you all want
to talk about that so i've been
following this story
lightly like there's some stories you
dig in
and there are other stories you just
read the headline and move on
and this dr seuss one i've been reading
the headlines and moving on
because i trusted that the following
would happen
i trusted that just being a consumer of
news
and you know dipping in all the time and
turning on the news all the time
that i would clearly and unambiguously
be presented with the examples
of those things which maybe didn't look
so bad when they were first done
but society has has evolved and maybe
they look bad now
so i wanted to see some of the examples
of the horrible horrible things
in these dr seuss books
have any of you seen any has anybody
actually seen
an example of one of the offensive
things
now i've heard them described but i
haven't seen them
now are we so are we so
sensitive
snickers wake up
i i just i have to be more exciting i
i'm boring my dog to sleep
it's causing a problem
all right so none of you i believe none
of you have seen any
examples right
somebody says i don't think scott's
irish is a real thing i don't know what
that means
so the the description of these offenses
is that it's a quote racist imagery
of asian and black characters now i
think that's a real thing
like um in my opinion and i have to deal
with this all the time because i'm a
professional cartoonist
so when you're a professional cartoonist
uh
the the market will ask you to have
diversity in your product
that's reasonable right have a make your
make your comic look like the real world
that's what i want to do i draw a comic
about the real world
so of course i want it to look as much
like the real world as possible
including a diverse cast but there's a
problem
do you know what the problem is it's a
big one
here's the problem if i as generic
white guy introduce let's say an
african-american character
into my comic what would be the
personality i would give that character
because remember to make it a good comic
all of the characters have gigantic
flaws
so alice gets angry too quickly the boss
is
uh you know clueless dilbert is sort of
a nerd you know he doesn't have his
social
graces wally's lazy shook the intern
who's the only person who has any
interesting flavor at all because he was
born in india
but it shook the intern in the dilbert
comic the only flaw i could give him
that i could stay out of trouble was
that he's inexperienced
that's it his only flaw is one
of youth which of course is solved you
know it's self-solving
so i couldn't even give a shook the one
character in my strip i couldn't even
give him a real flaw
i had to give him the only kind of flaw
you can give somebody that isn't real
you know you just grow out of it like
everybody does it's like being a kid
now what happened when i introduced a
indian american character
i was blamed accused of being a racist
because the ashook character sometimes
did silly things
and people said um you should be
canceled for saying such bad things
about black people
now my defense was um he's a shook
the intern from india
he's not a he's not a black character to
which my public said
stop making this racist comic about
black characters
to which i said oh maybe you didn't hear
me the first time
there actually aren't there are no black
characters in the strip
and the reason i do that is out of
respect
because i don't know a way that i could
add a
well and out of fear as well but it is
also out of respect
that i don't know that i could treat the
character right and i do think i have
some obligation to do that
and my public says but why are you being
so racist about your black characters to
which i say
i don't think you hear me i don't have
any
and there's a reason there's a reason
it's because you can't you just can't do
it
in in our current situation there's no
way i could do it without getting
canceled
because i would have to add a flaw and
then that's the end of it i'm canceled
right so dr seuss of course had a
different situation because he
had the dr seuss books because they were
old enough that he just did whatever
seemed appropriate at the time but now
looks wildly inappropriate by her
modern eyes and i would guess that he
has some
pictures of asian and black characters
that
probably are so probably so racist by
modern standards that you would laugh
when you saw them
because you know you would laugh
comparing them to what is acceptable now
to what was acceptable then
but i'd like to see them because i think
we should laugh them away
am i wrong let me ask you um
if you are let's say if you're black or
asian american you're watching this live
stream let me ask you this question
don't you think we'd be better off
publishing the pictures
and all having a good laugh isn't that
healthier
because i don't think there are any
white people who are saying yeah let's
the world is better if we make the the
non-white characters like
weird weirdly stereotypical
there's zero people on the other side of
the argument
nobody there's nobody on the other side
of the argument nobody says
well i would really like the non-white
characters to be
you know insultingly drawn nobody
nobody's on that side it's not like
statues where people have some unrelated
argument about
free speech and history and stuff like
that there's nobody on the other side
if we can't laugh at this together
like what the hell we're not even trying
let me tell you how to solve this
here's how you would solve the dr seuss
thing somebody owns the rights
i don't know if it's family members or
publishers who owns the rights by this
point
i think that they should
hire a black cartoonist
to suggest a non-offensive
let's say drawing style to replace the
originals
and but to keep it within the style of
the original dr seuss
but also make sure that everybody knows
what the original is
so so that you know in the book it says
this was modified for this reason
you should be able to see the original
you don't want the original to
to be forever gone you know it needs to
be put in his proper
context but i've been thinking about
doing this for
dilbert because on one hand you know i
know
my audience especially is thinking some
version of
uh scott don't be so don't be so weak
just make your characters do what you do
let the chips fall i don't live in that
world
i don't live in that world i live in a
world in which i
prefer people to be polite
you know forget about the wokeness and
all that stuff
can't we be polite can't we just be
polite to each other
do we even have to worry about any of
any of the other stuff if you're just
polite
how polite is it to
publish offensive characters of some
group now i get that it maybe wasn't as
offensive in the past and
so maybe you were too woke now but here
we are
right here we are however we got here
doesn't matter here we are
it's just not polite
to do offensive things that people find
defensive if you can avoid it
and how hard would it be to get a get a
black cartoonist and say look give us a
hand
redraw these characters we'll just
change the ones that are offensive
and then we'll annotate it so everybody
knows what we did same with the asian
american characters that's why i'd
handle it
and by the way i've been thinking for a
long time and i think i'm
i feel as though i'm going to pull the
trigger on this although this could
backfire
i'm thinking of doing the same thing
with dilbert
i'm thinking of asking black lives
matter for example
literally to say hey i've got this issue
i'd like to add some diversity
i can't do it alone nothing wrong with
that
there's nothing wrong with saying you
can't do it alone right i can't do it
alone
give me a hand help me develop a
character
with a flaw gotta have a flaw or i don't
want it
and not not one of these weak flaws like
they're inexperienced
i need a real give me a genuine flaw
but you need to develop it for me and
then i'll then i'll operate with it
now now is that
is that too woke have i gone too far to
the other side
to say hey give me a hand on this i
don't think so
because i'm saying that there's
something that i can't do i'm just in a
situation where
like it wouldn't work if i do it that's
just a practical statement
if i get a hand maybe i can do it and
then i have more
diversity in the strip i don't know how
somebody says pandering
so that's what i was getting for i don't
think it is
i don't think that um i don't think that
evolving your product
to be more compatible with the customers
is pandering i think that's commerce
right pandering feels different
pandering feels like you're doing it
just for maybe looks
or you're doing it just to make somebody
happy that would not be my motivation
my motivation would be to have a product
which more people like that's it
and be polite just be polite and have a
product people like
all right i'm repeating myself too much
and thank you for pointing that out
there's a company called myheritage all
one word myheritage
which you can take an old photo and they
will
they will animate it like a harry potter
photo that moves
so you can just take an old photo of
your grandparents
and turn it into a photo where the the
head instead of just looking at you like
a still photo
is looking around a little bit
look around the room now how hard would
it be to take it to the next step
where the photos all follow you when
you're walking around
that's going to happen so
this is fun in the world of deep fakes
even our photographs will come to come
to life
and already have so this is current
technology
there's nothing about this that is
speculative
this is right now and they look really
really real
a lot of people saying what's going to
happen when the deep fakes are so good
that you can make a famous actor
with the the software does the original
actor
own their face what do you think
does tom cruise own his face
if somebody wanted to make a deep fake
and then make a movie about it
is that is there or is there a lawyer
here
because i don't know the answer to that
question and what
what would it take for it not to be
owned by
tom cruise suppose you took tom cruise
and you made him um
black but otherwise it looks just like
him
does tom cruise still own it or did you
modify it enough
somebody says he should why
now he should if you were trying to sell
a movie with
uh as if it were the real tom cruise
now if somebody's trying to sell a deep
fake as the real person
that's definitely illegal no question
about that but
suppose somebody makes a movie and they
say we're going to make
a software version of tom cruise but
we're not going to try to fool you
we're just doing it in software it's not
really tom cruise he has nothing to do
with this
is that illegal i don't know
but i'll bet it's legal only because the
law didn't
anticipate it yeah it would not be it
would not be a counterfeit
if you labeled it correctly it's only
the false labeling that gets you in
trouble
am i right so here's my prediction
that you will not see big movie studios
trying to make movies with fake versions
of real people
there will be some of it but it will be
a transitional period
in other words there will be a period in
history in which
maybe there's some you put maybe you put
a younger paul newman into a movie
or a younger any actor into a movie and
maybe the real actor is still associated
and
agrees that their younger self will be
there maybe they even do the voice
maybe somebody does the voice of their
own younger character
so you see a period where that happens
but long term the economics guarantee
that it will not be real actors that the
fake the fakes are
in the long term simple economics and by
the way if i ever taught you that if you
add economics to your talent stack
you can see around corners a simple
understanding of economics just lets you
see the future
because money talks money is predictable
people are predictable when it comes to
money
so whenever money is involved you
immediately become very predictable
because people act the same way around
it and here's the predictable part
why would you pay tom cruise tom cruise
is expensive
if you're if you're going to work with
him and you probably would
to use his cgi deep fake
that's really expensive do you know
what's better than that
making a version that's not tom cruise
that's better than him
because tom cruise as engaging as he is
he's not the best looking guy in the
world
wouldn't you like a taller tom cruise
ah see where i'm going tom cruise is
five six wouldn't you want a taller one
come on of course you would so why would
you
why would you make one that looks just
like the star
when it would be trivially easy to make
a better one
do you think that um that tom cruise is
let's say uh what do you call it uh
symmetrical
probably not i think the thing is his
nose is a little weird right
so all you do is start with what's good
and then the ai will
very rapidly figure out what people want
to look at it will create
characters based on what people like the
most you could even do it in real time
just show your character which one which
of these two do you like better
people would vote and as people are
voting the ai is changing the
the choices so that it just
builds in real time the perfect
character that everybody wants to see
that's the one you want to get you don't
want the crappy old looks like tom
cruise
with all of his you know pimples and
warts and his fife was six and he's
getting older
why would he want that why would he pay
twice as much
for the thing that's clearly worse so in
the long run
regular actors will be replaced there's
no
there's no possibility it could go
another way in the long run
no possibility it could go any other way
because of economics
um all right um
have you seen that twitter does this
thing where they
they'll note that the comments may have
some offensive ones
and you can't read the rest of the
comments until you click on a thing that
says they may be offensive
and then you click on it and there's
nothing offensive there
even slightly is this another shadow
banning technique
i'm trying to understand what it is
because it feels like just
another way to hide stuff from certain
people but not others
now i don't have like direct evidence
that that's the purpose of it
but what i also don't have is any clue
what would be a different reason for it
can you think of any reason that most of
my comments
would be hidden that way when none of
them are offensive
or even a little bit
what is the second possible reason for
that i can't think of one
now again if i've taught you this a
million times
you have to be careful that the real
problem here is the limit of your own
imagination
so i'm saying uh think of all the
other reasons that some comments would
be routinely
hidden that way i can't think of one
maybe technical limitations
maybe there's a ai that's not so smart
that they can't tell the difference is
it that people reported some comments
and they report maybe conservative stuff
more than others
maybe yeah i suppose if you really
stretch your imagination you could
kind of sort of imagine some other
reason that might be happening
but it's a stretch isn't it it's a
stretch we live in a world in which
if it looks like it's obvious some some
bad behavior
is happening this probably is it
probably is
somebody says youtube is frozen
it looks like it's working to me um
anyway biden is considering putting
sanctions on
putin i guess over the jailing of
navalny the putin critic
and the crackdown on the protests
and there's some intelligence review
blah blah blah
what do you think biden's going to do
with russia
because they've been criticizing trump
forever
but what else is there to do like how
many
how many tools does baiden even have
what the hell is he going to do i feel
as if he's trapped
here as he is trapped in many cases in
which he'll end up just doing something
that looks like what trump did
if you look if you know the khashoggi
story the you know the
the saudi arabia situation where
uh be mbs allegedly ordered the uh
the death of khashoggi when it came out
biden did exactly what trump would have
done which is
let the leader slide just let it slide
so there's not really any serious
difference yet between
biden and trump on the international
stuff and the things where there's a
clear difference
seems to be trivial such as rejoining
the
paris climate accord it doesn't really
matter
so all the important stuff is the same
as trump and the unimportant stuff well
doesn't matter um
and i guess biden is also looking at the
reports that russia
allegedly placed bounties on u.s
soldiers in afghanistan
now remember that trump was criticized
for not
acting on that but the other part of the
story is
there was no evidence of it so trump was
criticized for
not acting on what democrats said was
real
but the intelligence agency said we
can't find it
and now biden being on the side that
said it was real
it's his job to do something about the
thing that his own people say isn't real
but when he was out of office he said it
was real where his people did i don't
know how much he said about it
so how do you handle that how do you
handle it
i don't know i think biden's kind of in
a corner
so there's a top-rated arizona news
anchor who resigned
because she didn't want to she didn't
want to report
fake news anymore this is somebody who
worked on a
local fox affiliate carrie lake
she resigned basically because she
didn't want to report
fake news anymore think you'll see more
of that
i don't know so let's talk about
governor cuomo he's got his
third accuser now if there's one thing
that you can guarantee
if there's a famous politician who has
two accusers
of sexual harassment you can bet there
will be a third
you always get the third it must be some
law of the universe that if there are
two there are always three
because when two people come forward
then it becomes a lot easier for the
third one to come
and if there are two they're almost
early or more
so apparently what he said
at a public gathering so this had
nothing to do with any of his employees
but this is the latest thing
he he was holding some woman by the head
and he alleged ask can i kiss you
and i don't even think it was somebody
knew that well just sort of somebody who
was interacting with at a bar
and she was offended and she's talking
about this now the first thing i'd like
to add
is that governor cuomo really doesn't
have much
game
he's really lacking something in the
flirtation department
there's like a gene missing or something
because
if there's one thing that uh let me let
me ask you this
to the women watching this all right so
this question is just for the women
if you're a man don't answer because i
want to know that the answer is only
from women all right
for only women here's the question what
do you think of a man who
asks you if he can kiss you
versus versus just taking a shot and
being turned down or not what is your
feeling of somebody who
asks if they can kiss you go ahead just
the women
just the women
and i i won't know exactly if it's just
the women answering so i'll go tell you
somebody says yuck go for it uh
lame weak insecure creepy
drunk or drunk of power no depends if
you're married
low t weak loser i think this is the men
saying that
coward uh depends on the man
asking is lame wet blanket somebody says
i like it
um a woman i assume uh
loser but in this day safer wimp gross
beta
yes polite i see no way buddy
uh male feminist just looking at your
comments beta
no no good yeah
well so there is not a an agreement on
this
here's here's my best to take on this
i do believe we still live in a world
where women would prefer you to make the
move
i think we live in a world where they
prefer that you make the move
but here's the wrinkle don't be an idiot
about it
nobody likes it if there are no if there
are no signs that it would be warranted
like if you're trying to kiss somebody
and there are no signs
that this would be acceptable well
that's a pretty big problem and it looks
like maybe
governor cuomo has that problem we can't
tell from one anecdote
but if the anecdote is representative
and we don't know that
it looks like he doesn't have that
sensibility
maybe he can't read people or doesn't
care or something
i don't know but you have to separate
the question of whether
somebody makes a move without asking
from the question of do they have enough
sensibility
to know when that makes sense and when
it doesn't
i don't believe in my whole life i've
ever
oh i'm sure i'm wrong like i'm sure as
soon as i say this
somebody from my past will come and say
well that's not true
i can't think of any time i've ever
tried to kiss anybody
where i didn't have a good idea i could
get away with it
i mean i'm searching my data memory for
you know decades i can't think of a time
and
have you have you ever tried to kiss
somebody who had not
shown you that they were interested
i mean it happens a lot apparently so
and because it's slow news time cuomo is
getting extra
lamb basted here now there's also
uh some photos of him having uh
i guess dinner and some drinks with a
female aide
and there's some indication from the
photo but it's a little hard to tell
that his hand under the table might bend
on her leg
now you can't tell from the photo but
the photo does at least suggest
that his hand is extended a little bit
might be on a leg could be on just on
the uh
it could be just on the uh the bench
next to them you can't tell
but of course since we're primed
to think it's bad it looks bad now i'll
tell you he's making the pence rule look
good
the the mike pence ruled that he would
not have a meal
you won't go to lunch with just a woman
unless somebody else is there or else he
brings his wife now the pence rule
sounded ridiculous
the first time you ever heard it didn't
it the first time you heard that it's
like are you serious
mike pence in a business setting you
would not go to lunch
a business lunch with a female
you know who had every right to be there
and you had business
you wouldn't do that didn't that seem
like the dumbest thing
yeah not so much now
this is why and we're also seeing
republican representative
madison cawthorne a young very young guy
who's being blamed for things he did in
college that made women
uncomfortable and so i asked this uh
online i said
what percent of uh men
do you think uh have engaged in
something that was
sexually inappropriate by modern
standards
sexually inappropriate either sexual
harassment
words touching any of that stuff what
percentage of
adult men do you think have participated
in that
now if you look at my survey it's
interesting because the answers are
really spread right there
there are just as many people who think
only 20 percent of men
ish have ever done that
as there are people who think that 90 of
them have done that
think about that just as many people
think 20 of men
are sexual harassers as there are who
think 90
that's a big difference and then the
middle is sort of just
smeared in other words
there is a gigantic difference between
what people would call and i'm going to
put this in big air quotes
normal now in this case normal is
illegal
literally illegal if you think it's
normal
to be sexually harassing somebody in in
the office literally illegal at least
inappropriate at the very least
but what percentage of men do you think
you'd have done that over their lifetime
i feel it's close to 100 it's definitely
90
it's definitely not 20
and i don't and if you know any women
who are
attractive and i hope you do ask them
how many times they have been sexually
harassed
in their lifetime or i could even make
it simpler
ask them how many times they've been
sexually harassed
this week just this week
do you know how many times an attractive
woman gets sexually harassed in just
one week it's insane
it's just off the chart it is so
mind-boggling that you can't even
believe it now i happen to be
married to an unusually attractive woman
so i get to hear the firsthand stories
of
things that happen today but also have
happened whole life and you can't even
believe it
it is so beyond anything that a man
could even
really just understand i mean it is so
bad and of course one assumes
that the higher you get in the
desirability index the worse
it is right because people being people
but then i asked the separate
question how many men have been sexually
harassed at work
given today's modern standards of what
it means to be
sexually harassed what do you how do you
think that came out
a lot a lot of men over 50 percent
have been sexually harassed at work by
modern standards
over 50 percent and the ones that have
not
they're not too good-looking men
i can say this about men i wouldn't say
the same thing about women
because women i think are closer to
universally sexually harassed as close
to all of them
with men it's probably close to half and
it's the half
that are more attractive two women and
two gay men i suppose
because it's a little both now i would
say that i've been
sexually harassed a bunch of times
i mean i don't even know how to put a
number on it by modern standards
i've been sexually addressed in the
workplace
you know 25 times 100 times i don't know
how many times by modern standards
so i guess i'm like at the bottom of the
50
who at least when i was young was worthy
of harassing
by somebody now i don't think that's
even unusual
right because if you're if you're
counting any off-color
joke that was initiated by somebody else
have you ever been the subject of an
off-color
sexual comment by a woman in the office
that you did not start
of course you have of course you have so
if you take it all the way to
inappropriate comments by modern
standards
yeah we we've all been in that so
this is no uh this is not meant as any
kind of a
softener or anything for what governor
cuomo is doing
but it's good context that he's somewhat
universally in a category of bad
behavior
um but that won't matter because it's
political
um let me teach you something about
willpower i told you that
i would teach you at least one thing
every day or reinforce something
that's worth reinforcing but i do it
through the lens of current events
and this is that time here's a topic
which i've
spoken on before but when you have a
perfect example for it
it helps here's how here's a filter to
see the world
when i talk about filters i think i'm
going to sneeze in a moment so
excuse me when i talk about filters i
don't mean what is true
or not true so nothing about this is
truth
or reality it's about choosing a filter
for looking at your life and your
situation
that's a a useful filter doesn't mean
it's right
doesn't mean it's better than other
filters just means it's useful
here's one that's useful get rid of the
idea that free will exists
you can still keep it you can still keep
as one filter
the free will is a real thing in fact
our legal system
requires it in order to punish something
somebody for a crime which is necessary
to reduce the number of crimes
you have to treat them as though they
have free will and that they chose to do
the crime
you can't change that nobody's come up
with a better system
if they do they'd be great but we don't
have a better system
you have to pretend for the legal system
to work
you have to pretend and that's what a
filter is is pretending
that free will is a real thing and
exists but
when you're trying to decide how to feel
about something you don't have to use
that
if you're in the legal system you have
to outside it you don't have to so you
could have a different filter outside
the legal system
and this is the one that i use the most
people have
urges some people have more urges
some people are hornier than other
people
some people are more selfish
some people are more afraid some people
some people just have different levels
of urges
if these urges are low it's easy for you
to stay below the line of bad behavior
in any field
because you don't want to no effort at
all well i don't really even
want to do that i don't have much urge
but as your urge increases
and let's say you're getting into a
flirty
situation or somebody that's starting to
activate your
mating reflex there is a point for men
and by the way can the men watching this
confirm this
for the benefit of the women because i
don't know what it's like to be a woman
i can only speak to a male experience
but i feel i can generalize
for the male experience when you get
horny enough
your brain turns off and i'm pretty sure
we're designed that way
i feel like that's a feature and not a
flaw
because if you were if you had complete
common sense
you would never mate you wouldn't
because if you just you know did a cost
benefit analysis of having children and
stuff
you some people would still do it but a
lot of people wouldn't
so you have to believe that we evolved
in a way
that for men it's probably evolution
put this in there for a reason you know
you're not going to have
quite as many babies if you think about
it
so we're going to turn off your brain in
any of those situations where mating is
a possibility or even think it is
so brain turns off at about this point
and then
bad behavior happens now whoa
let me talk to the dumb people for a
minute smart people
take a little break this next part is
only for any dumb people who came in
because because this is an open live
stream the regulars are all smart you
don't need this at all
so what i'm going to say is completely
useless for the smart people
but for the dumb people who came in this
is going to be really important
i'm not actually defending bad behavior
again this is just for the dumb people i
know it seems like i am
because i said wait your brain turned
off and you don't have free will
therefore the bad behavior is going to
happen so the the dumb people now you're
thinking
i think you just said that governor
cuomo can rape anybody he wants
no no i didn't say that said the
opposite
that in terms of the legal system you
have to act like all this is real
but you're acting it's just an act you
have to do it though
so this graph you could argue it's
either time or opportunity because
there's someone adjusted
and then to the earlier comment um
where this line is the bad behavior line
let's say we're just talking about
sexual harassment where this line is is
a little bit
subjective meaning that i hate to say it
but if somebody is funnier they can get
away with more
if you're if you don't have any sense of
humor and you try to tell a
sexually suggestive joke well
welcome to human resources because that
wasn't funny
it was just offensive but if you pull it
off
let's say i tell something some joke
that's sexually offensive
people i hope would say oh wait a minute
that guy is a professional humorist
his intention is just to be funny he's
not trying to insult anybody
humor is the point i'm laughing i get it
okay i'll let that go
so this line does change if you're
funnier
does governor cuomo have the kind of
sense of humor
where he could lower this or no i guess
raise the bar
so that people say i get it that's just
a joke
apparently not apparently he
doesn't have that kind of sense of humor
but maybe he thinks he does
and that looks like the problem because
he said directly
i thought i was being funny but i'll bet
there will be no example that you'll
ever hear
of something he said where you would say
to yourself yeah okay that was kind of
funny
i'll bet nothing like that i'll bet
everything that he thought was
funny if you heard it you would say
not so much and the second thing is your
hotness
we're not supposed to talk about this
but whether you're male or female
your hotness level is going to adjust
this whole graph right
because if you're not attractive
people are not going to have the same
urge it will be easier for them to
avoid it so that's your model
it is not the only model to understand
life like i said the
the criminal justice has to be different
but i find it always useful when you're
you're trying to decide how to feel
about any of this to have this context
all right um
if we're being objective at all
about uh governor cuomo
i feel like you have to be a little bit
glass half full
sometimes because you could be
overwhelmed with the negativity
and i would just like to say just put it
out there
objectively speaking there's still a lot
more people
that governor cuomo has not killed
and not yet sexually harassed if he were
to compare the numbers
the number of people he killed in
nursing homes plus the number of people
he sexually harassed
very small compared to all the people he
hasn't killed and all the people he
hasn't sexually harassed
just keep it in context that was a joke
for the dumb people
for the dumb people that was a joke
all right um seems to me that forcing
the
people on the vocal left to live by
their own rules
is working quite well it's working with
the the cuomo thing
here's some other examples i thought
were funny i just saw this on the
internet
that a lot of so-called racist images
are being removed from
old food products so aunt jemima's going
away
uncle ben landa lakes they all decided
that their imagery was a little
too racist but what's what's the outcome
of that
what is the predictable outcome of that
well it turns out the predictable
outcome is that all the remaining faces
are white
so you go into your grocery store and
there are no people of color on your
packaging
because they were all removed is that
what they wanted
right now they got what they wanted so
what happens if you just keep giving the
left
what they want do they get what they
want
if you give them what they ask for
that's where we're at
so the left pretty much had to cancel al
franken because that was sort of their
thing
right they kind of had to and i think
they'll have to cancel andrew cuomo
there's really no choice for that i mean
i don't think he could survive this i
don't think so but maybe
and then even letting portland go ahead
with their
autonomous zones and whatever all of
that
all of that has the benefit of letting
people get what they want to find out
they didn't want it it's like letting
the dog catch the car
i mean biden is the dog that caught the
car oh i'm going to go
do something really different with the
khashoggi okay maybe i'll do the same
thing
i'm going to do something really
different with north korea
except what can you do i guess i'll do
the same thing trump did
biden caught the car good luck with it
um same with putin sanctions is there
anything left
i mean really what can biden do
right how about kids in cages
what did biden do with the kids in cages
well he did the only thing he could do
he changed the words
we're going to call them containers and
we're going to have you know
there but they're way better tents our
tents and containers are
way better than these chain link faint
fence
things um all right
uh and then the transgender
sports thing is maybe the most perfect
example of this
because the reason that women's sports
exists
is because women complained they were
they were being treated as
second-class citizens and said why are
all these sports facilities in schools
and why can't women
be part of that except as cheerleaders
and so yeah
perfectly reasonable that things evened
out a bit there
but now the transgenders come along and
once you've opened the door
and i think we all agree women sports is
a good thing there's nobody on the other
side of that is there
but once you've opened the door you kind
of got to expect the door stays open
now the transgenders are a threat to
women's sports
and the way they're not to men's sports
and
again we'll see where that goes i know
you don't like me talking about that
topic
there's some uh interesting drama over
at abc news
with george stephanopoulos and up and
coming david muir
and i guess stephanopoulos was kind of
the the big
chief anchor there but david muir is the
new up up and coming person
and here's the interesting part about
that i've watched a lot of george
stephanopoulos
and it seems to me he's basically just a
democrat
politician who somehow got a news job
like he seems like the least objective
person on tv
who's not on the view i suppose and so
why why does a news organization even
have
someone who isn't even he doesn't even
pretend to be objective
does he i mean he's a weird choice for
news
he's like the opposite of news he's he's
an opinion guy
just you know pretending to be a news
guy
but what about david muir um
in the small world i spent an afternoon
with david muir
a number of years ago in which he was uh
he was doing
reports and stories and one of those
reports was about me
so i spent a whole lot of time with him
you know sort of hung around all
afternoon as he
asked questions and put his report
together
great guy you know i just enjoyed him as
a human being he was just a great guy
and i can't remember seeing him saying
anything on tv that was necessarily
super biased can you
and i and i feel as though this is a
good change maybe maybe a signal or
something
um jordan
peterson and uh apparently has had
warned at one point
and maybe i think brett weinstein might
have said this too that eventually the
left would come for the evolutionary
biologists
in other words people were literally
just scientists
and trying to tell you that evolution
got us to where we are
in other words we have some things baked
into us
that evolution handed us it wasn't our
choice
um and apparently on a clubhouse
event that somebody was challenging
brett weinstein he who i believe he is
an evolutionary biologist
and was saying that that's just another
name for a eugenicist
so now evolutionary biologists
people who belong to the science that i
thought the left liked
right doesn't the left like their
science and their experts
but now they're calling this group of
scientists
eugenesis saying same thing
same thing because if you believe that
that
people's biology has anything to do with
their
their actions then you're probably a
eugenicist according to the left
bure is as most journalists left
yeah i think david muir you could
properly say he's more associated with
left-leaning things
but stephanopoulos he was just a
politician
in disguise it's very different
all right um and i think that's all i
wanted to talk about
let me make sure
so that's all we got um
isn't being left part of their job
description yeah
all right just go look at some of your
comments for a moment
uh did they really remove washington's
statue from
george washington university you know
the statues feels like uh
like old old news i wonder if we'll have
any statue events
under the biden administration because
it feels like
there were some events where they only
existed because trump was president
as if the event itself was ginned up
to give a reason to hate trump even
though the event may have not been a
trump-related event
and so the the the the uh
confederate statue thing feels like
something that was a national topic
because trump was president and that it
gave you something to
you know another weapon to use against
them and that was
maybe the only reason for it otherwise
people don't really give a
i mean once i once i learned that
something north of
20 percent of african-american
uh people polled want to keep the
statues
now what do you say to that over 20
percent of black people want to keep the
statues
why can't they have their statues why is
their opinion not count
i know the majority gets the gets the
rule but i mean i should tell you that
there's something going on that's not
strictly racial about these these
statues i'm anti-statue by the way i'm
the same
on the same um basis that i'm anti a lot
of other things
it's impolite that's it it's just in
play
and i don't want to be involved with
impolite things it doesn't help anybody
all right um somebody said we should
have more statues
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
all right you youtubers who are still
here
um what do i think of biden ending the
deportation of sex offenders
you talk about non-documented
non-citizen people well i don't know how
he
how does he justify it i would love to
know what the argument is
it i'll say this i've said this about
trump and i'll say this about biden
if you don't show us the argument we
have to assume it's
corrupt intent you just have to assume
it
because our politicians do need to show
their work
it's not optional if somebody wants to
make a change like
not deporting sex offenders
explain that to us just go in front of
us and say look
i realize you think this is a good idea
but here's my reasoning there's a bigger
purpose
