oh yes this is going to get
good Snickers and I call this a little
event called the running of the balls
now this is different than
Fetch with fetch the dog would retrieve
this ball but with the running of the
balls she will merely hold one ball in
her mouth while accompan
the other
ball
oh the running of the
balls now she doesn't actually bring
this one back but we need to get a
better
ball there we
go I know this is the
most incredible video you've ever seen
could not be
better the running of the
balls yes this will make you
dis I do not recommend viewing this
video under any
circumstance if you're wondering how
long she can do this I don't know the
answer to that question because I've
never reached her
limit this is a
dog that likes to run with the balls put
it down
okay this is the beginning of a good
time that's a dog who knows that in the
next moment or two
she's going to be having a good time
chasing this ball ready ready
Snickers nice catch didn't even hit the
ground
impressive here we go here we
go well that that was a little messy a
little messy
yes my light Bellas are loud that is
correct you don't really notice it when
you're using the uh the
room drop
it now I don't know how many of you
didn't have anything better to do than
to watch my dog play this game but
thanks for joining me I'm going to go to
the gym now
I think we've done enough
