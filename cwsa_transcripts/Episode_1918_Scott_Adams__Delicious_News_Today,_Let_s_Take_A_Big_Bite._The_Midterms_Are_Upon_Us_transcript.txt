good morning everybody it's about time
you got here I've been sitting here
waiting
and may I say that you look smarter and
better looking nay sexier than I have
ever seen you before so good job on that
and you know what the funny thing is I
always say that you know that you you
look better and you look sexier but I
swear that this really happens
almost every day
a little technical problem almost every
day somebody contacts me personally
usually on social media to tell me how
much weight they lost
using systems over goals stuff that I
teach you
yesterday somebody said they lost 58
pounds
I saw the before and after picture
oh my God
you should see the difference when
somebody loses 58 pounds especially mail
because you know he went from uh I don't
know who's going to date that guy to I
think everybody wants to date that guy I
mean somebody sent me I won't name names
but somebody sent me a shirtless selfie
and I looked at it I was like yeah
you nailed that
anyway so almost every day I get that
women men somebody lost 25 pounds the
day before I heard that
yeah and I'm very proud of you
and I think this simultaneous sip is for
all of you
who have lost weight in fact while we're
doing the simultaneous sip if you've
lost weight because of using systems
versus goals stuff I teach in this book
over my shoulder how to fail to almost
everything and still went big if you did
just put your number up
so while we're doing the simultaneous up
just brag just tell me your number if
you lost weight using oh my God
somebody lost 100 pounds
yeah
oh my God all right
okay I'm just transfixed by this
is this real
now those of you who have not lost any
weight using this systems over goal
technique
which largely teaches you to increase
your knowledge
and then if you do that losing weight is
easy
so that that's the technique that's the
short version
look at these numbers if you have not
lost weight
are you not convinced that this works
this meaning developing A system that
works for you right everybody using
their own little system
but I just teach you how to develop your
own little system
wow
good job well let's uh bring it up a
notch and if you'd like to do that all
you need is a cup of micro glass of
tanker jealousest on the canteen yoga
class of a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including your weight apparently it's
called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
you know there's a report out of South
Korea
that there were nine a bunch of South
Korea miners who were trapped
underground for nine days
and they survived on coffee alone
to which I say
is there anything that coffee can do
I asked that on Twitter and and somebody
suggested there is one thing coffee
can't do
you can't not stain your fabric it can't
not stain your fabric to which I say
well that's why I don't wear pants when
I wear drink coffee
I mean if you're wearing pants while you
drink coffee you're just asking for
stain on your pants
so
um it does cause problems at Starbucks
Starbucks hates it well let me just put
that in there Starbucks just hates it
but I have not stained my pants in
Starbucks in a long time
um I have a uh entertainment content
recommendation for you in a world in
which
a world in which
um all movies are bad
can we stipulate
all movies are bad
I don't know when that started happening
but they're all bad
all right well I found something that I
watched that I enjoyed
and some of you have already seen it but
it's called My octopus teacher
the worst name for Content I've ever
seen in fact the name alone kept me from
watching it for a long time
because I didn't know what the hell is
it about and so I thought it was gonna
be like the shape of water which I also
didn't watch
um because I didn't want to see a human
fall in love with an octopus
because I thought that's kind of what it
was going to be oh I'm like oh God this
is gonna be like some stupid fiction
where a human falls in love with an
octopus well the first thing you need to
know it's a documentary
so it's not a movie it's a it's a
documentary movie I guess
and
uh the man actually falls in love with
the octopus
the man falls in love with the octopus
now
if that's the only thing you knew about
it
then I would say that doesn't quite
recommend it does it because it was a
little sort of close to bestiality he
doesn't actually have sex with the
octopus but it did look like it was
getting close
there there wasn't heavy padding of the
octopus
so I wouldn't let the kids watch
because it was at least R-rated action
with the octopus
you know if you know what I mean
I'm not sure where to touch an octopus
to be inappropriate but it seems to me
that almost anywhere
would be a little sketchy
right
no but here's why here's why I recommend
it here's why I recommend it whatever
you thought you knew about octopi
octopuses whatever you thought you knew
about them oh my God are you going to be
surprised
your mind will be blown about every five
minutes
about every five minutes you'll be
sitting there going what
what
an octopus did that
is trust me just trust me that you
cannot judge this by the name
or the general idea of it you have to
watch it for what an octopus can do
is like blows your head away
all right the other important story
we'll get to all the good news but I
like to I like to work up to it uh
there's new product uh developed in
Pittsburgh at this pittsburgh-based
startup CNN's reporting called shift
robotics they've got
um
I guess you could call them
battery-powered shoes
that make you walk uh two and a half
times faster
now they they look visually like a
multi-wheeled skates but they don't
operate like skates basically every step
you take gives you a little Glide but
it's a controlled Glide it's not not
like skates where you'd have to stop so
it's basically like you can walk slide
but really fast maybe that's a bad
definition because it's like walk roll
but it showed some people doing it and
it looks like it doesn't take any
any Talent right you don't it's not like
riding a bike where you have to at least
practice to do it I think you can just
put them on and start walking
and I gotta say
it looked really good
I I can imagine the sketching on I can
totally imagine it uh and I can also
imagine that I would use it for exercise
even though it's making it easier to
walk in the same way I use an e-bike
I still could exercise an e-bike I just
take it 20 miles instead of five miles
right and I still do Hills and yeah I
can turn down the the Boost as much as I
want so I think that could be a big
thing all right here's a
persuasion question
I saw on Twitter that uh Democrats are
gonna are trying to uh
stop calling gun control gun control and
call it gun safety what do you think
that what do you think about that
is that good persuasion to change it
from gun control
to gun safety
yes it is that is unambiguously a good
play
right it might be too late you know
people people have already decided on
guns so I'm not sure anybody can be
persuaded about anything but if you
wanted at least a chance of persuading
gun safety is really strong right that's
very strong
I'm going to tell you later about
Democrats getting everything wrong with
persuasion but on that one I'd say that
was the right play if you're just trying
to be persuasive
uh there's some weird extra information
about this uh yay story with his uh I
probably ex personal trainer now who had
threatened him in messages and yay
printed the messages on Twitter and the
message was that uh if yay didn't talk
to him I think on the topic of
apologizing for comments about the
Jewish community
that that this guy Harley Pasternak
would
have have a
institutionalized again and he used the
word again
I'll have you institutionalized again
and then you'll be drugged up so you'll
be in Zombieland and visiting your kids
will never be the same
he actually said that to another human
being
now my understanding is that they later
met and talked for a few hours although
you know
would you ever talk to somebody who said
that to you
would you have would you sit down and
have a polite conversation with somebody
who had just threatened to
institutionalize you and remove you from
your kids forever he's not even in your
family
it's just a guy that worked for
you
really would you take that from a guy
you hired
to help you you know because the trainer
does more than just your body right it's
sort of a little holistic situation
my God now I might take the meeting just
to punch the uh piss out of him
although he's a personal trainer so that
probably is a really bad idea I suppose
he he looks like he could he could
handle himself
um but there's some additional
conspiracy theory reporting that I find
interesting but not convincing
interesting but not convincing so I'm
only going to talk about this because
it's a fun speculation I would not put
any credibility behind it
but I'll give you the argument so
apparently Pastor dick has history with
training a number of other celebrities
some of whom did not meet a good end
and people are trying to make some kind
of a pattern here I don't see much in
that pattern because there's no
incentive you know it doesn't make sense
that one person would have you know
several bad outcomes with celebrities it
makes more sense to me
that celebrities are all messed up
and so if you're a personal trainer to
celebrities you're probably always
working with people who are you know on
the edge of
hurting themselves and stuff like that
so yeah so I wouldn't make anything from
the fact that he's trained some people
who came to bad ends and I think some
killed themselves or died and drug
addicts and stuff but I don't think
that's there's a causal argument there
just because it's you know Hollywood
people
um but he's got some connection to some
Canadian military
uh that people speculate that maybe he
has some official role
like like that the the powers who be are
are using him to get close to people
that they want to control
what do you think of the general let's
say the general concept
do you think it's a true thing
that in the context of politics
that the powers who be whoever you think
they are might not even be the same
people could be the powers to be on one
side versus the other side but just
whoever the powers are
do you believe it's a thing
that the powers who be would assign
somebody
to be like a secret Handler to somebody
whose voice they want to control do you
think it's a thing
now are you saying you think it's a
thing just because you suspect
everything bad is true or do you have
some evidence that you've ever heard of
it
in a real way have you ever confirmed it
in any way
like Fang Fang that's a good example
yeah Fang Fang is the perfect example
right
so I can give you a definitive answer to
this question
yes yes it's absolutely a thing
how do I know because it's happened to
me at least three times
at least three times the powers that be
have sent somebody to be my friend
okay now I can't guarantee
that any of the three
were really you know sent by Shady
organizations
but they were all associated with them
and they all ran the same play
right I'm not going to describe it to
you but if somebody tries a little bit
too hard to be your friend
they might be Fang Fang right now
nothing's happened to me that you know
reached a level where I would have to
get law enforcement involved or the FBI
or something so nothing nothing at that
level it's just that
people are trying to be your friend you
look at them you say
I don't think that's just you trying to
be my friend
that looks like you connected to people
who would like to control my voice a
little bit
so it's a thing it's a real thing
I have no reason to believe that it is
true in this case of yay's trainer I'd
bet against it
my bad is it's just an individual acting
like an individual
the most obvious thing but
um as the account restoring order I
don't know who this is just somebody on
Twitter
uh so that's the name of the account
restoring order does it has a long
thread making the case that uh there's
no way to know
if this speculation has any substance
but he closes I think it's a
by saying that if
if somebody were sent to manage yay
if that happened
that person would look exactly like this
person
and I do accept that
that's me that I accept which is
completely different from saying that
Pasternak has any you know role Beyond
being an interested party
it's just that it would look exactly
like that
right it would just look like that
so I don't think there's anything to it
but it's an interesting uh it's an
interesting exposure to a real thing
and the real thing is that people do try
to be your fake friends to influence you
that's a real thing
you also by now a Hostess from The View
Sunny Hosten that's right there's
somebody who's a host of a show whose
last name is Hosten
huh somebody named Hosten is host in the
show
probably a coincidence
um but
she said that white women voting
Republican is like roaches voting for
raid
now I and a number of other people said
whoa did you just compare white women to
roaches
did you just do that
now I have a confession
it's confession time
do you like it when I confess my true
motives
okay when I retweeted this and it got
like 10 000 likes and you know thousands
of retweets when I said that she
compared women to cockroaches white
women to cockroaches
I didn't really mean that
that was for Revenge and I don't feel
good about it because I don't have any
reason to have revenge against Sonny
Hosten because I have no no contact with
her this was revenge for something that
happened to be about 15 years ago
now I'm not going to surface the whole
story
but the most trouble I ever got into in
terms of getting canceled
was in a blog post about 15 years ago in
which I said something that I thought
people would understand to be funny
but they didn't
and what I did was I intentionally put a
list of three things
which was supposed to make you say hey
you're insulting women but when they
thought about it they'd realize I wasn't
and then that was the joke the joke was
that in your mind you'd think something
terrible had happened that I'd said
something really awful about women
but if you actually read it carefully
you say oh he's screwed with us he
didn't say that at all he worded it
carefully so we'd think that and that's
the joke all right
so here's what I said
that men
when it comes to arguing there are three
groups that men don't like to argue with
children
people who are mentally uh
mentally challenged and women
you see what trouble I got into and then
what did people say they took it out of
context and they said that I compared
women to mentally ill people
did I do that did I compare them
no I did not I did not compare them they
were in the same list
they were just in the list and that was
the funny part the the joke was that
nobody should compare those groups
that's that was my point right so if you
understood the joke
or you understood it was a joke you'd
realize that the people criticizing me
are on the same side as me
which is you would never compare
children and the mentally disabled and
women
like that wouldn't make any sense
but when they said hey you're insulting
Woman by comparing them to the mentally
disabled
I could have argued the details and said
but you're also do you think I also
compared babies to the mentally disabled
like are they all being compared to each
other or did I compare nobody right the
truth is I didn't compare anybody
nobody was compared to anybody the joke
was if you felt like they were being
compared the joke's on you
the joke's on you if you thought they
were being compared
that was the joke
but instead
since a third of the country wouldn't
know what a joke looks like I've taught
you that before right literally
literally a third of the country can't
even identify a joke they don't know
mostly I brought this on myself so I'm
not absolving myself from guilt if you
say something that's unclear
and it's your job to say clear things
that's my job my job is to say clear
things and it wasn't clear
so I brought that on myself but I got uh
that probably cost me 30 of all my
future income
forever
yeah do you know how much money that was
it was really expensive that was one
sentence
that got me probably one-third canceled
forever that never came back
because basically women said oh he's a
misogynist and they left completely fake
news 100 of fake news so when I saw this
Sonny Houston thing I said
huh
that looks familiar
this looks like the exact thing
that got me canceled or one-third
canceled forever
so I thought to myself huh I wonder if
other people will take it the same way
so I tweeted it and everybody did the
the Republicans did to her to Sunny host
and the same thing that you know I don't
know what what group they were but
people did to me
they canceled me for
intentionally not understanding the
point
right
now do you think Sunny hosten's Point
was that white women are like
cockroaches
no
no of course it wasn't her point was
they were doing something that's bad for
them
right which actually is showing showing
interest and compassion in white women
that she would prefer they did something
that was good for them
the context is
you know how can white women do
something that's good for them they
should do that instead of something
that's bad for them now is that
anti-white
if you're saying you wish white women
would do things that are good for white
women
not really I mean but if you say to me
what if that had been reversed
you know what what if a white person had
said that black people you know the
usual thing you do the thing where you
just change the group and then it sounds
terrible
you'd all agree with that right if you
change the ethnicity it would sound way
over the line
and so I think it's fair that people
said this is also Over The Line
because there needs to be some pushback
that you can't on white women even
if it's sort of just casual language and
it wasn't your point you can't even do
it don't do it accidentally either
because that's a standard that I would
accept the other direction right if
somebody said to me Scott I know you
didn't mean to insult whatever group
but don't talk that way because we take
it that way I would say oh that's a
pretty good point I will not talk that
way because you take it that way do you
think I have ever once made that mistake
I made when I put women and children and
the mentally disabled in a list just for
joke purposes I will never make that
mistake again
because the public pushed back on me now
I hate the fact that I got canceled you
know one-third canceled
but
uh it's not a bad thing that the public
pushes back
right I have a little mixed feeling
about it maybe they should have pushed
back on me maybe they should have not
canceling me but they should push back a
little Maybe
all right
apparently there's a thing now called uh
you know you've heard of diversity
but the trouble with diversity is uh a
third of a white college applicants were
claiming they were black to get benefits
so the diversity thing was wasn't
working because people ever everybody
wanted to claim they were a
disadvantaged person it kind of ruins
the entire narrative
what we can claim we're black I'm
hitting can I claim I'm black hey hey
everybody we can play more black now
it's legal well let's all claim we're
black they didn't see that coming
right I I think they they did not say
that people would say uh not only am I
not a racist but if you're giving me the
option I'm going to join your
team
I mean you can't be any you can't be
I don't think you could be less racist
than actually joining the team which is
what I've done that's why I've
identified as black for a few years now
and it's worked for me it's worked for
me
uh but now there's a thing called visual
diversity meaning that if you're a
school for example Wall Street Journal
has an article in this today uh that if
you're a school and somebody is diverse
but you couldn't tell by looking at them
it's not good enough
and this is not even about what your
actual ethnicity is you have to look at
because if you don't look diverse
it's not working
um
so
this brings me
to my favorite point of the night did
anybody watch Tucker Carlson last night
now I'm going to point out something
that I notice is this bigger than Tucker
Carlson all right so I turned it on and
Tucker Carlson did an entire comedy uh
segment
in which all he did was show the actual
uh clips of Democrats talking recently
like you know professional talkers I'm
not talking about on the street I'm
talking about
um you know MSNBC hosts and hosts of
other big news programs
and
I I don't know how to explain this
he didn't have to add anything and it
was the funniest thing you've ever seen
you didn't have to add the joke
it was a comedy segment of just showing
Democrats talking
for example why I'm Joy Reid what the my
favorite segment was Joy Reid explaining
that Republicans are using this word
inflation that people don't understand
and they've like invented a new word for
politics that people had never even
thought about it wasn't really part of
their world but suddenly Republicans
have made this artificial
like completely imaginary thing called
inflation and turns it into a topic when
in fact people don't even know what that
word means
now do I have to add anything to that
is that not hilarious
I mean I could say the obvious things
such as we've been talking about
inflation with politics since the Carter
years that anybody with even the
slightest association with politics
knows exactly what it means we could go
into you know again it seems racist
yeah because it's racist as black people
can't get ID to vote
and the rest of us who are not racists
go I've never met any black people who
couldn't get an ID to vote
I'm never but I've never met anybody
that dumb you know of any race like they
all seem to be able to because you could
always just ask somebody
couldn't you like no matter how much you
know you could just ask somebody who
knows it's the easiest thing in the
world so anyway
just think about the fact that comedy
movies are no longer a thing would you
agree
the the Hollywood gave up on making
comedy movies because comedy doesn't
make sense anymore you know with all the
wokeness but that the news remember how
long have I been telling you the news is
the new comedy
I that's not hyperbole
the the thing that makes me laugh the
hardest most consistently is just the
news
and the fact that that Tucker no longer
has to add anything to the news he can
literally just show the clip
and just laugh and then we just laugh
with them ah that was pretty funny
now
here's why I think it's extra funny
right now
correct me if I'm wrong but the
Democrats probably feeling a little bit
backed into a corner
and they realize that most of their
issues were imaginary
and the Republicans were focusing on
real things
now of course the Democrats say the
opposite because they think inflation's
imaginary
they also think crime is imaginary or at
least the extent of it and that the
Border problems kind of imaginary
and they and tiger also I think Tucker
showed it the news
saying that Fox News they keep focusing
on crime uh inflation and uh immigration
and and the other news we're saying you
know why do they keep focusing on those
things to which I said
Could It Be I'm just going to throw this
out there
that they're also the topics that the
public most cares about
now you're saying that we fear them but
that's why we care them care the most if
you do assert if you do a poll of what
issues
do do does the public care about
would it match up with what Fox news
reports every night or would it match up
with
um
CNN and MSNBC which would match
I mean it's a no-brainer
if you've looked at the polls
the public is interested in exactly the
same stuff that not exactly maybe but
but very close to what Fox news reports
every night
and and news organizations
criticized Fox News for reporting the
thing that even the news organizations
know the public cares most about
course the problem is
why does the public care most about
those issues
might be because FOX News tells them to
so you do have this problem that people
care about what they're told to care
about you know their opinions are
somewhat assigned but
I think there's a difference with crime
and inflation
nobody needs to be told there's crime
if they experience it like even my
neighborhood is more dangerous this year
and I live in a really safe neighborhood
and it's more dangerous it's like
literally more dangerous
and
I don't know I think people's lived
experiences just making the Democrats
crazy because there's nothing they can
lie about and get away with anymore
except for their own base I guess
um
foreign
article in Breitbart
um Rasmussen is having some problems
with their polling
and one one assumes that others are
others are having the same problem but
we only know because rasmussen's
reporting it
that apparently the online polling
portion of their polls
a number of people are identifying as a
republican but then voting for like a
senator who's a Democrat
now you might say to yourself well
that's not unusual people split tickets
that's that's a thing
except that nobody's doing it the other
way
there are no examples of people who look
like they're totally Democrats but
they're going to vote for Republican
Senators
and and if it were just sort of a thing
that Ordinary People Can you know split
their votes if that were a thing it
would work both ways but it's only going
one way
which suggests that the polls are not
dependable
so what would be worse than going into a
midterms with the polling companies
telling you the polls are not dependable
that's sort of a sort of gas and
and uh and lighter isn't it it's sort of
a dangerous situation to be going into a
midterm
talk more about that
um
all right
um
Molly Hemingway
uh writing for the Federalist and by the
way if you're not following Molly
Hemingway I've often called her out as
probably the best
um political pundit who is working at
the moment
I was also a writer I say of people who
are also writers best political pundit
um so I whenever whenever she does
anything I always pay attention to it
but here's something that hasn't been
reported enough
to Republicans right so here's something
you want to hear that you probably
haven't heard enough
she writes the Republican National
Committee other party entities and
dozens of public interest election
non-profit groups built over the last
two years a multi-million dollar
election Integrity infrastructure the
past loss improving mode ID and other
election security measures defended
those laws from legal attacks by
democrats and sued States and localities
have failed to follow the law they also
recruited educated trained and placed
tens of thousands of new election
observers and other workers throughout
the long midterm voting season
so one thing that you're not quite
appreciating is the extent to which
Republicans ramped up
right because if what happened in 2020
and I think there's a good argument for
the only thing that happened that was
weird in 2020 was pandemic related
changes that the Democrats pushed
through that worked out
so
it could be that the Republicans have
matched their game just in terms of
being able to watch things and control
things and you know make it a little
safer I don't know if any of this makes
a difference
I don't have any sense of whether this
was enough but it's good to know that
the Republicans were not
sitting doing nothing they did stuff
um what do you think of the Democrats
play they're all saying now it's a new
talking point that on the midterms
democracy is on the ballot
is it strong or Not Strong
it's super weak
do you think they know it
do you think the Democrats know it's
super weak let me start by saying why
it's super weak here's what's strong
build a wall
because you can see it right
and you can also feel the danger
because what are you building the wall
for well some kind of economic or other
threat
so there's fear
and there's visual persuasion in build
the wall
how about uh crime is overtaking your
cities
good persuasion very good because crime
is scary and you can also visualize it
can't you visualize crime right you see
somebody you see riots and stuff people
get mugged
now now try to visualize this
uh democracy is on the ballot
oh I'm so scared now
about your concept that is so generic it
is said on every election
there's no visual
there's no Visual and there's no fear
because do you know what's on the ballot
every year
democracy
democracy is always on the ballot that's
where you want it
now Tucker did a funny thing where he
held up a ballot and he looked for the
Democracy vote and it wasn't there
but I would go the other direction
yes democracy is on the ballot
it absolutely is on the ballot and don't
let the Democrats take it off
because the Democrats would like to take
it off the ballot
well that would be that that would be
the attack Vector I'm not saying that
they do
um
you so I would agree and amplify
if I'm a republican I would say
Democrats have told you democracy is on
the ballot this is the one thing we can
agree on democracy is always on the
ballot if you don't vote
you're you're letting you know the evil
creep in
democracy is always on the ballot
Republicans could take their entire
um frame and use it without an
explanation
imagine if you could take the other
side's slogan and use it without
explanation
that is the worst slogan you could ever
 have if the other team could
just say it and they don't even have to
like add the you know we took it from
the Democrats and what they mean is this
but well you don't have to add anything
you just say democracy is on the ballot
you're done
because it's always on the ballot
democracy says on the ballot do you know
what that tells me to do
what's it tell you to do democracy says
on the ballot what are you going to do
oh I'd vote
yeah I'd vote
so I mean it really it just comes down
to uh you should vote kind of thing and
both sides want people to vote so it
works just as well both ways
total failure
or is it
why do you think the Democrats who know
how to hire professionals who know how
to persuade
you know the Democrats know how to do
that they do have people who know what
they're talking about
they know how to listen to them
they know how to execute
but they're not
why would they have a slogan
that is clearly not useful
well what would be a reason for that
um
well there is a reason
and I'll tell you
[Applause]
foreshadowing
yeah it's foreshadowing
have you noticed the pattern that the
Democrats uh pre
they pre-accused Republicans of whatever
they're planning to do
you've noticed the pattern right
if they're planning to do something
they're going to start by saying that oh
those Republicans are going to do this
thing and then when it happens you're
going to say oh the Democrats warned us
there's those Republicans who who else
uses that technique where have you seen
that technique used recently
do you recognize it where somebody
blames you as something they're going to
do where have you seen that
the Russians
the Russians have warned the world that
the ukrainians might try to use a dirty
bomb some kind of tactical Nuclear
situation
that's right when the Russians tell you
that the ukrainians are planning to use
a dirty bomb
that tells you the Russians might use a
dirty bomb
does anybody disagree with that it's
just sort of obvious right
literally that's the way it's reported
every news story says Ah there's those
Russians
they're uh those Russians are you know
projecting and and they're setting up
their their excuse in advance
this is exactly what the Democrats are
doing there the reason that they're
using such a weak slogan
there's only one reason they would use a
weak slogan
because they need to they need to put
your focus on the on blaming the
Republicans for the thing they plan to
do
I can't see another reason
if you assume the Republicans are
completely incompetent then you can
imagine that they sat around and said
hey how about saying democracy is you
know is on trial something like that
you put um you put Axelrod in that room
just just work with me you put David
Axelrod in the room does he say yeah
that's the way to go
does he
I don't think so
maybe but I don't think so
I think he would advise against it
I don't know I think you advised you
know maybe do something stronger
so
the signal that they're sending
is that they're setting us up for a
stolen election
now I'm not saying that they are
I'm saying that these signals they're
sending us are unambiguous
would you agree
which doesn't mean it's true
I'm just saying the signals are really
clear it could be false signals but
they're really clear
all right why would they send us clear
signals that they're going to cheat on
the election
why would they do that because most
people don't pick up the signal
right most people can't see it if you're
following enough you start to recognize
the players
and the patterns
right
you wouldn't recognize the you remember
Nancy Pelosi explained the wrap-up smear
where you leak something to the news the
news reports it and then you say Well it
must be true because it's in the news
but you're the one that gave them the
news once you once you recognize their
tricks you see that they just do the
same ones over and over again all right
so here's your signal to tell you
whether it happened or not
if John Brennan
comes out after the midterms and let's
say there's an unexpected result let's
say Democrats do way better than you
thought
and John Brennan comes out to tell you
that the election was fair you know it
wasn't
because they only bring him out for the
big lies like the laptop and the rush
inclusion
they don't even bring him out for the
little stuff
am I right they only bring him out for
big lies he's like their go-to utility
guy big lie guy and and the same with
Bernstein Bernstein Stein they only
bring him out when they need somebody to
say something's worse than the Watergate
so once you understand the players
that now who who do they bring out I'll
give you another example of this who did
the Democrats bring out
if there's a question of something
that's a secret document
but they want you to believe that
somebody saw this secret document and
it's really much worse than you could
imagine
Chef right it will always be chef
right so once you recognize who the
players are
you know exactly what the play is
because they only use some players for
some types of plays
and Brennan is the one you want to look
for
if Brennan goes on one of the national
news and says these Republicans are
crazy this election was Totally Secure
you I guarantee it wasn't
I guarantee it wasn't now if if they
don't bring Brennan out
and it's just you know experts and
people actually know what they're
talking about let's say let's say uh
they the only people you're from are
like the attorney who is it runs the
elections
in each state the uh what's the name of
the job of who runs the election in each
state state Secretary of State so so if
the only people we hear from are the
secretaries of State
and the Secretary of the State say this
election was fine
right yeah the election was fine and
some of them would be Republicans and
some of them would be Democrats right
but if you heard from that group and
that group said yeah you know I ran the
election and I did a good job and I took
care of it might be true
but if the only person who goes on TV
saying this election was absolutely fair
is John Brennan
that they couldn't signal that more
clearly
so we'll see
uh worst case scenario for Democrats
might be evolving
which is they try to rig the election
and get caught
that's actually possible
because the Republicans are going to be
looking under every Rock behind every
pole they're going to be watching every
Dropbox which may not be a good idea
especially if they're looking menacing
because you don't want to give the
Democrats too many reasons to say
that the election was rigged the other
way
you know don't don't put the arm to
people at the drop boxes that's a bad
idea
um
but watching them with a trail cam might
not be a bad idea
is very reason you couldn't put a trail
cam at every Dropbox
or put a trail cam at all the important
ones
is it even illegal to put your own trail
cam up in public
I guess it'd be stolen pretty quickly
all right
um
let's talk about Twitter
so apparently the Twitter curation team
that on on social media people are
saying the entire
curation moderation content group got
fired that's not true right
so there's a new emerging star in the
Twitter universe which is uh sort of
fascinating
which is uh Joel Roth
and he tweeted a long explanation I
think 15 of that group uh did get laid
off
but it's not changing much about what
they do so nothing's changed yet
so don't worry about those people being
laid off
um they will be replaced Etc
now
um
so musk continues to be hilarious on
Twitter Dan Rather tweeted this is musk
running Twitter like Trump ran his
casinos
it's kind of a up thing to say
isn't it like that's just such a
such a useless troll thing to say
because
you know literally Elon Musk is the most
successful entrepreneur
of all time
and an idiot Dan Rather is asking if
he's going to run it like Trump's
casinos which would be an example of
something that didn't work out
business-wise at all all right now why
would he even ask that question like
that's just purely an insult right
there's there's no news value it's not
even an opinion it's just a public
insult right so so what does must say
when Dan Rather
publicly insults them is musk running
Twitter like Trump ran casinos musk
tweets back eight dollars
perfect
yeah he he's used that joke a few times
now but it gets funnier every time he
uses it right because he's now just
shortened it to eight dollars
and and I love I love
how that reframes the situation right
because it could have been a fight
but he reframed it as not a fight it's
like thank you very much that was eight
dollars worth of value you got out of
that eight dollars please
it's really is really strong
all right
here's a persuasion question just for
your general uh knowledge it's too late
to make this change
but suppose just imagine if the first
time you heard that musk wanted to
introduce an eight dollar fee right it's
too late now but imagine the first time
you heard it he said I'm only going to
give you one thing for that
I'm gonna make sure that it suppresses
the Bots and and the trolls
that's all you get
for eight dollars you can take Bots and
trolls out of your life mostly couldn't
get them all
now how would you feel about that
versus the current thing where you start
negotiating it you know in real time
with the users which is fascinating by
the way I love that but what it does is
it gives you too many things to think
about
so now I'm thinking okay for eight
dollars would I be happy if I could say
maybe edit some things or I've got a
little tag or or you know maybe the
other comments or you know different or
something like that now if I try to
think through those things what happens
to me
I automatically make a comparison and
what is the automatic comparison
the automatic comparison is free free
Twitter
versus paying for the thing that used to
be free
if you're talking about a feature set
and people largely didn't know they
needed the features right most Twitter
users just go and they tweet and they go
home they're not like oh my life will be
complete if I had this feature not
really like we talk about the edit
button but it doesn't matter that much
right you know most of it doesn't really
matter so if you talk about a bunch of
features that you might get for eight
dollars
people's brains automatically compare
free which was working fine
to paid
in the context of inflation and
everything seems too expensive now
that's not really the best comparison is
it
but if the only thing you're compete
you're comparing it to is those damn
Bots
and I said for eight dollars you can get
rid of them but you don't need to
you can have exactly the same experience
it's up to you or you could have the no
bot experience whichever you like
that would actually be a stronger so
this is an example persuasion wise this
is an example of less is more
a hundred percent of people would say I
don't want Bots right 100 of people but
what happened when you saw people
talking about the features
when we talked about features people
disagreed
if you talk about Bots nobody disagrees
now you could argue if that's worth
eight dollars or not that's a different
argument
right so I'm not saying he should have
done it differently because I like I
love the fact that he's designing uh the
product in public and you're getting an
MBA value class of just watching him try
to navigate this situation it's the most
interesting business thing
you've ever seen
would anybody argue with that
you we have never watched a business
development with this level of
transparency combined with this level of
you know dollar value combined with this
importance
combined with the time the times are
important right midterms are approaching
so everything about this is interesting
and musk has added that by making you
know his his thought process transparent
uh the the amount you're going to learn
by watching him navigate this even if he
makes mistakes right the mistakes are
going to teach you something in him too
I suppose if he makes any so you are
getting educated like nobody's business
I said the same thing about Trump
remember how much you learned about the
government just how it works because of
trump
Trump was like a college course you know
no matter what you thought of him you
learned so much about how things are
supposed to work
um anyway I'm loving all that part of it
so
uh musk reports that Twitter had a
massive drop in Revenue because the
activists I don't know if they're Soros
people some people are saying that I
don't know if that's confirmed but some
activists are having
putting pressure on advertisers to drop
out
and as musk says it's extremely messed
up and they're trying to destroy free
speech in America
that is literally what they're doing
am I wrong
because
yeah I mean they are literal I don't
think that's even hyperbole they are
literally trying to
degrade
um the biggest source of free speech
they're trying to put the the one place
where you could imagine Free Speech
could happen
and and it's also big you know there are
smaller places you could imagine that
but it's a
it's pretty big and then somebody you
said tell us those advertisers so we'll
you know we could respond by not buying
their you know boycott the
boycotters and must said a thermonuclear
name and shame is exactly what will
happen if this continues
I have a suggestion
just pick three
I don't know how many there are pick
your top three
and you see if we can make their stock
dip I bet we can you don't think that
let's say half of Twitter or whatever
percentage would participate you don't
think a half of Twitter
could Bend somebody's stock
price
you could bend the out of it
now you don't have to even be like
permanent non-customers
you could just send a warning shot you
could give them one month of 20 Decline
and no CEO can survive that a CEO cannot
survive a 20 decline because of a CO
decision
can't survive it yeah so we you could
probably take out three CEOs in one
month
worth a shot
I think they have it coming
although they you know the CEOs are
probably just operating on fear I doubt
the CEOs are operating on anything but
fear
but you could you know you could balance
out the fear so at least the CEO can
make a business decision instead of a
fear decision
um
I saw a button that appeared I've only
seen it once on Twitter that only
appeared on Elon musk's Twitter feed and
it was a notice that says readers added
context
and then very noticeably you can see
what context you know little summary and
then you could say oh there's a story
that explains more about what he's
saying now I saw that for the first time
today has anybody else seen that
did you see it from the first time
and was it only on musk's account
I'd never seen it now does that look
exactly like what I described they
should do
can somebody give me a fact check here
is it exactly what I described they
should do just allow us to attach
context
you don't have to say what's right or
wrong just allow the best counter
argument
to be surface that's all just just allow
the best counter argument to be
noticeable
I feel like they did it
like this this is like is so small it's
not even news
and might be the biggest thing that's
happened in 10 years
do you know how big that is what would
happen if people had access to the
counter argument
it's never happened the news can't do it
CNN can't do it Fox News can't do nobody
else can do it
Twitter is literally the only entity
that has any ability to show you both
sides
and that magnificent bastard you may
have already implemented it it looks
like it might be beta
he may have already fixed it if you look
at the the rapid change they I think
you're going to see I think you'll see
some rapid upgrades it's going to be
breathtaking I think
from from a business nerd perspective I
say breathtaking from the perspective of
not just what it's doing for the country
free speechwise but as a business nerd
you know watching business models being
created in real time this I just doesn't
get any better than that
um
all right
so uh
Thomas Massey had a representative
Massey had a very interesting comment on
Twitter today
um it was based on the fact that there
are these layoffs that are happening at
Twitter and uh representative Massey
says I wonder how many painstakingly
curated
clandestine government connections
within Twitter Elon Musk has already
serendipitously severed as a result of
the reorg it could take a year uh it
could take years to re-establish those
valuable points of influence now he's
using some big words here
so Thomas Massey
your audience is not as smart as you you
might want to lay off the Serendipity
just dial back the Serendipity part like
I guess go smaller words on Twitter
on one hand yeah on one hand don't you
love that you have a elected
representative who went to MIT and isn't
afraid to look smart
okay I love that I love that so maybe
he's playing it right but I think his
point maybe got lost a little bit and
it's a good one so we were talking about
how
um
clandestine government connections
can act like your friend
do you think that Executives or maybe
key Engineers within Twitter
had friends had friends that sort of
popped up when those people found out
what jobs they had
sort of sort of instant friends who were
like trying really hard to be their
friend and maybe offer them some
benefits that you wonder why
yeah now I think Thomas Massey is 100
accurate there's no doubt
that Democrats had cultivated friends
within Twitter
there's no doubt is there would you
doubt that
of course it happened
now some of it might have been just
natural it might not be part of some you
know big plan it could be just who they
hung out with but definitely the
personal connections between the powers
and the engineers who control the
algorithm it's very possible that musk
severed those connections
it's very possible he did
yeah or let me put it this way if
foreign countries are not already
embedding their own employees or
influencing employees at Twitter
why not
we would do it
do you think the United States wouldn't
try to embed their own people in Twitter
if Twitter were let's say a Chinese
company
of course I would
of course we would
like if they didn't what are they doing
what are we paying you for
right yeah and yeah maybe they've all or
maybe the cia's already embedded in Tick
Tock so we don't know who's embedded
where but uh I do like uh hearing from
an elected representative that at least
one very smart person
thinks it's obvious that Twitter had
influenced people on his staff that's
just obvious
uh Bill Maher
has joined the
the I guess democracies at risk crowd
and
here's what he said he predicted that
once Republicans uh and this is sort of
uh scaring you about the future that if
Republicans retake both chambers of
Congress
they'll begin impeaching Biden and never
stop over a myriad of things making the
president a quote crippled duck when he
goes up against Trump and Kerry Lake
ticket in 2024 so Bill Maher is already
calling Kerry Lake as the likely uh
running mate for 2024. so so okay I hear
the complaint
that if Republicans take over it'll be
like an impeachment
uh Frenzy
what's missing from that opinion
what's missing from the opinion
whether the impeachments would be
justified
right
doesn't that matter
doesn't it yeah I mean can we just
ignore the question of whether said
impeachments would be good for the
country or completely deserved
I think it matters right now I'm I don't
like having
um each team just suing and you know
impeaching the other team Non-Stop
but
it does seem to me that the Democrats
have some impeachable stuff and it does
seem to be that the Republicans have to
pay them back for what they did to Trump
I feel like payback might be important
like sometimes it creates this infinite
you know series of payback payback for
death but sometimes it's why you need to
brush back the batter right
sometimes you need to throw a brush back
pitch just to say well you can do it all
you want but we're going to do it back
to you so maybe we shouldn't do it
now I don't think they're ever going to
end up with less of it so I think we're
in this permanent impeachment hell and
I'm not looking forward to it but I
think you can't leave out the would it
be appropriate to impeach somebody
mayorka is one of those people that
people talk about
about because of the Border
anyway
um
then uh let's see what else did Bill
Maher says
um Bill Maher says that even if Trump
loses it doesn't matter on inauguration
day 2025 he's going to show up whether
he's on the list or not and this time
he's not going to take no for an answer
because this time he'll have behind him
the army of election deniers that are
going to be elected at the same time
there are about 300 candidates on the
ballot he says who don't believe in
ballots well that's what he says they
don't believe in balance
okay uh let me ask you
if there is a election and Trump loses
would you be willing to Stage an
insurrection
to keep him in power even though the
election said he lost go how many of you
are willing to join the insurrection
to keep the person who lost the election
in power
yeah nobody nobody zero
there isn't there isn't even a little
bit of energy for that
did do you know what do you know what
you would see if there were any energy
for that
here's what it would look like every
night on the news
MSNBC would show you a person on the
street interview with a Republican
who said I don't care what the vote is
Trump's my president and I've got
weapons
don't you think if those people existed
you don't think they'd find them
you don't think they could find people
who would say that if they existed
the reason you've never heard anybody
say that
is because they don't exist
the the Democrats have a thoroughly
imaginary platform you know inflation
isn't real and crime isn't up and uh
immigration doesn't matter and I mean
it's all imaginary the whole
thing it's all imaginary
yeah
now
um what is the proper thing to do if the
election is held and you don't believe
the results
let's let's uh let's game the sound
let's say you really really really
wanted the Republican to win whoever it
is let's say it's Trump you really
really wanted to win and the election
says he barely narrowly lost what are
you going to do about it
what are you going to do
are you going to support a march on the
capitol
would you would you support any kind of
uh
um The Electoral College uh like
overthrowing or not voting the way the
voters went
yeah nothing
nothing
um
here's my take and I I realize none of
you are going to accept this but I'll
tell you my take
if the election is rigged
that is also the election
there's a reason that I accepted the
2020 election immediately as soon as the
election was called I said that's my
president
and I'm it's not my first choice but
Biden's my president
because the system elected him
if that system also has some cheating in
it well both sides have access to
cheating
yeah if they if one side down cheated a
little bit and it was a close election
and it tipped it one when that was the
election
so I prefer that the election goes
exactly where the voters are I prefer
that
but my second choice
is that if there's some cheating and we
don't find it
as long as long as the two candidates
were roughly you know equally liked by
the country which is always the case
right by the time you get to the
election it's always a close election do
you really think that democracy
is destroyed because the person with 48
of the vote beat the person with 49
percent
like it is is democracy destroyed
because of that
here's the thing we our our elections
are not so bad that somebody like Putin
could win with 90 of the vote if the
public didn't actually lean in that
direction right so
I accept the cheating as part of the
system
whichever way it goes if it had been
Republicans or if it had been Democrats
as long as that cheating is below the
level where
you can identify it and as long as the
two candidates are kind of close
and they're
okay you know I know I have a preference
for who gets elected and so do you we
have a preference
but when it's so close
you know just being keep in mind that
you live in a country where there are
just as many people who prefer the other
thing and if you can't live with that
then democracy is not for you right the
fact that you don't get everything you
want
it doesn't work that way
now I do think we should push as hard as
humanly possible to make sure there's no
even opportunity for anything the fact
that our elections are not decided the
same day
when we know that that's possible
because other countries do it right
there's no doubt
that we have the technology the
resources the knowledge everything
to have paper ballots count them the
same day do it like Israel does it for
example that's just one example we know
we could do that
what would be any reason given that we
would not do that there's only one
reason an intention to cheat
am I wrong
what would be another reason
what would be another reason to favor a
system to favor A system that you know
the public finds not credible
why would the people in power want a
system that both sides say is not
credible if the other team wins both
sides don't like it
only the leaders like it why is that
there's only one reason
there is only one reason
right there's not a second possibility
they think it's to their advantage
how could it be to their advantage
because somebody's going to cheat
I here's here's something I wonder
do you think that the heads of the
Democrat and Republican parties do you
think that the heads actually know how
much cheating is happening at the
precinct level
I'll bet they don't
uh you think so
I think they have the same suspicion
most of us do but I'll bet they don't
I'll bet they don't know how much
cheating is going to happen in this next
election and I'll go further
they probably make sure that nobody
tells them
right because remember every any kind of
communication is discoverable
including somebody testifying that they
had the conversation so
it should be sort of a mafia situation
where the people if if you speculate
that there's any Badness that could
happen in the election so this is just
speculation if if you speculate that
it's a real thing
the people like Nancy Pelosi would
probably say do not tell me anything
about this
I don't want to hear about anything
that's happening that sounds sketchy by
my team
just don't tell me because when I go on
TV I want to say I don't know anything
about that
right right
if you were in charge you would say
don't tell me
because if it works it works and if it's
not happening then nobody told you it
doesn't matter
that's your best play don't tell me so I
don't think the heads actually know
they probably don't know
um
yeah let's see what else is going on
that's about it
I'm going to play one little uh audio
clip
so yesterday
oh did I lose my audio clip
so yesterday uh while I'm minding my own
business just watching that
documentary
at about the same time this was
happening
this is Elon Musk
in an interview that happened yesterday
at about the same time
let's see if it plays at the right
planet
will I have a technical problem
for crash safety so then I called the
crash safety team and said is this for
crash safety and said oh no that would
because that didn't do anything we
should delete it
I turned out to be totally useless they
forgot to tell the production team so so
honestly a bunch of these things just
feel like you're living in a Dilbert
cartoon
I'm like oh no what's that what I mean
any given company they said like what's
your Dilbert ratio okay it's not zero
so is this is this you or is this
try to keep it low so so is this you or
is this so you do all these different so
this is yesterday Elon Musk
telling an interviewer
um that you want to keep your Dilbert
ratio as low as possible
let me give you some update on the
Dilbert ratio now the Dilbert ratio
um I've seen it work two different ways
all right I interpret it a little bit
differently than some other do and it
has to do with how many Dilbert comics
are on the wall at your business and the
the dilber ratio says that if there are
too many Builder comics on the walls
that's a sign of bad management
but I add to that the worst sign of bad
management like the most strongest sign
of bad management
is no Dilbert cartoons on your wall
that's that's your worst case scenario
you know why right because it means they
can't even they can't even speak
honestly
you know they can't have an opinion they
can't be individuals basically
yeah so I mean this is just for fun it's
not like a scientific thing but uh
um somebody asked me after this after I
tweeted this uh
is it obvious is it becoming more
obvious that I'm somehow Central to the
simulation
to which I try to uh I tried to reply to
that
and Twitter wouldn't let me
it hung up and then I lost the lost the
tweet
now that's exactly what the simulation
would do if the simulation were designed
so that you couldn't find out you're in
a simulation
it would sort of not let you see a tweet
you know it would sort of act like that
now I'm not saying that's what's
happening it was just a funny
coincidence
but uh
imagine being me
just think about it there were seven and
a half billion people in the world
only one of them is the richest person
and also the person that's in the news
all the time
and
and then somehow I got pulled into the
headline now this isn't a headline it's
just something that happened but
how did I get pulled into this
I haven't told you how many things that
are in the headlines that I'm actually
involved in
for various reasons I don't talk about
it but if you or me
you could not believe that any of this
is real
in my life so exceeds
anything that could be like a a
realistic you know the you just got
lucky or it's a coincidence or something
like that it's just too weird
just too weird
there's although the weak ego people are
deciding in James anybody else have a
weak ego
we would like to feel uncomfortable that
I said a true fact which has obvious
relevance to my audience would make me
look good
is anybody else who's offended or are
you threatened by that
would anybody else like to insult me for
simply reporting an important thing that
happened on the news today
anybody come on
I know you're there let's go
yeah just admit you have a week ago and
then if anybody succeeds at anything it
makes you uncomfortable just go ahead
and say it
just be uncomfortable with other
people's success
is it is it Jordan Peterson who says
I think he I think he said it recently
that the people you should spend time
with are the people who celebrate your
success
and if somebody won't celebrate your
success like genuinely like they're
genuinely happy for your success
stay away from them
have you ever had anybody who is
important in your life
it was important in your life
uh
yeah well I don't have to finish that
all right
uh
so Arden says uh God do I hate Jordan
Peterson let me follow up with that
so Jordan Peterson elicits you know lots
of strong responses both way well what
is the argument for disliking I don't
know that I've ever heard it
there are things which I disagree with
not very often by the way I agree with
him 98 of the time but why would you
dislike him
what would be the arguments I'm I'm
looking over here on YouTube give me
just in one word or sentence or
something
um
God has chosen me well that's one way to
look at
um
make friends with people want the best
for you that yes his quote
but some people said you hated him but
just give me a reason I mean
I think I think it's a it would be a
reasonable opinion if he has some
something to back it with
he doesn't return your calls he's not
woke
yeah now but it's okay to disagree with
his opinions but why would he have a
problem with him
see here's my thing
Jordan Peterson is you know involved in
a business model in which he could make
you know good money doing what he does
but
I'm almost positive
that he like oh he's arrogant somebody
says
is that the problem
the problem that he's arrogant
um
I mean I could see that because he is
somebody says he's not arrogant are you
kidding
you you think Jordan Peterson is not
arrogant
that would be like saying I'm not
arrogant
nobody believes that do they
well here's the thing I would define
arrogant as somebody who would insult
somebody who disagrees with them
intellectually
does Jordan Peterson insult people who
disagree with him intellectually
I think he does that all the time right
I think I do that all the time too
aren't we both pretty arrogant
isn't that why you watch
it's a big part of the show the big part
of the show is saying we're smarter than
our critics
like that's half of what I do is tell
you I'm smarter than my credits you know
directly or indirectly I'm usually
trying to make the argument but directly
or indirectly
we're both pretty arrogant you don't do
this job this job meaning somebody who
talks to lots of people all the time you
don't do this job without being arrogant
do you
I mean I suppose if you're like a
religious leader you could pull it off
but if you're just a person who talks
about politics
I think we all run down the intellect of
the people who disagree with us
pretty sure we all do that
you know I'm not proud of it it's just
something that happens
you say neither of us I I do
I do I I run down the intellect of
people who disagree with me I was doing
that today
when I talked about Joy Reed
I was very arrogantly putting myself
above her
wasn't it
well isn't that obvious that I was
putting my own intellect above hers
overtly I wasn't trying to hide it
but here's maybe this is why you didn't
notice because I put your intellect over
hers as well
maybe that's why you didn't notice
because I I guess I was arrogant on your
behalf
like we were all in this one together
I'm arrogant you're arrogant let's go be
arrogant about Joy Reed
by the way Joyride is a very uh High
intellect person
just
you know if I'm being honest
now I think that she plays a part in
which she's you know does everything she
can to support a team
but
uh I don't think she has low
intelligence
I think she actually has above average
intelligence well above average adults
right
yeah you could not like her for other
reasons but you can't like her for lack
of intelligence but when I make fun of
her for the um
for the inflation thing
I don't believe for a second that she
believes what she's saying
so it doesn't come off as dumb to me it
just comes off as thinking you're dumb
all right uh did I miss any stories
any big stories I missed
um about Lee zeldin's persuasion
um well Lee zeldin is over performing is
he not
so I don't know exactly why you're
asking about his persuasion but my
understanding is he's just crushing it
um my understanding is he's just hitting
every note is that true is anybody
watching him to know if is he really
hitting all the notes it looks like he
is
um
how will the lockdown kids vote when
they come of age same as her parents
um yeah smart doesn't have to equate too
kind or good that's right
I'm still off blood pressure meds
completely
and yes I am checking my blood pressure
every day
um
so that because apparently there's like
uh some kind of bounce back risk so a
week after you get off a blood pressure
meds
there's some predictable
bounce so I'm watching for that it
hasn't happened yet but I'm watching for
it
um
that's the steroids what is it
Tiffany across got fired who is Tiffany
cross
Tiffany cross is who
MSNBC
did she do something a weekend host
okay
all right let's use the weekend host
or was all right did I miss anything I
think we hit everything right got it all
how many of you are actually going to
vote or how many are voting this year I
won't say on Tuesday how many how many
of you are voters
yes or no are you voters this year yes
or no
a lot of yeses
wow that's all yeses on that platform on
locals it's all yeses
if if it's an I think the no's are
probably embarrassed
probably people don't want to say no
but it could be that you know I'm
attract I'm attracting listeners who
care about politics that makes sense I
can see oh you're Canadian okay
you don't want to be Scott and not vote
that's a good reason don't be like me
yeah there are so many ways in which you
should not be like me
it's a pretty long list
all right
um somebody says not embarrassed it's a
waste of time
a micro lesson on talking to teens about
Tick Tock you would like a micro lesson
in which I teach a teen not to use the
most addictive
uh thing which has ever been created
Tick Tock there's nothing you can do
about that if you want Tick-Tock to go
away you've got to work on Banning it
then nothing will keep it away from kids
otherwise
oh what Tim Poole has a number one
music video
so I'm hearing that Tim pool has an
iTunes on iTunes you could buy a music
video for 69 cents and it's number one
on iTune Charts
oh is it
does he have is he Musical
does he actually perform it
he has a band oh I didn't know that Tim
pool has a band I wonder if they need a
drummer I wonder if they need a really
bad drummer huh
and it's funny
oh okay
all right well uh go out and buy that 69
Cent
thing
why don't you wear a beanie
well then people would think I'm Tim
Poole
that's why
all right all right I think we've done
it all have we done it all
you know we we saved Brittany I think
we're gonna have to save yay
from himself and from his personal
trainer
but uh
we're good for today I think we've
from Offspring please oh the drummer
from Offspring plays with him damn it
they have a drummer
foreign
I'm trying to learn uh Nirvana song I'd
love to I'd love to get Dave Grohl
to join me for a man cave
yeah what do you what do you think of my
odds on getting that done
so Dave Dave Grohl
um you know arguably you know the best
living Rock drummer because a number of
greats have passed away recently
um
zero chance
oh
well I think I could get Dave Grohl to
give me a drum lesson in my man cave
so I I have an idea for how I'd like to
do the man cave but I don't have the
cloud to do it and the idea goes like
this
that every time I do the man cave which
I do from my man cave
um that it would look like it's just
going to be me
and then there would be a surprise guest
who's just in the man cave just hanging
out and there's no explanation for it
it's like one day I'll just be in the
man cave and you know like the most
famous musician in the world just
happens to be hanging out it would just
be sort of a running gag that that that
interesting people just stopped by the
man cave
that's Bill Maher's gig
is that what his show does
he has he has one interesting person but
he doesn't do
the they just happen to be there so this
just happened to be their part that's
interesting
but I don't have the clout that he has
so he can get he can get people like
that to show up
who's the most famous person you think I
could get to join me on a live stream
who do you think who's the most famous
person you think I could join me on live
stream
Trump
uh Jordan Peterson
Trump Elon Musk
and tubing Jake Dapper Snoop
I couldn't get a snoop or Elton John
Joe Rogan's got his own show
guffeld could probably get duffel for
reciprocal reasons
all right well
I'll uh I'll make you a commitment
if Trump gets nominated
and runs I will invite him
on here
I think he'll say yes
because the thing is that
wherever somebody like Trump appears the
audience will be big because social
media would boost it so I don't think it
would make any difference
Rob Reiner would be terrific
how much would you like to see me
interview Rob Ryder
that would be amazing because here's
what I here's what I would do I would
treat his opinions with respect
I wouldn't invite somebody to be on my
live stream and not treat the opinion
with respect on social media you know
everybody's a jerk including me but in
person
you know I I would never invite you
somebody to show up and not give them a
full platform to do their thing
he'd be fun
because Rob Reiner is
presumably
you know smart talented funny
interesting person who just has
different politics than some of you
so he'd probably be fun if he would do
it
Kathy Griffin
now I don't think Kathy Griffin would do
it necessarily but I do have some
history with her
she was the voice of my Alice character
when Dilbert was a was animated
so I've had some contacts with her a few
times and
I like her
and I I think she knows that so maybe I
could get her but I think she would be
justifiably concerned about what my
audience would do to her
my audience would be in control
Netanyahu now that would be interesting
I don't think I could get Netanyahu
I don't think I could do that
what about Putin
do you think I could get Putin
and the other thing I wonder is would it
even be legal
is it would it be legal for me to
interview Putin
because it shouldn't be
I think it is legal but it shouldn't be
do you know why it shouldn't be
because we're at war with them
and I'd be giving him a platform
I mean I think it is it is legal as far
as I know but
probably shouldn't be
probably shouldn't be
Kim Jong-un that would be amazing
yeah the language or Pastor Nick oh my
God he would never do it
you think Pastor Nick would say yes no
he'd never do Madonna she would never do
it but
all right well you got some good ideas
all right thanks for all your
suggestions and uh thank you I'm
refreshingly arrogant
I accept that
I believe I'm refreshingly arrogant
almost like mint
sort of like a palette cleanser sort of
thing refreshingly arrogant I think I'm
going to add that to my uh my Twitter
bio
you know black lives matter Ukraine
and then that
refreshingly
arrogant all right bye for now
