all right before we start
youtubers can you tell me if you can
hear me
i'm trying something new with my audio
which is a splitter that's
charging my ipad at the same time it's
producing audio
so i think it's working i don't see any
complaints
now if you would like to enjoy this
and i know you would and i'm talking
about really enjoy it
not just the usual delight that you
always get
but i'm talking about taking it up a
level well all you need is a copper
micro glass tanker challenges dina
canteen jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing makes
what everything better yeah everything
and it's called the simultaneous hip and
it's going to happen right now
go
that's good stuff good stuff
oh i can feel every particle in my body
every molecule
every corp muscle is feeling a little
bit better
well do we have stories today
oh man oh man things are getting good
you can you can feel the 2022 election
getting closer
it's almost like a tangible thing now
but let's talk about the good news first
elon musk's
starlink which is the network of low
earth satellites launched by musk's
company
spacex i think um people are using it
already i'm not sure if it's in still in
beta or if it's
in production mode but rural people are
signing on and getting tremendous
internet speeds
so you're going to have an entirely new
way to get internet
i think everywhere everywhere in the
world
and what does it mean to the world
if everybody could get internet
connectivity
from elon musk does it mean for example
that china won't be able to block the
internet
right how do you block how would china
block
elon musk's satellites
like how would you do that could he even
do it
and so this is my big question yeah or
cuba or
anyplace else here's my big question did
elon musk just
fix everything
did he because can't you easily imagine
that the solution to everything is
better communication
if people actually knew what was
happening and were not censored
doesn't everything work better you get
more democracy dictators fall
markets are more efficient am i wrong
it looks like elon musk is this close
to fixing everything
just everything because that's all it
would take
if you think about it if everybody could
talk
to everybody without the government or
anybody interfering or getting cancelled
or
you know being kicked off the platform
or whatever else
doesn't it fix everything you know not
right away
but in the long run you know the good
forces it seems like would rise
and the bad forces would have trouble if
they couldn't control communication
so it's one of these things that just
feels like a little business story over
on the sides like oh we got another
looks like we have another way to get
internet for many other ways here's
another one
i'm not sure that's the case this might
be everything
and it's just like one of elon musk's
other businesses
it might just change everything
dr nicole sapphire points out in a tweet
that the u.s now has more people dying
from drug overdoses
every day than from covet 19.
so it's about time to re-think our
priorities
when you're in the middle of a pandemic
it's all about the pandemic
and it should be but it's time to start
thinking
about our other priorities and it's time
time to get serious about
china as the source of much but not all
of these
uh deaths and i'll say again we should
we should stop we just close our
embassies
with china we should just uh withdraw
our diplomats and close diplomatic
relations with china
until they stop sending fentanyl that
should be the opening bid
for relations just no relations
if you can't stop sending us
poison
that's it we'll just be done with you
now i would think
that if china looked at its total
strategic
situation it might say well we did like
killing you by the tens of thousands
every year
but all things considered maybe we'll
stop doing that because we also need
relations with the biggest country in
the world
i think trump could have pulled this off
he didn't and i criticized him greatly
for
failing on the fentanyl front but at
least he took a run at it
at least he tried but i mean he failed
completely nothing stopped
i'd like to see him take another run at
it frankly
is anybody watching the story with
tucker carlson
anybody so
here's what's happening there's sort of
a big picture and a little picture
the little picture which could later be
a big picture
is that tucker is talking about the
election irregularities
um now that's the small picture here's
the bigger picture
in the last several years the left has
been
one by one picking off voices on the
right
now many of those voices have
self-cancelled done things which
got their asses cancelled but
you've got uh rush limbaugh passed away
you've got for whatever reason we don't
talk about hannity as much
i'm not sure what changed there but it
seems to me yeah bill o'reilly's off
off of fox news et cetera for all for
different reasons
but correct me if i'm wrong tucker
carlson is now the most
important voice on the right who would
disagree with that
any disagreement it looks to me that
tucker carlson is the only one who takes
on the hard stories
um while also being you know
uh in prime time and having a huge
audience and being respected etc
yeah you know greg gotfeld's more of a
special case because you know he's half
entertainment half news
so he's sort of a hybrid you wouldn't
compare him to the the
hannities or the the tucker carlson's
sort of a different game but
in terms of who moves the needle it's
tucker right
sorry i think everybody i'm seeing in
the comments everybody agreeing with
that statement so whether you like
tucker or not
i think you'd agree that he's the most
important voice on the right now some of
that is from his own good work
maybe most of it is from his own good
work
but it's also true that the other voices
have been trimmed away
wouldn't you say and so his voice rose
by simply surviving
and also being excellent at what he does
so um
so here's so here's the thing tucker
carlson is talking about uh
fulton county in georgia and apparently
there's some
information that he's reporting you know
i i don't have any independent
information about that
let me pause again
to talk to youtube those of you on
locals
if you don't mind i've got a little
message for the people
on on youtube
stop complaining about the volume the
problems on your end
youtube has low volume for some people
on some videos and has nothing to do
with
the setup as you can see in the comments
the sound is fine many many people
are telling you the sound is fine so if
you want to talk about the sound
just go go go somewhere else
okay just go somewhere else anyway
tucker's
talking about some new information that
says the votes in fulton county and
georgia in 2020
so here are some of the things that come
out of that reporting
so there are a number of votes that were
counted more than once
and the evidence for that seems solid
right so these are things we seem to
know with pretty high certainty
there's some number of votes a
significant number
not necessarily enough to change the
result but a significant number
were um counted more than once
and if you've seen the you know the
evidence of it they can show them they
can show their account more than once
you can see the picture of it
you can tell very easily it's the same
ballot and you can see that it was
counted more than once
very clear but we don't know the total
number of them yet
um more than a hundred thousand ballot
tally sheets were missing for months
after the election and then when they
showed up
uh a number of them were fraudulent
meaning that the tally on the outside
didn't match or even close
to the actual account of the the bag or
whatever it was in
so we know that that happened and it
happened several times
that can be confirmed so now we know
that tallies
the vote tallies were fraudulently
changed
and we know that some significant number
of votes were counted twice
on top of that tucker was reporting that
there were piles of ballots with no
no folds in them i'm not sure how
accurate this part is but since
everything would have to be folded to be
mailed
anything that didn't have a fold on it
and apparently it looked like it was
machine reproduced as opposed to filled
out by people
um that would suggest fraud if any of
that's true
of course we would need confirmation for
that
now we're also hearing
you know some some rumors that the
maricopa stuff
has also uncovered some amount
of confirmed irregularity but we don't
know if it's trivial or a lot
so we're still waiting to hear about
that so
what would be the tip off
uh let's say hypothetically let's say
hypothetically there was
uh there were big problems with the
election and i don't have evidence
that any court has produced that such a
thing is happening
right so just so i don't get canceled no
court has shown
evidence of widespread fraud are we on
the same page
no court no court
has found widespread fraud but we also
know courts are not the place to look
for it right
it's also true that your lawnmower
has never launched a rocket into space
it's also true that
no baloney sandwich has ever
filed a patent um
but it's true that the courts did not
find any widespread fraud
and also no bologna sandwich has ever
filed a patent
those two things are true and so
i think that means something right
so here's what's interesting um
if tucker carlson is going after the big
lie
well let me back up a little bit um
i heard robert barnes on the viva viva
barnes podcast which is excellent i keep
recommending it
he said there was a tell for a lie if
somebody said
something is a thousand percent not true
that if somebody goes up to a thousand
percent it's sort of a tell
for lying and i thought about that and i
thought
i'm not sure you know it's these tells
are not 100
kinds of things right they don't always
mean what they look like they're
indicating
but i thought to myself that does sound
true-ish
you know it kind of rings true but
let me give you another example that's
sort of along those lines
the big lie the phrase
the big lie do you think that the news
needed to brand
the big lie if the only story was that
it wasn't true
why is it that this story got a brand
the big lie whereas other stories
i don't know if they get branded do they
we just call them fake news or not fake
news
we just say it's true or it's not true
but
but this got branded and all the big
media
entities use the brand does that sound
like something that a news person came
up with on their own
do you think somebody in the news
business said hey
let's let's let's call it the big lie
do you think so yeah and of course the
purpose of it is that it's a hitler
analogy
so it makes anybody in the trump
organization look like
a hitler-like entity because the big lie
comes directly from nazi propaganda
but do you think the you've been
watching the news people forever
do you think that the news people are
clever enough
to pull off that kind of a persuasion
move to to call it the big lie and make
it stick
because it's sticking really well do you
think so
because i don't see evidence of that
skill set
in the media itself
where that skill set be if if it's not
the news
people who are trained to come up with
propaganda of that
quality because that's really high
quality propaganda
who's uh who's got those kinds of skills
well i do i have those kinds of skills
but it wasn't me
who else yeah it's the cia
right is somebody associated with
or trained by an intelligence agency
when you see the big lie that's like a
thousand percent
it's this glaring signal that they're
covering up fraud
that doesn't mean they are one one
possibility is that there's somebody in
the news organization
who is really good at branding and maybe
just wanted to brand this thing maybe it
was cnn
maybe it was jeff sucker it's possible
you know you could get lucky right it's
possible that somebody could hit on you
know
the just the right thing that's stuck in
people's minds and people like that they
just copied it
because things go viral all the time and
not necessarily from
experts who created a viral thing but
if you wanted to look at what it
obviously looks like
which is not what it necessarily is
right so let's say that sometimes things
look obviously like something but that
doesn't mean it is that right
we could be fooled but let me tell you
what it looks
obviously like and now that we know that
there is
a significant fraud in the election
we don't know if it's enough to change
the election but it's significant enough
that you would at least change your
rules and procedures to deal with it
would we agree with that standard could
we say at
this point with what's already been
reported
does it feel safe to say that we're not
yet at a point where you'd say the
election should be changed because of
anything that's been reported
but you would definitely say that you
should
change your procedures for voting
because it uncovered a number of
problems that if they had been larger
could have changed the outcome so i
would say that the definition of
significant voter fraud would be
something that causes you to change the
process
have we reached that level don't you
think we've reached the level where
you'd
if anything that if anything that tucker
reported is true any of it
you'd have to change the process to make
sure it doesn't happen again
right i call that significant
so in the in the context of a
reasonably high confidence that there's
significant fraud far short perhaps of
changing an outcome but
still significant and you have
a um a propaganda let's say
event um maybe that's just speculation
but you've got this big lie thing that
looks like it comes from professionals
because honestly i've never seen anybody
in the news business who had that kind
of skill
but everybody not everybody but the cia
would have that skill
so it looks like and i'm not claiming
this is true
because i get cancelled for claiming
anything like that
but if you were just going to say well
what's it look like
it looks like a stolen election
supported by the intelligence agencies
of
the united states and then
sold to the american people through the
the media to suppress any questions by
calling it the big lie
and making sure that if you questioned
it you would be labeled
a nazi right now if you were thinking
scott scott scott i don't think this is
some big conspiracy
because if there was some big conspiracy
you'd see all kinds of signs of it for
example
on the very day that tucker carlson
reported on these irregularities
alleged alleged irregularities
if it were really a organized effort by
um powerful people behind the scenes
you would think that just about the same
day that tucker did that
there would be a major movement to
cancel tucker
oh oh wait there is today
today the hashtag tucker is killing us
is matched with a video compilation in
which there are
claims that tucker's made about i don't
know the vaccine
dangers or something and so they put
together a clip
that shows that he is his advice would
get you killed
you know if you if you followed his i
guess you could call it
you know medical reporting or something
that
you could get yourself killed so do you
think it's a coincidence
that uh there's a full-on attack on
tucker carlson
at the same time that he's breaking the
story at the same time that he's the
most important voice on the right
does that sound like a coincidence how
about the fact
that if any of this reporting about the
election is true
even if it doesn't rise to the level of
it would have changed the election
but if it's true and if it's true to the
level of being significant
meaning that rules would have to change
to make it stop next time
trump's your next president
right try to think of a situation in
which we could know for sure
that the election had been fraudulent in
a bunch of ways
even maybe way less than enough to
change the outcome
but say we confirmed it was fraudulent
in a number of ways
trump's your next president
what the hell are you going to do about
it i'm not saying it's good or bad
i'm saying if tucker's reporting holds
up
trump's your next president
because it will be too delicious
to keep him out of office
because trump term one
is a dangerous
trump term two
is a dangerous on steroids
and when i say dangerous i mean to the
system not to the country
what would he do if he didn't need to
get reelected
now i'm not worried about you know the
the propaganda that he wants to
take over the country etc i'm not
worried about that at all
but i don't think republicans would be
able to resist
letting a rabid dog into the house with
their enemies
i feel like if the pit bull wants to
kill somebody
and you need somebody killed
figuratively speaking not not
actually killing people
i feel like it's going to be too hard to
resist
because you know people don't really
make decisions on policies and stuff
like that
they make decisions based on how they
feel
how would you feel if you
believed that the election was
fraudulent and even if it didn't change
the final outcome
they tried really hard how do you feel
that'll get you to the election won't it
and what if they
fix these holes for next time
um yeah yeah the figuratively speaking
part might not make it into the quote
i see somebody saying that trump wasn't
really vaccinated
i i'm positive he was really vaccinated
i don't think that story i don't think
we'd miss that story
but i'm positive he's really vaccinated
all right so
we've got some interesting stuff going
here if i would say
if tucker does not get cancelled
um republicans will sweep 2022
and then 2024 is going to be pretty much
whatever they want
getting a lot of calls early in the
morning it's weird
all right um
in related news and it's probably not a
coincidence
there's uh some reporting from the
guardian
uh now the guardian is a british
publication
are the are the brits um
on the same side as the united states
they're our allies right
but have you ever noticed that britain
seems to be
prominently involved in some stories
that we don't like
such as the steel steel dossier
right so i'm not entirely sure
that great britain is always our friend
because you know your friends sometimes
want to influence you
for their own self-interest so it could
be that
great britain is not exactly as much a
friend to the united states as they
could be
i'll just put that out there but now we
have the guardian a
british publication saying that somehow
they have these
uh they they got a hold of secret
kremlin
secret kremlin papers
that seemed to show a plot by putin
himself
directly involved to
make sure that a mentally unstable
candidate
who they thought was trump allegedly
would get elected and that they were
going to put all of their
efforts in russia all of their assets
were going to be
put into getting trump elected
now have you ever heard more in
your life
oh and there's also there's also a
suggestion
that there's really compromising
material that russia really does have
that they just didn't use the first term
i guess
but secret stuff they have but it's in
the appendix which
is not included that's convenient right
the accusations of the compromising
information
it's referred to in the appendix but
they don't have that
they got the document but not the
appendix
totally believable all right
this is just a repeat of 2016 right all
the other doing is they're just running
the same games again because they
they worked last time
do you think that putin would want a
quote mentally unstable president of the
united states to be his
opponent do you believe that
because putin thought that that trump
would
cause more civil strife that he wanted
trump to be his opponent
a mentally unstable guy with the nuclear
codes
pointed at russia that's what he wanted
you think potent is that stupid
there's no indication that that trump
that putin is that dumb
none in fact
in fact if anything putin is so
rational it just drives you crazy
he's very rational he does you know even
if he's evil
which apparently he is he's very
rational
so i can't imagine that he'd want a
mentally unstable
person to be his opponent that doesn't
seem like a good play
so i'm going to say that this looks like
a british intelligence operation
just it's just a speculation right i
don't have proof of any any of that
but to me it looks like a british
intelligence operation
to keep trump out of the white house
that's what it looks like to me
um likewise the um
well that's what it looks like then
we've got this story
um that apparently
uh the chiefess the chief of staff of
the military
general milley was so afraid
that trump would try to do a a coup
but he said damn it that coup will never
happen
because the military has all the guns
and the coup plotters don't have enough
guns to take over the country
to which i say how did we get
as the chief of staff of the military of
the strongest
military power in the history of
civilization
how did we end up with the dumbest
 general in the world
because i've seen him talk now and the
whole time he's talking i think
is it my imagination or is he really a
dumb
and he's really dumb like actually just
literally dumb
and i don't say that about most people
that i criticize
have you ever heard me call like you
know major political people that i
disagree with
dumb i don't really use that word a lot
because i usually think that by the time
you reach that level
you're pretty damn smart even if you're
evil and even
even if i don't agree with what you're
doing i still say you're pretty damn
smart
but he looks actually dumb and when he
when i saw him testifying
he didn't sound smart at all and i i do
believe that you can tell
i do believe that you can tell the
difference
um between somebody who's dumb and smart
if you just listen to him talk
and he feels dumb and i don't feel safe
with that guy in the uniform at all
so that's a problem
so do you think that there was ever a
real risk
of a coup just because the dumbest guy
in uniform
was afraid of one even at the same time
he realized that a guy in a viking hat
could not conquer the military of the
united states
he still thought there was a risk
really now certainly there was a risk of
violence
and violence happened but that's not a
risk of a coup
how do a bunch of unarmed protesters you
know with what
some uh blunt objects and some bear
spray or something
how did the chief of our military think
that that was going to be somehow
yeah the zip ties how did how did the
head of our military think that that was
going to be a coup
he acted as if he was the one who knew
it wouldn't work
do you know who else knew that that
wouldn't work
everybody everybody including the people
involved
there was nobody who thought that that
was a coup it's
just purely the intelligence agencies
manipulating the media
to tell you as a coup it's crazy
uh trump teed up the problem by calling
for supporters
yeah yeah i'm not the one to say trump
is
is blame free in case you're wondering
did trump do everything he could have
done to stop
uh scott's lying
hey dick what are the odds that my
critics are always named richard
they're literally dicks so richard
may i call you dick uh
you are queuing me up perfectly for my
next topic thank you
have you noticed a trend which is that
my critics
have completely stopped criticizing my
content
they only go after me personally now and
they say things like
your your take on vaccinations was a hot
mess
what part what would be a thing i said
that you disagree with just name one
thing
but now i'm lying but we're not going to
specify what you're lying about
that's not important no you're just
you're just lying
about what oh you're just lying
and you know
you know that i've that something is
working in what i'm saying
because if if there were specific things
people disagreed with they would just
say it
they would say you said x here's my data
to show you're wrong
or you said x was true and my opinion is
wrong and here's why
how hard would that be even in a tweet
you could fit all that in
but no nope
i'm going to move my microphone down a
little bit because somebody that i'm
getting a lot of uh
a lot of people talking on uh youtube
to turn up my sound and one has asked me
to move my microphone up so i'm gonna
move it down a little bit
 you all right i'm going to move it
down a little bit
so every time you tell me to move it
move the volume up i'm going to move it
down a little bit
okay just go to locals if you want to
hear the
the the volume you'll have to subscribe
but um
all right um somebody says china's doing
it
all right let's talk about uh
let's talk about the teachers unions uh
there's a good
a good uh tweet here by adam dopamine
who said that juneteenth first
celebrated in 1865 but the public was
ignorant to its existence until last
year well i think the white public was
ignorant to his existence i think the
black public kind of knew what it was
but the point still stands that the
teachers unions failed to educate us
about racially important events
clearly they can't be trusted to teach
critical race theory
and i thought it's a pretty good point
the teachers who never told us or at
least
most of us about something called
juneteenth
how are they going to teach you critical
race theory you went all your life
without hearing about that
or at least many of you did all right um
cerno was right about the fbi lying
i don't know about that story exactly
just looking at your uh
at your comments now all right um
that's all i've got for now and i'm
going to go do some other things
but keep watching for
indications that the intelligence
agencies are running
everything because at this point the
signals seem to indicate that pretty
clearly
and i wouldn't say there's proof
but certainly all the the evidence is
just
sort of now really clear
it might be false but it sure looks that
way
all right um
yeah all right i'm just looking at your
comments
i'm gonna turn off youtube and i will
talk to you youtubers tomorrow
