see if anybody finds me over there so
the Abraham Accords are one year old and
here's the big news
they worked
the uh the Abraham Accords work so it's
a year later and everybody's happy
is what that's one of the uh most
amazing things
when do things work
when was the last time somebody
something actually worked just the way
you wanted it to work
isn't that weird so this is a gigantic
Trump accomplishment uh Avi Berkowitz
and Eric Kushner got nominated for you
know Nobel Peace Prize for this and they
work
you lots of times somebody will get
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and
then a year later it's just everything
fell apart but here's a case where they
got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize
and it worked like every part of this
work it's going great they're doing
trade travel
so
um that's just a huge thing for the
Trump Administration
so uh Mike Lindell is doing his cyber
Symposium and it's not going well it's
not going well so I guess the point of
the Cyber Symposium was to show us all
all these strong evidence of voter fraud
which turned into no evidence of voter
fraud whatsoever at least
um
yeah my microphone's unplugged we'll see
if this makes a difference on
see if that makes a difference on
YouTube
um
YouTube stopped
are you serious
that the
uh locals is back
all right sounds okay
good Lord can you believe that live
streaming is such a big deal
and
and at the same time
nobody can do it
the technology for live streaming on two
platforms just really doesn't exist I
mean I'm trying to bang it together on
my own with you know trial and error
every component and you can't really
make any of it work
consistently it's it's all really hinky
all right
um
I think locals is back on audio right
um somebody on locals tell me you can
you can hear
no audio still on locals I don't believe
that
really
um no audio here Jesus
um do you mind over on uh
on YouTube you still have audio
same here no audio
really
really is it true that I don't
have audio on either platform right now
I'm using two completely separate
systems and nobody can hear me
audio
let's see no audio no audio
good Lord
I can't believe it all right
let's try it again
I'll tell you
um the the fact that this technology
I've simplified it to the ultimate of
Simplicity it's just a iPad now with a
microphone and even that doesn't work
there's just like nothing you
can do
all right well I'll just finish up on
YouTube here
um
and so the Cyber Symposium isn't going
too well
uh Mike Lindell tried to show his his
evidence but there was a CNN expert
there who said I didn't see any
he he didn't say the evidence was wrong
um
he just said he didn't see any
so we've gotten to this point
where Mike Lindell has done all this
work and at least according to CNN they
didn't agree or disagree with his
evidence they didn't see any
um
all right
I was suggesting today that we need
something like a supreme court for fact
checking and of course as soon as I said
that then all of the
well I won't insult people but there's a
certain type of thinking
uh was it uh
who called this synaptogrid Eric
Weinstein snapped to grid thinking where
if you give anybody any Nuance about
anything they can't handle the Nuance so
they have to snap it to the closest grid
that's something they do understand
so I think I'm not sure if he uses it in
the same context but I like that analogy
um
so a lot of people said wait a supreme
court for fact checking you mean like
the ministry of Truth
Scott you mean like the ministry of
truth that's really what you're
recommending
to which I say no that's what we have
now
the the ministry of Truth is the current
situation
where the the powers that be tell you
what's true
and your side says oh yeah I guess
that's true and then the other side says
it's not true so we have the ministry of
truth but there are two of them there's
one for the left and one for the right
so it's the opposite of anything useful
so imagine if you will a supreme court
for fact checking something that we
wouldn't have needed in the past and so
the founders would never would have
imagined that they needed a special
department for it but imagine if you had
facts that were presented
by let's say the media or even the
public and they could they could just
submit stuff for fact checking
and imagine if you will that the process
for arguing the facts was public
so you'd see the the people on both
sides arguing their facts you would see
the members of the fact-checking Supreme
Court ask them questions and then when
it was done they would issue a ruling
and there would be a Minority Report
The Minority Report is really important
and certainly we don't have anything
like that wouldn't you like to see seven
justices say well we looked at the data
and we're let's say we're trained
economists or we're trained in
statistics or whatever and seven out of
nine of us say yes this is true
but you should know that two out of nine
of us weren't so sure and here are their
reasons
wouldn't that be way better
than nobody trying to figure out what's
true or partisan's figment was true now
imagine too that you had life
appointments which is one of the things
that makes the Supreme Court work life
appointments so nobody has to answer to
anybody and you make it a high-paying
job prestigious so that people don't
need to take bribes
so whatever it is that makes the Supreme
Court work
we could borrow a lot of that to make
some kind of a not Ministry of truth but
a supreme court for facts
and don't reject it out of hand just
because you can't think of the exact way
to do that
just think that everything that's wrong
right now
is because we don't have this
let me say that again everything that's
wrong with the country is because we
don't have a supreme court for fact
checking We can't agree what to do
now some of the some of the things we
can't agree on our strategy and nobody
really knows the future so you can't
tell if strategy is a good idea usually
but
facts we ought to be working on the same
set of facts so let's fix that it's
fixable you just need a better system
birth rate is following falling since
2007 and I guess a big part of the
problem is that children or parents
don't want all the responsibility in all
the work
here is another case where we have
drifted into a world that doesn't work
at all and we should just tear it down
and start over
the the average way that parents raise
kids in the United States
is so messed up
it's not good for the kids it's
definitely not good for the parents it's
just sort of what we do let me give you
an example
uh I might spend two hours a day driving
kids to school
two hours because uh everybody drives
out here and there's gigantic lines you
got to go early you know it's across
town
uh you know there's just all kinds of
complications to it that's just every
day
now that's all just completely wasted
time completely wasted time because
you should build a town where kids can
walk to school
when I grew up we just walked to school
it wasn't close I mean not that close
but it was close enough
well imagine building a town where there
are bicycle paths and it's safe and
lighted and they're say video cameras
and any kid even the young ones can just
leave the house with their little lunch
box and walk on the path and just walk
to school to be big kids there and you
know everything would be safe enough
so you can imagine like a hundred
different ways the classes would be
better they would teach better things
they could get back and forth easily
there wouldn't be all that paperwork you
wouldn't have these after school
activities that don't really help
anybody
uh you there's just a million things you
could redesign so we've actually got our
systems for raising children so here's
the the major point
the system for raising children is so
bad
that women won't do it
it's just too inconvenient and I
actually agree with them if I look at
what it takes to raise a kid today
versus what it took you know when I was
a kid they're completely different
and we were raised almost like you know
like feral you know
free-range chickens you know we'd leave
you know at a fairly young age
we were allowed to leave the house let's
say the summer in the summer you could
leave the house on your bike and your
only requirement was to be home for
dinner five o'clock that's it that's the
that's the next time your parents would
see you is when you sat down at the
dinner table now
I'm not saying that's a good or bad
system but I'm saying that our system
for raising children is completely
broken and if we don't fix it our birth
rate is just going to fall through the
floor
because having a child having a child
today is just really not a good deal
compared to what it was
um here's a provocative statement I made
that uh
the the least credible thing you can see
on the internet is the Rogue Doctor Who
disagrees with all the other doctors
now this could be a tough conversation
here I know
the Rogue Doctor Who disagrees with all
the other doctors and there's a viral
video now you're thinking of specific
ones in your head right now right it's
not about a specific one
it's about the category
because part of your risk management
decision is to look at the category so
let me give you an example somebody
tells you that they have figured out how
to make nuclear uh
Fusion work in their garage
with components that that they bought at
the hardware store
now that's a category of claim
that's always untrue
so you don't need to look at the details
I mean you should probably you know
maybe you should look into them a little
bit but you don't need to
to know if it's probably not true right
there's some things that are in that
just category of probably not true
and the the Rogue doctor who sees what
nobody else can see only I have seen the
truth and all the other experts in my
field have not seen the truth and let me
tell you I've treated 15 people and so I
know what the randomized controlled
trials do not know because of my 15
anecdotal examples
all right now
um yeah forget about the fact that I
call them Rogue let's say they're the
the ones disagreeing with the mainstream
whatever you want to call that
uh in my experience
I can't think of a single time
that the lone doctor with the viral
video has been right in the end can you
now I know you can think some of some
examples from all of history
so for example you'll say well for every
big change there was somebody who got
there first
so yeah for everything that we didn't
have right in the past but now we do
there was a rogue doctor Somebody went
first
but how about the last 10 years
in the last 10 years
how many videos have there been of the
Rogue Doctor Who was the only one who
sees everything the way it is how many
of them turned out to be right
you know once enough time had gone by
that we know if they're right or wrong
none
none right the so the odds of the Rogue
doctor being right are
close to zero they're not zero though
they're not zero so the trouble is that
they're very convincing
very convincing and somebody says Rand
Paul uh
that's a special case I I Rand Paul's a
politician who also is a doctor I don't
know if I would count that one that's
sort of a special case
so anyway um I would just say this if
you believe that that doctor you saw in
the video whichever doctor it was and
whichever video it was if you believe
them when they're disagreeing with all
the other experts
they could be true
it could be true
but I'd say the odds of it are under 10
percent
let's just say does anybody disagree
with that by the way does any disability
disagree with the sort of General notion
that nine out of 10 of these doctors who
have the secret and nobody else has it
not even a ten are
right
so to keep that in mind
uh here's a interesting thing that
happened on the internet today there was
a Ken kalanian who works for NBC News
he tweeted that at least 125 000 fully
vaccinated Americans have tested
positive for a covid
125 000 fully vaccinated Americans still
got coveted so what would that lead you
to disagree to imagine
about the vaccinations I was sort of
suggest they don't work that well
doesn't it
now here's Fox News
they reported that of vaccinated people
uh the total number of vaccinated people
who died were .001 of the total
that's called context good context how
about hospitalizations .003 percent of
all the hospitalizations for covet were
a vaccinated people
now that's data
so and and the comments were fascinating
because anytime Fox News is is on social
media especially Twitter uh the all the
anti-fox news people will come in and
say Fox News is wrong about everything
except this time that didn't happen
this time the critics of Fox News and
the comments said uh oh
did Fox News just get this right with
the accurate context and NBC News is
misleading us even the people who don't
like Fox News said oh this is right they
got this right
so uh of course I don't I can't speak to
the accuracy of any data but the way Fox
News reported it was exactly the way the
public wants to see this
right we do also need to know that 125
000 vaccinated people got uh coveted so
that's a big part of the story but if
they're not dying
that's the bigger part of the story so
the other day I was saying that this is
exactly how the news should report it
they should tell us the deaths and
hospitalizations
and Fox News got it right
now I'm not saying that I had anything
to do with that I'm just saying that
um they got it right now I've told you
this before
this is sort of a big deal
um you can argue all a day about CNN and
MSNBC and Fox News and you know which
one's the bad one
but Fox News is continuously better
produced
you can talk about the on-air Talent all
day long who you like who you don't you
do or you don't like Tucker Carlson
whatever but the just the quality of the
uh back route well we do call them the
support staff The Producers uh every
part of the design of Fox News is really
well done like substantially better done
than their competition
so if any uh Fox News producers are
watching you guys kill it all the time I
mean just consistently you're just
killing it and I'm not sure if the
public can tell
how much of the equality of your work
you know makes it up on the screen
because you know the on-air Talent tends
to get the credit
that was my
news of the day
somebody says Fox News is right wing
propaganda
well unfortunately we have a news
business that does cater to its
individual audiences so it can it can
turn into that yes
let's see what's to say
[Music]
um
I think they care well okay
I'm just looking at some of your
comments here for a minute
Scott appear on gotfield's got fell Joe
please uh I will do that
um I took several months off from
appearing on other media because I just
needed to get some other stuff done
um
let's see
proof that Dominion election machines in
Detroit had Wi-Fi connections go to this
page nope nope I'm not going to go to
that page because I don't believe that
there is I don't believe it's true I
don't believe that the evidence exists
so I I do not believe that we have
proofs that Dominion machines were
connected to the internet
I do believe you could prove that it's
technically possible
but proving that they were connected
during the election or during any other
time before or after
ah
so the question about whether the
vaccinations themselves are causing the
variance
I don't really understand that argument
um
don't understand it at all
because
wouldn't you get just as many variants
with or without the vaccination
if the vaccinations somebody do me a
fact check on this all right I'll give
you my dumb guy not a doctor not an
expert
um thinking through it
let's say you've got a you've got a big
population and variants happen on their
own right so the vaccination doesn't
trigger the variant
is just one part of the filtering system
that some people imagine allows more
variants to break through
but
um
so viruses mutate
but don't they view mutate exactly the
same whether you're vaccinated or not
why would it change you remember the
even the vaccinated people get the virus
so in theory the vaccination shouldn't
make
like I don't see the mechanism that
would cause a vaccination to increase
the number of variants because the
number of variants
I just don't see it seems like it would
decrease it
like my common sense says if the if the
vaccination causes fewer humans to have
bad outcomes it will cause them to
spread it less
this should be less variance right just
because there's less virus
I would think that the only thing that
causes variance is the total amount of
virus
and if the vaccination reduces the
number of humans who have a virus
doesn't that reduce the variance
I I guess somebody needs to explain them
better
um let's see if there's somebody who
knows this
on the comments
so it says the vax filters out only
leaving the variants well
but those variants would be there anyway
right so here's the mechanism so the
mechanism that is suggested that I don't
think is true so so this is just
suggested by a commenter is that let's
say the vaccination stopped all the
normal virus
but it couldn't stop a variant and the
variant would break out
but the variant was going to break out
anyway right
because if the variant exists and it
wasn't it wasn't the vaccination that
caused it right nobody says that
we're saying that the vaccine vaccine
simply allows it it doesn't cause it
so if it's simply allowing something
that happened anyway
wasn't it going to happen anyway because
it happened anyway it didn't have
anything to do with the the vaccination
the vaccination simply failed to stop it
how does failing to stop something
create more of it
it only fails to stop it and with or
without the vaccination
that would have failed to stop it too
right
so I guess we need more information on
this
uh I see Ada Ade
variance forever the virus competes yeah
I don't think any of you know how to
explain that either so I'm not saying
it's not true
I'm just saying I don't understand how
it could be true which is a little
different all right that's all I got for
now and I'll talk to you tomorrow
