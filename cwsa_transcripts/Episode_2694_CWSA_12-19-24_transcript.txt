as soon as we're ready to go
here looks like we got our comments
working looks like the live stream's
working we're in good
shape
except I need to put something in a
different place here let's see how can I
make that stand
up so do do you mind if I take a minute
to bch I I just a a quick
complaint uh Apple computer when you
made your stupid iPhone and you knew
that the main way it works is upright or
sideways but never upside down like that
doesn't work upside down why did you put
why did you put the charger in the
bottom CU then I can't set it down at
the same time I'm charging
it wouldn't it make sense to put the
charger on the top
in what world does it make sense to have
it in your way all the time and they
never thought of
that it's just mindboggling I I can't
believe that Steve Jobs would have done
this if it worked upside down it'd be
fine I just turn it upside down but they
stopped making it work upside
down so
anyway so what I'm trying to do is lay
it sideways so I can see your comments
which appears to be
are you kidding
me never get a stand that has suction
cups on
it so I'm going to
cleverly insert this into
this area so that the
taada it beat the
system haha system
all right good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's the best time you'll
ever have but if you'd like to take it
up to levels that nobody can even
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need is a CER micro glass
a tanker Chell suin a canteen Jugger
flask vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dopamine H the day thing to makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen right now go
extraordinary all kinds of things
happening I hear some airports in New
Jersey are being closed or there's some
kind of warning because of the drones so
apparently no matter what we do this
drone story doesn't go
away have any of you settled on your
your best theory about the drones we're
not going to talk about today but
there's that one bit of new
news well I think it's going to be a
combination of different things and
people who don't know things
and um a little Mass hysteria and a
little bit of Truth a little bit of
everything in
there um did I see that Harris just got
a $20 million book
deal every time an X president gets a
multi-million dollar book deal I just
assume that's IL legitim
does that feel like a
bribe I I feel like there's some kind of
backdoor deal I don't know I mean I
don't have any you know information
about it but I feel like there's always
a backdoor deal where the publisher will
come out whole no matter how many books
are sold there's something going on with
this whole publisher
situation anyway uh fonny Willis
apparently is disqualified from the uh
Trump election case
the Georgia higher Court ruled that she
had uh some kind of conflict of
interest so Trump just keeps winning
it's just non-stop
winning um Andrew hubin reminds us that
uh the research shows the clear benefit
of drinking coffee gives you more
attention focus in athletic performance
so if you enjoyed the simultaneous hip
you're probably feeling like you have
more attention more focus and you're
better as sport
I know you can feel it it just takes one
sip would you be surprised to know that
there's another breakthrough in battery
storage yes the mes University they
figured out some newly discovered
material that integrates three modes of
energy
storage which I call
trimodal um and it uses boric acid
andic Su suic acid suic Su suic acid
some kind of
acid and it's inexpensive
environmentally friendly and all that
now again the only reason I redo these
stories every single day about battery
storage is it really is
everything if we somehow could make our
battery storage you know five times
better civilization would be really
different and it looks like that's going
to happen one way or the
another there's a study according to USA
Today that women lawmakers are 70 times
more likely to be victims of deep fake
porn let's see if there was any way that
they could have saved time and money on
this study is there anything they could
have done to be certain they had the
right answer but not to spend the money
and the time to do the
study well you could have asked every
single
human
male I think every one of us would have
gotten this right let's see do I would I
rather see uh I'm not going to name
names I was going to name names but now
I realize how classless that is I was
going to say would I rather see Mitch
McConnell naked and having a threesome
or would I rather and then I stopped
myself because if I put in a
name then that becomes the news and yeah
blah blah blah but you know I mean yes
uh surprise people like to see women
more than
men the economy is kind of strong if you
don't count the debt that's going to
kill us all but the uh economy grew a
little bit better than expected um 3.1%
in the third quarter beating
expectations that were merely
2.8 I pity the people who made those
poor
projections uh consumer spending was
good in the GDP price index to up and
the core prices Rose but not much more
than expectation
2.2%
so the bottom line of course is that the
FED probably doesn't have a reason to do
too many cuts when the FED Cuts interest
rates that's what makes the stock market
go up so now that we know that the stock
Mark that the rates won't be cut as much
as we thought because the economy is
stronger
in theory the market should be down
today
right but it's not what happened was
there something that happened yesterday
that had potentially enormous Financial
impact on the United States in a
positive way did something
happen yes it
did we're going to talk about
that all
right um we get the there in a minute so
CNN uh has some
reporting last night um it's about how
how the Democrats were shielding Biden
and his declining brain from um the real
world and she said quote what we found
is that the shell around Biden was kind
of always hard but became harder and
thicker and the walls became
taller uh and that wall was that wall
was blocked from the American people and
apparently they had a habit of when they
showed Biden how he's doing they would
have to clip out all the mocking of his
gaffs can you imagine being the
president of the United
States and because the news that you see
is what your advisor put in front of you
it's not like you're sitting in front of
the TV too much can you imagine being
Biden and not being aware that he was
being mocked mercilessly for his gffs
get just try to hold that in your head
he's the president of the United
States and the entire world is laughing
at him for having his brain
degraded and he's the only one who
doesn't know he's the only one and he
and he lives in a world that's saturated
with media but because he's busy and
because they tell him the things he
needs to know he's the only one who
doesn't know do you know how much easier
it would have been to convince him to
drop out of the race if he had seen his
own bad
press if he had seen his own bad press
he would have dropped down sooner now if
CNN and
MSNBC had been more honest about how he
was doing do you think he would have
stayed in the
race if the pollsters had been doing
accurate polls do you think he would
have stayed in the
race here's here's what I think have you
noticed that the Democrats have this
habit of being the perpetrators of
whatever the Badness is and then blaming
it on somebody else well usually they're
blaming it on
Republicans but if you turn on the news
the news is going to say oh those that
Biden campaign was bad and Joe Biden was
bad because he didn't leave the race
earlier do you know what would have made
him leave the race
earlier accurate news and ACC accurate
polls you idiots you you kept
feeding your own idiots fake news and
fake polls and they believed it and so
did Biden maybe instead of blaming Biden
for staying in the race too long you
should blame yourself for
gaslighting the country which caused him
to be gaslighted at the same time so
that he legitimately thought he had a
chance of winning I don't think that
Biden would have gone so far if he knew
he had no chance of winning
it was the news that him and the
pollsters and then and then his campaign
were of course incompetent so you had
Dei fake news and fake polls that's what
took Biden down it wasn't Biden he was
the recipient of the worst help anybody
ever got because all they cared about
was Trump
trump so yeah stop stop blaming
Biden ultim he's the guy in the job so
he gets you know I understand how it
works Biden's in the job so he has to
take the you know take the hit but
honestly none of it would happen if all
of the people around him had done their
jobs none of it he would have looked at
the news same as we did and said oh that
doesn't look good there's no way I'm
going to win with this kind of news
coverage
anyway so you know um
so before we talk about that continued
resolution which of course I will uh I
am
continually entertained by how the
Democrats can't figure out what went
wrong now just as my prior example they
think Biden was the problem no it was
the news it was the polls it was his
advisers um but they get pretty much
everything
wrong because to understand it correctly
would be quite damning to their own you
know
capabilities so the way cognitive
dissonance works is if you don't want to
you don't want to accept something that
says you're stupid or that you did a bad
job so you just imagine that something
else happened that's how cognitive
distance works so you remember how they
running when Biden was running I'm sorry
when uh Harris was running against uh
Trump and Biden before that
and Biden before that
um that they were doing all these
generic complaints you know the generic
complaints were Trump's going to end
democracy and people were saying but gas
is too expensive could you talk about
that uh he's uh he's Putin's best
friend all right but like could you talk
about the price of eggs and so you would
think that the one thing that they would
most understand is that this conceptual
stuff is not hitting anybody in the
fields like they don't have anybody good
who understands persuasion on their team
apparently at the moment they have it
looks like they have nobody who
understands the basics of persuasion no
end democracy isn't touching
anybody uh so now so now that uh Trump's
elected um there's a hill opinion piece
in the publication called the hill
and the title is Trump will turn
America's justice system into a tool of
political
Revenge what's that sound like it's more
end democracy stuff they didn't learn
anything they didn't learn
anything that that talking in these
generic ways about he's going to be it's
a tool of political Revenge it just
doesn't
hit you just want to be able to pay for
your gas and your eggs and make sure
that you're not the country isn't
destroyed by invading
migrants but
uh
so makes you wonder why they uh sto
saying the their other generic thing do
you remember their other generic thing
they used to say nobody's Above the Law
and they would say it about Trump
because they were law faring him you
know all these illegitimate legal
processes illegit in my opinion and uh
they every day was like no one's Above
the Law no one's Above the
Law so now uh now that Derek Chauvin um
got he got permission to have uh George
Floyd's heart and some of his juices
tested somehow I guess there's some skin
tissue that was saved and they could
find out if he died for reasons related
to maybe a heart
condition and that would potenti get
Derek Chauvin out of jail now what would
be the problem with somebody asking for
some evidence that wasn't included in
the trial but everybody who hears the
story knows oh that would have been good
evidence to be in the trial so it's a
person who was convicted and he simply
wants to make sure that the trial did
include all the correct
evidence so what does the Biden
Department of Justice say when somebody
says can we include the real important
evidence such as the quality of his
heart at the time he died very very
obvious Simple Thing we'd all want to
know and uh the Biden Department of
Justice is deciding to try to fight it
and deny him the chance to look at the
the health of the heart the heart
muscles or whatever whatever it is they
saved now what happened to no one's
above the law
what what happened to caring about the
rule of law and the Democracy because
you know what Derek Chauvin when he when
he requested this extra evidence he did
it completely within the confines of the
legal process he didn't steal
it he he's not trying to kill somebody
to get the specimens he had legal
lawyers do legal things according to the
legal process and everybody with common
sense would say yeah you know what you
even though he was convicted he he has a
right to see that stuff he absolutely
has a right to see
it so yeah it feels like the Democrats
just want to be on whatever is the dumb
side meanwhile Harvard of course was
forced to back off from its Dei hiring
practices where it was discriminating
against asian-americans and against
white
Americans mostly and so now we can see
the result of that and their their Law
School
admissions uh the black enrollment
dropped by more than
half so is that good or
bad well Democrats of course seem to
have some trouble understanding where
the problem is the problem is definitely
not Harvard's admission process that is
not what's keeping any black person from
succeeding but definitely the quality of
their undergraduate or or their you know
their regular school definitely the
quality of their school and their income
situation um those would make a big
difference so if you think the problem
with College admission has something to
do with the college you're missing the
first 18 years of the kids's life the
first 18
years can make a big difference so no
you can't fix that after it's too late
so that's I
so while it might look like bad news I
think that's good news um in the sense
that we're getting back
to capability over
identity well you would not be surprised
to know that there was a a college in
Memphis Tennessee a little College
called uh RADS college and there was
some uh prot Trump graffiti that was
they say was racist and they did an
investigation to see who did this prot
Trump racist graffiti how do you think
that turned out take a guess if you
haven't heard the story already so there
was
graffiti from what looked like a trump
supporter and it was very racist and
then they looked into
it and it was a hoax of course it was
not a trump supporter it was a
anti-trump
person of course
of course I feel like I missed the
story I'll get to it
um so so that's a right on
model uh
MSNBC uh had a uh pundit on there she uh
she might think of herself as a young
black woman the only thing I know for
sure she's a black woman I don't know
how young she is but she said quote the
Democratic party should be led by young
women of
color so is that what the Democrats got
wrong did they lose everything because
they didn't have enough young women of
color running things now nothing against
young women of
color uh who by the way are doing great
in society if you didn't know that uh
black women are doing really well you
know relative to historical Norms but
also relative to white men uh um black
women are going to college at record
rates earning earning well after
graduation so black women are doing
great actually um so she says the
Democratic party should be led by young
women of color of course that's identity
politics and of course that's the reason
they lost so I could not be more amused
by their inability to learn from their
mistakes but here's one that's fun um
I'm told that this didn't actually
happen in the real world but there was a
post that makes it look like it happened
it's still just as fun even though it
didn't happen so there's a clip of uh
Scott
Galloway saying that he had planned this
was before the election like a day
before or something he said he planned
to bet
$358,000 on
Harris and he said the reason he thought
that was a good bet um and I was just
told in the comments earlier that he
didn't actually place the bet so the day
before the election he was talking like
this is very serious and he was placing
the bet but somebody says he didn't
place it but his argument went like this
that the what do you called the A+
polls have Harris ahead so the polls
that he trusted had Harris ahead but
poly markets where people are just
betting uh didn't didn't have her you
know conclusively winning like that so
the odds were that you had a you know if
you were just looking at it as one of
many bets in your
portfolio you probably would have gone
with the odds meaning that it looked
like she might win yet the betting
markets were not saying that so you
probably would get a nice payoff in the
betting markets if the A+ poles were in
fact
reliable so everything he said is
logical it's mathematically and
statistically and of risk management
perfect so everything he said was
right uh the problem was the A+
polls how many of you thought the polls
were accurate and real and even trying
to be real by election
day I feel like 100% of the people who
follow me know that the polls were you
know some kind of a political structure
and not they're not really at least all
of them are not meant to be uh even
serious I mean I don't think they're
trying to be accurate I think they're
just backing their team now rasmuson was
they were Superstars yet again beat all
the A+ guys but they don't get mentioned
because if you're right all the time the
Democrats don't like to mention you
they'll leave you they'll leave you on
the list so I do wonder how many people
took Scott Galloway's advice and put
down their own big bets on Harris
um I and as I told you I think I
mentioned this before um I was very
confident that Trump would win I mean in
plenty of time to have placed the bet if
I wanted to I wasn't confident a year
ago but you know within a month of the
election if you were watching I think
all of you saw me say yeah Trump's going
to have the votes so your question would
be why didn't I bet on it was I lying to
you no I did bet on it I bet on it a
different way uh over the summer I
loaded up on Tesla stock and
Bitcoin the two things that you could
pretty well predict would go up if Trump
won
so I'm pretty happy with my Tesla and
Bitcoin anyway uh as you probably all
already know Congress tried to get away
with slipping in this resolution budget
bill that some call some call an omnius
bill but it's something in between and
they tried to do their usual Congress
trick which Thomas Massie called them
out and predicted you know months before
it happened because they always do
it and what they do is they wait until
it's right before Christmas where
everybody just cares about going home
and then they say either vote for this
foot tall thing that nobody could read
and has all kinds of pork in it or
you'll miss your Christmas your children
will hate you and so people being people
they're like ah no time to fix this I
can't fix the whole system I'll just say
yes and go home but that's what should
have
happened but it's a different
day it's a different day isn't it so
what happened instead was everybody
looked at this bill and said uh are you
really going to sign a bill that nobody
read and so people like me upon first
exposure to the story in X said
immediately no no no no we can't do this
anymore so I don't I don't need to know
what's in the bill I just need to know
it's a foot tall and that's it now there
were plenty of other reasons not to vote
for it but you only needed to know it
was a foot tall because that tells you
that the process doesn't work because
nobody's going to read the foot tall
thing and it's going to be full of pork
so you don't need to know anything
except it's a foot
tall I didn't need to know anything else
so I was a hard no on the first
second but of course you know I'm not
that influential by myself but you saw a
whole bunch of other people who have a
million plus followers on X and other
places say uh no no no
hell no hell no hard no would that have
made a
difference probably not probably not but
turns
out that there's a whole new Dynamic
now so I love saying that uh you know
it's like a reference to the Hulk I've
said this before but we have a
vake there's a vake on the Republican
side he actually
read the foot tall
Bill and and pulled out the important
parts for
us
what
what how is that even possible I would
love a video of just watching V sit down
with a foot tall Bill and pour through
it so quickly that you you you get to
see for the first time what a super
smart person can do
I'm pretty smart I couldn't do that
right so however however smart V is I
can't judge it because as soon as
somebody's a little bit smarter than you
are you really don't know how much
smarter there's no you have no mechanism
for measuring it because it's outside of
your domain so he's far smarter than I
am at least you know in this in this
element so he does what I've never seen
anybody do before he has a big audience
he's very credible we all know he's
working for the country not for himself
and he just tore into it he tore into it
and when he was done I said to myself I
have now heard the important
elements that's amazing now at the same
time uh
grock was able to look at the bill and
also summarize it now unfortunately the
summary was itself like I don't know 20
20 Pages or something so even a 20page
summary doesn't help you as much as you
hoped it would because there are too
many different elements or you know
completely different topics are all
being stuffed into this monstrosity so
if all you did is read the summary of a
thing you wouldn't necessarily know what
it was about because you kind of need to
hold you know get the context so I don't
think the summary helped us as much as
it should but it did confirm there are
way too many things in the bill and we
don't have to live like this
so V just penetrates this thing like a
spear you know like like he just stuck a
spear through it and he's holding it up
and saying oh and then enter Elon
Musk Elon Musk probably one of the most
credible people in the
world uh known to be smart we know he's
on our side our side being the country
not our side being the Republicans but
the country he's on the
countryside and he said hard
no and then he actually you know
escalated it because he kind of posted
about it a bunch and he got all the way
up to anybody who votes for it should be
primaried and he's the guy who has
hundreds of millions that he could put
into a a race to primary anybody and all
the politicians are afraid of being
primaried so within I don't know how
long did it take just a few hours the
bill went from something we assumed
would be signed because that's the way
it always happened no matter no matter
how much you complained to
dead to dead now what happened with uh
the the blowback when it got killed by
what looked like Elon musk's work
primarily well would you be surprised to
know that the Democrats back up to more
generic complaints about things that's
right learning absolutely nothing about
anything Republicans have specific
complaints that they thanks to VI and
others managed to pull out at this thing
very specific complaints this is a bad
idea don't do this this is a bad idea
and their complaint was instead of
defending the bill how many of you have
noticed that there isn't a single
Democrat defending the bill
how many of you did not notice that
until I just said it zero not a single
Democrat supports the
bill
none so they have to they have to be mad
because they you know they have to
oppose Republicans but they don't like
the bill either because there's nobody
who's dumb enough who thinks that a foot
tall Bill packed with crap is a good
idea IDE Democrats don't think it
Republicans don't think it so the only
thing they had was something about
musk so they go for the oh he's a he's a
co-president well he's like the real
speaker of the house oh oh I guess
Trump's not running things I guess I
guess an unelected person is running the
country now and they all sort of
simultaneously went to attack Elon Musk
again
remember they also agree with
him they're attacking him for something
they agree with which is this bill is a
ridiculous monstrosity and we should not
be governing this way they agree with
that and they still went after
him but their
argument was was sort of
childlike they they just wanted to say
stuff like oh uh Trump and musk sitting
in a tree that they must be lovers now
oh oh why why did Trump's you know just
delegate everything to an unelected
person all these generic crap
so I weighed in a little bit on it and
said um musk doesn't have any power from
the Republicans it was somebody who said
uh Republicans gave their power to to
musk and he's unelected and I said musk
doesn't have any
power he has no power he has only the
power of the support of The People Under
The Following conditions it's Common
Sense we all agree with them and in this
case both sides agree Democrats and
Republicans everybody agrees with him
and he's working for the benefit of the
people obviously now is it good for
musk's own companies of course is it
good for my company of course it's good
for everybody if if you can you know fix
the the
budget so as long as he's working for
the people and it's all the people and
as long as it's common sense and as long
as he does everything in public and as
long as he couldn't get away with any of
it unless he had massive backing by at
least one of the parties the one in
charge um I'm good with that and the
people who said but he wasn't elected he
wasn't elected I say that's true of all
of Trump's
advisers you know the the cabinet maybe
needs to be vetted and approved but if
Trump decides you're going to be my
adviser you know my Kelly Conway or
something my V they're not
voted so musk is a
citizen who has the power to make
recommendations and the power to say
things in public but if the Republicans
had been completely in favor of this
bill even if Elon thought it was a bad
idea would he have been able to kill
it I don't think so so so here's the
thing that the Democrats can't
understand because they're kind of a
top- Down organization you know the
orders come from who knows where at the
top and and go down
but Trump only exists because the base
wants him to musk is only part of this
process because the base wants him to
vake is only part of the process because
the the base wants them to etc etc etc
so the base is getting what they want if
if Democrats think oh these rich people
these rich people have taken over
without any votes nothing like that has
happened the the so-called rich people
even Trump have very little ability to
do anything outside of what the base
wants them to do that's how populism
works so then they start
complaining about the fact that the
Republicans have a a billionaire who's
working on their side oh so I guess you
only care about theill millionaire to
which I say have you heard of
Soros and Reed Hoffman and Mark Cuban
and Bill
Gates I mean there are a lot of
billionaires out there I think they're
just mad because we got the best
one if you were to rank the
billionaires we got the best one
um Bill Amman another
billionaire um suggests that the the
Bills should have uh they should be
required to have a footnote so you know
which Congress person added which
Provisions so you know who put in the
bad
stuff and I said to myself wait a minute
we don't know that you know maybe I
didn't think it'd be part of the bill
but I thought in some way that would be
part of the public record but it's not
so this bill is so bad that the people
who added things to it don't want you to
know their names
literally right there there was nobody
who came forward and said oh good news
people that that thing in that bill that
was all me like that that wouldn't even
be there if not for me so I I made that
happen literally they're trying to hide
their
contribution to the country they're
trying to hide it
uh and they're trying really hard so yes
that's a good idea we should know who
does what you might also know that the
that uh monstrosity of a budget was
going to refund the global engagement
center now that's part of the big um the
big industrial what do you call it the
the censorship industrial
complex this is the thing that we want
to kill more than just about anything
the these are the people who came after
the Federalist and daily wire so this is
a group that's literally trying to close
down right leaning
Publications and and you're telling me
that the speaker of the
house signed off on
this what the Republican speaker of the
house signed off on funding the global
engagement Center whose primary mission
is to shut down Republican stuff without
good
reasons how how in the world did this
happen and do you think that speaker
Johnson should lose his position because
he allowed this to
happen yes yeah hard yes yeah yeah you
should lose your job if you do this this
is not a small deal it might seem small
if you don't follow the news in detail
this is a big deal it's the biggest deal
the the censorship censorship is
basically the government because if you
can stop people from you know knowing
what's happening then you can control
what happens without directly getting
elected even so the censorship thing is
kind of the engine that drives
everything because opinion drives
everything after censorship
so yeah I I think you have to lose your
job if you put this in a bill and ask
your own team to sign for their own
destruction you have to lose your job
and I didn't personally have any big
problems with speaker Johnson I mean I
know that a lot of people had issues but
I didn't follow it too closely but no
there's no way that you should keep your
job if you signed off on this no
way you need you need to take a step
back you know maybe keep his job in
Congress but no you can't be the leader
this is not leadership
so and I was really touched by uh Molly
Hemingway who who's um works at the
Federalist she said
uh um well basically she said she takes
it personally like she's worked so hard
and the Federalist has worked so hard to
make sure that Republican and
conservative views are fully you know
fully
expressed so basically fighting hard for
your team if you're Republican or
conservative fighting hard for your team
and then and then the team puts in
basically the destruction of her entity
and they put that in a bill are you
kidding me this this is this is just
such a slap in the face and a stab in
the back for both the daily wire and the
Federalist this is so inappropriate like
like this is wow I mean it's just head
shaking how many Republicans were going
to vote for that
like if if musk had not stepped in and
again musk was really empowered by the
base so it's not just musk of course
um so here's what I
think I think there's something
incredibly good happening like
incredibly
good
and I feel like a a separate branch of
government has formed
spontaneously because it was required
we all noticed that the system the way
it was working was just driving us off a
a cliff we were just going to drive
ourselves into debt and Star Wars until
we're all dead so nothing was
working but here's what I think has
happened and I think I think Trump gets
all the credit right Trump gets all the
credit
because Trump managed to attract exactly
the right amount of talent and that
didn't happen on its own so if you want
to say oh you know he had all the help
from RFK Jr and V and from Elon Musk so
so really you know they were the powers
that pushed him over the finish line and
there's something to that but
remember that only happened because
Trump made himself attractive to voters
as well as important smart
people right the boss gets all the
credit it doesn't matter what Elon does
or V does or RFK Jr and and by the way
they would get tons of credit for doing
good work but the boss is the one who
attracts them the boss is the one who
has to say yes Trump of course was fully
supportive of both V and and Elon as
well as the whole base and saying nope
can't sign this
thing now here's what's
great I believe that we have somewhat
accidentally evolved into a system which
I wanted to call a Council of Elders but
it makes us sound old so I'm not going
to say
that and just to
simplify um there are a number of
opinion people who have more than a
million followers on
Ax who if they were all opposed to a
thing it would be really hard for Elon
to go forward with that thing or anybody
else who was on that side so I don't
think it's necessarily the the total
number of Voters because they don't get
to have a say until the next election
but I do think that Elon and um Trump
specifically are really really plugged
in to what I'll just randomly pick a
number I'm going say the top
50 smart people on their side top
50 what do you think the top 50 smartest
people who lean right said about this
bill I'll bet all 50 said no if all 50
of the smartest people most let's say
most persuasive I want to say
smartest if your 50 top most persuasive
people are on the same side and I think
they were um that empowers Trump and
that's what
empowers everybody who works for him and
you know and let's say Elon in this
situation
so the will of the people
is usually pretty accurately captured by
the people who have over a million
followers so you're not getting it
directly but they but we all have a you
know feet in the real
world so I feel like it's almost like
another form of government where the
people inform the people the influencers
who have a million plus followers Elon
is following to follow the people have a
million plus you can tell he responded
to me
yesterday when I when I weighed in on
this topic you know there there was
elon's comment so we know that he's
watching at least the larger
accounts and that allows him to know
when he's got backing and when he
doesn't do you think he would have done
this on his own if 40 of the top 50
right leaning pundits had said said no
we like this bill sign
that he might have argued it you know
still argu at his point try to change
our minds but I don't think it would
have been
cancelled so there does seem to be this
Council of Elders again they're not
they're not old some of them are young
uh that is very very important and it's
on X and it's informing the right people
to do the right things so it does seem
to be like a response to the fact that
nothing was
working and so this new new phenomenon
has stepped
in um we'll see how the uh Democrats are
doing
here um yeah swalwell and Joy Reed were
talking on MSNBC that you know musk is
like the speaker or the co-president and
one post on X and he controls Congress
so this is again them getting everything
wrong not understanding that everyone on
both sides hated this bill and that Elon
is doing the work of the people
transparently and right in front of us
and at Great personal
risk then kinzinger Adam kininger is on
CNN and he's calling Elon musy president
Elon and says Trump is the vice
president Trump now why did they do that
obviously the reason they do that is if
they they think that Trump's ego
will not allow him to have you know such
a
strong uh partner let's say so they
think they can drive a wedge between
them by going after Trump's
ego I don't think it's going to work
because here's here again is what they
get wrong about Trump now I've told you
this for
years but now you can all see it if you
think Trump doesn't like people are
smarter than him you're wrong Trump
really really likes smart people he
really likes them and he wants to work
with them and he wants to give them
credit but he's still the boss right the
boss gets the top credit because he
attracted the people to his
administration and if they do a good job
the boss gets the credit that's how it
works so we should all make sure that
when we're sort of talking about these
things that we give Elon his full share
of
credit but when you talk about it it
would be helpful if you also add you
know the boss gets the credit it has to
be that way just has to
be anyway
um so let's see um ran Paul cheekily
suggested that since the speaker of the
house doesn't need to be a member of
Congress uh that they could elect Elon
Musk as Speaker of the
House now the thing that makes me laugh
is that we've somehow gotten the idea
that there's no limit to how many jobs
Elon Musk can do at the same
time and I'm thinking to myself well it
is true we haven't found the limit yet
right for most people too would be too
many companies to run but he's running
several and then he's you know doing
doing the Doge thing which is more than
a full-time job so he's got something
like five or six full-time jobs you know
plus parent
Etc
and the only thing that I don't know is
how many times has he been cloned so far
because I've done the math of how many
hours a human can be awake and do work
and how many jobs Elon has and I'm
pretty sure there are at least two or
three of him by now
have to be at least at least two but
there might be three of them I think
he's already cloned himself do do you
think do you think underneath his skin
mask there might be like a Optimus robot
or something I don't know I I think
we're in the world of clones we just
don't know it yet I'm kidding meanwhile
X has reached one billion active users
and Elon calls it the group chat for
Earth and boy did it earn its little
title this week X is the reason that
bill got
killed you you could say it's you know a
lot of different reasons because it's a
bad bill whatever but if x did not exist
and exist in its current form with free
speech under musk I don't think that
would have stopped and you realize you
realize that that spending bill is part
of a guaranteed death spiral for the
country if we just sign every big pile
of bills and nobody says no we are dead
for sure like actually dead like not
just having a bad
day
dead you if the if the economy fails and
the country fails we're we're actually
dead and we were pretty
close and if we didn't have free speech
and x and a lot of billionaires were
willing to take big chances personally
and professionally we would not have
pulled back from the brink to me this
feels like pulling back from the brink
still got a lot of work to do but we did
not go over the cliff and we very very
easily could
have
um Joshua Steinman who worked in the
first Trump Administration says on a
post he says having worked through
multiple government shutdowns first as a
military officer then as a White House
staffer I can say with conviction
they're not real 10 times more efficient
during the
shutdown I believe that uh I believe
that X is 10 times more efficient when
they cut the staff by
80% and I do believe that you'll get
more done during a shutdown I believe
that um meanwhile according to uh the
hill uh the lawyers for Trump have some
kind of information that we don't know
yet
that a member of the New York jury that
convicted uh Trump in the New York case
uh that one of the jurors was uh
somehow um
somehow had there's evidence of a grave
juror misconduct during the trial now I
don't know what that would include grave
juror misconduct so that would suggest
that maybe they have some written
communication that would say they
weren't intending to be fair maybe maybe
they're connected to somebody and they
didn't admit it you know somebody in
politics maybe may maybe the had a phone
call with somebody they shouldn't have
been talking to maybe I don't know but
it's something like that do you think
that that will be enough to uh you know
throw out the case or anything I doubt
it because judge meren
merchan seems to be just an anti-trump
judge so I don't expect Justice in that
case at least from that
judge meanwhile in California I don't
know if you know that California voted
to ban gas driven cars starting in
20 what oh I think this is wrong isn't
it 2030 or
35 I wrote down 2025 but I think that
was a mistake somebody made on the on X
and I just copied it but anyway in a few
years the gas cars will be
banned
so 2035 right yeah so there was just a
typo when I saw
2035 um yeah we'll see how that goes
meanwhile Governor Nome in California
declared a bird flu emergency in
California I don't think that affects me
yet I don't know exactly what the flu
emergency is going to do but it doesn't
require me to wear a mask or get a
vaccination yet but uh we'll keep an eye
on that meanwhile you probably heard
that Proposition 36 in California passed
uh by
70% and you don't need to know the
details the summary of Proposition 36 is
California decided to make crime illegal
again that's all you need to know so
there are a bunch of changes but they
all have the same effect that you can't
just walk into a store and take what you
want walk out now if they catch you and
you can't do multiple crimes and get
slapped on the wrist every time you do
the crime you know it'll it'll go up in
severity if you keep doing the same
crime so it's stuff like that um Tough
Run fenel
people
Etc so there's a uh speaking of fenyl
there's
some kind of fental movie I don't know
what that's about but um I saw the
trailer for it so somebody's doing the
good work of turning it into a movie so
maybe the hearts and Minds can be moved
a little bit more toward getting a
solution but I did see a uh graph that
showed that opioid overdoses have gone
down in the past year or so and and
quite a
bit and uh people say why' they go down
well I can think of two reasons one is
Naran so the the antidote to the
overdose is now well enough understood
and all police officers have it in their
car uh all First Responders would have
it um a lot of big organizations would
have it probably schools a lot of
schools have it so some of it is a whole
bunch of people being saved by the Naran
that's the Naran I think is the
um brand of it not the not the
drug but um when I looked at the graph
it also was obvious to me that the only
thing that happened was the big spike in
overdose Des during the pandemic just
normalized so in other words if you look
at the you know there's this line up of
you know every year more fenel deaths
more and more then the pandemic hits and
it's like way more and now you know
we're we're in the aftermath and it's
back down to Baseline so if you were to
just take the prepandemic
slope and just draw a pencil line and
and connect it that's where we are now
so the only change is that the pandemic
bulge has now normalized back to a
horrible horrible problem that was one
of the biggest problems before the
pandemic so don't get happy about it
that it went down quite a bit it only
went down from the
bump the Baseline is still
increasing
now here's what I
wonder I just have a real problem and of
course I take this topic personally most
of you know my stepson died from a uh
overdose he had fentol system
and um you know I'm not happy with
China and China has promised several
times that they would take care of the
source and we know that they could but
they kind of slow walking it and saying
well yes we're doing all kinds of things
but they're staying ahead of us which we
don't
believe we think they're allowing it to
happen or at least they're not trying
hard enough to stop it here's what I
think I don't think we should throw this
in the category of just one more thing
we're talking to China about it's not
trade policy it's it's not even military
stuff it's not un stuff we should close
the
embassy until they fix this but we
should tell them it's temporary and just
say we're not comfortable having any
communication with you officially while
you're poisoning our citizens if you
stop this we'll reopen the the embassy
so we're not intending to close it
totally um and the embassy would do
services for you know American entities
in China so you need some of it but you
might there might be something where you
could close it so that China doesn't
have access to it and just don't have
any meetings with anybody in China and
the reason to do it is not that they
would care that much it's that it would
embarrass them the the purpose would be
to embarrass them
and apparently killing people with fenal
shipments doesn't embarrass them cuz it
kind of just looks like they're getting
revenge for the opium Wars long ago so I
don't think they're embarrassed by it
because they're doing it intentionally
and they're probably enjoying the
benefit of it you know but if we said
you know we can't even deal with you
like adults because you're murdering our
children so if you stop murdering our
children will'll open an embassy and
treat you like you would like to be
treated but we cannot we can't have a we
can't have a summit with you we can't we
just can't have a normal relationship
while you're killing our children and I
think you could still still be
professional about everything else we do
still trade with them you know even
while we're trying to reshore stuff but
I think we need to embarrass
them and I think we have to say look
we're going to temporarily shut it down
our Embassy and it's not going to last
long because it wouldn't take you long
to clean up this fenel stuff but take as
long as you want you just you just can't
have an embassy from the United States
or we kick them out of our Embassy maybe
you maybe you do the reverse just say
you can't have an embassy in the United
States while you're sending us
fenel and you just keep it just to that
one topic and you just say I'm sorry
you're you can't be in
the the nation of good countries we just
can't deal with you on that basis we we
don't have respect for you let's say it
this way we don't have respect for you
and you can't have an Embassy in our
country under these
conditions well
anyway um apparently the Supreme Court
is going to hear tick tok's appeal to
try to stay in business and intact zero
Hedges reporting and
uh so here's the deal I guess Trump has
offered that he could facilitate a sale
of tic tac to an American entity which
would satisfy the court order so then
Tik tock could remain but it would be
owned and managed in the data would be
in the United
States do you like that idea do you
think you should be
banned or would you prefer that an
American buy it well here's the answer
to the question it really depends which
American buys
it
if uh and something something very
interesting is about to
happen if Elon Musk bought Tik toac and
that's not going to happen but if he did
the Democrats would be completely
toasted because then the two biggest
sources of knowledge X and Tik Tock
would both be prot Trump Pro common
sense and that would be bad for
Democrats but also the other way if Reed
Hoffman and let's say some team of
investors bought Tik Tock well at least
Tik Tok would be an American company but
then you would worry that they've got
their finger on the scale and uh you
know they're basically causing the
outcome in the in the
elections
so if Tik Tock lean
left which it does but it was very prot
Trump this election
weirdly um and X people think it leans
right but I don't think it leans the
right as much as people
think that would be sort of a good
competition wouldn't it
but what happens if Trump puts together
the sale if Trump puts together the sale
presumably he's going to make sure that
some people who like him are the ones
who buy
it
so here's what Tik Tock might be missing
in this
story they have an opportunity for a
bidding war like you've never
seen so whatever is the current value of
Tik Tock you know the entire Tik tock if
they take the American piece and they
put it out the bid the Democrat
billionaires and the Republican
billionaires are going to have to
basically break the piggy bank because
neither side is going to be willing to
let the other have that much control of
the American
mind right there's literally there
probably would be no asset in the United
States besides X that would be that
valuable because it'd be valuable for
profits but way more valuable for
controlling the
country
so I think there could be the biggest
bidding war we've ever seen like crazy
bidding war so Tik Tock could probably
monetize this in a way that nobody's
ever seen and one of the ways that a
trump dealmaker could make this
palatable is to say that out loud say
hey Tik Tock you do understand
that there's going to be a bidding war
like you've never seen in your life
right you're going to make a lot of
money if you sell the American part and
you'll never have a better chance I mean
this this would be like an amazing
opportunity so my guess is that it will
get
sold to an American entity and probably
somebody that Trump
likes Disney meanwhile has decided to
get rid of the trans storyline in one of
their children's
movies is that even real did those words
just come out of my mouth yep so there's
a animated
show uh is it a movie or just a
show it's called win or lose an animated
show so maybe it's a TV show um about a
co-ed Middle School softball team and
there's some trans character in there
they decided to remove this is what
Disney said about it when it comes to
animated content content for a younger
audience we recognize that many parents
would prefer to discuss certain subjects
with their children on their own terms
and
timeline that's kind of
perfect thank you so Disney so now
Disney has paid Trump $15 million
through their ownership of ABC News and
George
stenopus and now they've uh deified at
least some of their content I I'd expect
more if you make a if you make a
statement like this you're going to have
to apply it to your other properties so
I think this is a big step but I I like
how well they said it so whoever was in
charge of crafting the statement for
Disney good job yeah yeah they're not
saying their own opinion they're saying
we recognize that parents would many
parents not all would prefer to discuss
certain things on their own terms and
timeline that's as perfect as you can
say that
I'm actually impressed just that the the
skill that went into the statement it's
it's a lot of
skill
meanwhile there's a the Washington
University in St Louis is reporting a
study where they uh put something like a
pacemaker device on people who were
depressed except instead of being a
pacemaker for your heart it would um it
would zap your Vagas nerve
in the neck and what they found is if
you stimulate the Vagas nerve just right
um it can eliminate depression symptoms
now they did this with people who had
tried a whole bunch of other things and
got no
relief so they knew these were not easy
cases these were hard cases and they got
a great
response but so on one hand I'm really
happy for anybody who has this problem
in their life cuz maybe they have
another future treatment if it all gets
approved
but yeah it's for severe treatment
resistant depression I mean it's that's
got to be the worst thing you could
possibly imagine and so this might help
him with it but I would like to make the
following
observation if you put a a mechanical
device in my body and it changes me from
being
depressed into not
depressed that's a personality change
and it's a personality Chang is driven
by
Hardware
so am I a
cyborg because if you can change my most
fundamental personality which is I'm
depressed all the time and I only have
depressed thoughts and depressed actions
to hey I'm having a good
day that's more than just fixing a
medical problem that's a whole different
personality I mean you're changing
people from Karen to non-caring that's a
personality
change and I'm in favor of it because I
don't think the people in this situation
should suffer one second longer so if
you can help them please do but I think
it's just an observation it's not I'm
not not a complaining one bit but it's a
complete
personality change so to me that's kind
of a cyborg you you're no longer what
you were when you were organic you're
something new that's a combination of
hardware and skin Weare kind of
cool no I hate it at
all a b biological machine that's right
all right ladies and gentlemen um I feel
like I missed a few stories today
there's been so much going on lately um
was there any story that you wanted me
to talk about I I feel like I'm done
with drones until something new happens
you're all okay with that right
feels
like yeah Naval had some great quotes
that I posted it's better if he just
read them in his own words I decided not
to talk about
them so the stock market's up
right um oh I think I didn't complete my
thought so normally when the when the
economy is strong enough that the FED
says we're not going to reduce rates or
we're not going to reduce them as much
as you thought
that usually causes the stock market to
tank and it did on the first day but
today it should still be down because
the FED is still not going to lower
rates as fast as we thought but it went
up
sharply here's why I think it's the
budget I think that when the country
realized that maybe we can stop this an
control budget spending which is our
biggest problem don't you know just to
be clear it's our biggest problem by far
it's the one thing that could end the
entire country nothing else could I mean
short of a nuclear war which I don't see
happening almost nothing could end
America but this could the that could it
could end the entire
experiment and so you see you see the
uh the Council of Elders you see the VES
the Elon musks uh enter the
breach
and at the very least they did the first
thing you need to do which is stop this
signature of that foot tall bill that
nobody
likes now I think the world is
shocked that that was so
handily and well handled because the
politicians are in this situation where
they sort of can't do their jobs you
know they they don't want to go against
their party and everybody wants to go
home for Christmas their family will be
mad they're really they can't get it
done so the fact that this new mechanism
appeared the new mechanism is V reads
the thing in one day you didn't see that
coming tells us what's in it you didn't
see that
coming and then Elon goes in hard like
he you know he he went in like the bull
and then he got complete backing 100%
backing from everybody well everybody on
the right and like I said nobody on the
left really
disagrees they just don't love the fact
that the right is getting stuff done so
I think that the stock market is
responding to the fact that America may
have corrected its biggest
problem and it's the big one the biggest
of the big now that's a long way from
doging our way down to a budget that
works where you know we haven't doed a
bit but we did
show that if the
if the people on
X have a strong opinion about something
things are going to change and that's
new so I think we're in one of the best
situations the country's ever been in
not only are we at the cusp of a super
cycle the likes of which we might never
see again which is robots and and auto
you know Auto self-driving taxis flying
cars drones
you know probably probably the the most
important cycle ever and the only thing
that could stop us is the runaway
debt and we might have that under
control soon it's not under control but
we have all the right
players and we have the support to do it
um at least conceptually we have the
support
so um
all right is there anything else I
should have
mentioned uh it's a Vegas nerve V AAS
not Vegas as in Las Vegas no V
Aus Vegas nerve VH
us uh can I wax poetic about rockel
Welch you know I'm going to tell you
later when I go private on uh
locals why that comment blew my mind but
I can't say it I can't say it to the
rest of
you
um all
right all right I'm going to talk to the
uh people on locals privately the
subscribers if you were wondering how to
see Dilbert you can see it if you
subscribe on X or on locals but locals
