good morning everybody
and
you are in for a treat today oh i don't
mean the live stream i just mean it's
going to be an amazing day for you
probably one of the best ones you've
ever had
why
because
i said so did you know that reality is
largely subjective
and what that means is that however you
think of reality is for all practical
purposes that's what it is for you
and today
your reality
is going to be great
better than yesterday and yesterday
might have been pretty good
for for some of you
some of you have your coffee ready are
thinking
you know yesterday was pretty good
pretty darn good
others not so much
but
if you'd like to take it to the ultimate
level
i'm talking
extreme extreme
goodness then all you need is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker shells just
like a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
except for a russian missile cruiser
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dope of being here
today it's the thing that makes you
tingle
can you feel it
you feel it in the back your neck right
there
yeah you can feel it a little bit can't
you
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
joins all of us in unison in one big
god-like experience go
you know
i wasn't expecting to feel connected to
the
divine i thought it was just going to be
a really tasty cup of coffee and one of
the best days ever
but
it exceeded my expectations
they were pretty high wow
how about that
well you do you know what goes well
with the simultaneous sip
poison pills
poison pills and beverages
on locals i was uh i was suggested that
maybe
poison pills and coffee would be a good
title for today's livestream
but
here's the story so you may have heard
already that
twitter has adopted what's called a
poison pill
now for those of you who don't
understand economics and
mergers and acquisitions and all the
intricacies of what companies can do for
their back and forth
i'd like to take a moment
to explain the economics of it
blah blah blah
um
any questions
well it seems that a poison pill um
would be any one of a number of things
that a company would implement
a set of rules that would say
should we be
a bid on
certain rules will go into play that
would make it a bad idea for the person
trying to buy it
to buy it so uh they've actually
adopted a poison pill
which uh would dilute the shares if
someone tries to buy them so in other
words the more you tried to buy
the less it would change your that
doesn't make sense right but you try to
buy more but they would dilute the stock
so you're not owning more more
as a percentage
so
is that good for stockholders
to have a whole rule that would keep
them from getting a 38 gain in one day
yeah how many of the stockholders are
saying to themselves hey
oh wait a minute
wait wait a minute
don't you think
now and by the way i i i always forget
to disclose
but i do own twitter stock
in
a very small amount compared to you know
as a percentage
and also tesla
so i do i do have a dog in the fight but
it's more like a chihuahua
everybody cool with that
right so i do have a chihuahua in the
fight it doesn't feel like it would have
been enough to bias me but it probably
does
like i don't i don't feel the bias
but you have to assume it's there right
can you all agree with this this
statement
i believe i'm giving you an honest
internal opinion
that doesn't feel like my stock
ownership in those two companies because
it's not a big part of my portfolio or
anything it doesn't feel like it's
changing my opinion
but you know it is
don't you
if you understand economics and you
understand psychology
you understand anything about follow the
money it doesn't really need to be that
much money
[Laughter]
that's actually the scariest part about
follow the money the scariest part by
far
is it doesn't take much
if it's a lot of money you can guarantee
bad behavior you know i've told you that
a million times anything with a lot of
money at stake and there's any
opportunity for somebody to get at it oh
it's going to happen
just just a matter of time
it's like elections
you don't have to wonder if elections
have
integrity and will always have integrity
because there's a lot to gain
somebody's going to get that one
you don't know if it's happened yet
but yeah somebody's going to get into
one of those
because people have the reason and the
time and the incentive and
sooner or later somebody will have the
skill
um i don't know where that came from
something about a poison pill
but here's the defense against the
poison pill
i think
now keep in mind
that everything you hear from this point
on
about this whole twitter
elon musk purchase thing
everybody talking about it
will be somebody who doesn't understand
it
because as soon as you get into the
merger and acquisition
and then all of the the legal challenges
that are possible around it and the
poison pills and stuff
it's just a little bit more than
the average journalist
quite has a grasp on and even the
business journalists i think would be
the most
humble
because they know the most
so so here's something you can test
if you're watching the coverage
if you're watching the people who are
were the business journalists they'd
know the most
they would probably be the most humble
about predicting what happens
because it's a little bit more
unpredictable
than the
maybe regular journalists will say so
just something to watch for the more the
more somebody knows about it
the more humble they will be about being
able to predict it
if i had have i made a prediction yet
about whether musk will succeed
have i made that prediction
um
i guess i should right
now
for those of you new to
my material
if i make a prediction i like to make a
prediction based on something that i
have some special insight about
so in other words if it looks like it's
a mass hysteria then i feel like i can
spot those better than other people
because you know background in hypnosis
and i pay attention to that stuff etc
but there are other situations and this
is one of them
in which you probably would want
you know
a lawyer somebody's worked in this space
to be your better pro
prognosticator but but i'm going to play
anyway
so let me
let's uh let's see what we can say about
the situation without knowing much okay
i'll boil it down to its simplest form
you and i don't know what elon musk's
options are
do you think he does
do you think that elon musk
has conceived of the entire toolbox of
options
he's talked about an option b
but don't you think he's talked about
option a through
f or g
because he's not us right
so you have to start with the assumption
that whatever you and i and the business
journalists say about this
it's not how he's thinking and i'll say
it again
if any of us could think like him
well we'd probably be doing a lot better
than we're doing
it it would seem to suggest if you're
that smart that you can second guess
them and you know and you know what he's
going to do
good for you
you you should be you should be pretty
rich by now
but we don't know
so
all right so i'm going to say some
things that uh you all agree with
all right so i'll give you some
assumptions you agree with
assumption number one
elon musk would probably not go into
this
without having at least a strong
intuition
that he has enough tools to get it done
and also that he anticipated
a let's say an obvious range of defenses
the obvious defenses would be a poison
pill
so do you think he anticipated a poison
pill
it's elon musk right
it's not it's not like the first time
he's ever done anything
yeah it's like he doesn't do you think
he didn't talk to anybody or doesn't
have a lawyer wouldn't have thought of
it on his own never heard of a poison
pill
right no it's inconceivable
it's inconceivable that he did not
consider that
a likely possibility
which suggests that he has a defense
and the defense is pretty clean
he's offering so much
that if the board rejects it or or
creates a poison pill which is
effectively
rejecting it
just in a different way
um
so
if uh
you just have to assume that musk
anticipated all this stuff and that he's
he thinks that he could win a court case
if the board
does something that is clearly against
the interest of the stockholders
now to me that would look like an easy
win
but
you know do i know anything about
you know
this kind of lawsuit nothing
but if he asked me just commonsensically
do you think
that turning down a 38 one-day gain in
twitter
would be something the stockholders
would want
and by the way elon musk is saying just
put it up to a vote of the stockholders
musk is not even saying
that he'll take the company no matter
what
musk has actually said the stockholders
if they vote for a yes
and i think
i think if the stockholders at large
voted against it
then he would probably conclude
that they had judged it's not in their
best interests
and probably that would be the end of it
i think
so
don't you think that uh
musk could win in court if he at least
said you should have put it to the
stockholders instead of the board
deciding
i think he could win that
or at least he'd have a good chance of
winning it
so
you know maybe enough of a risk that
that it made sense as a risk management
thing all right then there's a bigger
problem um
and this from uh i guess
a former sec chair
uh
named pitt told fox business maria
botterola
he said quote my concern is that this
administration is pretty much guaranteed
to oppose this kind of bid
in other words he thinks that
congress or somebody and the government
will try to stop it
some entity or multiple entities because
it's just not the sort of thing that
they're likely to support
now do you think that
musk would have anticipated
the democrat
you know
parts of the government trying to stop
him with government power
probably
all right
wouldn't you think
now i'm not saying that you and i would
have thought of it
necessarily
i mean
if i were in that position would i have
even thought of that i guess i would
have had to and i would have been
advised of it and certainly somebody
would have mentioned it right it would
have come up in conversation
so yeah
you have to assume he knows
so
so unless you believe that musk has a
plan that doesn't involve buying it
like some clever plan about pump and
dump
so i would rule out pump and dump
would you agree with that assumption
some pump and dump meaning
that he buys some shares he talks about
what's going to happen
but he's not really serious about it
and then the shares go up and he sells
it at a profit and he you know gets out
by making a billion dollars overnight
i don't know if he needs another billion
dollars
do you think he would take that hit to
his brand and his person and his yeah
just his personal image do you think he
would take that hit
for one billion dollars
he's worth what over 200 billion
i can't see him taking that half of one
percent
gain at the expense of basically the
most valuable asset on the planet right
now which is his reputation
i would argue that musk's reputation is
i had to say bran because
it's overused is probably worth more
than his actual fortune
because of the impact he can have on
things because of the the brand he has
basically
so
um if you assume that musk has thought
through all the options and you believe
that he genuinely wants to take over the
company it's not some kind of a destroy
the company play or
make a quick buck
i'm going to guess
that he thinks he can beat all of these
elements
what do you think
i'm going to say i'm going to say if he
thinks he can do it
do you want to bet against him
oh let me put it this way
i think it comes down to whether musk
himself believes he can get it done and
he said publicly he wasn't sure
right so he said himself i think as
recently as yesterday maybe that he
wasn't sure he could get it done
but that's different than
yeah and we don't know if plan b is
another way to buy it
or if plan b is just going to the courts
and saying hey the board of directors is
not pursuing their fiduciary
responsibility
meaning that they're not doing their job
that's just the big word for doing their
job of taking care of the stockholders
um
using hand in a sentence
i don't know what that means all right
um
is it weird to think that we're talking
we're having a
like a serious conversation in public
about whether the democrat-led
government
will try to squash elon musk who is
trying to promote free speech
in other words we're actually saying
matter-of-factly
that the government of the united states
will act publicly
with no secret whatsoever act publicly
to squash
the biggest free speech movement
of
since
a long time right
has it been a long time since something
this important to free speech was even
a topic
and the government itself
would be the thing to shut it down
now of course they would make arguments
that they're
uh you know they're
they would make arguments that their
uh constituents would believe
but it to me it would look exactly like
the government
trying to
restrict speech
what
how is that okay
that feels like the farthest thing from
okay
so
here's more to my prediction
who do you think the public is going to
side with
it's weird to even see that the
democrats took a solid swing as siding
in favor of censorship which they called
moderation
that they they actually
they took a legitimate try
to see if they could make a case
for less free speech
what
now it does
it seems a little desperate doesn't it
like if you're arguing against freedom
of speech in the united states because
it's your best
play they've been reduced to that's
their best play
well you know
we still got one thing we can do
you know everything's going right badly
or policies look like a disaster but
we always have this thing we can do we
can
i think we can get the public on our
side by trying to restrict free speech
that's it
that's your strategy that's literally
the plan
it might work who knows
there's a little back and forth uh with
musk and uh a
reddit i don't know if he's the ceo or
prior ceo maybe it's prior i can't his
last name is yeshin
somebody will tell you in the comments
anyway
he's a big deal in the uh tech world and
from reddit in particular
and he did this long
thread which i loved in one sense that
he he sees clearly the two movies
and he's calling it out and here's
something that actually surprised me
so see if you
can even believe that this is true
i'm going to say i do believe it's true
because is not really something you lie
about it's a he's giving his personal
report
he says all my left-wing woke friends
are convinced
that the social media platforms uphold
the white supremacist misogynistic
patriarchy and they have plenty of
screenshots and evidence
in other words the people on the left
are having an identical experience
to the people on the right which is hey
why why are they only censoring things
that agree with me
now
i spend you know as much time in a
bubble as anybody else
like i would love to tell you i'm i'm
the guy who can go from bubble to bubble
but i'm not
i'm not sure anybody can
so
i didn't know this was going on did you
and i think it has to do with just the
way they talk about it
in their world there's you know too much
you know racist nazi misogynist
anti-lgbtq stuff
because there would always be too much
wouldn't there
always be too much like what's the right
amount
if you don't like it what's the right
amount of it the right amount is none of
course there's too much so it does it
makes perfect sense you know once he
points it out i so i admit i was
somewhat blind to it
but it makes perfect sense that the
people on the left are convinced that
the platforms are biased against them
while the people on the right have their
own
good examples and apparently they're
good examples on both sides but i don't
think they're talking about exactly the
same thing
right
when when the left is talking about
stuff they're talking about really
stuff closer to hate speech
but when the right is getting banned it
tends to be
a little bit more opinion related this
seems to me i don't know
maybe maybe that's my bubble too
so don't pay attention to that
all right let's talk about that big
missile cruiser the flagship of the
russian
uh baltic and it sunk got hit i guess
the u.s is saying that ukraine hit it
with two neptune missiles
two
now
how many do you think they fired
you know isn't that like a key question
what if they only fired two
and they both hit the flagship
how good are these missiles
and let me ask you this
how often or how recently besides this
conflict
have neptune missiles actually been used
in conflict
can anybody answer that
because
i don't know how you could stop them
apparently russia
their flagship didn't have any
countermeasures because if they only
fired two
somebody says never and that feels like
the right answer doesn't it
yeah falklands was an exo-set but
aren't these types of missiles
kind of really likely to hit where you
aim them
and they're hard to stop i mean compared
to anything yeah so people are saying
neptune's brand new
so
three to ten percent failure rate
and then that would be mostly mechanical
right that wouldn't even be based on
counter measures
am i right
that if you're looking at the neptune
failing it's probably not because it got
shot down
probably not
all right so we're we're always guessing
on some of the military stuff here so
keep in mind that i don't know anything
about the military so
you know do your own fact checking on
that stuff
russia is still saying it was an
on-board fire
uh at the same time that their state tv
is saying that there must be retaliation
for the missiles
that sunk it
on the in in the explosion that was not
caused by the missiles that sunk it
because it was an onboard fire
so the onboard fire that
sunk it
uh not caused by missiles um there
should be some revenge for it the state
tv says
and maybe you know could get bad and
maybe an attack on nato or the united
states
because of the missiles that were fired
that weren't fired
because really no missile said it was an
onboard fire
that's actually what the russian public
is being told
literally both things at the same time
that it was a fire
and that there ought to be some revenge
for that fire
what
all right
um
the biggest impact of that musk sinking
i don't think will be on ukraine i'm not
sure it makes that much difference so
militarily probably not that much of a
difference
apparently the missile cruiser
was used to fire missiles that could
have been fired from land so it was just
another way to fire missiles that russia
has plenty of apparently so it shouldn't
make any difference in firepower it
probably doesn't make that much
difference in
command and control i would think
i don't know maybe there's somebody
who's a naval expert but i didn't see
anything in the news about them losing
some kind of command structure i only
saw that they lost a lot of missiles
that
they could replace from land-based
missiles
so it probably doesn't make that much
difference militarily might make some
difference in terms of morale or getting
the russian public all riled up but by
far the biggest impact is probably
china noticing
that you can't stop a neptune missile
and if china wants to take taiwan
it's gonna have to do it with some boats
and do you know what taiwan is
stockpiling
because taiwan has money
and they're not dumb and they're good at
planning ahead and they know exactly
what the risks are do you know how many
neptune missiles are heading for taiwan
right now
i don't know either
but it's not two
i'll bet it's a i'll bet it's something
like a shield
and
couldn't that make taiwan essentially
unconquerable
i mean it could be bombed into rubble
but do you think china would do that
do you think china would bomb into
rubble taiwan
i mean i suppose
yeah we get used to somebody says yes
i suppose anything's possible i mean a
lot of people didn't see ukraine coming
but a lot of people did a lot of people
did
all right
um
what a day
so
there's more stories about the war
crimes and
uh
the places that the russians occupied
and there's more credible stories coming
out of there but i'm not doubting that
there were war crimes
but it's a little suspicious that they
only happen on one side
i don't know what to do with that
because when it's so obvious that you're
being fed a narrative as opposed to
anything that looks like news
how are you supposed to take sides
exactly
like how do you think sides
like it just feels like there's a lot of
bad people doing a lot of bad things
over there
um
but here's
here's my thing
let me here's a little mental experiment
imagine let's go back 10 years
just randomly 10 years
do you think that the cia 10 years ago
would have started a let's say a civil
war in russia
if they could
or a revolution or a civil war
do you think the cia would have done
that if they could
i feel like they would
now do you think that russia
would have tried to turn the united
states against each other in some say
that sort of a civil war if it could
if it could
do do you think putin would try that if
he could
probably yes
because we saw in the 2016 election
cycle
that russia did seem to like promote
some
uh black lives matter activities you
know like fake ones that looked like
they were just designed to cause
conflict
you know as if they just wanted to cause
trouble as sort of a civil war so would
we would we agree that both the united
states and russia if they could
would create a civil war for the other
everybody on on board with that
if they could
uh i don't think anybody disagrees right
all right
now that brings me to looking at the
ukraine
russia conflict
am i wrong that from my perspective
it's a bunch of russian looking people
sometimes they speak russian sometimes
not but it's a bunch of russian looking
people fighting a bunch of russian
looking people
in an area that is maybe russia and
maybe not
but some part of them thinks it's not
and it's its own nation but some of the
others think you should be part of that
nation
isn't that exactly a civil war
that's exactly a civil war
because there's always one part of the
civil war that thinks they need to be an
independent nation right and then the
other side says no you're not you're
you're really more like us than than not
and there's some reason we have to be
together
so
did the united states
with his control over nato and maybe
with their willing uh
willingness
did we create a civil war
in russia it's just that we're using
ukraine as a allegedly independent
country because because you know it is
treated
that i'm not going to say allegedly
let me be very clear
ukraine is a sovereign country
by all the all the normal rules of
things it is a country
i'm just saying
that that distinction may have blinded
us to the fact
it sure looks like
somebody created a civil war in russia
but disguised it as a conflict across
borders
when it just looks like somebody created
a civil war
because it's hard to explain everything
that got us to this point
unless it was intentional
now we don't know that do i have any
evidence of that no no so i'm just
saying the only thing i can say is if
you're looking at it completely
objectively like if you were if you were
an alien from another planet
you just came down and said look we're
just going to give you the facts and you
don't have any biases because you're
from another planet and we're going to
describe what ukraine is
without calling it a nation
then we're going to describe what russia
is
and then we're going to say does that
look like
sort of a civil war
and does it look like maybe the united
states
did a number of things which in
retrospect look like they contributed to
this war
it does look like that doesn't it
but that doesn't mean it is that
because remember i just got done talking
about how
half the country seems one movie about
social platforms or bias one way and the
other sees the other movie i'm just
saying that there's a whole movie we're
not watching
the movie we're not watching is the one
that has the magic trick
and the magic trick is ukraine uh
that's its own country and by the way it
is its own country
let me be completely clear
it's a sovereign country that was
attacked by russia
but wow does it on another level sort of
look like we promoted a civil war
in a russia-ish
area
let me ask you
how many how many of you
hear that framing for the first time and
just said holy
did did anybody have that experience
just now
because sometimes if you're the okay i
am seeing some yeses on that a lot of
no's because some of you were already
there or or don't buy the framing i
guess
yeah a lot of yeses now for those of you
guys yes and it's maybe you know 20 of
you or whatever it's not everybody
um
isn't it isn't it a total mind to
see that you can look at the same
information
and that like an optical illusion i can
just tell you oh it's not the ladies
looking at each other it's the
it's the flower or whatever and then
suddenly your brain goes
and you can see the vases or vases and
flowers or whatever
it's such like a
it can really play with your head when
you realize how gas-lit you could be
doesn't mean you are
but it allows you to imagine how easily
you could be completely bamboozled
and one of the things that i've said
helps you understand the world
is understanding magic tricks
that doesn't sound uh
like it makes sense right but actual
like stage magic
and the reason is that if you spend
enough time thinking about how tricks
are done and you learn how to do them
yourself
you you look for the diversion
so when i look at politics
one of my just automatic filters is okay
what's the diversion
to the magic check
it's not always there
and maybe sometimes it misleads me to
think there is one when there isn't so
it could be a frame that misleads you as
well
but
i feel as if
thinking that things could be diversions
is a real healthy
productive way to look at any political
situation because it does feel like
they're doing intentional diversions
well we know that i mean
i'm not the the person who discovered
that
but it just helps to always have that
frame in mind
noam chomsky noted uh intellectual
provocative person on the left i guess
you'd say
uh has an iq of like uh
ten thousand
uh he's very smart
his iq is ten thousand
roughly i don't know rounding it up
um
and he he's getting a lot of
pushback because he says the only way
that the ukraine russia thing gets
settled is with a negotiated settlement
that ukraine isn't going to like
i mean i'm paraphrasing way too much but
basically he's just saying that's the
only way it ends it's not going to be
like a military victory and he's getting
he's getting pushback from that
and i'm thinking
what's the pushback on that
does anybody have a different opinion
because even even if one side sort of
sort of wins
it's not like they conquered the other
country it just means that they beat
their military down to the point where
one wants to talk
but
now now here's here's something that you
can take into your daily life this is
like a a super useful
uh persuasion trick
and this is what chomsky is using and
he's basically saying and again i'm
going to over paraphrase him so i hope i
don't get i hope i don't lose the
essence
but i think the essence of the argument
is if you know where it's going to end
up
why would you put up with all that pain
to get there
like you know where it's going to end up
it's going to be this negotiated thing
and yeah i get that
russia likes to negotiate and fight at
the same time
so you know if they get a battlefield
win
at the same time they're negotiating
that's a little good but if they're if
their missile cruiser flagship ship gets
sunk
well maybe that's a little bad
negotiating position but the russians
like to fight and negotiate at the same
time
but i don't know that it's going to make
that much difference is it
and this is what chomsky was saying
if you if you know where it's going to
end up
you might as well just start now just
just get it over with
but people can't put themselves in that
mindset now here's here's where this
helps you in the real world
you find yourself in let's say an
argument with a spouse
but you know from your history that
you're going to get over it
it'll probably take two days
and you've been through the cycle before
you'll be mad for a night you'll be
better tomorrow whatever it is
but if you know where it's going
have you ever said this to your loved
one spouse family member just your
co-worker somebody important to you have
you ever said all right you know where
this is going to end
in two days we're going to be over it
because we always are
and we're going to say well that wasn't
that important but we were in a bad mood
well we just go there now
and you should see what people say when
you say that to them it's almost like
you time traveled
because if they also know
yeah that's where it's going to go
because it always does you can actually
sometimes
get people to you know think themselves
into that future
and then negotiate as though the future
is already here in other words making
them imagine
you know where it's going to end
this is very similar to life exactly so
in the comments exactly as the time i
was going to say it is very similar to
the life is short
and actually you can use them at the
same time
look
should we spend 48 hours being mad at
each other
when life is short
pleasure is rare
we know that in two days we're going to
be right with each other
why do we start now
now that's never worked instantly in my
experience
it doesn't change anybody right around
but i feel like it makes a difference
i feel like at least changes the tone of
things if you make them think toward the
inevitability of
it being over and not mattering in the
long run and this is also related to the
are you going to be thinking this on
your deathbed
that one i use all the time
it's really good just just say to
anybody especially if they're younger
you know the younger they are the more
ridiculous it is that they can imagine
this would matter when they died
right and if it's not important when you
die it is probably not that important
right now
right
so there's your your personal uh advice
for the day and that's why
you come
is it for the coffee and the
simultaneous is it for the
the great uh camaraderie
that we experience
maybe it's all of that
um
and that
is only one of the things i was going to
say
uh
i thought that was the end of my notes
but hey what there's lots more
so cnn does this thing that i i'm so
fascinated by because it works
which is they'll they'll print a story
that's
factual
and i'll read it as far as i know i'll
read it and i'll say oh that looks like
completely unbiased
reporting
and then i'll look at the headline
or the first sentence
like you know the the introductory
sentence those are the things people
actually remember because people don't
really finish articles i don't know if
you know that we kind of get the gist of
it and then go to the next thing and get
the gist of that that's the way people
consume most things
and
so when when cnn does this trick where
the title or the first sentence doesn't
match at all to the content
i always laugh because it works
like it's so is so bold
it's so
so icky
but it works so it's like a serial
killer
who gets away with it for a long time
you know of course i want them to be
caught and punished and
you know i feel bad for the the victims
of course
but i also think well that's a good
serial killer
that is someone who knows how to do his
job and when i see somebody who can do
their job well
even if it's not a job i need
i still have some respect for the hard
work and me
and that
so where i was going on this is there's
a story on cnn's site
about the uh the text messages that have
been surfaced about the january 6
the republican allies of the president
so the allies were gop you know mike lee
and mark meadows and there were some
some text going back and forth so let me
tell you how cnn framed it
and then i'll tell you what the messages
actually tell you
okay see if these look at all the same
all right cnn's framing is this
quote the messages reveal how two gop
allies of uh then president trump
lobbied and encouraged the white house
in its effort to overturn the election
so their framing is that the messages
show how they were lobbying and
encouraging the white house in its
efforts to overturn the election
now what does overturn the election
sound like to you
sort of like a
like a coup or something doesn't it
now it's not technically incorrect is it
because
those words if you just look to them in
their you know straight definition
that is what the president and his
allies were trying to do
they were in fact
trying to get a different result
so i i may think they acknowledge that
right it is because they thought the
result was
rigged
so they they thought the different
result would be justified
they weren't randomly wanting a
different result or just because they
lost no evidence of that right but when
they say something like
their efforts to overturn the election
doesn't your brain just translate that
into insurrection
it does doesn't it
so so now they've they've framed it so
my brain has translated it into an
insurrection
and then they give us the content and i
appreciate that that was actually
interesting trade so you could actually
see the exchanges and the exchanges very
clearly very clearly
indicate that both people
thought the election was genuinely
sketchy
and they genuinely just wanted to make
sure it had time to get audited
that's what the messages say in other
words the messages are totally
exculpatory
completely
it's it's completely
explaining that the people involved were
not involved in an insurrection
they were involved in according to their
many texts back and forth
trying to stop one
very clearly
they're trying to stop a stolen election
there's not one thing in any of these
texts to suggest that they don't
genuinely believe
there's at least something that needs to
be looked into
right i mean they're not magic so they
don't know what happened but the way
they talk about it
is very very clear
that these two people and their allies
genuinely believe
this result looked too sketchy
to be credible
and that they were trying to fix not
only the credibility of the system but
to get the right right answer as they
saw it
and they even made i forget which one of
them but it doesn't matter in this
context even made the
maybe i wrote it down
uh
yeah they're talking about approaching
it firmly and intelligently
uh being being compatible completely
compatible with the constitution all
right this is from mike lee right
he says mike lee said in a text message
i don't purport to know who fits into
which category uh i know only that this
will not and
that this will end badly for the
president unless
we have the constitution on our side
and unless these states submit new
slates blah blah blah so in other words
unless
unless everything is constitutional
this is a bad idea
that's what the alleged insurrectionists
were saying
these guys have been painted as
insurrectionists and then in their own
words are saying
we damn well be better be compatible
with the constitution
and it doesn't sound to me he's saying
let's be weasels with the constitution
that's not there
it looks like these people want to be
absolutely straight down the line
if it's constitutional
we should make sure that these elections
are were done right because they don't
look it
now is that not
exactly their job
do you would you want members of
congress of either side
suppose this had gone the other way
suppose the democrats in congress had
legitimately believed
that the election was was rigged because
it just looked like it
would you be disappointed in democrat
leaders of congress
if you saw their text messages and you
saw that they were legitimately
legitimately trying to follow the
constitution
and look into something that looked like
maybe in this hypothetical
republican mischief and it just would
take two days let's just find out if the
election was credible
i would support those
those congress people would you
if they if you knew in their own words
their own words so there's no doubt
about what they were thinking because
there's a
long exchange
if you saw their own thinking that they
were trying to save the republic stay
true to the constitution and fix what
could be one of the biggest problems the
the republic has ever faced which is a
sketchy election that looks sketchy
maybe we've had ones in the past
that were sketchy we didn't know it but
this one looks sketchy
that's different
if you ignore one that looks sketchy you
have some explaining to do because you
didn't get elected to ignore big
problems
you got elected to do exactly what mike
lee was trying to do
exactly that make sure the election was
fair
mike lee should get like some kind of
award for this
and and and cnn is like throwing him
into the insurrectionist bucket
with their overturned the election
rhetoric
but already it's softening isn't it
already it's softening
because they didn't use the word
insurrection
and i feel like that's new
do you think you could have used the
word insurrection
in an article in which all of the
content of the article
proved it wasn't one
at least in terms of these gop allies
they were clearly not insurrectionists
clearly
so this is just mind-boggling that the
entire uh the entire thing at least in
terms of the republican allies of the
president
is completely shown to be
exactly what we hired them to do
and i would say that if these had been
democrats doing the same thing in the
other direction that is what we hired
them to do
it's just mind-boggling all right
um i saw one military expert say
that putin doesn't want to necessarily
capture the capital and take over all of
ukraine what he wants to do is destroy
the
ukrainian armed forces
and i thought to myself
why would that be a goal
does that even make sense
it makes sense for the ukrainians to
destroy the russian armed forces
because that would likely cause them to
retreat and maybe not try it again
right i'm not a military expert but to
me it seems that it would make sense for
ukraine to try to win outright
but suppose russia won outright but the
only thing they were going for was to
destroy the ukrainian military
and then what
pull back
does that even make sense
because if all they did was destroy the
ukrainian military but they don't
take control of the country
wouldn't the ukrainian military
reconstitute
and wouldn't they have better stuff than
last time
and wouldn't it be more nato friendly
than ever
like how in the world
does this opinion make sense
it might make sense by the way
this is exactly the kind of topic you
should you should approach with
maximum humility
hard for me to do i know but maybe
easier for you
but do you think we have any idea what's
going on over there this is an expert
who i would acknowledge
seems to have the resume of an actual
expert
and i don't even understand this like it
doesn't even make sense like on a
logical level like what would be the
point of any of that
to destroy the military and go home
and that's what passes for expert
opinion but again if we're realistic
maybe that is a good opinion i just
don't understand it
well biden's support is dropping fast
among young young people
uh so i guess millennials and generation
z
he's going for like 60 supports like 40
support
that's a pretty big drop
from 60 percent
support to 40 percent
in young people
what
and
if you're keeping track
um
president biden among all of the
different demographic groups you know if
you're looking at hispanics you're
looking at the
black
voters whatever group you're looking at
i think he's lost approval in
every group
i wonder if that's true
maybe he has more approval in lgbtq or
there might be some demographic group
but i feel like
how can you how can you lose support in
just about every group
except the karen's right except women
about is it uh
white college educated women
yeah i think that's
you know i said before that it seems
like
the democrats will inevitably or already
have are the party of women
and the republicans are the party of men
both of course will have men and women
of them but in terms of a
sort of a dominant
um overarching philosophy
republicans are sort of
you know
safety through power you know prosperity
through
power and keeping criminals under
control and controlling the borders and
stuff sort of sort of what you'd
classically
imagine in your
sexist mind to be a male
characteristics and the
democrats seem to be very female
dominated in a sense that
correct me if i'm wrong but 100 of
democrat
policies
are favored by most women right
would that be true 100
of democrat policies would be favored by
most women
i think that's true
so they are they are really
becoming the representative of women
oh i said no
no well yeah i didn't i didn't say for
everybody of course i'm not saying that
they represent republican women i'm
saying that the majority more than 50
percent i think
50 percent of women are
in favor of basically everything the
democrats want i think or something like
that
all right um
so the biden department of interior
announced
they're going to start uh again they're
going to resume the sale of oil and gas
leases on fed federal land
which is something that of course trump
did and trump was right about so just
added to the trump was right and biden
has to of course reverse policy
probably will do the same on the border
at some point but the the number of
times trump was right
which again does not forgive anything
that you don't like
about what he did but it's really
shocking how many things he was just
unambiguously right about and it's
obvious now
um
fox news asked a bunch of people about
what states were doing the best in the
worst
during covet
and
people thought that florida and
california were the two states that did
the best in terms of managing covet
do you do you notice anything weird
about that
the two best states according to who fox
news talked to i don't know how
scientific it was didn't sound like it
was too scientific
but
those are the two best
now that's according i think to largely
the people who lived in those states and
had familiarity with them
but yes they handled them completely
differently
and neither of them really were toward
the the top of the
you know saved people's lives list they
just were sort of in the middle of the
pack but they handled everything
differently
i i take you back to my weirdest
prediction at the beginning of the
pandemic
that you wouldn't be able to tell who
did a good job
how many of you thought that was even
possible
that at the end of it you wouldn't know
who was a good leader
or at least we wouldn't agree everybody
thinks they know but we wouldn't agree
i guess the point should have been we
wouldn't agree
not that you don't think you know
because i know a lot of you are going to
say oh desantis did the better job but i
think it has more to do with what you
valued
in california people wanted to protect
the weak
and so they said california did the best
in florida people were leaning toward
hey let us just live our life
and they got what they wanted and
so actually i think it is completely
rational
that california and florida were the
best at handling it
handling it completely differently
that actually does make sense because
the californians wanted it handled a
certain way on average i didn't you know
i was i would be a outlier in that
opinion and the floridians wanted it
handled a certain way and they got what
they wanted
so it is sort of an example of the
system working
right
the systems elected mayors that gave
them what they wanted or i'm governors i
mean they gave them what they wanted and
when it was done they said yeah i kind
of got what i wanted there
i don't think you could complain about
that you know that's that's one of the
big wins i think out of the whole thing
that the beauty of our system with the
different states
is that you can you can micromanage
the preferences
and that's sort of what happened
you know i i think that's just all good
news all right that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the completion of my
prepared comments
i think you'll agree this is one of the
most
stimulating entertaining and really just
gives you a tingle it's better than asmr
it's better than
most of the pharmaceutical drugs
that you can get
under the counter or under
and now that you're all
vibrating and let's say higher energy
and you're probably feeling amazing
and you're thinking yourself was this
the best show i ever saw
i've ever seen in my entire life
well we can't answer that question but
we can have one final sip
to set you on your day
now don't get used to this there won't
always be a closing sip
so savor it
savor it
savor it go
yeah that's pretty good
now before i go i'd like to solve the
homeless problem in california if i may
and
i don't know why
nobody has already suggested this
correct me if i'm wrong on these
assumptions
number one
the homeless in california at least
prefer to be outdoors
because if they're indoors in any way
they're going to be limited in their
drug use and they don't want to be
they'd rather be outdoors but nobody
wants to be outdoors and have it
dangerous and and you know unhealthy etc
what if
we took a bunch of public land
and said
this is a campground for the homeless
and the homeless will help you get going
we'll help you get going but you need to
form your own government
and management
and
and go wild if it gets too out of line
you know if it let's say if it differs
with you know state laws or local laws
then you can't do that
but in terms of just managing having a
mayor's or something like that why not
let them live the life they want to live
why not
these are people who who tell you
exactly what they want
and it's not much
they tell you exactly what they want and
it's not much
they want to be left alone
they want to live outdoors
and they would like to be safe and you
know maybe have some
services available
but i feel like you can if you were
close enough to say a hospital
and
you know there wasn't a risk that they
would burn down the forest that's a big
risk so you'd have to manage that
but i i feel like
instead of putting them indoors and
having them not like it and you're
wasting all this real estate for people
who don't want to be there anyway
is there any reason they can't just form
their own civilization and take care of
each other
has anybody tried it
now remember
the the key is not whether you think
it's a great idea that's not the key
the key is whether you could test it
on a small scale
now michael schellenberger is running
for
governor as an independent he's done the
best thinking and the most research and
has the most
clean and i think probably practical
suggestion for how to do this and he
would suggest
among other things
that the addicts are not the ones who
should decide whether they should be
free to do what they want because once
you're an addict you do lose the ability
to make good judgment
and if you care about them there's sort
of only one way to give them a chance
which is to take away their rights
just long enough that they can
be part of the decision-making process
again you know they can be you know
clean enough
that they can at least lean into
you know their own benefit if they want
to if they can right
so you could you could debate that i
think honest people could debate should
you go hard well let's say tough love
should you use tough love on the addicts
and the homeless or should you let them
live their best life
i think some of them are going to be
completely immune to tough love would
you agree
so maybe there's just a group of
hardcores
they just want to live their life the
way they want and if they die at 50 they
died happy and it was their best shot
because they didn't want to lift to 75
hating every day
so
it's a free country
maybe they can be accommodated you know
everybody's different
so i just put that out there is there
any kind of model that you could test
small and if it doesn't work you just
stop doing it
right
that's it
try it with i don't know
50 people
take 50 people you know really control
it monitor you don't walk away like
don't dump them in the forest and walk
away you give them some kind of support
make sure they had you know some kind of
supply chain you'd make sure that they
have the basics but
just try it
try it with 50 people see what happens
somebody said sweden did it
yeah
all right anyway i won't i won't tell
you i think it's a good idea i'll just
tell you it's easy to test and therefore
maybe we should and that's it for today
i'll talk to you tomorrow
