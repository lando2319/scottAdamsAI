best book in the world according to
everybody book that'll change your life
according to
everybody let's find those locals
people so I can see their comments
all right locals I can see you now you
can see the rest of you
[Music]
too good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
pretty sure you've never had a better
time but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny smooth
human brains all you need is a cuper mug
or glass of tanker chel or sign Canen
suar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unpleasure
unparallel pleasure of the do of being
here the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go extra
good extra
good
well so uh what happens when Ai and
security cameras get
combined cuz you know that's going to
happen um I'm sure it's happening
somewhere already there was a story
about some cameras in a Subway that were
reading people's emotions and trying to
decide if you're a bicycle thief and all
that but I have a real world uh event
that happened in my neighborhood so two
days ago uh one of the neighbors saw
what she thought was a mountain lion and
in the
backyard and this is like right in my
neighborhood a mountain line so we
weren't entirely sure if the picture was
clear is it really a mountain lion or
you know whatever so I take the photo uh
because we're all connected by a
WhatsApp group so I take the photo I
feed it up to chat GPT and they say hey
this animal was found what is it and
what you know how afraid should I be
chat gbt I identifies it immediately it
says oh it's a Puma mountain
lion it tells you what to do to stay
safe you know look big don't run away
because they have an instinct to chase a
whole bunch of stuff like that and I
thought how hard would it
be for the security cam itself to have
done that you know why why didn't the
security cam spot a mountain lion in our
backyard and send us a message on
WhatsApp saying hey everybody the
security camera just picked up a
mountain lion in the backyard so
everybody watch out now that's what
security is going to look like and and
it should also identify who you are and
open the door for you if you're
okay in
uh in my Incredible Book God's
debris um in the short story at the end
people don't have keys or locked doors
because you're decides who comes in and
doesn't so you just walk up to the door
and announce yourself to the AI and it
either opens or it doesn't so you don't
need keys anymore in the future that's
certainly where things are
going all right the xplatform Apparently
is going to have Micro payments soon or
just payments and uh we don't know when
that will come but it looks like it's
coming really fast it'll be in the
United States first also Elon Musk is
revealing that starling
has a new portable station so it's about
the size of a laptop so you could take
with you your starc and you can set up
in like a couple minutes you just prop
it up and hit a few buttons and you're
you're online I guess it can stream four
4K movies at the same time that's pretty
serious and some people are saying that
they might get it just says their
backup that's not the worst
idea but I was thinking if I have that
thing then I can just take my show
anywhere I want it right where when I
travel sometimes you get that crappy
Hotel Wi-Fi doesn't really work
so maybe I should travel more and take
that with me we'll wait to see when
that's on the market Chuck Schumer is
getting uh some humorous criticism for
posing for a Father's Day picture in
which he was clearly only pretending to
be the one doing the
grilling uh and the way you can tell
he's pretending is had a bunch of uh
uncooked patties sitting on the grill
and one of the uncooked patties had
cheese on
it who puts cheese on an uncooked
hamburger nobody nobody it's funny as
soon as I saw the picture I said to
myself I don't think he's doing the
grilling I just feel like Schumer is not
the one if there's like a big Gathering
what is the odds he's doing the grilling
I it was just so fake apparently he just
took the picture down and said ah you
got
me you know those are the situations
where I would love him just to tell the
truth say I I was just a stage picture
I'm an idiot and I would then I would
like him then you know then I would say
oh you know just a a human kind of a
thing no big
deal but uh I'd love him to be a little
more you know like a regular
person well Harry Anon the pollster guy
from CNN uh is becoming rapidly becoming
my favorite uh news related person
because he goes on CNN and he gets
really excited about how Trump is doing
well in the
polls and and since he's their own guy
they can't not invite him
anymore he's just he's just dancing on
Biden's grave with the poll numbers and
and he's enjoying himself way too much
you know he doesn't he's not calling a
favorite it's just he's way too excited
that poll that Trump looks like he's
going to have historic poll numbers with
black voters so that's what he was
talking about today and uh he he noted
that that when they drill down well
first of all the Trump's support among
black Americans went from 7% in the last
election to now
21% but he drilled down into the details
and I thought to myself ah finally we're
going to find out what's the male female
difference because I think it's mostly
meant but instead of male female he
looked at
age so apparently if you're over 50 um
you know you're more likely to support
Biden uh but even that's even that's
going down uh but if you're under 50 uh
his
supports um just dropped to practically
nothing yeah I'm exaggerating but his
support for under 50 is like in the in
the tank among black
Americans but they never mention gender
again do you think that black
Americans um under 50 are the main thing
that's happening and it's just age
related or do you think it's
men I think it might be both because
when you see the you know the street
interviews uh whether there whether the
interviewer is talking to a black
American man or woman
they're getting the same answer that
they like Trump this
time so it could be that I'm wrong that
the movement of men it might be more of
a general thing but not
necessarily especially in the black
community it might be just everybody
young so I don't know I would still bet
there's a bigger effect from males but
it doesn't seem like it
anecdotally uh CNN did the most
embarrassing thing I've ever seen a
network do since the hunter laptop story
and and that mess but they did this big
segment about how the people who support
Trump uh erroneously think America is
not a democracy and rather make some
strange claim that it's a republic
instead you know like the Constitution
says that it's
a constitutional federal
republic and CN then the news program
actually made a whole a whole
show trying to show that Republicans
don't know that we're really a
democracy and they showed uh videos of
past presidents referring to America as
a democracy to prove their point that
we're a democracy and always have
been and then they said they speculated
as to why these dumb Republicans keep
calling it a republic and do you know
what their theory is they had a guest on
who had a hypothesis why is it the
Republicans keep calling it a
republic it's because they don't like
democracies that's CNN's
take that the reason that Republicans
correctly call us a
republic is not because they're well
informed which would seem obviously the
case no it's rather part of their
strategy to to show that democracy is
unwelcome and really it should be some
other kind of a you know Trump dictator
situation that we might call a
Republic now that is so batshit crazy
 stupid that I don't even know
what to say about it you know every
every right leading pundit waited
already and did all the good jokes
but there were a number of people on CNN
who were not not aware that we're not a
democracy and we're never meant to be
one because that's one vote for
everybody and that's just
chaos I my mind is just
boggled and I'm going to remind you of
the game that I've been playing this
year that you could not play in other
years in other years you couldn't play
this game because you could argue that
well these are just two separate
opinions maybe they have different
information you know and different
preferences and stuff so there's a
reason people have two different
opinions but this year because Biden is
not even a viable human being much less
a a president there's no real doubt
about what's going on this year in the
past you can make an argument well you
know maybe they mean what they're saying
it's possible they just mean it and you
know it's just a different opinion from
mine but not
now not now so now you get to play the
game I call uh stupid lying or
TDS you take something that somebody
who's a Biden supporter says and you say
all right that's clearly ridiculous but
why are they saying it is it because
they're stupid is it because they're
lying or because they have TDS but and
then it gets
complicated because sometimes it's all
three so what would you say in this case
is CNN collectively because a lot of
people had to see this before got it in
the air are they collectively stupid and
they don't know that they're not living
in a democracy and was never intended to
be one are they lying and they know full
well what they're doing or do they have
TDS and it's just made them unable to
function well I I think this was a
combination of
stupid
because if they were smart they would
have known they would be mocked
mercilessly for
being so stupid so it must be genuine
stupidity but on top of it I think it's
you only get that stupid if you've got a
little
TDS so I don't think they're
lying they look like they meant what
they were saying so I'm going to say
mostly stupid but probably triggered by
a little TDS that you know made them
lose their ability to see
things and they said things like when
when they when the Trump supporters said
we're not a democracy it quote stop me
in my
tracks so one of the things that CNN
does is they try to sell things that
aren't true by their
attitude all right so let's say somebody
offered them a a bottle of water and
it's exactly what they wanted but the
person who offered it to him was let's
say a trump supporter so they couldn't
tell the story quite the way it happened
they would tell you the story but they
would add attitude to make it sound like
it's something else so instead of saying
you know I was really Thursday and this
nice Trump supporter at the rally
offered me one of his Waters that was
great thank you instead they'd
say I I was
dumbfounded I
was I don't even know what to say I I
don't even have talk about this uh I was
thirsty and
then somebody offered me like water like
do you think I'm
helpless I do you think I'm stupid do do
you think I can't figure out how to get
water like I I I I don't even know
what's wrong with these people have
you've seen it right they'll just take
the most ordinary thing and they'll try
to turn it into a thing by their their
reaction to
it now here's something I want you to
watch for watch how often the news is
about the news
more than ever and it's also about their
own reaction so they'll tell a story
that doesn't have much interest to it
like this one literally just made up
that there's some some kind of
controversy about whether we're
democracy or Republic no there isn't
there's no controversy there's no story
there at all they made a story entirely
about their own wrong reactions to
something
normal and then they put it on the air
all right um according to Reuters the
United States might be 15 years behind
China on nuclear power they're firing up
like 27 nuclear reactors uh and we have
planned
none none I guess we reopened a couple
or opened a couple but there's nothing
in the
pipeline now there are some smaller ones
that might have some you know tests
upcoming and stuff but nobody's just
building a nuclear power plant in the
United States do you know why well it's
political it's not tacnical and do you
know why
specifically the political problem here
that isn't in China apparently well it
turns out that women by a majority
pretty strong majority are against
nuclear energy and Men by a pretty
strong majority are in favor of
it now that
means that um the complete necessity of
having a robust nuclear energy program
for
survival for survival because we're
entering the AI robot era where the AI
and the robots are going to take all our
electricity and would have might have to
start a war just to get some more
electricity but we would be in good
shape if we had a good uh nuclear power
program so in the uh the right leaning
World there are a number of people uh
who are provocatively say that the
problem with the United States is that
we let women
vote now I of course dismiss that as you
know as as fun and provocative nobody's
really serious about that I don't take
it too seriously and I I disagree that
women I I disagree that women should not
be allowed to
vote however the data is on the side of
people who say they
shouldn't that's just the fact
that it looks like women voting has
destroyed the United States because I
don't think there's even a way to
recover from this if we're too far
behind on nuclear we will also be behind
on AI and certainly our economy will
suffer and therefore our military will
suffer this is actually an existential
end to the United States you know unless
we invent our way out of it which we're
pretty good at doing but
H that's a very bad person today in the
comments
um so yes uh I I do think everybody
needs to vote there's no way around
that uh but women you have to be aware
of the fact that you destroyed the
United States and I don't know what the
breakdown is of people who are in favor
of the open
borders but it's mostly Democrats and
the Democrats are a woman run program so
women seem to be singularly responsible
for opening the border which will
probably uh open up a wave of terrorism
like we've never
seen everybody expects that and also
responsible for destroying the only uh
the only important technology of the
future which is AI and Robotics because
we won't have enough energy to power it
now those are just facts what part did I
get wrong there's no hyperbole there
there iser th those are two things that
if you took women out of the mix they
would have gone the other way if men
alone had been in charge the Border
would be
secure and our nuclear program would be
humming along like crazy if men were in
charge now you could say well but men do
a bunch of other dumb things like attack
Ukraine well I don't know I think
Victoria Newland had a little something
to do with that um so I don't I you know
that's a special
case but no uh of course women should be
allowed to vote as all adult citizens
should be but you're going to have to
take you you're going to have to take
the score the score is you've largely
destroyed the
country Watergate has its H 50th
Anniversary ABC News has brought out the
two uh the two people you know the worst
in Watergate guy and then the other guy
um and here's the funny thing I used to
think that whole waterg story was
real that Nixon did some bad things you
know with the break in at the Watergate
and he tried to cover it up and then
good people got together from both both
sides it wasn't totally political and
ousted him and my current thinking is
that it was always a CIA op and I think
Nixon came to believe the same because a
lot of the people were CIA connected
and it looked like um Nixon was looking
to cut the CIA dramatically so Nixon was
anti
CIA and then they took him out so to me
it looks like the CIA just took out a
president and it's one of several times
they've done it it would be three that
we know of you know Kennedy
assassination Trump losing
mysteriously and Nixon so there could be
three of
them that were entirely that and I've
always wondered about Johnson not
running for
reelection I feel like somebody gave him
the talk but I don't know so I don't
believe anything about Watergate and
when I see ABC News trying to you
know kind of make them a thing again I
say to myself you know what maybe that
identifies what ABC News is about maybe
ABC News is more about covering up the
news than reporting the news you wonder
don't you wonder
that all right meanwhile uh actor and uh
hip-hop artist rapper 50 Cent you can
call him 50 Cent I would not criticize
you for that and apparently he's working
with h the Republican mayor of shreport
Louisiana to try to rebuild and
modernize the city and make it a hub of
American greatness they call it so he
wants to use move the headquarters for
his uh he's got a film and television
Studio create a bunch of jobs buying a
bunch of buildings there that he wants
to turn into special places he wants to
you know make creativity meet
opportunity and talent meets mentorship
the mentorship is pretty pretty smart
now this will be a really interesting
experiment because it's a a wealthy
celebrity black guy working with a
Republican mayor to do what probably
would just be a bunch of common sense
you know busy things that people would
like so I wish him the best
um and if it works maybe there's
something to copy and if it doesn't work
I'm going to say the cities are dead
forever I suppose that's harsh but I
don't expect cities to survive do you I
think it's just inevitable that living
in a city is just too much pain in the
ass too much crime too much everything
so I don't think that Reviving cities is
worth doing at all
I if I were 50 Cent I'd say hey
president Trump can you give me some of
that free land uh the federal land and
I'll build a new city there and I'll
I'll put my I'll put my industry there
and then you know could build the city
around it so it's already starting with
some
industry that's the way I'd go I'd go
blank blank land well Bill Maher on his
uh his auxiliary show uh what's that
called
uh what's Bill Mar oh Club random he had
Larry Wilmore on and Larry Wilmore if
you don't know him he's a comedian and
he's black which is important to both of
these points and he said uh quote uh I
have a healthy outlook on this I just
feel all white people is
problematic doesn't matter what party
you're
in then Bill said we do live in an era
now where lot of stuff can't happen in
Reverse I can't make that joke about you
and I don't want to now notice that bill
M called it a
joke I feel like he was kind of trying
to help out his friend do you think that
when Larry Wilmore said uh I have a
healthy Outlook I just feel all white
people are
problematic you think that was a
joke didn't sound like one I write jokes
for a living and I didn't recognize that
as any joke form I've ever
seen it sounded like it meant it to me
what do you what's your take wouldn't
you say you meant
it it would be a weird thing to say if
you didn't mean it you know unless there
was more to the act like if it was part
of an act I'd say oh he's going to
circle back around and you know soften
that after you've seen the whole thing
something like that but that sounded
like a conversational opinion it didn't
sound like any kind of a joke
and um and then uh Larry explained it
you know that it would be okay for him
to say that sort of stuff but not the
other way he says that's just the top
dog Underdog Dynamic Underdog is to make
fun of Top
Dog well that would be true if the top
dog could walk into any Corporation in
America and get a
job what what makes you the top dog if
you don't have free speech and you don't
have equal employment
what exactly is the top
dog if you have fewer economic
opportunities at least
jobwise and you don't have free speech
in the way that other people
do sort of a a weird definition of the
top dog versus the
underdog and uh then bill marah says
could you imagine if a white person said
that in Reverse it's not a good thing
and Larry said some of them do say that
fair
point um then there's a lot of
Oppression by proxy which was a more
interesting point but here's what I
say uh yes I agree with uh Larry's
comment that the underdog does get to
make fun of the overdog you know that
that's a pretty wellestablished
human thing right kind of in lots of
different scenarios that's just the way
it goes and you could love it or hate it
but it's sort of normal in human
behavior doesn't seem like the worst
thing in the world that The Underdogs
are mocking the overdogs as they see it
you could argue who's the underdog in
this case but it's a separate
argument but here's my
take I got cancelled for pointing out
that Larry Wilmore
exists I didn't get cancelled for my
opinion I get canceled for simply obs
obing that other people have an opinion
and that it was documented in one case
in a rasmason pole which had about a 9%
margin of error which would have changed
my opinion in either direction because
it it was a big effect and if it had
been off by 9% or 20% or 30% it would
still be the same point which is rasm
found an alarming percentage of people
who were black who said it wasn't okay
to be white
Larry Wilmore says I feel all white
people are problematic isn't that the
same
opinion now tell me if I'm if I'm just
being too generous to myself here is it
not true that I got cancelled for simply
observing that there's more than one
Larry Wilmore with the opinion that
white people are
problematic that's what I get canceled
for I didn't say I don't like black
people because that wouldn't be true I
black
people I didn't say I didn't say that
you should discriminate against
them I says you should get away from
anybody with this opinion I wouldn't
want Larry Wilmore as my neighbor would
you would you want Larry and Wilmore to
be your neighbor after he says white
people are
problematic I wouldn't the smartest
thing you could do is get as far the
 away from Larry Wilmore as you
can why would you have any contact with
them now if somebody's just a flat out
racist against
you don't have contact I say the same
thing it's the same advice for black
Americans if you're looking for a new
town to move to and one of them is a
headquarters of the
KKK it would be a bad idea to say well
but most of the people are
nice that'd be a bad strategy you should
if you're black don't move into a town
that has an active KKK chapter in it
that won't work out you should get the
 away from the KKK and when it comes
to what's safe there are no rules if
you're doing your own safety there's no
law against any decision you make you
know within the existing
law so yes you can stay away from people
who uh State a preference that they
don't like you for whatever
reason anyway this is funny New York
governor hokel
uh and New York city mayor Adams they
both want to ban masks in public places
so they don't want you to wear a mask on
the subway and they don't want you to
wear a mask for a protest because
they've just discovered that people
wearing masks in that situation might
cause trouble because they can't be
spotted how how long did it take them to
figure that
out well everybody in the world knew
this the that they're just figuring out
that the masks might be bad for for
Crime yeah yeah
certainly uh Greg Abbott governor of uh
Texas he's sounding the alarm they say
uh there was some Houston voter fraud
got caught and Abbott says voter fraud
is real because a judge has ordered a
new election in Harris County so400
votes were illegally cast and they got
caught the part of the story that I'm
most curious about is part I didn't see
which is how' they catch
them that the how do you catch them
seems like the important part of the
story right because if it turns out they
only caught them by
luck or or a or a
whistleblower wouldn't that suggest that
people could cheat and get away with it
fairly
easily but if the system is set up such
that that level of cheating 1,400 votes
by way would be a lot of votes I think
whoever won only won by about 500 so it
was the margin the difference between
winning and
losing but don't you want to know if the
normal election process cut that
irregularity isn't that the big question
the big question is oh we're so well
organized that if somebody does cheat we
might catch it after the fact but in
time to correct
it I I feel like the most important part
of the story isn't in the headline so
maybe if you dig down a little deeper
somebody fill me in how do they catch
that
person anyway
um The Washington Post is uh doing
poorly with their new leadership I guess
the staff is rebelling because the new
leadership did some things in the past
that people don't love in his prior jobs
and but I think they're just it's more
that he's too right leaning he's more
more like little bit of center right I
think and they don't like that but
Nicholas Kristoff who writes for the New
York
Times said this in a post he said the
Washington Post is a great great great
paper and it's greatness now if you
keeping track Nicholas Kristoff works
for the New York Times as a writer now
New York Times gets the finest writers
because they have you know best
reputation so the finest writer has used
were great four times in the sentence so
far I just need to point that out I just
need to point that out great great great
paper and this greatness pushes the rest
of us in the media world to do a better
job
really you know why universe is the
Washington Post a great publication
that's pushing everybody to
Excellence I thought everybody knew it
was just a garbage publication that
that's just a propaganda vehicle I
thought that was widely
understood but really this is this
real so here here we're going to play um
stupid lying or
TDs is Nicholas
Kristoff stupid lying or does he have
TDS doesn't look like TDS because it's
not related to Trump in
anyway is he stupid
that seems
unlikely although he did use the word
great four times in one
sentence sort of argues against that
point but no he's he's a professional
writer who's done well enough that you
would intu it that his IQ is high so I
don't think he's
stupid um that would leave
lying do you think he really thinks the
Washington Post is a great great paper
or does he think it's great great for
Democrats I'm going to go with lying on
this one now when I play this game
remember I don't know the real answer
I'm just saying my best answer is he's
not stupid it doesn't seem related to
TDs because that's not even in the topic
Trump isn't it looks like he's just
lying now do you have another another
hypothesis if you do I'd be
interested anyway
um BBC says more people are turning away
from the news so the number of people
who even follow the news
uh um let's see it
was yeah it's like 39% are turning away
from the news when it was only 29% in
2017 so far more people are just
ignoring the news because it's depr it's
depressing and Relentless and boring now
the BBC is reporting
this do you know who's really the worst
people to report on why people aren't
watching the
news it's the
news they are the least capable to tell
you that story because if they knew what
they were doing that caused people not
to watch it they'd probably do something
different so they're the only ones who
don't know what's going on let me tell
you what's going on we can all tell it's
not
real we can all tell it's not real
everybody knows it's not real but you
know we we still like to agree with the
stories that agree with us but on some
level we know it's not real and I don't
think we always knew that so that's new
the other thing is there you know
there's social media there more options
blah blah blah and people don't
necessarily like this long form and
comes on at 7 o'clock at night I mean
there are a whole bunch of reasons why
the news would the traditional news
would decrease but here's what they
should have
said they should have said that the
consumption of news on the xplatform is
at an all-time high I don't know that to
be true but I'll bet it's true don't you
think if you say people aren't watching
the regular news you should mention that
they've probably done what I did I watch
very little regular news but I'm on
social media all the time which is
summarizes the other news reports Etc so
this is probably another one of those
poorly measured and the wrong people are
reporting a situation
all right um the Washington examiner has
an
exclusive that the state depart State
Department got subed for failing to turn
over records on programs that uh
Republicans are
saying uh created censorship by proxy
and revenue interference so in other
words the the claim is that the
government worked with private companies
the social media platforms and and maybe
the things in order to basically
p uh push
censorship censorship means changing
interfering with elections
basically mostly it's interfering with
elections even if that's doesn't look
like it every day the effect is
that
anyway so we'll see how that turns out
we do see that some of the uh that
censorship uh
stuff
was uh dismantled but I suspect it just
goes and hides in other Corners I can't
imagine that the Democrats will stop
using the government to
censor um I just think they'll keep
doing it but more cleverly or they'll or
they'll censor Ai and that's all they'll
need to do in the future something like
that but I don't think any of that is
going
away um according to rasmuson 62% of
Voters approve of the prison sentence
for
banon now that's not too surprising
because um that would be of course
pretty much all the Democrats because
it's Bannon but that would still give
you a bunch of Republicans who said you
know what you know maybe we like Bannon
but the law is the law I don't hate
that you know I I think Bannon should
not be uh jailed over the
things uh but on the other hand there
was a clear law and there was a clear
violation of the law and if other people
went to jail for
it I guess you got to support the rule
of law but this one is so hinky that um
I'm not in favor of jailing
banon all right there's a uh fun story
on social media I'm going to call it a
recreational belief that Joe Biden has a
body
double and that wall Apes is reporting
this and uh so there have been images of
Biden going around that you know looks
like it's a body double with a mask I
don't believe that's true but the but
it's an interesting recreational belief
um I think he looks different because he
looks different during the day I think
sometimes his dementia face is more
pronounced than others I think when he's
tired his face looks empty and when he's
maybe pumped up with some stimulants he
looks different he smiles differently I
I think camera angles is some of it you
know I think probably it's just a whole
bunch of people look different in
different scenarios
probably but then there's also a claim
that he's changed his signature after 30
years and the question was you know who
changes their signature after 30 years I
did I changed mine how many of you have
the same signature from 30 years
ago here here's what happened to me
let's see if it happened to any of you I
used to sign sign by name you know in
cursive uh and I would hit every hit
every
letter and I'd say ah nobody can copy
this and then I started signing credit
cards and stuff for $6
purchases you remember that you don't
have to sign for the little purchases
anymore but for a long time you had to
sign for everything and I knew that my
signature made no difference to anything
or anybody
so I did what most of you do I just go
it's not my signature it's just like a
it's just like a scribble with one line
and nobody ever questions it because
nobody cares it's not important that you
actually signed it so for years I've had
two
signatures one if it's like a if I'm
signing up for a new bank or something
I'll give my actual signature but 95% of
what I sign is just a scribble it's not
even trying to have any letters in it so
I don't think think it's that unusual
for somebody elderly to have a different
signature because their hand Works
differently in my case also have a hand
issue right
now so I modify my signature a little
all right I don't think he's a body
double but it's fun to think about
it um Chanel Ryan of uh oan had an
interesting report about the Biden crime
family if I could call it that and
Rosemont senica now you heard that
Hunter Biden was Partners in called
Rosemont Sena what you might not know I
didn't know it until today with Chanel
Ryan's reporting that um roseon senica
had a bunch of sub
subsidiaries also the start with
Rosemont senica so it's like Rosemont
senica X Rosemont senica blah blah so a
bunch of them now why would you have so
many entities no good
reason but here's the allegation
the allegation is that Hunter Biden was
brought into Roseman Sena which had been
established before he got there I think
there was a Carrie son-in-law and uh and
the guy who became Hunter's partner
there and the allegation is that Hunter
came in to help them launder money from
Russian
oligarchs so the idea was that the
Russian oligarchs wanted to figure out
some kind of shady business where their
money that's hard to get out of Russia
could get into these entities and then
the entities would launder it basically
so that they'd have access to it outside
of Russia that's my understanding now um
then the further allegation is that they
sold rosemund
Sena to somebody rich in
China so I don't think I have all the
details but it looks like this it was
always a money operating money
laundering
operation and uh Hunter was the primary
person who could make that happen and
also do some connections there were two
parts one was to get the money out and
the other was to create Connections in
America so hondre could do both yeah he
could get money out and he could form
connections for them so the if I
understand it correctly and I'm not
really sure I do I think the allegation
is this
that the the oligarch money would flow
into Rosemont
Sena and that would be kind of Trapped
because it'd be too obvious if he just
then took that money and laundered it so
instead they sold the whole
company presumably including the funds
in it in other words they would sell the
bank accounts and everything else to a
Chinese
entity the Chinese would pay for the I
guess the name on the company but also
they'd pay for its
cash which makes it look like oh we just
got some money for selling a
company and I think that was the money
laundering scheme although I feel like
I'm missing something because it doesn't
seem like that could have worked but
there's probably more details to it but
something in that General category of
moving money to help oligarchs and then
using some rich person in China to
execute the of the
scheme if any of that's
true the Scandal is way bigger than you
thought if any of that's true I would
say I still wait on that one to see if
there's any further
information all right speaking of uh
lying stupid or TDS I saw
um venture capitalist that you've been
hearing about lately sha Maguire who
quite prom L and got a lot of news for
it decided to stop backing Biden and
become a trump supporter because
apparently he's not crazy but here's the
story so keep in mind he's a physics
PhD um venture capitalist rich guy so
really really
smart and concerned enough about
politics that he's making a he's making
waves so he pays attention to politics
and he is way smarter than than all of
us yesterday he found out for the first
time that the fine people hoax was a
hoax and that what Trump really did was
disavow the
neo-nazis and he posted it he said he
just found it because he only for the
first time saw the full video and he
went what the I just found out that
whole thing wasn't true and all you had
to do is watch the video to know there
were no tricks you just had to watch it
that's it you just had to watch the
whole video instead of the clip that
they always show and Bill Amman weighed
in famous you know um F Financial guy
Bill Amman to say that he too thought
the fine people hoax was true until um
before Sean McGuire found out he had
also found out it wasn't
true so now those are two of the
smartest people who had ever supported
Democrats they had no idea the fine
people hoax was made
up now I have one question for Shan
Maguire which is did you really move
your support to Trump while thinking he
he had complimented
neo-nazis you've got a little more
explaining to do if I really thought
that Trump had had praised neo-nazis I
wouldn't be supporting
him so it was a little explaining to to
be done there you know he probably had a
he probably had a sense that it was
exaggerated I'll give him that
credit so in this case were Shan Maguire
and Bill Amman lying stupid or did they
have
TDS well in this case neither or
none I would say in this case they were
locked in The Silo and were unaware that
they were not seeing actual news they're
actually discovering for the first time
time that the thing they thought was
news was never that it was always
propaganda it was designed that way it
was executed that way and it was never
meant to be real news now it's the
finding out it was never meant to be
real news that's the the painful part
for your brain if you thought well
here's some anomaly but they're trying
hard otherwise no they're
not no they're not they are not trying
to be real news when it comes to Trump
they're not trying at
all so I guess that was a little wakeup
call for
them and then meanwhile uh Mark cubin uh
weighs in on
uh let's see he was he was weighing in
on Pierce Morgan and Bill akman talking
about how old uh Biden is and so Mark
cubin says in the post he goes you guys
both Pierce Morgan and Bill akman are so
consumed with pandering to your Twitter
follow followers you have lost all
objectivity I'll let you both in on a
secret and then he writes in all caps
both candidates are old very old he goes
back to regular text he says they both
are going to have senior moments
misremember forget things and have
physical
frailties uh I'll tell you a Noto secret
secret one is great as sound bites but
also thinks in sound bites the other is
awful as sound bites but thinks in
complete sentences voters will decide
which we
prefer what do you make of
that is
that
stupid TDS or lying or something else or
something else what's your take on
that well uh I reposted it with my own
comment and I said I hope this is
performance
art and then I saw El musk
uh kind gave a laughing emoji to my
comment so he was he was enjoying me uh
saying that about Mar Cuban because if
you didn't know Elon and Cuban have
gotten into it a little bit publicly
so I would like to uh inject one other
possibility he might have been
drunk
because I can't tell you how many times
I get comments that are sort of not just
disagreeing with me but sort of
nonsensical and and I just reply back uh
have you been day drinking and almost
always that stops the comments because
it turns out I think that is the reason
for a lot of what you think are trolls
are literally just angry drunks who know
that nobody can punch them because
they're
online so when I look at this and I see
that Cubans trying to equate the their
performance he couldn't possibly believe
that could
he who in the world looks at Biden says
yeah he I think he's pretty good behind
closed
doors I I don't think anybody smart has
that opinion do they but he's
smart is it
TDS well there's certainly something
going on there but maybe it's personal
more than TDS I don't know but this
one's kind of a mystery but I think I'm
going to go with he may have uh he may
have posted while he was
drunk that's my best guess because I'm
not even going to talk about whether
it's a good I you know good a good point
of view or anything it just looks drunk
it's not even something I'd agree or
disagree with so I hope not but might
be of course we're being warn there's
going to be another bird flu and Alex
Jones warned you he told you this was
coming the former of the CDC says
there'll be human deaths coming with
this bird
flu well okay all right uh there's a
story about uh some democrat running for
commissioner in Fort Bend County in
Texas and he got uh he was arrested and
charged for faking his own racist hate
mail he allegedly created uh fake fake
accounts to make racist comments about
himself
uh it looks like an Indian guy Terell
Patel Terell Patel well that's a cool
name Terell Patel oh my God that's a
great name Terell Patel I could say that
all day long anyway the demand for
racism has once again exceeded the
supply so he had had his own supply of
racism against
himself uh how many of you saw the video
of Biden at a fundraiser with Obama and
some Hollywood types and it looked again
like Biden was frozen or confused on
stage and uh toward the end when they
had to leave the stage uh Obama sort of
grabbed him by the hand to sort of lead
him off like he wouldn't know that he's
supposed to lead now people have said
damn it Biden all you had to do was just
get his attention you know you didn't
have to take his hand like he's a you
know like he's a feeble old guy
to which I say I'm not so sure he might
have had to take his hand because I
don't know if even the lights were on at
that point it it might be that talking
to him would have helped as in all we're
going to Exit Stage right I I think he
just would have looked at him with those
big dumb eyes like uh so I I think
Obama's instincts might have been better
than you think because he's been you
know he had been spending time with him
so he knew exactly what by mental state
was at that moment and if he decided
that the best way to deal with this is
to hold his hand to take him off which
is what he
did um I think Obama knows the the score
here but of course the uh the the
humorous Democrats are claiming that uh
there was nothing wrong he wasn't Frozen
uh Obama just overplayed it and uh
everything was fine there's nothing to
see here and by the way in Normandy by
the I think I told you this the Normandy
video where it looked like Biden was
going to wander away from the other
leaders I said he's not wandering away
he's interacting with somebody else
who's off screen and now that's that's
what was happening he was interacting
with the parachute guy so it didn't look
good I'm not defending it I'm just
saying it might not been as bad as you
thought he wasn't wandering
off um and MSNBC host uh Alex
Wagner uh a woman a woman named Alex uh
worries that the uh the debate will be
unfair here's why she worries that the
debate will be unfair you ready for this
now we're going to
play uh stupid lying or TDS all right so
here is why uh Alex Wagner on MSNBC
thinks the debate won't be fair because
she says the bar for Biden is so much
higher Trump's bar is literally is he
alive is he standing are the words
coming
out I didn't get the names
confused I didn't get the names confused
she's saying that the bar for Biden is
higher and the the bar for Trump is
lower because all Trump has to do is be
alive and stand there and
speak what's going on
here do they literally just take
everything that's true and just reverse
it but they but I think they also add
the
attitude it's the attitude that that
sells it I don't know I think
uh do they think that I can't even tell
if it's stupid because they might be
cleverly thinking the audience is stupid
which would not be stupid it would be
evil but but
um there's clearly some TDS involved but
I don't think that's all it's kind of a
mystery isn't it see now do you get my
point yet that in a normal
election you have to have some humility
about what's true because you always
think your side is right but in the real
world you know sometimes your side's not
right sometimes there's some extra
information that would change your mind
you know in the real world things are a
little gray but Biden has totally
clarified the
situation and if you could come on TV
and with a straight face say reality is
the opposite of what You
observe what is
that what is
that is it
lying is it
stupid is it just
TDS I'm going to I'm going to rank this
one
TDS CU I think nobody is that stupid and
I think
uh it it's so obviously not true that
even lying doesn't make sense it looks
like something that you didn't know that
everybody else knows is not true so I'm
going to say TDS it looks like mental
illness to
me on that one all right so PJ media is
reporting that uh we have some details
about the upcoming debate June 27th so
Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will be
moderating so here are the things we
know two commercial breaks instead of
one we don't know about bathroom breaks
but that may have something to do with
the age of at least one of the people um
the mics will be muted when it's not the
candidates turn that feels fair you know
obviously that's a pro Biden anti-trump
rule but I don't really like it when
somebody wins the debate by talking over
the other people so fair enough um both
candidates uh going to be at a Podium
and their Podium will be determined by
coin flip here's the interesting one no
audience will be
present why do you think no audience
will be
present well so I have a lot of
experience talking in front of large
groups and I also have uh experience
talking to a
camera it's so
different if you're Trump talking to an
audience
is
home that's where he would be most
comfortable even if half of them were
booing That's Just Energy Trump is an
energy
monster he plays to the audience so if
you take the audience away you've
neutralized 25% of Trump's power you
know he would have to rely on complete
performance at that point instead of the
energy that he gets from an audience um
so I would say that's an entirely Pro
Biden
situation but not enough that will
probably make a
difference uh there won't be any opening
statements that's good those are waste
of time um and they're going to enforce
the time limits blah blah blah and
there'll be a spin room of course Gavin
Newsome will be available for Biden and
Trump has yet to choose anyone to
represent him in the oh who is Trump
going to choose to represent him in the
Press
afterwards what's your
guess well I'm going to take a
guess it's either
vake because that would be a smart
play uh or JD
Vance because that would be a smart
play and it might be signaling who the
VP choice will be or alternately it
could be an audition for the vice
president it would be really good
audition to see if you can back the
president even if he made a few mistakes
because one of the things they're going
to say is uh Trump said that when the
wind stops blowing your TV won't
work and then you know the if it's JD
Vance or vake they're not going to be
able to agree that your TV goes off I'm
just using a stupid example so if Trump
departs from the fact Checker's
Lane uh it's embarrassing to defend it
but defend it you must you know if
you're going to be vice president you
better be able to handle that if the
vice president pick can't handle the
question like why did Trump say this
when our fact Checkers say that then
that's not the right choice V can do it
in a sleep JD Vance can do it in his
sleep they're really strong so it could
be that Trump
maybe you know will pick somebody else
for VP but and you go with his a team
for the immediate response after and the
a team is Vance and V I think I think
that's pretty
clear all right um RNC co-chair Laura
Trump bringing the fire as as you know
she's recruiting 10 100,000 pole
Watchers and 500 lawyers that's the goal
anyway and she said at the uh a recent
event she said uh this is the year we do
it she was talking at Turning Point
USA's convention uh they said uh we're
also sending a loud and clear message
out there to anyone who thinks about
cheating in an election we will find you
we will track you down and we will
prosecute you to the full extent of the
law any
questions remember I told you that
you're going to be really happy that
Lara Trump has this
job this is one of the best hires in the
Trump uh you know annals of
History she has the good
and do you see what she's doing here
that's not just talk she's freezing out
the
cheaters she's not just saying we're
going to come get you she's saying don't
try don't try is what we
needed that's what we needed we needed
it don't try we're going to have 100,000
people plus 500 lawyers putting your ass
in
jail suppose you're a Democrat cheater
and you went from business as usual
nobody's going to catch me to Lara Trump
just formed an army to catch your ass
which one which one gives you a little
pause I I think she's coming hard and uh
the the threat is as good as the reality
so Laura being
smart and you know the whole family
knows persuasion it seems she's going
exactly EX exactly with the right
message we will find you we will
prosecute you if you try don't try I
love that my God that's so
good um and then might actually find
people cheating so here's my prediction
for the election goes like this I
believe that with that many poll
Watchers there will be Untold number of
reports of
irregularities so some of those reports
will not be valid they might be somebody
saw something that wasn't quite what
they thought they
saw some percentage of them will be
valid but maybe could be smaller stuff
some of them might be big claims that
would take too long to adjudicate or no
no court has you know the Authority or
something like that so there's going to
be a whole bunch of claims only because
there are 100,000 people now I've told
you a million times if somebody
takes a job as a Ghost Hunter and you
hire them to look for ghost in your
house oh they'll find
some yeah if you're being paid to find
something you'll always find it if
you're being paid to uh find the racist
you'll find some plenty of them you know
even if they're not
there so there there will be plenty and
plenty of claims but here's my
provocative prediction there will be so
claims and not enough time to validate
them that the uh Congress will not be
able to certify the election and when I
say not able I mean that the country
will be in such an uproar that they know
if they certify the election it's just
going to be riots in the street because
people won't trust the
outcome so what would happen if they
can't certify the election my
understanding is then it goes to a
second process they don't hold the
election again they kick it to the house
the house then if I understand correctly
uh will get one vote per state and I
guess it
depends um you know who has which party
has uh their elected officials in those
States I forget which elected officials
but the each state gets one vote and if
it went the red blue way that the states
are Trump would
win so imagine if you
will a bunch of claims that make the
election certification
impossible followed by Trump winning in
an alternate
process what would what would uh Biden
do then well here's the problem Biden
would have months before the actual um
change over a power and in that time
he's still
president he could lock Trump
up for anything but I don't think that's
going to
happen but he could also pack the
Supreme Court and then have the Supreme
Court just give him the
election so the thing I worry about is
he's going to use those few months to
pack the
court because he doesn't you know that
would be a good time to do it if you're
going to be that evil so I'm going to
predict no outcome I think the election
will not be decided because there will
be so many claims of cheating whether
real or not there'll be so many claims
they can't certify it he'll get kicked
over the states that'll make it
worse and Biden will say this isn't you
know democracy has been subverted and so
the only way for me to save it is this
grotesque packing of the court that I
know nobody wants but this is an
emergency what do you think now there
are lots of ways it could go the odds of
me guessing it exactly correctly with
that many twists and turns is very low
so I'm not going to bet my life on that
prediction I'm just going to say that
the system design should get us to that
place remember I always say design is
Destiny the design of the system is a
100,000 new people who are ghost
Watchers looking for ghosts ghost
Watchers always find ghosts even if
they're not there how are they going to
adjudicate all the claims that are going
to come out of this thing there will be
hundreds maybe thousands
and they're not going to have time to
adjudicate any of that before the change
over of
power so what's Biden going to do the
Democrats will not accept anything that
looks like a trump Victory I think we
can be safe in saying
that and and it could be worse if the
polls are clearly Pro Trump and then he
doesn't win it's going to really look
like it was
cheating I don't think this I don't
think there's much chance at all that
this election will get certified
especially since we have that in our
mind that not certifying it is a thing
if there had never been a January
6 I don't think anybody would even think
about not certifying it it just wouldn't
be in our minds but that put it so
squarely in our minds that everybody's
going to think about it and if you can't
agree what happened you can't certify
it and I don't think that they'll do the
fake elector thing again because the
fake electors got arrested
nobody's going to be a fake elector in
the risk of being arrested so instead I
think they're going to kick it to the
kick it to the
house where there's a majority of states
that are
red and then what do you
do the the the Democrats would have to
do something
unprecedented or else give up power and
all of them are going to get fired and
jailed they that's what they'll think
they think they're going to go to jail
if they don't reverse that decision so
yes they would pack the courts and they
would come up with some case
and immediately give it to the court and
demand that the court act you know uh in
as an express lane for this because it's
so
important and then they'll just put Joe
Biden in
power howse how else could it go I mean
you you run it through your own mind and
say how could it not happen that
way there there's nothing about that
that that isn't obviously going to
happen except for the Supreme Court
packing that that is pretty radical but
but the part about there's no chance of
it getting
um certified by the Congress I feel
comfortable in that prediction I don't
think we have a system which can get us
to a result will
trust I also think that now that RFK Jr
has said let's get rid of the electronic
voting systems and Elon Musk has said
let's get get rid of those and I've said
can anybody explain why we have them no
six months in a row nobody can tell me a
reason why we have them in the first
place by the way there was an article
that tied the three of us together as
opponents of those
machines I think you're going to see
some other people break in that
direction and I think voting machines
may have a a limited lifespan at this
point but we'll see depends how powerful
the CIA is because I'm sure they want to
keep them it could be that you know it's
possible uh that the machines in the
United States have never been rigged in
any significant way but that we do rig
them in other countries and if we got
rid of them at home even if they were
never a problem it would be a big
problem overseas because then the other
countries would say wait a minute well
hold on you Americans said we need some
voting machines and you just got rid of
yours because you don't trust them why
are you saying we need voting machines
so it could be that they just can't live
without voting machines they just need
it
anyway uh we're hearing now that the
Pentagon ran a secret antiva campaign
against China so that uh you I guess
they didn't want the Philippines to be
too indebted to China for China giving
them vaccinations so they had a
different thing it was covac that was
their vaccination a lot of people said
it wasn't good um but were any of them
were any of the vaccinations good I
don't think so
um so just think about that the US
military was convincing Chinese citizens
not to get vaccinated while knowing it
could have saved their life or believing
it could save their
life did we really do
that
cuz you know I know that we always do
dirty tricks to each other and China is
sending fentol and maybe terrorists and
stuff but were we really doing that we
were we were killing their
citizens for public relations and by
killing them I mean if they were talk
manig getting the vaccination or Worse
did we talk people in the Philippines
out getting
vaccinations while also believing it
would save their life you know you could
argue whether that was
true if that if if that story is true
that's one of the filthiest things I've
seen our country do but it might be
true all right ladies and gentlemen that
concludes my prepared remarks I'm going
to go do some other stuff but not until
I talk to the locals people privately
the subscribers so goodbye to rumble and
YouTube and
X um but I know it takes you a minute so
I'm going to end this and go to talk
to the good Folks at
locals
