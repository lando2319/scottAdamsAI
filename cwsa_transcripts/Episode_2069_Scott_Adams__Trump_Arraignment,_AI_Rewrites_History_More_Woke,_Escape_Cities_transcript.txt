civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams today with better lighting
maybe a little too bright we'll fix that
later
but if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that have never
been known before and enjoyment to which
you can only imagine until now all you
need is a cupboard
so I lost my little cheat note of what I
say before the show but that's okay
because it's written on my mug
except
the first word is missing on my mug
I don't remember what it was
probably uh
Cupra mug or uh
flask
cover a Mugger a glass
a tanker cells or
Stein
I can't teach younger philosophy vessel
of any kind
yeah
when you lose it in the first second of
it live stream it will never come back
but let me tell you something about
presentations the first minute decides
how the entire thing goes like if the
first minute goes really well everything
goes well after that
but when it goes this way instead
there's not a chance that this will be
good
we're off to the wrong foot
but still we can have the simultaneous
Sip and we're going to try to recover
from here because do we quit no we do
not quit we push forward
go
I can't believe I picked the one mug out
of my my cupboard that had the missing
words
oh no
well how many of you uh watched the
Trump arraignment
we'll talk about that I'm going to do
some a few short stories before that as
people pour in they'll be pouring in to
get my comments on this
well the funniest thing that happened I
guess yesterday was that uh Twitter
labeled NPR State Affiliated media on
Twitter
so Twitter uh likes to tag any
propaganda sites from other countries so
if there's a Chinese state-affiliated
person they'll put that right in the bio
so you can't miss it
uh so something like you know RT Russia
Today
might you say have that little warning
well musk started putting that or
twittered it started putting that on NPR
state-affiliated media in other words
you're supposed to not believe their
news
Twitter actually has a permanent label
on NPR that it's not to be believed
uh
I about that
and then uh of course you got some
pushback and uh musk just
took the definition of State supported
media and published it and said that
looks about right
[Laughter]
now there was some pushback somebody
said that only two percent of NPR's
funding comes from the government
does that sound right to you
does it sound like only two percent of
their funding comes from the government
now that sounds like a lie doesn't it I
mean it's something I saw on Twitter but
it looked like somebody who knew what
they were talking about but it can't be
real could it if it were two percent I
probably would have gone to zero
that's my theory if it ever got down to
two percent
probably the public would have said
wouldn't it be better at zero I mean is
that two percent really making all the
difference wouldn't it be better for the
government just to be out of that
business
and that kind of feelings more than two
percent
oh somebody says 100 of the news
I don't know about that but that's a
claim I'm seeing there
well I just think it's hilarious it may
be a little uh overstated but not much
it makes me wonder
um why would NBC not be considered
state-affiliated media
it's not just because they're funded
right isn't it isn't NBC
the one that Glenn Greenwald always says
the CIA it basically controls them
or at least you know control some
stories that they they publish
wouldn't it be perfectly
um accurate for Twitter to call NBC a
state Affiliated media
or MSNBC I don't know thank you
well I guess you'd have to prove it so
that might be the problem
Babylon bee had as it often does the
best comment on everything
you know we keep talking about uh kids
being sexualized by all the
uh the trans related information and
events
and you know people are getting all
worked up oh those children those
children are getting sexualized and then
the Babylon B says we need to protect
our kids from inappropriate teaching on
sex say parents who let their kids have
a smartphone
oh oh
yeah uh oh yeah
yeah that's a that's a good point
now
the smartphone usually doesn't kick in
until what what's the common age today
11 or 12 that's when the kid gets a
smartphone
but the kids are being taught
stuff at age six right six and seven
so they're you know the Babylon B uh
I just saw a terrible meme The Babylon
bee isn't exactly accurate but it's in
terms of humor it's perfect
yeah you know we do just give away our
upbringing of our kids
all right you wanna here's the first AI
related story I've got a feeling all the
stories will be AI in the future
know you at least until I'm replaced by
AI I'll just be talking about it until
that's all it is
but uh one of the stories is
suppose you had an AI step parent
an AI step parent and you put that
personality into a kid's phone so the
kid couldn't get it get rid of it and
then the AI on the phone simply monitors
the kid without your knowledge
so in other words the the parents might
be unaware what the kid is looking at
but not the AI That's built into their
phone so the AI That's in the phone
would say when you put in that naughty
URL
the AI and the phone would say
um Billy I don't think that's good for
you
um would you like to see something on
Instagram instead
well think about it AI
tell me if I'm wrong could AI not tell
what was inappropriate content every
time
I think he could I think he could
identify inappropriate content every
time
so you wouldn't have to worry about
censoring your kid's phone you just put
the AI parent on there and the AI
virtual parent which is saying no Billy
Billy do not look at that website I'm
going to block that for you maybe you
should look at something about nutrition
instead
right and what about an AI that takes
over for the algorithm
do you think AI could game the
algorithms on behalf of the user so that
it would start giving them wholesome and
you know
affirming kinds of content
because if you can get the AI to select
things on your behalf it could game the
algorithm by selecting things when
you're not there
and then after it's selected enough
things while you're not there the
algorithm at the social media would be
trained to give you more of what your AI
had trained it to give you which would
be a whole bunch of positive things
Maybe
anyway but if you're worried about
censorship and phones I think AI is
going to be all of that
why wouldn't it be can you think of any
reason why it wouldn't go in that
direction
that's the most
valuable well I would say it might be
the most valuable application of AI
except for maybe figuring out how to do
Fusion or something I mean that would be
way up there if you could actually
program children to be more productive
happy citizens
because they're using their phone all
day anyway
wouldn't that be insanely valuable like
just incredibly valuable
something to think about
yeah we'll get to jump
of course we'll get the jump
of course
but first uh Thomas Massey had a tweet
today about something to scare you also
AI related of course
so the the chief Innovation officer at
the National Archives is talking about
using AI
to literally rewrite history
to make it more
woke
so in other words to get rid of what
they call the inherent bias in the
existing records now I do believe the
records have an existing bias no no
argument there
I'm sure history has a bias but are you
at all worried about AI rewriting human
history
does any of that scare you it scares
Thomas Massey and it scares the hell out
of me
so we're going to come into some strange
times which is we know our history is
fake right
got to do you know here's a question I
have how many books will AI be able to
consume
because AI is only going to have access
to what it has legal access to and what
is digitized
so there might be a whole field of
knowledge that AI doesn't immediately
have access to because it's not as
digitized as it could be or it's not or
it would have to buy it and maybe it'd
be too expensive to buy all the buy all
the books in Amazon or something
so there might be some holes in his
knowledge for a while but not very long
uh and then eventually so imagine
telling AI to rewrite history hey AI
go rewrite history but take into account
all of the books written by scholars in
different countries as well as all the
scholars who have written things in
America
what would that look like
how would AI decide what was real
and what was credible
if it just took a consensus of like what
other countries thought was the history
of the United States plus what the
United States thought its own history
was that wouldn't look anything like
American history
if AI wrote it it would look at all the
other opinions of America
because those are valid just because
it's our country it doesn't mean we have
the right history because other people
could watch it at the same time right if
they wrote about it differently than we
wrote about it well that would be a
question wouldn't it who wrote about it
accurately so if AI rewrites history not
just to make it less biased but to make
it more accurate because you know
somebody's going to do that what does
that do right we're supposed to be
learning from history by history we'll
keep changing
this can be very unsettling we won't
know yeah we won't even know who won
Wars we won't know why War started we
won't know who won we won't know why
anybody won
because it might just change
all right um here's a horrible story
then we'll talk about Trump Tech
executive Bob Lee founder of Cash app
uh and he was a I guess he was a notable
attack person in San Francisco 43 years
old and he was stabbed to death in San
Francisco on the 300 block of Main
Street
now this caught my attention not only
because it was a horrible tragedy and we
feel bad for
Bob Lee's family and friends
but this is the same block that I was
attacked with a knife
so I was mugged by a street person with
a very large knife
it was sort of the Crocodile Dundee size
knife
and in the this was in the 80s so in the
80s I was robbed twice at gunpoint while
I was a bank teller in downtown San
Francisco once by gun on the street once
by a very large knife exactly where he
was stabbed to death same block I looked
at the picture to make sure I was
remembering it correctly same place
same place
and
I had one gun pointed at my head and the
trigger was pulled but there was no
round in the cylinder what do you call
it cylinder
um
and let's see my apartment was robbed
once my car was broken into three times
lost three three car stereos
uh
yeah real yeah in the revolver in the
chamber
all right yeah it had no no round in the
chamber
it was a it was kind of an exciting day
when somebody points a gun at your head
and pulls the trigger you remember that
for a long time yeah
finally comment there was a time in
let's say the early
2000s where I was visiting San Francisco
and walking down the street and I
remember saying to myself wow
this place used to be a lot rougher and
now it's all gentrified and yuppies and
full of high-tech people and I was
actually impressed at how San Francisco
had gone from the 80s being a pretty
dangerous place
very dangerous place honestly uh to what
I thought was a model City like one of
the best places you could ever walk
around felt totally safe you know at
least walking in the main places you
felt totally safe
but apparently we've lost all that now
the only thing I'm going to add to the
story is these things might be cyclical
I tend to think that cities are dead
I think they're dead I think the the
next time the cities will be alive is
when robots rebuild them and that could
be a while
I don't think people are going to
rebuild cities
I just don't think they make any sense
because there's there doesn't seem to be
enough willingness to put the law
enforcement resources there that would
be needed for them to be survivable
so I would just get away from the cities
yeah if you have a choice if you have
any options whatsoever just get out of
cities
because I don't think they're coming
back until the robots can rebuild them
in you know 50 years or whatever
all right let's talk about Trump's
arraignment
well it feels like things are back to
normal and by normal I mean all the news
is about Trump and if it's not about
Trump well we don't care
I mean we do care but it feels like he
once again sucked all of the energy out
of the news business
Nobody Does it like he does yeah he he
can suck energy out of the news business
like nobody's ever
sucked energy
on YouTube does it look like I'm too
bright
and by that I mean lighting not
intelligence am I overlit on YouTube
what do you think because it looks about
right
yeah it looks about right let me see if
I can make a quick adjustment here
this could go very wrong
but maybe yes uh well we'll go for that
we're gonna go with that for now
all right so so Trump got arraigned in
New York uh the funny part is part of
the story is that by complete
coincidence
that's a little too dark but we're going
to go with it for now but by complete
coincidence the a court ordered Stormy
Daniels to pay pay back 120 000 in legal
fees on top of the legal fees she
already had to pay back
yeah that's too dark isn't it
too dark
yeah
I'll get this right
um so what are what are the odds that
the Stormy Daniels story would come out
at the same time as the Trump
arraignment
can we calculate that story because
probably it could have happened anytime
in the year
so it was like a one in 365 chance that
any one of them would happen
all right help me with the statistics
there are two events
that are not correlated
what are the odds that they happen on
the same day
in the same year
it's uh one
it's one out of 365 times one out of 365
right
one 365 times 1 3 65th
no just once
oh because the first one is a given all
right so the first one is a given so
it's only the second one you have to
look at
and then the second one has a 1 and 365
chance of being on the same day got it
okay yeah
no that's right
yes 1 and 365. because one of them is
just a given
at some point it's a given right and
then the other one just has to match it
1 and 365. so it was very unlikely but
it happened I think I figured that out
all right with your help
so even CNN at first was underwhelmed by
the quality of the charges
and if you've lost CNN you've lost
you're in bad shape but thankfully Jake
Tapper found a way to make it sound like
it was more important than it was
by saying that there were 34 felony
counts
uh and if you leave out some of the
contacts such as oh no here's here's the
way he said it uh that that he was
talking to Legal people and they said
that the 34 misdemeanor counts were
fairly strong
but there was lack of specificity on the
alleged federal
crime that the misdemeanors were
supposed to be covering up which would
Elevate them to felonies it's all very
complicated
but here's something that Jake did not
mention what he said that the 34
misdemeanors were fairly solid
here's here's something that I would
have mentioned
the statute of limitation had had run
out for all of them
do you think that would be important
you know just just as something to
mention if you're mentioning that the
the charges are solid
wouldn't you mention that they're also
past the statute of limitations that
feels important
because I believe the only way that they
can be made legal you know within the
statute of limitations is if you can
revive this nebulous other charge that
they're related to and then it's the
other charges statute of limitations
which would be applied backwards to the
misdemeanor does any of that make sense
is there any lawyer here to tell me I'm
full of because I'm sure I am
I have no idea if I'm explaining this
correctly
but I do know that if you don't mention
that uh genuine lawyers believe it's
passed the statute of limitations you
have not accurately told the story Jake
Jake Jake Jake
uh number two do you think that at the
same time you said there are 34 solid
misdemeanors do you think it would have
been important maybe to mention at the
same time that it's really just one
charge
do you think that clarifying that the
way the law works is every time you make
a journal entry or write a check or
produce an invoice or pay your taxes if
it's all about the same transaction
it's just one thing you did that they're
going to count 34 times
now I'm sure that they mentioned it
but if you don't mention it at the same
time every time that's not news
that's right here's how to tell
the news accurately
there are 34 charges that stem from one
alleged inappropriate action
just one thing
mischaracterizing you know a payment
the one thing according to experts is
past the statute of limitations the only
way to recover that thing and to make it
still illegal past the statute of
limitations is if we as if the courts or
the jury I guess decided that the other
crime which is unspecified
unspecified
it's an arraignment in which the entire
point is to show the defendant what they
have to defend against and they didn't
tell them
they told them the 34 things that are
past the statute of limitations and they
didn't tell him specifically
the crime that makes the other ones
important
that is as close to an absolute nothing
as anything could be
his his risk at this point is legal risk
a scale of one to ten
it's kind of zero isn't it
wouldn't you say his legal risk is zero
because the experts are saying that his
next court appearance is December which
is crazy to me the fact that you have to
wait till December now I know his
lawyers want as much time as possible
too but it's just crazy how long things
take
but by then the experts the lawyers say
some some higher Court
will have thrown it out
so this entire thing is over literally
trumped up charges and by the way
what were the odds
there's somebody named Trump
would be brought up on trumped up
charges
like literally trumped up charges
it it just it's just such a weird world
and then the guy who did it bragged
about it and his name is Bragg
he bragged about all of his good work in
fact when he gave his talk mostly was
bragging about all the the things he's
done and the experience he has and the
years he's done and how he's always very
thorough his entire talk was bragging
true and who is the famous the most
famous bragger in the world
if you had to pick one person the most
famous bragger in the world it's Trump
Trump is the most famous bragger in the
world
and he got taken down by somebody named
Bragg
I mean come on come on
it's a little bit too on the nose
that's how you know we're a simulation
we are breathing this into existence
so the most the most entertaining
outcome seems to be happening
this is pretty entertaining
uh and I'm pretty sure he's not not in
any legal trouble in the end
so what does the news say when they need
to get clicks and they realize that the
first of his more than one legal
problems turns out to be a big nothing
it's a big nothing so what do they say
when they find out that the current
legal problems are a big nothing
a way to this next one
uh okay okay I'm willing to accept that
maybe the walls are not closing in on
this Stormy Daniels payment stuff
probably it's either just misdemeanors
or misdemeanors that are already expired
and nothing probably a big nothing it's
underwhelming but wow wow do they have
him on this box gate oh the Box Oaks not
the Box Oaks I mean the Box gate those
Mar-A-Lago boxes man
we got him now don't we don't we we got
them now
we still don't know what was in the
boxes
how did we get to this boy without
knowing what's in the boxes
if those boxes
had anything in them that was National
Security related
you don't think we'd know about that
really
really you don't you don't think we
would know already if there were
sensitive National Security secrets in
those boxes
box gate
is going to be ridiculous now apparently
they're going to try to make the real
story not about what's in the boxes do
you know why
do you know why the real story is not
going to be about the contents of the
boxes
because there's nothing important in the
boxes
that's why because there was nothing in
there but mementos and not important
stuff
so so now that has to be about the
cover-up or the resisting uh resisting
rules do you know how easy it's going to
be to defend against the idea that there
was
some resistance or cover-up or something
like that let me explain the entire
defense
Mr Trump did you tell anybody to resist
giving boxes back no
and the end
Because unless they have some evidence
where somebody says yes the president
the president the president you know
Trump told me not to give them these
secrets back
do you think that's going to happen
do you think there's a human being
who in the real world was told by Trump
to keep these boxes secret and don't
give it back and that that person
whoever that is is going to testify that
that happened do you think that's going
to happen
because I don't see any other way he
gets convicted do you do you think
there's an email where Trump said it no
he doesn't do email do you think he sent
a text no do you think there's a
recorded phone call no
at most at the very most
he whispered in somebody's ear or didn't
and my guess is he didn't
now here's here's the most likely thing
that happened
we thought we returned all the boxes
but we were wrong
there were some more boxes
that's probably going to be the whole
story
or I told Bob to give you all the boxes
but when we talked to Bob he thought you
meant only the boxes that were marked a
certain way
it's just going to be somebody
miscommunicated that's going to be the
entire case it's like oh it wasn't trump
it was Bob told Joe and Joe didn't
understand Bob so they didn't get
everything back the way it probably
should have and so there was some
miscommunication it's going to be that
there's going to be nothing to this
story it's just going to disappear
and that's what they're hoping for
they're hoping that's the big one but I
don't think it is
another part of the story involved the
number of charges that 34 charges and
apparently in the legal profession if it
were a federal crime there would be
guidance against doing that do you know
why if it were a federal crime if it
were the federal court do you know why
there would be guidance to not
you know push it up to 34 counts when
it's really just one action it's because
it makes bias if you hear there are 34
charges you think well some of them got
to be real
but it's really one thing so you should
treat it more like it's one thing
or a few things so that you're not
trying to influence some future jury
that mad he did so many things you got
to find him guilty on at least a few of
them must be something he did with all
that smoke
so this is and all that smoke there must
be fire persuasion and should not be
part of the legal system but apparently
at the state level there there's no
specific
guidance not to do that so he did it
so Brad did it you just made it look
like it was a lot of charges and even
through through in some stuff about uh
The National Enquirer and McDougall and
Packer and turns out those have nothing
to do with the charges
he threw in a whole story of bad
behavior
that he's not charging him for and is
not directly related to the charges
who does that
that's the most biased thing I've ever
seen in my life throwing in an unrelated
story that you're gonna it's unrelated I
mean you could say they're both involved
women but it's pretty unrelated
um
all right
so the fact that no no specific charge
was mentioned that would make the
misdemeanors felonies
that's so sketchy I mean that's that's
beyond the sketchiest of the sketchiest
thing I've ever seen in the legal system
apparently uh
uh Trump already raised eight million
dollars as of yesterday I guess off of
this uh controversy
um
but what did you think of Trump's speech
afterwards if you saw it so Trump goes
back to Mar-A-Lago and gives a
teleprompter speech mostly
all right let me let me see your
comments before I tell you mine I'm
reading them off some of them
too long boring good good boring tired
um
sounded tired boring all right here's my
take
I thought it was a poor performance
poor I don't say that often maybe never
I don't know if I've ever said that
about Trump I thought it was a poor
performance by his standards
yeah maybe it wasn't a poor performance
by an ordinary politician but for him it
was low energy
it was backwards looking it was filled
with grievance and it did not have a
forward-looking sort of positive message
at all
um and I'm stealing that comment from
Van Jones because he said the same thing
on CNN but he said it better
yeah so credit to Van Jones as always
in my opinion the best CNN commentator
because that's what I saw too I I saw a
backwards grievance-filled
um unimpressive
100 list of stuff
I just didn't see the the Trump I
expected to see now people said he
looked tired
which she did you look tired other
people have speculated that because the
judge told them not to Not to cause any
violence through his rhetoric that he
may have intentionally toned it down
but it didn't look like that
it didn't look like the only problem was
he was toning it down I'll tell you what
it looked like to me that I'm just
speculating right I'm only speculating
and it only has to do
with how I would feel in the same
situation
I don't think his wife is happy with him
do we agree
imagine poor Melania
who can't leave the house
for as long as this is going on
she can't leave the house
because if she leaves the house
everybody's gonna say hey here's a
picture what do you think of Stormy
Daniels what do you think of Stormy
Daniels how about my Google McDougall
Stormy Daniels
Melania Melania is probably ripping
Trump's balls off every day
he looked like here's my bottom line
Trump gave a speech like a man who's
having marital problems
that's what it looked like it looked
like somebody who's got a problem with
his wife and it bothers him a lot
which is okay
which is okay because that would be the
most human thing that you could imagine
and I do like knowing he's human
I like knowing Trump as human we'll see
we'll see if under a different context
he can you know come back to life but
that day
that very day when he's being arraigned
for that charge and it's all the news
and it's the only news Melania
had to be
super upset
agreed is there any way Melania had a
good day
no
and I think that Trump is not immune
from you know happy wife happy life he
looks he looked like somebody whose
personal life had been torn apart
and he was just trying to get through
the rest of the day that's what it
looked like to me so I don't think it
was necessarily just fatigue although I
bet there was some
I don't think it was necessarily that he
had such a bad day in the legal system
because in a way it was kind of good for
him
it looked like he had some personal
issues and he should have
I mean if anybody's if anybody deserved
a personal issue
I mean maybe he brought it out himself
of course but
I don't know to me that seems like the
biggest possible yes that is mind
reading and speculation
yeah so I like to use speculation
instead of mind reading because when I'm
speculating I'm telling you I don't know
but if you say somebody is thinking
that's mind reading because you don't
know but if you say that's what I would
think in that situation I think that's
fair
all right
Wall Street Journal was pretty hard on
the prosecution
as you can imagine now in my opinion I
want to see how many people believe or
agree with us in my opinion
the whole idea of Prosecuting a pastor
potential president
started with Trump
and has started when he did the locker
up stuff with Hillary
to me
Trump started this president
by looking serious about locking up a
competitor for president
and I think it's just coming back to him
I always thought it was a huge mistake
I I never liked the lock em up stuff it
was kind of funny
but I thought it went way too far and I
thought he should have
you know it's not his personality it's
to stop that sort of thing but in a
perfect world
that wouldn't have happened
because I don't think that was healthy
for the country I think every time I
heard chanting of lock them up I said to
myself you realize that's increasing
your chances of getting locked up right
and it did
yeah I mean I think the the number of
Republicans who are being haunted
right now from the j6ers to Trump to
anybody else has a little bit to do with
the fact that top Democrats were were
threatened with jail
in a historical context in which jail
didn't happen very often
yeah now obviously whatever Hillary did
or did not do would have been different
different allegations of course
yeah I think I think Trump started the
whole
put a politician in jail thing at the
highest level and it just came back to
bite him in the ass and if I had been to
Hillary Clinton
if I had been Hillary Clinton and I knew
that because remember there's isn't
there an audio or email from Hillary in
which she indicated she was literally
afraid that they would all be locked up
that's true right
don't we have evidence that Hillary was
actually literally afraid that they
would all go to jail
now if that was the case
and I if I were Hillary
and I was actually believed I might go
to jail
for because my competitor I would make
sure that I did everything I could do to
put him in jail
that would be my response and it looks
like the Democrats have this you know
full
intention of putting Trump in jail any
way they can
so to me this is just Hillary's Revenge
is just working out through the the
Democratic machine
yeah this is Hillary's Revenge
so this would suggest that if Trump
becomes president
you would probably try to put Hillary in
jail again
probably if there's any if there's any
reason to do it
but I would be just as opposed
all right Vivek ramaswamy played this
situation the best
he uh immediately and clearly and loudly
said that he would pardon Trump if he
were president
that's pretty clear
but he went further and here's the
brilliant part he said he would pardon
everybody who's a politically prosecuted
so that would include the gentleman who
just got prison time for a meme about
the election
I assume it would conclude some January
6 people
and when I heard that I said to myself
that is exactly what I wanted to hear
that is exactly what I want to hear that
somebody would try to get
um
in my case what I would I would call
overcharged
uh overcharged conservatives out of jail
because remember it's especially
egregious in the context of the
progressives wanting to have less jail
time for everybody
really less jail time for everybody
except the president
yeah and and political people
all right
um
Rasmussen did a poll if Biden versus
Trump ran before I tell you the answer
who do you think wins in a matchup
between Biden and Trump if it were today
who do you think would win Biden versus
Trump election today
no no new information election today
you're saying Trump
I see a lot of Trumps I think that's
mostly wishful thinking however
Rasmussen poll agrees with you so
there's new Rasmussen poll says if the
2024 election were between Biden and
former president Trump 47 percent of
likely U.S voters would vote for Trump
while 40 would vote for Biden
that's a pretty big difference in
February Rasmussen ran the same pole
and then it was 45 Biden 42 Trump
that means that uh Biden lost five
points and Trump gained five points
that's a big margin
now I would not expect this to last
because it's way too early these you
know the early polls are not that
predictive
but it does give you a sign of the mood
of the times
so
um here's the here's the biggest
question that people have been asking me
lately Scott do you really think that
Trump I mean seriously Scott
uh seriously you really think that Trump
could win in the general election
really I get that he could win the
primary because you know primaries are
unique but seriously Scott seriously you
really think that Trump
could win a general election in 2024. to
which I said
it only matters who he's running against
he's not running he's not running by
himself
he's not running Trump yes or no
it's an election against another person
if that other person is Biden yeah he
could win
and then people said but Biden one last
time yes last time Biden had not already
destroyed the country
don't you think that's the difference
don't you think that a few you know a
few years of watching Biden destroy the
country you don't think that's going to
change anyone's mind we now have a
perfect snapshot of what a trump
Administration looks like
sort of generically in a perfect
snapshot of what a Biden Administration
looks like somewhat generically
it's a completely different race
before it was unknowns right before
Trump was in office you didn't know
it could have been anything that
happened
but now you kind of know you kind of
know
now here's the question would the
election be so rigged that Trump
couldn't win if he had that margin
in my opinion if the polling let's say
let's say the polling maintained this
Gap
if the polling if other pollsters agreed
that there was this big gap you can't
achieve that much
that's too much if it came down to you
know two counties
yeah
you could cheat you could cheat in two
counties if that was you know the
difference but if it's a 47 to 40 kind
of situation
I just don't think you could cheat that
much and expect to get away with it
maybe but I don't think so that would be
too much
so what I expect is that the margins
will close before election day it'll be
within two percent and then anything's
possible
in terms of cheating anything would be
possible once it gets to be a tight
election on Election Day
all right
um CNN fact checked Trump's speech yeah
he had all the usual fact check problems
but they're fact checking the the Soros
funding connection
now
uh
no there's no there's no evidence that
they cheated let me clarify
what did not happen last time is that
Trump went into it with a huge margin
and then the actual election was super
close that didn't happen last time
right
do you get that
that didn't happen last time
right but this time it's possible it's
possible that to be a big gap going into
the election that you'd have to have a
really big gap
to make to make cheating impossible
you'd agree with that right if the
polling is just ridiculous cheating
becomes impractical at that point
yeah
um
so here's what we know about
Soros funding so Soros doesn't know brag
never met him never recommended him but
he did give money to a political action
committee that gave some of that money
500
000 to support Bragg's candidacy and we
do know that Soros
has been involved with funding
Progressive uh candidates so it's not
technically true that Soros hired Bragg
essentially it's more true that Soros
does things that guarantees you get a
you get a brag
Anthony Sherman asked this question in
all caps may I repeat his question
Anthony asks in all caps Scott are you a
fellow Jew
Anthony
really
we're going to get rid of you Anthony
you know thank God for caps
if it were not for the Caps locking you
could not identify the truly broken
people
why do all the broken people signal I'm
I'm a mental case and then they say
their message
yeah with the all caps
I'm a total mental case
and now here's my message
all right
so
I guess the CNN fact checking is
technically correct
the Soros did specifically say fund this
one guy
but it looks like the claim is correct
enough you know if if for if Soros is
giving money that he does intend and
knows would go to Progressive
prosecutors
or DA's and a guess one and then he gets
exactly what you'd expect from one
I don't know I think the charge is true
enough I'm going to call it true enough
but technically untrue
all right CNN has an editorial that the
word woke is being stolen by largely
white people
and really it's a black word
did you know that
the word woke has been used by black
people for a long time in a slightly
different way
and I think they used it let's see I
think they just woke to mean that you
were asleep and then you woke up
no I'm just kidding they they used it to
basically
keep alert
stay woke just meant you know be alert
look over look over your shoulder
and so a
uh
a editorial commenter said that maybe
the white people should stop using that
word that way
they're trying to take your word
yeah I I think that there's obviously
some
success by the right pushing back
against wokeness because they wouldn't
try to argue that the word doesn't apply
unless the unless the challenge
to that body of activities was valid how
many times do we end up arguing over the
definition of a word
let's see we're to uh so
Trump either committed a crime or he
didn't based on how you define the word
find
if you thought find votes meant pretend
they were there and make them up he's a
criminal
if you think that somebody who complains
that the votes were miscounted says find
votes it means oh count them better or
make sure you haven't missed any
we're really just arguing about what a
word means
how about uh
what is Soros funded mean I mean that's
what the conversation is does Soros
funded mean directly or does indirectly
count what does woke mean now we're
arguing what woke means now we're
arguing what a woman is
so we can't decide what a woman is what
the word woke means what Soros funded
means what the word find means
foreign
so I talk about word thinking all the
time which by the way you're going to
understand a lot better because AI is a
word thinker
the way AI thinks is by figuring out the
most predictive word that would follow
the next sequence that's already there
which is basically Thinking by words if
the sentence makes sense AI thinks it
makes sense
that's what people do when the sentence
makes sense people think that they've
talked logic and you see that all the
time there's a whole group of people in
the country
who let's say would be more close to the
artistic side of things than the
engineering side of things
the the artistic people think that if
the sentence makes sense
the idea makes sense
it does not
it does not it's just a sentence that
could be understood if the sentence can
be understood you didn't make a point
you just said a sentence that could be
understood and they can't tell the
difference they actually can't tell the
difference
an engineer can tell the difference oh
the sentence makes sense but the idea
doesn't
yeah you see it all the time
all right
here's uh my last AI story
I believe that copyrights will become
worthless because of AI
here's why
if in the current model I say I would
like this book by Scott
so you'd say oh I guess I got to buy it
because it's copyrighted so you buy it
in the AI World here's what you're going
to say
I'd like a book by Scott hey AI can you
go read that book and summarize it for
me or just read it read it to me in your
own words
is that a copyright problem
maybe but how would you ever know
if you told AI to go read a book and
then read it to you like it was reading
an audio book to you who would know
besides you
nobody would know
you could turn any book into an
audiobook
just by telling AI to read it to you
if AI can see it
and and every book will be digitized
right every book will be digitized and
every book will be illegally available
somewhere
somewhere it'll be illegally available
even if copyrighted so copyrights will
be absolutely useless let's say there's
a movie
that AI could have access to but you
haven't seen you know think AI could
just reproduce the movie for you
might not be exactly the same but if AI
has watched the movie or it has access
to it it could go get it or how about
this you say the ai ai I'd like you to
give me a new Marvel Superhero Movie
make it unique put it in the style of
maybe have mentioned a writer a writer
or producer you know put it in the style
of this producer and this writer making
new content I like a little more focus
on
Captain America I like him featured a
little bit more and can you replace you
know this can you replace Iron Man with
you know and then you would watch an
entire two and a half hour movie
fully scripted
fully scripted
and it could be as good as or better
than the ones that Hollywood made you
know why it could be better because you
could say don't make it woke or whatever
words you need for AI don't make it woe
you know make it more realistic and then
suddenly you could have a movie without
the wokeness or how about this let's say
you bought a movie so it's available to
you you own it so you say AI can you
take the wokeness out of this movie just
remove all the woke parts and then it
just gives you back the movie without
the woke parts
yeah that's gonna happen so I don't see
any I can't see any world in which
copyrights can last more than the next
few years would you disagree
it might be that some things are still
copyrighted
but AI could so easily imitate them or
steal them without anybody knowing that
it wouldn't it would have no value you
wouldn't be able to
there's just no way you'd be able to
detect it
and and enforce it
so I think that my uh job probably only
has
two to three years left
you know my job so at the moment AI care
right humor some people say did some
funny things but it really didn't
the one reason that I can still write
humor better than AI
is that I haven't taught a I had right
humor yet
if I do
it could probably beat me pretty quickly
but it doesn't know the formula
the only person who knows the formula is
me because I you know I wrote a formula
the The Six Dimensions of humor and if
you use that formula or you teach if you
taught AI what that formula was it could
write jokes pretty quickly
but there's one thing it can't do
which you can't judge whether it's joke
is funny
that's something I can still do that the
computer can't do so if I'm writing a
joke and I get to my final you know
punchline and I look at it I go ah it
doesn't make me laugh
so I don't think it'll make you laugh so
I erase it try something else try
something else try something else and
then I laugh I literally laugh at it I
go oh that's good then I Know You're
gonna laugh too the computer can't do
that yet but it will
certainly it will all it would need is a
huge body of jokes and it would need to
rank them by how much humans actually
laughed at each joke and then it would
know what kinds of patterns make people
laugh and then with the six dimensions
of humor it could create its own
potential jokes and then once it created
it it could bash it against its database
of patterns that actually worked for
human beings
and they could write jokes
it can't be more than a year away
so I think my job is obsolete pretty
soon that's what I think
so here's another surprise for you
do you like audio books and you like
them when the author reads them right
well here's something you maybe didn't
know
there are a few things that an author
hates
more than recording an audiobook
it is really really unpleasant it's the
thing I hate more than anything I do
anything actually literally anything
it's the most hated thing I do it's like
three days of just or four days of hell
just talking into a microphone and
trying to get every word right and
thinking and concentrating too hard it's
terrible do you know what I I could do
now
I could use one of several AI products
that already exist I can feed it the
text of my book and it will read it in a
perfect impression of me
of me
it would it would be irrational for me
to ever record an audio book again
I'm never going to do it
there will be audiobooks of mine but I'm
never going to record one again it
wouldn't make sense
because the computer can actually just
do a better job of me
than I can do of me
because if if they can match me you know
for a sentence or two
then it can perfectly match me for the
whole book and it can certainly match me
for paragraph or two
but if I do it myself
I can also perfectly match myself for a
paragraph but my voice starts wearing
out my energy gets lower as I record
so I would never be able to record as
well as AI can already
imitate my voice
AI already speaks Scott better than
Scott does a lot better for for long
form a lot better it's not even close
imperfections need to be built in maybe
maybe imperfections don't need to be
built in when you buy a a form of music
if you go to a concert there is
imperfection in the performance if you
buy the you know the streaming music
that was made in a studio
the studio
uh okay Gidget you're right
the the studio players are sometimes
actually fairly often not even the
artists who made the album
because the artists who play it live
have a real tough time playing it
perfectly and nobody cares if it's live
but for a studio album
you need a professional musicians to
pretend to be the people who made the
album because they can play it perfectly
so it's going to be like that you know
AI Will Be Your your long form speaker
yeah and then certainly for humans doing
anything like this we'll have makeup
applied by a filter
isn't it weird that Zoom doesn't already
have a makeup filter
is not the most obvious thing Zoom
should have
where I just hit a button and I'm I got
a full full makeup on
yeah
all right
maybe I am AI already
all right is anybody has anybody used my
insult yet that something is GPT one
quality
I told the locals people this this is
our new insult I'll tell the people on
YouTube
if you see somebody who's just being
dumb
a good a good insult that's very timely
is yeah that's uh that's some GPT one
stuff right there
yeah you're come back to me when you can
get up to GPT too
and I'll listen to you gpt3 I might be
interested gpt4 I might even believe you
but GPT one no not so much
all right yeah that's a GPT one quality
performance this is
combining all the insults
all right um
ladies and gentlemen
um this
completes my presentation and YouTube
thanks for joining I'll talk to you
tomorrow
