well good morning everybody emma i'm a
little less punctual than usual
a little bit
just a little bit less punctual
but
does that mean the show will be any less
amazing yes if i keep dropping things on
the ground
it will be far less amazing but
not counting that
things are going to go really really
well this morning in fact
this might be one of the highlights of
your whole
life you just don't know it yet
sometimes
things turn out better than you think
not always but sometimes and if you'd
like to increase your chances of good
luck
all you need is a cup or a bug or a
glass of tanker chalice or stein
uh
canteen jugger flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it turn that category 4 hurricane
into a 3.9 go
i think it's working
well
speaking of
that hurricane hurricane ida
um here's some news this is breaking i
don't think you'll see this anywhere
else but uh
you all know uh journalist andy no
last name is spelled g-n-o but andy now
has decided to identify as wind
uh and he's identifying his wind so that
he can marry hurricane ida
and hurricane ida will take his last
name and then
when people talk to hurricane ida and
they say hey what's your name
hurricane the hurricane will say
i don't know
and then they'll say no seriously what's
your name
i don't know no seriously
what's your name
i don't know
all right um did you see the sleepy joe
fake video
uh there's a video of joe biden
talking to i guess the prime minister of
israel
whose face i don't recognize
can you imagine not recognizing the
prime minister of israel
like i didn't i didn't know who it was
i couldn't have named him i certainly
didn't recognize him it's like netanyahu
was sort of a genius and self-promotion
he always knew who he was right even
when he wasn't prime minister you still
knew who he was
but
i don't even know who the prime minister
is now anyway the prime minister was
talking to
joe biden
at the white house and there's some
misleading video
misleading video of
biden closing his eyes
now
it's being debunked as a fake video
because uh he answers a question
with his eyes closed
showing that he was awake the whole time
and listened listening to the question
so
there's your fake video
but
is it impossible
is it impossible
that he did not offer a little bit
you know what i mean
maybe he he he might have nodded off for
five or ten seconds and then
came back in time to hear a question and
answer
maybe
but uh it's being uh listed as a fake
video i think i think it's probably more
fake than not but
he might have fallen asleep could have
happened
there's also a fake obama video going
around
on facebook
so i guess in the fake uh and it's just
misleadingly edited
he is purported to say ordinary men and
women are too small-minded to govern
their own affairs
which of course he did not say
and the order in progress can only come
when individuals surrender their rights
to an all-powerful sovereign
obama never said anything like that but
that's the that's the video going around
so i guess it's just uh edited to take
out the context
here's an interesting persuasion point
this is probably the least
let's say the least
obvious persuasion point you'll ever see
when i learned hypnosis one of the
things that my hypnosis instructor
taught us
is that people will
be more easily hypnotized if they pay
for it
if you do it for free
people will think it's worth nothing
that's the problem if you say i'll
hypnotize you and i'll do it for free
the person you get hypnotized assumes
you're not very good at it or you can't
do it because otherwise you charge for
it it'd be like a service
so if it's free it doesn't work because
people assume it won't work and then you
can't get people into the right frame of
mind but if you charge them a lot
and put them in a fancy looking office
and wear a nice suit and everything they
will expect it to work because it costs
a lot
and then it works
there's something else like that
happening now
along those lines which is
maybe a big deal and
uh
twitter user named machiavelli's
underbelly who you should be following
machiavelli's underbelly just google it
on or just search for it on twitter
you'll find it
and he he tweets this he says the
biggest reason for so much vaccine
hesitancy
and i'm not joking parenthetically is
that the vaccine was free
now he doesn't go on to explain the
reasoning behind that because it's a
it's a fairly well understood
psychological phenomenon what about that
what do you think about that
do you think
that the credibility of the vaccination
is degraded by the fact they're giving
it away for free
now free means just free to the consumer
obviously your taxes and inflation will
pay for it and obviously the governments
pay for it and blah blah so it's not
that it's free free
but to the person who makes the decision
it's free ish in the short term
yeah as
i have an economics degree so i don't
like to call anything free because
there's always some related cost
but here's the thing
uh the fact that it's free
has that convinced anybody
and they maybe they don't realize it
that it's no good
because they don't have to pay for it
maybe
now i think we'd probably get a lower
uptake if it were not free just because
people you know would be making
budgeting decisions but there is
something to the observation
there is something about the fact that
it's free
or feels free even though it's not
that probably makes it less
less
like makes it look less credible i think
so it's a good an interesting
persuasion point of view
all right um
you may have heard that uh the
anti-trump smugness index has reached a
record low
you know that smugness
when you're pretty sure
that joe biden was a serious adult in
the room
and that clown trump he was getting
everything wrong everything absolutely
every single thing he got wrong
well that was when the smugness index
was at its peak oh very smug
joe biden is going to fix a lot of
problems with that
that trump left
but as time goes by
the smugness index
starts to
reduce
for example
people may be thinking that trump was
somewhat right about black lives matter
and
antifa
because they're not so popular these
days and it doesn't look like they did
anything good
i mean maybe black lives matter did but
i can't think of anything maybe they did
raised awareness anyway
but i don't think people are having a
great feeling about these groups that
were
against trump
uh i don't think the critical race
theory is too uh
as popular as as
it could be in these in the united
states i think people think trump's
largely right about that i think people
think he could have done better in
afghanistan we don't know that but it
feels like he anybody could have
he looks right on immigration he looks
right on taxes he looks right on china
and he looks right on energy policy and
gas prices
so every day that goes by
trump looks better
now i predicted that you know to me that
was an obvious thing because as soon as
the fake news
affect the clouds everything as soon as
that started to dissipate you would see
just the policies
and then the policies
wouldn't look that bad
but the rhetoric does right you if you
add the trump rhetoric to anything it
turns it turns it into a different thing
but as soon as the rhetoric sort of
phase in your memory and all you're
doing is saying to yourself wait a
minute
does remain in mexico policy make sense
and then you think yeah it does
it does does make sense
so he continues to look better
um cnn allegedly did an interview
um
and i guess this was before the uh
explosion uh at uh kabul airport
it was a
an interview with what purported to be
an isis k leader
and uh the isis k leader said he'd have
no problem getting into kabul now this
was before the withdrawal i guess
and he met
he met with the
cnn crew and the only thing he asked is
that they blur his face and hide his
identity
now
if you were a leader of isis
okay
would you trust cnn
to blur your face
are you kidding me
are you telling me that the cia
didn't talk to
cnn and say you know
we'd like to see the unblurred version
of the face
because that would be pretty helpful
you don't think cnn would show the cia
an unblurred copy
now
i don't know if it makes any difference
if only the cia sees it you know maybe
that doesn't make much of a difference
maybe they already knew it was they may
have already had a picture of them
but does it make sense
that an isis leader would want to give a
cnn interview
in such a dangerous way
well apparently skeptics are saying
we're not so sure you actually talked to
an isis leader there
and
yeah
and yeah somebody's asking on locals in
the comments was this guy hit by a
a drone recently and i have to think
that he would have been droned by now
if he really gave that interview because
i think we'd find him right
so
uh i would i agree with the skepticism
i'm not saying it's fake news
but i don't think you could trust that
that was really an isis leader
i don't think you could trust it
i'm just looking at some of your
comments there
um
let's talk about this hurricane
a little bit more
um
apparently it picked up steam uh because
it passed over a lot of hot air i think
it went over congress
but
how much are we going to talk about
climate change because of this hurricane
probably a lot right so every time
there's going to be a hurricane we're
going to have that same dumb debate
where somebody says well it's proven
that it's climate change and then
somebody else will say
it's not proven
there are some flags and some
indications but it's not proven proven
and
here's here's my question
where are the places that are getting
better
on earth because of climate change that
has to be a thing right if you imagine
that
there are just as many places on earth
that are
a little too low a temperature to be
optimal
and there are some places that maybe
we're at the right temperature but now
they'll be a little too warm
shouldn't we have stories about the
amazing
uh
you know the the farming yield
that they've never seen so good coming
out of i don't know some damn place
shouldn't we be seeing that i feel like
the news is removing the context of all
the places where things are much better
because it has to be the case right
anyway it seems like it would be
so alex berenson
famous uh let's say contrarian i think
i'd call him a contrarian has been
suspended by twitter
for what twitter calls covet
misinformation
now do you think that
alex berenson
did actually say something that was
misleading
dangerously
on twitter
did he well here's the tweets that got
him kicked off
so i won't get kicked off because i'm
talking about it i think if you state it
to be true you might get kicked off but
i'm talking about the story so i can
talk about it
so berenson said
don't think of it as a vaccine
think of it at best as a therapeutic
with a limited window of efficacy and
terrible side effect profile that must
be dosed in advance of illness he says
in all caps
now which part of that as he notes
i guess
he indicated he might be thinking of
legal action but which part of that is
inaccurate
let's take it part at a time okay
um don't think of it as a vaccine
is that accurate or or inaccurate well
it doesn't matter because that's just an
opinion all right so don't think of it
as a vaccine it's just an opinion about
what to call things so that you know you
don't get kicked off for that kind of an
opinion i've said the same opinion by
the way and i didn't get kicked off
he goes think of it at best as a
therapeutic
now do you get kicked off for that
i don't think so because i've said it
how many times have i said the vaccine
is really more of a therapeutic i've
tweeted it i've said it in public a
bunch of times there's no problem
because when i say it
i give my reasons and those reasons are
known to be
true
which is that the vaccine doesn't stop
you from getting
doesn't completely stop you from getting
the
illness
so in that way a reasonable person could
call it more like a therapeutic than a
vaccine so so far it's just opinion
and it's just opinion about what the
words mean and that's completely fair
right i don't know if it's meaningful
but it's fair
all right the next thing he says is a a
limited window of efficacy
well now you're getting to a little bit
more of an opinion that's
kind of pushing on fact
does it have a lin
limited window of efficacy
well
yes and no right
because it does have efficacy that
decreases over time and the booster
shots would presumably you know boost
that back up
so in theory it doesn't have a limited
window of efficacy
as long as boosters are a thing so in
theory it would be unlimited forever
efficacy
so long as you got boosters
right now remember we're in the fog of
war so people are adjusting as they find
out data and now they're adjusting for
the boosters and i'm not saying you
should get one or not i'm just just
talking about
whether uh
whether there's any disinformation or
misinformation in this quote all right
so i would say limited window of
efficacy
subject to debate
i know what he means he means that if
you get one shot it's going to wear off
before the pandemic ends
so i think what he meant to say is
accurate
but because things have changed with the
booster is sort of his accurate
statement
sort of drifted into inaccurate didn't
it
now i think he said it probably after
the boosters were already conversation
but it's kind of a it's kind of an
interesting one because it's more about
the way he says it
than being inaccurate entirely
and then he says about the vaccinations
terrible side effect profile
is that true or false
true or false
that the
vaccinations have a quote terrible side
effect profile
what would you say
what would you say true or false
somebody says true for some
but then would it be fair to say it
that's just a statement if it's only
true for some
i'm seeing lots of truths let's see on
youtube if you think it's true i'm
saying no
too strong too strong a statement
maybe
as compared to what more than terrible
no idea
uh false fine
so this one's a little ambiguous isn't
it
because i would agree that if you were
one of the people who has a bad side
effect
if you happen to be one of those unlucky
people
could it be said that you got a side
effect
that was terrible
if you happen to be one of those people
then yes you could actually maybe die
so that would be terrible
but
when you say it has a terrible side
effect profile
are you sort of suggesting
that it's a bigger risk than it is
because it's certainly terrible if it
happens
but is he referring to what would happen
if it does happen which would be
terrible
i think we'd agree with that
but it sort of suggests the terrible
part
sort of suggests the risk
as well as what would happen if that
risk came true
and i don't think that the risk the size
of the risk
not what would happen but the size of
the risk
i don't know that it would be reasonable
to call that terrible
because it's sub 1
well under 1 right is that a terrible
side effect
it would be a terrible outcome
if you're one of the bad ones you know
you got a bad case of the side effect
but the odds of the side effect are
really low aren't they as far as we know
i mean we could find out later
so i would say
i agree with twitter on this
sorry
sorry
i agree with twitter on this
opinion now i do think
that he should have gotten a chance to
rewrite it for clarity and then
you know be back on twitter so i'm not
sure a suspension makes sense
but
if they're standard is
misinformation
then i would say that the ambiguity of
the tweet just the ambiguity
because i think berenson is completely
correct that what he believes
to be true
and what he said he believes he said to
be true
are accurate
so i think berenson has a pretty good
argument
at the same time
there was enough ambiguity there
that i think twitter was within its
moral and ethical
um boundaries
now
it's
a pretty close call isn't it right now
i'm not saying they should have that
standard
it's a different question
i'm not i'm not defending that they have
a standard i'm saying that they met the
standard
not that there should be a standard
right that's a separate question
but
i think they i think they met their
standard i don't like it
right i'm i would rather see the
skeptics than not see them i'd rather
you know the
the the debate happened in public than
just have him kicked off of twitter i
don't think that's the best way to
handle it
but i feel like they they met their own
standard
for what that's worth
all right
um this is the point where those who
don't like vaccination stuff should uh
you you can you can find something else
to do but i'm only going to be talking
about the odds of things i'm not going
to be telling you to get it or don't get
it
and here's the kind of information that
we get
on vaccinations see if this tracks with
what you believe to be true all right so
here's the only test we're going to i'm
not going to tell you something israel
is not true
is rationalizing censorship a side
effect of the jab
maybe so um
so i'm not going to say these are true
these are just statistics that come off
of cnn but i want to see if it agrees
with what you think is true
so this is cnn's reporting if you're
fully vaccinated now your chances of
getting infected go down by three and a
half fold
is that your understanding that if
you're vaccinated
the odds of getting infected in the
first place
are way way lower three and a half times
lower
is that your understanding because i
actually
wasn't sure what that
was until i read it today actually
how about this
your chances of having symptoms if
you're vaccinated go down by eightfold
is that does that agree with sort of
generally speaking how you thought of it
did your did your sense of it match that
um the chances of having symptoms go
down by eight fold that's about what i
thought it was i mean not necessarily
eight but i thought it was a lot
um your chances of ending with illness
significant enough to go to the hospital
go down 25 fold you probably knew that
right
you probably did know that your odds are
being hospitalized or way way down 25
times lower
and more than 99.99
percent of people who are fully
vaccinated
have not had a breakthrough case so let
me say that again
of people who are not vaccinated the
odds of them
you know
getting it and then passing it on are
pretty good
but if you're vaccinated 99.99
chance
um that you'll not have a breakthrough
case you could still you could still be
infected but not
not necessarily get symptoms
um
and then here's this last one and i i'm
guessing that these statistics are
debatable
right you're probably going to debate
this but according to cnn states with
below average vaccination rates
had on average almost triple the rate of
new covenant cases compared to states
with above average vaccination rates
this is according to john hopkins johns
hopkins university
do you believe that do you believe that
the vaccination rate of states very
very highly correlates with how many
infections you're getting
i don't know maybe
all right here's uh here's my warning of
the day on data
whenever anybody talks about a specific
country
assume it's wrong
sometimes it won't be but that's only
five percent of the time i'm guessing
this is just based on my observation of
life over over the years and here's
another one so uh
twitter user uh people's pundit some of
you follow him so he's rich the people
spun it baris
and he tweeted that sweden went the
natural immunity route as opposed to
israel which went for vaccine immunity
and that
that even though one one went for
vaccines and one did not the sweden
actually is doing better
now is that true
well how long did it take for the very
next twitter person to say no sweden is
50 vaccinated fully vaccinated and
israel is only 60
fully vaccinated
i don't even think those statistics are
right
but
it doesn't take more than a second for
somebody to tell anybody who says
anything about a country
it takes about one second for somebody
to say you got the data wrong here's the
right data
now i don't know if the second person's
right maybe the first person is right
but the thing you need to know
is if you're making any kind of decision
any kind of decision
based on what one country did
that's not rational
because the one country comparison of
anything sweden israel
china doesn't matter
new zealand
as soon as you're looking at the one
country you're not in rational territory
anymore
how many people believe that
i'm still seeing people say but sweden
is doing pretty good
listen to me
can i i'm gonna i'm gonna say make the
same point
but i'm gonna say in a more emphatic
like jerky way
because i don't think i'm getting
through
if you're talking about the results of
one country
stop it
it means you're not good at analyzing
things in fact that would be the number
one flag
for people who are good at analyzing
things what would be the biggest red
flag that you're talking to somebody
who's not good at analyzing things
they tell you that they're looking at
one country and they've determined
something as soon as you hear that
you know you're talking with somebody
who's not experienced at analyzing stuff
all right
somebody says read alex berenson let me
tell you
the
skeptic problem
now i like to give you these examples of
categories
of risk which is different from knowing
whether one thing is right or wrong all
right so a category for example
would be there's a rogue doctor who made
a viral video saying all the experts are
wrong
in my opinion
whenever you see the rogue doctor
there's a 95 chance at least it's
no matter how sensible it sounds
no matter how good his graphs and data
are
just know that the category of rogue
doctor disagrees with science
is going to be wrong 95 of the time
that's just based on experience right
it's not based on
some study
but five percent
five percent if they're ever right you
you books are written about them and
they become heroes and you know this
this scientist was the one who was right
when everybody was wrong and einstein
knew that you know newton wasn't
completely completely right about
gravity but nobody nobody thought
einstein was right until you know took a
while to figure out he was
so you hear about all the stories about
the five percent time the rogue expert
is right
but just now
if it's day one and you're hearing a
rogue expert 95 percent she has no
all right here's another category
a professional
skeptic tells you something is wrong
so
berenson
also
is a skeptic about marijuana and says it
should be i guess he wrote a book saying
it should not be legalized now i'm not
going to get into the debate of whether
it should or should not be legalized but
would you agree that's a contrarian view
that's the only point it's a contrarian
view he might be right
and he might be wrong
but i'm just saying it's a contrarian
view did you take a contrarian view
about masks yes did you take a
contrarian view about
vaccinations yes
did you take a contrarian view about
basically everything
yes
so how much should you treat or how much
credibility should you put
in a someone who has a track record
of being the contrarian
low really really really low
which doesn't mean he's wrong
he could be right about everything
you know he might be the the one
contrarian who just gets everything
right good could happen
but whenever you see the contrarian
who's just sort of
automatically against everything that's
standard belief just sort of
automatically
uh
that that that pushes on the credibility
now
you've seen me
disagree with the
uh these standard opinions over and over
and over again
but you've also seen me be right about
it more often than chance would suggest
so you have to look for your special
cases but i'd say if somebody's just
automatically a contrary
you've got to factor that in
all right
so uh
what are the economics
of vaccination here's what i think
and i'm going to give you a little
surprise there's a little surprise in
here coming it's it'll be a surprise
coming from me that's for sure
uh if you if you took an economics
filter
on the question of uh natural immunity
versus getting vaccinated
um what would it look like
well i would say that the the price of
of
the coronavirus versus the price of the
vaccination
if you were to look at that that way
i would say that
not getting vaccinated
has an extra price which is the
long-haul covet risk whereas getting
vaccinated has a you know smaller price
for that
otherwise
it's kind of immaterial the the only
price
that you would consider
probably because the risk of actually
getting coveted dying versus the risk of
getting
a side effect from the vaccination and
dying they're both so small you can just
round them to zero
but the risk of long hole coving is big
enough that that's
actually part of the calculation
i saw two doctors today on twitter
doubt
long haul coven is a big deal
now and one of them said quite
reasonably
it's like we're not hearing much about
it lately are we
to which i thought oh my god that's
another dog not barking
you have to look for what's happening
but also what isn't happening they
should be happening
if any of the estimates of long-haul
covert were accurate
i feel like it's all we'd be talking
about
there's something going on
now if you talk to dr drew he'll tell
you he had long-haul coveted and there's
not much doubt about it
and he's a doctor
and you know he's uh steeped in this
stuff
so
i don't doubt him i think he had
long-haul covert
and i know at least one other person who
seemed to have had long-haul covet as
far as i can tell
yes it's anecdotal right it's anecdotal
so you have to you have to say yourself
well that one report of the one person
you never know you never know um
and it'll give you a uh
an example that as as you
many of you know i was on prednisone for
too long last year
and if it if you get off at prednisone
after you've been on it it just messes
at least in my case it just messed with
my health for months
but did i have long-haul prednisone
i don't know maybe it was some other
problem it just happened to ha
it happened at the same time so i just
assumed i did
so
i'm gonna i'm gonna agree with the two
doctors who who questioned my
assumption that long haul is gonna be a
big deal and big enough
to be the major part of your decision
i don't see any headlines about it today
or yesterday or the day before do you
i mean for a while we were talking about
it quite a bit
and then we just sort of stopped talking
about it
when it should be the biggest factor
in other words if you were trying to
convince somebody to take a vaccination
what would be the most convincing data
you could give them
it would be long-haul covet
that would be the most persuasive thing
because everybody thinks the odds of
dying of the covid
and the odds of getting the vaccination
side effect are both really really small
like one is even smaller than the other
but they're both so small you just
discount them both
but
long haul code
if that shit's real
that's your biggest decision point in my
opinion that would be your biggest
decision point and we just stopped
talking about it
i i think the two doctors who called me
out on that just totally got me
right i don't i don't usually
well actually
uh let me let me take this as a learning
point here
uh the learning is this
i've told you that i uniquely because of
the way i've positioned this podcast
that i uniquely can say i was wrong
because i don't have the incentive to
say i was right
once the data you know suggests that
maybe i wasn't my incentive is to tell
you i was wrong because the nature of
this live stream
is showing people's blind spots and
psychological mistakes
so if i make a
big psychological mistake
in analyzing something or have a big
blind spot and then i find out about it
that's exciting to me and i would want
to tell you that i would want to say man
i was wrong about this
and it's starting to shape up like this
might be one of those cases
because i made i made most of my
decision
on that long-haul thing
and now i think it's reasonable to be
quite skeptical about it
because we're not hearing more about it
it's the dog not barking as much as it
should
um scott how is your prion disease
coming
um
scott one minute ago don't believe
quacks scott now believe those quacks
did i say anything like that
did i say anything like that
no i didn't
all right uh
long haul is similar to the sonic weapon
it might be
yeah that would be the theory
the theory would be that uh it's mass
hysteria
along with confirmation bias along with
coincidence etc
i it seems to me that if kovid kicks the
 out of you for a month
that your health isn't going to be that
good for the next three months
am i wrong about that if you if you get
something that just kicks the out
of you
it doesn't matter what it is could be
coveted or something else don't you have
three months of bad health after that
because you just it just takes a while
to get back
so i don't know maybe it's just that
um
uh let's see towards the end we had
several people with the exact same
symptoms
uh
yeah
so let's uh let's put that out there as
some skepticism that
is earned
and that
is what i'd like to say today now let me
do a temperature check
so i just talked about
vaccinations again and you hate that
you've told me loud and clear you're
sick of it
was this discussion
especially if i put it at the end
um
somebody says yes i hate it
well i'll put it at the end so and then
i'll flag it so you can know to to go do
something else and i don't mind that you
do by the way
if
if anybody says hey that content is not
for me
uh well you know
that's certainly subjective and i
respect that completely and i also
respect that you told me
um
i don't know if i've told you this
before
but i have an attitude about criticism
and it goes like this if it's just a
troll then you know i like to use them
as entertainment and and mock them
online but if somebody has a criticism
that actually hits home
and i feel like oh well that's not my
opinion but sure are a lot of people who
have that opinion so i'm gonna take it
seriously to me i hear this the sound
cha-ching
cha-ching
when when people brutally uh
criticize me if they're right
right sometimes i'll say yeah you got a
point and this is one of those
you're definitely right
that i talk too much about you know
maths and vaccines
and i told you why because not much else
going on but that's not really doesn't
help you right the fact that's my
problem that's not your problem
25 from chad chad
uh did i make a credible and persuasive
argument did your fact checkers find
fault with my claims or questions
um chad for 25 i don't know what your
exact question is me
did i make a credible and persuasive
argument tell me the
exact persuasive argument you're talking
about
um
uh the fear factor seems inflamed
oh glenn beck is funding afghan
extractions i saw something about him
trending
so that would make sense
um
scott is doing mental gymnastics because
he's jabbed well
what would that be
what mental gymnastics what i do i just
told you that the biggest variable that
i considered
i now doubt to be even true
if i had confirmation bias it would look
the opposite of that
so confirmation bias would be me saying
yeah
yeah all those studies about
uh long-haul
totally true i believe them
that's what it would look like if i
rationalize it but i just did the
opposite i got the shot
and then told you that my biggest
variable for my reason for getting it
could be very flawed like completely
fake news
now
do you not hear me say
that there's really good evidence
that my biggest decision variable wasn't
even true
all right chad says about no wide scale
serology being done no acknowledgement
of or recovered included yes i think
chad i think other people agree with
that as well you're definitely
overpaying to make these comments but i
agree with you
that we should have continuous
widespread serology to find out how many
people have already been infected and we
should
as far as i can tell
it doesn't make sense to give
vaccinations to people who've been
infected
but you know unless they have some
immunity problem
but i'm no expert so i'm not gonna i
don't think i would be in inclined to
override the experts on that but i would
certainly want people to have an option
yeah it's one thing to say that you
should or should not get the vaccine if
you're already immune
uh that part i can't speak to that's
science beyond me
chad just
just took me five dollars just to say
thank you for reading his comment for 25
chad you're overpaying
[Laughter]
all right but he's entertaining
all right uh yeah chad's getting his
money's worth i guess
um
all right he's good points
yeah i agree
uh
do vaccinated people get long-haul that
i believe has not been studied but if
you do believe that vaccinated people
get far less symptoms in general it
seems reasonable
i mean i would be amazed
if if long-haul covet actually exists i
would be amazed if vaccinations don't
substantially reduce the risk of it
but
you know we could be surprised our
common sense only goes so far in this
kind of domain you have to be kind of
kind of careful about
whether your common sense is really
sensible
uh somebody says long haul seems to be
something made up to scare
well i can tell you that the people who
think they had it
didn't make it up
i mean
it could be a coincidence but
you know a lot a lot of real people
think they had it
um
why do our experts push vaccines but not
diet and exercise
well you know there are plenty of
experts you see saying hey
do more diet and exercise
um
but
i don't think people can do that as
quickly as they need to it's sort of
it's not the quick solution but yeah
i feel like we should be
at least persuading on that all right
that's all i got for now and i'm going
to
go do something else
and as usual i enjoy our time here today
i hope you're using it to exercise or
take a walk
which is exercise or i hope you'll be
using these uh podcasts to get something
done while you're listening
so that you
can be
double productive all right and that's
all for now
