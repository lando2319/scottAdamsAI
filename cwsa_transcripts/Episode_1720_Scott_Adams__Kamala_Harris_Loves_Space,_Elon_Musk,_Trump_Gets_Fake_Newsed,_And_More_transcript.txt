oh
good morning everybody
and congratulations for making it too
the highlight of civilization some call
it a morning ritual but your your brain
might want to process it differently
you might say to yourself This is just
something you do to have a good day or
maybe you come here for the fellowship
which is a vaguely sexist sounding word
but I don't know what the other word
would be the personship
and by the way I'd like to make an
announcement that I've made a decision
on pronouns everybody
pronouns I have been resisting
having pronouns mentioned in my profile
or anything but I've I've decided to
embrace it for what it is so my pronouns
are
number one if you remember the media
and you're speaking about me in any any
reporting kind of a context I would like
you to refer to me as they
they only they
anything else I would find deeply
disrespectful
however if you're not a member of the
media
I would invite you to use any pronoun
you like just like before
just like before so that part won't
change
so it's very it's very narrow I I insist
that the media referred to me as they
I did not come up with this idea but I
wish I had because it's pretty darn good
uh and by the way would you like to take
this experience up a notch
yeah
yeah I know you would and all you need
is a couple of mug or a glass of tanker
towels to sign a canteen drag to flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and joining me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the dopamine
the other day it's the thing that makes
everybody feel better makes your
oxytocin Spike it's called a
simultaneous sip it happens now go
oh
yeah
save Red Save red
okay good
well I'd like to make an announcement
um I will use this platform to make a an
important announcement
bulletin bulletin breaking news breaking
news
are you ready
I will be introducing
in the coming days the first
black Dilbert character
I know overdue isn't it that's what I
said
but I've told you before that the reason
I have never introduced a black
character into Dilbert
was number one how the heck do I draw
that character
so it's not going to get me in trouble
how do you do that
right so I have a solution for that
and the second one is what kind of
um
personality flaw can I give this
character as a white author in 2022
writing for a black character that I
would add to the Dilbert cast which I am
adding
and how do I do that without
getting canceled
and I thought to myself there is no way
to do it
it's impossible cannot be done without
getting canceled
so so we're going to take a run at it
because if there's one thing I've always
known about my career with Dilbert
that at around the age 65
sort of that retirement age you know
traditionally I'm not I'm not planning
to retire immediately but you know sort
of a traditional retirement age 65. I
always said to myself
should I play it safe at 65
I mean really should I
no
if I'm going to get canceled I want to
go out in a big flaming Fireball
the worst thing that could ever happen
to me like this would just be so
incompatible with my personality would
be just to say hey folks I've had a good
run uh I'm going to disappear now
you couldn't do that
how could I do that if I'm gonna go out
I want to take the whole block with me I
mean not really you know what I mean I'm
talking about if if I'm going to leave
the stage you're going to know I left
the stage if you know what I mean this
is gonna be there's gonna be uh this
could be debris and Rubble
I'm going to make sure it's exciting I
promise you so here's how I solve these
problems
number one I drew the black character
looking like all the white characters
except he'll be colored black
because I realize that none of my
characters look like people
so why why the hell did I have to worry
that he had to look black except for you
know the actual physical color of the
Skin So basically you'll just have the
same features as everybody else
but he'll have a shaved head ah let's
see what I did
so I don't have to I don't have to deal
with hair
because he has a shaved head
and I don't have to deal with any kind
of like facial difference that would you
know make it look racist in some way to
somebody somebody would think so I just
make it look like every other character
in The Dilbert comic because they don't
really look like people anyway
all of their noses are just the letter c
so you know it's not like I'm making
some big differentiation between uh
individuals so
um and and by the way this was because I
asked on Twitter
for suggestions especially a black
cartoonist to make a suggestion but when
I saw when I saw some
some different versions that other
people did I thought ah somebody figured
it out
somebody figured out how to do it so I
just basically learned from that
and that in terms of the personality
flaw do you want to guess what the
personality flaw is
what will be the character's personality
flaw the first
black character added to the main cast
hahaha
somebody says Perfection right so I
don't want to do what uh Burke breatha
did when he added a black character he
made the character a hacker
so that the black character would be the
smartest person in the in the thing but
you know would be a little naughty
because it was it was an underage kid so
you know that's kind of naughty he's
hacking right so so the way he did it
was a little too woke
even earlier it was a little too gentle
but just sorry you had to do that right
he avoided being canceled so it totally
worked it definitely worked
so here's what I settled on as the
character flaw and by the way did I tell
you the character has a name
yeah so the character has a name and the
name will start to give it away
his name is Dave
so he was the first black character in
Dilbert whose name will be Dave
but here's the running gag
you'll never know when he's pranking you
because on the first day he's introduced
the boss will introduce him as a
solution
to their diversity problem so the boss
will say explicitly hey we hired Dave
because we need to get more diversity
and then Dave will say
I identify as white
and it goes from there
so Dave
the first black character you're never
gonna know if he's just screwing with
you
so you can't tell does he really think
that identifying this way is like
actually just what he wants or is he
just making it difficult at his boss
and so
because it's ambiguous
the the staff will
be endeared to him because he will be
such a pain in the ass to management and
and management would just won't know
what to do with them
because he knows he can get away with
murder
because he can
just because he can and so he's going to
use it
to just have the best time with a
straight face
now what do you think
I feel like I solved it
did I not I feel like I solved it now I
didn't do it alone I did it with a lot
of help right so part of my process is
interactive I ask people for suggestions
and you know I I use them in the script
so I don't want to I don't want to
devalue the value of the um the input I
got on this character it was quite good
and I appreciate it
and I just think it's funny that his
name is Dave
hahaha
anyway
um
and it may may or may not be Loosely
based on my brother
whose name may or may not be Dave and he
may or may not be famous for you can
never tell if he's telling the truth
well I'll tell you one story
just just so you can get a sense for it
I remember my brother visiting me in
college
because he was a coincidentally he was
dating somebody in that college he was
older and uh it was around Halloween and
he picked up a pumpkin that was in his
then girlfriends or the woman he was
dating in her room he lifts it up and he
starts talking about I forget how it
started but he said he'd been a pumpkin
after
and of course she asked a pumpkin after
what's that
he goes well pumpkin after you know if
I'm sort of paraphrasing here
from bad memory but I believe he said
well a pumpkin after I used to work on a
pumpkin farm and you couldn't weigh
every pumpkin but you still needed to
know their approximate weight so they
would have trained hefters and the
Hefner would uh would pick up the
pumpkin and they see they judge his heft
and then they would record that and then
throw it on the truck and uh so that he
was but he was picking up the pumpkin he
was like ah this is about 3.2 3.4 pounds
whatever he said and uh everybody was
quite impressed at his experience as a
pumpkin hefter now I happened to be in
the room and so I was supporting the
story with details
um I don't I don't remember what I said
but I might have said something like I
tried to be a pumpkin after but it takes
some sort of natural skill I didn't have
it but I worked for years trying to
match my older brother's pumpkin hefting
talent and they had to drop out you know
because not everybody makes a great it's
sort of like a summer sommelier
sommelier some people have it some note
yeah if you came in late this isn't it
doesn't make a lot of sense does it but
anyway Dave the first black character uh
will have a little bit of a personality
like that
all right credit where credit is due
we'll get to that in a moment Kamala
Harris was giving a speech about space
and I'd like to read it to you because
it's rather moving
um
yeah whoever wrote this for her I don't
know maybe she wrote her herself but I
think somebody wrote it for her and you
may have heard that uh there have been
staff
defections on the Kamal Harris staff
so I'm guessing that the talent pool is
might be getting a little thinner
specifically the speech writing talent
pool may have I don't know may have
gotten a little less I I'd like you to
judge so here's the stirring or
oration that she gave about space
she said I think everyone here
recognizes how extraordinary space is
whether it is satellites that orbit the
earth humans that land on the moon or
telescopes that peer into the furthest
reaches of the universe
space is exciting
it Spurs our imaginations and it forces
us to ask big questions space it affects
us all
and connects us all
now
I took this to heart because I found it
moving
and
um yesterday I was thinking I needed
some more bottled water
and normally what I do is I drive to my
local Safeway get a few you know a few
cases of bottled water put them in the
car drive them home that's my normal
process
and but after I read this and I found
that the space
it affects us all and it connects us all
I thought I should
maybe think again and so before I drove
to the store and forgot my bottled water
I
I appeared into space and I tried to
figure out how how it was affecting me
and how I would affect that because I'm
connected to everybody through space and
the last thing I want to do is move some
empty space
the fact that which will cause a ripple
effect because emptiness does that
that's just that's just physics and so
if you push the emptiness The Emptiness
will cause like a domino effect
affecting all of us connecting everybody
and I thought I could kill somebody just
by going to buy water
because the space variable that I had
not considered once not once I had not
even thought about this
now that I've been spurred in my
imagination
to know how extraordinary space is
I will take it into consideration in all
of my thinking and all my decisions
because it's so extraordinary and big
also very big
very very big and extraordinary that
space
and not only that but listen to this
this is important she said our space
capabilities per
this I swear this is like
Dr King soaring oratory
uh if you don't get goosebumps from this
next sentence
you're dead inside
all right let me say it again
vice president Kamal Harris
um our space capabilities provide for
Global awareness Global connectivity and
Global navigation
yeah it does oh tingles
do you feel that oh
wow
soaring
that's all I have to say about that
um but then she gives the uh the payoff
here this is why our Administration has
proposed the largest single increase in
our military space capability in our
nation's history
um well
okay that part's good actually
so credit where credit is due
if you ignore the fact that she's
emptier than space itself
if you ignore the fact that Biden
is a few uh quasars short of a of a
universe or something I don't know I was
thinking on the Fly there
um this is actually the right thing to
do because they have identified the
spaces vital for the future it is for
for defense of the Earth Defense of the
country economics everything so he's
doing the right thing
just uh doesn't seem like they're
selling it just right
all right let's talk about Elon Musk
being interesting again he was talking
about Netflix and he said the woke mind
virus is making Netflix unwatchable he
said that on the 19th two days ago
what was the day that Netflix stock
tanked was it right after he said that
or right before it
was he responding to it or did he did he
make it take
no I think their numbers made a tank
because they lost subscribers and they
were they were forecast to gain a few
million and they actually lost
um was it
did I not tell you the same thing
basically I've been telling you for a
long time the movies are unwatchable now
and and there's a very simple reason why
if you're a writer and you have to
service wokeness
it's so it's so restricting that you
don't have enough tools to to get a
proper story going if you could do all
the wokeness and still get a proper
story well okay then you've got
everything
I suppose
but if the wokeness makes it too hard to
write the story and I think probably it
does
then you just get crap
and I think that all movies and TV are
now just unmitigated crap at this point
it's not even it's barely an
entertainment
field
you know and I've got I have I think I
signed up for almost every streaming
service there is or at least you know
the top six or whatever because I was
desperate to find anything I could watch
anywhere
that would take my mind off the fact
that I've drawn Dilbert 11 000 times and
I've got to do eleven thousand and one I
just want anything that isn't terrible
to be on and I can't find it this is
nothing all the streaming services you
can you can run through the ones you
want to watch
in what three hours that's it then
you're done and then you're you have to
you forget to
and then you go back and look every now
and then I go back to the Disney
streaming app every now and then now
let's see what they got nothing
oh they got something new I wouldn't
watch that
is anybody having the same problem that
is it's impossible to watch a show
because it's so hard to find anything
that you would watch and you're not sure
why it suddenly went from all kinds of
stuff to watch to nothing to watch
and some of it's because it's crap but
others is because
by making the interfaces all different
apps and different ways to find things
it's just so damn hard to find something
let me give you an example
if I want to if I want to go back to
watch a movie I just started which I
tried to do I don't know where to go
look
I say to myself oh I'd like to watch the
rest of that movie that was on uh
Netflix
and their look is not there I go okay it
was probably on uh
it's probably on Hulu
nope
HBO plus
uh no Disney plus no
and then I end up timing out
try this experiment here's the
experiment I wanted to try there's two
two of you so you and a spouse or a
friend try this exercise order some food
and sit down with the food with the
intention of turning on your your iPad
or your TV and finding a show you can
watch
before your food is done
so you start eating and you know
flipping through the channels and see if
two people can find a show that they
would both watch before all of your food
is done you can't do it can't be done
it cannot be done
unless you happen to be the two people
who will watch anything
some people
well so I agree with Elon that the woke
mind virus is killing the streaming
services just movies in general
uh I guess Tesla announced that they're
making Robo taxis
and that they're expecting them to be uh
to be in volume production in 2024 what
in two years so these would be
autonomous Robo taxis so there'd be no
no steering wheel and no pedals Maybe
I mean I'm not sure anything's confirmed
at this point and there are a number I
guess actually
Elon Musk did confirm that I guess and
they said there'll be a number of other
Innovations around it around it which
are quite exciting
now
there's a lot in this story
do you have any idea how big this story
is
because you read this and you think oh
it's another story about you know maybe
autonomous cars and you think it's like
flying cars and you probably won't have
to worry about this in the future
no this is one of the biggest stories of
all time here's why
number one
if you're his biggest Tesla
and you want to enter a new market so
that you can keep growing
you have to take over gigantic markets
or else there's not enough in the market
to grow your company because you're
already so big right so if you're a
trillion dollar company it doesn't help
you much to buy a billion dollar company
or or get into a market where you can
only make a billion dollars so he has to
go after enormous markets enormous ones
now the self-driving Market
I think is that one right it's the only
thing that looks like it could be bigger
than
um individually owned cars
because over time don't you think
self-driving cars will take over for
regular cars they will
it just will I'm not even open to the
conversation it will and I'll tell you
why in a minute
but suppose we got to a place where we
had mostly uh autonomous cars what would
that do well besides solving climate
change
do you know how easy it would be to get
from one place to another if if people
didn't own their own cars
and that maybe sometimes you can share
one or it just comes when you want it
and it knows it knows where all the
street lights are doing so it never has
to stop for a light because it knows
where the other autonomous cars are so
they can just cross each other at you
know slow speed but you know they never
have to stop
um
so you so you basically you changes the
entire energy structure of the planet
over time assuming it's successful right
um it would eliminate drunk driving
now you say to yourself how is Elon Musk
or anybody going to sell this to
Congress or the states or whoever has to
approve it because there's going to be a
regulatory hurdle here right
Elon Musk could cut could could clear
that regulatory hurdle
fairly easily
and I'm not sure anybody else could but
I think he could do it easily so first
of all he's got the reputation
right he walks into a room and people
think he can do what he says he's going
to do right
so you know he's got that working for
him so all he has to do is show his work
uh an autonomous car we'll do a we'll do
a pilot program
so we'll we'll limit the things that we
have more data so we're asking only
approval for a pilot in a certain place
and I guarantee you that deaths by
automobiles will go down substantially
in the place that's only automated cars
let's say there's no regular cars on the
highway it's just an automated car area
um uh actually I guess it would have to
share the road to be a good test do you
think you can sell that
because I I'm pretty sure he can sell it
based on drunk driving deaths alone
he wouldn't need to sell anything else
he's like look here's one thing I'm
going to eliminate drunk driving deaths
um eventually
and uh some of these and he's the only
entrepreneur I've ever heard say that
his product will probably kill people
he actually said that about flying to
Mars now not a specific product but he
basically said going to Mars will end up
in people dying
and we're going anyway
because it's that important
that is a really unusual thing for an
entrepreneur to say like directly people
will die
go into Mars
I think Elon Musk has is the only person
who would be credible enough to stand in
front of Congress and say
autonomous Robo taxis will kill some
people
who else could say that
who else could say that directly
autonomous Robo taxis will kill some
people
they will also save tens of thousands
more per year
because no drunk driving at least
wherever these cars are you know in the
short run it doesn't say much because
they're just Feathering into the the mix
in the long run it eliminates one of the
biggest causes of death
right
so
and forget about drunk driving just
automobile accidents in general
so you don't think do you think Elon
Musk could not sell
the honest story that the robo taxis
will kill people don't kid yourself
don't kill people we don't mean to we're
going to do everything we can to make it
happen not happen but it's going to
happen we're just going to save so many
more
so can you approve that
how do you get turned down can you
imagine can you imagine Congress turning
down that proposition
assuming that it you know he sells it in
a clean way and then he goes to Twitter
and just starts it just starts
dissecting anybody who said no to it
I think he gets a yes
don't you
I don't know if anybody else could but I
think he would
um think about how far these are our
best entrepreneurs are thinking ahead
um Jeff Bezos is building you know it
seems funny that Bezos would do
amazon.com and then he's doing his own
you know rocket making company Blue
Horizon like those those don't seem like
they fit together
but you know someday he's going to
deliver Amazon packages
to off-world locations right
that that's totally going to happen just
not right away
Amazon will absolutely deliver to other
planets
that's going to happen
isn't that weird the Bezos like these
guys are so so far ahead of the Curve
that you can't even see what they're up
to
I mean space is important in general I
mean it's just a good market so maybe
that's all the reason the Bezos needs
but
Amazon is going to have to compete with
companies that can deliver off-world
someday so he's going to be ready for it
it's kind of it's kind of like insanely
smart
here's what else is insanely smart do
you know what Tesla's biggest risk is
aside from supply chain I guess uh
Tesla's biggest risk is self-driving
cars
right
so unless it plays in that game
and I think the self-driving cars are
not just going to be the autonomous cars
but I think it's going to be no steering
wheel situation I think that's where
it's going so musk is probably
accurately understanding that his entire
business would go out of business and I
don't know
15 years or whenever autonomous cars
become the thing unless he makes
autonomous cars so he's basically
launching the company that will put his
current company out of business in a
sense right because once everything is a
robo taxi you don't need to buy a Tesla
but he will be Robo taxi too and it will
be bigger than Tesla
maybe so that the size of these bets and
how many decades in advance they're
thinking is just is thrilling it's
honestly just thrilling to watch people
uh operate at this level and with this
amount of vision
well speaking of interesting things
Tulsi gabbard is taking some legal
action that I say with quotes legal
action against Mitt Romney
for Romney did a tweet in which he
accused her of treasonous lies and
Russian propaganda
and I guess she's got her lawyers to
send them a cease and desist letter
basically warning him away from calling
her a traitor
which is deeply insulting I would
imagine to anybody who has served in the
military
or is serving and uh anybody who just
sort of doesn't like stuff like this
which is awful
I'm
I'm pretty sure he's never said anything
that would rise the level of a
treasonous lie or Russian propaganda
that is a hell of a thing for a sitting
Senator to say about a private citizen
because remember
she's a private citizen now
she was a politician so I mean that has
to be factored in but she's a private
citizen at the moment she hasn't she has
not announced she's running for anything
am I right
uh let's get rid of the stroll
goodbye Joel
um so anyway what do you think of the
fact that she's going to take legal
action meaning writing a letter so it's
just a letter
I think it's kind of perfect if she
tried to sue him well that would be you
know too much but getting your lawyer to
write a letter and then getting
depressed to act like it's a legal
action
which makes you think it's a lawsuit but
it's not a lawsuit it's just a letter I
don't think he has any legal anything
right it's just a letter from the lawyer
hey cut that out but but then that makes
it a bigger story so she gets to show
her side of things which I think she has
the the stronger point and then her side
of things get some error and then Mitt
Romney looks like a uh looks like a jerk
so it was a good play
uh well played by Tulsi gabbard I'd say
and poorly played by Romney I think I I
just don't know what he thought he would
gain by that
so I asked this in a tweet and it got so
many retweets that I thought well maybe
a little mention it here
and I tweeted that I'm not a republican
as most of you know but the fact that
sporting free speech in 2022 forces
people to assume you are one is making
the option look attractive how would you
like to be running for election as a
Democrat
well knowing that if somebody comes out
in favor of free speech they're labeled
a Republican
just think of it
that you get labeled a Republican
just because you're in favor of free
speech
I mean can Republicans win any harder
than that and again I'm not a Republican
I'm just observing from the sidelines
I'm like oh my goodness I mean yeah the
the most basic tenet of the Constitution
and freedom free speech and people just
say oh that's sort of just a republican
thing
that's where we've gotten to in 2022.
the New York Times is reporting that the
justice department is going to appeal a
Court ruling that struck down Federal
Mass mandates on public transportation
what what
are you kidding me
I want to use profanity
but I do it too much
so I'm trying to hold back
well if if this were not happening the
exact way is happening I would say that
the way to approach this is to defund
the justice department or at least we
should bring it up
somebody needs to bring it up because if
the justice department has time to
appeal a Court ruling about masks which
is
I don't think any of their business
because they're not exactly a medical
entity and they're not I don't know
I'm not sure on what grounds are going
to do it but it doesn't matter we don't
want them to do it at least I don't want
them to do it so I think the way to
approach this is to literally say you
should defund the justice department
because you you should actually call in
the director and say congress should
actually call him the director
uh of the who is it Garland and just uh
and just explain why they have so many
resources that they could do this
I want him to explain what they're going
to not do so they can do this
don't you want to see them say you know
everybody has limited resources wouldn't
you like to see the Senate bring him in
Garland and say you know
we make all these budget decisions and
it doesn't look like your budget is
being used
in a wise way and the evidence is if
you're doing this what is it that you're
doing you're not doing
like what what things got pushed back so
you could do this just make them say it
in public
just make make the justice department
say in public what they're not doing
so that they can do this
and just make him explain it because
this one speaks for itself you don't
have to argue it you need to make them
argue it you know what I'm saying
you don't have to argue the other side
make them defend it
just make them defend it their side
that's it
oh my God
well Rasmussen did a poll about uh what
American voters think about Russia in
the 2016 election
and sure enough 47 of likely U.S voters
think it is likely that Russian
interference changed the outcome of the
2016 election
including 26 percent who say it is very
likely
um
interesting
so what do you think about that
so we are we are so addicted
to our Russian conspiracy theories we
just love our Russian conspiracy
theorists now
this is this is such a indictment of the
fake news
because
anybody who saw the actual interference
I don't think
you know if you're talking about the
memes if you actually saw the memes and
how little money they spent like a
hundred thousand something they spent
nothing and the memes were ineffective
so if you didn't know that you might
think it was some big program I said the
only thing the only other thing is that
something got hacked and we're blaming
it on Russia
do you know why we say Russia hacked
what was it the
podesta's email or something
did do you know why we say Russia did it
because it would we know because uh 50
former and current intelligence
officials said so
no that's not true I made that up
but it's the same idiots who
have been lying to us about everything
everything
so the only evidence we have of Russia
interference is that the same
Liars who've lied about everything for
years say that they're pretty sure that
cash out us the proof but trust us
totally Russian for hackers
now I'm not saying it wasn't
because I think you get kicked off of
social media if you do that how would I
know
but you know what I I do know there's
only one thing I know for sure
there is no information about whether
they did it or not
there's none because the only
information you think you have is from
the same Liars who we know for
sure
for sure they lied about hunter's laptop
they lied about Russia collusion they
lied about everything it's the same
 Liars so if the only reason that
you believe that Russia interfered is
because the same Liars who lied
about everything about Russia every time
it's because they said so and they won't
show you their work oh because it's
Secret
can't show your work
right if you believe it
because they said it
you're an idiot
at this point I mean honestly now if you
believe it because you think there's a
good reason it happened oh okay right
I'm not saying it didn't happen
so if you believe it for your own
reasons
you know maybe maybe your own reasons
would be of course they're doing it
because we're probably doing similar
steps to them and you know it's just
routine that would be a good enough
reason and I would accept that as a
totally totally reasonable speculation
but if the reason you believe if your
reason for believing that Russia hacked
anything in the United States that
affected the election is because you
were told by the Liars who don't show
their work the most confirmed guaranteed
definite documented Liars
the no question about it that we're not
guessing we know they're liars and they
lie on this topic
they're not even generic Liars
they're liars about this
so far
three times right yeah wmd is another
one
so just just check your thinking
it's okay to think Russia did it for
your own reasons but not because your
government told you that that would be
really dumb if you believed it for that
reason that's not a reason
all right
um are you following this uh Amber Heard
and Johnny Depp story I really didn't
want to look into it because I just
thought it was icky
it really was but
uh here are some of the things that we
know Amber Heard did so she threatened
John apparently she accused Johnny Depp
of
abusing her but now we know that she hit
him
apparently lots of times threw things at
him she threatened suicide to control
him if he didn't do what she wanted she
was going to kill herself
um
she used gas lighting she lied she
projected
um and she got hysterical over little
things and she actually thought that the
things she was doing were little
she thought that physically attack
attacking him was no big deal
do you know what this all is
you should Google vulnerable narcissists
there are a few different words for it
but not to be confused with grandiose
narcissists a grandiose narcissist is
just somebody who thinks they they
should get credit for doing awesome
things
so that would be Trump
so Trump would definitely be one of
those I don't know what else he is but
he's definitely someone who thinks he
should get credit for doing awesome
things
now I'm one I think I mean if I could
diagnose myself I love getting credit
for doing things that
are good
why wouldn't I so
you know I always said that the the
grandiose type are actually useful
because they work hard to get credit
I feel like I do that I feel like I work
hard to make things better because then
people say oh you helped and I go oh did
I that feels great I like that feeling
so
I guess that's what I am since I like it
I do it for my own enjoyment as much as
the benefit of other people
but
if you look if you Google a vulnerable
narcissist and look at the checklist of
behaviors then listen to the Amber Heard
and Johnny Depp story I'm no medical
expert
and one thing you should never do
is diagnose somebody's mental health or
other health from a distance
I'm going to do that right now she seems
clearly a vulnerable narcissist like
really obviously clearly like I would
put a really big bet on it I'm no doctor
I'm no expert
but I'd put a really big bet on it and
let me tell you what do you know what
the solution is
if the if she is a vulnerable narcissist
do you know what the experts say that
Johnny Depp should do
if this is true
run
yep it's it's there's only one
recommendation because people who fit
this profile are closer to monsters than
people
and I know that sounds like a an over
statement you're like okay they're not
monsters you just they're just annoying
or you may be they're hyperbolic or
something they're not monsters no
they're actually monsters
now you don't believe me
there are people on on this live stream
watching
who have had this experience
and they've been in a relationship in
the comments you tell me monster or no
just just in the comments just watch the
comments for a moment because not
everybody's had experience with this if
you've never had experience with it it
doesn't sound like it's real does it
I mean it doesn't sound like somebody
could actually be that way yeah so look
at the comments and you can see for
yourself the people who've experienced
it know that this is not even like a
regular person it's not like a human and
when you listen to the Amber Heard
audios
my take on it is she doesn't sound human
because she couldn't
she wasn't
um prioritizing what a human would
prioritize
if I can say it that way so she it's I
get this whole uh
uncanny valley feeling with her like oh
my God that doesn't even feel like a
human
the thing she was saying I think she was
completely straight on the recordings
that we heard it didn't sound like she
was drunk or under the influence it
sounded like her actual personality was
a monster
now and when you hear that Johnny Depp
was like hiding in bathrooms and
literally hiding from her because she
was so dangerous and then you see how
much projection she does how many lies
she tells how much gaslighting she does
and it's all in the it's all in the
audio you can you can hear it all for
yourself apparently she's throwing pots
and pans at him and believes that he's
just a basically
that she believes that beating him up
physically beating him physically which
he she acknowledges she did in the
audios
is no big deal and he's just sort of you
know being weak if that's a problem for
him
that's a monster
right the person who does it is a bad
person
the person who does it and tells you you
should put up with it
and that makes you believe it
that's a monster
right hitting you is just an
right A lot of people have been in
abusive relationships that that's a
drunk an
somebody who's got an angular issue
there's lots lots of reasons for it and
you could call them lots of things
but if you hit somebody and then
convince them that they deserve it and
they're less of a person if they even
think there's a problem with it you're
you're not those things those things are
bad enough
you're a monster
because you're trying to destroy him
mentally as well as physically
you know I guess every abuser is doing
that so I guess it would be fair to say
that always happens
um
yeah wow
all right so uh maybe you can learn
something about the Monsters uh Among Us
by following this Amber Heard thing the
funniest thing about it is that part of
the story
is weird is that Johnny Depp woke up on
two occasions to find what he is quite
sure is was human excrement on the other
side of the bed
that he believes was done
as something she did to make him unhappy
I don't know I don't know exactly the
theory of it so there's some mystery
about this and she says it was the dogs
but Johnny Depp says he's lived with
these dogs a long time and he knows dog
poop and he knows human poop and this
was the latter
but the best part about it is that
instead of Amber Heard trending the
hashtag that's trending today is wait
for it
Amber turd
moment a moment of Awesomeness I I just
have to stand up for that one
Amber tired
yep
[Applause]
you can't beat that one yeah you just
can't beat that one
and you're right there's a commenter
says this is the best show ever and uh
you are right you're right well uh in
the two movies about Ukraine uh
we have another movie uh let's see this
one comes from
uh Michael McFall
who seems to know what he's talking
about but he says that uh Putin has
failed to achieve any one of his goals
for Ukraine and then he lists all the
things that
in his opinion were Putin's goals or
Putin actually said it in some cases and
were not accomplished now that's one way
to look at it because you could say well
he didn't take the capital
he hasn't conquered and held an entire
major city yet although maripole is
there's nothing left of it and they've
surrounded The Defenders there so that
was sort of a gray area but
um so yeah and then he hasn't completely
controlled everything and hasn't you
know hasn't demilitarized hasn't
denassified so so Michael mcfaul he
makes he makes a reasonably good
argument
um that Putin is failing
but you've also heard the other argument
that Putin is completely succeeding in
whatever he wants he'll get if he
doesn't have it yet so he's not done
he hasn't lost anything he's just
chewing along and he'll get it when he
gets it and I think both of those movies
or those frames or points of view to me
they're both alive
to me they're both completely alive and
and also completely alive is that the
Ukraine's the ukrainians could pull out
a victory
I think is still possible I don't think
it's likely
you know the the odds of it probably go
down every day but there's lots of
things that could happen here war is uh
unpredictable by its nature but here
would be my counter to McFalls take that
um Putin did not achieve any of his
goals was it a goal
did he have goals or did he have a
system
because he certainly had a you know some
things he wanted to achieve whatever
word you want to put on it but I feel as
if he you know he had a starting
approach but probably always knew
that he would have to keep adjusting
until he got what he wanted
so is it a goal or is it a system
because the system is all right I need
to take this Ukraine problem away and
maybe get some Glory
all right so I guess you could say
that's a goal but it's kind of like a
high level goal whereas a specific goal
would be to take the capital
I don't know if they had a specific goal
I feel like it was more of a system of
degrading Ukraine in every way that you
can in every direction in every possible
way so it was hard to stop him
so the Defenders couldn't concentrate
their forces in any one place because he
was just shaping the I guess they call
it shaping the battlefield right he was
creating he was creating the conditions
everybody had to react to
as just normal military system or a
process or strategy I guess
and that even though things didn't go
the way he might have predicted that
might have been irrelevant
right it might be irrelevant that it
didn't go the way you predicted because
you know what he might know
he might know that war never goes the
way you predict
what if he knew that
because that wouldn't be hard to know
I would imagine most generals would
agree oh yeah War rarely goes the way
you predict so you better be ready
to make the adjustments
so if what he did is said I need to
handle Ukraine militarily like I need to
get
make sure that it's not a threat and he
also wanted a land bridge and he also
wanted some Glory
and maybe he said I'll just keep
throwing assets at it until I got it
they'll give up on the sanctions over
time we'll come out way ahead in the
long run
I don't know I I don't know if you could
say he's failed
would you
let's split it to a vote has Putin's so
far now remember it's just so far
so as of today is Putin succeeding or
failing go
based on your reading of the news
succeeding or failing
uh
I'm seeing more well actually it's a
mixed bag
yeah inconclusive
I think you'll get the land bridge
I think you'll get the no NATO
but they're not going to demilitarize
probably they might who knows was it
they still have to negotiate
all right we don't know
see how weird that is all right there's
a video of Putin who's looking kind of
sick he's just talking to one of his
um defense minister I guess and he's
sort of gripping a table and his head is
his head is over to one side and it
looks kind of small and his posture is
bad and uh one one doctor said it just
looks like it's allergy season
yeah it looks like you might just have
an allergy because they didn't look too
well but that doesn't explain why he's
holding the table the whole time in a
weird way he looked he looked really
uncomfortable
which is weird for somebody who is
running the country and in charge of the
person that he's talking to and he and
he's the one who asked for the cameras I
guess
I imagine
so the whole situation is one he wanted
he should have been comfortable in it
but he looked really uncomfortable so I
don't know what that's about it didn't
look like drunk
well maybe I don't know what it looked
like
but uh don't assume that we can look at
it and know that he's going to die or
anything but it was very unusual I think
it's worth calling out even if we don't
know what's going on
well the Biden Administration is putting
six billion dollars into uh
trying to rescue as many nuclear plants
in this country from closing to try to
keep them open running and the reason is
that it's a it's a carbon-free source of
power that helps to combat climate
change
now may I give credit where credit is
due
this is exactly right
the the exact right play is to keep the
existing plants open if they can do it
safely
because that's the best way to get a lot
of electricity that you wouldn't have
otherwise right and and again this is
credit to Michael schellenberger and
Mark Schneider and people have been
persuading on this very point for a long
time and
the Biden Administration is doing it
now I think that the Trump
Administration should be should have
done it
don't know why they didn't maybe they
thought of it maybe they were working on
it it could be that this is a
continuation of an energy Department
thing maybe I don't know but yeah it
does seem a little late but uh I can't I
can't uh ignore the fact that Trump
didn't do this and this is the right
thing to do
everybody okay with that yeah even if
you support Trump he was wrong on this
or were less effective on this I think
so unless they waste their six billion
dollars
um which is possible it looks like a
good idea
there's some fake news about Trump he
did a interview with Pierce Morgan who
has a new show I guess and uh the the
advertisement or whatever you call the
trailer for the show uh is rupard
together it's so it's a fake edit that
makes it look like they were mad and he
walked off at the end which didn't
happen
so he didn't walk off and he did say
some uh insulting things to Pierce
Morgan but it was all if you saw it in
context
if you saw it in context you would see
two people who probably like each other
on some level
and are operating at the peak of their
their games
they they both know how to get publicity
and they both know how to generate
energy and then use it as they want
so Pierce Morgan is probably perfectly
fine with the fact that he's being
criticized for this trailer because now
everybody knows he has a show I didn't
know he had a show did you I found out
that Piers Morgan has a new show
by learning that uh that he made a fake
video about Trump and uh and Trump is
now angry at him or acting angry again
I'm going to say acting because Trump
also knows how to work this right so
Trump does this press release he says
Pierce Morgan like the rest of the fake
news media attempted to unlawfully and
deceptively edit his long and tedious
interview with me he wanted to make it
look like I walked out of the interview
when my time limit of 20 minutes went
over yes so Trump had given him 20
minutes and he went like an hour or
something
um
so I think Trump's explanation is you
know he he might be shortcutting it a
little bit too much but essentially it
was fake news
uh but I don't know this doesn't feel
like regular fake news does it this
feels like two people who knew exactly
what they were doing
and we're operating at that level where
they they didn't need to they didn't
need to collude like I doubt there was
any time that Trump and Pierre said look
you know we'll we'll do this fake edit
you act angry I'll I'll fight you for it
we'll get good ratings
I I doubt they said it explicitly but
you know they're both operating at such
a high level of understanding how to
move energy that I think it was just
obvious it was just the obvious play
so I'm going to actually compliment uh
Piers Morgan because I think he knows
what job he is yeah I think he knows his
job right he knows he's in the business
of generating attention
he got some
he emailed it all right I got an answer
to my question when was the first time
that I said China is too risky for
business it was 2019.
and I said how long before CEOs CEOs
find it unsafe to do business in China
and the answer is about three years
so that's when the Wall Street Journal
did an article saying it was risky to do
business in China
and
so you must ask yourself did I predict
it
did I cause it
is it a coincidence
it's probably not false memory because
you can actually find the Tweet yourself
um
how'd that happen
because if I predicted it how did I
predict it I wasn't aware of protecting
it or is it the simulation
did I did I program the simulation see
there are lots of possibilities and we
don't know any of them
we don't know probably just a
coincidence but
here's the second question you must ask
yourself
how many times if I said I was going to
make something happen and then it
happened by coincidence
by coincidence
lots of times
and at some point
you you have to imagine
well you can you could say that China
was always risky
but we didn't frame it that way
certainly people weren't thinking of it
that way
um
it's around 50 that's no better than
random chance
fifty percent of things I influence
I would say that would be a lot better
than random chance
if you if you could change fifty percent
of the things you tried to change with
persuasion you would be the greatest
Persuader of all time
that's a really good batting average are
you kidding
so there's somebody who thinks I only
succeeded half the time like I'd be
pretty happy with that
can I make Trump win again you know I
don't think I could prevent him winning
I think all he has to do is want to run
and he can prevent it himself I suppose
I mean he could self-immolate and and
you know he's going to get close to it
no matter what you know that if Trump
runs he's going to fly so close to the
sun because it's fun there you know he
gets a lot of attention and I think he
can't I don't think he can avoid the the
energy
oh econuclear
all right our Gen 4 reactor is being
called econuclear I hadn't heard that
before I'm just reading a comment over
on the locals platform
uh you think Putin is going to die
before Biden
no
uh
uh how could I live near SF and not know
that GM's cruise is already operating
the driverless AV
Fleet there well actually in the Bay
Area there are a number of uh what a
number of driverless cars
so everybody knows that lives in the
area but um if Tesla says they have a
robo Taxi
I take that pretty seriously all right
that's all for now YouTube I gotta go do
some other things I'll talk to you later
