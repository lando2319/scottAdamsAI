so after dillbert got published it uh
sort of uh sat there for a few years
without much interest but when it took
off it took off big and it was on the
cover of a number of magazines I'm going
to show you some more but it made uh one
of my books the dilber principal made
number one on the bestseller list at the
same time that my other book dogbert's
top secret management handbook was
number two so I had both the number one
and number number two spots on the New
York Times bestseller list in
1996 so things started going crazy in
1996 you can see a whole bunch of
magazine covers that featured either me
or Dilbert but I want to show you some
of the notable
ones this was Time Magazine and I made
the list of most influential people in
America in
1997 except you know something different
about my picture
that's right they literally made me put
a picture of Dilbert in front of my face
so I finally made it to the cover of
Time magazine in a positive way and uh
they made me cover my face oh
well
but it was also in a lot of different
places it was on Advertising so this is
dber on Lend
magazine we've got uh
ink cover of ink
we've got
Newsweek did Newsweek several
times back when Newsweek was a bigger
deal than it is now back when there was
something called a TV Guide Gilbert was
on
that and then my proudest moment my
mother when I first became a a
cartoonist and I would tell my mother
hey I was written about in the Wall
Street Journal they mentioned me and she
would say
we don't get that one can you get in
People
magazine so finally after years of
toiling I made the cover of People
magazine for the 25 most intriguing
people of the year
but they didn't show my
picture just a little picture of
Dilbert these are real people that's
what they actually look like but not
me so I'm not taking you too personally
that nobody wants to show my face in
public and here's Fortune which featured
Dilbert every year for years once a
year and another
Newsweek and here's another
Fortune yeah there were there's I've got
a pile of them there's just a lot of
covers and stay
there the most important thing you need
to
say is the
2025 dber calendar I don't know if I've
ever mentioned this but it's back made
totally in America and you can get it
