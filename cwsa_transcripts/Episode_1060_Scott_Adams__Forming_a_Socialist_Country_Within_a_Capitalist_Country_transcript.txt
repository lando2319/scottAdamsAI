hey guess what
yeah it's me it's not the morning
isn't that weird well some of you have
been asking for some
evening periscopes i don't know if i'll
do this
often but i thought well you probably
miss me right
a little bit a little bit and so i
thought i would make a very
special evening periscope in which i
will tell you how to fix
absolutely everything everything in the
country
every problem i'm going to show you how
to fix the
the risk of robots taking over our jobs
i'll fix systemic racism i'm going to
fix
the economy i'm going to fix retirement
i'm going to fix the environment
all of it really and i see that
there are roughly enough of you here for
me to tell you
how to do that now let me give you the
setup first
here's the setup i don't believe
that in the future the that capitalism
will work for everybody
so that's the starting point in the
future capitalism
just won't work for everybody now that's
always been true right
it's always been true that they're
winners and losers in capitalism
but because what it takes to succeed in
capitalism
will be harder and harder meaning if you
don't have a stem degree
you don't you don't have something
special going on
it's going to be harder and harder to
make it in capitalism it's going to be
harder to
get yourself an education the cost of
moving someplace and getting a place to
live before you get started
it's very hard so the first assumption
is that capitalism hasn't always worked
for everybody
but that that situation will get worse
and then as the robots come in well that
is really bad
because the people who are rich will own
the robots
and get richer the people whose only way
to make money
was to work will be replaced by robots
so the first assumption is there is no
circumstance
in which capitalism just by itself
without a tweak
can work in the future because it'll
just be an increasing number of people
for whom it
doesn't work that's pretty much
guaranteed
likewise here's another system that
absolutely can't work
socialism right a pure
socialist system something that maybe
the marxists and black lives matter
might like you know the leaders are are
trained marxist
some of them so they might like a world
where there's more equality you know
people are treated more fairly there's
less
or ideally no institutional racism
so they'd like that kind of a world but
what's the one big
problem with the world that
socialists would prefer there's one
really big problem isn't it that they
would be conquered by a capitalist
country
they would be conquered almost
immediately by
i don't know china russia anybody wants
to take a go at it
mexico canada pretty much anybody
because if you're if you're just trying
to make everything fair
you're not really putting a lot of money
into the military and eventually
you're just sort of a sitting duck so
we've got
two systems on the table that i would
i would say neither them could possibly
work in the long run
capitalism will fail because the robots
will
unemploy too many people and that it's
only good for the few capitalists
socialism can't work because eventually
that the average comes down
you're not creating extra money because
you don't have the
the same incentives as capitalism and
then you can't fund a proper army
and you have other problems as well and
so it collapses on itself
so what do you do here is my suggestion
out of the box
now if you're new to my periscopes let
me
tell you that when i give you a wild ass
idea
don't take it too seriously okay
they're usually designed just to make
you think differently
maybe think optimistically maybe give
you some
starting point where you say well you
know scott your idea was kind of crap
but it made me think of my own idea
that's pretty good and if it only does
that
that's fine so what i'm trying to do is
to shake the box here
a little bit more than it has been
shaken and introduce
this new idea are you ready
two systems in one country you get to
pick
which one you want and you could move
back and forth
now before you judge
before you judge let me map it out for
you so i'm going to show it to you on
the
the white board and walk you through it
so that's that's the starting premise
why must we have a system
that we know won't work or doesn't work
for everybody
if potentially and i haven't sold you on
this you have to wait for the
persuasion part potentially why don't we
just
put two systems in the country
and just run them parallel all right
i'll give you the explanation but first
let me say
we already do it we already do it
look at all the senior citizens who are
retired
basically socialists right you know so
senior citizens
are already a whole different system
they're not capitalists not per se
right they may have saved up some money
for their retirement but they're not
working
and they may be getting more from the
government than they're putting in
so we already have two systems it just
happens to be for
senior citizens but we also have a
separate system for
children don't we children don't have
the same laws
they don't have the same rules they have
a whole different system involved you
have to go to school
it's not really your choice completely
different system
children are not working they're not
really capitalists
it's a whole different system and does
it ruin capitalism
it doesn't it doesn't they they seem to
coexist
so here is my framing
for two systems in the united states
again if you're just joining me don't
take it too
literal just take it as some
brainstorming that might make you think
a little differently
that's why you should get out of it and
now you want me to call these
capitalism and socialism but i'm not
going to do it
the reason i'm not going to use your
labels is that they come with too much
baggage
so i'm just going to say that there
might be some people in the country who
would want
a society that really maximizes equality
of outcomes
so just equality is what they want in
another part of the country that is more
concerned
with defense notice i didn't say
economics
it's because economics and national
defense or even private defense
are really the same thing you need money
to fund an army you need money to be
secure
in every way that people need to be
secure so making money
and capitalism is really a defense
kind of an idea with extras
so imagine if you will that we carve
down some space in the united states and
on the other side of the board i'm going
to show you that idea
oh there's there's a good part coming so
if you bail out before i get to the good
part
you're not going to know that this is a
good idea all right
so i hate to tell you you got to wait
for the good part
so just imagine that you have some uh
carving some space within the united
states and you just say
uh you can live the way you want to live
and you can even make up your own
constitution or laws and you do not have
to fund the military
you're just not part of the military
thing we'll do that the people who want
to work
because the people who would move to
this land were not
probably the you know the scientists the
engineers
because they're probably going to say
you know i got this engineering degree
and i could do pretty good over in the
regular
country so i think i'll just stay there
so you'd have equality world which of
course would be you know multi
everything multi-ethnic multi-religion
multi-everything
and of course both both worlds would be
multi-ethnic
multi-everything so this isn't about
black lives matter
i'm not saying hey you make a place
where all the black people go if you
heard that
you're hearing the wrong thing so both
of these worlds are completely
melting pause situations they'll just
handle it differently
over in defense world there's capitalism
and you've got to be ambitious
they're going to be paying for the
national defense they like their police
they're very consumerish and acquisition
oriented
and they probably have traditional
families
now you may say to yourself wait scott
why why do you have the traditional
families only on one side
with these money-making capitalists but
you don't have it on the equality side
they could have why can't they have
strong families because everybody knows
a strong nuclear family is a big plus
statistically speaking it seems to be
the main variable
of keeping you out of jail but
did you know that a traditional family
works best
if he got money traditional families
work really
well for people making a lot of cash
because you can get your
your help you can have you know two
family incomes and then
any you've got all kinds of resources
so the rich people don't have to have
traditional families it wouldn't be a
law
it would just turn out that way that
they would prefer to
self-organize around traditional
families not required
no requirement whatsoever it would just
work out that way
the equality people would be they'd have
to be self-sustaining
did you like that part the other part of
the country
at least after some start-up phase would
not be
funding anything that's happening over
in equality land
so they they would for financial and tax
reasons they would just be separate
is that entirely possible i don't know
but we're going to brainstorm through
this just in case
so this place would be self-sustaining
and it would mostly center
around low skilled work which i will
tell you what that will be
as my big surprise when i turn over the
board
it would be focused on a very low cost
of living
but high design when i say high design
i mean this is there any reason that a
low cost
homes organized and i'll say a
neighborhood is there any reason it
couldn't be beautiful
no there's actually no reason there's no
economic reason there's no nothing you
could make
inexpensive homes in a community really
attractive
so that you just enjoy being there the
feng shui of it the way it makes you
feel
there'd be enough green enough open
space there's a whole bunch of stuff you
can just but
you can fix just by orientation to the
sun
how do the roads work how far away is
your neighbor
do you have a porch or at least a place
to go outdoors
is there a place to put the dog how far
do you have to go to work
i mean all of those things are design
questions they're not
spend extra money questions it's just
where do you organize it
so if you imagine it's a super low cost
of living place
and let's say that they've got universal
health care and free education
well how do they how do they pay for
that well i'll show you
they're all working so just like in
defense world
they most of them if they want them they
have jobs
because you really can't have a
community where nobody does some work
so there's got to be work it will just
be low skilled
and they'd have free education and free
universal health care
let's let's assume that they can figure
out how to afford that
through the the work that they do
because there would be
trade so i'm going to show you in a
minute that although they might be their
own
little nation if you will within the
nation they would still have lots of
people coming through
they're still trading and still doing
taking money and
you know etc they're selling goods etc
so they're not just an island then
because they have free education and
they have
the other things that would give a kid a
good start
they have a way to change over to the
other
world if they like so let's say a kid is
born into this equality world and the
kid is
super aggressive and let's say not
aggressive let's say
ambitious kid is super ambitious
so you say and the kid says you know
i've got a i've got
the internet and i'm seeing this world
over here and it looks pretty good
i don't know if i live here this isn't
my thing
you know the rest of you guys you could
stay here i'll visit
but i'm really ambitious as long as this
kid has free education
and they've figured out how to solve the
you know the fatherless situation
and crime and all those other things
which would be part of what they would
solve
so there's you know low crime less gangs
all those things
so let's assume that they've figured out
how to organize
in a way that's successful so this kid
has a complete way to go there
likewise let's say you're you're a
family
you're a family member of a real
successful family but you're the
you know you're the one who didn't quite
do as well as the your siblings
you might want to say you know this
whole
working hard and you know trying to
compete against these geniuses and
that's just not for me
so you would have the complete option to
go
to some place where you just feel more
comfortable it's like yeah
i don't mind working but you know i
don't like all the
drama of it i just want to you know do
my work help my community
live in peace or maybe that you're an
addict maybe you're an addict
so an addict might want to go where
there's the best treatment
friendliest situation i'm not sure which
side that would be
but anyway you you'd have ability to
move then you would have non-traditional
family units
i didn't want to use the word tribe but
it is the best word
meaning that you wouldn't necessarily
have this little unit of
mom dad and kids they would still exist
but you'd have you know aunts and
friends and uncles and
you know you'd never have to worry about
help you never have to worry about child
care
because it would just be a big extended
family essentially
now they could organize any way they
want but this these are the broad
strokes obviously the laws would have to
be at least a little bit compatible with
the constitution
of the united states because they
couldn't have their own supreme court
now where would it be
where would this hypothetical equality
land
be where would it be here's my
suggestion
a network of bicycle paths around the
country
and you turn the country the united
states into a bicycle
tourism mecca so that riding these
trails are it's not just possible to
ride the trails
it's really fun there's you know there's
greenery
there's something to see there are
places to stop all along the way
there's campsites there are hotels there
are places made for bicycles
there's a place to get a bite to eat and
some water just all the way
along the thing you've got to do you've
got to build these you've got to do the
maintenance on them
you've got a lot of work from hotels to
restaurants to
bicycle repair bicycle rental bicycle
you know pick up from the road when you
get a flat tire
so a network of bicycle paths would
create the necessity
for an enormous amount of low-skilled
labor
an enormous amount and the beauty of
this is if you wanted to go to
let's say live along the path
it's being along the path that is where
the equality society lives
so you could go and live near one of
these paths and if let's say if you
lived in florida
let's say your family was there you
might want to be nearby
so you just you know you'd be within
driving distance but you would live
in equality land and you would be sort
of subject to that
lifestyle and culture now if you did
this you would have an industry that
would be
robot proof that's right it would be
robot proof
because robots wouldn't be as great for
doing this kind of work
and the people in equality land could
just say no robots
no robots we just decided that we won't
have any robots in
equality land which is spread along
these
paths and
and they would not be along highways
because you don't want your bicycling
and your cars to be in the same
place now obviously depending on the
season
there would be different uh parts of the
the bicycle paths
that would be better in different
seasons who is policing the past
who's policing the past would be the the
citizens
of equality bill they would have lights
they would have cameras
they might have humans but the but you
wouldn't be ever too far away from
something civilized
uh and yes and a big part of this idea
is a lot of you know i got an e-bike
recently so it's got a battery that
assists you when you pedal
now if you have not experienced the fun
of riding an electric bike that makes
you feel like you're you have
super strong legs because you always
have to pedal it it doesn't do anything
by itself
but the pedal assist you'll go up hills
like they don't even exist
you know senior citizens can easily
climb hills with his
senior citizen meaning probably through
to your early 70s you could you could go
up hills pretty easily
so that's the basic idea so if you're
just joining me i will recap
the idea is to uh and again it's not a
proposal
it's just for brainstorming reasons you
don't have to love the idea
but think in terms of letting the people
who will never be
comfortable in the dog-eat-dog world of
capitalism and free markets
why not let them have their own piece of
the pie
and they could build something from
scratch that would not be racist
at all now what would be the alternative
well the alternative is we either live
in a country where there's continuous
tension about
systemic racism or we say
how about you show us how to do this
right how about you start
in a fresh situation because
you know if we're being honest most of
the people affected
are people who don't have a lot of
skills because
they've got other problems right the
people have lots of skills
probably doing okay it's sort of
everybody who's below that lots of skill
level
who's got the extra burden of racism
without the benefit of at least i made
some money
all right somebody says that's what
homeless encampments are for
now the the idea here is not
is not to simply put them in some kind
of uh like a native american reservation
all right if you're thinking in terms of
uh it's just like a native american
reservation did that work out
no we're not talking about that i'm
talking about a really well-designed
society from the ground up
using the best knowledge we have and you
don't even do the first
you know you don't even do the first
town along the first
bike bath until you've got something
that looks pretty good
right so you don't have to just say
here's a bunch of land good luck
native americans with your with your
land
you can design it right so you know what
you're getting into before you
go live all right now as you might
imagine there are a billion ways this
can go wrong
we have to compare it to the
alternatives
compare it to the alternatives the
alternatives
are we either fight forever about
socialism and systemic racism because it
doesn't look like our current system can
be tweaked
it just doesn't look like it can i was
uh
i was looking at an announcement from
cornell i think it's
just came out and cornell was talking
about all the things that they were
doing to
address systemic racism it was just page
after page of
this class and this education and we'll
fund this and do this
and it just looks like it will be
too hard to retrofit
something that's so mature you know the
rest of the country
and i i would be perfectly
okay if the country said you know what
if you've got a better idea let's test
it let's test it
we'll give you some space see how it
goes
what about borders in this case the
the uh that's a good question i would
say that
one of the questions would be what to do
with immigration
now because the equality land
likes immigration likes a lot
and so too does the defense land
but they would prefer you know the high
skilled workers
more more so um you could say
that you could have unlimited
immigration into
into these areas as long as people are
let's say tracked
and maybe they have to have a phone with
a tracker on it so they're not they
don't
they don't just immediately leave but it
would be a great place to go
so if you were an immigrant let's say
this let's say you're an immigrant
and if you went with the approval
i guess they wouldn't even need approval
of the people in equality land
that you could just go there you just
couldn't leave there
because you you wouldn't have a free
pass to go to equality land and then
just leave there and go to the rest of
the country now how can you do that
i don't know you know maybe there's some
way to i
i've suggested for a long time that
immigrant
immigrants should have some kind of an
immigrant phone that has special apps
for finding work but also for tracking
them
and for you know making sure that
they're doing what they need to do
so there might be some way to allow
immigration into the worlds where they
want it
and control it more for the worlds where
you know they're really just watching
the dollars
so that's so that's the idea um
it's good to see exactly one person who
said this is great
i've got a feeling this wasn't the kind
of idea that everybody would light up
with
but if you if you have a bicycle it
probably excited you
somebody says once again seniors are not
socialists
well you know what i meant all right no
seniors aren't socialists but you know
what i meant they're
for the most part they're not going to
work
they're receiving money it's not all the
money that they put in
in most cases they're getting most
seniors are getting more from the
government than they ever put in in
social security
so but again everybody's different
there's no one thing you could say about
seniors that would be true oh okay a few
more people are saying it's a good idea
i'm actually gonna
watch some more of the comments because
i have no idea oh some more people love
it
how about that and by the way you could
also have
you know your solar panels all the way
you could have your windmills
i mean you could do a lot of cool stuff
there
yes i do really like my bike i do i'm
sorry if i sound like an e-bike
commercial but if you've experienced it
you would immediately know you're seeing
the future
because those batteries are going to get
better and better and even senior
citizens
will be able to have a wheel trike that
they could go 100 miles
i mean you could go 100 miles on flat
ground well even with a little bit of
hills
if you're 75 years old and you're
willing to sit on a
three-wheeled vehicle with a good
battery in it
you'll just battle yourself 100 miles
and you'll be happy about it
so imagine if you could that going on
vacation
a family vacation how hard is it to go
on a family vacation
raise your hand if it's the worst
freaking thing in the world
why because nobody wants to do the same
stuff
good luck getting all the members of
your family to do any one thing that
they all like
equally well and then what do the kids
say the kids say yeah i'll go on that
vacation with you mom and dad
uh i need to bring a friend
and then it just becomes impossibly
complicated
to satisfy everybody's needs and it's
really expensive
to go on any kind of vacation now
imagine
that your vacation is hey kids
we're going to drive and park next to
the closest
bike bath and we're just going to bike
and we're going to camp
how expensive would it be to bike and
camp
probably be a really good vacation would
the kids like it yeah
the kids can go ahead you don't even
have to wait for them the kids could be
10 miles ahead and playing at the
campsite before mom and dad get there
as long as everything's safe so
we could transform the country into a
tourist a destination we could
fill this thing with with people who
come to love america because they see it
up close and have a good experience
and somebody says your ass won't let you
ride that far i am sure
that we can fix bicycle seats
i'm sure we can do that it hasn't been
done yet but
i feel like we could do it
somebody says equality land sounds like
it would take capitalism to make it work
it would take capitalism to get it going
and it would also
be functionally capitalistic
with whatever rules they wanted because
the people who were working there
in the hotels and the food services
would be getting paid
so they would just have to work out what
that means do they pay taxes
do they share it equally and then
everybody gets upi
let them work it out all right
um somebody says are you an artist or
scientist
uh you've got google
scott you could just move to tucson with
great biking and by the way
there's already plans for a national
bike bicycle path
so if you hear that somebody's already
doing this
i'm aware of it i think maryland is
already complete
so you can ride a bicycle the entire
length of maryland
on their this bicycle path i don't know
how much of it is on roads but some of
it probably
and their plans if they can get it
funded is to connect the entire united
states
but i think one bicycle path would be
great by having a network of them so you
could really
see the country would be amazing i mean
how would you like to know
that you could ride your e-bike to see
mount rushmore
kind of cool right and and somebody
would pick you up if you get a flat tire
you know everything's
organized and friendly all right that's
all i got for you
and i will talk to you in the morning
