buddy gather round
today is the big day or one of the big
days
yeah this is the beginning of my
impeachment trial
i was hoping it wouldn't come to this
but it looks like i'm getting impeached
now it looks like they're impeaching at
least on paper
looks like they're going to impeach
ex-president trump
but i think you know what this is really
about
don't you we'll talk all about it in a
minute
but after the simultaneous sip the best
part of the day
come on can you feel the tingle the
excitement
you know it's coming it's coming and all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker chelsea sign
i can't eat jugger flask a vessel of any
kind i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
that makes
everything better everything it's called
the simultaneous sip
and if you haven't tried it oh i feel
sorry for you
wow what you have missed so far
but you can get in on this now get in on
the non-ground floor go
yeah you thought i was kidding but it
was just as good as you thought it would
be
maybe better all right let's talk about
all the things
do you remember those of you who have
been watching me a while
do you remember that i was uh i was just
complaining like crazy over the summer
and following months about the fact that
the trump administration
was not pursuing these rapid testing
techniques
and there seemed to be some
administrative problem
or something but if you remember my
criticism
it was kind of specific and i said
the weird thing is that they don't even
say why they're not doing it
you know how could it be that this
technique of the rapid testing if you
don't know about it it's using
low-cost really cheap tests that aren't
as accurate
but if you do lots of them because
they're cheap you get a better result
than if you have just a few tests
relatively speaking that are high
quality
because you can't test many people with
a with a high quality stuff
so lower quality testing lots of people
the way the math works is that you would
crush the virus
if you did that now
would any would any anything get through
undiagnosed yeah
yeah that's the whole point about them
being a little bit lower quality
but they would get all of the super
spreaders anybody who had a lot of virus
in them
the ones you have to worry about the
test would probably be sensitive enough
for those
it would only miss the people who
probably weren't spreading anyway
because they didn't have much shedding
that's the way i understand it anyway
so my complaint was not that we weren't
doing
it which is a big question right
like why aren't we doing it but why
wouldn't they even
address it it was like it didn't exist
there were these people on social media
you know michael mina
especially who in myself
so there were enough people talking
about it clearly it was a big topic
but it was like it would just go into
this black hole
of the trump administration and just
needed to hear about it again
so i wondered what that was all about
and maybe we have a hint
now uh andres backhouse tweeted this
this morning
he said apparently there's a story out
now
that when jared kushner and whoever else
was on the task force
was asking i guess it was collins out of
the nih
for information about testing to you
know try to get
a better testing thing going that
and this is almost this will sound like
a joke
this will sound like i just made this up
because i'm the the guy who
who creates the dilbert cartoon so you
think you're gonna think it just sounds
like a dilbert cartoon
the guy who was the ahead of all the
testing
in the nih decided and this is from
himself he's actually saying this now
that he didn't want to draw much
attention
so he gave such a technical nerdy
description
of you know the situation that it made
it impossible to deal with him
what isn't that exactly what it looked
like from the outside
keep in mind that i would be probably
considered one of the
foremost observers of bureaucracies
you know i've been doing the dilbert
cartoon which is about
corporate bureaucracies for 30 years
i know what a bureaucracy does i know
how they act
and when i was looking at this whole why
aren't we getting any kind of a yes
no or this is what you should know about
this rapid testing stuff
i could smell something wrong there and
i was i was telling you this
months ago i just smelled something
wrong and it looks like it's
probably in the guts of the machine not
necessarily
something that was a problem with trump
it was like the machine wasn't working
and now we know why he literally
that this guy literally was stonewalling
his bosses
and making it impossible to deal with
him
intentionally and he's telling you this
right now
so this is what andre said about it he
said so the u.s didn't put more money
into the development of new and expanded
covet testing
because the head of the nih didn't want
it to catch the attention of the white
house
so he intentionally sabotaged the
communication
question mark because that's what it
looks like he said
that's exactly what it looks like
wow so i'll say this again
that doesn't mean that the you know that
trump gets a pass
on this it's his administration right
but if biden fixes this
and it looks like he might that's a
pretty big deal
pretty big deal so i hope he does fix it
um i tweeted this
what do you make of the fact that biden
is going to fire pretty much everybody
in the
all the attorneys and the doj
it's going to fire all of the attorneys
that work for the doj except to his
credit he's not going to get rid of the
um not going to get rid of the
guys looking into the russia collusion
beginnings or the hunter biden
situation so he is so i would consider
that
an ethical and ethical way to go
so i'll give biden credit for not
getting rid of those two things that you
probably would prefer getting rid of
so credit where credit is due but here's
my question
apparently it's fairly traditional to
get rid of the
attorneys in the department of justice
when a new administration comes in
from the other party but what does that
tell you
about the department of justice
if if the attorneys working at the
department of justice
are not perfectly sufficient for any
kind of administration that
takes power isn't the administration
telling us
not to trust them how how else could you
interpret that why would you trust
department of justice lawyers more than
the next administration will trust them
because the next administration is going
to fire them every time
and why are they going to fire them
because they don't trust them
why else they don't trust them
to do their bidding think about that
if our own government doesn't trust
the lawyers in our own department of
justice
why should you trust them i mean it's
basically
a a very clear statement that you should
not trust your own government
how else can you interpret that
seriously how else
can you interpret that other than you
can't trust your own government
they're telling us this is pretty direct
if you can't trust the department of
justice lawyers
you can't trust the government
and we already knew about congress
and it's weird that as far as i know i'm
the only person who's ever brought that
up
you heard anybody else mention that
wouldn't you think that would be the
biggest story in the world
that we can't trust our own government
so we have to fire them when the new
administration comes in
these are people who in theory were not
political
in theory they were supposed to just be
following the law
but apparently our own leaders don't
think they do that otherwise they would
keep them
keep the experience people
so if you're looking to see who might
emerge as
uh the gop front runner to lead the
party in the future
i would say that uh tom cotton is
continuing to stand out
he's called out of a few failures of the
trump administration that i will call
out
as well so this is what tom cotton said
in a tweet he said the
talking about yemen he says the houdis
are armed and trained by iran's overseas
terror corporations terror corps
the irgc and hezbollah
so you talk about biden's decision to
remove their terrorist designation
is repeating the errors of the obama
administration
appeasing iran blah blah blah
now doesn't that seem like a pretty
reasonable tweet
why is it that we're deciding not to
call
a group that's being that's being uh
trained and armed by iran's terrorist
wing and we're we're not going to call
them terrorists
you know i don't know the details of
this situation but it seems like abided
mistake but you'll probably never hear
anything about it except
you know this tweet and then tom cotton
on a different subject said that
notes that more than 80 000 americans
have died from drug overdoses last year
and the biden administration as part of
its immigration changes
said that it won't be deporting illegal
alien cartel members
who deal fentanyl and heroin because
it's not a priority anymore
so it's not a priority to deport
cartel dealers of fentanyl and heroin
who are behind 80 000 american drug
overdose
deaths a year that is a mistake
right tom cotton called it out i didn't
see anybody else call it out
if i if i had to pick a leader of the
republican party today
it would be him because he's calling out
a high important things
that i don't see anywhere else
so here's a question for you can
somebody give me a fact check on this
okay
so i've been making the claim that
we have not we've never done a full
audit of our election system
from end to end where you could see
every vote
and how it you know got to the final
tally and you could know
that nothing happened with hacking and
you know any kind of mischief but
the counterpoint to me has been this and
i would like you to fact check this
the counter point is this there have
been
recounts so in georgia for example there
there was
at least in one county i guess a recount
and in other places if you were to do
selected
and here's the key word selected
recounts
in places where you thought there might
be an issue or places that were
close if you only did selected recounts
and you match the the physical ballots
to whatever the machine said
in that in that uh precinct i guess
and you knew that the paper ballots and
the digital account
were roughly the same you know give give
or take two or three votes usually
would you say that you have now done at
least a
representative enough it wouldn't be an
actual
you know random selection uh but it
would be better than that
because you would be targeting the ones
that you suspected are highly likely to
have
some mischief if there's going to be any
so if you did target them
and you did match the the physical
ballots
with the count for just that area would
that be enough of a representative
sampling
because you're you know it's not really
representative but you know what i mean
better than representative
because they're looking for places that
might have a trouble
would that give you a full check all the
way to the final
vote and so i see some no's
and i see some yeses
why don't we know that shouldn't we as a
public
know the answer to that question because
if the answer is
yes that that's really all you need to
know
and if it's true that those likely
problem areas were recounted
and that count got all the way to the
final count
that would make me feel very comfortable
that you had
wait for it an unhackable system
to me that would be unhackable because
as long as
um somebody could you know reasonably
request a recount in places that were
maybe problematic
i feel like that would catch any serious
mischief i mean they'd have to be really
clever
but if you don't do it in the key areas
where you know the electoral college
makes a big difference
if you're not doing it in those areas
it's probably doesn't matter if you're
doing it anyway
so um
let me see all right so i'm somebody's
mentioning mail in ballots but i think
they would be part of a recount
the you would just recount the mail-in
ballots with the other ballots
um if it's paper ballots without the
digital
part there's still a place where you
enter it into the digital system
so nothing is ever non-digitized
in the end somebody says you're simply
verifying the machines
but um
so let me let me be a little more clear
a
a a recount would not catch any mischief
that happened with the ballots
themselves
because if they got counted once they
would just be counted again
so it wouldn't catch that kind of fraud
but
my my specific question is i guess i
should be more clear about that
is would it catch any possible hacking
or software problem would it be enough
to catch
all of that even if it didn't catch
anything that happened with physical
ballots hypothetically
can somebody tweet me something that
would answer that question
because don't you think that's a really
important question
how comfortable would you be
if you thought that there was you know
few recounts did actually get traced all
the way through the digital system to
the end
i would feel a lot more comfortable and
i would think it would be hard to
to cheat with software if we had done
even those limited audits that's what i
would think
so somebody cleared me up on that i
figured that's that's a gigantic
question
and i should know the answer to it and
so should you
um this week it looks like congress
isn't even going to pretend to serve the
public
and it's amazing that we let them get
away with that it's just amazing
and does anybody really think the public
will be served
in any way by the other business of the
congress being
postponed such as the stimulus package
it seems pretty important
um but they're not even pretending
they're just not even pretending to do
the people's work
this is so clearly political meaning
that they're trying to prevent
you know trump from being what uh
running again
i guess that is just laughably
blatantly incompetent in terms of doing
the job you were hired
you know or elected to do it's just
amazing that we let them get away with
this
amazing um
but i'd like to i'm going to talk about
the capital riot a little bit
and i'll need to do a special aside for
dumb people
most of you watching this have normal or
above normal intelligence
but just in case anybody snuck in
i need to do a special service
announcement
for the dumb people if there are any i
know this is a smart audience
but if you wouldn't mind if if you have
average or above average intelligence
if you could just hold on for a minute
because i want to make a message
directly to the dumb people here we'll
turn the camera a little bit this way
okay all right so smart people just talk
among yourselves this is just for the
dumb people
all right dumb people when you hear me
talking about
the capital riots and i talk in terms of
the president not inciting violence
what wouldn't make sense for you to say
is that there are victims what about the
people who died and see this is what the
dumb people don't understand that
the people who are talking among
themselves probably get
people like me who have normal or above
normal intelligence automatically
think the victims of every situation
matter
i know weird right we automatically
assume that's important we automatically
have empathy for the
families and for anybody who was injured
or killed
every time now you're probably thinking
well not every time right
no actually surprisingly every time
you you won't even find an exception
every single time
anybody dies i sort of wish it hadn't
happened
you know with maybe some exceptions of
serial killers and dictators and stuff
like that
but generally speaking dumb people and
we'll get back to the smart people in a
minute
but for the dumb we always consider that
i know it's surprising all right i just
wanted to
set you up with that so that you don't
get worked up
about anything else i say about the
impeachment or the
the capital situation are we good dumb
people all right we're going to get back
i'm going to talk to the smart people
again so
i hope we're good on that right
all right smart people uh i'm back
i hope you hope you had a nice break
there i think the dumb people are on
board now and now we can talk about the
topic
um so
everybody knows that uh i hope you know
that
there are not many people who say that
president trump
handled the capital riot assault
whatever you want to call it well
is there anybody making that case
because uh democrats will
argue with me that somehow i'm defending
the way he handled it
i'm not defending the way he handled it
i think he should be criticized for the
way he handled it
now whether you impeach him or not is
you know whether you want to be silly
and do something absurd and useless and
unproductive for the country
that's a different question but did he
handle it right no i think that
i think that he could have done more as
it was unfolding
he could have just probably ended it
with a tweet
and i think he should have done that but
the specific question
of whether using the words
uh you know fight for whatever a
transparent election
or uh calling for a peaceful protest
whether that is inciting violence
among the people who have viking hats
and plastic ties
that's kind of a stretch that's kind of
a stretch
but we're we're going to endure this
anyway
and it appears now that you can be
punished in this country at least in the
united states
probably in other countries too you can
be punished
for other people's absurd
interpretations of your opinions
so it used to be that you would get
punished for things that you did
things that you said maybe your actual
opinion
but we're not in those days anymore now
you will be punished in a variety of
ways
for other people's absurd interpretation
of what you meant and you can be
punished by
a social media ban cancellation
impeachment
boycott and loss of job for other
people's
misinterpretation of what you said
now i was asked by some people if i
could do a micro lesson
i'm doing little micro lessons in the
locals
platform locals.com this is subscription
service
so i've got a whole bunch of lessons and
little two-minute videos of
things to make you more effective and
people ask me scott
how do we identify a conspiracy theory
or
fake news you know how do you identify
it how do you know what's fake and
what's real
and i'm going to give you a little mini
lesson on that now
here's how to tell what is fake and what
is real
if somebody tells you that the president
of the united states
went on tv and praised in direct
language
neo-nazis as fine people
how do you know that didn't happen
or do you think it did happen
here's how you know it did not happen
that didn't happen
you don't really have to overthink that
how do you know that the president of
the united states any president
including trump how do you know that
they didn't go on tv
and praise neo-nazis in direct language
and called them fine people
how do you know that didn't happen
because nothing like that would ever
 happen in in no in no universe
would that ever happen well
let's do another one
uh cnn has said a number of times that
president trump
suggested drinking bleach as a possible
uh solution for coronavirus
now how do you know and and other and
other reporting says
injecting disinfectants which they
interpret to mean household cleaners
how do you know the president of the
united states didn't go on live tv
and suggest drinking bleach
or injecting household cleaners
into your body to fight a virus how do
you know that didn't happen
or do you think it did let me tell you
how to know it didn't happen that didn't
 happen
that's it don't overthink it that didn't
 happen
because in no universe would that ever
happen
it's a flying unicorn it's a
it's a black hole opened up on tv it's
it's magic you don't have to know a lot
about the details or look behind it
or get under the hood or really
investigate it
you just look at it and say to yourself
well that didn't happen
that's it that's the whole technique if
you can't do that
you're not really understanding much of
the news
let me give you another one did the
president of the united states
intentionally incite violence
at the capitol a violent overthrow or
insurrection of the united states
do you think he did that there's an
impeachment trial about that
do you think that actually happened
let me tell you why you know it didn't
happen
here's why that didn't happen
no because it didn't happen in any
universe
in the entire simulation if if there are
if there are infinite universes as some
people theorize it didn't happen in any
of the universes
because it couldn't happen it's absurd
it's ridiculous on its surface
all right let me give you let's see if
you've learned anything we'll give you a
test
i'm going to give you two statements and
you have to figure out which one of
these
didn't happen and you have to use the
same standard
you just have to look at it and say well
that didn't happen
that's it that's that's the whole
technique here are two examples
yesterday i walked my dog
that statement number one and you'll you
get to decide
is that potentially true you don't know
if it's true
but is it potentially true or would you
say of that
that didn't happen
in the comments true people say yeah
now it happens it was true it was true
but at the very least
it was maybe true wouldn't you agree
maybe i didn't walk the dog yesterday
but it was in the category of things
that could be maybe true
maybe it was true all right here's my
second statement
i went out in the backyard and i flapped
my arms
so hard that for two minutes or so
i was able to hover over the ground
like a birds or like a hummingbird now
the trick of it is
that you have to flap really hard if you
didn't flap hard enough well you're not
going to get any height at all
but i went in the backyard i flapped my
hands really hard and i managed to hover
above the ground for two minutes now
here's your test
apply the standard of did that really
happen
go uh-huh
uh-huh i'm looking at your comments
somehow
somebody says i believe you it's true
stop lying
all right here's how you should have
solved that puzzle
when i told you i flapped my arms until
i hovered across the ground
this should have been the entire mental
process
that didn't happen that's it
that's it so you have to learn that
believe it or not you have to learn that
because a lot of
a lot of the world was swallowing the
the q
stuff and and every every you know the
russia collusion stuff
and did you you know what you should
have said to all of the q stuff
that's not true
that's it you don't need some kind of an
insight to know that these things are
not true
it doesn't take any insight at all to
know these are not
true all right
um alan dershowitz has some uh smart
thoughts about the impeachment trial so
he's got
three constitutional reasons that it's
bogus now i don't think anybody cares
about the constitutionality of this do
they do you think that the senate
cares one bit about whether it's
constitutional
no do you think the democrats care
if they're following constitutional
norms no
no do you think that whether or not it
was constitutional the
republicans are going to vote a
different way than you already know
they're going to vote
no no so it really doesn't matter
if it's constitutional or not it really
doesn't
because it's a political process they
can just pretend it is if they had
enough people to pretend it is
then then you know there's a conviction
i guess if that's what you call it
um so it's irrelevant
but the arguments are interesting number
one dershowitz says
the senate has no jurisdiction over an
ex-president
so they can do anything they want but
they don't have any jurisdiction
it would be sort of like the the boy
scouts of america or the scouts of
america whatever they're called now
uh trying to put you in jail
the scouts are not a legal process they
can't put you in jail
so even if if the pta has a trial
and finds you guilty it doesn't really
matter because the pta doesn't have any
authority over you
so that's a pretty good argument the
senate has no jurisdiction
the other is that free speech is
protected so whatever the president said
even if the outcome of that was uh some
violence
it's still free speech so you know
that's the end of the story
and then the third one's a little more
technical there's
uh i guess part of the constitution says
congress shall make no law
and that includes any action as
dershowitz explains
abridging the freedom of speech so if
congress punishes
trump for his speech
his freedom of speech they would be
doing exactly what the constitution
specifically says they can't do so you
wouldn't even have to
interpret the constitution it says it
directly
it says congress shall make no law and
then i guess you would have to interpret
the part about or other actions because
it's
it's unclear on that abridging the
freedom of speech
so those are pretty good arguments but
they're irrelevant to impeachment i
think
if you wanted to here's a little tip for
you if you're a democrat and you want to
disguise the fact that you're a
brainwashed
fake news believing revenge puppet
and that what you really want is to
punish trump supporters
that's what you really want but you want
to hide that
and and look like you're a serious
citizen
who cares about the well-being of the
republic so if you'd like to disguise it
the best way to do it
is to go on social media and declare
that
trump's public call for peaceful
protests
for better election transparency
is really inciting a violent coup
involving a viking hat and plastic ties
so if you can sell to people the idea
that asking for a peaceful protest for
better election transparency
is inciting a coup and that that coup
was a plan to hold the government to the
united states
using nothing but a viking hat and some
plastic ties
and capturing an empty room and that was
their plan
to overthrow the greatest military in
the world
and and uh and hold the government
so let me ask you
this i i taught you now how to identify
from actual news let me uh
let me give you another example and
we'll test it again
and remember the only thinking you have
to do is
well that didn't happen or
the opposite which is yeah it might have
happened you don't know if it happened
usually but it might have
were there people who were quite
serious about overthrowing the actual
legal government and
ignoring the constitution and they
thought that they could take over
and hold the government or change
change who was in charge via the process
of entering a building that was
otherwise empty
with nothing but some uh i guess some
clubs
some umbrellas a viking hat
and some plastic ties
was it their plan now they're i'm sure
that there were people who had
you know concealed carry as well but was
it their plan
to actually hold the government
like an actual coup and control it
with their viking hat their plastic ties
a few guys who had concealed carry
probably
but did not brandish them
was that actually really happening
well i would apply the standard
that didn't happen
that didn't happened there was
no attempted
coup if it had been an attempted coup
it would have looked a lot different
because
nobody nobody
is so dumb that they think that they
could have taken over the government of
the united states
by taking over an empty room in the
capitol
with their plastic ties and their viking
horns
and taking selfies that's not even close
to a coup
that's not in the zip code of a coup
that's not in the solar system
of a coup that's not in the milky way
of a coup so if you're looking at that
and trying to say
is this real apply this standard
that didn't happen
is bigfoot rummaging through your
refrigerator downstairs
right now is he
that's not happening see this
standard works for everything
it will clear up quite a bit i think for
you all right
those are my comments for today uh
remember that
uh periscope will be going away so one
of these days
soon um i will only be on youtube
so you might want to make the transition
quickly because it's the same content
you still have commenting
and it's just on youtube so you
periscopers probably
might want to get used to youtube right
away
because it'll be the only game in town
pretty soon
although the locals platform will have
streaming
sometime in the coming weeks we hope at
least in
in beta all right
uh why not go to haps
okay uh did you hear that uh
the clubhouse app where i guess it's
audio only and people can talk
got banned in china china isn't even
pretending
anymore ivermectin
somebody asked well ivormectin appears
to be one of these things
that people on social media talk about
as working
but the medical community as a whole
is not embracing and who knows why
uh is haps a thing h-a-p-p-s
uh rumble oh yeah you know rumble has
live does rumple have live streaming
they didn't have live streaming a while
ago
all right just looking at your comments
for a moment start your own platform
well i wonder if trump will start a
platform or if he'll do a rollup
you know here's what trump should do
so you've got you've got your rumbles
and your gabs and your
parlors and your few other things
maybe he should just roll up two or
three of them
under one brand and make it some other
kind of
social media the problem is if trump
starts a social media platform
it's going to attract pretty much
exclusively
you know the the same crowd that
supported him
so you know nothing's going to be as
good as say a twitter would be
for showing both sides you know if you
took all of the
uh all the trolls and critics and
democrats away from twitter
i don't know if i would even be there
because if he can't hear both sides
what's the point really
so that's the problem with the uh the
new
the rogue social media sites is that
they're not going to attract
both sides and if they can't do that
they don't really have a product
in my opinion that will be a problem all
right
somebody saying twitter co-opted
periscopes functions so you can still
broadcast
on twitter i don't know the details of
that
i think that you are roughly correct
that twitter will have
some built-in process that may
be a partial or full substitute for
periscope
if that's the case uh i may use it
but we'll see but i have to wait and see
what that's all about first
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
all right youtubers you're here for
another minute
uh dilbert's new company needs to
develop the new platform hey that's a
good idea
someone hacked a water plant in florida
that's dangerous
did i see dr simone gold's conference on
the dangers
dr simone gold is
once you become the skeptic i don't
believe anything you say anymore
so the the medical skeptics who are
skeptical about one thing
and then they move to a new thing to be
skeptical about
i immediately just say oh i get it
they're they're trying to be the
skeptical person
and they lose all credibility frankly by
the time they go to the second
skeptical thing even if they're right
when i talk about credibility i mean
you know how how real does it look not
how real is it
uh have you heard the name of the dc cup
who shout
ashley babbitt i haven't
and i think the point you're trying to
make is that
if it had been a white cop who shot a
black
citizen that we would know the name of
the cop but if it was a white cop who
shot
this trump supporter that we don't hear
the name of the cop
but we do know that the cop is not going
to be charged
because it was judged that it was a good
shooting
good meaning good in quotes obviously
there's nothing good about it
but i would agree that the the officer
should not be charged
based on what i saw on video what i saw
in the video did look like
he had to do what he had to do all right
on the um yeah
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
