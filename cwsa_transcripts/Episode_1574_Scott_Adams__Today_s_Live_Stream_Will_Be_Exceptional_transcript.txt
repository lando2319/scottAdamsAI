good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened to
you
yeah i know that's a big claim but i'm
going to back it up
by the end of this live stream you're
going to say to yourself wow that might
have been the best thing that's ever
happened to me
and you've had sex
so that's how good it is
now if you'd like to make it extra extra
good
what would you do that's right that's
right you all got it right you'd have
the simultaneous sip and all you'd use a
copper mug or glass of tanker jealous to
sign a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better except
shopping it's called the simultaneous
sip happens now go
yeah
yeah that's good
well happy black friday as the racists
call it
i call it all day friday
or all people friday yeah
it's it's all people friday
because it turns out that you're allowed
what was that
something bad just happened
anyway it turns out that you're allowed
to shop today even if you're not black
so it's called black friday
but it turns out everybody can shop
which i feel is very open-minded
so happy all people friday
um
i don't know if i told you
my play
with rob reiner's tweet
and it's a play that i use a lot now you
know how
that the left and the right are in their
own news bubbles
and social media bubbles they don't see
much from the other side
so if you're trying to
if you're trying to persuade the other
side
how do you do it
something very loud happening outside my
house
doesn't sound good
i don't know what it is but there's
heavy equipment right outside my house i
hope nobody called the wrecking crew
that is a terrible prank by the way
never hire a wrecking crew for your
neighbor's house
somebody actually did that prank once
anyway
my play with rob reiner's tweet in which
he said
he had a bunch of stuff wrong about the
written house case he said in november
23rd now remember by november 23rd
the entire country should know the
actual story
of written house
well listen how bad his version was and
i'll add something to what i've said
before about this
an underage kid illegally took an
assault rifle across state lines
nope
nope
didn't take it across
across state lines and it wasn't illegal
and that's why there were no charges
now there were charges that were dropped
but by the time they went to a verdict
there were no charges about any gun
related thing now how could you not know
that
well you'd have to be in a pretty deep
bubble right
now i saw some people saying oh they
know it
they know the gun wasn't illegal they're
just saying that
no
no they really don't know
the the level of um
ignorance
that let me be fair it's on both sides
left and right the level of ignorance
that both sides have about each other's
news
is really shocking
and if you don't think that's the whole
story here
you think that they're just lying and of
course they know the real story i don't
think so
i would place a very large bet
that when rob reiner wrote this tweet he
did not know the actual story
because their news doesn't report it
well it does report it but it reports it
inaccurately
so let me tell you my play here my play
is not to embarrass rob reiner because i
don't care about him individually
and my play is not to convince a whole
bunch of
people on the right because they already
got the correct news
so how do i reach the people on the left
well here's my hypothesis and i think
it's
fairly accurate
which is that blue check twitter people
kind of pay attention to the other blue
checks
am i right
now if you don't have a blue check next
to your name you may not have
experienced this
but i can tell you that i regularly
i look at all i try to look at most of
my comments
but on top of that
uh i also try to look at
uh
there's somebody at my door and i'm
gonna have to figure out what's going on
here because something big is happening
right outside my door right now
sorry i better check on this see if it's
anything important
uh
i'll show you what it is
it's a it's a bird sitting in front of
my security camera
so there's a
there's that bird
there's one bird today that walks i
think it's the same bird he just walks
in front of my security camera every day
all right so i'm not being attacked
now i'm a little i'm a little bit extra
cautious
because my neighborhood's been hit with
a crime wave of you know people
literally breaking through a window and
carrying your stuff away while you're
home
so it's a dangerous neighborhood at the
moment
anyway my play with rob reiner is to get
him to see my comment because i'm a blue
check and to see if i can break through
and
here's what i want him to to feel
i don't need him to be embarrassed i
don't need him to
tweet something different
i want him to look at my tweet and say
there's somebody with a blue jack
who has different news for me and he's
saying it right out loud
maybe i should look at this
and see which one of us is wrong
so that's the play
i'm trying only to convince rob reiner
that his news is wrong i'm not even
trying to change his opinion
so there's no no politics in it i'm just
trying to convince people that they're
watching fake news
that i think is doable
i think that's doable especially with
the written house case it's like the
as i said it's like the rosetta stone
for unlocking all the fake news on the
left
all right well the washington post
uh
as dinesh d'souza points out the
washington post is uh
quote uh working hard to deny human
agency to black criminals this is
dinesh's take on it about waukesha and
you've seen this right
where the news is talking as if the suv
driven by a black man
which unfortunately matters in 2021 you
have to say the ethnicity because we're
all talking about it right
shouldn't matter but does
and
uh the this is how the washington post
described part of that it said quote the
suv then drove down main street
well by itself
the the suvs have gone rogue now they're
they're killing people on their own
well i don't think so i think there was
a person who drove the car
and a person drove down the street in
his suv
and when you see how much torture they
have to give themselves to write a
sentence like that
you know something's happening right
something's at the breaking point
you can almost feel it
by the way do you feel it
you could feel it when uh ahmed arbury's
father
who you would imagine would be saying
something like black lives matter
because his son was was killed
he said all lives matter and he made a
big deal about it in public all lives
matter period i don't want anybody's
father to have to
you know go through what i'm going
through
and
i feel as if
you know the longer trump is out of the
news
that the realization that
especially on the left that they've been
completely duped by their news and by
their own party
i feel like people are catching on now
so you know the rob reiner tweet i give
him a little nudge
uh but there are a whole bunch of nudges
going on here and it feels like people
are starting to see it but the best
comment about this suv driving down the
street
came from
twitter user jill
who asked this question
who invented the suv
clearly they're the responsible party
here i mean
i don't think a minivan would do this
hmm good point
suvs can be bastards we all know that
um sometimes when you're sleeping the
suv will just take off
party all night come back with less gas
than you knew you had
and uh the suvs are really well-known
bad boys
but the minivans
well the minivans are sort of the
the nerds of the automotive world
very efficient
very well designed for utility but your
minivan is never going to
steal the money from your wallet and go
on a joyride on its own but an suv no
suvs are bastards
you know
all right i have an suv
ever since i heard about this
incident
uh
i have to put blocks on the wheels at
night
because i don't know what that damn
thing's doing when i'm not watching
so all right next story um
wall street journal editorial board
uh just went viciously at biden
and i love this attack i usually don't
like to call out the hypocrisy stuff
because if you do that that's all you're
talking about
because the political parties don't
really try too hard
you know to do what they say you should
do
so it's usually just you know sort of
boring and trite to call that out but
this is this is a big and unusual case
because
biden's uh
proposition was you can't have a
president who has allowed this many
people to die on his watch meaning covet
but biden's death count has surpassed
trump's
and that's after the vaccination
now
am i going to tell you that trump did a
better job
than biden
nope
i am not going to tell you that because
i told you from the beginning of the
pandemic
and i'm the only one
if anybody would like to fact check this
i'm making a a very big claim here
that i'm the only one who told you at
the beginning of the pandemic
that leadership would not be a variable
that
would be predictive
did anybody else tell you that
i don't think one person told you
that you will not see a leadership
variable that that's obvious
now there may be some extreme cases of
maybe some i don't know
third world country that
thought it was caused by aids or
something so yeah i mean in the extreme
case yes but i don't think you're going
to tell the difference between great
britain and france
france and the united states
i just don't think you're going to be
able to tell the difference leadership
wise some will do better than others but
we still don't know why
we just don't know why
so
um i would say that biden has no chance
if you know even if he imagined he was
going to run for office i can't imagine
he is
but he couldn't possibly get elected
having failed at the number one thing he
said he'd do
number one thing biden said he'd do
is get the pandemic under control
nothing like that happened
350 000 people died under biden compared
to 200 000 220 or so under trump it's
not even close
and again
biden had the vaccinations
now does that mean anything no it just
you know of course more people die
at the peak of the pandemic
of course they do had nothing to do with
biden
and if trump had been president probably
the same outcome
probably the same
you could you could do a mental
experiment where you say hey
there are lots of uh conservatives not
getting the vaccine
so maybe maybe trump could have
convinced them
whereas biden could not
i doubt it
i doubt it
this did seem to be the limit of
trump's
persuasion you know i think he's
tremendous at persuading as you know
but i don't think he made a dent
in the conservatives who were
you know concerned about the vaccination
let me let me give some comfort to the
vaccine deniers
because i'm you know anytime that i'm
accused of you know not
being fair about each side's perspective
i like to correct that when i can
here's what i hate
about the anti-vaxxers the skeptics
about the vaccines
i absolutely hate this
that their reasons
are really good
i hate that
yeah and and you and of course the
anti-vaxxers will give you lots of you
know arguments but they have one
argument
that i can't refute
do you know what it is what's what's the
anti-vaxx argument that i can't refute
which one is it no no natural immunity
is part of the part of this story so but
that's not what i'm talking about
and now not not inflammation not
long-term effects nope
it's no nothing about your autonomy your
personal choice those are all good
arguments by the way i'm saying that
that's not the bit the good one
the fda
pfizer
you know big pharma
you have a lot of reasons don't you
i would say those are all worth
discussing
everything you're mentioning here is
absolutely on the list
should be part of the conversation
but the anti-vaxxers have one argument
that i've got nothing for now here it is
can't trust the government
that's a killer argument
can't trust the government
what are you going to
say you tell me you have an argument
against that
can't trust the government
now you say yourself wait a minute wait
a minute it's not really the government
because they're getting their data from
somebody else they're getting it from
big from big pharma
who trusts big pharma
they are by their nature something you
can't trust doesn't mean they're doing
bad things all the time i mean they have
some history of doing some very bad
things
but they're not you know it's not a
criminal organization or anything
they're obviously doing good things as
well
i have to make an aside here i'm sorry
everybody who's calling rob reiner a
meathead
i don't know who he needs to hear this
but it's not additive
it's not funny
it's not something we hadn't thought of
on our own
you're just using
letters on a screen
nothing is accomplished by that
statement that rob reiner is a meathead
or any version of it that i saw
thousands of yesterday well you know
he's a meathead he's always been a
meathead
but have i mentioned that he's a
meathead
i want to be as clear as this as
possible
it's not funny
it's never been funny and there's
nothing you can do to it they'll make
that a good comment
right
now if you were the only one who thought
of it
i'd say oh that's that's a good point
nobody came to this conclusion that he
had a character he played famously
called the meathead if you were the only
one
oh okay that might be additive
but you do know everybody's saying it
right
like hundreds and hundreds of people are
saying you know he's a meathead
i'm just saying
please
please can you help me stop reading that
comment
you know you have a right to make it of
course
i'm just saying that it wears on me like
few things do
i don't want to hear soil in green i
don't want to hear what's like the
matrix
and i don't want to hear that rob reiner
is a meathead because those are the most
obvious things that anybody could say
about anything
all right
um so i was saying about uh yeah biden's
done a bad job here
but uh leadership is not predictive now
apparently the united states has warned
russia
that if they're behind the i'm changing
the topic here if russia is behind this
so-called
havana syndrome sonic weapon
that
uh that they would pay for that
apparently there are a number of havana
syndrome cases
happening
related to russian embassies and others
etc so now i think there are hundreds of
cases of this
what was my prediction on day one
you will never find a secret
uh sonic weapon
that's behind it all now there might be
something that's behind it all might be
some kind of
you know electronics that are common to
i don't know
embassies that have some sonic problem
to them or something but i think i'm
also the only person in the country who
predicted that am i right
i didn't hear anybody else in the
country predict
that you would never find the sonic
weapon
haven't found it yet
so i like to talk about my uh my
predictions that no one has made
uh all right
uh i have to talk about this again
because it came on the slow news
thanksgiving day but there is a new
study saying that the arctic ocean began
warming decades earlier than previously
thought
now to be clear
this new information does not debunk
climate change in the sense of its
direction
and it doesn't debunk it in terms of
humans causing it
it does however completely debunk
the science
so the reality might be that the earth
is warming people are causing it
maybe we need to do something about it
right that seems to be the case and my
current
my current best guess
because i'm not a scientist
is that probably humans are warming
because i think that's something you
could study
i think you could do it in a lab you
could study it a million times and you
could find out
the co2 has that effect
seems reasonable
which is different from saying that the
science is right
right because there's a lot of science
but just that one minor thing whether
co2 makes warming or not i think they
got that right
we don't know how fast how much how much
has been in the past how much we have to
worry about those are all different
questions but this new study if it
stands
and it might not you know maybe it gets
debunked tomorrow but if it were to
stand
would show that all the models are
completely wrong
sort of a big deal
there's no way the models could even be
close to correct if this study is is
right because it says the warming
started way before
you know the the largest amount of
industrial stuff happened by people
um
humans put off heat well maybe
you mean the human causation part
i don't know what you're debunking there
but let me let me go on
so
um
it puts the
the believers in climate science in it
kind of a bind
because if this study is right it means
that everything that they thought about
climate change
at least the the modeling part of it
just the modeling part was wrong
but
if it's not true
that means climate science is not true
because
this is also done by science right
so if it turns out that this science is
wrong what other science is wrong
so you can even either doubt the the
models or you can doubt
climate science itself it's a real
problem and i don't hear anybody else
talking about it do you
have you heard anybody else talking
about this study and what it does to the
entire body of
you know climate science modeling yeah i
think it's just going to disappear as a
topic
all right here's my provocative thought
of the day apparently
we're hearing the reports especially
from the uk but i think it would be true
in america
that there's just this huge problem of
sexual abuse of women in the military
now
not going to make light of that nobody
should
but
i am very bothered
by not just the fact that it's you know
a brutal crime
so i'm not just bothered by that
i'm bothered by the fact that correct me
if i'm wrong but the women in the
military are are trained to kill are
they not
they don't they don't separate the women
and say oh you you know you can learn to
cook
isn't everybody in the military trained
to kill
am i wrong about that
is there any exception to that
i think they all they all use firearms
they're all trained in it
i mean at different levels right marines
are trained to kill really hard
but everybody's trained to kill
or at least defend themselves am i right
so here's my problem if you put somebody
in the military or they join the
military you train them to kill people
who deserve to be killed
i think they should have special
dispensation to be able to kill their
sexual accusers
or abusers not accusers
i think a woman in the military should
be able to hunt down
and murder
a sexual abuser even if it's next week
or next year
now in a practical sense you could never
have that law right i'm aware of that
but
i feel like it would be justice
if we're going to train people to kill
and we're training to kill people who
deserve to be killed
and they meet one of these people who
deserves to be killed right up close
i say they can kill them in their sleep
i'm okay with that
don't train people to kill and then rape
them and don't expect them to kill the
person who raped them
that's not fair
either don't train them to kill
or let them kill
because some people are worth killing
all right
um that's not a serious point but um
it could be
lauren uh bobert
is it beau bert or bobert she's got a
bert at the end of her name so i'm
automatically uh i like her because of
you know dilbert dogbert beaubert
anyway
so she uh she's on film telling an elon
omar story that elon omar says never
happened but the story as lauren says is
that elon omar who as you know would be
in traditional islamic garb
according to this story which omar says
never happened omar was getting in an
elevator and lauren wilbur saw
the security
all worried about a threat and running
toward the elevator
and didn't get there in time
and then bobert allegedly said but we
think maybe it didn't really happen that
she said don't worry
she doesn't have a backpack
you know meaning that she's not a
not an islamic terrorist bomber
and people are saying this is a horrible
horrible horrible
and
i would agree that it was probably dumb
for her to tell this joke so i'm not
going to defend the joke but i would
just put this one little
question to it
was it
was it a joke
about elon omar
or was it a joke about the security
guard
i'm not so sure
right because
the joke
was sort of about the security guard
being a bigot and imagining that she was
a terrorist
it wasn't about lauren bober imagining
she was a terrorist and her joke you
know she didn't have a backpack so
you're okay
it doesn't sound like she believed that
she was a terrorist obviously she
doesn't
it's kind of one of these weird ones i
if somebody says a joke at the expense
of the the person
like
omar well that would feel a little
racist depending on the joke of course
but if the joke is about
is about how someone else was racist
against them
i'm not sure i'd take that the same
just put that scalpel down am i cutting
it too too finely
well it's my job jokes are my job
i do look at them
kind of analytically
all right i have an algorithm for you
and i know this will be helpful a way to
determine which
graphs you see on twitter
about ivermectin
solving
a country's problem
to tell which one of some are true
because we've seen the graph
um i've seen a graph that said as soon
as ivermectin was introduced
covent in japan went to nothing
and some other places as soon as
ivermectin was introduced
went to nothing
do you know how to tell which of those
stories are uh fake and which are not
the answer is all of them are fake yeah
every one of the country graphs that
says ivermectin was introduced doesn't
matter if it's india
they're all fake they've all been
debunked
now
did you just hear me say that i debunked
the effectiveness of ivormectin
did i say that
did i just tell you that ivermectin
doesn't work
no
now i told you that the graphs
that show it cured some country are all
fake 100 of them
i've seen everyone i've seen everyone
debunked i doubt you'll see a real one
now
does that tell you anything
about the effectiveness of vibramectin
maybe
maybe not there is one view that says
that the pharma companies are so strong
they could make every single country bow
to their will
or at the very least
get you know the the big countries
medical communities just about to their
will and then the smaller countries
would say oh crap the united states says
this doesn't work
what are you going to do
because we you know we can't test
ourselves we don't have a good medical
you know industry but the united states
says it works and uk says it works and
they've got good medical staffs
so
so there is one that says that
ivermectin might be working
and yet every single country is afraid
to use it is that possible
maybe
maybe
who debunked it everybody you just have
to look at the original data
in other words you just look at any
original data and it disappears there's
there's no data that suggests that
ivermectin solved any problem
you can't find any original data that
says that okay
so
um
all right
here's my take
the longer we go
with the
the belief that's widespread that
ivormectin does or might work the longer
we go
where no country actually solves its
problem with ivermectin
it's very much less likely it works
because even even if you believe all the
medical experts in every country were
influenced by let's say the united
states or influenced by pharma which
seems unlikely to me
you'd have to think with all the
countries in the world and the
desperation
somebody would have actually solved
their entire country's problem with
ivermectin if it worked
am i wrong
you don't think that one country
somewhere would have totally solved
their pandemic
or how about this
if ivermectin worked as well as the
anecdotal reports
you don't think that a hospital would
have noticed by now
a hospital a hospital that does nothing
but coven patients they wouldn't have
obviously noticed that
because you know what they do obviously
notice
regeneron
i'll bet you could go to any hospital
that does a lot of covet and say have
you noticed on your own
the regeneron is bringing people back to
life who maybe seemed like they'd gone
too far
i would bet a hundred percent of
hospitals would say oh yeah we see it
every day we give them a regeneron it
totally turns them around
they would see the same thing with
ivermectin
i mean maybe not us because it's sort of
a semi-band here but somebody would see
it
you don't think any hospital
any country would have seen the effect
yet
so go back to my uh hydroxychloroquine
predictions uh early on in the pandemic
like ivermectin it looked like it was
anecdotally and there were studies that
suggested it worked
i said
that every month that goes by
where you don't have proof that it works
you have to lower your odds that it
worked
and then you saw every month i would
lower the odds of hydroxychloroquine
working it was down to 30 percent the
last number was 10 percent i think i'd
drop it to
2
now
we've gone so long
that if hydroxychloroquine worked
we would know it
i don't think there's any chance
any chance we wouldn't clearly know it
by now
ivermectin is the same path
can i tell you
ivermectin doesn't work absolutely not
so you're not hearing me say that
but i will say that every day that goes
by you have to lower your estimate
if you're being wise about this
because you would see the signal
somewhere or somebody would see it but
you don't see anybody in an official
role
who sees it
right you see a rogue doctor but do you
see anybody who runs a uh
an icu
have you seen any icu doctors say oh
yeah
we're giving people ivermectin it's just
taking them right off the ventilator
nope
nope
so does ivermectin work i have no idea
but
i can tell you that the longer you go
the less likely it is
cnn has some oh no let's talk about that
next
so apparently the lincoln project uh
they are they're a scrappy bunch of
losers the lincoln project so rick
wilson especially i guess
he's trying to revive this monstrosity
that's been completely
humiliated in the last year or so
and
they're trying to make it a thing to get
trump to be the nominee
so they want trump to be the nominee
even though he's the target of all their
attacks
because uh he once he loses
then it will destroy what's left of
trumpism and that's their real goal
and so this is what rick wilson said
about that strategy he says the people
who think we want trump back in 2024 for
any reason other than killing off his
vile repugnant cult and driving it into
the dustbin of history display the same
failure of imagination they always have
do you think that's why rick wilson is
reviving
the lincoln project which made them all
millions of dollars
huh
is it to make the millions of dollars
that they know they'll make
or
is it to
kill off trump's vile repugnant cult and
drive it into the dustbin of history
which one of those seems
slightly more
likely have i ever mentioned
follow the money
you know i tell you it always works even
when the people involved are not
following the money it still always
works
yeah the the lincoln project grifters
are uh just accusing trump of what they
are uh it's just projection
they are horrible grifters race grifters
really some of the worst people in the
world i would say
uh but they're funny so i'm glad they're
in the news
cnn has a wonderful bit of
fake news here and i'm gonna see if you
can spot it
so i'll tell you what they reported
and then you tell me
what the fake news part is okay
so cnn is reporting that the reason we
don't have more
rapid tests and faster you know why
didn't we have this rapid testing you
know cheap and fast because we did
project warp speed
so don't you think we could also get
rapid tests quickly if we wanted
here's what cnn
says to describe
why
we don't have them
it's because we don't have tests because
there were too many available
and the food and drug administration had
more than 3000 emergency use
authorization applications and didn't
have the resources to get through them
so the reason that we only had one
abbott labs for i don't know months and
months the reason we only had one
is that there were
3 000 others who wanted
but there was not enough fda
resources to test them
so we had to live with just that one for
a long time
that
ladies and gentlemen
is fake news
it's really clever
because what do i keep saying about the
reason we don't have the uh
the rapid tests
what do i keep saying loudly and in
public
corruption
it's obviously corruption i would say at
this point that the corruption
hypothesis
i don't know 95
likely
because if this is the best this is the
best
alibi
that we have
the best alibi from the fda is that
there were too many of them and they
didn't have enough resources
what would you do
if you were the fda
and you didn't have to enough resources
you do have some resources so it's not
like you're not testing anything
you know you are evaluating things but
you can't do three thousand would you uh
say
hey guys let's evaluate all three
thousand things at once with our limited
resources is that the way you'd handle
it
you take your limited resources in the
context of a pandemic
you say huh we'd better we'd better
spread our resources so you got a
thousand at first you say let's look at
them all at the same time
but then it goes to 3 000
and it's too it's too fast to add people
so you say to yourself oh i'll just work
less on the first thousand so i'll have
enough for the uh the extra thousands of
them
is that the way the fda decided to
manage that
now hiring help wouldn't be fast enough
i i have to admit
that staffing up probably would be hard
they should do that too
but probably that wouldn't be a magic
bullet it just feels like it would but
it would take a while to staff up
um
i'm no management expert
but here's what i would have done
i would look at those 3000 applications
and i would say
which ones are the biggest companies
that are likely to be able to produce
this in volume
oh
there are only three of them
and then i would evaluate those three
and i would tell all the other thousands
sorry you have to wait
because it's a pandemic we can't be fair
about this we just gotta
we just have to hope we pick some
winners we'll pick the big companies
that say they they can put the resources
together to produce they've got a track
record of producing
do you think these 3 000
applications were all equal
do you think that anybody looked at
these and said yeah these look all about
the same
no
no
there were some that obviously looked
better than the others
obviously
this this cnn report
is complete
they did not have a problem because too
many people wanted to make the
rapid tests
they didn't do it because they're
corrupt we don't know exactly how i mean
the details are unknown but this is pure
corruption and and the cnn is part of it
now
when i asked you
can you google which pharma companies
advertise on cnn
i was looking for abbott labs
because i don't know if they do
but look for it
is abbott labs do they ever advertise on
cnn i think they do 100 million a year
in advertising maybe more lately
is any of it on cnn i don't remember
seeing an ad from them so maybe not
we know pfizer does we know big farmer
does all the time right
but uh take a look at that
and uh tell me if if cnn is just uh in
on the corruption
and is trying to
develop a cover story why why for why
abbott labs had a monopoly for so long
all right that's all for now
on that topic anyway
have you listened to uh dark horse
podcast uh with uh bret
uh brett and heather um so brett
weinstein
and i guess one of the evidences he
showed about uh
ivor working is that it um
when it was widely available in slovakia
there uh they basically crushed the
virus
so that was one of the evidences for
that
uh but andres backhouse um
he made a sarcastic tweet about that in
twitter banned him because i couldn't
tell his parody from from his actual
opinion
his 2021
you got to be careful about your parody
because people can't tell
i mean they actually legitimately can't
tell when you're joking these days
because everything is so ridiculous
that a joke looks like reality
there's no difference anymore
so andre's got
temporarily locked down for making a
joke about it
uh but
uh slovakia has announced a nationwide
coronavirus lockdown
so if five vermectin were making a big
deal in slovakia well is stop doing that
and uh
andres
tweeted out that uh maybe there was a a
variant that has escaped the ivormectin
uh maybe it's an ivermectin escape
variant which is just a joke
but twitter couldn't tell the difference
since they locked them out
so
one of the
key evidences that you heard from
brett and heather on darkhorse
that appears to be debunked
and again let me be very careful in my
wording
i'm not telling you ivermectin doesn't
work
how would i know
i'm just telling you that these
country-wide um evidences they're all
all right uh
uh jay le calm uh helpfully suggested
that i i
i host a live stream debate with pierre
cory
um i think on ivermectin
and it would be a service to your
viewers no matter what happened
to which i will tell you for the
millionth time
gone fall says in in large capital
letters
you do know it works scott let me say
clearly
i don't know that it works
like legitimately i don't know
if i had to put money on it
yeah that'd be a good that's a good
question
if i had to bet money
and it wasn't betting my life but let's
say it's just a financial bat and i
could afford it
would i bet the ivor meccan ivermectin
works
that's a tough one because i think that
you might have a situation where it
works in some special cases
i i wouldn't rule that out
because i don't think we have enough
evidence of that one way or the other
but um i feel like if i had to take the
bet
i'd bet against it
i i would think in in my opinion the
body of
uh unreliable information because it's
all unreliable right to me the body of
information suggests that it doesn't
work
but i would say i have more like a 60 40
on this
so i bet the 60 percent that it doesn't
work
but i'm completely open to a full forty
percent possibility that it works for
some people in some situations it might
i can't rule it out
so
anyway uh let me say that me talking to
one expert will never be a good business
model
it will only make things worse every
time and there can be no exceptions to
this
what would work is have
two experts or more
one on each side of the topic and be
hosting it
that would work pretty well
as long as they had some time and they
could you know
maybe do a little research on the
questions each give each other so you'd
have to figure out how they could do a
you know a proper counter response to
stuff yeah maybe do it over one to three
days you don't do it in one day
that would work but please don't ask me
to interview one rogue doctor there's no
way that can give you good information
because i won't know what to ask here's
how that would go
me
hey do you have any proof that your
opinion works or your opinion is correct
rogue doctor
uh yes there was the
the eastern european indian subcontinent
study that was just completed and then
what do i say
oh
that's the end of the conversation i
can't fact check them in real time
have you seen a credible comparison with
the other proteus protease inhibitors
now being brought to market with
incredible
purported outcomes
a critical comparison
so i don't understand the question chad
but maybe somebody else does are you
talking about in the con
as as a treatment for covet or are you
comparing two different
uh fields i don't know the nature of
that question
all right um
of doctors seeing the successes no
they're seeing the anecdotes they're
seeing the anecdotes
so i saw somebody sent me the anecdote
of the man who was on the ventilator
and the
judge allowed him to have ivermectin and
he came back to life and so therefore
ivermectin must work because there was a
guy in the ventilator and he came back
to life
and here's what's missing in the story
is there anywhere in the united states
where there's somebody who's so
so bad off with kova that they're on a
ventilator
and have not been given regeneron
anywhere
because i'm sure these stories about the
guy who got ivermectin
also got regeneron and we know that
works right
so how could you possibly tell what was
the one that was working
i wouldn't trust any of those stories
so there's a new variant right on time
did you think things were going to open
up or did you think there'd be a new
variant right on time well here it comes
and it's been given a racist name which
is weird it's called the south african
variant
now that's what the racists call it
i would call it the
covid
some greek symbol variant
because i'm not a racist but as steve
cortes points out
the bbc is calling it the south africa
variant and
you know you certainly couldn't call the
covet a chinese virus
or a china virus
which would be less about the people and
more about the country
but
why is this okay
do you notice that the rules just go
away when they're not convenient
that's right
today is not black friday today today is
all people friday all people friday
all right well it looks like we're going
to be served up a uh infinite number of
variants but the big ones will come on
schedule
because what is the schedule
right now this is this is when we should
be afraid of the variance so we're
shutting down our economies again
get your tenth booster shot scott
there's somebody in all caps who's very
concerned for me thank you
uh would you just shout at me in all
caps again i liked it
um
all right looking at your comments for a
moment
uh
all right
oh you love me
well thank you
get that flag up i don't know what that
means
uh here in europe we're calling it the
botswana variant
okay
does hypnosis help chronic pain i'm
being asked
um
i think he can
i think he can
but it also depends on the person and
the hypnotist
and
given the pain is part real and part
you know how you process it i think you
can i'm not 100 sure that by the way
because i've never tried it
but i've heard acupuncture can work in
some cases depending on the pain
by the way
i'm a big acupuncture skeptic
but i've been getting it lately
for just relaxation
and it is crazy how much it relaxes you
like i
um
the first first time i thought okay
that's you know anecdotal i got real
relaxed afterwards that can't be
anything real
but i've repeated it a number of times
and how you feel after you get
acupuncture if you're doing it for
relaxation specifically it's it's kind
of freaky it's kind of freaky you
wouldn't expect it to have anything now
you might say to me
scott scott scott
it's it's all the
placebo effect
but if it works every time
why would i not do it
i mean it doesn't matter what it is if
it works every time i'm going to keep
doing it
college of
uh john devock and pick his brain about
fovid and about therapies
used on the analysis that you're
unwilling to do
all right uh john devorak if you're
watching
that now i don't know if you know but i
i know i've known johns vorak for a
hundred years
and
uh every once in a while we'll you know
we'll chat
and get together or whatever but
um
that would be the same the same thing as
if i talk to one expert
so
i will grant you that john has probably
researched it more than i have
but you know it would have no value
right
that me talking to him because it would
be exactly the same as if i talk to the
expert
so why do you believe x john
and then john says well i researched it
and i found such and such a study
and then what do i say
that's it right
what do i say you found a study
do i say uh some sometimes studies
aren't reliable i think he knows that
do i say
you know if it's only one randomized
controlled study i i'd like to see two
i think john knows that all right
what could i possibly say
to john devorak that he doesn't already
know about this topic
how in the world
could that conversation help you
it couldn't
it couldn't
how does inflation ever stop
well it has stopped everywhere that it's
happened
where the country hasn't gone under
right
there are plenty of countries is israel
one
um give me give me a history lesson
those of you who are smarter than i am
about history which would be most of you
didn't
israel at one point have just horrible
inflation
and now they don't
do me a fact check on that
and i don't i think there are a number
of other places that have had horrible
inflation
and survived so somehow they got past it
yeah and then there would be other
places where they didn't is that correct
so
if there are places that had massive
inflation and then got past it then
there is a way to get past it
but i'm not sure if
i'm not sure anybody understands it now
it could be you have to have massive
productivity gains right
or no maybe not
stop spending stop printing money
well we can't do that with our current
government situation but
um
do you think the current real estate
market will correct of course
yeah easiest question in the world i'm
being asked do i think the real estate
market
will correct
yeah
yeah of course it will i don't know when
and i don't know how much
but i will also confidently predict that
it will recover in time
eventually it will recover
all right wesley says
is it possible to ever stop seeing it
oh when people start seeing the the fake
news can they learn to unsee it yeah i
think so
ask yourself
you know was there a time when you were
more believing in the news and now
you're not i would say that
certainly the case for me
i would say that in my youth i would
generally have thought the news was
right i don't know 99 of the time
today if it's political news i assume
it's wrong
i just assume it's wrong and that's a
pretty big change from almost certainly
right to i just assume that's not true
right
and i think a lot of us went through
that same journey so yes
i believe that people can understand
that they're
that they're
you know
being bamboozled
um
prediction on the brandon thing lasting
past 2022 i don't know that that has
legs but maybe
you know i didn't think maggot was the
greatest
the greatest thing
i like make america my great again
i don't like the abbreviation mega
because it's too obviously like a maggot
you know and of course all the critics
picked up on that in about a half a
second
so you should always run your slogans
past a cartoonist
this is good advice
you come up with a good acronym or a
good slogan
run it past a cartoonist
because you know what we're good at
uh mocking things with words
if i can mock it
better think
when wells fargo um
yours was was actually crocker back
before wells fargo bought him but when i
worked for a back years ago they came up
with a slogan
good enough isn't
and the idea was that you'd never be
satisfied with the quality
good enough isn't
now that was a slogan they should have
run past me before they implemented it
what did the employees do instantly with
their own slogan good enough isn't
pretty much every time they slap
something together they looked at it
they looked at whoever's standing next
to them they laughed and said ah good
enough is
it just immediately became the opposite
i would have told you that
i could have told you that before you
did that slogan i could have told you
that right off the bat uh you know
people are gonna say good enough is and
that's that's gonna be you're gonna hear
that more than your slogan you know that
right
well i could have told them
build back better
build back better is actually about too
bad uh
at least they didn't do you know build
back carefully
i'll let that one just sit there for a
while
at least they didn't do
build back
carefully anybody
anybody
thank you all right some got my joke
um
you hated it initially build back better
oh i don't think that build back better
uh
is like changing the world what i think
is that it's unmockable
it's hard it's hard to mock it
my cat yelling at me
do you mind if i pause to get my cat
do you mind one moment
bring her right back
so as you can see she still has her
feeding tube in
her bandaging is getting a little ragged
i i have to redo the
the wrapping every day
so she's got a few more days
of the feeding tube we don't use it for
food she eats she can eat okay i just
use it for the medicine because she
won't take medicine without spitting it
out so we just left it in for
a little while and in a
few days
she'll get this off
and she'll be all good
she doesn't like this
as much as you think
oh there she is she's relaxed now
all right
that's all for now uh that was your
black friday special cat episode
and
a friday friday of caller
yes people of color friday let's go with
that
all right i got nothing else so i'm
gonna go i'll talk to you later
