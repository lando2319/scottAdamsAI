here to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams clearly
the best thing you're going to do today
and if you'd like this experience to be
well at levels nobody even thought were
possible all you need is a copper Burger
glass attacker Chelsea Stein a canteen
chocolate flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure don't beat it of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
Ah that's good stuff
how's the volume over there on YouTube
do I
saw somebody say it was too high because
my mixer has a high setting on there
right now I noticed I have a cleaning
crew I always worry that the cleaning
crew when they they dust my equipment
they're changing the mixer
settings but I don't think so I think
it's all good
well let's talk about all the things
we'll we'll get to the politics of
course of course
it will get to me of course
but first
um the study this is as uh 50 of people
have quit a job because of a bad manager
now that was on CNBC
50 of the people have quit because of a
bad manager you know what that means
that means that 50 stayed despite having
a bad manager because
there are only bad managers
did you have to wait for me to tell you
I mean I am the creator of the Dilbert
comics I hope you who better but
you do understand that the point the
entire point of a boss
is to make you work harder than the pay
suggests you should
you know that right
so how could you be sort of good under
those circumstances you're either bad at
managing because you're letting
everybody sloth off or you're good at
managing and you're somehow making
people work harder that they think they
order for the pay they're getting I
don't know
I I enjoyed being a manager when I was
one but I have to say it's kind of a
sketchy business getting people to do
things it wouldn't have wanted to do on
their own
all right
um on the west coast there's apparently
a hurricane is forming and should be
coming up Baja and toward California
it's named hurricane Hillary
I'm not making this up
I swear to God I'm not making this up
they actually named the thing hurricane
Hillary
now
if I were the one naming the hill the
hurricane I would have called it
hurricane Monica
I'll wait I'll wait if there's anybody
there you need to explain it to always
hurricane Monica yeah okay
that's all I had on that
there's there was really no other
purpose than
just to say that all right
um Biden continues his uh quiet quitting
you all know the phrase quiet quitting
so it refers to an employee who is not
quitting the job because they can't
afford to quit but they're sort of
retiring in place so they're just not
working
uh the biggest story about Biden
is he said something weird about ice
cream yesterday
that was it
that was the news that the president
made before he goes off to his second
week-long vacation
uh or I guess this is one and the last
one was two or something but he's going
to Lake Tahoe as you know his staff is
telling him that Lake Tahoe is actually
Maui so he'll feel like he's doing some
work it's going to be a beach there's
going to be water he's not going to know
the difference and that's all good
so just put him on the beach there
but as you know the real problem here
does everybody let's see if you all
think this is the problem
don't you believe that Biden has already
been told he's not running
but they can't figure out how to handle
the Kamal Harris situation because the
last thing they want is for her to be in
office for six months or so
because that's going to sort of make her
the obvious choice for the candidate for
president and it gets worse
if she's not the obvious choice for
president you're going to feel a little
uncomfortable if she is one
you know if their own team doesn't want
her to even run for president how
delighted will they be that she's
sitting in the job for six months if
that were to happen
so to me I think the solution to Biden
starts with a solution for kamla I'm
talking about the Democrats own own
strategies
so do you think
that there might be some kind of
Kamala Harris story that's being brewed
up
about why she simply can't run for
office uh
or something
because I don't know something something
came up
something like that
I don't know what's going to happen but
I I think they have like a complete
losing situation
that removing Biden is terrible because
it puts her in the spotlight and keeping
him in there is even worse
see the biggest the biggest wild card is
what is Biden's actual capability right
now
and it seems to me that that's being
hidden from us
I do believe that they can pump him up
for some moments when he's reading a
teleprompter but I I think he's down to
a few minutes a day in front of a
teleprompter and nothing else
am I wrong
it looks like his only capability is
teleprompter
barely
and only for a few minutes and nothing
else
how in the world are they going to
pretend that he's he's just hiding from
covet or something
instead of instead of campaigning
I don't know I I just can't see him
being the final candidate but we'll see
depends on Kamala Maybe
um
so there's new information that says AI
is biased to the left we all knew that
right how could it not be
that isn't the bias of AI entirely based
on what data said it it learns on
do you think the people who made it uh
trained it on a bunch of of a republican
opinion
do you think there's a whole bunch of
Republican opinion that that they said
you know
uh we're we're going to put this
training data and make sure you spend a
lot of time on Breitbart and Fox News
you know you want to get a good healthy
dose of both sides do you think anybody
even thought of doing that or cared or
wanted to that that sounds more like
something you would avoid
if you were a good Democrat working on
AI
so the problem is that
um
well it's one problem I guess
wouldn't you say that
the Democrats are sort of the be nice to
everybody party
generally speaking that's the best way
to frame it and the Republicans are more
of a tough love yeah you're gonna have
to you could have to prove yourself and
make your own way we'll give you the
tools glad to help but you know you're
on your own
so if you were deciding what to teach AI
you would teach at the nice version
wouldn't you because you wouldn't want a
mean AI
so if you teach at the the nice version
where everybody's equal and equity and
we should be good to each other you're
getting an assistant that can't possibly
work for humans
because we need basically we need
incentives and asking to do anything
so you probably have created an AI that
lacks the necessary I'm going to call it
toughness
to be useful
because humans can't deal with too much
kindness or too much niceness that's not
how we're built we need a little
competition a little free market a
little pushback a little tough love a
little little dad is home
then everything works so that's a
problem I think to work through it but
it's a problem right now
all right here's the update on my uh my
book so as you know
for a few days
Amazon's KDP group that's a subgroup
within Amazon so only the subgroup that
handles the publication of independent
publishers so it's basically the
onboarding and filtering before it gets
on the big amazon so it wasn't the big
amazon that ever canceled me it was the
subset you know the sub part just the
publishing arm
and so the story was the last several
days I've been getting emails from them
saying I was banned for life
and the reasons were some unclear
story about me not owning the rights
but when I ask questions I seem to be
getting automated responses but I can't
tell you know they had names of people
on them
but the responses didn't seem responsive
to any of my questions or responses or
or the fact that we had originally sent
documentation showing my ownership
so from the beginning they had
documentation which they ultimately
accept the the band has been reversed
but they always had the documentation it
didn't require any new documentation so
I don't really know what happened
and I don't have any way to now
I do know that if you have a million
followers on x
and you
and you talk about your situation that
that activates an executive response
now the executive response big companies
have this if you didn't know this big
companies have an executive response
team that's monitoring any social media
or PR problems and I'm a social media PR
problem
so I made myself a social media problem
because I knew it would activate the
executive response team
and exactly what I said exactly the way
it's supposed to work the executive
Response Team said oh
we don't need this hanging out on the
internet so they apologized and
immediately reversed it
so the first time that a human was
involved that I can confirm
it was immediately called out as an
error on their side I didn't have to do
anything extra I didn't need to submit
anything or prove anything they had
everything they needed
and they understood that and
you know apologized
so here's the problem
at the same time
uh oh and by the way the so the book is
available in the Kindle form but not yet
a soft cover hardcover those will happen
in a few days as soon as the soft cover
is available I'll I'll push out the
links and promote it so you can buy it
today if you want to go look for it for
a Kindle only
self-cover maybe today or tomorrow I'm
waiting for just waiting for some system
stuff to happen and then the hardcover
maybe in several days I have to approve
the
the the Prototype
and then we should be good to go
right so the Kindle is the usual Kindle
format
anyway
um Glenn Beck coincidentally or not at
the same time I was having my band for
life that's now been reversed
uh Glenn Beck was removed from the Apple
iTunes store without without explanation
now I got an explanation but it didn't
make sense for my situation so it was
kind of like I didn't get one
and he didn't get one either
um the alleged maybe explanation if you
search the internet when they talk about
the story
is that there was a trademark dispute
do you believe there was a trademark
dispute for Glenn Beck's materials
do you believe that well somebody may
have complained I don't know about that
but I think Apple realized it was a
mistake
and as reverse that I understand so I
think he's back in business
and I'm back in business
but both of us have this interesting
technical glitch
now let me ask you
what would happen if that technical
glitch had happened to you
and you didn't have over a million
followers on social media
you would be you would be
absolutely because there's no way
you were going to get anybody alive
you know there's no way you would have
got the human being to help you right if
you didn't have a million followers or
whatever Glenn Beck has it's I'm sure
it's much more
you're out of luck
now ask yourself how important is Elon
Musk
right now
do you think that Glenn Beck or I would
be back in business if Elon Musk was not
running Twitter
because I probably would have been
kicked off at Twitter by now
right it was my only recourse I think I
mean that's my opinion it was my only
recourse and probably his too
right if we didn't have the big profile
we would have been slapped down now it
seems like a little bit of a coincidence
doesn't it that two
two people sort of similarly
situated in in the media situation would
both have a technical problem that had
to do with some IP and it's kind of
complicated and we can't really explain
it but you're banned
kind of a coincidence
you know here's the problem
it probably was a coincidence
it probably was because coincidences do
happen
but in the current media environment
how am I supposed to believe it
how would I believe anything that
anybody says in 2023 no matter who they
are am I going to believe a corporation
am I going to believe a government
who some government entity who exactly
should I believe about anything
so we have this very precarious
situation where an ordinary what could
be
what could be just an ordinary technical
glitch you know that's probably what
happened to both Beck and to me and
here's what I think is happening by the
way there there's there's a I think just
speculating there might be a story
behind both of us that's not about
political intrigue
it might be
then it might not be and here's how it
could be I know that the big entities
that have content
they're having problems with AI
generated content so there was a
situation recently where somebody wrote
a book with AI
put some some known author's name on it
and tried to get money for it
now imagine being Amazon and you've got
to police that
you have a whole new gigantic problem of
AI content that somebody might slap
somebody else's name on
and I think that they ban AI books or at
least audio books at the moment so I
don't know what their policy is on AI
generated content
but imagine trying to police that now
Apple presumably would have the same
problem
so Glenn back might have been scooped up
by here's what I think I think that both
apple and Amazon are likely likely to
have recently implemented some IP
checking AI
in other words there might be an AI
looking for other AI content or looking
for stolen trademarks that would also
come along with the AI you know
so it's possible that there's an
oversensitive AI recently implemented in
more than one place
that is just catching things that didn't
need to be caught
because it might be even worse
to let too much through because it would
just spoil the entire content situation
so that's that's probably what happened
but we have such a low trusted
environment that how could I depend on
that
how could I possibly depend on it was
just an accident
in 2023.
right now back and I are both notable
political voices
and let me ask let me ask you this
because I actually don't know what your
opinion would be you're biased but we'll
see what happens if you were to rank my
political influence
and say it was in the you know top
million
or top something so you you pick the
number
is my political influence in the top
what give me your number top I see top
100.
top five top ten top five percent Top
fifty
top 100 top one percent
so you're you know most of your numbers
are top hundred
some of you are top 15 but I don't know
that's 15 of what
of influencers
top eight top 40. all right now wouldn't
you assume
um
that on both sides if there was both
sides of the political world at least
the top
40 on each side are being targeted
is that fair to say now I don't know
that there's like some coordinated
scheme I'm not saying that I'm saying
that both sides are looking at anything
the the top 40 on the other side does
and they're saying oh I I found a way to
go after you
take my situation
I got first canceled in newspapers
worldwide but really that was the
Washington Times leading that
if a smaller newspaper or several had
canceled me saying I don't like what you
said
it just would have been a few newspapers
I wouldn't even notice it
but when the Washington Post which is
the by the way if you didn't know this
is the most important newspaper that
also carries comics
because you could argue the New York
Times or the Wall Street Journal might
have more clout but they don't carry
Comics so they didn't have anything to
do with my situation
but when the Washington Post says we
must cancel you
then everybody has to cancel me
so the Washington Post is owned by Jeff
Bezos
and the Washington Post is famously
politically biased toward the left
what do you think the Washington Post
thought about me for the last five years
of calling them fake news while they
paid for my comic
do do you imagine that they covered that
in their news coverage when the when the
Washington Post canceled me
I didn't look but do you imagine that
they said and by the way he's been
criticizing The Washington Post by name
for being obvious fake news for years
while we paid him
was that the story do you think
now whether or not they canceled me for
political reasons or not and I would say
the evidence suggests that was probably
the top reason and I say that because no
Republicans ever canceled me ever
there's not a single Republican Outlet
media
person in the country who wouldn't have
me for an interview
or or handle my content if that's the
business they're in or buy it there's
not a single person on the right who
canceled me and it's not because they
agreed with what I said or not
it's just that it was a political
cancellation and they didn't have a
reason to
because they didn't have a reason to
cancel me politically
and the content was something that
nobody nobody would have canceled me
over just for the content of anything I
said and you know why I know it wasn't
the content of what I said
nobody ever followed up to say why did
you say that
I mean a few podcasters I talked to did
but the major news that canceled me they
never even asked
there was no there was no curiosity
whatsoever of why somebody would say the
most provocative thing you could say in
public
now my plan was that people would ask me
why I said it and then it would be this
really useful conversation that came out
of it but instead it turned into just an
excuse to take a political voice off the
field and so happen
all right now given that Jeff Bezos owns
the Washington Post and that situation
clearly has never been explained to the
public you would agree with that at
least at the very least the public was
denied
the understanding of the context at the
very least that's true
and then suddenly Amazon the only thing
you know one of the few things I have
left that didn't cancel me because
Publishers you know the Publishers I'm
sure only a few except
I'll name a few there were some
publishers
who were who were asking me for the you
know to work with them
but they were tend to be the Free Speech
types right the the biggest publishing
houses I would be poisoned because
they'd be all Democrat leading but there
were some other publishing houses that
were not you know Democrat owned who
said they would work with me sure
you know if we could make a deal
so I I want the independent publishing
route uh you know Joshua lysex helping
make that happen and
um so Amazon was really really important
to my future career ambitions
and it's owned by Jeff Bezos and then
suddenly I was banned for life now what
would you think
if a Jeff Bezos property got you your
entire regular career canceled
because that that blew over also to the
publishing publishing could have ignored
me until the Washington Post cancel me I
think my publisher would have said oh
 I wish he hadn't said that and then
we would just ignored it and go on
because I don't think anybody cared
you know I think they may have had some
Dei groups that were part of the process
but yeah I'm sure nobody cared
so
except as a political you know thing
that they use for their own thing
so we have such a low trust environment
along with big corporate ownership of
major entities
that it's a very precarious situation
you just don't know what's true anymore
and who to trust and what is political
and what is technical and what is just
the free market
now would you be surprised to learn that
the very first review from my book is
one star and that uh it it tells you you
should never go near it
it's because I'm a political figure do
you think that the one star review read
the book
because it was posted pretty much the
same time it was available
no of course not yeah I I hope you're
all uh aware that for a political figure
and that's what I am now
uh a one star review doesn't mean
anything it just means that you're on
the other side
You could argue that the five star
reviews
you know are just as biased as people
who like me or something but read them
you know they'll tell you what they like
the one star review is just gonna be
stupid
the five star reviews
are probably gonna add some detail and
look at the detail not the not the star
I would say
uh in my opinion this might be the most
important book that's ever been written
because it literally is
uh the secret to programming your own
mind with words
which we've learned from AI
is doable because that's what a super
prompt is a super prompt
is trading the words that made up the
large language model
and a reframe is how you train your own
brain from a unproductive arrangement of
words in your mind to a productive
arrangement of words in your mind I'll
talk more about that later
all right
let's talk about uh climate change
um
uh Bjorn lomborg is reporting that the
U.N asked 10 million people their top
priorities where you think climate
change was dead last
climate change was dead last and
remember this is the U.N asking the U.N
didn't want this answer
so normally you you wonder well is this
poll motivated by money or something is
it biased but believe me the U.N didn't
want this answer
guess what was the number one priority
number one priority now remember this is
um around the world I assume in the
world
uh well you know here's the messed up
thing do you think that they pulled
anybody who was starving
yeah I'm pretty sure it would have been
food if you pulled starving people but I
feel like they just don't ask the
starving for their opinion
I hate to say it but I just don't think
that happens so it would have been food
I think it would have been food but it
was education
now I
I think I think the wisdom of the crowds
is coming through
isn't this kind of impressive
that despite massive brainwashing
operations just massive brainwashing
to tell us that the top priority was the
environment because that allows them a
whole set of power and funding and
influence Etc
although some some believe it really is
the big problem
and uh I'm not saying it isn't
to me it's more of a I don't know but
um I love the fact that by a large
margin education like just killed
education wasn't barely first
it was first with a bullet like way
first so the public according to this
poll 10 million people around the world
are entirely aware of what the real
situation is
they're completely grounded
they're actually seeing things the way
they are
now I don't know who they I think in
America this wouldn't have worked or
maybe it did wasn't there also a poll in
America that that had climate change
near the bottom I think there was
actually
so this should tell you that the climate
change let's say uh
framing of it being our biggest problem
is probably politically motivated rather
than
socially driven and we know that
scientists are the least credible part
of society they're basically the
marketing department for corporations
so uh and by the way not all scientists
are corrupt just apparently most most or
at least the ones we hear from I I
wouldn't say it's most of scientists but
the ones we hear from
probably slightly more than half are
just corrupt or idiots are lying or
something something like that so I don't
believe scientists or even any studies
because it's 2023 and believing them
would be sort of naive at this point
um
well suppose
suppose instead of thinking that climate
change was our biggest risk
just what if
we treated our biggest risk as our
biggest risk and by the way it's
probably not education
it's probably demographics
now you can argue it's always education
because education gives you the tools to
fix all the other problems and that's
not a bad argument if we were better
educated we'd be able to fix all the
other problems a little bit better maybe
maybe unless we all became woke because
the colleges are broken and then we just
fight each other
but suppose you agree with Peter Zan
that are you know that Russia and China
have a gigantic demographic problem that
there doesn't seem to be a solution for
it looks like it's unsolvable in terms
of it's going to drag down their
countries the United States also has a
problem but we have one advantage that
most countries don't have
we're not using it
but we haven't
that Advantage is we could
choose the best people from every
country
and let them in almost without control
you know as long as they brought talent
and resources and you know that they
were bringing the things we wanted
we could actually be the only country
that thrives while demographics are
destroying our competitors around the
world
but we'd have to do it by Massive
pro-immigration of the right people
meaning qualified and adding value while
severely restricting immigration of
criminals and you know drugs and stuff
like that so you'd have to do both you'd
have to vastly vastly increase
immigration
vastly just probably to survive
because I don't think we can reproduce
fast enough to be a country in a hundred
years in a hundred years everybody's
going to be in trouble unless the robots
are doing everything for us
so imagine if our organizing principle
for our laws and our priorities you know
our money suppose it was all around the
demographic bomb
because that's the big one
now that doesn't mean we should stop you
know mitigating against disasters
developing green energy within the free
market we should do all those things
improving education absolutely
but as an organizing principle climate
change might be the worst
what do you think because we do sort of
say climate change no matter what you're
doing let's make a law about littering
but make sure it's compatible with
climate change right so right now
everything we do
is within the frame of climate change
being the umbrella risk we can't do
anything under the umbrella if it's
competitive with the umbrella
right but suppose our umbrella instead
was demographic uh death spiral and then
everything we did within that had to
support the fact that the our
competitors are going to die from
demographic you know starvation
now our advantages that we are we have a
flexible system and we can in theory
elect leaders who would give us the
priorities and the solutions we need in
China that's just not the case
I don't see China Japan Russia just
opening up immigration and saying well
all right if you want to be a citizen
come on in
and I don't think that they could filter
to get the best people the way we could
hey best person you're really good at
programming how would you like a job in
Russia what
no no no I didn't mean Russia how would
you like a job in China what ah just
kidding how would you like a job in the
United States
where Chicago no I'm just kidding no
nobody goes to Chicago but there might
be some place you could live in safety
in the United States for a while
so I'm just going to put that out there
that we don't have any candidate on the
left or the right who is calling out
what a lot of smart people and this
would include Elon Musk Peter Zan and a
lot of smart people would say is our
biggest problem
the biggest problem demographic bomb
nobody's saying that
they are saying oh climate change isn't
as big a problem as you think
but it's a bigger problem than it's the
biggest problem
if it becomes the organizing principle
that determines how much money and
energy you have for all your other
problems
that's a real drag on everything
so you got to figure out what your
biggest problem is and get that right
all right well we might fix that with
robots and Military Automation and
attracting immigrants
um here's the story NB News NBC news
says
the conservative election activists have
created this new database called Eagle
AI
is backed by a trump Alliant lawyer
Kalita Mitchell
to search for ineligible voters but they
worry that that system will be
unreliable so it can be a problem if the
Republicans have a system that says hey
these voters are ineligible because they
lived in another state or they're under
18 or they're dead or whatever but if
that's a but if the database itself
is unreliable
then you would have an unreliable
database trying to monitor an unreliable
election system and this was reported To
Us by the most unreliable News NBC yeah
so an unreliable news entity NBC reports
that there might be an unreliable
monitoring system for the unreliable
elections
has there ever been a more 2023 story
then an unreliable news entity talking
about an unreliable solution to an
unreliable database
it's just kind of perfect
how about some good news
uh you know how microplastics are
killing us all because the oceans and
water are water supplies apparently most
of our drinking water as micro plastic
in it but now researchers
at UBC found that they've they've got
some kind of solution where they can add
tannins some natural plant compound that
makes your mouth Pucker I don't know why
you'd put that in your mouth but you
know I guess it's part of food or
something and they could put this on
wood
or wood shavings and the plastic just
sucks to it and stays there so they've
actually found a thing that can suck
microplastics out of water
that's kind of a big deal I think
because I don't want to drink too many
more micro Plastics now they claim
yeah they claim
that there's nothing about what they've
discovered that can't be scaled up
because all the all the materials are
easily attainable and really all you're
doing is adding something to sawdust
it's basically pile of sawdust
add some stuff to it and you've got a
filter for microplastics
so pretty awesome if it works maybe you
have to cut down every tree to get
enough wood to get rid of the
microplastics but hey that's another
problem that's for later
all right I've said this before but it's
the best idea I've ever had so I'm going
to say it again we need some kind of a
show
TV or Internet or YouTube
in which people who have been denied
access to the news get to see it for the
first time so it'd be like a reaction
show to see what happens to people when
they learn the real news for the first
time and don't get cocky
because you could do this with people on
the left or the right right I remember a
long conversation I had with a now
deceased relative who when Obama was in
office he told me matter of factly that
it was the fact that he was a Muslim
and I said what
what you think the president of the
United States is a practicing Muslim or
a secret Muslim no practicing Muslim
everybody knows he's a he's a practicing
Muslim
and I said
what
he's he's a Christian
now I hear what you're saying yes um you
know Islamic influence but are you
actually saying that he like goes to the
it goes the praise street whatever times
a day he's like yeah he's a practicing
Muslim
now this was an adult
who followed the news closely
and he believed that the news had told
them
very clearly that Obama was a practicing
Muslim
now we don't need to get into whether he
was a sacred Muslim because that wasn't
the claim the claim was overtly publicly
he was a Muslim now
I washed his face when I said
um no and I think I Googled something
and showed it to him you should have
seen his face
because he'd never seen that before
he had never heard
that Obama was a Christian
never heard it
well it wasn't denying it never even
heard it
isn't that amazing
now imagine what it is on the other side
do you know how many people think that
that Trump did collude with Russia
and he's got like Investments with him
and I hear all kinds of wild stuff that
I think have you never seen the news
have you really have you serious you
you've never seen the news
how in the world could you believe these
things but of course it's because of our
bubbles but it would be a fascinating
show to see let's say somebody on the
left have their Bubble Burst and then do
it with somebody on the right just so
you can show that it's it's everybody
it's not just one side
all right so here's what it would look
like
um
um the host of the show might say to the
let's say a Democrat did Trump try to
steal the election in 2020 using a fake
slate of electors and let's say the
person would say something like well
obviously and he should be jailed for
that
yeah obviously you tried to overthrow
the country with his fake electors and
then what this show would do for example
is play the uh compilation clip
of the 2016 election with you know Ari
melber and MSNBC and Hillary Clinton
basically saying that this uh alternate
slate of electors is normal business
this is normal it's in the Constitution
the presidency is the one place that
this makes sense yeah you could totally
do that and just see what would happen
to someone who had been told that this
is you know clearly stealing an election
to find out that the very people who are
saying is stealing
are the people who just a few years ago
said oh it's perfectly acceptable this
is normal procedure what would happen to
the the person who saw that for the
first time
or any of the Trump compilation clips
that show that the thing they've been
taught was a rupar video you all know
what a rupar video is is a video in
which you if you remove a part of it it
reverses its meaning it doesn't just
change its meaning it actually turns it
to its opposite
that's a rhubarb video so you show the
uh you ask some Democrats so do you
think Trump did this or that the the
famous one is do you think he mocked a
guy with a disability of his arm
every Democrat thinks that's true they
all think he did and then you show the
compilation clip from years going before
that where he was doing the same
gestations about Ted Cruz and there were
some generally talked about and you can
see that it's just a thing he does
then what would what would somebody do
if they saw that
well cognitive dissonance so you would
also have your show you'd have a
psychologist there an expert in
cognitive distance or a hypnotist and
that would be part of the part of the
entertainment is that is that the expert
would say you're experiencing cognitive
dissonance
uh you you best your your beliefs have
been clearly disproven and debunked and
you can see it for yourself and you know
that it's been debunked but you're
having an experience
in which you're hallucinating and then
you just say what you're hallucinating
because everybody hallucinates in that
situation hosted by John Stossel
yeah
yeah
John Stossel would actually be perfect
for that that's a perfect suggestion
because he's not John Stossel is not in
my opinion
either left or right
I actually don't know what he what he is
he seems to go after things that just
objectively it's a problem he doesn't
seem to go after things that you know
might be a problem if you're a Democrat
or might be a problem if you're a
republican yeah he's a Libertarian I
believe so he goes after like an actual
physical problem in the world
so it doesn't seem to be biased at all
he'd be perfect actually
um
all right
let's see what else is happening
um and likewise I'd like to see how to
interpret the news
you know some of the stuff that I do
where I say all right
the news story has
um
uh one anonymous source
and then you say Do you believe it and
then the person would say often yes I do
believe it that sounds true to me and
then you sort of lead them through how
one anonymous source never means true is
closer to a guarantee it's not true an
anonymous horse
so you basically have people training
people how to understand the news with
the understanding that it's all fake
all right we have an interesting
situation coming up
where let's say it's Biden versus Trump
I don't think it will be
I just realized I forgot to put my
garbage out and the garbage trucks are
going by right now and I'm going to be
really in trouble tomorrow
ah because I have no place to put my
garbage now damn it uh anyway but back
to you so we're gonna have either a
president of the United States or a
prisoner of the United States
so it seems to me
um
that if Biden got reelected they'd make
sure Trump went to jail
and it seems to me if Trump got elected
he would go after the Biden crime family
and there's a good chance they would go
to jail so we have a situation in which
the loser is a very good chance of going
to jail
can we put up with that
now I know you want to say but but but
it's all Biden's fault because he's the
one
falsely accusing Trump you might say
uh and he's the one doing the Biden
crime family stuff so it's really a
problem on one side it's just you know
affecting the other side
of course you can say that but you know
the others would say Trump's the real
problem not Biden so you never you'd
never solve that but we do have a
situation where
by Design
we we can predict now that no matter
what happens no matter who wins if it's
Biden versus Trump we can predict riots
would you agree
because one side is going to jail the
other side or they're going to try
really hard that should give you riots
now we should have fixed and I'm not I'm
not recommending riots I'm very much
against that so no violence I'm just
saying that if you design a system that
guarantees the leader of the losing side
goes to jail
what else could happen
what else there's no second thing that
happens am I right
what's the second possibility
if the loser is definitely going to jail
there's no second possibility
there's going to be riots we just don't
know which side is going to Riot
because the media has set us up to
believe that whichever whichever outcome
happens it's illegitimate
the media has basically trained us that
if our side doesn't win whichever side
you're on if our side doesn't win
it's rigged
what are you gonna do
now it's also maybe a trek to make
Republicans overreact
you know that right
they might be just trying to get
Republicans to overact because one more
Republican overtreaction you know
imagine a Biden win but is close and
it's disputed and there's yet another
big event with Republicans acting poorly
in some cases
that could be just the end of
Republicans
you know you could imagine the the
Democrats just jailing everybody who who
tweeted anything supportive there would
be just nothing left to the Republicans
so so it could be a Kill Shot for the
entire Republican party you know they
may be setting it up for the the
ultimate kill shot but I tend to imagine
that there's no leader of any of this
stuff
what I see is a whole bunch of people
acting uh along what they think is their
best interest and collectively it gives
the look of somebody being in charge
who's the devil
just listen to what you just said Scott
that doesn't help me
there's a comment on YouTube just listen
to what you just said
I'm going to need more than that
a little bit more of a hint
all right
um 41 of likely U.S voters this is
Rasmussen believe it's more likely Trump
will be elected
uh but 38 percent think it's more likely
he'll be sentenced to federal prison
so almost the same number of people
think you'll be elected president as
sentenced to prison
not just not just tried or indicted
but sentenced
who do you think the 38 percent are
mostly mostly Democrats of course so the
Democrat news is saying Trump of course
is guilty he should be in jail
what happens if he doesn't go to jail
the Democrats will say well
things are so evil that the the gloves
are off and we can do anything legal or
illegal because look what the other side
is doing yeah everything about our
current situation is aiming at riots
now if I were a conspiracy theorist
I would say well that's what the elites
want you know they want us to burn down
everything so they can buy it back cheap
and and control everything and they'll
use it as an excuse to clamp down and
surveil us and control us forever and
cut off our money and give us digital
currency and all that now I think all
that could happen
all of that could happen
but I just don't feel there's like a
boss do you
and if it is who is it is it Klaus
Schwab is it Hillary Clinton is that the
sorrows
is it you I see somebody saying Islam
is it Putin is it Obama
see the problem the problem with Susan
Rice is that the problem with the
Victoria Newland right CIA the problem
with the somebody at the top is is
organizing it all
the problem with that is who is it
if we don't agree on who's organizing it
it's probably not being organized but I
do think lots of people might say well
I don't mind a little sloppiness here
and I'm going to hurt the other side
anyway I can I I feel like everything
we're seeing is just the result of
people following what they think is in
their best interest
I do not think is coordinated at the top
with the exception of the legal the
legal moves against Trump appear clearly
coordinated did anybody catch the Fox
News timeline where they showed all the
four uh the four Trump indictments and
they followed within 24 hours of every
really really bad news cycle for Biden
now it could be that they were all going
to happen anyway but that the Democrats
you know on top of that were timing it
so the timing might be not a crime or
evidence of a crime it could be simply a
political move on top of a you know a
normal criminal activity
or criminal investigation or indictments
right now that's one View the other view
is that the charges themselves are
complete which I would say they
look like it
right now I'm no legal expert but if
dershowitz says there's nothing there
that the Supreme Court won't over
overturn
I would say that the Judgment that the
charges are and completely
political
are very strong
very strong I do not believe there's
anybody who's worried about the criminal
activities of trump in the past or the
future I don't think anybody cares about
it
no matter what they believe he did I
just don't think they care I think it's
just a political expedient thing to take
a competitor off the field
well nurse is getting old but he's he's
the smartest old I've ever seen
have you ever seen anybody's brain
who worked better at that age than
dershowitz is he 80
what what is his age now
give me his actual age
he's not 87. I don't think he's he's not
85 is he
is he 85
wow well
I just listened to him the other day and
he talks like a 20 year old
if you can find me a 20 year old who can
speak as clearly and sharply
as dershowitz at mid 80s whatever it is
you show me I've never seen it
he's still at the top of his game it's
incredible actually and I would think
that he's a good example of if you
continue working and keeping your mind
sharp you can actually do really well
with managing your mental cognitive
abilities so he looks like somebody
who's just used his brain so well and so
often
that he has maintained
what looks like full capacity
to me which is amazing
full capacity mental capacity
all right
all right well troubles troubles Brewing
if I were going to uh guess what would
be the perfect third act for Trump
because as you know reality for some
strange reason uh follows the path of
the most entertaining movie
so Thompson clearly is his third act the
third Act is where it's impossible to
get out four indictments total law fair
attack
um
and a system that he probably thinks is
rigged he does think he's rigged what
would be the best third act well I've
already told you the best third act
would be and I'm not and by the way oh
oh I'm not going to say it and I'll see
if I get banned
so I did I mention that YouTube started
automatically demonetizing me again
do you remember the last time they did
that
when was the last time they
automatically demonetized me no matter
what I said
it was in the run-up to the last
election
after the election
when when my voice wasn't as important I
did not get demonetized for a long time
at all
is my content more dangerous or
inaccurate than any other thing that
I've done ever no there's no difference
same kind of content when I talk about
um
see the problem is
there's a topic that if I mention it I'm
going to get demonetized you know what
it is right
do you know the topic
it's not the pandemic
not the pandemic
yeah
you you know what it is so let's do a
test
I won't mention the topic
but you already know what I think about
it
but I won't say the name let's see if
the let's see if I get demonetized for
it but one possible third act would be
that Trump uh maybe
had some information that would suggest
that a thing I would never talk about on
YouTube was not exactly the way people
thought it was
so you're gonna have to do a little work
to figure out what I just said because
if I say it out loud I could be kicked
off the platform for just talking about
a topic
when I say kicked off I've been
demonetized if I got demonetized I would
stop using the product of course if I
were totally demonetized so
that's one possibility but I'm I'm
seeing people start to wonder if the
legal treatment about Trump is making
the Black American community
feel some
connection to him as in agreeing that
the system is broken
and I don't I'm not quite ready to say
that Black America is going to back him
there was I saw some survey that
suggested his support had gone up I saw
a podcast video of a black American
saying that it was his opinion that
black Americans would recognize this as
a somewhat obvious use of the law to
punish somebody
and you know who feels that the law is
being used to punish somebody
so the black community might on a purely
sort of emotional connection level feel
that they have a common enemy the legal
system and specifically this one
podcaster was talking about the fact
that the Democrats are the people behind
the legal system that's bothering Trump
as well as the legal system that's been
the bane of many of their existence for
a long time
so I'm not ready to say that this trend
is real
but I will say that Trump has a Avenue
to make it real
he just has to say we have a common
enemy
and he just has to say Democrats have
always been the common enemy
it's just obvious now
join me
now I think he'd have to promise
something
that would get to whatever Black America
wants especially with the legal system
if there's anything he could promise
that hasn't already been done such as
you know we'll we'll fund I don't know
if this is necessary but we'll fund body
cams so that no no traffic stop has no
body camps but there are several other
things that are sort of in that domain
that he could just say all right I'll
get you a federal funding to
reduce this problem or that problem
but
I I think he could make a he could make
a thing out of this I think he could
actually
um turn it his way
all right be nice no bad comments over
here
um
Mary Trump uh Trump's niece had some bad
things to say about Trump's state of
mind and personality and character
does Trump have the worst niece of all
time
you know my nieces they never say things
about that like about me like that
I mean I haven't checked lately
but I'm almost positive
I've never had a niece
who called me names and on TV
he has the worst niece I've ever heard
if there was some competition for the
most terrible niece anybody ever had
that would be her
all right that's all I had to say about
her uh apparently this is terrible the
names of the grand jury members who did
the latest Trump indictment have somehow
been circulating I don't know how they
got oh I guess they're not
they're not leaked right it's actually
published in Georgia after the decision
somebody said that their names are
public
that seemed wrong
they were published by
by the government by the
by the state
by the clerk
so I guess I don't understand the story
because I know that there was the thing
about the fake indictment outcome was
published but that was that the same
thing that had the names of the jury
it was the same
all right there's something about the
story that doesn't make sense to me but
I guess uh but let me here's the bottom
line if in fact those names are floating
around
um this would be like hugely damaging to
The credibility of the system because
you don't want jurors who have to worry
about their lives
for for their votes would you agree we
don't want a system
where a grand jury jury has to worry
about their lives because of what they
voted would you agree
I don't know
I'm not sure I agree
um here's why
because there is a limit
there is a limit
now that limit is Extreme
but it could be that these people have
uh fraudulently and knowingly
knowingly and fraudulently
created a situation where there will be
riots in the country
or they've contributed to it
do you think that they were do you think
that they were trying to find the truth
do you think that the information was
presented to them in a way that they
could even know that they had enough to
make a good decision now remember
they're only saying I think there's
something here they're not saying if
he's guilty or innocent they're just
saying yes there seems to be evidence
that should be followed up on with the
trial
yeah it's I think this is an edge case
for me
I'm still leaning toward there's no
situation where you want a juror to be
threatened because you know ultimately
the mafia would start threatening them
but
under the extreme situation where it
looks like you're in the middle of a
coup
do the rules apply
because to me this looks like a coup
to me it looks like using Loft air to
take a political play around and that
the charges are known by the people
pressing them as not that
they're not technically true there might
be some technically there might be some
technical crimes there but there's
nobody who thinks that the reason it's
being pressed is for the benefit of the
rule of law
nobody believes that we all believe it's
political
we all do you can say nobody's above the
law
but somebody sent a meme around of
Nelson Mandela was Nelson Mandela above
the law
has nobody ever been jailed uh unfairly
have you ever heard of a a black
American whoever who was ever unfairly
jailed because of eyewitness reports
it's pretty common
pretty common
so jailing people falsely unfortunately
is not rare enough that you can rule it
out it's not that rare
it's just not that rare so yeah nobody's
above the law
but the law
is not straight
right it's sort of like saying don't
shoot at the monster because nobody's
bit nobody is above the monster
right well it might kill you
so maybe
think about it
all right well I'm going to go with uh
it's bad that anybody has the names of
the Grandeur I think if anybody messed
with the grand jury
they should just be shot
I mean not not literally but if if
you're messing with a citizen who is
just trying to do their job
I'm not going to be too happy with you
but it is true that we don't know if
they did their job
they may have been presented such a
biased set of facts that there was
really no question which way it was
going to go in that case they're just
citizens doing their job and they should
be held blameless
but you can't tell in 2023 you don't
know if they really even tried to do
their job or did they just vote their
opinion
all right um
there's a plea deal that's going on for
the 9-1-1 architect that Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed
so that he might actually
not be executed
um
does that does it look like he could be
freed
is the other possibility if he's not
executed is the possibility he could be
freed
there's no possibility he goes free
right
because I was thinking that uh the the
ultimate penalty
would be to set him free
but he can only live within New York
City
it's sort of a double penalty number one
you you know have to put up with all the
crime and degradation of the city
but number two
yeah good luck
good luck
all right
so do you think that the Maui fires were
evidence of climate change or evidence
that climate change alarm is
which wasn't now forget about the cause
forget about the cause because even if
it was arson or even if it was a you
know a blast from space it wasn't but
even if it was
um the amount of damage from the fire is
its own separate situation so
independent of cause forget about the
cause
the dryness is what caused it to be bad
so it doesn't matter if it was one match
or one power line that's not the
conversation
what matters is the situation was such
that once it started it was a disaster
I would say this is the strongest
evidence yet
that climate change can be mitigated or
at least any damage from it can be
mitigated because this is the cleanest
example I've seen where people had
plenty of warning and they knew exactly
what to do to avoid this and then they
didn't do it so the reports are coming
in that they've known since 2019 that
their power lines were sparking
something about gas nearby they'd seen
the sparking they had they they had
tried to correct it but didn't do much
about it you know they wasn't really
funded apparently enough
there was also a thing about the water
being maybe limited I think that story
is fake news
in in one sense not fake in the sense
that they didn't have water it seems
true that they didn't have water and
hydrants
the fake news I think is that the person
in charge of releasing the water I guess
was it Obama
type of guy and he was uh you know
he thought that protecting the water as
a resource was sort of a
almost cultural holy requirement
and so the right or blaming him for
trying to withhold his Sacred Water
at the at the expense of burning up a
city
now I don't think that's what happened
we do know that there wasn't enough
water that seems true but I'd really
have to hear from that guy before I
think he didn't allow you the water
because he wanted to protect the Sacred
Water
all right uh I saw the reports
I saw the reports I saw the videos
I'm just saying I need to hear from him
because if he says I tried but there was
a technical problem well let's look into
that
but if he says yeah you know
uh the the fire was bad but we have to
protect our sacred resources
maybe I mean if he said it directly I'll
agree with you but I don't think so
doesn't it sound a little uh let me ask
you this let's put it to the test
let's run it through the fake news
filter
a little little too on the nose
a little too on the nose that the Obama
appointee denied water because he was a
climate change lover and not and not a
practical person is that too on the nose
come on you know it is you know it's too
on the nose you don't want it to be
because you want to you want to be
guilty right no that's two on the nose
it's way too on the nose
now could it be true
I suppose
right the fact that there's two on the
nose doesn't mean it's impossible
I would give it a five percent chance of
being true
five percent
because it's too on the nose
how many times have you seen the two on
the nose filter work
have you seen it work 10 out of ten I
mean every time I've used it it sort I
think has ever not worked
in any situation where I brought it up
has never not worked I don't think so I
think it's worked every time
so if you're betting against two on the
nose just know that you're taking the
long shot bet
but we do know that they could have
cleared the brush and I would say this
is just a perfect explanation of why
climate change alarm is and RFK
Jr and others are on they're on target
when they say just do all the things
you're supposed to do to protect the
land and the water in the air
and everything's going to work out you
know the free market will work out the
the CO2 part
Mary says Scott let me read this comment
Mary says Scott consider the possibility
that it is as clear as the nose under
your face
all right let me do that
uh consider that it is as clear as this
so it's a hundred to one likelihood that
it's two on the news but consider
consider all right I'm considering it
Mary
done I have considered it request
accepted
all right uh
Andrew vac is talking about yeah the
same thing that uh the you know you're
saying that the the Dei agenda may have
caused this person to be in their job
maybe he had something to do with poor
response to the fire
but
certainly going back to my original
point
if climate change is your organizing
umbrella principle and everything below
it has to be subsidiary to it
is that what burned up Lahaina
I don't know
probably not because I because I don't
think it was that water problem I think
it was the not doing the brush so I
don't think that uh uh climate change
per se was the problem unless unless
the money that would have gone to
mitigating the fire risk
if that money went instead to some
claimity kind of green thing that didn't
work out well then you could make the
argument that your umbrella concern made
money go from the thing you desperately
needed to the thing you didn't need at
all that may be the case
but the larger the larger point is that
as long as you have an umbrella policy
that everything has to be compatible
with climate change you're going to get
a certain set of outcomes and I think
you get a very different one if your
umbrella problem was your demographic
Time Bomb that's
probably the the deeper risk
that
is what you should keep in mind all
right did I miss anything is there any
story that you wish I had talked about
that I forgot oh I guess Biden is
allocated seven hundred dollars per
resident
um I guess that's what he's doing
you know I don't have a problem with
that
I don't have a problem with that
you know everybody says there should be
more
you should be sooner it should be more
let's just say that about everything
oh you should have done it sooner you
should have done more
do I think uh do I think the residents
need more yes
yes if he gave them ten thousand dollars
would I think it was enough
no
no because a lot of people lost a lot
more than ten thousand and they're going
to need a lot more than that to get back
to where they were if if you think
that's a goal
so
I hear what you're saying and I don't
disagree the 700 sounds low sounded low
to me you know especially in the in the
inflationary world
it seems low
and per household oh per household even
lower right my my take on that was it
was seven hundred dollars just to get
you to the point where the food supply
and maybe FEMA could take over yeah but
maybe it was just like a little
temporary thing but really you need the
bigger Solutions you know the bigger
Solutions are the real thing but
temporarily 700 bucks would be kind of
useful on the ground
so I'm not going to say it's enough I'm
not going to say you did a good job I'm
going to say
just know it's never soon enough and
it's never enough
so it's true but I don't know it's not
where I'm going to make a big Point all
right so comparing to Ukraine is
bad thinking
yeah you can look at here's how you do
it
you should not look at your other
projects
as your comparison that would be a
mistake
you should look at them each
individually and say is this worth the
money
if they're each individually worth the
money then you fund them both
but if one gets funded and then the
other doesn't it's not it shouldn't be
because of the other one it's because
there was only one good idea where
people thought so
so this is something I learned you know
in my Journeys through economics and
business school and doing budgets and
stuff you you don't if you're going to
do a should we spend money on this
project you don't compare it always to a
specific
unrelated use
instead you compare it to a discount
rate
now without getting too technical
comparing it to a discount rate means
you're comparing your current project to
the average of things you could do with
the money not to a specific thing
that has nothing to do with your project
but to the average of other things you
could do with money in general
if the thing you want to do your project
is better than the average you can do in
general you do it if it's not as good as
the average you don't do it now the the
difference now a special case would be
if you're trying to decide between two
things in the same domain
if they're in the same domain then you
do compare them
because you can either replace your
computers or you can live with them for
another year with upgrades right those
are same domain so that comparison you
do head to head but you don't do a
comparison of should we spend money to
upgrade our computers or should we
um
beef up our Dei group
those are different domains so each of
them would be compared against the
discount rate the average of good ideas
now the Dei one you probably wouldn't
through put through an economic filter
but you should at least mentally you
should
does everybody get that it's a political
appoint
to say you know Ukraine versus Maui they
are not a proper comparison each must be
each must be looked at on their own
Merit compared to the average that you
can do with money not to each other
but it's a good political point
all right well there's something that
some of you learned for the first time
how many of you knew that
how many how many knew what I just
explained already because I'm kind of
curious
so a number of you knew it
I saw one now
some said you're wrong
no I'm not wrong
I'm definitely not wrong this this is my
area of expertise by the way
I did it for a living I'm not guessing
I'm telling you the proper way to
analyze it
all right
um it was new to some of you so this is
interesting because the people on locals
mostly said they they already knew the
people on YouTube who see less of me
um
it was a little bit more new to you
uh you've got to choose where to spend
your limited funds that is incorrect
drywolf that's where you're wrong
you do not have to choose where to spend
your limited funds that that's exactly
the error in your thinking
funds are never Limited
that's the problem in politics we act
like they are but they're not
they're not
because we can borrow until we go into
business
right and you can borrow unlimited money
if the thing you're using it for no you
can borrow unlimited money if the thing
you're losing you're using it for pays
you back more than you borrowed
for example
if you're a business
and you have two things let's say two
pieces of equipment you want to replace
but you have limited money and your
budget is limited what are you going to
do if there's two things you need to
replace and let's say the replacement of
each will save you a lot of money during
the year
can you do both you've got limited money
only enough money to do one but both of
them will make you money
you can do both
you do not have a limit that's imaginary
because you can borrow
you can borrow whenever you have a good
idea that's going to pay itself back and
the bank can tell that's a good idea if
you get rid of that inefficient machine
put in the new one that everybody else
uses we know it reduces your expenses by
50 percent oh you could totally pay back
the loan you could have all kinds of
cash because you're reduced now good
ideas always get done
they do not compete with other ideas
except in our minds
good ideas pay for themselves
bad ideas or just bad ideas now in the
real world
you're saying to me yeah that's nice
theoretically but in the real world your
boss doesn't want to ask for extra money
and I would push back on your pushback
no in the real world I've been the
budget person who didn't have enough
money and I didn't have a single good
idea that wasn't funded within the
corporate environment
I had bad ideas that weren't funded a
lot of them bad ideas
but no good idea was unfunded ever it
just didn't happen and we had limited
resources but everything good got funded
when you couldn't fund it within your
group
you took it to your boss's boss you know
with permission and then the boss's boss
would say oh yeah you don't have enough
money for that so I'll give you some
extra money
right and if it went up the line to the
boss of bosses and they thought that the
thing was important enough
they'd raise money in the capital
markets or borrow money or something but
a good idea gets funded
that's just a good general rule bad
ideas do not
we hope sometimes they do
all right anything else
I believe I've gone on long enough
YouTube
are you entertained
I'll tell you about my book a little bit
more tomorrow
I think
bye for now
thanks for coming
