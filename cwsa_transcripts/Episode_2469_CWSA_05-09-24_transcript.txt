all right looks like we've got Rumble
online we've
got anybody from YouTube here yet um I'm
looking at the comments to figure out
which which platforms are live YouTube
online Rumble online I think X is here
too but where we'll start with
that by the way I'm using the rumble
Studio
program which is really terrific for
going to multiple platforms and uh
having one piece of software with no
Hardware extra Hardware just open your
browser go to the rumble Studio it's
amazing well welcome to coffee with
Scott Adams a highlight of human
civilization if you'd like to take your
experience up a notch and I know you do
because that's the kind of people you
are all you have to do for that is grab
yourself a cuper marar glass a tanker
Jal d a canteen Jugger flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like cfee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine
here the day thing makes everything
better it's called a simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
ah oh I can feel the goodness all the
way down in my body now some of you uh
were here when I had author Carmen Simon
on about her book which you've already
seen made you look which is full of all
kinds of
psychological information about what
would hold somebody's
attention and um I heard this morning
that it's number one in in uh the
marketing and business category on
Amazon so Oprah you think you got power
Oprah no you don't have
power I can move some books on this
program anyway so congratulations to
Carmen Simon her book made you look
number one on Amazon in the business and
marketing category this morning well
speaking of uh fun
things uh if you are subscribing
to the Dilbert comic on X see my profile
or on locals Scott adams. locals so you
would know that you also see in addition
to the Daily comic the digital version
of the calendar which has a comic from
10 years ago and 10 years ago so this
was before I was doing any political
stuff I I want you to see if you can see
the the seeds of my thinking in this
comic so it's something that you've
heard me say a number of times I'll say
it again today actually later but you
can see you can see the germs of it in
the comic 10 years ago so as a comic in
which the CEO and Wally are at a
table there are other people but the CEO
says studies show that people who
exercise are
healthier and Wally says that's because
people uh who are in poor health don't
exercise and the CEO says why does it
seem as if you ruin every meeting and
Wally says is it because I only attend
the ones that are
stupid now you can probably see my
philosophy coming through which is that
science is usually
backwards the the people who don't feel
good are the ones who don't go for a
run it's a little hard to Su out cause
and effect I mean I do believe obviously
the exercise is good for you you know
there's no doubt about that but when you
see a specific study the say that uh the
healthiest people are the ones who
exercise I'm thinking yeah the uh the
people who are able to exercise are more
likely to do it that's
true
anyway uh here's some breaking news
um Google and CNN have reached uh some
kind of agreement they're going to
launch a new video sharing product so
it' be like YouTube except in this case
uh more adult content so Google and CNN
are getting together on that the name of
the new Venture is uh youtubein
youtubein no it's not I made that up but
really most of the news is made up so
the best you can do sometimes is that
the madeup news is funny so this is
basically the best news you can get it's
not true just like all the other news
but at least it's
funny I I call myself the king of the
naughty dad
jokes anybody can do a dad joke but if
you can do a naughty dad joke well
that's a little higher
level all right there's a story says
Ultra processed foods are linked to
Shorter lifespans so people who are
eating more ultr processed foods are not
living as long now I believe that that
is very likely a true
correlation causation NE in other words
I'm sure the eating process foods is not
the best thing you can do for your
health however do you trust a
study that pretends it can isolate that
variable don't you think there are a
whole bunch of things that people who
eat more processed foods also have in
common I mean I'll just throw in a
few don't you have to have a lot of
spare time to not eat processed foods
the main PE I think the main reason
people do it is convenience right
there's just not enough hours in the day
like the the reason that I can eat a
good
diet if I may be completely obnoxious in
the interest of
information is because I'm
rich I don't know how you would have a
good diet if you weren't rich not
because it costs more but because I
literally have
help if I had to feed myself
you know instead of using door Dash or
something that can give me like a
prepared food that I can choose so it's
doesn't have a lot of additives or or I
have an assistant who can do some
shopping for me and some prep like if I
didn't have that I'm sure I don't
wouldn't do it so how do you isolate the
convenience factor because if you took
the people who don't have enough time to
eat well you'd have a lot of people with
stressful
lives and the stress isn't good for you
so how how do you sort that out of the
study so I'm going to say I believe the
results but not the
study because I'm pretty sure that our
food supply is you know uh suboptimal I
think it's actually poison
um but I don't know you can tease it out
in the study I just don't know that
that's possible I'm
skeptical here's another study uh that
says Psychopathic women tend to move
their heads very little when talking to
other people
so if you see a woman who's talking to
you and her head is not moving as much
as you expect her head to move she might
be a
psychopath now you're probably
wondering oh I know what it looks like
when your head doesn't move like that's
easy to imagine but what exactly does it
look like if you're not a psychopath and
you're a woman and your head is moving
in a way that is perfectly naturally and
natural and healthy
oh I so want to do this impression on
camera but it's going to become a meme
do you know how funny it would
be if I did this impression on camera no
the normal women who are not Psychopaths
their heads will move like
this all right now it's a meme now it's
a meme
sorry it's called chicken head and it's
one normal women do not Psychopaths now
I have a theory why Psychopaths do not
move their heads as much when talking to
people here's my
theory if you were a normal person and
you are talking to an
object literally you're talking to your
printer would you move your head a
lot probably not because it's just an
object you would just say you stupid
printer why are you always out of
paper but if you talking to a person you
would want to impress them you with with
how engaged you are you'd want to hold
their attention and you so maybe you
would have a little more movement so my
theory is that Psychopaths don't move
their head when they're talking to
people because to them people are
objects so that actually makes sense to
me I don't know about the study but the
concept makes sense I'll look for that
I've never noticed it but I'll look for
it well the uh californ wine Industries
in the crapper it's a $55 billion
industry and it fell
8.7% in
2023 wait a
minute I didn't notice this the first
time I read
it it fell in
2023 do you want to do you want to
complete the story for me why this is
fake news
go all right the headline is that
alcohol consumption went down in 2023
go what's wrong with the
story it's the year after the
pandemic you can't compare anything in
2023 to anything in
2022
that's
that's how in the world did I not notice
this I was going to tell you that the
story is that people are drinking less
alcohol but but I didn't know this the
date when I first looked at it or I
didn't think think about the the date
being relevant yeah you can't tell
anything 2023 is in 2022 the whole
pandemic thing is just an outlier every
statistic that compares anything to that
time is ridiculous however I do think
that alcohol consumption is going down
this study
notwithstanding um and I think alcohol
is poison and I think people are feeling
it I think it might be a little bit of
substitute effect but I've got another
hypothesis about why wine consumption
might be going
down I heard somebody say online that
they might be using uh a type of
fertilizer that might be causing people
problems have you ever heard of
that I I don't have any evidence to back
that up I just since the comment I saw
and I wonder
if that whatever is poisoning the food
supply in general and I'm sure it is is
affecting the wine as well or the grapes
makes me wonder if people are just not
feeling as good after they
drink the reason you drink is because it
feels good but what if people are
drinking and they're not feeling as good
as they used to feel because the product
has
changed let's say there's a difference
in fertilizer that's what people are
alleging I don't have any information to
back that up but yeah makes me wonder if
they're just either more allergic to it
or something could be
speaking of uh things put in your body
that might be poison astroica is
withdrawing his vaccine
globally uh saying it's just for it's
commercial reasons it's economic reasons
it has nothing to do with
uh admitting recently that it shock can
cause potentially deadly blood clots
that's probably coincidental what the
real reason is it's just basic
commercial reasons come on people it's
just basic commercial reasons
don't act like it's some kind of
conspiracy and they found out that their
product might be more dangerous than
they hoped it's not that it's just basic
commercial reasons now what are the
odds that two completely different
vaccine platforms because the astroica
stuff was not the MRNA stuff so this is
what the Brits and the swedes and I
guess it's a British Swedish company so
this is the one they were taken two and
a half billion people took it I guess
so what are the odds that two completely
different
technologies that were both introduced
on
Rush in completely different countries
and different different
companies were both seemingly effective
but had this blood blood clot problem
it's that's a weird
coincidence would it be true that maybe
all rushed vaccines would have these
problems because two out of two I don't
know yeah know of course I'm only
speaking hypothetically because I don't
know for sure anything
scientifically but is it would seem that
a lot of people are complaining about
the risks of two completely different
platforms I'm not sure how to understand
that okay it's telling us something but
I don't know what
exactly well there's a new poll by the
Bab on B now this this is an important
poll you're probably listening to polls
from Gallup and it was zag be they're
okay too rasmuson you know you've heard
of them uh but the Babylon B has the
good stuff and they got a poll results
here it says a the Dead Worm found in
RFK Jr's brain is already polling higher
than Biden in 11 states now we don't
have information yet on the swing States
but I think it's looking good for the
Dead
Worm uh RFK Jr yesterday offered uh that
he would eat five more brainworms and
and still debate uh Biden and
Trump that's one of my favorite uh
political posts of all time you know of
course nobody nobody can match Trump for
political speech but for someone who's
not Trump that's one of the funniest
that's one of the funniest political
posts I've seen I do like
like nay I love that RFK Jr runs
directly into
danger like instead of saying oh it was
no big deal it was just a little
brainworm it's all taken care of he says
I'll eat five more brainworms if I and
debate Biden and Trump that's kind of
perfect kind of perfect now I don't know
for sure but I don't think he's being
advised like that that sounds like
something he probably just came up with
on his own
and to me humor is of course I'm very
biased a sign of
competence one of the reasons I think
Trump is capable is because he's funny
intentionally and uh when I see RFK Jr
being funny intentionally it improves my
opinion of his overall capability it's
just a it's just a natural bias you have
when you hear somebody being that funny
you think well if you can be that funny
you're probably kind of clever
well this brings me to my theme for the
rest of this um
presentation my theme today is that
Democrats are
realizing that they're the bad
guys and it's really could be
uncomfortable for a
while now I'm going to support that with
the following stories but remember the
overall theme is that Democrats are
waking up watching the news and having
this kind of feeling
oh
crap have I been supporting the bad guys
the whole
time yes you
have yes you
have all right here's some stories for
the day uh Google is allegedly they I
think they're complaining about this but
Google allegedly took down some uh Mega
prot Trump ads or critical of
Biden and that it's it's not like the
ads were you know over the top or
against the rules it wasn't anything
like that it was just an ad pretty
normal ad but uh Google allegedly took
it down but they say it was a technical
error or just an
error there's a lot of
Errors I feel like all the errors go in
the same direction oh oh we we
accidentally suppressed some
Republicans well we certainly weren't
trying to do that
intentionally it was an error oh you
caught us no you didn't catch us but
thanks for bringing it to our
attention yeah
completely totally an accidental error
kind of a
thing now I don't know if any Democrats
will hear that story and if they do hear
it are they going to say to themselves
oh it's probably just an
error probably just a ordinary mistake
means nothing
unless it was part of some larger
pattern a tapestry if you
will let's see if it is I shall
continue um but before we do that I'll
give you a little update uh yesterday I
uh was a guest on a podcast by Nicole
Shanahan you recognize her as the VP
choice for RFK
Jr and the I'll tell you when the
podcast is out should be pretty soon I
think you want to hear it it was
actually wasn't very political we got
into almost no politics a little bit at
the end so but it was more a general
stuff dilber stuff and things about my
life
and uh but there's but there was one
thing that
happened that I like to put into a story
that I like to tell everybody sort of an
advice you saw this advice first in my
book to
um had to fail almost every time and
still wi B so here's the
advice I like to have at least one thing
going on that would change the world not
very likely you know it would be a
really sort of unlikely event but at
least one thing a project or there's an
app you're working on or you know maybe
there's some persuasion I'm doing to try
to change things I I like to wake up
into a world in which it's possible
something amazing will
happen now it doesn't have to happen but
it really feels good to know that you
put something in motion even if it's
just buying a lotto ticket that's
probably why people do it right I don't
do it but it's probably why people do it
because they've got at least one thing
that could really go right but it would
be even better if the one thing that
could go right you did intentionally as
opposed to Pure Luck like a buy a lotto
ticket so here's what I
did um in a in a break after we were
done uh on air I taught Nicole a
speaking technique how to produce voice
up in the mask of your face instead of
down in your your throat and I asked her
to pass it along to RFK Jr and simply
ask him the question had he ever heard
that you can produce voice in The Mask
of your face as opposed to your throat
now I have a hypothesis and it's not
it's not it's a very low percentage play
but if it
worked his voice would be normal in 24
hours yeah and let me tell you the
technique just so you can hear it and
judge for yourself whether it make any
difference so before I got the surgery
to correct my own spasmo dysphonia
similar to what RFK junor has and he's
had a procedure on his vocal cords to a
different one that gave him some relief
but not
total the technique is this and I
learned this from a voice doctor
somebody who I spent a week with and
what he teaches you is to produce voice
in The Mask of your face which is the
sort of the mouth nose area and the way
you do that the way you find it is you
hum a happy birthday so if you go mhm
you can feel it humming in in your mouth
and your nose right and then you
immediately take the hum into uh words
and that's how you learn to speak up in
The Mask it it helps if you go up a tone
so um you've actually never
heard my natural speaking
voice because when I do presentation
style I take it up a tone
and uh and I also bring it up into the
mask of my face intentionally let me see
if I can even produce my natural voice
anymore um my actual my normal voice is
deeper so my actual normal voice is a
little bit deeper but it's not good for
producing good voice over a long period
of time because I'm using my vocal cords
so now I'm speaking from my throat
that's where the problem was my vocal
cords were the problem and as with RFK
Jr but
now I'll go up a tone and I'll bring my
voice up into my face so now you can see
that I'm producing perfect language and
it's about it's I'm supposed to hit an F
but I don't I get don't get as high as I
can I'm a little below F you the musical
not
F uh but that's what I trained on I I
trained with a tone machine in which I
would try to talk and and the Machine
would tell me if I'm hitting F and that
would help you keep your voice up in
your
mask so I I shared with her in 60
seconds the the technique and asked her
just to ask him just ask him if he was
familiar with it now that wouldn't be
enough necessarily to train him to do it
but if he got an interest in it and
wanted to follow up
there's a nonzero chance that in a week
he'll be speaking
normally now it's a very low chance very
low if I had to put on on it you know no
more than
5% but I like to have at least one thing
going on that could change somebody's
life doesn't have to be everyone's but
to me that's that's why you wake up like
that's that's the reason you wake up is
to see if you can change somebody's life
do something something big most of life
is a bunch of little stuff you got to
get done but you should have at least
one thing Brewing that could change
somebody's
life all
right there's a poll on a Washington
state which we don't think of as a red
state but uh Trump just pulled the head
of Biden 46 to 45 and if that result
held it would be the best result a
republican got in Washington state since
1984 now is Washington State a
signal is it the first Robin of
spring it might be because we do think
Washington state is the Lefty left and
if Trump pulls ahead in the Lefty left
State it's a it's a
landslide I use the word Landslide today
on for the first time um in in a serious
way I've talked about it being potential
but now all the signals are Landslide it
it just went from I don't know it might
be a landslide possibility remote
possibility and now it's just flashing
hard Landslide Landslide land and I'll
tell you more of the signals but it's
unmistakable at this
point Anything could happen you know
there could be some big new news or
somebody has a health problem anything
could happen but if you straight line it
from this point it's
Landslide and not just
Landslide I'm talking the landslide of
all landslides it might be the biggest
in the history I don't know what the
biggest has ever been Reagan I guess but
I think he could beat that it's it's
within the realm of
possibility let's see the uh who said
this the international monetary fund
said that a surge in Immigration has
made the US economy more competitive by
preventing wages from rising more than
they otherwise would
have yeah that came from the head of the
international monetary
fund yeah yep um that's all good news
that we kept our wages Low by bringing
in other people to take our
wages you know I have a similar feeling
about
muggers when I see a Mugger gets a
really good score like a nice fat wallet
I say to myself well that's good that's
stimulative to the economy because that
mugger income is going up so it always
makes me happy when a Mugger makes a
good
kill oh
wait
wait I'm what AM have I been analyzing
that mugging thing
wrong I just now realized that the
person who gets mugged is losing exactly
the same amount of money
well now that makes me look at this
immigration story completely
differently if the immigrants are
getting the
wages there's somebody not getting the
wages
huh I'm starting to doubt
experts well more good news for you
stormmy Daniels will be will be back on
the The
Stand could there be any happier news
than another day of Stormy Daniels after
we know that Trump literally her
until she was unconscious and she says
she might vote for him now I don't think
he could have had a better day in court
honestly and I um I'm going to tell you
this story without a name this will be
an anonymous story but a uh a a woman
messaged me laughing that after hearing
the Stormy Daniels
story that the Democrats are trying to
make Trump look like a less good leader
by proving he's he's the ultimate alpha
male I'm sorry but everything about that
story made me like him better
period let me ask you
this you got two choices and the only
thing you know about them is this one
 is Pan on the way to the hell
helicopter and eats ice cream because
it's easier than talking the other one
 a porn star until she was
unconscious and uh has uh goldplated
nail
clippers which one of them do you want
to negotiate with
potin I'm going to take golden na nail
clippers the porn star until she
was unconscious going to take it every
time yeah I'm I'm going to pick that one
every
time it it could not have been a better
day th this is when the Democrats have
to learn the term already baked into the
cake yes Trump is a billionaire who's
had some
sex it's true people believe me it's
true I know I know you're all surprised
it was a little bit baked into the
cake don't you think and finding out
that Trump is exactly who you thought he
was even behind closed
doors that's not hurting
him I love this story more stormy more
stormy anyway uh we hear that the
misinformation blob is back so you know
the Twitter files and Mike Benz in
particular been telling you about this
vast network of uh you know FBI and sisa
and all all these bad people who are
trying to manage the information
architecture of the world so that they
could send you a bunch of which
they called correcting misinformation
but of course they were a misinformation
entity uh but it looks like they're all
reconstituting now
uh so the Democrat uh Senate Intel chair
says that they're they're reorganizing
the FBI say a and the Democrats are
reorganizing again to once again create
a disinformation blob to control the
elections and it's not even hidden
because this came from the Democrat
Senate Intel
chair in
public nobody's hiding it it's just that
the Democrats haven't heard the news
that it's all it's all for the purpose
of misinformation creating it um is not
so much to reduce
it that's my take on it anyway that's my
opinion uh but that story is going to
get funnier in a
minute
okay just wait for that just hold that
one in your story hold that in your mind
that the the Democrats have created this
massive misin
information you know
entity just hold that thought we're
going to do some other things but don't
lose that one okay keep that there it'll
be funnier
later all right uh I saw a very funny
post by Joel poock uh I'll just read it
he says worth remembering that Barack
Obama also tried to withhold weapons
from Israel during the 2014 War also
started by Hamas the Pentagon ignored
him and sent weapons anyway uh I don't
think the Secretary of Defense enjoyed
explaining Joe Biden's crazy policy to
Congress a few bombs might go
missing do you think that might happen
that the military might just say this is
just stupid we're going to send them
some bombs nobody knows where they came
from I don't know it's possible I mean I
didn't know the story about that
happening in 2014 but I trust Joel has
those facts right and and uh
maybe maybe we'll find out that some
bombs got to Israel
anyway if any did it would be the
Precision Munitions that you could
defend you could defend having sent them
by them saving lives I mean you could
make the case you know you could make
the case against it but you could make
the case that the Precision mus
Munitions would be better than not
having
them all right um
according to the hill Joe Biden is
saying again I promise you Donald Trump
won't accept election results if he
loses now that's called priming you so
that you're primed to think that what
happened is the election results were
accurate and that he's a big old
insurrectionist that's priming to make
to make sure that if it happens you see
it under that condition that it was a
good election and he's a bad person
denying him and trying to take over the
country but uh here's what I would tell
you
um common
sense says that the level of corruption
that we can all
observe suggests that we couldn't
possibly have a a fair election so yes
if Trump is ahead in the polls clearly
ahead in the polls on Election Day and
he loses he's not going to accept the
results and neither will
I how many of you would accept the
results if he's ahead in the polls and
he loses would any of you accept that
result I
won't now that doesn't mean I'm going to
storm the capital I'm not going to I'm
not going to be cleaning my guns or
anything nothing like that but don't ask
me to
accept
 right the first taste I'm going
to spit it out don't try to shove it all
the way down my
esophagus no if the polling says Trump
should win and he loses again I am not
going to think that was a legitimate
election and you're going to have to get
rid of all the machines after that and
you're going to have to make sure that
you have paper ballots and you better
make sure that you fix this
because the country is going to get a
little upset if it happens again now do
you think that the Democrats are
starting to
notice a little bit
let me give you some
examples apparently Biden said that
deflation was 9% when he got into office
the real answer was
1.4% it makes me wonder if Biden gets
his own fake newspaper in the morning
because they can't trust him with with
real information like I don't think they
can go to him say you know all of the
data is bad now so
it's probably a bad day if they do I
feel like they've got a fake Washington
Post that looks like the real thing and
they put it on his desk but it's all
just made up because everybody's so
used to him thinking all the all the
numbers are
wrong and it'll be like the headline
Snickers candy bars 25% smaller than
before and he'll be like oh oh I'm going
to be all over that going to be all over
that all right
uh rasmason has a poll here on crime
issues and of
course uh it's exactly what you think it
would be 53% of likely us voters trust
Republicans to handle crime and law
enforcement issues only 35% trust the
Democrats
more a gigantic
difference now why do you
think uh the public by a large
percentage thinks Republican would do
better that could only be because the
Democrats themselves or at least all The
Independents have noticed that the
Democrats are lying about the crime
statistics how else could this be true
how else would so many people be
supporting the Republicans on the crime
unless Republic Democrats themselves or
at least like I said at least
Independents don't believe any of the
crime statistics that Biden is saying so
I think this is indicating that people's
are trusting their eyes and their own
experience over what the Democrats are
telling them that's a big deal because I
think that they used to think the
Democrats were telling them the truth
and the Republicans were lying I think
they figured out that nobody's telling
the truth
ever that's like the next level of
awareness the lowest level is that
you're side is telling the truth and the
other side is is lying it feels to me
like at least the independent voters
have have actually gone to a higher
level of awareness where they see what
their own team is doing to them that's
what it looks like to me let me give you
some more also from
raspon uh it's also an increase and that
increase of six points in the GOP since
February what would cause the GOP to
look better since February on crime it's
the campus
protests right that the main thing that
happened is the campus protests because
the City crime is probably the same in
February as it was in April but I think
people turn on the TV and they see the
campuses and they see that it's not
being dealt with and they say um I'm
pretty sure Republicans could take care
of that because they do they're actually
watching the Republican the repu repan
Governors just take care of it Am I
Wrong it would it be true to say that
every Republican Governor took care of
business everyone is that true I need a
fact check on that I'm not positive but
I feel like 100% of the problems were in
blue areas and every time it looked like
it would be a problem in a red area the
Govern just shut it down am I wrong
about that give me give me a fact check
that's what it looked like to me but
just an
totally all right well I'm waiting for
that I think that's
true also rasmon uh by almost a 41
margin more voters believe the problem
of violent crime in America is getting
worse Democrats told them the leaders
told Democrats that it was getting
better but by 4 to1 more voters believe
the violent crime is getting
worse again it would strongly
suggest that Democrats have under stood
they were being lied to by their own
team in other words they went up to the
next level to realize their own team can
lie to them that that's sort of when a a
child realizes that Santa Claus isn't
real and you say to yourself wait a
minute my parents are supposed to be on
my side and they told me something that
is quite obviously
 and then you go to the next
level of awareness as a child
that anybody could lie to you even your
parents and that's very useful now
Democrats apparently didn't fully get
that lesson the Santa Claus lesson and
they were believing that their preferred
news sources were telling them the truth
and their nonpreferred news sources were
lying they were half
right and they're just realizing their
preferred news sources were lying to
that that's a big deal and it's great
for the country great for the country
it's a hidden greatness but there could
be nothing better than Democrats
realizing they've been lied to basically
it's the one thing I want for Christmas
if I could have one thing for Christmas
it would be for Democrats not even to
change their minds I'm not even asking
them to change their preferences or
their minds I just simply want them to
know that their new sources have been
lying to them
massively and
forever I'm not telling him to go look
at Fox News or something else to get a
better view I would tell them to
triangulate you should at least check it
on both sides you know that's good
doesn't mean either one of them is
telling you the truth the full truth
right when I say when I say they're not
telling you the truth it's usually a
context thing some context being left
down all right let's move on Boeing 737
crashed after failing to take off at an
African
airport do you think that if a story
happened that sounded like other stories
that have happened recently a Boeing 737
problem do you think that if the story
was that it was a Boeing 737 and they
had a problem after takeoff at an
African airport do you think somebody's
going to say this is a Dei Dei problem
yes they
are yeah is it a Dei problem I don't
know I have no way of knowing no no
information so I I don't make that
allegation I think that would be too far
however I do point out that
Dei does make your brain go first to
that's the problem because it's simple
to understand and that has always been
the risk of Dei it's easy for everyone
to understand so when things go wrong
what does your brain go to First it goes
first to whatever is easy to understand
now we don't know anything about you
know the Boeing
737 transair African operation we don't
know who they employ or what they do or
how they train nothing we don't know
their overall safety record maybe it's
great the story doesn't say their
overall record maybe their overall
record is terrific you know that would
be important to know
my take on the story is not that we know
anything about the cause of the crash
either Boeing or the pilot or anything
else the only thing I'm telling you is
if your first thought was it's a Dei
problem that's the problem with Dei it's
your first thought
now I gave
up my entire career to make this
point
essentially if you you don't understand
the impact of Dei on the
non uh let's say on the white population
and the people are not benefiting from
it that would be the Asian-American
population as well if you don't
understand the impact on the on your
fellow
citizens and how it changes their
thinking and their actions then you
haven't fully evaluated the cost benefit
of
Dei I don't think anybody well somebody
does I'm sure but the the population in
general is sort of on board with
diversity being a good thing I don't
know anybody who disagrees with that at
the concept level you know there there
are some there are some but generally
speaking that the country is way on
board with we are diverse country we
should look like it but how you get
there should be natural that would be my
take how you get there should be by
fixing it at the children's education
level
if you fix that then the pipeline gets
stronger you've got more choices and in
a very natural way the free market will
choose you know good employees who are
well trained and you know so it should
work out but we're not even we're not
even approaching it like a system
problem remember I told you that systems
are better than goals the goal is more
diversity but there's not a system
there's no system to support it
except punishment punishment is not a
system I mean is sort of The Last Resort
system I guess but the system would be
oh let's fix uh young education so that
there are plenty of you know black
engineers and every other kind of
Engineers and women are going to stem
and if they don't want
to let's just say there's any kind of
you know natural inclination let's say
fewer women want to go into the stem
just because they're less interested I'm
not saying that's good or bad and nobody
else should either it might just be a
difference and if there are fewer women
in stem after you've completely fixed as
well as you can the you know the Early
Educational system so everybody's got
all the all the possibilities and
nobody's shut out and then it doesn't
happen well you don't have as much to
complain about them right if you've done
everything that makes sense and it
didn't work out that's just
then that's just nature coming
through all right
um uh RFK Jr was on MSNBC and it was uh
quite a fun thing to watch um but one of
the things that he said RFK Jr is that
he wouldn't rule out any January 6
Pardons and I don't think he used those
words what he said was he would look at
them individually as a trained lawyer
and make decisions individually and that
it would be unwise to make a larger
statement about um releasing them all I
think he got very close to nailing that
uh point but here's how it could have
been
better I I don't argue with the case I
don't argue with the point that you have
to look at them individually although
there are thousands so I don't know how
practical that is I think the stronger
message would have been this it looks to
me like the there's a political
prosecution element of this now you
don't have to say it is you don't say I
guarantee you these are all political um
political prosecutions you could simply
say I and many other people who are
observing it are very concerned that
these are political prosecutions but I
don't want to make a blanket statement
because you can look at these
individually and decide if anybody was
violent for example so that would have
been way better answer because
Republicans would be happy knowing that
he sees it the same way they do which is
this looks political and I'm pretty sure
he does see it that way I haven't you
know I don't have any inside information
but I would guess like everybody else
who's not crazy it looks like a
political prosecution so say it say it
looks like a political prosecution but
you're not going to treat it like
they're all the same that's a message
that everybody can accept and then he
wins both ways right you you're not
going to see the Democrats complaining
because he looked at every case
individually where's the
complaint where's that
complaint so he was almost perfect on
that but a little tweak would have get
would have gotten in
there
um so uh Jeff Clark is uh talking about
Harry
Litman by the way if you don't follow
Jeff Clark on X highly recommended uh
because a lot of the lawfare stuff
especially is hard to sort out so there
are probably half a dozen people who are
tremendous as sorting it out and Jeff
Clark would be one of them it's it's
always a little deeper analysis but also
simple and clear but what he says about
Harry Litman I'll just read what he said
he said one of msnbc's leading joural
lawfare dark arts practitioners
that's a good turn of phrase that he's
one of their joural lawfare dark arts
practitioners that's kind of perfect uh
so apparently Harry Litman was on MSNBC
and confessed well this is Jeff Clark's
word confessed that stormy Daniel's
testimony yesterday does not matter for
the case against Trump and he said she's
just there for the quote
feeling now as Jeff Clark says take that
in that somebody on the Democrat side
who is really deeply you know let's say
knowledgeable about it says it was just
there for the
feeling now which which justice system
are you aware of in which uh somebody's
feeling that's not related to the
case is accepted the case now don't you
think Democrats see this they're
watching they're watching CNN and
they're watching one of their uh joural
lawfare dark arts
practitioners tell you that she was put
there just because it would it would be
basically uh
prejudicial against
Trump do you think they hear it I mean
they're saying it pretty directly that
she was put on there just to make the
jury feel bad about Trump and it wasn't
related to the to the case I think they
see it not all of them but I feel like
they're starting to see what's going on
outside of their little
bubble this is going to get better by
the way you you don't want to turn this
broadcast off yet I got a big close oh
I'm going toward a big
finale you you'll want to stay for
that all right well I think that's
completely true but uh there's another
story where Scott Jennings on
CNN who I have mixed feelings about
Scott Jennings on
CNN number one you know they always try
to put a at least one voice for
Republicans but they they try to pick
somebody who's not going to destroy them
they try to pick somebody that they feel
like they can best them in
arguments so remember when Steve Cortez
was sort of their designated Republican
and and he got fired when he called them
out for the fine people
hoax so Steve Cortez a little too
capable a little too capable a little
too honest they couldn't have him so
he's out of there but Scott Jennings
does seem to uh have a good control of
the Republican
arguments however he seem this is just
my impression all right I don't mean
this to be an insult it's just an
impression he seems to understand his
job better than Steve Cortez did and I
mean this as a compliment to Steve
Cortez like he just went there and told
the truth and it didn't work
out but uh Scott Jennings the vibe I get
from him is that he understands he can't
go too
far like I don't think you would ever
see him say you know the bleach thing
was a hoax and it's all just a bunch of
hoaxes I don't think he would go that
far because he would get kicked out of
your job so this is also not a criticism
to him because I'm going to give him the
biggest Applause in a moment for what he
did what it feels like and again this is
just an impression so I'm not a mind
reader I don't know what anybody's
actually thinking but here's what it
felt like it felt like Scott Jennings
was just waiting for his
moment and it just
came here's his moment now keep in mind
that he's been rope a doing for years
you know the Rope a do strategy where
it' be uh Muhammad Ali would let the
other guy uh punch him and punch him and
punch him and he wouldn't punch back but
he was just tiring the guy's arms out
and then when the guy was tired he'd
just take him out so it feels like Scott
Jennings rope adoped CNN and here's what
happened um he said that uh Trump being
impeached for withholding authorized Aid
to
Ukraine in return for a political favor
the political favor would be he wanted
zinsky to investigate the
bidens and he was going to withhold a
withhold support now he didn't actually
withhold it which is also important to
the
story but he was impeached for
it so Scott Jennings points out that
Biden is withholding authorized Aid to
Israel also for political purposes to
Plate his base because there's an
election coming up
so Trump withheld aid from Ukraine in
return for a political favor that would
help him in the
election and Biden withheld uh is
withholding bombs from
Israel to Plate his base to win an
election so he says
this which is the ultimate knockout
punch
but but David Axelrod who's sitting next
to him you know sort of a famous
mouthpiece for the
Democrats he's totally knocked out he's
laying on his back on the Ring Scott
Jennings is standing over him with not
with not a bruise on him he's looking
down and poor Axel Rod is like but the
analogy doesn't
hold do you know when the analogy does
hold always that's why it's an analogy
if it were exactly the same thing he'd
say well it's exactly the same thing but
here's the problem the Democrats have
been teaching their base that analogies
is how you
think hold on just put this together the
entire Democrat base has been trained
for years that analogies are how you
think let me give you an
example that Trump he talks like a Mafia
Boss therefore by analogy logically he's
also a Mafia
Boss Trump sometimes use uses some
language such as you know dictator for a
day so he's acting like a a dictator in
some minor ways therefore logically by
anal ology he must be a
dictator people who protested on January
6 and sometimes when violent things
happen it's an
Insurrection so by analogy it must have
been an
Insurrection they've trained their
entire base to think that analogies are
thinking Scott Jennings comes in drops
on them the analogy of all analogies
the killer knockout punch of all
analogies and David Alex Rod can only
say the analogy doesn't
hold oh my God Scott Jennings I hope you
enjoyed your time as CNN because your
ass just got
fired it might take a while might take a
while because I don't think they want to
do it the same week he he knocked out
their entire network but good job Scott
Jennings you waited you waited
hold
hold
hold
hold you know this is exactly the same
thing that Trump got impeached
for and we're
done CNN Aaron CNN's Aaron Bernett had a
long interview with Biden in which she
absolutely crushed him he was destroyed
in front of the
public do you think the CNN would have
destroyed Bo but and the conversation
was about the uh economy and I'll give
you some details do you think CNN would
have destroyed
Biden unless there was a shift
happening let me let me tell you some of
the things that
happened um
Aaron Bernett says uh voters by a wide
margin trust Trump more on the economy
are you worried that you're running out
of time to turn the economy around Biden
says we've already turned it around the
polling data has been
wrong
wow um then grocery prices are up 30%
that's a real day-to-day pain that
people
feel that was CNN Aon Bernett Biden
responded they have money to spend and
their Snickers bars are getting smaller
so it's really the corporation in
agreed imagine being a
Democrat and you've chosen your
Champion the best of the best Biden's
representing you he's like an accessory
you know you know if you were to wear
earrings and the earrings were stupid
and ugly well that would make you look
bad but uh Joe Biden is your
earrings and uh how would you like to
know that your Champion was sent out to
uh make his best case about the economy
and the only point he could land was
must Nick or bars look
smaller must nicker bars are
smaller that was his that was all he had
his candy was
smaller wow
so let's see uh these are things that
Daron Bernett pointed out on live TV
voters trust Trump more in the economy
housing prices have doubled real income
is down after inflation GDP is down
consumer confidence has hit a
low she just she destroyed him if if you
could have seen his face you have to
watch his face he he knows he's dying
right in front of you his face is I am
dying right now it it's funny to watch
now here's what's
funny that they left him in the game the
Democrats couldn't figure way to take
him out of the game so they they're
leaving him in the game and he is
destroying their party absolutely
destroying
it at the same
time remember those 91 counts like
against Trump 91 counts my God what a
felon that man must be well let's do a
little update on all of the law fair
against Trump let's see you got four
cases and three of them have been
delayed probably until after the
election three of them will be
irrelevant if they continue to be
delayed past the
election so three of the cases that made
up the 91 indictments
look like they were so
weak that in one case the marab the mara
Lago boxes case the the uh the thing has
been delayed indefinitely because there
are so many you know sub uh issues have
to be worked out some of those issues
are that the prosecutor apparently faked
the photos of classified cover sheets on
documents apparently there's some real
um some real issues of faking
evidence then the J January 6 case is
delayed until the Supreme Court rules on
immunity then there's the prosecutor
fonny Willis who's being considered for
being removed from the case but hey at
least the Democrats have one
left they have one case left that might
you know maybe get a
result it's Stormy
Daniels it's the one everybody's going
to remember
let me let me summarize this for you
because I'm a good
summarizer summary 91
indictments summary what do you
remember I remember that Trump has
goldplated nail clippers and the
brains out of Stormy
Daniels that's all I
remember and then blah blah something
about
paperwor even the even on CNN their
guests are saying there's been no
evidence of a crime
and that they're bringing her up there
to make him look bad no evidence of
crime she said she'd vote for him maybe
she hasn't ruled out voting for
him now Trump has two accusations of you
know sexual
impropriety one was that EEG Carroll who
said she might vote for him and after
the alleged incident said that the The
Apprentice was her favorite TV show does
that sound to you like
a
victim a weird kind of victim do you
think that Democrats are so thick that
they're not noticing any of this they
haven't noticed any of it they don't see
that the 91 counts are completely
falling apart and the only case that's
even you know going to be proferred
before the
deadline seems to be the stupid one the
one that literally has no evidence if
you were going to create a situation to
prove that the Democrats are corrupt and
using lawfare to take out Trump this
would be it they have demonstrated
everything he claimed about them to be
true you don't think they
noticed they might have noticed polls
are suggesting and CNN's turn is
certainly making a
difference I would say MSNBC has not
made the turn so MSNBC still thinks the
economy is great and Joe Biden's just
just ideal CNN couldn't take it anymore
I think CNN just broke and they just
said okay we can't we're GNA have to
start telling the truth a little bit
here
so who do you want dealing with Putin
I'll tell
you
um now here's my big
close uh Trump has come out recently
against
the the effort toou speaker Johnson and
he also came out which surprises people
in favor of uh a huge expense for the
FBI's new
headquarters now the FBI as you know was
seemingly a mortal enemy of trump and
involved some say such as the news uh in
trying to remove him from office with
you know fake
claims and he's still going to build him
a big old
office how explain
that how how do you explain that he's
not in favor he says he loves uh MTG
Marjorie Taylor green but he's not in
favor of Ting
Johnson well Mike cerovich had a
hypothesis uh which I find provocative
and
likely which is that the people who
really run the country you know the
people in the intelligence groups and
the military and whoever really is
calling the shots behind the scenes
have uh already told Trump that he's
going to get the job and that they've
decided to release on
Biden why would that happen
Israel yeah it's probably exactly what
it looks like Biden is not as pro-israel
when when it comes to war which is the
time you really need to be on their side
or not right it's time to decide who
your allies are and uh Trump knows who
who his allies are you could disagree or
agree but he knows who they
are and uh it would look to me that the
powers behind the scene have decided
that they're going to take Biden out and
it looks like they'll just use the media
to do it the CNN could do it by itself
so probably just a few newspaper
articles Washington Post New York Times
CNN MSNBC might follow but they don't
need to and it would just be enough to
guarantee that uh Trump gets in there
so um my take is that that's probably
true the look for the signs the
indications are that the whoever the
real powers are in this country have
decided that they could work with
Trump and they probably made a deal I
think they made a deal now if they did
and if Trump made a deal with the bad
guys is that a problem
well a lot of people would think it
would be and I'm going to go um counter
to
that the reason that you like Trump if
you like Trump is that he's a
dealmaker the reason you like Trump is
that he could make a deal with Putin the
reason you like Trump is that somehow
the mafia couldn't even influence Trump
apparently I mean according to one of
the mafia people like he was like the
one guy they couldn't influence right
right so you want a dealmaker you want
somebody who could go shake hands with
Kim Jong gun that's why people like him
if you want a dealmaker you want a
dealmaker if he made a deal to keep the
bad guys off his back so he could go
into office because the bad guys have
decided he's the better
play especially in regards to
Israel if that's what happened and has
every indication looks like that then is
that bad for Trump to essentially agree
to an arrangement in which he would have
power come back into power but that he
would uh maybe build the FBI a new
building maybe he wouldn't dismantle
everything that should be dismantled
according to you maybe he could get in
there and fix a bunch of things he could
control for example you know the animal
spirits of the economy he has good
control of that so it might be that the
powers that be care uh about Israel
enough especially during war that they
can't take a chance of a wishy-washy
Israel supporter being president and
that the other stuff is lesser
priority now the real tell will be if
Trump says something about Ukraine that
you weren't
expecting that would be the
confirmation for example if Trump came
out and said tomorrow yeah we've got to
fully fund Ukraine uh because that's the
only way we'll Prevail or something like
that you'd say to yourself has he said
that before so here's what I'd be
looking for I'd be looking for whether a
deal has been struck let's call it the
Mike cernovich
hypothesis
and the the early signals are that
that's exactly what
happened I don't think that's a problem
because you have to you have to compare
it to the
Alternatives and the
alternatives are not
good you Biden is President not good not
good so I think they would allow Trump
to close the border I don't know if you
know Biden even has control of any of
that
really so it could be good I wouldn't I
wouldn't hold it against them
necessarily if some arrangement has been
made where they'll allow him to get into
office and not rig the election I do
believe that there are entities in the
United States if if they haven't rigged
an election I guarantee you that it
exists because I can't believe that our
intelligence people would be so pathetic
that they wouldn't know at least how to
rig the election they should at least
know how and how to get away with it
whether they do it is a separate
question but they should know how how
and I would think that at this point
they may have told Trump that they're
not going to rig the election against
them and that would be enough for him to
know he's going to get it and that would
be enough for him to get a little
flexible about some of the things the
Deep State needs such as more weapons
for Israel more support for Israel and
uh build an FBI building maybe a few
other things maybe the other possibility
is let's say let's say it's not that the
other possibility it's just Trump being
smart if Trump plans to go hard at the
FBI leadership when he's elected
wouldn't it be better if he had also
approved a giant new headquarters for
all the people in the FBI that he's not
mad at wouldn't that be better that
would be a very trumpian approach to
make sure that you've
satisfied the same group that you're
attacking that's how he did North Korea
North Korea was heyy you're my friend
you know but I'd have to kill you with a
nuclear weapon if things went too far
right so he does I'm your friend at the
same time I will you know obviously I'll
Crush you if I have to but you're my
friend you're my friend hey friend what
can I do for you can I build you a new
building I'm going to crush your
leadership yeah so that would be very
trumpian too and that would not require
that he reached any deal what about the
uh speaker Johnson thing
well that would be a case of him just
siding with a majority wouldn't it my
understanding is that most Republicans
don't want to remove the speaker yet so
would it be a problem if you're running
for president as a Republican and you
side with most
Republicans well you might say hey but
he should fight on principle no not
really you the time to fight on
principle is when you're not running for
office or you're already in office
right if you're running for office
winning is pretty high on the list of
things you ought to get right and if you
can't win by being you know fully
transparent well it's not a perfect
world all right so ladies and gentlemen
I contend that the Democrats have
figured out that their guy is gone I
think the CNN is
completely uh and and largely because of
Israel I think CNN has turned
on um Biden I think that at this point
if nothing
changes which is a silly thing to say
because everything will change between
now and November a million years will
pass and a million things will happen
but if nothing changed from this moment
it's a
landslide and Trump is guaranteed to be
president if nothing changes but again A
lot's going to change so I I will uh I
will keep my option to uh update that
but at the
moment he's got a rocket on his ass and
he's going to be your
president I don't think anything could
stop it short of you know something
really extraordinary which might happen
which might
[Music]
happen all right that's my
take and it it does assume that the
election will be fair or fair
enough or or that he has such a lead
that it it's an un unbeatable unable
lead I'd like to uh say again how much I
appreciate the RFK Junior's in the
race
and I don't know what he thinks about
his ultimate odds are
winning but I I told uh I told Cole
shanan yesterday that she's three
heartbeats away from the
presidency because you got two people at
a certain
age and you've got one person who
doesn't have so security you know he
doesn't have the Secret Service
protection so she's a lot closer to
being president than any of us want to
admit you know what I mean now it would
it would take some extraordinary it
would take a sequence of extraordinary
events to happen but all of those
extraordinary events are within within
the field of probability you know
they're not most likely but they're
within the reasonable realm of of things
Biden could be taken out you know just
by quitting because he's you just can't
make it that's possible uh RFK JR could
be you know at the last minute the only
Democrat hope that's possible at the
same time you wouldn't have security or
sufficient security
so he's he's a he's a risk that way
Trump is a risk just because maybe he's
got some enemies who have something
terrible in mind or because uh he's also
a certain age anything can happen at
that
age so yeah there there could be tons of
surprises between now and November and
they're not necessarily all going to be
good ones so that's my take Democrats
have figured it out they know they have
a losing candidate at the moment Trump
has a uh has a vice grip lock on the
election and I think it's such a lead
that they can't cheated it away from him
but don't want to I I believe that the
the events in Israel and the Scott
Jennings framing of this being an
impeachable offense for um for Biden is
very persuasive and if the Republicans
are smart they're going to take the
Scott Jennings framing and just go crazy
with it and by the way I'm embarrassed
that I didn't think of it why did why
did it take Scott Jennings to mention
that have you heard of that before has
anybody said that before he did I didn't
seear I didn't hear anybody else say
that it's a it's sort of a Perfect
Analogy as analogies
go very strong all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all I've got for you
today today is going to be an awesome
day for all of you you're really going
to enjoy it and
uh so go forth and uh be prosperous I'm
going to talk to the locals people
privately in a moment after I shut down
this feed so locals stay with me the
rest of you I will see you tomorrow for
more of the best live stream you've ever
