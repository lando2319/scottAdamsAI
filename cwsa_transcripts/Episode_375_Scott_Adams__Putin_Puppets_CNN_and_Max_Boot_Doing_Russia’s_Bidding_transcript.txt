Hey Jake hey ni come on in here I hope
you have your big pot of steaming
coffee CU it's time for it it's time for
coffee with Scott
Adams oh yeah
and if you're coming in here early
enough and you're prepared enough it's
possible that you already have your cup
your mug your Stein your chalis your
glass your container you have filled it
with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me for the simultaneous
sip
oh that's good stuff okay so here's the
best story of the
day the best story of the day today is
uh CNN's reaction to president Trump
denying that he is a Russian
asset now here's the way I was watching
uh Anderson Cooper report on that so the
president was asked if he's a
essentially a Russian asset and he said
no and here's how they reported on
CNN can you
believe we're even in this
world can you believe the president of
the United States needs to deny that
he's a Russian
asset that says it all everything you
need to know it's right there the
president had to actually deny that he's
a Russian
asset now what's wrong with this
story the reason the president has to
deny it is not the fault of the
president the reason he has to deny this
story is do I have my shirt on
backwards no the reason he has to deny
the story is because they made it a
story so
CNN creates out of nothing this
accusation and then they report that
when he he denies the ridiculous
accusation that the denial of a
ridiculous
accusation is evidence of
wrongdoing I think that's what they did
didn't they didn't they frame him and
then when he says no obviously that's
not true he
says then CNN says can you believe it
only only this President would have to
deny he's a Russian asset yeah
it wasn't his fault was
it I'm pretty sure it's because the the
uh the media keeps uh hammering on
it so uh I was just watching a clip of
uh Brook Baldwin CNN interviewing Max
boot who wrote a article in the
Washington Post now you might know that
the Washington Post does not love
president Trump at the moment
because he was just mocking them for uh
the recent news about Jeff bezos's
marriage and so max boot who is a of
course a Hillary Clinton person writes
an article of the
18 the 18 reasons that President Trump
might be a Russian
asset now if I've taught you anything
it's that the the laundry list
persuasion is your clear c signal of BS
all right if they had one good
reason that's all you would see you
don't need 18 reasons if you have one
good one if you have one good one that's
just all they talk
about but their list is this whole bunch
of sort of unrelated stuff in other
words it's stuff that other people did
they're actually trying to pin on the
president
conversations that other people had and
we're talking you know completely
unrelated stuff so when you see the
weakness of the
list remember this rule that if people
have one good reason they'll give it to
you and and they'll Hammer that One Good
Reason until you're dead but if they
don't have a good reason you're going to
see the laundry list of things which are
sort of in the general neighborhood and
if they were true but you can't tell and
if something more than what is in
evidence happened and possibly and this
doesn't rule out and you can't say it
didn't happen and it's this list of
complete
 that that they're they're
pushing so I think they've given
up it looks like CNN is given up on
Muller doesn't it seem that that like
that to you let me ask you this
if they thought Mueller was about to
come up with the goods on some kind of
Russia
collusion
uh do you think that they would be this
panicky cu cu they're they're creating
the news that they're reporting on
they're they're
literally you know they're they're
making you think that the news is not
them but they're the news pretty much
everything that's in the news is because
the news has accused somebody of
something they didn't do or made
something that they did that isn't that
important and seem like a bigger
deal uh so anyway uh what happened with
manufacturing
uh Max boot was born in the Soviet Union
is that even
true did I see nal's tweet not yet I
guess I'm going to have to go look at
that because every keeps asking me
that do you think Muller writing an
anti-climatic report is a misdirection I
don't know what you
mean all right so that was the only
interesting thing I saw in the news um
you know so
there's confirmation hearings for bar
but I don't know if that'll be
interesting
um will Dems ever give up their
collusion narrative no they will not so
you can see that they're setting the
stage now to retain the two movie
solution after one of them should have
gone away so it looks pretty clear that
they're Panic that the whole Russia
collusion narrative is going to
evaporate when Mueller does his report
uh and I think they're setting us up for
yeah maybe Muller couldn't find it but
look at all these laundry list of
reasons that it must be true anyway so I
think that they're going to be at odds
with the Muller report which will be
hilarious I think I'll just get rid
of whoever that
is um
so the Clemson dinter at the White House
wasn't interesting to
me oh is the uh are we going to see a
boxing match between uh Mike xovich and
Tom
Arnold is that really going to happen I
think somebody put some money up I can't
really see it
happening but um you know i' I've met
Mike cernovich in you know in person and
I wouldn't want to box
I'll tell you if if Tom Arnold really
wants to box him uh it would be I think
it's going to be a short fight
because Mike's pretty
ripped anyway that would be very funny
to
watch you've heard of Andrew Yang yet I
have
not um so I tweeted out three links on
the question of climate change which all
of course conflict with each other and
are
impossible uh pretty much impossible to
sort out for non-scientists so I'm
letting people wrestle with that a
little bit and see if I can learn
anything
um I'm just leave your comments now is
it
[Laughter]
yes Tulsa gabard is getting destroyed by
her own
side so I'm still waiting to see
who um who will be the preferred
candidate for CNN because that's all
that matters CNN will effectively decide
who your
Democratic um Nomine nominee is now you
might think it's someone else but it's
really not CU whoever CNN decides to
support um and I suppose msnbc's in
there but they'll probably get on the
same team at some
point I don't think it'll be Biden now
what about uh um Julia julan
Castro now here's the most interesting
thing about julan
Castro um first of all he can deliver
Texas perhaps which would be the
difference between winning and losing so
he's he's got a strong you know natural
base both in Texas as well as you know
would he get most of the Hispanic vote
probably so so he he's a pretty pretty
strong candidate but here's what's
interesting he has a he has an identical
twin could you imagine being who was in
a congress as well can you imagine being
julan
Castro's identical twin iful became
president if you were the identical twin
of the president of the United States
and you just went to the mall and you
went
shopping what would
happen wouldn't this is a serious
question would the identical twin have
to have full Secret Service protection
if his brother became president I think
he might right because because the real
president of the United States couldn't
really just walk down the
street it would be too dangerous there'
be you know somebody would would try
something so if he's got an identical
twin who literally looks like him I
haven't seen them I assume they you know
if their haircuts are the same Etc but
the identical twin is going to have to
grow a beard or something because if you
walk down the street and people would
say that's the president of the United
States I hate his politics get him
uh so that's
funny and here's the better
part would there be any rule against the
repu the
nominee uh picking his twin brother as
his vice
president what if julan Castro selected
literally his twin brother to be his
vice
president you would probably say to
yourself well in terms of character
same guy in terms of background and
demographics same guy and in terms of
government experience well he's a
congress person right the brother is an
experienced politician for a major State
Texas there's nothing that would stop
him from running with his twin
[Laughter]
brother which would be fun somebody says
it's not legal is that true is there any
law against having your brother be your
I mean there was no no rule about
Kennedy making his brother his uh
attorney
general Castro Brothers have ruled
before yeah that Castro name might work
against
him
okay
um can't be from the same state oh is
that true
huh I never knew
that I need confirmation of that but
could
be
um I did not see a speech in which van
Jones said something
about Hillary is that new that doesn't
sound like it's something
new oh so Laura lumer I I haven't seen
the video but apparently Laura lumer uh
went to Nancy Pelosi's
wall and what what did she do bring some
illegals and try to have them climb her
wall or something I didn't I didn't know
what happened but I'm going to catch up
on that today so that will be fun who's
winning the government
shutdown
well um I would
say that the public is largely not
caring so most of the public has thrown
their fellow citizen under the bus on
this if you think about it you know the
the public doesn't really care about the
800,000 people not getting paid they
only care if their team wins so I think
the public of the United States has
proven that we're all a bunch of
bastards I haven't seen I haven't seen
any citizens care about 800,000 of their
fellow citizens suffering from this it
just doesn't even seem to be a
topic all right I got nothing else to
say so I'm I'm going to keep it short
and I've got to talk to you later bye
for now
