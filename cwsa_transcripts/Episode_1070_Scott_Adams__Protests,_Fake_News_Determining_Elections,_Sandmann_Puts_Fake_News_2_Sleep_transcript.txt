[Music]
hey everybody come on in
it's time for another exciting and
amazing episode
of coffee with scott adams yep it's just
about the best thing you've ever seen in
your life
what is happening my security camera's
going off
there's a mouse outside i literally
picked up a mouse on my security camera
that's good security
so but enough about me what about you
how are you doing great yeah
good because it's a great day today and
it's just going to get better
and one of the things that will make it
better is a simultaneous set but i hope
you'll join me now all you need is
a copper bunga glass attacker challenger
stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing makes everything
better including pandemics economics you
name it
go
ah oh
let's talk about all the things
happening today
so yesterday trump signed uh for
are they executive orders i guess
then they're all designed to lower uh
pharmaceutical
costs in this country now there are
a few interesting things about this
aside from the fact
that wouldn't it be good to have lower
pharmaceutical costs
number one interesting thing why wasn't
this done before
even the president says should have been
done long ago
well he's been president for three years
so long ago also includes
the current presidency and so the
question is
why wasn't it done before now let me
i don't know the details of the
executive orders
but one of them is to have most favored
nation status which is fairly common
in contracts common enough that you know
people know it exists
and the idea is that uh we can't be
charged more in this country
than some other country so we don't want
to be
the ones who are subsidizing other
countries by paying high costs
so that some other country could have
low cost that's pretty basic
contract stuff but the government had
not been involved
rather these were you know private
companies doing private things
so why is it that now the president can
make this kind of a change
which seems to comply to all
common sense and on the surface it looks
like just a smart thing to do
why'd it take so long same with buying
from canada
apparently we'll have the option now of
getting some meds from canada where the
prices are lower
which is similar to the most favored
nations thing and then a few other
things that
do the same thing and here's what i
think it is but i need to see some
reporting on this by smarter people
yeah you're saying in the comments uh
where i was going
could you tell i was teasing for the
answer
because i think the answer is that the
supreme court
has upheld enough executive orders from
the past
and i think it was with daca and maybe
obamacare
so that's the part of murky on so
somebody can fill me in on the supreme
court part of it
but i think what's happened is that
trump has discovered he has more power
as a president than anybody would have
imagined
meaning that the supreme court has now
set a standard
that says that trump can do this now
because he's doing this that's about the
same size
of this-ness of other things that the
supreme court
has allowed and so it gave him room to
operate that didn't exist before
so here's the fun part the supreme court
by voting
against the president's wishes a few
times
has turned him into the dictator that
nobody wanted
but as long as he's a benevolent
dictator it's going to be okay
and the same with obama right obama did
some big executive orders
but as long as society looked at them
and said yeah
well your intention was good and a lot
of people do like it
not everybody agrees but it's not like
the worst thing in the world
the supreme court can let that stand so
uh you can you can never underestimate
no you can never overestimate i always
say it wrong i tweeted that wrong this
morning
um there's there's a big impact of
the uh what do you call it the the
accidental consequences
of anything and the accidental
consequences
of the president losing a few supreme
court battles
is that he can lower our health care
costs
yeah you could never underestimate thank
you
that's what i should say so the the
accidental consequences
the unintended consequences were to give
the president
more power and then he took his power
and he solved one of society's biggest
problems with it
thank you for unintended yes um
now who saw that coming who who on their
prediction card
said president will lose
important supreme court cases and that
will allow him to
lower our drug costs what
and you're going to see a lot of
exciting things i think happening
as we get closer to election day
because the president has this one
gigantic advantage
and it's enormous which is the president
can do things
whereas joe biden can't do things so the
president doesn't have to just
talk about lowering drug costs he can
just do it
and apparently he's well on his way to
doing it we'll see if this stuff holds
but i'll bet it will um you all had a
good laugh
or i think celebrated silently when
uh covington kid nick sandman won
his his suit well he got he had a kind
of settlement
which is different from winning although
it's a kind of winning
and so this is his second win in a row
he won
he got a settlement i guess from cnn and
he got a settlement of
unnamed amount from washington post that
he's got a few more
outlets to sue and the basic idea here
is that
the the news the fake news painted him
as the bad guy
when in fact he was just standing there
and he was
sort of the one that was approached not
the one who was causing trouble
so his reputation got destroyed by this
sufficiently that a court
or at least you know it looked like it
was it was something he could win
sufficiently that the other side decided
to sell
so that's how bad it was so this raises
an interesting question
and it goes like this could somebody
who had lost their job or had been
attacked let's say physically attacked
and i guess there were a few of them
even last night at the protesters
at the protest if if people who are
trump supporters are physically attacked
or
fired for being trump supporters here's
the question i ask
the legal experts could those people sue
the fake news
for the fine people hoax
and for the you know the covington kid
hoax and the russia collusion hoax
in other words could you say the reason
i lost my job
for being a trump supporter is because
the fake news
has run enough hoaxes that i'm demonized
just for being a supporter
i lost my job could they make the case
that the media by knowingly running
hoaxes and of course the
fine people hoax is the classic one
where you know they know the real answer
because it's in the transcript it's not
really an interpretation
problem it's right there you just read
it
so could you win a case
against the same fake news companies
if you had been abused in any way for
being a trump supporter
because i i think it's a pretty solid
line from from there
speaking of which uh rasmussen
uh who does polling which you rarely
will hear mentioned on the news
apparently rasmussen is banned from
being mentioned on
the news did you know that and i think
it's banned on both
on both the left and the right now they
claim
and i think there's evidence to support
it to be the most
accurate polling company in the country
for political stuff
now is that true is that true i think so
i think they're the most accurate and
they can't be mentioned so
there must be a counter argument to that
but i don't know what it is but one of
the things that
rasmussen tweeted this morning is that
if you look at what people believed
during the 2018 midterm elections
you'd find that 30 just before the vote
for the midterms in 2018
30 of the country believed the russia
collusion
hoax 30 of the country believed it
and that includes republicans
now if 30 percent of your country
believe the fake news
that that russia was controlling the
president
what would you expect the midterm to
look like
you'd expect it to look like it did
people would vote in democrats because
they think the president is owned by
russia
now think about how much that changed
the world
because because it probably flipped the
house
and i haven't even added the second part
if the only thing that happened
was the russia collusion hoax which you
had to know
that the media pushing it had some
suspicion it wasn't true
or no it wasn't true but they pushed it
anyway
what about the fine people hoax i would
say that the fine
people hoax was believed by maybe 70 of
the country when it first came out
wouldn't you say i would guess that 70
percent of the country
because that includes a lot of
republicans believed the fine people
hoax now that's quite that's changed
quite a bit
i tweeted this morning because i you
know i periodically tweet that it's a
hoax
and a phd doctor type guy
who wrote a anti-trump book weighed in
to say
it's not a hoax darth dilbert
see that's the funny part because my
critics call me dilbert
but he called me darth dilbert so that's
like really really funny
very clever and
he was not aware according to his tweet
that it was a hoax
and i thought to myself how could you be
an educated
person in the united states and think
that the fine people hoax was real
now in 2020 i totally get why people
believed in in 2018
because it was fresh and it was being
misreported
but after two years of unraveling this
thing you'd think most people would know
it's a hoax by now
but think of those those two hoaxes the
russia collusion hoax
and then i would call it the tentpole
race hoax because everything else about
trump
would seem different if you took away
that
that one thing that they think they got
the smoking gun on
right because everything else is sort of
a well
30 years ago there was that that
full-page ad about the
central park five so what about that
well if you were looking at it in
isolation and you had not heard
the fine people hoax and you're just
looking at it on its own you'd say
well he wrote an ad that says nothing
about race there's nothing in there
about race
it was about crime the people accused
happened to be black but it wasn't any
part of trump's point
so if you saw that in isolation you'd
say
yeah i can see why people are saying it
feels racist but there's nothing there
i mean there's nothing in what he did
that even you know
indirectly implies race
so if you take away the charlottesville
find people hoax
which is the one that people said ah
finally now we don't have to
read his mind anymore we don't have to
think he was thinking
something wrong even though he didn't do
things wrong we could
we know he was thinking bad things now
we have
the actual proof so once you have the
proof
it proves all the other things it's like
now that we've heard this we know all of
his secret
thoughts are confirmed so
i would say that those two hoaxes
actually completely determined
the midterm result and
that means that the fake news literally
is running the country at this point
if you're worried about uh foreign
interference
you should rethink that on a statistical
on a statistical basis because what we
have now
it looks like you probably have a russia
which wouldn't mind having trump again i
think
i'm not sure but it feels like it and
then you've got a
china that absolutely doesn't want trump
because biden is china friendly
so it looks like it's a contest between
china and maybe russia intelligence
to try to thwart the fake news
in this country which will otherwise
determine the election
so we have foreign interfec this is
literally true
we have foreign interference in our fake
news
which will cause the fake news to less
reliably
throw the election and make it
illegitimate
now i'm not coming out in favor of
foreign interference
i'm simply pointing out the irony that
it might be the only thing that could
save us
again not in favor of it i'm not making
i'm not making a pro-russian statement
i'm just saying that if the fake news
was going to do another 2018 job on the
country
and just completely rigged the election
by fake information
what if russia successfully interfered
with our election
in a way that thwarted the fake news
would that be bad in theory it would be
bad
hypothetically it would be terrible
to have foreign interference except that
our
domestic interference is far worse
right so sort of uh
two wrongs making a right situation
sometimes it works
senator tom cotton continues to make
news
he's good at making news and he wants to
ban a federal funding from any school
that has include
included the what is called the race
baiting 1619 project
in the curriculum now the 1619 project
1619 refers to the
first date of slavery i think uh the
beginning of slavery
and the curriculum would include the
fact that
the white the white race is quote
barbaric devils
and quote bloodsuckers
so tom cotton thinks that schools should
not give federal funding
if they're teaching that white people
are barbaric devils
and bloodsuckers i'm thinking to myself
that sounds pretty reasonable tom cotton
i have to say i haven't always agreed
with tom cotton
he's got some opinions that you know a
little
uh a little outside my uh range of
happiness but not this one
this one seems right down the center
like this one doesn't even look
right-wing to me
does it i like you could argue that this
is oh he's a right-wing guy
but not this this is right down the
middle
so will this get passed i doubt it but
i'm glad he's doing it
um here's an interesting story
that i don't know what to make of it you
know about the
uh the book and the movie plandemic
right
so you know that there's a a doctor
who's suggesting that
uh i guess there's going to be
a tv the sinclair local tv stations are
gonna air
and the sinclair stations by the way own
a lot of local tv stations so this is a
big deal
uh they're gonna air the pandemic
uh that it's a it's called a
researcher's conspiracy theory
now conspiracy theory is what you call
anything you don't agree with
so keep an open mind about what's a
conspiracy theory and what isn't
but the plandemic claims that
dr fauci uh was responsible for creating
the coronavirus
and they sent it to china and
it's so found she's responsible for the
coronavirus
now i suppose we live in a world where
anything's possible right anything's
possible
but um and and then other people weighed
in
and said that this is the most widely
debunked
conspiracy theory ever now i told you
before that
one of the authors of the pandemic
book lives locally around here
and he's lobbied me i think he sent me
three books so far
he's lobbied me to get him on here to my
periscopes which makes me uh think he
might be watching right now
so i can't heck it lively so i did get
your messages
and the reason that i haven't responded
is that i can't
vet this sort of stuff so
eric balling apparently had uh
you know the doctor on there recently
and he got some criticism for
not knowing ahead of time the other
things
that they had claimed etc and
i don't want to i don't want to make the
mistake that eric
bowling made which is putting on
one side of a controversial scientific
claim if i can't argue the claim
in other words if i don't know enough
about the topic or i could push back on
a claim
i don't want that person talking in
public
with you know my help because at any any
single claim and a context
uh looks persuasive so i don't have an
opinion about whether the planet is
totally debunked as other people say or
there's something to
part of it but maybe not all of it don't
know
but i'd also suggest that you don't know
and
for the fact that the sinclair stations
are going to run this
i think is completely irresponsible
unless it also runs something from the
critics
if it's balanced if they say well this
is what the experts say
here's what the plan dammit movie says
and let's go back to the experts and see
what they say if they do something like
that then fine
you know maybe it's a public interest to
know
to see both sides but i don't think
that's going to happen
let me give you a good example of what
happens when you only look at one side
of an argument
in the comments tell me was michael
jackson
totally definitely a child molester
or not in the comments tell me your
opinion and i'll tell you why i'm asking
this
i'm asking because this goes to my point
about how if you see one side of an
argument it's always convincing
if one lawyer gets the talk and the
other side doesn't get to talk
that one lawyer will will convince you
pretty much every time
i'm looking at your your comments about
michael jackson and you'll see that
they're mixed
which is what i was expecting you'll see
a bunch of yeses
you receive a bunch of no's now how can
it be
that we get to this point in time and
you've got a bunch of yeses and you've
got a bunch of no's
well let me tell you my experience i
went from
saying well gosh i don't know could be
true
could be true could be not true
and then i watched uh a netflix special
i think it was netflix in which uh he
showed
two of his accusers now adults telling
their story
now when you hear the adults telling the
story of what happened to them when
they're younger
it is a hundred percent credible
you could have it would be hard to watch
that documentary
and walk away thinking that jackson was
innocent
i mean it would be really hard it's
completely convincing
so therefore michael jackson definitely
a child buster right
very convincing except last night
i watched another documentary last night
i watched one called uh
square one and it was it took the other
side
and it went through the description of
how the initial
accuser made the accusation etc
and i don't want to give it away oh was
it an hbo special somebody's correcting
me
uh and was it something wonderland or
yeah that was the name of it so anyway
so i watched the the other side of it
and let me tell you the other side of it
that says he was not
a child molester is
100 credible
blew my freaking head off
if you had told me that there was an
other side to
this story after i'd seen the
completely convincing evidence that he
was obviously a child blesser
when you see the other side it'll blow
your head off
let me give you just a flavor of it and
let me tell you
you should watch this because if if you
believe that michael jackson definitely
is guilty
and i'm not going to say he is or not
i'm going to only talk about the quality
of the arguments
do i know anything yeah i wasn't there
it was not there
let me give you some examples
the very first accuser who ended up
ended up settling
when you hear the story of how that scam
came about
and you hear that even the kid didn't
think anything happened
he talked to his friends and said
nothing happened even after the fact
i mean when you hear the whole story it
really was just a con artist
who figured out a way to make michael
jackson pay
and here was the part of the story i'd
never heard before
and it goes like this there were two
court cases one was criminal and one was
civil so one tries to get money and one
is trying to see if
michael jackson goes to jail typically
the way you do those
is you do the criminal case first and
then depending on how that turns out
that gives you a basis to to do or not
do
a um a civil suit where you're trying to
get money
now the problem is that in the michael
jordan in the michael jackson
case his civil suit was on a
a faster schedule which meant
that he would have had to give away his
entire defense
in the civil suit before the criminal
case was run
and if you do that the experts say
that the criminal case people get to
craft and recraft
their case so that the defense doesn't
work
and therefore it's massively
unconstitutional
or at least unfair i think it's actually
passed constitutional muster since then
but in my opinion it's unconstitutional
because it guarantees an
unfair trial in the criminal case
guarantees it
it guarantees an unfair trial
and so michael jackson had the following
situation he could either settle for
something that definitely didn't happen
or he could risk going to jail because
he knew that his defense
would be laid bare in the in the civil
suit and when he went to criminal court
basically he would get eaten alive and
probably be convicted for something that
didn't happen
and so he settled once he settled
there became another thing that happened
and here's the key part
the fake news business at the time
was paying people who would come forward
and say that something bad happened
at michael jackson's house
what happens when you pay massive
amounts of money
to people who are willing to lie on
television
what happens you get a lot of people who
are willing to lie
on television and the ones who came
after were just
sort of obvious liars so now you've got
one case
the jackson settled because he got this
weird
legal bind that he just had to do the
same thing
that created the first story that
generated
fake news paying people for more stories
because they got a lot of clicks
so now you have a pattern and
when you say to yourself but what about
those you know the two older ones that
you saw in the other documentary
they're adults it doesn't seem like they
have anything to gain by
making something up well here's the
thing
they also have some connection to some
of the badness and they won't
give it away but they don't the the
documentary that excuses jackson
doesn't too directly deal with those
latest adult accusations
but it does completely eliminate the
bulk of the ones you've heard
and they are absolutely they look pretty
fake
the other ones who knows but let me give
you a little uh
a little anecdote here uh colleen
colleen mcculkin was saying this when
you hear the story that
uh michael jackson let children
they had been visiting sleep over in his
bedroom
what do you think you you see them all
in the same bed right
and here's here's a one of the stories
that colleen mcculken was saying he goes
the first thing you don't understand
is that michael jackson's bedroom was
two stories
it was two stories so you could be in
his bedroom
without even being in the same room and
he told the story about
some kid who wanted to sleep in in his
bedroom in his bed
and michael jackson asked one of the
adult staff members
to sleep in the room with him and the
the two of them slept on the floor and
let the kids
use the big bed now i don't know how
common it was for him to do that
but the fact that it happened even once
tells you that michael jackson was aware
that you don't want to be
alone with a kid in your bed did he ever
do it before i don't know
so here's the point i don't know what
michael jackson did or did not do
i do know that a huge part of that story
about what he did
looks completely not credible that
doesn't mean all the rest of it is not
credible
it just means that the fake news
basically destroyed this person
all right if you took the fake news
business out of the equation
michael jackson would still probably be
performing today i don't even know if
he'd be dead
so keep that in mind
uh you gotta you have to watch both of
those documentaries
if you don't watch them both you're
really not gonna get the feel of this
two-world situation um i saw
on social media but i'm looking for a
confirmation that something like
half of all coronavirus deaths happen to
diabetics
is that really true is it true that half
of coronavirus deaths are diabetics
and the diabetics are still walking
around
just like they have the same risk of
everybody else
i mean i would hope that they're hiding
pretty well by now
but it feels like we could really make
something happen if that's true
um there are also
two movies and two worlds about all the
protests if you look at
fox news you'll see lots of articles and
photos of things burning and things
being thrown at police and
and dangerous lasers uh blinding them
etc
a bunch of police have been literally
blinded
by these lasers from the protesters now
um i just
i i'm so angry about that in particular
it's one thing to get
hit with a blunt object i mean that
could be bad enough but to be blinded
just because you went to work
uh i don't know if the police just
opened fired on
on the protesters with the with the
i think they should shoot to kill
anybody who's got a laser that they
should that they're putting in people's
eyes
that's just my opinion now probably
would cause a lot of problems
it may be more problems than it solves
but i think if you actually
saw somebody aiming the laser
that no matter where that laser was
aimed if it's a deadly weapon
meaning that it will blind somebody i
think the police should be able to shoot
to kill
if they even see the laser you know the
the moment the laser comes out that
should be a shoot to kill situation
because it would be if it were a gun
right if somebody brought out a gun
that'd be a shoot to kill situation if
it looked like they were going to use it
if somebody brings out a laser to blind
a police officer
let me let me say as clearly as i can
possibly can
you put me on that jury that police
officer is free
put me on the jury that tries to convict
a police officer
for shooting somebody who has a blinding
laser that they
that they're is in their hand
you're a free man or free woman yeah you
put me on that jury
no way i'm gonna convict the cop for
shooting a guy with a laser that blinds
people
no way if you're wondering what's going
to happen with all their urban centers
i suggest you learn about insurance
and banking because when you see all the
shops that were destroyed by the the
looters in the urban areas you say to
yourself
well you know they'll wait for the
tension to go down
and then they'll rebuild or maybe other
people will come in
other tenants will take over and rebuild
but there's a problem you kind of need
insurance to have a viable business
if you need a bank loan the bank the
bank's gonna
want you to have insurance too so that
you're covered in case something happens
now insurance companies will often if
not always
exclude riots so riots
would not be covered by your insurance
now that was probably not a big problem
in the past
because when you're filling out your
insurance policy you're thinking
well what are the odds i'm going to lose
my business to a riot
you know that doesn't seem very likely
so you still buy the insurance
but would you buy insurance with no riot
protection
in the very places that have recently
been destroyed by riots
and no end in sight i would i would
suggest that you can predict what's
going to happen to
at least the retail parts of the inner
cities
by looking at banking and insurance
and entrepreneurs and how they manage
risk
and at this point the risk is just too
high
and that's going to persist for years so
i don't see any situation in which the
urban areas
quickly come back if they come back at
all
let's see um
they're uh i was tweeting about 5g
and you know people think there might be
some health dangers
from 5g which is the new faster
technology for phones
now the first thing i want to say about
it is as i said my tweet i don't think
society understands that this new
faster speed for phones called 5g
because it sounds like 4g and 3g
and you knew what those were right oh 3g
was dated but it was kind of slow
4g is pretty snappy pretty fast
5g is going to be better it'll be a
little faster right
if that's why you're thinking you're
missing the show
5g is not a little bit faster data
5g will change civilization
5g will just change civilization
in a way similar to how smartphones did
because
i don't know about you but i i'm using
my phone for getting all my delivery of
my food
you know because i'm quarantined at the
moment in anticipation of
some surgery upcoming and so if i didn't
have my phone
i could barely do what i do i mean the
smartphones i think you would agree
have transformed civilization but not as
much as 5g and here's why
5g is going to give you a augmented
reality world it won't be long before
that
my glasses are connected to my phone and
my phone has
5g that's pretty much guaranteed
there's no way that won't happen because
it's just too
it's too there i mean it's too obvious
that that's going to be a thing
once you have enough people who have the
the types of glasses or they don't
really need them they could just hold up
their phone
and see and see an augmented reality
through the you know just like a camera
but those people will be living in a
much
improved world because with your glasses
on you won't just see the things that
are there
you'll see a menu for everything there
there's a television across the room i
would see a
remote control pop up and i could
control my tv
in the air because in the air i would
see an actual remote control
so i could get directions on anything i
could find out you know
really i would have this whole enhanced
reality such that when i took my glasses
off at night
it would start to feel the way you feel
when you accidentally leave home without
your phone
have you had that experience ever get in
your car and you're driving some place
you're going to be gone for a while and
you look for your phone and it's not
there
and you think oh god what if what if i
get a problem
i want you know it's not the end of the
world but it definitely bothers you
right now imagine if you had an enhanced
reality world
an augmented reality where you're seeing
things floating that don't exist
you can call up a screen that floats in
front of you to watch a
to watch a movie that floats in the air
that only you can see
you know because you got your your your
earbuds into so you're walking around
watching a movie you meet somebody
their their social media profile appears
above their head
try to live without that it will be
so addictive and useful it'll be like
if you didn't have a smartphone so i
think that the world
will start to bifurcate into people who
are essentially
cyborgs because once you get to the
point where you're living in an enhanced
reality with you know labels and
messages and instructions and
more detail and all that you're
basically a cyborg
now uh i've argued for a long time and
elon musk said something similar
recently
that the smartphones already made us
cyborgs
so we're you know the fact that you can
leave it at home and drive away
is sort of trivial because you'll wish
you hadn't
right but as soon as you've got the the
what's it called the neural link uh
which is
also elon musk's one of his companies
they're going to embed a little sensor
for your brains you maybe could control
things
um just by thinking it now imagine if
you
if you could see through your glasses
and enhance reality with augmented stuff
and you can just think them to change so
you could just look around you could see
a tv
and you you could just blink at it and
it would come on
because your your brain knew that you
wanted it to be on
so put those things together and we are
fully into the cyborg cyborg
era but here's the problem what if
everybody doesn't become a cyborg
will there be a human organic
movement of people who don't have any
technology
probably i just don't know how big it
will be will it be you know
amish country small or will be a third
of the country
doesn't want to be a cyborg now if you
ask me
oh i can't wait make me a cyborg
as quickly as you can
but anyway people don't realize what a
big deal that is but here's the funny
part of my story
there's nothing more amusing well there
probably is but it's amusing
when you're on social media and people
don't know what your background is
and they challenge you on a point that
you might be
the one person in the world who knows
more about it than anybody
so it's sort of like that woody allen
movie i think it was annie hall where
he's standing in line
for a show and they're arguing about
some public figure
marshall mcluhan an author and marsha
mcluhan
ends up in this movie scene the actual
marshall mcluhan
is standing in line right behind him and
gets into the conversation and
and corrects something and that that
movie scene always stuck with me
because you see that playing out in real
life and it happened
here so somebody said to me on social
media
that 5g hasn't been tested because the
the big companies that are going to roll
it out they would have no interest
in testing it to find out that it's
dangerous
and therefore it's not been tested sort
of logically you say to yourself
well logically they don't want to hear
that it's bad for you they want to make
a trillion dollars
the phone companies mostly so you know
and the phone makers
so nobody would have studied it
now that's what somebody said to me on
social media and here was my answer
i used to work for the phone company and
part of my job
was was doing the economic projections
of whether we should do more wireless
stuff
i actually personally worked on that and
part of my
economic decision was informed with by
my co-worker
who i often sat right next to whose job
it was
to study all the the health studies
of the cell cell phones so that was the
um prior to 5g technology that was
probably a 3g kind of a technology
and we studied it because that's part of
the economics
i wasn't going to give management an
economic analysis that says
looks like we'll make a billion dollars
on this and ignore the fact that it
might kill people
i'm not going to leave that out that's
pretty important
to the economics of a project if you
leave out the part where it kills 100
million people
i don't think you've done your work
right so
this person was arguing me with me that
a phone company
would ignore this part of the economic
impact you know the health part which
also has an economic impact
and she was talking to somebody who
literally was the guy who did it
i actually worked at a phone company i
actually did those economics
and i sat next to the guy who did look
in detail
at the health studies and then
summarized them for management so
management was comfortable
that it wouldn't be killing people now
years have passed
has anybody died from their cell phone
you know can we say that
my economic analysis was accurate that i
didn't need to include it
can we say that my co-worker who studied
it got it right
now if you're telling me that apple
apple i mean think about this you're
telling me that apple
is going to bet a trillion dollars
because it'll be something like that
you know eventually you tell me apple is
going to bet a trillion dollars on the
business plan
without looking at the most obvious
biggest thing that you should look at
i think they looked at it now you can
make the argument
that whoever's looked at it has looked
at the wrong stuff
you could make the argument that the
studies weren't good enough
there are lots of things you could argue
that i wouldn't argue back there are
plenty of bad studies
but here's what i will not allow anybody
to tell me
and without pushing back don't tell me
they haven't looked into it
are you kidding don't tell me that they
haven't looked into it
and if any of those things were credible
from the brain cancer to
gives you coronavirus or makes it worse
to
stunt your growth if any of that was
backed by science
companies like apple are not going to
wade into it with that
that kind of a risk that's a that is a
company destroying risk
you just don't take that risk it's just
not a thing
but that's different from saying let me
be very clear
i'm not a doctor i don't know what
causes risk and what doesn't
but i'm telling you they looked into it
that's all i'm going to tell you
there's some evidence based on we don't
have much information on it yet
it comes from a tweet from somebody who
seems to know a lot of stuff
that the houston consulate that was
closed the chinese consulate that
had evidence apparently of spying on
american companies and intellectual
property theft and all that
apparently there's some information we
haven't seen yet
that would suggest that china is backing
black lives matter
now i ask you does that sound likely
does it seem likely or unlikely to you
that china
might have at least tried i don't know
how successful they were but at least
tried
to encourage black lives matter to do a
little more protesting
because here's the calculation you
should look at
when trying to decide if that's true
number one
would they think of it of course of
course so you don't have to wonder
hey did china have that idea had they
considered it
did anybody suggest hey maybe you should
back the
protesters who are you know making the
united states look bad
of course they thought of it because if
this situation
were reversed we would have thought of
it i mean i'm sure we've backed
dissidents and protesters in other
countries that's pretty basic
the second thing you should ask for is
what would be the penalty
for getting caught and we already know
the penalty for getting caught
it's nothing that's nothing this
consular closed
but they have other consulates the the
the penalty is basically nothing one
consulate got closed
like it's not as if they don't have
computers and hackers and thieves
and other consulates i don't know how
how much difference does it make if you
live in
in houston versus you got a consulate
somewhere else
so i don't think there is any risk you
know it just
costs a little money right they've got
to remove move a consulate
but it's not like anybody died it's not
like we
completely decoupled over this it didn't
tell us anything we didn't already know
no risk so if there's no risk but
there's a potential big reward
and there could be if they're
destabilizing the united states
of course it's happening in the in the
situation where
they think of it there are lots of
people involved you know
in china there's lots of people involved
and
there's a big payoff and a small risk
it'll happen every time every time it's
going to happen
i mean mischief will happen under those
conditions
so cnn continues to be
funny in trying to be serious so caitlyn
caitlin collins who's one of their local
anti-trump
voices she was mocking him in a written
article i think there was a
from a video piece because he decided to
cancel the republican national
convention
which of course she would agree with
because cnn is sort of
anti-large gatherings unless they're
protests
and then she says that he would cancel
his convention
despite pushing for schools to reopen
now the
the implication is that that would be
inconsistent
why would the president
not think it was safe to have a
convention if he does think it's safe to
send kids to school
is that a fair comparison you know i
complain all the time that people
who um come up through a journalism
or you know some specific
profession if they don't have a broad
understanding of how to make decisions
and how to compare
things the way an economist or an
engineer or scientist would
that they say consistently dumb things
but don't know it
and i don't think anything could be
dumber than saying
i don't understand the consistency if
the president thinks that a bunch of
older adults packed into a room
is dangerous why doesn't he think that
the group who basically doesn't get
coronavirus why wouldn't he think
they're dangerous
they couldn't be more different
situations they couldn't be more
different
now is it true that opening schools will
also cause
spread of the coronavirus yes yes
everybody knows that
the president knows that nobody's
denying it
it's just that we think that's a level
that's controllable
if you're you know comparing it to the
presumed
benefits of getting kids back to school
that there is a risk
but it's one that the president decides
is worth it
i don't know how cnn can pretend
that they can't see the difference there
and they're they're looking for these
little
gachas um
five seattle uh news organizations were
ordered by a judge
to turn over their video and photos for
protests
so law enforcement wanted to get a hold
of all the video and pictures of
protests so they could find out
who to arrest etc news organizations
resisted and now the king county
superior court said
that they have to give it up interesting
so all of the news organizations
just became weaponized by the police
will that change i don't know so
uh can the news organizations continue
to send
news crews who will take pictures and
video knowing that those pictures and
video will go directly to the police
and then they will be the news
organizations will be part of what's
disbanding black lives matter very
ticklish position to be in wouldn't you
say
i saw somebody asking me about uh
what's his name portnoy and barstool
barstool sports he did an interview with
president trump people are saying and i
would agree with him
i like to use that trump phrase people
are saying
that that that's the best interview with
the president that they've ever seen
and i would say i would agree okay in
in terms of entertainment and in terms
of
humanizing the president and just having
fun with it
probably the best one i i would say i
would say it's the
best interview with the president i've
seen now the president was very good at
avoiding uh and avoiding the questions
so it was this weird situation yeah dave
portney
dave portnoy it was this weird situation
where dave would ask a question such as
you know do you always use the power
handshake
with world leaders wouldn't you like to
know the answer to that question
it was like he asked the question that
i've thought about for so long
and nobody's ever asked it now of course
the president completely ignored the
question
and just talked about handshakes and
coronavirus and
how world leaders love him and stuff
which was
perfectly executed media
spin if you will in other words the
president is just really good
at turning the question into whatever he
wanted the question to be
which is what you actually learn when
you take media training you learn how to
do that
it's something the president does great
and most politicians do it
doing well as well um
the only thing that bothered me about
dave
portnoy's interview is that it should
have been me
and when i say a show to bed b it just
means i'm jealous
yeah so i'm just jealous because if
there was anybody who would give an
irreverent uh interview with the
president they would still be watchable
i would be on that list of people that
you should watch interview the president
now i do have her uh informally i did
put a request
in but i probably need to formalize that
because i think that between now and
november
an interview with me with president
trump i think would be useful
for the country uh i wouldn't be just
entertaining
i'd want it to be useful so i think i
could
frame things in a way that you would
quite enjoy it
but yes i i'll have to confess there are
very few things that make me jealous
because it's just not a it's just not an
emotion i spend any time with
but and that's why this caught me off
guard and it's why it's
it's why i'm mentioning it that was the
first time
like i genuinely felt jealous i mean
it's a small thing right it has no real
impact in my life
but he was that good so you want to be
so good at your job
as dave portnoy is you want to be so
good that somebody else who does that
job goes
oh damn it damn it that should have
been me so
a plus watch it if you haven't seen it
i cheekily am continuing to say that um
oh by the way i just one more thing
about the find people hoax
in the past when i've tweeted that the
find people hoax is a hoax my
comment feed would just fill with people
who would say no it isn't
it's totally true i heard it myself
today i
i tweeted that and got almost
no people who thought it was true now i
don't know if that's because
all of the democrats now know it wasn't
true
or if they gave up
you just suddenly they stopped refuting
that point that doesn't make sense
i feel like maybe we made a dent
collectively
because at least my critics have backed
off and just
you know let it go that i'm stating it
as a fact that it's a hoax and then
they're letting it go now which
i think is capitulation but i might be a
little
optimistic on that at least for the
commenters not for the
i think biden still says it all right my
last point here
i've said this before but you cannot um
i don't think you could ignore the
effect of fiction has
on how we look at the real world because
everything you look at needs to fit some
model of
understanding so and ideally you want
the new information to fit some
existing model in your head and you just
populate that existing model that's
called
confirmation bias and
you see it in everything right you see
the left agrees to the left the right
agrees to the right
but there's there's a statement about
human beings that i think you would all
agree
with which is it's difficult to do
something
anything until you can first imagine it
so you don't really attempt to do things
you can't imagine
can work the wright brothers um
invented an airplane because they could
well imagine
you know they could see it flying you
know i assume
i assume that they imagined it working
and then
then they worked on anywhere now all the
things you imagine don't work
necessarily when you try to do them but
you're not going to do anything
until you can first imagine it's a thing
and that makes me
get to my impression or the filter that
i just sort of automatically have
on watching the protests the first
filter is
it looks very female lead and
i don't know how many of you are also
getting that feeling
but antifa in particular and i think
black lives matter as well
but they seem like they are mostly
female leaders
or at least the leaders that are the
most vocal or maybe the most effective
most aggressive seem to be female
so it's like a female lead organization
and the males
at least the antifa males not so much
the black lives matter males
but the antifa males seem to fall into a
category of
not as manly if we could say that and
again this isn't an insult
you know i'm not saying that if you're
if you don't have a manly persona
you're worth less or anything nothing
like that
i'm left to burning so if you want to be
every letter in lgbtq i'm cool with that
i'm 100 cool with that you can be any
letter you want
you can be any lifestyle you want if it
doesn't bother me
you can be whatever you want so there's
no criticism
implied here i'm just observing that
there's a certain
kind of man who is enjoying this
anti-foss situation
and they you know if i could use the
diminutive term
beta males they kind of fall into that
category
now again this is not an insult
because i think that it's a big world
i'm not saying it's
a good thing to be an alpha male or that
it's a bad thing to be a beta male
they both exist it's a preference it's
the way you're born
or it's a lifestyle it doesn't matter
it's all okay with me
alright if you're not breaking the law
if you're not violating the constitution
it's just none of my business period
could not care less
about your personal lifestyle choices if
they don't affect me
so i say that just because my filter is
that it looks like the
it looks like game of thrones with uh
daenerys
so you got the strong female leader the
queen of dragons
and she formed an army of of literally
eunuchs
so their their men had been cast
castrated
to make them more you know docile and
obedient soldiers i guess
i don't know what the theory was there
exactly but i don't know why you'd want
castrated soldiers it feels like the
wrong idea
but it reminded me of that
and it looks like it's the queen of
dragons that are unique army but they're
reenacting the joker movie
and i said this before to great pushback
which i enjoy of course and the pushback
was that if the joker movie had not been
such a universally
you know acclaimed movie and a lot of
people saw it
if you hadn't first pictured the joke or
movie
would it have been as easy to recreate
it
because that's what the protests and the
looting effectively did it recreated the
look and feel
of the joker movie is that a coincidence
is it simply that there are movies and
they're in my head
and so i just interpret the world
through those movies and that's all it
is
or is there a causal
relationship in other words if you can
only do the things you can imagine
and what you could imagine was not you
know
everybody's doing well but what you
could imagine was that joker movie
you're more likely to do the thing you
could imagine
so i do think that fiction has a big
role in how we're interpreting our
reality but also
how we act on it because you just don't
act on things you can't imagine
all right um
i'm just looking at your comments
yeah you know um i don't think that
i don't think we should make a judgment
about what's better or worse
when it comes to people's biological
situation
but it is fair to say it's different you
know nobody would argue with the fact
that you know there are differences
among people
but we don't have to put a value
judgment on that
anyone see zuckerberg's face in hawaii
yeah
yeah zuckerberg uses a lot of
a lot of sunscreen but i don't
if you've seen his complexion you know
there's a good reason for that
but where is the imagining from well
it's coming from fiction
that's the point somebody says you're
reaching on the joker thing
in my opinion well you know the the best
opinions are the ones that
you say to yourself in fact i i try to
stay in the space as much as possible
my favorite opinions to present here are
the ones where you say to yourself
i'm not so sure that's true
i've got a little skepticism about that
those are my favorite places to be i
will tell you that based on everything i
know from hypnosis from persuasion
and living a life in which i've done
everything from marketing to selling
that the
the models that you have in your head of
what the world can look like
are very persuasive now if you have less
experience
in hypnosis and persuasion than i do
and your opinion is different from mine
about this topic
you should ask yourself would your
opinion change
if you knew as much as i did about this
specific topic
and that's where i want you to be i want
you to be thinking
maybe maybe i should look into that
maybe that's a thing or maybe i'll look
for it in the future
look forward in the future and you might
be surprised but you don't have to
believe everything i say
i wouldn't talk to you later
