hey good morning
and welcome to
sorry
the highlight of civilization
and if you think it can't get any better
than this
well that would be a reasonable thing to
think because i mean look how good it is
already but believe it or not
believe it or not it can go up another
level and all you need is a copper
mugler glass a tanker chelsea stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's a
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes you tingle with anticipation it's
going to make your whole day better you
just watch go
oh yeah
oh yeah
well um
i was just thinking of this before i
came on
and so i'm just going to throw this in
here
have you ever heard of the
is it the five or four languages of love
which is it is it four or five i can't
remember it was a big book was it gary
chapman maybe
the language is the love and the idea
was
that everybody has a preferred way is
five
there everybody has a preferred way
to be loved
so for example some people like words of
affirmations you say good things about
them
some people like uh acts of service you
do something for them that's kind or
nice
others like touch
touch what are the other ones
so i'm forgetting too
so we've got uh touch x of kindness
uh time spent time spent
bj's that's it no no that wasn't one of
them
it was a very good guess bj's but no
quality time
all right excess service all the time
gifts that's one of those gifts
so gifts acts of service
time spent
touch
that's the idea
now that sounds like a pretty good
framework doesn't it
wouldn't you love
wouldn't you love
to be able to break people down that
easily it's like oh
it looks like um looks like i'm dating
one of these one of these it's like ah
give them some stuff
but let me tell you
what a scam this is
biggest scam in the world
ah thank you eric
i appreciate that
um
here's why it's a scam
what do men say when you say what's your
language of love
anybody what do men say
touch
it's just dutch
basically if you're willing to touch a
man
then we feel oh you must like me if
you're willing to touch me
but pretty much nothing else works
pretty much nothing else
right
now imagine if you got food without the
touch though you're saying oh food works
but suppose you only got food
that wouldn't work
would it it's just touch
now what do women say when you say what
is your language of love
what do they say
what do women say have you ever asked a
woman
somebody says everything
acts of service and gifts
acts of service and gifts
usually they'll have one or two it'll be
one of those or the other one
now
do you see the scam yet
it's a total scam
because if you ask somebody what the
language of love is
let me write if you don't see how big of
a scandal says if you ask a woman what
her language of love is
why would she say touch
when that's the part she gets all the
time
too much of it
no woman is going to answer the question
touch
it's not on the option set because if
they answer touch all they get is what
they already had
yeah your husband wants to touch you
your boyfriend wants to touch you
if they answer
uh
gifts
then they get all of the touch
and gifts
right what if they say
um
you know my language of love is acts of
service
well then they get their husband to do
more of the housework
and they still get the same amount of
touch
the whole thing is a con
it's a total con and i actually fell for
it for years for years i thought you
know that that's amazing how well that
breaks that down but then you actually
start trying it out
and every time that i every time i asked
anybody female
what their language of love was i was
waiting for touch
like well she says touch
it's go time just stay touch say touch
acts of service
but also gifts
yeah what about touch
no not really no not really it doesn't
mean much speak to me because you got it
for free
of course you don't mention that one
all right now suppose i'm going to show
you a the stand-up comedians method
you've seen this before right it's so
uh
it's so
you know standard that i hate to do it
but it'll teach you that it's a standard
thing
you say what if somebody else acted that
way so now that you've established how
women quite logically act they're not
going to ask for something they already
have
they can ask for something they don't
have duh
so then you do the trick where you say
well what if men acted like that
imagine your wife comes up to you and
you say
honey
what is your language of love and and
you say you know
i'm glad you asked that i'm glad we're
communicating my language love is acts
of service
acts of service
what
yeah acts of service because i don't
feel you're doing enough
work
uh you could call them chores
or maybe uh
tasks
but i don't think you're doing enough
projects for my benefit
and if you did
oh my god i'd love you
for example you see that fence over
there
badly indeed a painting
and you know how much i complained about
it
if i came home one day and i saw you
like in your overalls and you were
painting that fence for me
honey
i would love you so hard
i would love you so hard
i like the touching too but really i
like
i like when i come home and i see stuff
got done
that would make me love you so hard
now how'd that go over ladies
so when i told you my language of love
ladies anybody
did you say to yourself when you were
listening to me
there's a guy i want
there's a guy who's not afraid to make
me do some work
yeah
he he knows that i put the dishes in the
dishwasher but he's saying he'd love me
more if i also took them out and put
them away
like before we were sharing that
but i feel like i need to step up and
show my love
by doing a little extra work
so to everybody who tried to scam me
with the language of love
khan you
i caught on
i finally caught on no i'm not going to
give you gifts i'm not going to
be your goddamn butler
please
if you want to be with me touch me or
get the away from me
i'm not your butler
i'm not your
amazon.com you work that stuff out
yourself
all right and don't con me with your
stupid book about how i'm
supposed to act because it's just a con
can we move on
uh aoc had a video
in which she said uh
she's sort of modeling for her
constituents acts of resistance because
as you know we live in a time in which
um
you really have to push back against the
evil forces that are
that are
you know forming against us and so aoc
has shown how she models her resistance
and specifically
as a woman
now i do assume she identifies as a
woman i've not checked that so
if i'm assuming too much i apologize
but i believe that was the context
uh and so her act of resistance in this
world where
you know bodily autonomy is is being
challenged for women especially
she showed on her video that she was
going to get her nails done
and the context was when she was young
she was a religious household
and it was frowned on
to get your nails done
and so as a an active defiance now as a
member of congress
she's going to show you that she can get
her nails done
anytime she wants
just because she wants
now that's the kind of leadership that i
think this country needs
right
nothing nothing about
you know russia or trade deals or things
like that but this is sort of the small
public act of defiance that i think
every woman should get behind
in fact i think you should do less of
everything else you're doing and more of
this
because it's a twofer
not only do you look more lovely
if you do it right you know get your
nails done
maybe have a hair appointment possibly
by a new outfit
that is the type of resistance that i
support
and
i would even go so far as to say that's
my language of love
so
i did fall in love with aoc when she
said she was getting her nails done
because
as she's making herself more attractive
to my lustful intentions i think that is
exactly the kind of wooing that i want
i believe she's trying to seduce me
i mean it looks like she's talking to
the public but i feel like it's really
to me
does anybody else get that feeling it's
just to me yeah it's heroic that's the
word i've been searching for
thank you alpha
um that was exactly the right word she's
not just
telling us what to do
she's modeling it
she's modeling it
and
she didn't make a big deal about this
but it looked like she was on foot
walking to get her nails done
and
if you've seen how worn out her shoes
are
you know that
she's taken some sacrifice for this
resistance
well let's talk about
january 6 hearings and the three things
that they've taught us
regarding the miracle of mind reading
the miracle of mind reading so here's
what we've learned from the january 6
committee number one
trump's inner thoughts about the
validity of the vote count
are things you can know
you can actually know what his inner
thoughts are
interesting now before the january 6
committee i actually thought
there wasn't any way to do that
i thought okay you know brain scan you
know you're just guessing but no it
turns out you can actually know what
somebody was thinking
um
so we know his inner thoughts about the
validity of vocal but we also know his
inner thoughts
about just how the protests would unfold
and exactly what he was thinking
about the dangers to the various people
and the risk-reward
it's not stated anywhere
but
this is what we've learned that we can
know that anyway
the the private inner thoughts of what
he was thinking
and
um
importantly and this is also highly
related
we can tell what trump really meant
even when his words are the opposite
of of that
so for let me give you an example that
doesn't sound
reasonable right that you can tell what
he really meant on the inside
by looking at his words which actually
say the opposite
of what we now know is on the inside of
his head because of psychic abilities so
for example when he was talking to was
it refs rafzenberger or whatever the
secretary of state of georgia and on the
phone call he allegedly said
all we need to do is you know find
x number of votes
fined now
if you're using
find in the normal way
let's say you were a
automobile manufacturer
let's say your tesla
and you you've run out of cars because
you've already sold all you have
what would you do if you ran out of cars
and you needed more cars
would you find them
would you find the cars
or would you manufacture them because
they don't exist in the first place
which would you do
well according to democrats
you don't want to go the hard way which
is manufacture them
because that's going to cost something
right you got to buy materials there's
time and labor put it all together make
sure it works quality control that's a
lot of work but the alternative which
we've learned
is that you can just
find things
so when things don't
the the two words that mean the same
thing according to democrats and i
didn't know this until now but
manufacturing something that doesn't
exist
and
finding something
those actually mean the same thing
now you would say it's opposite
probably before i explained it to you
right you would say well that's the
opposite
finding it means it already exists
manufacturing it means it doesn't exist
are those not opposites
finding something that exists
versus creating something that doesn't
exist kind of opposites aren't they
but that's what we learned is that when
trump says
we only need to find the votes which
some people mistakenly thought was a
reference to
some irregularities
and if there was an audit
they might discover
that the vote count was different than
they originally thought and that would
be sort of a standard way old days how
they used the word
find f-i-n-d that's what it meant but
now it doesn't mean that now it means
the same as manufacturer
so when elon musk needs more cars to
sell
he no longer needs his manufacturing
plants
completely waste of money he could have
done what trump suggests and just find
the cars just find them it's just
cheaper you know it's common sense why
would you build something when you can
just find it and it's exactly the same
thing according to democrats
all right um
i i've got to keep on this point
and i'm trying i'm a b testing a bunch
of messaging so you're going to see the
same story
through a bunch of filters
and then you tell me which one works
okay here's here's the next take on the
same thing
i call this what are the odds
and it's from the tweet today i said the
most shameless yet effective
part of the january 6 gasoline operation
is that it depends on convincing the
public
trump privately believed he lost the
election
now i'm no mind reader
i'm no mind reader
but let's
let's just think about what are the odds
that trump
didn't literally believe that he won and
something was wrong
what are
the odds
and if i were asked to testify i won't
be
or ever uh interviewed on cnn i won't be
and they said well you know
we believe that trump knew that he lost
the election and therefore that's why
it's a it's a insurrection and not a
request for an audit
if he didn't know he if he didn't know
then he was just requesting an audit so
he did know
right
that would be a completely different
situation
so the entire january 6th thing
depends on one fact
what he knew
am i wrong
if you change your assumption of what
trump knew
it's all different
and and let me ask you what would be the
more reasonable assumption of why he
knew
think of trump's personality
think of the fact that it looked in
every way his rally
his rally size
you know the enthusiasm and then the
vote count was going his way until about
bedtime given all those facts
do you think that trump
privately in his own mind the unspoken
thoughts do you think he actually
thought he lost
or let me put it in other words
what are the odds that he really
believed he lost
and this is where you use the really
thing
really
imagine sitting next to a democrat and
they say well he knew he lost you just
look at him there's nobody else around
and just say
really
have you been watching this president
for even one second
do you know anything about him like even
even the first thing that everybody
knows about trump do you know anything
about him
because if he did
the last thing you would think
is that he believed he lost
now this is independent from you know
whether the vote was rigged or not i'm
not even talking about that
i'm just saying what he believed
there isn't really any chance
not reasonably that he really believed
he lost
right
does anybody believe that
and could you get a democrat to actually
look you look you in the face
and not and not joke and actually make
direct contact and say to you
see if you can do this this actually be
a good test see if you get somebody to
look you in the face
and tell you seriously
i believe
that legitimately
trump knew not suspected to suspect
suspected isn't enough
we're not going for suspected
new
get somebody to look you in the eye
and tell you really yeah i believe trump
knew he lost because that would be
compatible with his personality would it
really
really
believing he lost would be compatible
with his personality really
no
not when there's ambiguity about you
know the outcome
now you know you could argue at this
point
no
no
shenanigans have been
proven by any court and i agree with
that
so i've always accepted the election
from the day it was called you know
until something changes my mind and i
don't have that in front of me
lots of lots of sketchy looking things
but nothing that would change my mind
yet
but
there's no way in hell
he believed he lost that election i'm
not a mind reader
but remember in order to be guilty of
something you've got to be sure
you can't be guessing
and even if you say well scott you're
just guessing what he thought too
exactly
exactly
i'm just guessing what he thought
now it's a good guess
but you don't put people in jail because
you guessed what they thought
do you
and the democrats are literally talking
about putting trump in jail
based on
guessing
what he thought
that's really happening
you don't think
republicans are being hunted
in public right in front of you with
nothing being hidden it's right in front
of you you can look at all of it
yourself there's nothing i say that you
can't just observe directly
they have shown no evidence of a crime
uh lawrence tribe just said he believes
that uh
uh merrick garland will indict trump he
says he believes he will indict him
based on what has already been
shown in the january 6 hearings
and
cnn also reported
that you know there are people who think
he'll get indicted do you know what's
missing
what's missing from that story
for what
for what
i haven't even heard a crime be alleged
have you
i have not even heard a crime
alleged
the this the gaslighting operation is so
extensive
that they've caused reasonable people to
say they think he'll be indicted
when no crime
has even been alleged
he will be indicted for the crime of
which nobody has a name for a
description of
or any evidence for
that's happening right in front of you
it's the most amazing br
gaslighting operation of all time now of
course you know it depends on having one
side show the information on the other
side not responding which is what we
have
so i'll tell you i tweeted this
well the first thing i ask is why don't
we have any professional psychics at the
hearings
because if the entire the and i think
you would agree with this the entire
case depends on what trump was thinking
right have i established that as an
assumption you'd agree with yet
the entire case
depends what he was thinking
because my assumption again i can't
prove what he was thinking but it's so
it's an assumption
my assumption
based on what i would have been thinking
if i'd been in that situation is that
the protesters on large not every single
one
and that trump and his people on large
may have been some exceptions but
generally speaking they thought that
they were trying to fix an election that
was broken
and if he believed it was really a
broken election
his intentions matter to everything
he was either trying to fix something
that was broken and the country would
want fixed
or he was trying to overthrow the
country
and the only way you know which one it
was
because the facts and evidence would
support both hypotheses completely
the facts and evidence
completely support those two hypotheses
one that he thought it was wrong
and he was trying to fix it for the good
of everybody and the other is that he
didn't believe it was is true but he was
going to try to take over the country
anyway
so if the entire case depends on knowing
what he was thinking
and
democrats are very big on trust the
experts
why have no professional psychics been
invited to testify
because in this case they would be the
experts
am i wrong
now you have to believe that mind
reading is actually real
which it isn't
but if you believed it was real and
that's been demonstrated to be true
so we know that the democrats believe
mind reading is real based on how they
act right so all of their actions are
consistent with that again i'm not mind
reading but all of their actions are
consistent with they believe they can
see his inner thoughts
well if you believe that that's a thing
if you believe people can know people's
inner thoughts why would you why would
you depend on amateurs
you should actually have the psychics
and if i were a republican and trying to
you know
make a scene i would actually have an
event in which i
invited psychics to read trump's mind
during january 6
because it's the only thing that matters
and here's the devastating kill shot
here's the kill shot for january 16th
make them admit only one thing matters
what trump was thinking
that's it
all that matters is what he was thinking
make them admit that everything depends
on that
that's it
as soon as they admit it all depends on
what he was thinking
then you have to say all right let's get
serious about determining what he was
thinking
we have some uh testimony from people
who are
familiar with this thinking
is that a thing
have you ever had people who are
familiar with your thinking get your
thinking wrong you know who would be
really familiar with your thinking in
your life
your spouse
right i mean who would be more familiar
with your thinking than your spouse
and your spouse never is wrong about
what you're thinking right
i mean really
really the people who know you best
don't have a idea what you're
thinking
almost never
the people closest to you don't know
what you're thinking so what i hear
about some advisor
familiar with the president's thinking
that is so gas lady
the fact that you would even entertain
that as like a real thing
you should be embarrassed if you do
you should be embarrassed
all right
so here's also what is missing and if i
were republicans i would have this event
too i would invite astrologers
to tell us what trump was probably
thinking on january 6.
now
like trump i'm a gemini
and i would put myself forward as an
expert
because a gemini knows what a gemini is
thinking
am i right astrology tells us that's
true and that's science that is science
people
the science of astrology so i think they
should bring in
more psychics bring in more astrologists
because if you're not even trying to get
expert testimony on what trump was
thinking you're just guessing
you're just guessing and why would you
guess when you have experts
in the very field that it matters most
which is mind reading
get your expert mind readers please put
them on the list
and astrologers
andrew andrew sullivan had a uh
interesting article today in which he
basically says it's now obvious that
trump knew of the plans knew about the
weapons there
uh and the risk of the weapons
and was totally behind the
the move on the capitol
that's what
andrew sullivan got and at the hearings
so far
did anybody watch the same hearings he
watched
did you see any of that
now what's interesting about it is that
andrew sullivan is smart
and and he has a history of being able
to see both sides of the political aisle
but
um
i've seen a lot of the hearings and
clips and stuff i didn't see anything
like this nor have i seen any reporting
on it but he tells us like it's a fact
that it's now obvious that trump knew of
the plans
what plans exactly did he know of
did he know that they were going to
physically threaten pence
or and did and did if he knew that
did he think that was actually a real
risk or do you think oh secret service
has this that's not a real risk
because remember the president gets
threatened to be killed basically every
day
what does the president do when he gets
a death threat
nothing
because he gets one every day
if you're the president what do you
think of death threats
he's gone through four years of death
threats himself trump
and and he had not been killed yet do
you know why
he had secret service protection and and
he thinks they're pretty good at it
now pence had secret service protection
so did trump necessarily believe that he
was in danger
when death threats to a president or a
vice president probably are so routine
and the secret service is so qualified
probably they were fine
now we we all you know mourn the tragedy
of ashley babbitt being shot that day
but the fact is the secret service who
or wherever was guarding trump
they were pretty strapped weren't they i
mean i'm pretty sure they were armed
and i'm pretty sure they could have just
started blazing if things got touched
and it would have been you know tragedy
on top of tragedy on top of tragedy
but i'm pretty sure they could have
protected pence
am i wrong
do you think the crowd could have
actually gotten to pence let's say they
they breached the final door
wherever pence was
there would be so many bullets flying
through that door
the crowd would just be mowed down
and and i don't think the crowd had
enough firepower that they would have
responded anyway except you know medical
emergency
so now if you were trump
did you actually think pence was in
danger
probably not
because i'm not sure i would have
processed it at the time
as a real danger because it's so it's
such a background danger that a
president deals with every day well got
another bomb threat at the white house
should we evacuate
nah
didn't look serious
don't you think that happens literally
every day don't you think the white
house gets some kind of terrorist threat
to the white house
basically every day
and they don't you know evacuate every
day so i've got a feeling that you get
used to that kind of thing when you're
president and probably didn't process it
as an actual threat now again
am i reading trump's mind no i couldn't
possibly know what he was thinking i'm
just giving you some context and saying
what would you think if you were in that
situation
who knows
but you also don't know what trump is
thinking
well we've learned that
cnn has learned to prove a negative
um and here's an example daniel dale
their fact checker
wrote this
he said a leading republican candidate
for governor of arizona kerry lake
continues to put lies about the 2020
presidential election at the center of
her campaign
this week calling it quote disqualifying
and sickening for a rival candidate not
to say that the election was stolen and
then comma and this is daniel dale's
statement
though it wasn't stolen
though it wasn't stolen
now he's the fact-check guy
so you should take that as a fact
how is the fact demonstrated how is it
proved
how do you prove something what didn't
happen
you can't
but they did
so until i read this i thought well
if you haven't checked
everything that can be checked you
haven't looked at the technology the
database you you haven't looked at any
logs about data going across
how would you know it wasn't stolen
now let me be clear
i'm not saying it was stolen i have no
evidence of that
but you know what i also don't have
evidence of
that it wasn't stolen
there are two things that are unknown
was it stolen i don't know
was it not stolen i don't know
nobody knows
those are two things that are unknowable
that cnn is now
one of them has been presented to you as
a fact and unknowable
has been presented as a fact
let me say it again
right in front of you
the gas lighting is so extreme
that right in front of you right where
you can see it nothing's being hidden
they're telling you that a thing that
you know is unknowable
has been proven
and they and they can write that right
on their page
with no shame
that's that's how extensive the
gaslighting is the the people will
accept
that the thing they know can't be known
they all know it can't be known don't
they well that would be mind reading but
one assumes one assumes
that most people know you
if you haven't ordered it at all you
can't know
right
but no
here's a my favorite auto accident story
there was a truck semi truck accident in
utah
that released uh some bees
so some bees were in the back of the
truck and they got released
and that didn't sound too bad
a bunch of bees got released you think
well
you know they weren't african killer
bees i mean how bad could it be
there were 10 million bees
in the truck
10 million bees
were released in the same place at the
same time
10 million bees
now
i don't know how fast i can run
but i feel like i would have discovered
it had i been anywhere near that truck
i think you would have seen this like
dark cloud of like
of you know
bees darkening the sky
and i'd be there
now i'm going to see how fast i can run
before it was just playing around
but right now you're going to see
literally how fast i can run
b's in a truck 10 million
all right
um
interestingly cnn when it gave a rundown
of what we've learned so far about
january 6. here's one of the things that
cnn
pointed out with a full paragraph
that i think we have to give them credit
for because you know we're looking for
their move toward the middle to see if
that's real or if that's a fake out
but one of the uh
titled paragraphs of many title
paragraphs here is that the hearings are
only showing you one side of the story
and they go on to show that the two
republicans you know are not exactly
republican republicans
that's pretty good
actually i was surprised are you
surprised
because calling out to their audience
that it's one-sided
even though it's obviously one-sided
i don't know that their audience was
sophisticated enough to notice because
if you're just dipping in and out
you don't notice what's missing you just
notice what you saw
so for them to call it out and say you
know you shouldn't you should keep in
mind
that you're only seeing one side of the
story they're basically telling you
that you should expect it to be a biased
presentation
how about that
can can we give them credit for that
now i think you know elsewhere in their
reporting they they kind of
um let's say they walk on this point a
little bit because you should sort of
mention this point in every element of
the story
but you only heard one side
every part of the story should be the
same
here's what um we think has been shown
but you're not hearing the other side
but i'll take it
i'll give dan give him some credit for
it
here's what else they said though so we
can take away their credit this is cnn's
reporting
that vote tried
trump's effort to influence vote
counting was widespread his effort to
influence vote crowning
is that what happened
is that a straight reporting
or is that mind reading
because we know what he did we know of
phone calls he made we know what the
words he said
but do we know his intention
because if his intention was to quote
influence the vote count
do you mean influence it as in rig it
because that's not an evidence
or was he trying to influence it toward
more accuracy
because what i see
at least the overt you know the the
words that are actually in in evidence i
see him trying to influence the vote
counting not the vote but the counting
of the vote
toward accuracy
now who else was trying to do that
who else involved in the story
you know from the state level to the
congress
to
everybody literally everybody what was
every single person in the story from
trump
to uh you know adam schiff to everybody
what were they all trying to do
they were trying to influ influence the
vote counting
were they not
wasn't every person
in the story who was involved in any way
trying to influence the vote counting
and they were trying specifically to
influence it toward making it more
reliable
am i wrong
now maybe hypothetically there was
somebody behind the scenes trying to do
the opposite we don't have that evidence
but
why are we blaming trump for trying to
influence the vote counting
when literally
every person was doing that
including me
do you know what i was doing around
january 6
i was trying really hard to influence
the vote counting
do you know what everybody in congress
was doing
trying pretty hard
to influence the vote counting
do you know what trump was doing
presumably
trying to influence the vote counting
everybody was trying to do it
we were all trying to get it right but
we had different ideas of what that
would look like once it was right
right
but
the the
the massive
balls it takes
to run this kind of a gaslighting
campaign where you use words like trump
was trying to influence the vote
counting when every person was
doing that every person
including me
was trying to influence the vote
counting to make it better
we were saying stuff like
why don't you do a full audit
why don't you pause a little until we
check why don't we see if we can get
into those you know voting machines and
see if those could be audited
everybody who said anything like that
including me
we were all trying to influence the vote
count so why why would trump be indicted
for it
for doing everything that the entire
country was doing at the same time
but he'll get indicted for it right
sure
here's the other thing that
cnn calls out because this is an
important part of that january 6 story
the trump was very angry and
there's some reporting that he may have
thrown some ketchup against a wall
or maybe thrown some dishes now let me
put you in the scene
is there a president who is not famous
for getting angry
name the president who is not
famous for getting like angry enough to
at least throw things and swear and
stuff like that probably jimmy carter
yeah jimmy carter it's probably the only
one but basically reporting that a
president was angry
that's not really telling you anything
that's not hillary clinton yeah i'm sure
obama had some uh some angry words
behind
behind the things so anybody who's
saying that a president who
we can speculate
believed an election had been stolen
from him
how was he supposed to feel
how would you like trump if he was not
angry
about that
who would have voted for him if he
didn't get at least that angry about
stuff
right yeah they're confusing the feature
with feature with a bug
nobody would have voted for a trump
who was not capable of getting that
angry
about that situation
now again he may have mistaken the
situation
don't know
but do you want a president who can't
get at least that angry
about that situation
i wouldn't
i would want to know my president is
just crazy about it
and i'd want to know that he would fight
just as hard for other stuff right i'd
want to know he had some passion
about doing the right thing now you
could argue about whether that was the
right thing but you always you always
want a president with some fight in them
don't you
did you want a wimp for a president
and the same would apply for the
democrats do you want the democrat who
doesn't get mad
weren't were there not stories of bill
clinton getting angry in office
can somebody give me a fact check on
that i feel like i have this vague
memory
of bill clinton
like getting pretty heated behind the
scenes can somebody
confirm that
he would erupt in office right that was
actual reporting
now that's a democrat
now what would be my reaction to that if
i heard that bill clinton got so mad he
threw dishes
what would you say about that would you
say oh he's unstable or would you say
yeah
there's a guy who's he's showing up
like there's a guy who showed up for
work
like you want the guy who throws some
dishes
democrat or republican
so to to put this on the list of things
you should maybe be concerned about
is to
i think take it out of context a little
bit
i think you want people who are at least
that mad now if they'd said he'd punched
a human or kicked a dog
well different story
different story but if he's throwing a
dish
that's just about where i'd want him
that's just about the level of anger
that i think is the productive level
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen
is everything i wanted to say
i believe it's another triumph of the
thing we call coffee with scott adams
another highlight of civilization
keeps getting better
and uh do you all have exciting plans
for the weekend and for the fourth of
july
are you celebrating
did i curse too much today
you got a small audience today
that's because you're all out there
holidaying and you should be
trump has a complicated relationship
with ketchup
all right
let me ask you another question you know
the
the aid
to trump who testified hutchinson is her
name
try to look at hutchinson's face
and then imagine her blonde
who is she
just take a look at her face and then
just imagine her blonde
who is she
she looks like she looks exactly like
amber her doesn't she she looks like a
blonde amber herd
there's something about the face that's
kind of
yeah susan stranded face right it's sort
of suggestive
interestingly
uh do you put ketchup on eggs i don't
eat eggs that way
jordan peterson twitter
did that
did jordan peterson get twitter banned
i'm going to guess it's something about
trans
how did i do
something about trans
pronouns right
bingo
surprise
surprise
you know i
um
here's i'll tell you my view on it
maybe i'm just reiterating this i i feel
like the jordan petersons who are um
i'll just put them in a category which
is unfair i know to put anybody in the
category but let's say the people who
are
publicly fighting against
let's say trans options especially for
children
there's there's a problem with that
and the problem is i just don't think
the trans thing is special
we we act like it's special because
we're talking about it
but i don't know if it is um what i see
is
kids and
with the help of their
adult keepers or not
making horrible decisions all the time
life destroying decisions all the time
and we don't stop them from doing it
like we don't we don't interfere with it
as long as it's legal
like we don't say to them you know
you've decided that you're going to
work hard at figure skating
but just look at you you're never going
to be in the olympics i mean seriously
just look at you
but you're going to make the decision
at uh
seven years old or whatever that that's
going to be your thing and you put all
your attention into ice skating knowing
you're never going to be
in the olympics how is that is that a is
that a good decision
i don't think so
i think that's a really
bad bad decision
but we let people make it because it's
their life not ours right people get to
make mistakes
so i guess that's what it is
okay here's what it is i finally just at
this very moment i just realized what
was bothering me about it because
there's something that wasn't connecting
correct me if i'm wrong but jordan
peterson would also be um
quite famous for saying we shouldn't
live in a nanny state
is that a fair characterization that the
government should not be micromanaging
our
choices in our language and our
decisions is that a fair
characterization because i really hate
to mischaracterize him of all people
like i i feel like he would be the
easiest person to mischaracterize
because he's smarter than me
it's easy to
it's easier to characterize someone
else's opinion if they're less smart
than you are but if somebody's smarter
than you you always have to wonder if
you're missing a are you missing an
angle on this like well he's smarter
than i am so
maybe he's got something so here's the
inconsistency
if one believes the government should
stay on your life
for your private decisions why is that
different
for
parents and their child
now it's the children
who you think are making the decision to
to you know transition and then you
think the parents
um you think you're some of you are
thinking the parents are bad parents
because they're letting little kids make
decisions that kids should not be able
to make
right that would be a common thing but
what about what about the idea of just
letting people live their lives
and make their mistakes
the fact that you think it's a mistake
and by the way
i don't disagree
i don't disagree with that some
percentage of people who make the
transition
will regret it
i think the trans community would agree
with that am i wrong
wouldn't wouldn't that be a universally
agreed statement
maybe you disagree on the percentage
but that's not the point
we all agree
that that's a decision that has
really really big consequences and
there's no way to know for sure that you
got it right
right
now for those of you who are saying
but this is different because this is
this is child abuse
i don't know i think there's a lot of
stuff that could go in that category if
you wanted it to
so
i'm not disagreeing
with what's good for people
i'm only asking you if you're being
consistent
and could you support it so so i'm not
sure you're seeing my opinion here if
you think you're seeing my opinion in
this
then remove that from your thoughts
you're not seeing my opinion come
through what i'm talking about
i'm just making statements that i think
you would all agree with
that it's inconsistent
to say the government should stay out of
your business except for this thing
but you might have a reason for that
exception just make sure you have a
reason for it and just be aware that it
would be an exception
i'm always in favor of exceptions by the
way
i'm not the person who says oh never
make an exception i think you have to
i live in the real world you do make
exceptions
and
and i think there are plenty of things
you could say about the schools
could we all agree that the the school
isn't who should be determining your
your kids gender and
sex
i think we could agree there so but if
you agree that the parents
the parents should be in control
and part of the parent decision making
is listening to the kid and deciding if
that should be important or not what
they say at five years old
but i really sort of think
the government needs to stay out of it
now if you said to me scott i agree with
you the government needs to stay out of
it but how about this
how about putting a lot more resources
into making sure
people wait
or they're at least persuaded
to wait to make sure that they're really
making the right decision i'd say fine
i'd say that would be
fine clitorectomy somebody says would i
would i support
a clitorectomy
excellent question
because that will test my consistency
nicely done nicely done
i'll give you an a plus for that
i would not
i would not be in favor of parents being
able to decide that for their kids
so good example good example
but i don't think
the analogy
is equivalent
see this is a problem with analogies
could we agree that nobody is better off
with a clitorectomy
everybody on the same page there's no
such thing as somebody who said i'm glad
i got that right
so that case
there's not much dispute at least within
our culture right within our culture
there's no dispute
but the trans situation
the the driving force of it
is that sometimes
or even most of the time how would i
know
they're right
right
would you
would you prevent
five people from making a right decision
if it allowed five completely different
people
it could sort of con them into making
the wrong decision
which is better
where is your where is your sense of
freedom um land
if you could take it out of the trans
just take it into a general situation a
general situation
if you knew that a law or set of laws
would allow five people to be way better
off
but you were pretty sure
that five other people would be worse
off because they would be influenced
in the wrong way by the five who got it
right
should that be legal
because you're really talking about
people being influenced
and i don't know how you regulate that
it's not about trans it's about minors
correct that is correct
yes when you're talking about the
five-year-olds
it's barely about
trance
that i'm totally with you that's
primarily a question of children
and then
you know that's the canvas and then the
paint on it is the trans topic yes
control versus brainwashing i don't i
don't like to use those words
uh m ball says you're not very good with
logic scott not very good with logic
well m ball
and
your last name is ball
um
it could could indicate you're nuts
possibly but what would be an example of
that
of which i'm not good at logic
somebody's saying that jordan peterson
is a
psychologist
so his opinion on the trans situation
should hold a little bit more weight
maybe
and i would agree that
i would agree he wouldn't know more
about it
but it really comes down to can you let
people make catastrophic mistakes if you
know it's a mistake
let me give you an example
recently
somebody i know
a young young woman
moved in with her boyfriend and got a
dog
what do you think of that
somebody very young
very young
but yeah legal age but very young
moved in with a boyfriend
and the two of them got a dog together
now you give them advice
do you think they should have been able
to make that decision
in my opinion
that decision largely will ruin their
lives
now am i right i don't
i don't know i've just seen the pattern
before
young woman gets a dog with boyfriend
and moves in together you're just
guaranteed a disaster there right so
should they be allowed to do that
should you be allowed
to do that when you know it's going to
completely destroy your options for
careers
future relationships you know there's
going to be a problem when you break up
because they probably are who gets the
dog
it's going to be a disaster right
now that's just my opinion
am i right
how would i know
how would i know
i just have an opinion so should my
opinion
let's say a lot of you had the same
opinion should our opinion stop that
young woman from getting a dog
knowing it's a terrible terrible idea
absolutely not
no no my opinion and the law should have
nothing to say about that we should be
completely silent
and and the person involved should make
the worst decision in the world and just
figure it out because unfortunately you
can't have any kind of a
system
that says that other people get to
decide what your decisions are because
they're better than you at at making
them
and that's what we're looking at
we're basically saying other people can
make your decisions better than you can
so that's why it should be a law because
you're bad at making decisions
it's true
people are bad at making decisions it's
true
that if you had some kind of a system
where
dumb people couldn't make decisions and
by the way we're not talking about dumb
people in
in this context none of the people
involved are dumb
which is the interesting part none of
the people are dumb
whatever is going on
it doesn't seem to be related to logic
or
you know brain power
whatever it is
all right
uh that is your opinion
reframe as a mental health issue
um
that's a definition problem and i'm not
going to go there so i'm being asked you
know suggested
that i should look at the you know trans
issue especially for the super young
kids as a mental health issue i'm not
going to go there and the reason is that
defining mental health
is really murky
because um and the perfect example would
be a
uh the type of narcissist who just likes
to get credit for doing good work
is that a mental illness
because the person who's doing it isn't
having any problem at all
they're doing good work they're getting
credit for it everybody's happy
so it's just a definition man
so
so if you say it's a mental illness
to think you're the wrong gender
i say well we're in pretty
pretty sketchy territory if you can tell
me what my mental illness is and you're
not an expert and by the way it doesn't
seem to be hurting me
it might even help me
so is it a mental illness if it helps
you
what would you make of the people who
transition
and then their whole life they're glad
they did
do they have a mental problem
well actually let me ask this question
uh because i'm not sure how you would
answer
so take the example of somebody who
transitions at five
against your better advice but let's say
it happens
and they grow up and they go through
their whole life after transitioning and
every time they talk about it or think
about it they say you know
pretty glad i did it
does that person have a mental illness
in your opinion
or did they have a medical problem that
they solved perfectly
what's your opinion
some people say yes
so so your definition of a mental
problem
would include
people who improve their lives
what it
so so in in your view of the world there
could be such a thing
as a mental problem that just makes you
better off
and it would still be called a mental
problem
is that definitionally you'd be
comfortable with that
so this is where words become a problem
you know what else i've decided
that there are a whole bunch of things
these are current thinking so this might
come out
not coherent
but i've decided that maybe what i most
want is to be an unlabeled
adult
if i could have one thing that would
make me feel free
is to be an unlabeled adult here's why
if you call me a democrat or republican
then i feel like i have to act a certain
way or defend a certain thing but so i
don't i'm neither a democrat nor
republican
and i don't even vote
so i don't want to be labeled
likewise i make sure that it's hard for
you to know if i lean right or left
because i seem to go either way
depending on the topic
and i like that i want to be unlabeled
as left or right but i'm taking it
further
i think i would want to be unlabeled as
you know married boyfriend
engaged single or any of the other
categories
why do i have to be labeled
because the moment you put a label on
any of those things you have to conform
to the label
right
as soon as you say you're married well
you got to do what married people do
that's that's the whole deal
as soon as you say you're anything then
you've got to do what that category does
but what if you just say
i'm unlabeled
every single situation i can just do
what makes sense to me in that situation
and i will never have to conform to what
my label is
and if you just told everybody that
saying well you should have done well
why why should i have done that why
can't i just look at every situation
individually and do what i want why
can't i be an unlabeled adult
so that's my my goal to be unlabeled
yes good point over on the locals
platform
i'm being asked what happened to the
grain shortage because of the ukraine
war
it got really quiet didn't it
we have been told that there is a
looming
global famine coming
is there a conspiracy to not talk about
it so we don't hoard or has it already
been solved
because what i expected to happen
was that given that we we see the famine
coming
six months in advance right
can't you grow an entire crop in six
months
am i wrong about that
are there not
available you know lands and facilities
that would not be economical under
normal times
but suddenly everybody who has an extra
acre says i can sell anything i
grow in this there's going to be a
famine
i wonder if the market already adjusted
somebody says no fertilizer available
but that has to do with the size and
yield
and again if you simply grew more
you grew indoors for an example
you could compensate for some but not
all of the fertilizer loss so here's the
question
there one of two things that are
happening here maybe three one thing
that's happening
could be that it's getting solved
and you might not notice it
the other possibility is that we're
gonna lose a hundred million poor people
to starvation who didn't need to starve
in other circumstances
and that there's nothing we can do about
it so we're just not talking about it
because we're not part of the hundred
million
uh
you know i've had the worst
selfish thoughts about this global
famine conversation
and goes like this
it won't affect me because i'm rich
does that make you want to like kill me
it makes me want to kill myself
it's an ugly thought but it's also true
here and i'm going to pile on i'm going
to make it worse
by weird coincidence i live in the town
that's the headquarters
for the biggest supermarket for this
part of the country safeway do you think
that the people who own and run safeway
are going to let their own local grocery
store be the one that doesn't have
product
no i will be the last grocery store on
the planet that still has stuff
in it because the people who work at the
grocery the ones who run the grocery
store you know the ceos and stuff they
live in my town they're not going to run
out of food in their town
they're not going to let their own
family starve so at least at least they
i'll have food but
i keep thinking that i
like there's something that's going to
activate me
to make me think i need to talk more
about this or do something or be
productive or help or
you know advise you to stock up or
something
but there's nothing activating me
and to the point from the locals
platform
why not
where did this story go
was it always true that we could have
expanded the global food supply just
maybe not with the exact same foods
just a different mix of foods was it
always there we just always could have
done it we just didn't have to and now
we are
is that what's happening
who knows
food will not make it to your area if it
got bad that's true california at least
makes a good amount of food
depending on the season
uh aren't we risking nuclear war with
russia it doesn't look like it you know
the reason that we're not risking
nuclear war with russia at the moment is
why are we not risking nuclear war with
russia
because they're winning
they're winning the the winning side
doesn't really need to unleash unleash
the nuke that wouldn't turn out well
so
if as long as putin thinks he's winning
i'm not really too worried about the
nukes
now
um it appears we've reached the
afghanistan phase of the ukraine war
where we got ourselves into something we
can't get out of and it's it's looking
like it's a 20-year war
it's going to be trillions of dollars
and we were so dumb
that we walked right into it again
now
you could say but at least we saved
ukraine
did we
did we
did we save ukraine because to me it
looks like it's destroyed
and that it will
be that way for a long time
so i don't think we saved ukraine
but maybe we uh you know we showed putin
a lesson and bolstered nato
didn't we
is nato the a better fighting force
because we've got sweden in there
thank goodness
we we we didn't know if we could push
russia back but
now sweden's in the fight did we gain
anything
anything
i don't know i don't think we gained
anything did we
but we felt like we were on the moral
side of things
now
if what we did
africa is a ukrainian war pushes somalia
toward famine yeah the washington post
had that story
but
pushes toward is still not
you know reached there i mean i don't
doubt there will be some places that
will have severe problems
but
so there's something going on that the
news is not telling us which is did we
solve the problem or just what the hell
is going on
psychologically we gained you think we
gained psychologically
all right
yeah what happened to al qaeda there's
another question what happened to al
qaeda
i guess they weren't the uh perpetual
force we thought
all right
that's about all i've got for now
and
um i'm going to say goodbye to the
youtubers
have a great weekend
bye for now
