thank you
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
sometimes with proper lighting
oh there we go that's better way better
you know uh if you'd like to take this
experience up to a level where nobody's
ever even seated it's that's
unbelievable it's hard to even imagine
well you could do it all you do is a cup
or a bug or a glass of tank your Chelsea
style in the canteen jugular flask of
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now on the
the parallel pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing makes everything
better it's cold the simultaneous Sip
and you're all here for it aren't you
you are go
so much to talk about today
remember I told you that the
Machinery of how things work was
becoming obvious boy today is one of
those days
we're going to talk about the Machinery
of how everything got the way it is
I think you're gonna find it amazing
probably so stick around
all right let's start with the tragic
Maui wildfires if you've never been to
Hawaii this probably doesn't mean as
much to you
but this one hits really close to home
uh literally because uh
um I used to own a property there that
my ex has now but it's part of the part
of the risk of the Maui fires and the
entire downtown area of Maui was
destroyed you know there's only one area
on the whole island that's sort of a
little downtown place with restaurants
it's gone
completely burned up people were jumping
in the ocean to avoid the the fires it's
horrible
the good news
is that it's probably the most valuable
real estate
in almost the entire world
so it'll definitely build back
it'll probably happen really quickly but
the the part that's bugging me
is I could have been there
that this was actually one of the weeks
that was on my short list but I ended up
not not booking it
um primarily because
primarily because you know I had some
book publishing deadlines that didn't
work out but I actually kind of been
there I could have been right there like
actually right there in the middle of it
that's where I was going to be
so it's really kind of freaking me out a
little bit watching the devastation
I remember a story I think it's true
about uh
Seth who's the guy who did the family
Seth what's his name
uh did the Family Guy
Seth macfarland
I heard he was late for a flight that
ended up being one of the flights they
hit the World Trade Centers on 9 11.
is that a true story
that he missed the flight and that's the
only reason he's alive
yeah that I'm feeling a little bit like
that because it was only because other
events in my life
you know did what they did that this
became a week that wasn't possible to
travel
so anyway
uh the news today
because we can see the Machinery behind
the news
it all starts to look like comedy
and here's a perfect example just the
other day I saw a long thread of all the
hilarious claims made about climate
you've probably seen it so they take the
headlines from over the years and when
you see them all together they become
hilarious individually not so much but
only when you see them together for
example the news would say
climate change is causing more dandruff
and then climate change
is being caused by jumping up and down
and there's like every weird thing that
climate change is caused by or causes
and so CNN says the Maui fires
uh in part caused by dry down vegetation
and probably that's the climate change
that's the climate change
now I'm no scientist
but can somebody help me out on this
if it gets hotter over a desert
then it's just hotter would you agree
if it's a desert and the temperature
goes up the only thing that changes is
it gets hotter
now suppose you're an island
surrounded by an ocean
and it gets hotter
now help me with the science
does that make it rain the same amount
or more
can somebody answer that question
if it's warmer
does it rain more
it does doesn't it or at the very least
it would be humid
and humidity is you know good for the
plants as well so wouldn't the global
wouldn't climate change have made
it wetter
in Maui
can I'm seeing somebody disagreeing so I
actually I'm not I'm not stating this as
a fact it's actually a question
or could you say more accurately could
you say there's no way to know
now obviously the the heat would be
evaporating more from the island
but wouldn't it be creating more wetness
around the island that would compensate
for that or no
okay
would you say that we can't tell
would you say that it would be fair to
say we don't really know
if you talk about an island if you talk
about a desert I feel like we'd know
I don't know if the island thing works
the same though
all right so I'm not going to say it's
right or wrong I'm going to say it's
hilarious the CNN States it as a like
some some kind of observable fact
it's an observable fact
do you do you feel like you could just
put that out there as the news
or would it be more appropriate to say
you know
you should look into it because maybe
there's some weather correlation here
but I doubt it I kind of doubt it I
don't know
all right Elon Musk tweeted a great
product engineering and design session
today with the X team now if this had
been anyone else in the world
who said they had a great meeting
I don't think I'd be talking about it
thank you
because a lot of people who had a great
meeting today I had a great meeting
but when musk tweets do you think she's
you know important enough to tweet that
he had a great product engineering and
design session today
I feel as if something big is coming
or probably multiple big things
at one point I believe musk said that X
had the potential
to be the most valuable company in the
planet
do you remember him saying that it had
the potential to be the most valuable
I think he can see the end State now
I think you can see it now now the way
that could happen is if x becomes your
bank as as I just saw in the comments
if x became the bank that you preferred
and it should it should because do you
know what's wrong with banking like
traditional banking does anybody know
what's wrong with traditional banking
everything
everything
yeah traditional banking is has never
been let's say innovated into a good
form because nobody was ever strong
enough to innovate where there was so
much regulations
it's almost impossible to innovate in
the banking environment because there's
just too much Payola and political
pressure and all that stuff right so a
new entrant is going to get destroyed by
the existing players because they don't
want any competition to their their good
deal
so how could anybody ever innovate
in the banking industry
when the banking industry is so strong
and so wretched that they can stop you
from innovating they can just shut you
down through politics and whatever well
I only know of one way that could happen
you would need somebody who is the
richest person in the world
who also has the largest balls in the
world who also has a long-term interest
in this very thing you know he's been
trying to do something like this for
decades and on top of that is one of the
most clever and capable product makers
of all time especially complicated
products yeah complicated products
that's a sweet spot
so could musk do what nobody else could
do which is create a an online bank of
some sort that would do everything a
bank would do but better
and you know what the answer is
probably
probably
I'll tell you if I could if I could
invest directly in Twitter
I definitely would
I definitely would it's not guaranteed
you know it's it would still be a
speculative kind of more speculation
than an investment I guess but
I feel like he's got a serious at least
uh at least a 40 percent chance of
making this work
would you say 40 chance that you can
turn X into your your essentially your
bank
yeah I think he could
it would be the highest level of
difficulty but he's exactly the person
who can do the highest level of
difficulty
I also like the fact that the path is
clear meaning that there's there's
obviously an opportunity if you can get
to it right getting to it is the hard
part
but it's there and he has the tools
yeah there's a cool new little uh 3D
printed house
uh not the kind that they're 3D printing
with concrete you've seen those but uh
they're 3D printing the you know just
parts that they snap together for the
house
so it's a 200 000 house you can buy for
as 400 square feet so it's small
but they put it on a truck
and deliver it but here's the cool thing
it makes its own electricity
and it makes its own water
it makes its own water
it makes its own water
which is the thing yeah they could take
it out of the air absorb it now I'm sure
it needs a little uh starting water
I don't think you could take too many
showers with the water it's creating out
of the air overnight but it also
recycles and cleans the water you have
so your your shower is actually
repurposed and you're using most of the
same water the next day
now if that's not too creepy for you
this is very cool so this exists it's
not it's a it's for sale it's a real
thing
is prefab they just deliver it set it on
the ground I don't know what they do
about sewage
uh maybe the article said and I missed
it so the only thing that's left is
sewage but but I know for example there
are toilets that don't need
a sewage connection you know Bill Gates
was working on that I don't think
they're quite where they need to be but
maybe they've got some information there
too
more important than that Innovation is
that AI
there are now a number of apps that use
AI to remove the clothing from people in
photographs
I don't know about you but finally we
got a killer app you know ai's been
around for a little while and I keep
saying well what am I going to use it
for
I think I'll use it for well I don't
know how to do that I think I'll use it
in my business to
I don't know how to do that but you know
I could use AI
I could use AI to organize all of my
Archive of Dilbert comics so you could
well I don't know how to do that
okay so but I could use AI to help me
draw the
okay I don't know how to do that
but I can tell you what I could do I
could use AI to help me market
I don't know how to do that
um but what I could do is you use AI to
help me write the jokes but it can't
really do that but I could use AI to
organize all my finances and keep my I
don't really know how to do that
um but AI is very very valuable and
believe me
it's going to be the thing
I just don't really know how to use it
however there is an app that will allow
me to take a picture and push one button
and remove the clothing from the person
in the picture
that's it
I got my killer app
finally
finally all this wasted blah blah blah
Ai and we found we finally found one
thing we can use it for which is beating
off to people we know
and I think you've probably noticed that
that's
sort of a big problem
you'll be like you know I'd really like
to have a little more fun with these
Facebook posts than I have been
and then you see somebody in your Social
Circle and you think to yourself
you know
if only
you take the AI app and like there we go
there we go
all right that's the most important
story of the day
why is it do you believe that people
think that UFOs exist is it because the
clear photographs we have at the UFOs is
that why they think they're existing no
we have no clear photographs
is it because very credible people
have gone under oath and said oh my God
I've seen it I've talked to people I
know it's true we got these UFOs and
these captured down aliens and they're
all in a big Warehouse somewhere
why would you believe somebody like that
what would cause you to believe
well I think that what would cause you
to believe is that you can't imagine
this is a failure of imagination problem
you can't imagine how anybody would tell
such a
incredible lie
like who in the world would go in public
and tell a lie this ridiculous
because one thing we know
we know this for sure no credible
seeming person you know somebody that
you would imagine would be credible
something with
credentials and maybe you know a serious
career nobody like that would go in
public in public
and tell you the biggest weirdest lie in
the world
that would never happen
so you just sort of normally assumed
that they might be telling the truth
right
now suppose that these UFO
whistleblowers
who are otherwise credible seeming
people
suppose that it happened in the context
of
oh let's say soon after the Russia
collusion hoax
yeah or soon after the laptop pokes
or soon after
the entire pandemic
or soon after the Biden crime family
story was being ignored in the mass
media like this nothing
or well
I could go on
how long do you want me to go listing
situations which we've confirmed
confirmed seemingly credible people who
you imagine couldn't possibly tell a lie
that big stood in front of you and not
only told lies that big
but bigger
yeah
so when you look at the UFO
whistleblower instead of saying to
yourself my God nobody would tell a lie
like that I mean that would be ruining
their reputation nobody would take a
risk like that nobody's that stupid
and then you watched
40 hoax is being played on the public in
real time while you watched
and people did believe all of them not
everybody in the same way that not
everybody believes the UFO stories but
you could get half of the country
to believe absolutely anything that
comes from the mouth of a seemingly
credible person
and it's always because of a lack of
imagination if you can't imagine that
person could look you in the eye and lie
to you about something amazingly untrue
then you assume they might be telling
you the truth
because you just can't imagine the
alternative
but isn't it a little bit easier to to
imagine the seemingly credible people
who look very honest are telling you
complete and they're fully
aware of it
that's actually the operating system of
2023. in 2023 it's nothing but
credible people lying to you
nothing but
UFOs credible people lying to you uh
Biden crime family credible people lying
to you oh but now when I say lying
I don't mean lying Always by
facts that are not true the lots of ways
to lie let me give you an example
as Politico reported not a single dollar
has been traced going directly to Joe
Biden
oh yes foreign countries that we have
some issues with yeah they have paid
massive amounts of money to all the
family members and we do know that the
family members or at least one of them
Hunter has been paying the bills for the
big guy so those things are not in
question but let me tell you not a
single dollar has been proven to go
directly to Joe Biden
now
is that true
well technically
is it meant to fool you yes it's meant
to fool you as in if this is true well I
guess Joe Biden never was influenced by
any money
foreign
every story is seemingly credible people
lying to you now when there are people
on both sides
you know you it's harder to tell who's
lying to you but there is no major story
that doesn't have lots
of seemingly credible people lying to
you and knowing they're doing it
so lying to you from the point of a
seemingly credible position is the
normal routine
universal truth of every major story
it's not the exception it's the
universal truth
and that's something that's obvious in
2023 that I don't think was obvious 10
years ago
it wasn't obvious to me I mean I always
assumed that you know there was lots of
lying and Corruption
but I didn't really think it was
Universal
I kind of I kind of allowed myself to
think well
you know the FBI is not crooked
right
or or at least you know the FDA is
looking out for us
ten years ago I would have said that I
would have actually said that 10 years
ago yeah it looks like these entities
are doing a good job looking out for us
I actually would have thought that was
true 10 years ago and now you know it's
not right you're not guessing if you
paid attention at all for the last I
don't know six years you know that none
of it's true
you know that 100 of all of our systems
are corrupt
maybe not corrupt enough to stop working
but certainly corrupt
so don't wait for the aliens is what I'm
saying
um I heard there's uh some news from a
study
that people who are dating prefer to
date people who have the same
vaccination status
does that surprise you
I would say not surprised because
vaccination status is a proxy for a
whole bunch of
uh political thought wouldn't you say
the people who are unvaccinated
generally have a lot in common with each
other right
so isn't it perfectly normal that the
unvaccinated would prefer unvaccinated
people because they think alike
so independent of what their what are
their bodies may or may not be doing
they think alike they they're both
distrustful of authority and took the
the most skeptical position
and would like to know that they're with
people who could have done the same
thing makes sense and likewise the
vaccinated think they made the right
choice so they want to be with other
people who in their opinion made the
right choice makes sense but here was
the the least surprising part of the
study
the people who were least likely to care
if their partner was vaccinated or
unvaccinated were the bisexual people
in this study
I don't know did you see that coming
that the bisexual people were not fussy
about their partners
did anybody see that coming
all right well you can make your own
jokes about getting jabbed I'll let you
do that on your own time
I think it's just funny that we had to
call out bisexual people who are by
definition the most open-minded people
about I guess pansexual will be even
more but bisexual people they're
open-minded by Nature
if your genderism goes slow them down I
don't think your vaccination status is
all right which is not making I'm not
making fun of bisexual people in case
you're wondering
um
I would like to read some inspirational
words from our leader
you know one of the things that leaders
can do for us is Inspire us and I don't
think we appreciate enough when that
happens so if I may
if you would indulge me I'd like to read
some inspirational words
from one of our greatest leaders Joe
Biden President Biden and he said and I
quote
imagine if a long time Roosevelt and
telephones came along and said we're not
going to help invest in telephones
come on man
now those are words to live by
when I saw that this morning I was
feeling a little down and I thought yeah
yeah
imagine if Roosevelt
and telephones imagine if Roosevelt and
telephones
yeah yeah I mean that got me going so I
hope I had the same impact on you
um looks like YouTube stopped comments
so your comments have died temporarily
on YouTube but I think you see me
I think it's live over on the locals
platform or you you still see me right
by the way the locals Tech team is
monitoring you right now so if you have
any comments about what device you're on
or if you're on the browser or the app
uh what's working what doesn't
background stuff you could say your
comments in the comments and they will
see them because they're watching them
right now all right so so please give
your feedback about your technical
experience
uh YouTube is back okay YouTube's back
online
um
it looks like some people have to
refresh on YouTube
all right well you're all back yay
um
Trump uh I guess the Department of
Justice
tried to get a hold of Trump's old
Twitter account so they could look at
all his DMS and maybe
maybe draft messages he didn't send
and the the report is that musk and
Twitter refused to give it to him and
got fined 350 000 by trying to fight to
keep Trump's private information on
Twitter from his old account private
so thank you
so thank you to Twitter and to Elon Musk
for spending three hundred fifty
thousand dollars
fighting the bad guys it looks like they
lost the bad guys got what they wanted
but thank you
that if you're if you're wondering if
that was money well spent
absofucking lutely
because you know why
that 350 thousand dollars told me that
musk would protect my private
information
or at least try
now he failed but how happy am I that he
spent 350 thousand dollars trying to do
something that was probably going to
fail but at least he was working on the
benefit of the the users
not the benefit of the the government
so yes big yes for that uh if anybody
thinks that's wasted money nope
that was that was some of the best money
spent
because that told the rest of us what
the deal is right the deal is he's going
to protect your information if he can
even if it's expensive
great message
great marketing
all right um there's an Iowa poll
that says Trump's lead is growing at
least for the Iowans DeSantis is
dropping like a rock according to Trump
so the numbers are Trump 43 that would
make him 26 up on DeSantis in second
place coming in at 17 but interestingly
Tim Scott jumped to third place with 11
11 support in this poll uh you're going
to ask me what is the percentage of the
black population in Iowa Scott it's
about four percent
so for Tim Scott to be in third place at
11 percent
you know more than double the ratio of
black citizens of Iowa
that's pretty good performance I don't
know what's behind it I don't know if
this this will stand up in other states
but I'd like to call it out good job Tim
Scott
and Trump actually called out Tim Scott
and he calls him ramashwami but Vivek
ramaswamy I'm pretty sure it's Rama
Swami not rameshwami but
yeah yeah
poorest of fake's gonna have to change
his name here for you if he wants to
stay in politics
um and then Pence and rest are back at
three percent two percent
but uh
but Vivek is is double
he's double the Lesser competitors
but the Tim Scott thing is interesting
do you think the Tim Scott
support
is because people are trying to help
Trump
do you think that's what that's about
that's what it feels like
I I feel like
Trump's entire base feel like they're
all advisors
does do Biden's does Biden's base feel
that way
from day one when Trump entered the race
as just a consumer of information and a
citizen of the United States I fell from
day one
that if I had a good suggestion
he would consider it
which is weird
and then later on I had some good
suggestions and he considered it you
know what one of the executive orders
was to make Telehealth legal across
state lines
that was literally something I suggested
that worked its way up through the
through the uh
you know the system
until he signed an executive order it
was literally because I suggested it now
I I felt that from the start I felt from
the start that Trump would see a good
idea from anyone
and say well that's a good idea yeah I'm
going to do some of that that's a that's
a good good thing right there
and he does
so when you see people uh voting up
Tim Scott
I feel like that's his his base
sort of collectively and either
consciously or subconsciously saying you
know what would be great
if you became president Trump again
except this time your supporters are not
all called racists
would that be cool
would it be good they would say do not
be called racist for four years of your
presidency
and one way you could get that done
would be a vice president Tim Scott
so do you think that the base is is sort
of
answering a poll
but also they feel like advisors like
hey hey hey you know what you need
you need your vice president to have a
little flavor
right Mike Pence wasn't just white
he was so white that he drains the color
out of the neighboring scenery
like he can walk into a forest and if he
stands there long enough the trees start
looking gray
I don't know if you notice that he can
absorb color
from anything he's the whitest human
being who's ever walked and by the way I
like Mike Pence
I've always been a bike bed supporter
lots of character don't agree with
everything you said about January 6.
don't agree with some of that but as a
solid citizen a person you would like to
have as your neighbor
solid guy I thought he was a solid vice
president
but he's the whitest guy who ever lived
yeah so
I feel like even Vivek might be part of
that equation but the difference is the
Vivek matches up as a a strong partner
typically a vice president is a weak
partner
like kamla Harris she's a weak partner
but during the Clinton administration
Al Gore was a strong partner so Al Gore
had some portfolios which actually were
serious ones and he was taken seriously
and you know dined with the president
all the time Etc
so I think Vivek would be the
the perfect
answer to Trump
so if it turns out that if a vague
doesn't take it directly which I still
think he has a chance of doing that
that's you know and I still I still I
endorse Vivek he's my first choice
but he's the perfect compliment to Trump
perfect compliment
anyway
um
Trump says he's not likely to debate but
the Republicans gave him just the
perfect
excuse to say no
deciding the pledge that they would back
whichever one of them
Nation
and
Trump smartly
he's the smartest one in the game when
it comes to this stuff specifically
negotiating basically uh Trump says I
wouldn't sign that why why would I sign
something when in fact there are a few
of the candidates that I wouldn't back
now what are you really not back a
republican I doubt it
so it's not about whether we really
would that's a completely separate
question why would he give up his right
to not do it
why would he give up is right
for nothing
there just wouldn't be any reason
there would be no reason whatsoever
by the way for the locals people I'm not
using a plug-in microphone I'm just
using the iPad microphone
there's a reason I told them that
there's a back story
um
anyway
so Trump won't debate but more
importantly and he explained it very
clearly he has nothing to gain
Trump's poll numbers are actually
increasing
you don't you don't debate when you're
at the top and increasing your lead
that would literally be stupid
I'm not sure I'd want to vote for the
guy who did something that stupid
now he does he does the good talk where
he says I really like to do it you know
I'm a good debater I I really like to
but I just can't because I can't sign
this pledge it's just perfect he has the
perfect out and they just handed it to
him
so he doesn't have to say he's scared of
debating
but he should be
yeah As Good As Trump is at debating and
he's great he should be afraid of it
because it's all downsides there's not a
single good thing that could happen if
he's on the stage
well he's making right choice
I saw a comedian Dave Smith refer to Sam
Harris doing some podcasts and stuff
lately as the Sam Harris humiliation
tour
now the background on this if you don't
know so Sam Harris
prior to Trump and prior to the pandemic
was a I'd say a famous American
intellectual
who was well known as being the most
rational
fact-based thinker
in America you know at least one of them
one of the most rational people in
America who could not only be rational
but he could explain to you how to be
rational you could spot irrationality
like a real
asset to the country
but something happened
and here's what I think the something is
so Sam Harris's entire identity
would you agree I'm trying to do this
without mind reading all right so
wherever you see any mind reading just
discount it if I slip into it
um imagine being the person who
Define themselves as the person who
could spot truth using a combination of
reason
data and science
reason data and science
and then what would happen to you if you
learn that reason data and science are
ridiculous tools for finding out what's
true and will lead you in the wrong
direction because everybody was lying to
you
what would you do
could you say you know I gotta admit the
entire purpose for my life's work has
been a joke and I was just fooled and
that it turns out the science is not
Dependable even a little bit because
they're all liars
and the data is not Dependable even a
little bit because it's all motivated
data all data is motivated even when
somebody doesn't know they're motivated
they're motivated
to collect the data that was within a
certain range so all data is motivated
all scientists are liars
whether they whether they do it
intentionally or not and reason is not a
skill that humans have
so how would you like to build your
entire life on these three pillars you
know data reason and Science and then
learn beyond the shadow of a doubt that
these are worthless things just
worthless
now
they might be better than the
Alternatives but they don't work
even though they're better than the
Alternatives and what I mean by that is
for any one question science is terrible
but science is really good if you give
it 50 years
to crawl toward the truth and eliminate
these certain untruths right so science
is the best we have
but if you strive to decide in the
moment with all new data and and money
is flying around like crazy in different
directions and you don't know if the
data is real you don't know if the
scientists are lying and you're not even
sure that people are reasoning out the
situation right
your tools are worthless but in the long
run
I think we might actually understand
what happened during the pandemic
maybe in 20 years
but not now
and so I think that it's a massive
cognitive dissonance bomb uh in theory
it should hit the hardest with somebody
who's most committed to data reason and
science those are the people who should
be according to science here's the fun
part
science would predict
that Sam Harris would go crazy onto this
scenario science would because science
is what came up with cognitive
dissonance that wasn't invented by me
science came up with that
cognitive science
so science tells you if you put somebody
in the exact situation that Sam Harris
is in there's a very predictable outcome
one major apology oh my God I can't
believe I was even involved in any of
this
which is nearly impossible for a public
figure it's nearly impossible
it's it's done you've seen it done but
when it happens it's so rare that it's a
national story
by far the most common outcome would be
imagining he was really right all along
and the people who may have been right
in reality were a bunch of big old
idiots and they should be they should be
maybe censored or something
um
but trusting the experts would have made
you wrong about everything and I think
that's the problem
trusting the experts the science and the
data and even reason
made him wrong about just about
everything for a while
but I would have optimism that once he
got out of that situation he would be
back to normal
um
now to be fair
all right if I don't add this next part
you should ignore everything I've said
right so listen to this next part
one of the possibilities about how I'm
seeing the Sam Harris situation
is that the person who's having
cognitive dissonance
is me
that explains everything I observe
there's nothing it doesn't there's
nothing unexplained to me right you're
having your own experience but within my
head and my experience I have no way to
tell
if Sam Harris is experiencing you know a
mental health issue with some cognitive
dissonance or
it's all me
no way to know
no way to know now many of you might
agree with me but if I had a liberal
audience they'd be agreeing with him
right now
so I can't even use the audience to tell
me what's real
all right
so here's uh
here's your next story
um
now that Politico has informed us that
Joe Biden the president uh there's no
indication that he directly received any
payments as I said no information that
he directly got payments from Ukraine or
Russia or China or Kazakhstan or
anywhere else
uh which makes me think he should change
his campaign slogan
so his first campaign slogan was no
Malarkey but I think he should update
that to no direct payments to my
checking account
no direct payments
do you like it do campaign slogan
because no Malarkey I'm not sure no
Malarkey is holding up
no Malarkey is sort of the the cats the
cats on the roof
no Malarkey hey hey
no problem the cat's just on the roof
there's no malarkey
but once the cat falls off the roof and
is taken to the the Animal Hospital
that's when maybe your no Malarkey
should evolve to no direct payments to
my checking account
well direct payments to my expenses yes
but we're not talking about that yeah
the direct payments did go to the
companies I owed money to but there were
no direct payments to my checking
account
I don't see why you're all so angry no
direct payments to my checking account
not Direct
not direct people come on man
come on man
not Direct
that's a good slogan I think he saw that
and I saw a statistic that the Atlanta
this was on Twitter Atlanta police I
wish I'd written down who tweeted it
Atlanta police estimate that a thousand
individuals are responsible for 40 of
the crime in a four-week period they
charged 75 people with more than 1800
combined arrests
75 people
it's the same 75 were arrested 1800
times in four weeks
that's just one month people
now this reminds me of the dumbest thing
I ever heard
many years ago long before I added an
involvement in a political commentary I
lived in California and we had this
three-strike law that got passed
during the debate about the three-strike
rule which would take somebody who was a
triple offender and put them basically
in jail for life so they couldn't offend
and the people who said that that was
you know let's say
not just unfair but you know cruel and
unusual punishment
it probably was pretty cruel definitely
cruel
but
the argument was from the left
that putting the people who who do all
of the crimes in jail forever would not
reduce the crime rate
let me say that again
adults
with actual jobs
people who could find their way to work
every day
would say this with a straight face
if you take the people who do all of the
crimes and you put them in a jail
forever
the crime rate would stay the same
if all the people who do the crimes are
gone the crime rate stays the same
and they would say that on television
they would say it in the news
and they didn't even blink when they
said it
that was that was when I realized that
everything was broken
the fact that the news uncritically
reported
that that smart people were saying the
crime rate wouldn't change if there were
no criminals
they actually said that
and with a straight face they said it
repeatedly and here's the worst part
nobody refuted it
I mean I did but nobody was listening
and I would say to friends who would
tell me that you know cocktail parties
or whatever now say you know there's a
part of that I don't understand
in order for the crime rate to stay the
same when the criminals who do the
crimes are gone
wouldn't that require non-criminals to
step up and start doing crimes just to
keep The Wraith the same
so are you telling me that putting
career criminals in jail causes honest
people to become career criminals to
fill in the gap
is that your argument
do you know what people said when I
mentioned that
well look at my drink looks like it's
evaporated I'll be right back
no there's no argument to it there's no
argument
there's no argument at all it's just
it's just math
all right if you're not there you're not
there
well take that uh
take that and bring it forward
so there's a story now in New York Post
John Stossel wrote about Judith Curry
you've probably heard of her famous
climate scientist who's not an alarmist
and she's answering the question which
you may have wondered
how could it be that 97 or 98 of
scientists say climate change
is true
and it's a big problem
I do need a haircut you're right maybe
today
I was noticing that but thanks for
pointing that out in the middle of my
presentation
because you know what you like to hear
when you're
trying to explain something complicated
you know
there's something about the way you look
that's kind of weird and maybe you
should do something about it
that's exactly The Surreal thing I like
to hear right in the middle of my
presentation
something about your hair that's wrong
maybe you could fix that although you're
right I mean it's not like you're not
right
I'm just saying there's a Time
there's a time and a place that's all
I'm saying anyway you probably didn't
know that I'm watching in the comments
as I'm talking but I do I actually
watched the comments as I talk
it's not easy
but I do
all right um
something about everyone's hair is wrong
all right so my point was that Judith
Curry explained this now this is
something that I'd say most of the
people on the right already knew
but my theme today as you know is that
we can now see the Machinery of how
everything works
and we saw the Machinery of the Biden
family corruption right now you can see
all the parts so there's no question
about it we saw the Machinery behind the
Russia collusion hoax
right we saw the Machinery behind how
the laptop hoax was created
so what's different about the current
year is that the Machinery of things you
know the the hidden mechanisms that make
things work are now all obvious you can
see them all so let me explain in case
you didn't know
why 97 to 98 of scientists could say
something that many people think is
overblown or too too alarmist
and the reason is that they get paid to
do it
that's it
that's the whole fact they get paid
and follow the money works every time
would you like to see me make uh 98 of
scientists believe that the government
has alien corpses do you think I could
do it
oh yeah I could all I have to do is
announce enormous government grants
for people who could prove the aliens
are real
do you think I could get a lot of
studies proving aliens are real if
that's where all the money was yes I
could and then once there are a whole
bunch of studies that say aliens are
real and a whole bunch of people who
make money from it what would happen if
somebody published a paper and said
aliens aren't real look at the data
well first of all the peer review would
fail
because the peer reviewer would say I
just published a paper and made a lot of
money saying that aliens are real so
your paper I find some flaws in it sorry
there's some flaws in your so I'm going
to ignore it
right it's just money
if you think that money can't convince
98 of any group to do anything
have you met money
I don't think I have any laying around
but I'd like to introduce you to it
because it makes everything happen
follow the money works every time there
are no exceptions
find me the exception and I'll tell you
why you're wrong about it
if you find one
so
um yeah and you know Judith explains the
exact mechanism how the grants are given
how if you complained you would lose
your job at the University
it's just money
so if you thought that 98 of scientists
agree
is a sign of science
that's malarkey 98 of scientists agree
is almost certainly a sign of fraud
because you can't get 98 to agree on
let's say a newish thing you could get
them to agree on something that settled
science for 50 years right they can do
that
but if you want somebody to get 98 to
agree on something that's happening
right now oh like let's say
a pandemic
do you think 98 of experts and
scientists largely agreed about the
pandemic sure they did they did I would
say 98 of them were on the same side all
the way through
is that because they all did their own
independent research
no it's because every one of them knew
that they couldn't keep their job
if they spoke out against the people who
said it was true
now did they believe what they were
saying
I don't know
but I'll tell you what I can guarantee
if I pay you enough money I can get you
to say anything if I threaten you with
losing your job and it's a credible
enough threat
you'll say anything
will I know if you're telling the truth
no
will some of you talk yourselves into
believing you're telling the truth and
it's only a coincidence that that truth
is what's good for your finances
yes the way a normal human brain works
is if you took a hundred scientists and
you said all right you guys
um
we need you to say something that's
totally not true
will you do it there's a lot of money in
it some of them will say all right I
gotta follow the money I got to feed my
family so I'm going to tell this lie
some of them will actually convince
themselves they're telling the truth
and then take the money
and there will be a lot of them so I
don't know that scientists are lying
I wouldn't say that necessarily although
some are you can say for sure that some
are because some of every group are
lying
but
um
so I have a very funny text coming in
but the person who's texting me doesn't
know it's me
so I I can't tell the the context but
there's somebody texting me about me who
doesn't know they're talking to me
it's kind of funny
[Laughter]
because that well I can't tell you the
details I'm having a conversation about
me with somebody who doesn't know
they're talking to me
all right
the Saudis are looking at reportedly
making some kind of deal in the Middle
East that would include
um recognizing Israel which should be a
big big deal
but in return Saudi would
um get some help building domestic
nuclear power
is that weird
the United States which absolutely sucks
on domestic nuclear energy ramp up
we're going to do it for Saudi Arabia
what we won't do for ourselves
and do you know why we're going to do it
for Saudi Arabia
because it makes complete sense
do you know why we're not doing it in
America
because because we're dumb I guess
there's no other reason it's just dumb
but the Saudis are not that dumb so
apparently they need some they they
would be quite aware that they should
sell their oil
and then use a cheaper source for their
own energy same with Iran Iran's best
economic play
uh
all right let me answer this uh
this is getting deeper
you have
I'm going to talk to one of my
subscribers here
he's getting very mad
he's not understanding what's going on
because he doesn't know he's talking to
me
all right let's see what happens
the
all right I can't wait to see what he
says to that
all right um
then
what else is that deal gonna do
um yeah and then we'd want Saudi to
distance itself from China
and the Palestinians would want the
Palestinian state
um
to get some some kind of a boost
so I don't know how close any of that is
it doesn't look like it's super close
but could we say that the the
possibility of this deal the possibility
of it is built on Trump's success
is that fair that if this deal gets made
which would be really big deal it will
be built on top of Trump's
Success With Jerry Kushner Etc
yeah all good news all good news
all right here's a frame for you that
will uh get you
um
get you thinking
I have a theory and I'm going to close
out on this because it's provocative
I have a theory
that all success well maybe most success
let's say 99 percent
is based on imitation
and by that I mean the successful people
watch other successful people
and they say oh if you do that that
works okay all right oh that works that
works now they don't all follow the
exact same plan
but as a general statement people are
imitating the people who got it right I
will tell you that's my exact process
at around age 12
I said to myself I would like to be
successful
you know that was always my my goal was
always to be more than average
successful
and I said to myself how am I going to
do that I don't you know I was born to a
family that did not have tremendous
resources but
adults told me how they said look all
these successful people
um
all right uh
you
you signed up
all right he's very bad now I'm not
if you don't mind I'm entertaining
myself by he's yelling all caps now
he's really mad now
still doesn't know he's talking to me
let's see what he says
he's hopping mad now
so the generically there's something
that he did that he doesn't know
let's see if he's figured it out yet
ah
all right
um so here's my point if if success is
mostly about studying successful people
and doing what they do at least in terms
of the system or the pattern that they
use
imagine being black in America
and you want to be successful
and you want to do it the way everybody
has always done it
must be a scam since you tell me the
info I'm requesting
all right
um
do you have
FaceTime
let's see if it'll go live on FaceTime
you can have some fun with this
all right I'm going to call him
hello this is Scott Adams we're just
talking uh by text uh you're on live
stream now you've got got several
thousand people watching we're listening
so uh you're signed up for a service
which you did not sign up for it sounds
like so you know you know you never said
if it hasn't
shine that's correct no no
I don't know how to use it no we're not
talking no we're not talking about
FaceTime we're talking about we're
talking about coffee with Scott Adams on
the locals platform
did you ever sign up for that
nope I don't even know what the locals
platform is really
so that's weird so you should definitely
cancel because what it is is a uh it's a
live stream that you're on right now
that YouTube and the locals platform are
listening to
the subscription fee that you see is an
indication that somebody with your
credit card and your personal
information signed you up for the system
now I can do that like that's not
something I can do and I'm the only one
who has control of the system so there's
something
foreign yeah that would be a monthly fee
so you should you should definitely
cancel it well how do I cancel
um if I didn't sign up I don't know how
to cancel send me your email address
that you likely would have used and I'll
cancel it for you or you can just you
just tell your credit card company it's
a fake charge
associated with uh Texas minute or
um no okay all right okay that's the
only thing I can possibly think of all
right no this I usually don't sign up
for anything that I've got to pay for
yeah it sounds like something mysterious
happened but it was what wasn't on my
end because we don't sign people up that
don't want to sign up but if if just
send me your email address if you can't
cancel it from your credit card it'll do
it for you
thank you very much all right bye
that was weird
it was his wife
I didn't want to get into it but yes
yes he's married
it was his wife
and the funny thing is she's probably
watching this right now
yeah she's probably at work or she'll
watch it later if he hasn't canceled it
already and she'd be like oh that's
my husband
[Music]
all right
anyway what I was saying is if success
is mostly imitation
imagine being black in America
so you're you're taught the history of
slavery of course you taught the history
of racism in America of course and in
modern world you're you're learning ESG
and CRT and there's Dei and all these
have the same flavor
which is you're a victim and there is an
oppressor class
and the oppressor classes mostly white
men
now if you wanted to succeed
and you wanted to do it by imitation
would you not be being asked to imitate
your oppressor
am I wrong
how could that ever work
wouldn't you end up with exactly what we
observe
would you not end up with an entire
group of Americans who have what I call
a
maybe a historic ceiling or a glass
ceiling of some kind
so my upside potential is unlimited
because every time I see a new tip or a
new technique I can I can take it he
said oh I'll do that I'll do that I'll
do that but now let me give you an uh an
analogy just so you can put your head in
the situation right
imagine you were Jewish
you lived in Germany
and you realize that the only way you
could succeed was to and you know let's
say it was Hitler's Germany and you
realize the only way you could succeed
is acting like a Nazi
would you do it
probably not
right probably not it would be the one
class of people that you would say okay
I will imitate anybody but them
please can I imitate anybody but the
Nazis I'll imitate anybody else anybody
else just not the Nazis
now take that to America
imagine that you're you know the
descendants of slavery you've lived
through all forms of discrimination
especially if you're a certain age it
was worse
and now you're being taught in schools
that don't forget there was an oppressor
class
and then they say now in order to be
successful
act like the Nazis
the oppressor class
would you do it
I don't think I would
I don't think I would
and do you remember when women were
having a tough time you know reaching
equality in the employment Market
and people would say well if you act
like men
because the you know the free market is
to some extent designed for male
characteristics right competitive
you know doggy dog kind of thing so
if women wanted to succeed they had to
act more like men
and then women succeeded how'd they do
it
how have women succeeded wonderfully
really well
have they succeeded
acting like Batman
they acted like men
now not in you know every masculine
female way but they did the technique
that men do
they went to college
they didn't have children that they had
to be home all the time
they got tougher
you know learn to negotiate
Etc
and basically they copied the pattern of
men
because the the system was designed by
men for men basically so to succeed they
imitated
now do you think that women lost
anything of themselves or their ability
to be happy or anything by imitating men
sorry I fell off my desk
probably yes
but everybody's different so let's
acknowledge the vast differences in
people for many women
best thing ever
best thing ever because they they didn't
mind taking on those characteristics
maybe they didn't need to have babies
soon or at all so for some number of
women it was sort of perfect oh
everything's equal now I can I just do
these things like everybody else and I
get a good result
but imagine being
you know a black kid
and they say well if you want to succeed
act like Bill Gates
and they go who and you say all right
here's Bill Gates here's a picture of
Bill Gates act like that
you're kidding me right nope Bill Gates
here's a picture do what he does
you're seriously you're kidding me
there's not a single chance I'm going to
do whatever he does in fact if you could
give me a list of everything he does
please give me that list so I cannot
even accidentally do anything he does
because that's my oppressor or he
represents my oppressor
now am I wrong
that black Americans have
and I'm not sure it's like anybody's
specific fault
it's just that it's the only group that
can't imitate to succeed
am I right
it's the only group who doesn't have the
path that everybody else has which is
imitation now let me let me further
prove the point
what group of black Americans do in fact
imitate white Americans and then succeed
because of it what subgroup of black
people
imitate white people
there are two correct answers immigrants
immigrants is one answer because
probably because they don't have the you
know the history
and the other group is exactly
Republicans yeah Republicans or
conservatives let's just say
conservatives conservative black
Americans
basically say okay that's what works
that's what doesn't work I got these two
choices a thing that works for everybody
or the path that doesn't work for
anybody
huh
the path that works for everybody
or the path that never works
I'm going to take the path that works
for everyone
and then surprise it works
but it's hard
imagine being a conservative black
person in America do you think they get
any at Family reunions
probably
probably yeah so it's not easy
but here's the thing you need to know
uh I'm an adult white guy if you haven't
noticed
and I hate imitating adult white guys
now to be fair I do play some air guitar
I do and I enjoy it
I'm actually kind of good at it kind of
good at it
but
uh I don't recommend it right it's not
easy it's not easy being white because
you got to eat a lot of cheese you gotta
dress poorly
there's a lot to it
and but the area guitar is
kind of it's kind of essential nobody
wants to be a white guy
we'd all rather be cooler if you gave me
a choice
of being Jay-Z all day long
or Bill Gates all day long
which one do I pick
uh
I think I'll take Jay-Z Thank you very
much
who by the way is an excellent example
of how to succeed
how did yay and well really a lot of
famous rappers and people how did they
succeed
doing it the way white people do it but
they were in an industry in which you
could you know dress the way you want to
dress and present yourself the way you
want to present it but in terms of
technique
the technique was standard same way
everybody does it
work hard take some chances build your
talent stack stay out of jail I mean the
formula is the same for everybody
they just had some talent and they were
in the right industry so you know they
can express themselves as well as follow
a process and entertainment allows you
to do that entertainment is probably the
only place you can actually be yourself
but also follow the same business
process to success you don't have to you
know dress a certain way
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
my insight for today
that
um
I don't know it just looks like there's
some kind of a permanent glass ceiling
on black success because they don't have
the access to what everybody else says
which is imitation
all right
opinion about the Utah man
all right I wasn't going to talk about
this but I guess I will
I didn't want to talk about it because
you're not going to like my opinion
so as I understand the story there was a
Utah man who made some social media
death threats against Biden that's the
story you're talking about
and that the outcome was the FBI killed
them right
am I right
yeah so that's that's the correct story
um
I hate to tell you but I'm going to be
consistent on this and you're not going
to like my consistency
if you was if you resist arrest and your
ass gets killed
I don't care about you
if you threaten the president and this
incredible sounding threat and the FBI
shows up and even if the FBI does
something wrong and your ass gets killed
I don't care
so I feel like you're asking me because
I'm going to say Free Speech uh they're
killing the Republicans no no if you if
you resist arrest and threaten my
president
Joe Biden is my president right I got
some issues
I got some issues with Joe Budden but
he's my president if you threaten his
life and the FBI kills your ass
good for them that's that's one they got
right even if they violated procedure
well they have to answer for any
violation of procedure yeah I'm not
saying that they should do illegal
things I'm not in favor of illegality
but if he got his ass kicked or killed
by doing the thing that should get your
ass killed
don't make that my problem it's not
going to be my issue
yeah but Donna said she thought about
blowing up the White House the
difference was nobody thought she was
serious this is a guy with a lot of guns
and the way he talked did not sound like
a joke
now it might have been and maybe he was
mental and all that but we can't we just
can't show the same amount of empathy
for people who are acting that way
and I have to be consistent about that
have to be consistent I know you want me
to make it political but I can't
just can't make that political
why is Kathy Griffin walking around
because she's not taken seriously
if a comedian makes a joke a singer we
don't take it seriously if a guy with a
gun collection
says repeatedly
that he's got violence on his mind and
the way and a mechanism to do it
basically he said that he had a motive
and he had the means
yeah that guy's in trouble
all right that's all I got to say about
that and YouTube thanks for joining I'll
talk to you
