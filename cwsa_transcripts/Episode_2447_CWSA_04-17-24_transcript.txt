see
me X is
working all right good looking good I
got to do the simultaneous sip because I
think that maybe some of you missed it
this is the makeup sip yeah it's makeup
sip
go do you think we can start this all
over
again did anybody even hear me talking
about Tesla roboox
taxis I don't think you heard anything
the first time I tried this the
stream YouTube Is AO yay all right well
if you didn't hear it that Tesla's going
to have Robo taxis self-driving Teslas
maybe as soon as August and of course
Elon said that self-driving cars are
obviously where you should put all your
emphasis it's the obvious place to go
and um here's what's interesting
20 years
ago almost you know almost right now 20
years ago I wrote a book called the
religion war that was a sequel to God's
debring and in the religion War I
predicted what life would be like
roughly
now and here are the things that are
predicted in the religion War see how
see how well I did 20-year prediction in
fictional
form the number one thing that I said
was uh not number one but one of the
main features was Robo
taxis so in the religion War you could
use your app and walk out in the street
and get in a robo taxi so so far so good
I predicted 20 years from now we'd have
Robo taxis looks like we will I also
predicted there would be a terrorist
cell in every major city in the country
just waiting for an
attack now I think that's actually
happened I think that our open borders
allowed Iran and China and anybody else
who wants to take a whack at us to
install as many terrorist cells as they
want in as many major cities as they
want so presumably they're just waiting
for war with Iran and then the lights go
out or something so I predicted that
that there would be individual terrorist
cells all through the country just
waiting to be activated and I'm pretty
sure that's the case don't know it but
if they didn't send Terror cells when
the Border was open they weren't doing
their job as
terrorists I also predicted that the
drones would be the main instrument of
Terror it's not quite the
case but if you had people in every city
and
drones I think drones and terrorism are
going to be best friends and then I also
predicted that uh Big Data would be used
to find find the prime
influencers so there would be a way to
find who was influencing other people
the most and therefore if he only
controlled the influencers you could
control everybody else and indeed our
intelligence people have built exactly
that they can figure out who are the
influential people specifically so they
can either boost them or shut them down
exactly like I
predicted and then lastly that the only
thing that can save us in this world
world is a
Persuader the only thing that can save
the
world is
persuasion and that's exactly where
we're at so not bad now you can't buy
that book because I got cancelled but it
will be reissued in the coming months
look for look for that notice well Libs
of Tik Tock tells us that a courton
Canna has ordered that the Canadian
government has to pay for it and it's a
uh well Libs of Tik Tock calls it a
mentally ill person but you you be the
desire it's somebody who wants to get U
both a penis and a
vagina um because this person feels not
fully female or fully
male want to have a penis and a vagina
the same person now I'm no doctor but I
have some
advice if you don't make the penis in
the vagina so that they can you know
reach each
other that's a design
flaw that's a design
flaw CU imagine how frustrating you
would be if you were really really horny
and you had a penis in a vagina and you
couldn't fit them together like ah like
what was I
thinking if I just put one on my thigh
and the other one on the other
thigh I could just here and myself
silly now if you're going to go through
all the trouble of having a vagina and a
penis just make sure they fit together
that's just it's just an engineering
sort of a design
recommendation well meanwhile over in
the US Senate where everybody's honest
um Bob Menendez Senator is reportedly
going to blame his wife for uh the at
his bribery trial now Bloom Bloomberg's
reporting that so he's going to blame
his wife now this is the trial where he
was allegedly taking gold bars and
payment from
Egyptians from
Egyptians because I'm going to tell a
joke in a moment and it's important that
you hear that they took bribes allegedly
from
Egyptians and that he's blaming his
wife and I think the defense will be
that she was on her
pyramid yeah I said it
I said it she's on her
pyramid I didn't make that joke up but
it's still pretty
funny uh well meanwhile the uh CEO of
NPR continues to entertain us uh by
being by being a stereotype and a parody
of
herself have you noticed that the the
NPR CEO is like it's like if you were
going to do a joke parody of
somebody who is overly woke it's a
exactly who she is and now uh uh
watching Christopher
rufo uh surface her past tweets and
statements is pretty
hilarious anyway so Christopher rufo
using the CEO of NPR as a speed bag is
just about one of the best shows you
could watch so if you're not watching
his ongoing assault on
NPR you really need to now he's
literally trying to get her fired do you
think that the CEO of NPR needs to be
fired for being an overtly obviously
biased person who couldn't possibly be
the right person to be in charge of a
news organization do you think that's
good enough to be
fired I don't think so but you know that
one white guy who who complained about
all the bias there
suspended
yeah one white guy managed to to speak
up and everybody's like well you're out
here get here white guy we got women and
people of color who who needs need to be
talking all right so NPR uh the longer
this goes on where that CEO keeps her
job the funnier it gets because they're
really digging in on
this and the thing is that NPR becomes a
it becomes a standard by which you're
going to judge all of the corporate
mainstream traditional media so as long
as this one's just sticking out there
like a a thorn it's going to make
everybody look
bad well Governor Nome continues his uh
destruction of everything we care about
uh they passed a law called the
California journalism preservation act
now what do what do you all know about
the names of
laws as Thomas Massie taught you this
yet that the name of the law will always
be the opposite of what it does
that if if you do a law about peace in
Ukraine it's to buy weapons right if you
make a peacekeeper missile it's to kill
people it's to kill people so here they
have the California journalism
preservation act how do you think this
worked well what it was is something
that would uh make the big platforms pay
a journalism usage fee for surfacing the
local journalism on let's say Google do
you know what Google did when they were
asked to pay a fee for the local
journalism H they said some version of
we don't need any local journalism so
we'll just not not carry any news from
California so they just got kicked off
of
Google so that's how you preserve
journalism you make sure nobody can see
it that's you know sort of like with
those insects who are encased in
Amber same thing yeah they're very well
protected but they're dead and you can't
see them but very well protected by the
journalism preservation act just like
Amber well there's a new study that says
that artificial intelligence can predict
political
beliefs by looking at your face an
expressionless face so you're not even
smiling or doing goofy you're just
looking at the CER camera and AI can
determine your political
preferences now turns out people can do
it
too that people can do it just as
easily yeah if anybody's having problems
with the feed just close it and reopen
it
um so are you surprised that Ai and even
people can figure out what your
political leaning is by looking at you
yeah it it doesn't surprise
me you could tell by the
haircut is there anybody here who can't
identify a republican
haircut have you ever seen Steve
Cortez there is such a thing as a
republican haircut I'm pretty
sure anyway Bernie Sanders doesn't have
it but yeah I'm pretty sure I can uh
tell a republican from a a Democrat not
every time but a lot of the times and do
you know why this is not
surprising it's not surprising because
there have been prior experiments in
which we know people can identify mental
illness in other people do you think you
could identify somebody with mental
illness by looking at their
picture yes you do because you've seen
mug shots haven't you if you look at
enough mug shots you could pretty much
pick out the people with mental
illness now in the mo apparently it's
been as zubie recently pointed out on X
zuie pointed out that it's been nine
years that some people have had a trump
derangement
syndrome nine
years can you imagine the level of
mental illness that nine years you would
be just like all wound up about Trump
and I feel like I can spawn mental
illness because the earlier studies said
that people can and when I look at the
Democrats I see mental illness now it's
not a joke it's not a political
statement it's something you have to
take seriously what one part of the
country has confused political
philosophy with mental illness they
actually can't tell the difference and
if you allow their frame to overcome you
you're going to think you're talking
about a political difference and nothing
nothing like that's happening it's just
mental illness and in some cases
inability to analyze
things well let's here's a little uh
some news from rasmon rasmon did a poll
on abortion and by the way I didn't know
this so let do you tell me how many of
you are surprised by these
stats um oh well I'll ask you before I
give the number the number is not 25% so
you you don't have to do the thing where
you're guessing 25% there's no 25% in
this but what percentage of the country
do you you think of America what
percentage of likely voters I think
believe abortion should not be legal
past the first three months of
pregnancy so in other words how many
people think you know it's all right if
it's in the first three months but not
after
66% so two 23 of the
public seems to be flexible if it's in
the first 3 months and way less flexible
after the first three months does that
surprise
you this is one of those topics where I
feel like you have a responsibility to
know what the real numbers
are and I feel like I I you know I was
not being responsible because I've tried
to stay out of it you know the abortion
thing except that I think it should be
in the states to decide and women should
decide but I'm not giving you my opinion
because I don't think you want it it
doesn't help nobody
cares so my opinion shouldn't matter to
anybody um but 2third want something
like um the option how many people do
you think want to ban all abortions and
make them all illegal what percentage of
US voters do you think want to ban all
abortions so even if the health of the
mother is involved Etc
what what
percentage what do you
think it's
14%
14% now I would have guessed a little
bit higher than
that a lot of you are in the
neighborhood I think 5% is a good
gas yeah yeah we're not doing the 25%
thing today um 5% a good guess but
15 um or 14 14 think all abortion should
be
illegal and 12% say abortion should be
legal up to the first 6 months of
pregnancy so there really aren't that
many people 12% who would be okay with
it Beyond six months or even up to six
months uh well 15% believe it should be
legal at any time before the moment of
birth 15% so basically the same number
of people who say it should be
completely illegal under all conditions
is roughly the same percentage who think
that it should be completely legal under
every circumstance so the the two
extremes are equal it's about 15% is on
both sides of never and
always what what do you think is the
right answer when you have 15% roughly
on each side never and then always and
two-thirds are somewhat in that middle
ground where well maybe if it's early in
the pregnancy but otherwise
not what do you think about that let let
me give you a decisionmaking uh
technique that I
learned um I learned from the
police so uh correct me if I'm wrong but
I believe this is the way um you set
speed limits on roads at least where I
am in California so I might have this
wrong so so give me a fact check on this
but I was told once by a police officer
that the way they determine the speed
limit for local stuff I think the
freeways are just the standard speed but
for the more local
roads they they put little sensors there
you know they put that wire across the
street that records your speed as you go
by and they figure out what speed people
will drive if there's no sign
were you aware of that that's how they
figure out what is a reasonable speed
limit first they see how people actually
act in the real world they actually just
monitor them they go oh it looks like
people are going to go 45 miles an hour
here if there's no sign they're just
going to drive 45 so they'll set the
speed limit at 35 they're not going to
SP they don't set the speed limit at
what people actually go at you know they
they pull it down a little bit because I
know people will exceed it so so the
idea here is that they they simply see
what the public thinks is reasonable and
then they set the speed limit right in
the middle of that reasonable zone so if
later people complain you say well I
mean you're a human being we checked
with human beings and this was a
reasonable speed limit for this area now
it looks to me like there there might be
something like that going on with
abortion now if you don't like this just
understand that whatever the abortion
laws are a lot of people aren't going to
like it no matter what it is some large
percentage isn't going to like it but if
you have 2third of the country roughly
in the same
area your most stable law the one that
holds Society together would be
something close to what two-thirds of
the people
want now that's not my opinion of what
should be right I'm not giving you a
moral ethical opinion and I'm not even
saying you should go there that's up to
you I'm I'm I'm not an abortion opinion
guy because I have a penis and I think
my opinion should be you know deboosted
on this
topic I'll be happy to tell you which
topics I think my my opinion should
dominate but not this one not this
one so anyway that's that's probably
where it'll end up somewhere where you
know the states will eventually wind up
with something closer to what the
majority
wants all right uh NBC is doing another
hit job on the xplatform saying that
they found a bunch of Nazi accounts in a
secret way that they're not telling
anybody how they found them nobody
believes that do they as soon as you see
his
NBC and you see his X they're just
competitors NBC may or may not be
influenced by our intelligence people
and they want to put pressure on musk
maybe I don't know but I wouldn't
believe anything the NBC says about
what's happening on
X is that fair don't listen to a
competitor to tell you what the other
company is doing that that's pretty
basic adult Behavior you don't listen to
the
competitor to describe their competition
right they might be right but you can't
depend on it and if they don't show
their work as X is blaming them they're
they're not showing how they found these
Nazis because the ones the knew that
they mentioned as soon as they were
mentioned X said oh thanks we got rid of
them so if every time you mention a Nazi
X says oh yeah we'll get rid of them no
problem then why are you hiding the
number of Nazis and how you found them
obviously they're up to no good I mean
it's not they're not trying to make the
world a better place and X said if you
find Nazis why don't you tell us first
why are you making a story out of it all
you have to do is tell us and we'll take
them off and it's not because it's NBC
News it's their ordinary business they
remove Nazis so you just got to tell
them so that you should see that as just
a hitpiece from a
competitor all right if you're not
following all the law fair trials
against Trump I know they get confusing
because they all kind of run together
but um the stormmy Daniels one um I
think I can summarize that for you I
tried to see if I could summarize it all
in one
sentence so here's the one sentence
summary of the stormmy
Daniels uh trial it goes like this years
ago Trump allegedly issued a stormy a
gag order and then blah blah simulation
Karma bip bop
boop do everybody get that
yeah Trump issued stormy a gag order and
then some kind of simulation Karma thing
popped into existence and then bit B
Boop that's all you need to
know all right uh in Newport Beach
California Colin rug is telling us on X
that there was a shootout so I guess two
people tried to go into this $5 million
mansion some kind of home invasion maybe
they I think the homeowner might have
known them from something but it turned
into a shoe down and the uh homeowner
waxed one of them and the other one shot
himself in the head
allegedly I I've never heard of a home
Invader getting in a gunfight with the
owner and then shooting himself in the
head when he's not actually injured but
he probably thought it wasn't going to
go well after the first guy got
shot what do we think about uh
homeowners shooting Invaders all for it
we're all for it I'd like to see a lot
more stories like
this uh there's no doubt about the fact
that homeowners are increasing their
security and they're increasing their
weaponry and they're going to start
shooting and I'm not in favor of
violence and I'm not in favor of
vigilantism but I can observe it and I
can tell you that our current situation
guarantees it it guarantees it and if
you've got a high-end house and you
don't have a gun and it's legal to get
one you should really think about it
because I think it's going to be
dangerous to just have a high-end house
because the home invasions are going to
go through the roof I don't think
there's any end in sight for
this and here's what I would
recommend if you can put an American
flag anywhere around your
home it should cut down on the number of
home
invasions because it won't take long for
the criminal elements to say wait a
minute that American flag looks
something like what a conservative would
put on a house wait a minute
conservatives are bristling with
Firepower wait a minute maybe I'll Rob
that other house so I would expect to
see a uh huge uptick in Democrat homes
being robbed and Republican homes uh
killing the
robbers until until only Democrat homes
are
robbed well Google employees tried to do
a little sit in on one of their
Executives offices uh trying to get
Google to discontinue doing business
with
Israel and the police came and took them
away so Google is of course uh imploding
with its own wokeness the wokeness is
eating it from the inside so the same
company that gave us a black George
Washington is now protesting
itself so
there's
that
anyway I could not be more entertained
and I mention this all the time by the X
account called bri. a br y. a and he's
publicly creating a uh a sex toy in
which he's using the computer to design
it and Ai and it looks like he's
building a pretty serious sextoy but
it's going to be married with AI so
will'll be the the sex toy part of it
but then I guess you'll have a screen
where you can swipe left until you find
the manor woman who would be an AI who
will be let's say somehow connected
electronically to the other part so you
could have something like a relationship
and something like sex with
AI now as you might imagine as you might
imagine people are going nuts so what
does Bri AI do to his CR Critics on X
who come after him
hard he uses them for
marketing
so so here's an example so he's got 14
million views on one of them I think
timcast was featuring it yesterday so
he's just killing it on the exposure so
somebody uh wrote this on X about his
product this is satanic it's been a
while since I've been floored by the
malignant president of something I've
seen here but man I am effing
floored so Bri AI responds 55% of men
spend their Leisure Time fighting in
pretend Wars with Call of Duty or some
other BS of course they're going to play
pretend sex is risk- free how many men
you know want to fight in a real war
reproductive sex is worth the risk all
other sex
ends all other sex ends
now is that good marketing or
what because don't you want just want to
fight with
them I'm going to fight with you over
that what do you mean all other sex ends
I'll teach you I'll show you I'm no
incel let me send you a another another
angry post on
X let me let me up your
engagement let me let me make you the
biggest story in America trying to stop
you so the harder they try to stop him
the funnier it gets and the better his
marketing gets and the more likely it'll
succeed it couldn't be funnier the
entire the entire business model is
hilarious from beginning to end because
he's doing something that's so
provocative you can't look
away and if you're going to talk about
it you're his marketing it's just
great well in coincidence news Charlie
Kirk is telling us on X that uh one of
the two US plants that create these 155
mm artillery shells those are the good
ones and some other smaller ones I guess
uh went up in
Flames wait
what there are only two places in the
entire in the United States that can
make the shells for these that the
exterior body part for these artillery
pieces there's only two of them and one
of them is on
fire uh what's going on here
now it could be a
coincidence or it could be the first
indication that there are Terror cells
in every single American city now if you
were a terror
cell what would you be
doing if all you have to do is light
something on
fire because setting something on fire
is not the highest level of
difficulty so I I I'm inclined to think
this was an
accident but it does suggest what could
be
ahead because if all it takes is one
match to defeat the United States
military um I think maybe we should try
harder I mean just think about that in
theory if this fire had been started
with one match I doubt it was but just
for you know just for
fun if they took out 50% of our
artillery Manu ufacturing capacity at
the same time our artillery is being
used up in
Ukraine didn't somebody with one match
just basically deactivate the American
Military I
mean I mean come on all right so I'll
keep an eye on that I think it's
probably just an accident
but certainly raises your
eyebrows speaker Johnson
Mike Johnson speaker of the house uh
says he's a wartime
speaker to which we say what war are you
referring to is America in a war I
thought we were just supporting somebody
else who was in a war somebody else is
you know Israel and Ukraine but
apparently according to speaker Johnson
we're in that war well did somebody
declare
war um I I guess we all knew we were but
that's uh that's sort of scary it's just
a just sort of a self-fulfilling
prophecy situation where I feel
like you know it's kind of amazing that
Putin has not done a terrorist act in
the United States isn't it as far as we
know um Trump was
blackmailed uh then years lat she says
there's more filling your own lines okay
I can't really read the long comments
the multi- paragraph ones all right uh I
saw a Biden say the other day that he's
added in 35 polls did anybody see that
just the other day Biden said he was
leading in 35
polls was there any fact checking on
that what was the last time you saw
Daniel Dale the CNN fact
Checker is is he being kept like a a
 in the
basement yeah he's kept as a
right so uh so I went and looked at 538
they keep a list of the uh polls I did
find there are two recent polls that
Biden has had but they the minority it's
like two and a 10 or
something now am I correct in saying
that when you're looking at a national
poll given that all that matters is the
uh the key States the swing States if a
republican is leading even by one
percentage point or even tie in a
national poll doesn't that usually mean
Landslide is that changed if the
Republican and Democrat are running even
in the entire country pole that usually
means total
Destruction the Republican just wins now
we don't expect that because we don't
trust that our elections are a fair too
many moving Parts in our elections and
not auditable so there's no way to know
if we have a real election but every
indication is we do
not would you say that's a fair
characterization there's no proof that
are uh no
court no court approved proof that any
elections have been rigged but all
indications are that they have been
that's you outside of the coure system
which isn't the right vehicle to check
in the first place because they're not
looking everywhere they're not auditing
they're just taking specific
complaints um yeah to me it seems
unlikely that everything that we know is
going on could be going on and yet the
elections would be completely
unrigged how could it be that everything
is corrupt except
that who would believe that that would
be an
absurdity all right here's a reframe
from Dr Andrew huberman uh um I use a
version of this it's adding the word yet
to things you're trying to do that
you're not good at so instead let's say
you're practicing the guitar as I am and
I'm terrible at it and I have to admit
it was kind of
discouraging but I did tell myself some
version of this that I'm not good yet I
reminded myself that a lot of people
learn to play the guitar and they're not
magic people they probably just kept
doing it until they could do it so I
told myself oh I'm not good at the
guitar yet so that I actually use this
reframe and it works now apparently
there's some science behind it if you
say you're not good yet you've created
this you know positive thought for
yourself that will keep you going give
you dopamine oh I'm not good yet but
definitely getting
there um and this is very similar to my
systems are better than goals
the goal is to be good but if you were
just focusing on it you'd say oh my goal
is to be good and I'm not good that's
demotivating but if you're working a
system the system might be well in my
case my system is I put my guitar uh in
my amp where I have to walk past it
every
day and at least one of those times that
I walk past it every day I say to myself
oh I have 10 minutes and I'll pick it up
and and practice so that's my system so
I use a system because the system makes
me feel good so that's what I teach is
if you have a
system every time you do your system
pick up the guitar for 10
minutes you feel
successful so you move you move the you
know the end point away as your as your
thing you're looking at and you just
look at the system and then he had
another
one another reframe Andrew huberman did
um that stress most mizes resources so
instead of saying oh I feel stressed oh
I feel so bad today because I'm stressed
I'm so stressed it feels bad that will
make you feel bad but if you define that
feeling of stress the the physical and
mental feeling as a thing that's
elevating your cognitive abilities which
is what it's for you know part of the
reason you get stressed and you get that
fight ORF flight thing is because you
need to elevate your performance to
solve a problem
so you should look at the fact that you
have elevated performance rather than
look at that doesn't feel good now this
is one I also use you know my my own
take on this one which is slightly
different but gets to the same thing uh
I've told you never waste a bad day
never waste a bad day now what's a bad
day now in my context a bad day is
you're all stressed because something
happened so you're all stressed if
you're stressed anyway
you're elevated don't waste that I I
teach you the same thing I say if you're
going to fire
somebody do it on a day when everything
else went wrong
too because that is free you're not
going to get extra stress it'll just be
lost in the rounding so use your bad
days to do the bad
stuff and then you'll actually feel good
because you'll be like well it was a bad
day but at least I finished that one
thing I've been putting off
forever and I also tell you to exercise
when you when you're stressed because
stress gives you all this physical and
mental
ability so exercise it's the one thing
you can
control and it works really well if you
want to get a little extra exercise come
home stressed from work real easy to
exercise when you're stressed real easy
so use
it all right Stephen King
um he posted on X he said that notice
the right wiers want to ban abortions
and books but not semi
Autos so he thinks the right-wingers
want to ban abortions in books but not
semi-automatic
weapons which I said when your political
philosophy is nothing but a hoax that
would be the book ban uh plus a bad
analogy comparing uh gun ownership and
abortion that's just a bad analogy
uh I can guess your news
sources imagine being so
lost that your two main things you want
to mention on politics are one literally
a hoax the book Banning what what is
true is that conservatives want
Republicans uh want books that are not
appropriate for
children to be not available in a
library for children but still
available now I did see a few people
in my feed who said Scott I actually do
want to ban books I want to ban the
super Lefty Marxist you know books that
are hurting people to which I say no you
don't not
really you could get talked out of that
in about a minute here's me talking you
out of it just put it where adults can
see it like everything else you don't
want kids to see there there's a lot of
books that kids shouldn't see we do the
same same thing with all of them we put
them where they can't see them so no I
don't think there are really too many
Republicans who want to ban all books
from adults that doesn't seem like a
real thing to me although people did say
it was a real
thing so anyway let Stephen King being
Stephen
King um so I guess the stormmy Daniels
trial there are seven uh super good
Liars who got picked for the jury how
could you not be a liar and and be
picked for that
jury uh juror number six do you have any
bias about um ex-president
Trump
no no why would I why would I have bias
I I I don't even understand the question
really no no no no no
no if you put me in a
situation where I honestly believe
that Hitler was on trial and I could be
on the
jury I'm going to lie any way I have to
to be on that jury because it's my
responsibility to take out
Hiller the the idea that this would be
some kind of a fair trial is so
ludicrous do do the Democrats even in
their private moments think this is some
kind of a Justice that's happening
because I don't think so don't they know
what's happening
or or there some so dumb they think
Trump actually committed 91
crimes I think they know that it's just
an OP but maybe they're so dumb they
don't
know anyway the the fact that the venue
was not changed for Trump's
elections that basically if the Supreme
Court doesn't throw that stuff out I
don't know
what uh speaking of Tesla there're also
I guess they voted today to reinstate
Elon musk's $ 55.8 billion pay package
that the state of Delaware threw
out um now the reason that the it was
originally thrown out is that the judge
who threw it out said that Elon Musk had
too much control over his own
board so the judge said hey this board
is not operating independently enough so
it's not like they made their own
decision you know it's like you rammed
it down their
throat so in response to being uh
accused of having the board too much on
his side Elon Musk is um trying to put
his brother on the board
Kimble so U maybe that's not the best
timing not the best timing to uh get
your pay package reinstalled they had
been killed because you had too much
influence on the board and then at the
same time you're reinstalling that
asking them to put your brother on the
board um now it's not crazy because
Kimble actually was one of the early
investors in Tesla and Kimble actually
owns
a pretty healthy chunk of it so putting
somebody who is a you know a well tested
entrepreneur and friendly to the to uh
Elon and also has you know large
ownership in the company that's not
crazy so actually Kimble musk is
probably a good pick because he's a
serious person but it's kind of weird
timing that you do it at the same time
as that pay package but
anyway um more colleges are according to
Washington Times more colleges are
having what they call
Affinity commencements meaning that uh
it be an all black commencement or an
all all uh
philipin which I'm is the uh the word
the gender neutral term for
Filipinos so I'm pretty sure the oh it's
spelled with a p not a pH
pipic all right so I'm sure all the
Filipinos would be delighted to know
that they're pipic now I pipic it's even
got penis right in it for a general
neutral term it shouldn't be pipic this
should be pipic
vagina if you're going to be gender
neutral you might as well do it right no
pilip penix is just wrong there's too
much penix in there pilip penix vagina
no that's gender neutral no no wrong no
it should be pill of vagina penix
because you want the vagina to come
first otherwise you got trouble you got
trouble well um in other news um Jeffrey
tubin uh says that Justice Thomas is a
disgrace for minimizing the January 6
attack on the capital called the justice
of
disgrace you know what would happen if a
conservative had done what tubin did and
then had that
opinion they would call him a racist
masturbator well
if a conservative was Jeffrey T tubin
he'd be called a racist
masturbator but because he's a Democrat
he's described in this news article as a
legal Affairs
journalist a legal Affairs do you know
it would be a legal
Affair well if you had affair with
somebody's married
spouse you know arguably depending on
where you are that could be illegal
technically illegal depending on where
you are
but if you're uh just uh jerking off on
Zoom that's a legal
Affair that's completely legal so he's a
legal Affair
journalist whacking off on
Zoom all right um we're going to segue
from jacking off to jacking up your
economic numbers that's called a
segue so the IMF the international money
fund uh says that America's recent EC
economic performance is is quite
impressive so isn't that great to get a
international monetary body to
complement the performance of your
economy right when Biden is running for
president oh but there's a second part
of it uh it's partially the result of
the country's unsustainable fiscal
practices o that's bad unsustainable
fiscal practices well that's another way
to say that we're circling the
drain and it's creating a risk for
Global economies so in other words we
have too much
debt and the debt is what makes our
economy looks artificially
good um but it's
unsustainable so really we have a uh we
have an economy that's just perfectly
made for an election year to get the
incumbent elected hey look at this look
at this economy is better than all the
other
economies onless you look at the debt if
you look at our debt levels you can
plainly see that we're doomed and
there's nothing that can change it or as
Biden says the best economy in the
entire industrial World
doomed but at the moment good enough to
get us to the
election so there's that so the IMF
noticed that we doomed I don't know if
we're
doomed but I don't know how we can
handle the debt like I don't even
know Kimble musk is already on Test's
board yeah that's
weird so I guess uh I need some fact
checking on that story whether Kimble's
already in the
board all
right um I like Kimble because he's
doing he's working on indoor gardening I
think that's the
future um so how are these uh
how are those charges let's talk about
Justice gorset she's talking about the
uh the January 6 people not Trump but
the uh the people who attended the
protest and those cases are being
challenged and Gorsuch uh asked
questions about whether any of these
things would be called obstructing a
congressional proceeding because that's
what a lot of the people were charged
with on January 6 obstructing a official
proceeding so so he said would a sit in
at a trial be considered that because
that's what happened at the caban on
protest he said with pulling a fire
alarm when there's going to be a vote
which is what representative Bowman did
he said how about heckler's in the crowd
the Palestinian protesters and how about
the uh mostly peaceful protest from BLM
so basically he gave a a bunch of
cases that looked like they would would
be trivial pulling a fire alarm slight
delay you know we'll do it tomorrow
slight delay that sort of
thing well thank
you woman voice very nice of you anyway
um so it seems like at least the
conservative judges might be leaning
toward tossing out some of these
obstructing justice things now if if the
individuals are or let's say their cases
are thrown out the ones who were already
convicted if they get released because
the Supreme Court said no this is not
obstructing an official
proceeding then that's going to have a
big impact on what the Trump case looks
like don't what you think it's going to
be have a big impact
but what did we hear
today I just saw this before I got on
that uh in the Fulton County case the
fonnie Fon Willis thing so that's an
election interference case so there's a
judge that just threw out six of the
charges so these are charges that are
thrown out against Trump so the first
case was about just the protesters now
I've changed to talk about Trump in the
Fon County so it's a different
case um but the judge threw out
conspiracy to commit election fraud
criminal solicitation to commit election
fraud criminal attempt to commit
election fraud intentional interference
with performance of election duties
conspiracy to commit false statements
conspiracy to commit violation of Oath
by a public
officer what's
left what isn't that the whole case I
thought the Fon County one was about
Trump's phone call in which he was
asking them to find the votes
didn't the judge just throw out every
bit of
that I need I'll need to catch up on the
story but to me it looks like everything
that mattered just got thrown out so I
think you're going to have a case by
election day where every one of the law
fair cases against Trump has been
completely disgraced by the
courts now that'll be fun I wonder if
the Democrats will see what's happening
I think what they'll see is that rich
people can get away with crime
don't don't you think that's what the
the Democrats will say oh man if you're
s if you're rich enough you can commit
91 crimes and get away with it that's
actually what Pro probably Stephen King
will will be uh posting 91 crimes and he
got away with it our two-tier justice
system they're actually going to call it
a two-tier justice system you know
that's coming oh you know that's coming
yeah anyway
[Music]
um so there's a publication called the
conversation and they did an article
about uh spasmodic dysphonia that's the
voice problem that I had and also that
RFK Jr still
has and here's what they said they they
said there's no cure for that voice
condition there's no
cure for The Voice condition that I had
that made it impossible for me to do
what I'm doing right now in front of you
completely
cured right so imagine what it's like to
be me and read an article that the very
thing that I spent years getting cured
is
incurable now
imagine that there are another I don't
know 30 to 50,000 people like me and
they're going on to Google and they're
trying to find out how to how to solve
this problem and they come across this
article article and it says well there's
no cure but you know a lot of people use
botox so what are you going to do you're
going to go to your doctor and you can
to say I hear there's only one thing
that works it's called
Botox shot through my neck into my vocal
cords yeah so and then it said that uh
it's a brain condition and that it might
be caused by some kind of vaccination
damage
which would be
ironic um or it might be because of
measles or something so there's some
theory about something that happened to
you that would give it to
you um none of those really hold up
apparently it's just I think it's just
an overuse thing you overuse a muscle
that's how I got it I had just regular
uh regular flu or something and uh I
just tried to talk too hard through
laryngitis and that's actually how how
you get it you strain it too much now if
it's a brain
problem and if it's caused by a
vaccination which is the claim that I
don't think is
true how could you how could you solve
it by rewiring the nerves in a person's
neck because that's how it was solved
for me and the reason I got the surgery
is because I talked to people personally
who got the surgery and could talk
perfectly and I talked to other people
number of them who all had been cured
the same
way so if it's a brain problem how do
you cure it by rewiring the nerves in
the neck how does that work if it's a
brain problem it's like we don't know
anything about this because we don't
know why the surgery worked and even the
person who did the surgery I asked him
how how does that work he said wasn't
quite
sure but it did so I guess it'll be more
of it so but just think about this the
fact that something as important as
fixing a medical problem that for
anybody has it they're completely
suicidal do you know that by the way the
people who have this particular voice
problem the the rate of them that become
suicidal is really high and I can tell
you for sure you do
become suicidal I know I did because
your your quality of life is below the
level it's worth living honestly it was
below the level I found
worthwhile so I worked pretty hard to
get a cure so I didn't have to do it the
hard
way all right so I don't know what's
happening with this mayorcas uh
impeachment process I guess it made it
to the
Senate but I don't know if it's actively
being processed in the Senate is the
Senate actually taking it seriously or
they just sort of officially read it in
but it's not going to be handled does
anybody know because what I would like
to see is see this uh process tells us
who he is working
for in my opinion it's impossible to
explain
mayorcas unless he's working for someone
other than our
government do you have that same same
impression he looks like he's working
for somebody
else now I don't know
that I'm just saying that if I were to
observe it from space you know like an
alien and say all right what does the
country want you to do uh secure the
Border what is your job secure the
Border what are you spending every day
doing keeping the borderers super
unsecure how do you explain that how
could you possibly explain that unless
he's working for somebody else now I
assume it's the
cartels to me and by the way when he
testifies he looks like he's under
duress
just my take on it now no proof of
course we can't you know humans can't
read minds and but he acts like somebody
who's got a gun to his head and he has
to say the things he's saying he doesn't
look like a True
Believer he does not look like a True
Believer in the comments people are
saying he's
Jewish oh my
God let me say this again I like I'd
like to put this challenge out to all my
anti semetic viewers of which there are
way too
many find me any evidence for your
conspiracy theory that the Jews are
secret conspiracy to run the world find
me any evidence the only thing you have
is that people who are good at school
have lots of good jobs you're going to
have to think past
that the people who are good in school
have good jobs that's all you know
that's all you know if you know
something else and you'd like me to know
it show it to me show me the email where
they were colluding show me the uh The
Whistleblower says I got to tell you
it's a big old Jewish
conspiracy show me anything anything any
scrap of
anything and you believe you have it
right and and somehow I've never seen it
but you have it no what you have is an
old newspaper clipping
that won't pass any fact check probably
so anyway so I would appreciate if you
just stop pointing out that important
people who are good at school are also
Jewish I get it by the way do you think
I haven't noticed do you think I haven't
noticed there's a tremendous number of
successful Jewish people in America of
course I have do you think I haven't
noticed that they have an unusual
influence on the system especially
Israel related things of course I
have everybody has you don't need to say
it on every
stream on every
topic because we all know it and you're
not advancing any argument unless you
have something more than people who are
good at school get good jobs if you
can't take it beyond
that maybe check your behavior because
you're not helping
you're not informing you're not making a
point you're not doing
anything so do something do
something if if you think it's important
to make your case then do something make
the
case but don't just sit there going
during the live stream because you think
that makes a difference like like
nobody's noticed that Jewish people do
well do you think there's somebody who
hasn't noticed that you've got to bring
our attention to it every time
there's a topic every
time anyway um Tru social is uh going to
introduce a streaming service which is
interesting so they say they're going to
stream news networks and religious
channels along with content that has
been
canceled or is that risk of cancellation
well we'll see now that would put him in
competition with uh locals and Rumble
and some other things um and of course
you're going to wonder will there be any
kind of like combination at some point
you know any of these entities going to
merge maybe I don't know I don't think
truth social could merge with anything
at the moment because their value is so
pumped up from U you know because of
Trump's
involvement so that makes it hard for
them to merge with anybody but it's good
to see uh competition out there
China is um it looks like America
is working hard to diversify from China
so even Apple CEO says he's looking now
at Indonesia they've already moved some
of their stuff out of China so they're
moving some stuff to Vietnam and now
Indonesia looks good so so it does look
like you know the chip manufacturing is
coming back to the US or coming to it
for the first time from uh so it's not
all going to be in Taiwan which someday
will be all China but that's good good
good Trend well the
Soros um fund just puts $60 million into
the Democracy
pack have I mentioned today that the
name of a thing is always the opposite
of what it does imagine the guts to be
the Soros
foundation and put $60 million into
basically being the biggest Doner to the
Democrats and calling that
democracy what what could be more
opposite than of democracy than a
billionaire putting $60 million into one
side that is literally the opposite of
democracy I mean in it is certainly
legal but in in Impact in effect how in
the world do you sell that as
democracy but the the idea that the
title the thing is always the opposite
of the thing it's very consistent and
there it
is and by the way I think that uh Soros
is really just a banker for the Atlantic
Group which is a front for the CIA
people and the intelligence people who
run the country so I see Soros as just
the banker for the Atlantic
group that's what it looks like to me
now do you remember uh wasn't too long
ago I kept having live streams where he
said Can somebody explain the George
Soros thing like how in the world does
any of it make sense but it does make
sense once you realize it's our own
intelligence people um and they're using
them as their Bank everything makes
sense when when you understand he's
working he he's working for the bad guys
on our team he's working for our own bad
guys so that makes sense now and again I
don't have proof of any of that
it's just
obvious I'd say it's obvious that he you
know he's got a connection with the
Atlantic group and it's pretty obvious
at this
point all right um The Daily skeptic
tells us a story about three
billionaires who are behind what some
would call the climate change hoax the
three people in
2012 three wealthy men they say um so it
was uh Bloomberg billionaire Bloomberg
hedge fund manager Tom Styer and former
CEO of Goldman Sachs Hank pson so they
each put in half a million dollars to a
fund to try to get you more scared about
climate change so three billionaires
decided that you should be much more
frightened about climate change now
which of these three billionaires is the
climate
scientists is uh Tom Styer a climate
scientist I think he was a hedge fund
guy how about uh Bloomberg is Bloomberg
a
scientist no seems more like an
entrepreneur type of guy um how about uh
uh Hank pulson scientists no no where
did they get their information then if
they're not
scientists they were told by
experts and they believed the experts so
I believe three idiots who fell for the
biggest hoax in human history um largely
almost destroyed the
country by being
absolute uh idiots and being totally
sucked in by this this
hoax well um Roger ail who writes about
this a lot um climate change
Etc uh he's the author of uh oh there
the these guys the three billionaires
were the authors of risky business that
was a report that took the most the most
extreme climate change fear and tried to
sell it as the most
likely so instead of taking the most
likely which wouldn't have gotten people
afraid enough they took the scariest
level and they tried to sell it to you
as the most likely which would be very
frightening it's also not likely but
they didn't tell you that
part so there's another case where some
billionaires are ruining the world like
George Soros
there there's that um I saw a story that
uh China had not done anything to
criminalize
Fentanyl and uh and the US was you know
mad about
that and also that apparently China is
incentivizing the fentanyl precursor
production so apparently they're tax
breaks for making fentel precursors to
sent to the cels so not only are they
not putting in jail or making illegal
the fenel precursors they're encouraging
it with tax
breaks now I remember when I would be
really really mad at this because I
thought to myself oh how can America let
this other country our rival country
kill so many Americans with fenel why
don't they do
more and then eventually you realize
that uh China and the cartels are
working together with apparently our
intelligence people because there's also
no explanation for the lack of progress
on fenel unless it's coming from inside
the house meaning unless our CIA or some
intelligence entity uh wants it to
happen that's the only way it could
happen the the the only way you could
see no real progress just none none not
not anything the only way you could see
that is if it were in favor of it at
some entity level within the United
States so that's my working assumption
is that the CIA needs to control other
countries in this hemisphere they always
have um and the way they do it is
through the cartels and they have a
productive
Arrangement which costs America 50,000
lives a
year uh and the benefit for that is we
get to control these other
countries and that that's a conscious
decision so to me it looks like a
conscious decision now do we live in a
world where people would do something
that horrible where there would be
massive loss of
life just to accomplish some goal yeah
that's what Ukraine is that's all
Ukraine is it's a giant op for people
who like to launder money and launder
CIA operations and uh and uh sell NATO
weapons to a country that didn't need
with NATO weapons until it looked like
it was going to become NATO to stealing
the energy from uh Russia yeah we we do
live in a world where
routinely people will sacrifice tens of
thousands if not millions of their own
citizens for a profit yeah there's no
doubt about
it as Mike Ben spoke on this the cartel
connection um yes
and I I'll refer you to
him for his take on
that
um yeah and by the way I'm I'm informed
by
his his models of the world are
informing me on
this
um I just explained Co maybe you know
the thing I don't believe about
is that the other schemes are clearly
good for the
schemers um and bad for other people so
that makes sense I'm going to start a
war but I'm not going to personally be
in the war I'll just make money for it
so it's your problem not mine I'll make
money you'll have problems that's what I
want but if you're convincing me that
somebody intentionally created a
pandemic for their own profit I would
say that would cause me to think that
they're not acting rationally it's not
impossible but it wouldn't be a rational
thing to do you you wouldn't destroy
your own
country and that's the pandemic
destroyed everybody's life for like two
years I don't think you would do that
for money because you're in the country
if if you you would definitely destroy
somebody else's country for money but
destroying your own country for money
now the Sentinel situation is not case
of destroying the country for
money if if in fact our intell people
are allowing it to happen there there
would be treating it like a war there
would be 50,000 casualties but we would
have control over the hemisphere and
they might think that's an acceptable
expense so that's not really that's not
really the
same all right ladies and gentlemen that
is all I have in my prepared comments
I'm going to say bye to the platforms of
YouTube
and X thanks for joining sorry about
that little Technical hairup and I'm
going to hang with the uh people on

rest of you but we'll see you tomorrow
