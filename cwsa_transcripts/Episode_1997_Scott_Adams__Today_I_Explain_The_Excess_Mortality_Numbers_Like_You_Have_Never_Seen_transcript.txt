good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
there's never been a finer experience in
your entire life and if you'd like to
experience this at the peak possible
pinnacle
I just ran out of things to say at the
end of the sentence well all you need is
a copper mugger a glass of tanker
Chelsea Stein I can't teach yoga flask a
vessel of any kind filling with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
and because of my shirt it's the
zelenski
sip go
Matt Matt just made it everybody Matt's
here we're gonna start all over
Matt it's a good thing you made it
no we're not going to start all over
or are we
well
what's going on today let me tell you
here's how you know
it's a slow news day
a lot of people are talking about George
Santos
you know George Santos is a republican
but he may have told some Whoppers about
his resume Maybe
but the funniest part about it is that
he's a gay Republican
and the Republicans are you know totally
protecting him because you know like
Republicans but everything about this
story is just funny
but it doesn't really matter
is it really a big story that a liar got
into Congress
oh no
how will the Republic survive that one
liar in Congress if only they could get
rid of George Santos
and have a non-lying congress hey
wouldn't that be something
yeah let's get rid of that one liar
I think if we do that we'll be in good
shape well here's my macro observation
does it seem to you like the news got
suddenly really slow
am I right
like all the news is just yesterday's
news repackaged a little bit
there's something coming
there's something really big
coming and I don't know what it is I
don't have a guess probably political
but
there's no way that we're going to have
you know another week of no news
that we're not going to have a full week
of no news
and everything is just a repeat
like you know oh the uh the government's
going to be shut down
because of the debt ceiling
how many times have we done the same
story is it every year
and then who will blink first and who's
winning the shutdown and everybody hates
everybody because of the shutdown and
then once the shutdown happens what does
everybody say let's do the entire NPC
gamut okay
the NPCs the non-player characters if
we're a simulation are the ones who say
only the most obvious thing
all right so let's I'll give you a topic
and then you tell me what the NPCs say
and we'll play along at the same time
all right the most obvious thing to say
about another battle over the debt limit
oh why don't we have a line item veto
why don't we have a balanced budget
required
why don't we cut the uh the pay of the
members of Congress and then of course
my favorite the government shutdown I
didn't even notice maybe it's an
improvement maybe we should shut the
rest of it down
and then of course we have to talk about
who won and who blinked and who lost
no nobody's winning nobody's losing
they're all just playing the same game
how does anybody win it lose I don't
know we're just going to get bored by
the whole thing they're gonna
pass some continuing resolution or
something we don't understand that
they're going to keep spending our money
but not much of a story there but here's
an interesting thing I saw on Twitter
today
in a Twitter account by dumasani
Washington who says over two million I
think there was an article on the hill
yeah the hill
um over two million students have left
Public School in the last two years and
many are now homeschooled including over
16 percent of black households which is
the largest percentage of any ethnic
group
did any of you know that did you know
that the uh the black uh American kids
are going to home school at a higher
rate than others
what a great trend
now that should be like the headline
shouldn't it is there anything happening
right now that would be like new you
know that we haven't already talked to
death but also could be like a wonderful
thing
so here's here's my argument why uh
helping the young black population of
America
is the biggest lever we have for
improving the country because they're in
the deepest hole right if you help the
people who are in the deepest hole you
can maybe move them from you know
depending on the system to making money
and supporting the system and it's a way
better benefit if you take somebody from
you know costing money to making money
as opposed to taking somebody who's
already making money and you know they
do 20 better that's a much smaller gain
for society than helping somebody go
from unemployed to employed that's a
that's a big thing
so
it looks like the you know maybe the
free market and maybe
some other forces are causing a trend
that would be very beneficial for black
Americans and that would be amazing for
everybody in America
so how about that just unambiguous good
news
does that feel good just unambiguous
good news black Americans are taking up
homeschooling at higher rates than other
people good
and so that's that's exactly what I want
to say in America
so maybe more of that let's see that
um
the Rasmussen did some polling about
this debt ceiling and the shutdown stuff
56 percent prefer the shutdown
so that that's how Congress is doing
56 percent of us would rather just close
the entire stuff just just close it all
down
ah forget it but I think people like the
fight they just don't know what to do
about it
it's just not easy to to fix the problem
because we have a system problem it's
not really a person problem is it
wouldn't you agree it's a system design
problem that gets us to the same place
all the time you could replace all the
people in it
you know you could do term limits get
rid of everybody tomorrow but then it
would just quickly re-evolve back to
where it is
so we do need
a system change I don't think it's a
Personnel change I think it's got to be
a system change so if you saw a person
who had any influence who said I
recommend a different process except for
the line item veto that's never going to
happen you know we could talk about it
all day I guess
but we need if somebody's saying do
something differently
I would I would certainly listen to that
but if everybody is just oh do it our
way do it our way pass this bill don't
pass this bill it's all just nothing
yeah and again
uh yeah we'll do we'll we'll talk about
that story don't worry
uh
every day I find myself waking up being
a little bit amazed
that Matt Gates has renewed himself
politically
is anybody is surprised at that as I am
I've never seen anything like that like
the the rapidity of which he went from
you know politically dead to maybe the
only person in the on the Republican
side you care about lately he's the only
one who did anything good lately
Carpe can we shut down the government
indefinitely and salt the Earth see it's
very popular we want them to fail even
though we don't really
so maybe Gates is the only kind of
person who could you know maybe suggest
something that's out of the box because
everybody else seems to be in the Box
like the most dangerous person in the
world
in Congress like mansion and Cinema
because they have the ability to get out
of their box and now Matt Gates
they're basically three people who could
run Congress because everybody else
decided not to
the three who took leadership because
they could and apparently they want to
be leaders
they actually want to do it and so they
are three most three most important
people in Congress
um although I think Thomas Massey is a
is a sleeper yo are you all watching him
because he sort of quietly
stays rational and consistent
which always makes them sort of an
outcast in the the bigger conversations
like whoever is being trying to just be
rational
gets really ignored because they don't
they don't create a lot of energy
but but there's like a if here's
something to keep an eye on it's he's a
sleeper
because he just continues to be
smart and right
like every day
well that wasn't very interesting but he
was smart and he was right
and then tomorrow okay a new topic well
there's that
smart guy being right again you know
didn't get a lot of attention
but there he is smart and right but once
again
so
you know here's my long-range prediction
he might be and I hate to use this term
because don't make too much of the
analogy he might be the Bernie Sanders
of the Republicans
meaning that you know Bernie was like a
weirdo until his time came and then he
was you know the star
I think Massey's you know like in this
odd little category of trying to be
rational and helpful and like nobody
even knows what that looks like it was
this rational helpful guy why does he
keep saying rational helpful things
that's no good but I feel like his time
will come
if he stays in that job I don't know if
he will
so I think things are going to catch up
with him he doesn't need to catch up
with them all right better so let's see
who's uh
uh 21 of according to Rasmussen 21 of
the uh people polled think taxpayers are
more to blame for the size of the
deficit than Congress
21 think it's taxpayers problem not
Congress
that's a little low I would have
expected at least four basis points on
that I would have expected 25. that's
just me you know all right um in case
you wondered if we lived in a simulation
um we keep seeing little hints little
hints and yesterday there's a tragic
story of
a Fox News weatherman who was riding the
subway and he saw some teens
picking out an elderly guy and he got
involved so we like that right he he he
took uh
took initiative and tried to stop an old
man from being abused on the subway this
caused the teams to turn on him and beat
him quite badly
so he got the crap beat out of him on
the on the subway he was outnumbered now
uh the name of this weatherman this Fox
News weather man is uh Adam his first
name is Adam
his last name is klotz
k-l-o-t-z
so um I believe I believe there was some
bleeding involved but the good news is
Adam klotz
so he's fine he's fine because Adam
clouds
but
why is he in the news at the same time I
am
foreign
like what are the odds what are the odds
that he would be like a national story
at the same time you know people are all
riled up about my recent vaccination
statements
which are not really vaccinations
are they
we'll talk about that
how many of you saw on Twitter a uh
tweet and a video of a woman who claims
that she got the vaccination and it gave
her like some kind of permanent shakes
and she was trying to walk and she was
she was shaking badly how many of you
saw that
so uh yeah I was going all over the
Internet and
uh
of course because it's the internet and
nobody holds back on Twitter
people were brutal saying that she was
faking
the the number of people who said this
is a fake video You're faking and uh to
the point
to the point where Twitter actually put
a context warning on it saying there's
no evidence that this really happened
apparently somebody checked in whatever
state or location allegedly this
happened and there was no report of it
but who knows so I don't I don't believe
the context and I don't believe the
video
but here we are
we're at a point where nothing's
believable
just nothing
so when I saw the video I didn't think
it was true or false I just sort of
ignored it but it became a big story
so I guess I'm past believing things are
true because they're on video
how many of you immediately think of
video is real
and how many of you automatically say
hmm probably not
even if it's a video
I'm kind of getting to the point where
any video looks fake to me like as my
default
speaking of fake videos
you know the famous picture of uh Prince
uh who is he Andrew
uh
the one who was
photographed
hugging Virginia Jeffrey or whoever she
was the Epstein
the young Epstein girl slash woman
and apparently uh
Maxwell is saying from jail allegedly
that she believes that photo was
photoshopped
and that she has no memory of those two
ever being together now she's not
denying you know the the general scheme
of things so she's not she's not saying
that that those two weren't part of
their operation she's saying that
um that the photo is not real
but that the two people were actually
part of it so if she were denying that
the two people were even there
then I'd say oh okay that's I mean
that's a lot I'm not sure I would buy
that but she's accepting that they were
both there
and but maybe at different times and she
thinks it was a fake photo
now apparently some experts think so too
there's no original
nobody's ever seen the original
and some some people who know how to
spot fakes think it actually looks fake
now I looked at it today
and you can see that you know there's a
hand around her waist I'm looking at the
hand and I thought to myself
you know I could actually see that as
fake
yeah I think she was she was allegedly
17 in the photo
so so what do you call a 17 year old is
she a girl or a woman
what's the standard on that obviously
legally she's not of age but a young
woman let's go with the young woman
yeah a young young woman is better right
young woman yeah girl just seems
too dismissive
all right
um
so the biggest news yesterday
it turned out to be me
um so I just had the weirdest experience
the last day or so
now you're probably aware that I
declared that the unvaccinated
uh the uncovered vaccinated are are the
winners of the pandemic
that they got the right answer because
if I had gotten to this point where you
know Omicron is even decreasing
and and if I could be unvaccinated I
would have one less thing to worry about
right
so compared to how I played it
I got to the end of the pandemic but I
have something in me that I don't know
if there could be any long-term
implications
if you got to the end of the pandemic
and you have nothing unusual in you and
you also are alive
I conclude that you were the smartest
ones
Fair
and but here here's the interesting
thing that happened and I I totally
didn't see this coming
people people showed me so much love in
the last day and a half
I've never seen anything like it
now you you know maybe you're unaware of
it because most of it came in like DMS
and privately and stuff but
I I didn't know what would happen
you know I wasn't sure what happened
when I said that publicly but it turns
out it was all positive
there were there were a few people who
you know like were a little niggling
about you know why didn't I get there
faster or what took me so long but
basically everybody was happy
that I'd you know made that shift in
public opinion
but what is weird is that I didn't get
any pushback from what you might call
pro-vaccination people
not
is that weird
not a single I didn't see an article
to criticize me nothing
yeah now Eric Alex birdson had some
snipey words but he was happy that what
I said
so so even even you know somebody you
expect to be your biggest critic was
like happy at least where I ended up on
it now here was the interesting thing a
number of you said
uh both publicly and privately to me
that it must have been really
embarrassing for me to
to do what I did to say that the unvaxed
are the winners
and other people said it must have been
a difficult day for me must have been
really hard
for me to say that
other people said you know I must have
must have been tough for my ego
and others wondering you know what it
was like for me to be eat and grow
did anybody think I had a hard day for
the last day and a half
how many thought I was having a hard day
I was having a great day
I had nothing but compliments all day
now the other thing is people wondered
how hard it was
for me to make the decision like did I
agonize about it
let me tell you honestly God this is
this is a completely true
I didn't think about it much
I think I thought of it all in five
minutes I thought oh you know things
have changed now we know more you know
we're you know things keep revealing
themselves in small bits and we seem to
be at sort of the end of the pandemic
and I was just sitting there at one
moment I thought oh okay time to revise
my
revise my uh you know current uh
understanding of things
it took no it took no work at all I had
no friction
do you believe that
because I think you're putting
yourselves in my seat and you're saying
this would have been hard for me it
wasn't hard at all
there was no friction and do you know
why there was no friction
do you know why do you know why it was
so easy and it was only a good day
it was easy because I was never
contradicting myself
I've always said that as as information
becomes available I will reassess my
beliefs and I've always said that on
anything on anything that if I'm wrong
I'd like to be wrong in public
because what I primarily what I do is
talk about how to how to analyze the
news and who's getting the right answer
and how they did it and you know what
was your analytical process and why did
it beat this analytical process so if I
if I analyze something wrong
and then tell you about it that's just
what I do
like I don't have I had no obstacle I
had literally no obstacle to changing my
mind in public
because that's that's the environment I
had created so I didn't have any any
risk
but it's interesting that how many of
you thought
that it would be daring and brave
to change my mind about something in
public
it's easy
it's real easy now the other superpower
I have which I talk about a lot in fact
my upcoming book I talked about this
quite a bit if you can learn to be free
of embarrassment
it's like a freaking superpower
because you know today like my Twitter
followers are way up my my traffic here
is up everybody complimented me
yesterday but what I did was something
that most of you would have considered
and terribly embarrassing
but it wasn't to me
I really didn't care like it never
occurred to me
honestly it never even occurred to me
that I could be embarrassed never even
thought of it well it wasn't part of any
of the variables at all it's just not
part of my life anymore
and if you can get to the point where
you can
reframe embarrassment out of your life
it really is a superpower you can just
do more stuff
just do more stuff
um
all right
so
yeah Jake Shields said it couldn't have
been it must not have been an easy thing
to do but Jake it was really easy
it was so easy
totally easy
all right but here are some things that
uh
I learned from the people who got all
the right answers
would you like me to spend some more
time telling you how wrong I was and how
right
my critics were you like that right
all right so here's some more
um so yesterday I think I I suggested
that uh everybody was operating
by guessing
you know so I said in the early days
basically nobody could tell what was
real and what wasn't real but I was
corrected
so there were a number of people who did
not get vaccinated and they said it's
not guessing and it's not a heuristic
it's not it's not just that we didn't
trust the government
is that we did a deep dive and we did
our research and the research clearly
showed don't do this
and so since those are the people who
got the right answer I decided to look
at what some of them said
um for example Chris
Martinson who's a PhD he got the right
answer and here's how he describes it he
goes I use the science data and
deduction to arrive at my own
conclusions now I thought I was doing
those things
but apparently I wasn't but here's how
to do it right I never took the vaccine
because I couldn't resolve one major
question and the question was why did
every vaccine manufacturer use the quote
Whole Spike protein construct
that's very weird
okay so I missed that
did you did you all uh catch that
because they used the whole Spike
protein
a lot of you probably were thinking well
it's probably just some of the spike
protein or a little bit
but somehow I completely missed that I
think it's my lack of scientific
training that I didn't realize the whole
Spike protein would be the mistake
so
um and here's another one
I hope I write it down
uh yeah there was at least one other one
that I wanted to note
um
oh here's one
uh from Kevin mckernan also on Twitter
this is someone else who got the right
answer
and by doing research so listen to this
so here's something else I missed a very
quick glance at the sequence of the
vaccines demonstrated enrichment of
quadruplex G's the letter g
quadruplex g is that didn't exist in the
virus this is data you chose meaning me
that I chose to ignore
that is correct
I completely ignored and I hope none of
you did this but I ignored the
enrichment of quadruplex genes
and I completely missed that they use
the entire Spike protein
so that's you know maybe a
probably a blind spot I have because my
lack of scientific training so I won't
make that mistake again but the
interesting thing is that the smartest
people are the people I think the part
we all agree on is that the smartest
people
are the ones who don't have this you
know chemical in them the vaccination at
this point because the pandemic is
winding down
they would be the smartest but have you
ever have you ever thought who would be
the second smartest
if we can all agree who got the right
answer
it's those of you who are still here and
um don't have a vaccination in you
so-called vaccination
but who is the second smartest group
I think it's the here's what I used to
think and here I was wrong again
I've been wrong about a lot of things so
here's where I was wrong in I thought
the second smartest people
would be the people who use the same
reasoning as the people who didn't get
vaccinated
some some because they did a deep dive
others because they're heuristics of hey
why do they have so much legal
protection and why don't they give us
more data and why did they rush it so
those people you know also got the right
answer but I think the
second smartest people
were the ones who avoided the
vaccination
and then died of covet
so the second smartest I thought were
the dead people
because they used the same reasoning as
the people who are alive and they're the
smartest people so you know if they all
had the same smart reasoning
the second smartest ones are the one who
died
but
here's where I was wrong
I found out yesterday on Spaces
that there are a lot of people and I
believe it or not I didn't know this
until yesterday I swear to God I didn't
know this till yesterday
but a lot of people believe the pandemic
never happened
like actually didn't happen
as in nobody died of covet
as in actually nobody died of covet as
in zero people died of covert it never
happened
and I didn't know that was a real belief
I actually honestly God I did not know
anybody thought that
but I did a little survey on Twitter and
um you know of course it's unscientific
so I said Do You Believe coven shots
protected any category of people and
here I was looking for I think we mostly
agree that young people have more costs
than benefit from vaccinations
that's that's sort of the current
thinking among the public anyway
and but I thought that the public
believed that at least old people
got some protection from hospitalization
to death
but I asked on Twitter and 53 percent
said nobody got any benefit from the
shots
and and they don't mean
they don't mean that the side effects
are worse than the protection they mean
that nobody was protected in any way
even even temporarily
uh so 23 percent
said yes the shots gave somebody some
protection
24 said maybe and 53 percent said no
so if the people who follow me more than
half
believe the entire pandemic was fake
and then nobody died of covet
interesting
um
so I would like to
support that point of view
with my own hypothesis
how could it be
how could it possibly be that we would
have excess deaths because we seem to
if there was no pandemic well some
people are saying it's the vaccinations
themselves
and I I don't know one way or the other
so I'm not going to weigh in on whether
or not it's the vaccination
because I've been wrong about everything
so far would you agree
as wrong as I've been about everything
so far
if I don't have any data one way or
another I'm not going to say it's is or
is not the vaccinations but would you
agree that that hypothesis uh exists as
a possibility
it exists right it is a rule now is it
there's any there's no way to rule out
because I don't think it's been studied
to death right but I'm going to give you
another interpretation
which you have not heard
in which all of the excess deaths could
be explained
without covid and without the
vaccination do you think I can do that
and not only that but I'm going to give
you a vaccine an explanation that's way
more uh probable
way more
way more probable than either covid or
vaccination injury or the two of them
added together
all right well that is my challenge
and I shall do it right now you've heard
of the placebo effect of course you know
that if you're testing any kind of drug
that as many as 30 to 60 percent of the
people who get the fake drug that
doesn't do anything 30 to 60 percent of
them
actually have a benefit
with no drug
now do you know how science explains how
that's possible
do you know what the scientific
mechanism is that somebody will believe
something might work and that it
actually works in the real in their
actual body
do you know how the placebo works
scientifically do you know the
explanation
nobody does
no
belief is a fact
but how the belief trans translates into
a physical response is unknown
now have you ever heard of a nocebo
is the same concept as a placebo
but instead of believing that the let's
say the pill is good for you if you
believe it might be bad for you it can
actually hurt you
you could actually injure yourself
by belief that the pill will injure you
when it's just a nothing pill
that's a real thing so the placebo is
where you get a fake benefit even though
nothing in the real world should make
that happen and then nocebo is where it
hurts you even though that drug couldn't
hurt anybody
and I let me say again
science has no idea why
no idea
I know why
or I know what the most likely
explanation of Y is
we live in the simulation
and people and not everybody but
something like 30 to 60 percent of
participants or players
the NPCs
just do whatever the pill does
but the players are actually creating
the reality and then walking into it the
reality they've created
now what are the odds that we live in a
simulation well I don't want to recap
that but if you listen to Elon Musk or
you listen to me
you'll know that the odds that we are a
simulation and not an original species
probably a trillion to one or a billion
to one
so if the odds of us being a simulation
are you know a billion to one because
there will be lots of simulations for
every original world that makes
simulations
so while we could be real it's possible
the the odds are just astronomically
against it
if we were a simulation could you
explain placebos and nocebos
yes you could
in the context of a simulation that
makes perfect sense
because it also explains affirmations
positive thinking
and why people who believe they live in
the simulation keep getting better
results
I tell you I believe I live in that
honestly I believe this is a simulation
that's my actual opinion
but my life keeps turning out like it
could only be a simulation my actual
life is so unusual it couldn't possibly
just be organically happening it just
doesn't seem possible and Elon Musk same
thing he believes it's a simulation
there's nothing about his life that
looks ordinary it looks like he's just
creating reality out of his mind and
we're we're watching him do it
so
here's my uh here's my
connecting it all together did you see a
um I forget where I saw it I think it
was erasmussen I think Rasmussen had the
poll
they said that
um
Republicans were more likely to believe
they knew somebody who had been injured
by the the shots
then Democrats do you believe that's
true
do you believe that if you asked the
Republicans would say yes more likely
not everyone but more likely they would
say yes I know somebody was injured by
the vaccination if yes the Democrats
they say no but I know somebody who's
got a long coveted
right Democrats are going to believe
long covid
Republicans are more likely to believe
vax injury
if we live in the simulation
they're both right
they both can be right it can happen at
the same time as long as the two stories
never have to be resolved and so far
they don't so far you can you can live
and procreate and go through your life
believing that no pandemic even happened
but it was all fake where you could go
through your life thinking it was a
deadly pandemic and people died like
crazy
and you can live right next to each
other
you can have jobs you can even marry
each other
and it would all work you just you just
have to have kids and then Society goes
up
so it doesn't need to be resolved and
the only way I can explain these
different worlds that we seem to be
experiencing is that we are a simulation
and the people who expected vacc injury
talk themselves into it and created it
the people who expected Lauren covet
talk themselves into it and created it
as a reality
the people who believe that no pandemic
happened lived in that reality
just happy as happy as by
the who or what is in control of the
simulation would be whoever created it
but they probably did a hands-off kind
of thing so they could see how it see
how it plays out
so it's probably not Hands-On except for
you know tweaking it or adding themes or
stuff
yeah who created the Creator we don't
have to answer that yet
but
um
if if it's true let me see if I can just
back up now and see how much I can get
you to say yes to
do you agree that the placebo and the
nocebo effect are so well demonstrated
that they're real like there's something
going on there you'd all agree with that
right
and what do you agree that science
doesn't know what it is and they've
looked at it a lot
right it's like one of the greatest
Mysteries it appears
and I'll just say appears that the
people are are simply changing the
reality based on their belief of the
pill
that's what it looks like to me it
doesn't look like only their belief has
changed it looks like their actual
reality changed
that's what it looks like to me it
doesn't look like the brain magically
produced chemistry that makes you
healthy
I think it could do that but I don't
think that's what happened because I
think science would find that right if
the mechanism had been your brain
changes your body chemistry
we would see that that would probably be
easy to spot but they can't find any
mechanism there's no mechanism
who were simulation we have to be
and you should look for this effect
everywhere
everywhere people expect something to
happen watch How often that happens
let me tell you something I expect
you'll see you can see if it happens the
the book that I'm just editing and
finishing up now it'll come out around
September
I've never made this prediction before
because it's a belief that's more of a
belief I think this could be the most
important book in the world
and not counting religious books right
we'll give the Bible and the Quran their
their own place but of Just Books
I actually think it's going to be the
most important book ever written because
it's it's nothing less than
reprogramming it's like a software
upgrade for a human
it's actually written
you know and I'm ahead in the test so I
can figure out how to do this stuff is
written like a software update to just
update everything about your social life
your sense of success your health just
an update
it's gonna it's gonna actually make the
world spin now let's see if that happens
so the reason I'm doing this is to give
you a little uh I don't know a little
Easter egg or something where you could
say okay he did say that thing which is
really really unusual
think about on how how unlikely that is
because my last books you know did not
change the world well one of them did I
guess one of them didn't change the
world but
uh so just track it track it because I
believe I can make that happen because
my brain thinks it's going to happen
and I haven't said that about my other
books there's this one's special
in a way that'll just blow your freaking
head off I think
pretty sure so we'll see
all right so I think excess deaths could
be explained by the following things
number one
um drug overdoses are way up
right
and Drug overdoses are way up which
probably means drugs are way up which
probably means that that explains why
they're more car accidents and every
other kind of accident
so every kind of accident is up
because drugs are up
um I would also say that people were out
of practice and commuting
wouldn't you the the people who didn't
commute for two years and then had to
commute were suddenly out of practice
I think that actually makes a difference
because I could feel it like if I don't
drive for a few weeks you feel Rusty you
should be like everything else if you
don't do it for a while you don't do it
as well
so let's say you've got drug overdoses
you've got car accidents that could be
you know lack of practice plus more
drugs
um
and we found that uh
uh let's see what
uh the homicide rate
among I read this today among young
black men
um was nearly 10 times higher than the
uh overall firearm death rate in the U.S
in 2021. and
so some of it
is murder
violence is up so I think murder is the
number one cause of young people
of death and fentanyl's got to be up
there so everything that kills young
people is way up and then
um even even the people who make the
so-called vaccinations
are saying that they do have side
effects right so even if the
vaccinations were just as safe as the
companies make them want want you to
believe even they say they kill people
and we we did a massive vaccination so
even if they're as safe as they say it
would still be excess deaths
um
all right so if you add all those things
together and then did you know that
after a major stress
like a pandemic or a war or something
did you know that heart attacks always
go up
did you know that after any big
stressful you know Global event
there's going to be a few years after
where heart attacks Spike
so we're seeing that and it's exactly
what you'd expect
so you should see more heart attacks now
did you know that you can be stressed to
the point of having heart problems
did you know that did you know you that
just stress just ordinary stress
could give you a heart problem
yeah
so have we ever had more stress
that's that's a known right don't we
know for sure that anxiety and stress
are at an all-time high right so your
your hypertension is high your cortisol
uh levels are through the roof
some of his social media some of it's
the pandemic itself some of it is fear
of the vaccination you took some of it
is fear of the covid you didn't gather
or did get right so in terms of fear is
through the roof
fear alone could explain the entire
excess
deaths
I'm not saying it does I'm saying that
the ex if you're looking at the size of
it it can explain all of it
did you know that
it can explain all of it I'm not saying
it is the explanation I'm saying it's
big enough do you know what else is big
enough to explain all of it all of the
excess deaths the placebo nocebo effect
it's big enough
explain all of it I'm not saying it is
right because that would be going too
far I'm saying that there are a whole
bunch of explanations for excess death
and they're all really good
one of them could be the vaccination
itself
one could be there's more coveted deaths
than we know you know bad counting
apparently we know that in Great Britain
that all the coveted data is useless
did you know that that's the the newest
information is that the covenated from
England or Great Britain I'm not sure
where they sliced it but they now
conclude it's all it's all just useless
it can't be used for any analysis
has no analytical abilities that
inaccurate
so
so you got that all right so you got
your isolation your your stress that
would cause your heart attacks your
fentanyl overdoses your extra murders
your extra accidents wouldn't it be a
miracle if there were no excess deaths
yeah even even the died suddenlies can
be heart attacks from just too much
stress and things building up could be a
lot of things
well you might be coming in uh late to
Swedish psychopath because the context
here is how I was wrong about everything
wrong about everything
all right so probably wrong about that
too
um
here's a question Dr Eli David said on
Twitter today that some got the vaccine
the covert vaccine uh because based on
trusting the evidence and then he listed
Elon Musk and me
so Dr Eli Davis thinks that I got the
covert vaccination based on trusting the
evidence
let me give a clarification
my problem wasn't trusting
big companies I'm the Dilbert guy
I'm literally the most famous person in
the world
for distrusting things that big
companies say
name anybody on the planet Earth
who is more famous or has a longer track
record of distrust of Corporations
nobody I'm number one in the world
Alex Jones okay Alex Jones number two
all right but uh here's here's uh
clarification I didn't trust the
vaccinations which is why I waited so
long I waited as long as I could
and I also predicted they wouldn't work
in the beginning so I didn't trust the
vaccinations but here's what Dr Eli
David may have missed
that I also didn't trust the people who
didn't trust them in other words there
were doctors who were saying the it's
obvious already you know that this is a
problem
so I didn't trust the experts but I
doubly didn't trust or equally didn't
trust I guess the the critics
so I was my problem was too much
distrust
not too little
you see that right so I said I can't
trust the vaccination and I can't trust
the people who say not to take it I
can't use any of that information so the
only information I used was I had to
travel internationally so I had to get a
shot it's the only information I used
I didn't have any other information I
trusted
so I didn't use it because it wasn't
credible either the critics or now
here's what I got wrong and I know you
like me to admit when I'm wrong so wrong
there are people
who are better than me in every possible
way who could tell
who was right and who was wrong
by looking at the arguments
so the people who did their deeper dive
looked at you know both arguments and
looked at their data and said all right
we trust these the critics
now
here's a question I have that I would uh
the same question I have for finance
you know there there are 10 or 20 000
stocks you could buy in the United
States I forget the number ten thousand
that you care about probably
so about 10 000 stocks you could pick
how does an individual know which ones
to pick
well most people get an expert they'll
get like a financial advisor or somebody
to help them invest if they have
investable funds
and then my second question is how many
advisors are there
so there are 10 000 stocks
but how many people are there that
advise you to buy them more than ten
thousand more than ten thousand
so you're going from trying to guess
which of ten thousand stocks and you
don't know any way to pick them you
transfer that to trying to pick one of
20 000 advisors and not knowing anything
about them
because their track record doesn't mean
anything it's not predictive everybody
knows that right it doesn't matter if
you had the best record for the last
five years nobody believes that predicts
because somebody was gonna just by luck
have the best one so if you if you
change your
um if you change your point of view from
which stock do I buy and you have no
idea
to which advisor to I ask to buy which
stock is just another thing you don't
have anything any idea about
you haven't upgraded your analysis
you've actually paid extra money
to Simply double your confusion because
now you don't know if you got a good
advisor and you also don't know what
stocks to buy
if you don't get the advisor you don't
pay the extra money
but you're still just guessing
so what do I do
I don't get an advisor that would be
crazy
but other people do because they unlike
me
can identify an advisor who knows which
stocks to pick
and yet and yet here's the weird part
the advisor is not rich
I mean to me that's a red flag if
somebody's telling you how to buy stocks
and they're not rich
it should be a little red flag but other
people say yes I can find the people who
make less money than I do because if
you're if you're wealthy the person
telling you how to manage your money is
less successful than you so some people
know how to find a less successful
person
who can make all the right decisions
despite
knowing that Warren Buffett says that
doesn't exist
that there is no such person
this is what Warren Buffett says but
apparently he's wrong too because here's
what we've learned there are people just
regular people who are not doctors not
experts who although they would admit
maybe they can't you know look into the
data as deeply they at least know which
experts can
so they've chosen the correct expert
which is something I can't do
I don't have that power so I bow to the
superiority
of those who could look at all the
experts probably financially as well as
medically and they can tell which one's
got the right answer and they can do
that
by having enough knowledge that when
they look at the data themselves
without any special expertise or
background in the area that they can
know what the people who do have
expertise and background the era missed
so apparently all the people with vast
experience missed all of these things
that the some small number of people got
right but I don't have the ability and I
want to admit this completely I would
never be able to know which critic got
the right answer
but many of you do and I applaud you
because I said power that I don't have
and I don't know how to get it so good
for you
um
and uh then I looked at here's some
other smart people Andy Swann
on Twitter I don't know his background
but Andy said
that uh he knew from the beginning of
the covet
what the deal was so he made his
decision like in the fog of War because
I I said that in the fog of War we
didn't really know what to do so I
didn't blame anybody for getting the
wrong answer including myself
but Andy Swann says he did not only did
he read my mind today which is
I gotta say that's impressive
uh Andy Swann read my mind today
reported it on Twitter
and it was something I didn't even know
I was thinking
so not only did he read my mind but he
saw things I didn't even know they were
in there and then reported them so that
was pretty impressive but he also knew
the risk of covid and the vaccines from
the start
so during the fog of War when the
experts were saying we don't know
anything
Andy Swann achieved certainty
because he not only recognized that the
vaccine sounded sketchy and then he was
totally right right
but that he also knew that um the
bioengineered virus from a lab probably
we don't know for sure he knew how
dangerous that was and he also knew how
bad long coven would be
at the beginning now is that impressive
that's impressive
because I didn't know any of that I just
thought we didn't know anything
got everything wrong
so I'm a big old dope I can't do any
mind reading I can't even read my own
mind as well as Andy Swan can
so
I feel bad about that
all right um
what
I wrote myself a note and I can't
remember what it was
all right
well there we are the Great Barrington
declaration yes the Great Barrington
declaration people kept telling me Scott
listen to The Great Barrington
declaration and
I didn't realize that the Great
Barrington declaration also knew how bad
long covet would be
well I didn't know they knew that too
which was amazing
so they got that right right from the
start
so
Mary Rose what are you talking about
crazy
yeah I got Trump right because I had
specific knowledge that's correct and I
got everything about the the pandemic
wrong because that's not my field
but I am impressed that the people who
also was not their field
but yet nailed it right right from the
fog of War period now that's impressive
those are the people that I want in
congress the people who who reach
certainty without any data whatsoever
if I could do that if you could teach me
to do that I'd be in good shape now
um does anybody own Tesla stock
and if you own Tesla stock
because I realized uh there's kind of a
big risk to Tesla stock that nobody's
talking about
oh a lot of you own Tesla stock yeah you
might want to reconsider this because
there's a there's a really big risk
um we know now that uh Elon Musk only
looks smart
because we found out that he got
vaccinated like I did big old dumb head
right now he said he did it because he
needed to do it to travel to his
gigafactory so for work it was like
really really important but still I mean
he had the option he didn't have to go
to the gigafactory
so so Elon Musk largely a fraud I think
we can say
um he probably got lucky building one
electric car company and then you know a
rocket company to go to Mars and that's
I mean that's like screaming luck luck
luck luck and then he bought Twitter and
saved Free Speech but that was just
because he got lucky on the other things
so he had a lot of money so basically
he's a story of just lucky on PayPal
lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky
now
contrasting
his blind luck
was Alex Berenson now experience and
despite not being a medical expert
also got everything right
from the fog of War period to today
now here's the risk to Tesla stock
what if Alex Berenson tries to make an
electric car
because we already know he's like way
smarter than Elon Musk because they both
looked at this complicated situation and
Elon Musk got like all the wrong answers
big old dumb guy and then Alex Berenson
who I mistakenly criticized early on and
I take that back completely
as a journalist
he beat 95 of all the medical experts
right
he's just he just lapped him killed him
and and I think he made money on it too
I think he probably wrote a book and
made some money so he made money and as
far as I know he did not get vaccinated
can you fact check me that Alex Berenson
did not get the so-called vaccination
right
so he is clearly the winner he clearly
saw this from day one
Elon Musk missed the whole story as did
I two idiots and
I what if he starts a car company
bergson has skills I mean this man can
this man can do things even outside of
his field
so
pretty impressive
now what I did which makes me look like
a freaking idiot now
is when I got the vaccination I made
exactly the same decision that Dr Robert
Malone made and he was one of the
inventors of the MRNA platform and he
got the vaccination for the same reason
I did like he waited a while he was a
certain age you know I think he's
younger than me but probably over 60.
he's in great shape by the way
um well let me let me say one thing
about the uh the uh the doctors who were
critics of the vaccination
have you noticed that they're all in
good shape
I just want to call that out like a
little compliment
you look look at um Berenson too Baron
said it looks like he has really good uh
body mass index wouldn't you say
it looks like he takes care of himself
so that's good uh look at Dr Malone
doesn't Dr Malone look like the
healthiest guy for how old is he
do me a fact check is he like
61 62.
that guy's in great shape imagine being
that good looking at that age
yeah I mean it's pretty impressive
um
and the other Dr McAuliffe Dr McAuliffe
does he look doesn't he look like really
healthy for his age
so maybe you should listen to these guys
they they all look pretty healthy
most successful people have self uh
discipline do they loan 64.
now is that not impressive
whatever Malone is doing you should just
do what he does because it's clearly
working
do you know that at my current age I
believe both of my grandfathers were
dead from old age
isn't that weird the difference between
then and now
all right uh
somebody says they're a doctor JG and
chose the the jab for travel purposes
and you feel like a winner well so far
so far
but maybe you didn't know that nobody
actually died from covet which I learned
yesterday from half of my half of my
viewers was not aware of that I thought
at 1.1 million people died and maybe if
they over counted it maybe it was really
only a hundred thousand but I have been
misinformed this whole time and
apparently nobody died
um have they been upgraded from Rogue
doctors yes now they are the correct
doctors
I apologize for ever calling them Rogues
although Rogue was never an insult by
the way you know that right Rogue just
means outside the mainstream
uh that was never meant to be an insult
I'm just saying this statistically
the people outside the mainstream are
usually wrong
in this case
they were the only ones who were right
and I was wrong about everything
no I I laughed and mocked them
individually but not because they were
Rogues yeah the Rogue part is not the
insult the the insole is the other stuff
I said
so I'm not denying it I'm just saying
the road part wasn't part of the insult
all right
is I get a lot of questions about
Georgia Milani in Italy I'm not terribly
interested in her only because Italian
politics don't really have much effect
on me
why did I mock reason and knowledge
let me answer that question I'm being
asked here why did I mock reason and
knowledge because I didn't have either
one
obviously I was not operating in a
reasonable way because I got the wrong
answers and obviously I did not have the
knowledge
so
how much more of an elegant I take
I'm trying to be fully transparent
uh can hypnosis affect dreams probably
everyone with leukemia died as covet no
I I've can I've admitted I was wrong
about everything and nobody died of
covet it's imaginary
so there's that
all right
um
repent and accept the faith of others
and experts that's just true see my
problem was I didn't trust the experts
but what I should have trusted is the
people who don't have expertise
and their ability to tell me
which experts with expertise of the
right ones
and I couldn't do that myself but I
should have believed the people who told
me they could
do I miss being a guest on Alex Jones
here's the thing everybody says when you
know anybody who's appeared on Alex
Jones as I have
um
it's a fun time
if Alex Jones is actually a great guy
like interpersonally
he's a fun guy like is it just a
completely fun experience now I just
said yeah I just said what I believe and
he can say what he believes and you can
make up your mind
here's another MD who did not get the
vaccine for travel purposes and also
feels like a winner
so we've got a lot of people who are
winning and I'm the loser in this one
I'll tell you I was losing heart in
Santorini
and uh Bora Bora
I was I was feeling pretty bad there
yep it felt like the dream vacation of a
lifetime because there were almost no
other people at the resorts imagine
going to the top
uh tourist destinations in the world
and having nobody else there he
basically the whole staff is just
waiting on you
yeah but I didn't at the time I thought
it was amazing but in retrospect I
realized it was just a terrible terrible
time and I never should have done it it
was also dumb and uninformed
well Christina was texting the Tate
Brothers somebody says
uh
all right um
what did it cost you oh my God it costs
a lot yeah
yeah those two vacations were insane
cost wise I don't recommend them on on a
cost-effectiveness basis
no like it wasn't more fun than say
going to Hawaii at a quarter of the cost
but it was interesting to do once
I mean I'm glad I did it
so a lot of people are having trouble
taking yes for an answer
so some people still think I'm saying
that you are
that people were right for the wrong
reason
like you remember before I said I think
people you know maybe maybe the people
who didn't get vaccinated could turn out
to be right
but mistakenly I said for the wrong
reasons but then I realized that they
could determine the science where the
scientists could not and then that
changed my mind
all right so is there any other stories
I missed
no yeah so just to clarify somebody says
do you mean we're all guessing no no no
I mean I was guessing
and those of you who got the right
answer obviously were using good
analysis and uh clever heuristics as
well as better data and I think you did
a better Deep dive on the data so that's
how you got the right answer very much
Alex Berenson like now I here would be
the real imagine if all of you who also
got the right answer on the vaccination
so-called
what if you started teaming up with Alex
Berenson
combined all of your analytical
abilities and build an electric car
that's why Tesla stock is kind of shaky
today
because we we know that that risk is out
there
that's probably why Elon Musk is
lowering the prices on his cars
panic
panic because when you you know if you
have a choice of driving a Tesla or a
Berenson
are you going to drive you know double
vaccinated
Tesla car or are you going to get a pure
blood
electric that will that will really rock
Easy Choice Easy Choice
okay
um
what you're out
you're out
no I want to drive a Barrington
not a not a Tesla vaccination car that'd
be crazy
all right
uh electrics or what
is the WF still on
the world economic forum
or is that over
do you think we're do you think the wef
stuff is overblown or not
did I watch SNL no
um
yeah I do wonder if the WF is overblown
I mean it's real and it definitely has
an impact but I wonder if those impacts
wouldn't happen anyway
all right
um
Norm book review We I still haven't read
any books this year
prostitution was overblown
all right I don't have anything else to
say today but here's here's my
prediction there's some big story
Brewing oh there was there was some more
stuff about Joe Biden's documents
what does it tell you that the Joe Biden
document story keeps trickling out
like there's always a little bit there's
another document so there's yet another
document what does that tell you
I think it tells you that the Democrats
are trying to get rid of them
now we've been saying this for a while
but you know the the evidence just keeps
that trickling and the the fact that
it's the trickle attack
that's like the classic look of uh like
a political op
like the the non-trickle would just put
it out there and then people would
forget about it but the trickle is what
keeps it alive when you see the trickle
going on
like oh there's one more document
one more document
and
how important do you think any of the
documents are
do you think that anything Trump had or
anything Biden had will have real
importance to security
I feel like not
yeah I feel like not
I I think the most likely explanation
for it all
is that nobody at that level takes
classified documents too seriously
unless it's a real Secret
right like if it were actually like the
nuclear codes I don't think Biden or
Trump would have taken them home
I don't think so but let's say it was uh
it was a report about a topic that is
generally classified but if you do this
one thing on that topic it'd be like ah
that didn't make any difference I feel
like it's the ones that don't make any
difference where the leader just says
well it's classified but
you know doesn't make any difference
it's like not important
right now the other thing you know I'm
seeing the argument that Trump was
President so he could declassify things
Biden was vice president at the time so
he couldn't and then others say well but
the president didn't do a process
to which I say
can I can I be the lawyer defending
Trump
that would be the easiest defense in the
world
and they say okay he did not follow the
process for declassifying then I would
say can you describe the process
and then the prosecution would say yes
the the thing the process and I'd say
well can you show me the document
that describes that process well it's
not written down but because he didn't
do anything that looked like a process
therefore the process wasn't followed
you mean the process that is not
required
and is not specified in any
constitutional or other document
now I'm Trump's Defender and I say how
about this
if he took him home is there any
ambiguity about what he intended
none
they're simply taking the man of a
secure place with a big folder that says
classified there's no ambiguity in that
here I have a classified document I'm
walking out the door with it in my hand
is that a process
I say yes
that is the process if the president
takes it out of the building
he just Declassified it if he hands it
to somebody who's you know doesn't have
the classification
he just Declassified it
because there's no process
if doing something that is obviously
declassifying it taking it out of the
classified environment if it's obvious
what he's doing I'd say that's
as good as anything
to me I would just be done I I can't I
can't even fathom
a jury not buying that argument or at
least all 12 of them you know they're
not going to agree but you could get you
could pick off six people in a jury
and you could take six people and say
look if there's no process
walking out the door with them is the
process that is the process because
there's no ambiguity about it there's no
no question what he intended
if he knew he was doing if he didn't
know he was doing it then
then it wouldn't be his responsibility
right but if he knew he was doing it
that was his process he just did it and
then it was the process
he created a skiff in his house well
that's another question
yeah there's a probably there's a DC
jury problem that's for sure
right
scotus has already ruled to that effect
they should
read free says Scott thinks he wasn't in
the mass formation because he was
mistrusting but he bought into the hyped
up fear machine right off the bat
because he's old and has respiratory
issues
Now red are you afraid of the
vaccinations
because I was afraid of neither the
covid nor the vaccinations
so I I had extra lack of fear
which which got me to the wrong place
so I should have had more fear not less
so I think your problem is that I didn't
have enough fear
because I think you know the locals
people can back me on this early in the
pandemic did I not say multiple times
out loud
I'd like to go get the covet as soon as
possible
did I not can you can you validate that
yeah the yeses are coming through so the
people who watched me the most
know that at the beginning of the
pandemic I said I hope I get this right
away I just want to get over it get over
with
so that's why so saying I hope I get it
is what you're calling being afraid of
it I hope I get it
that's afraid that guy's afraid I hope I
get it and then at home
honestly I did very little social uh
distancing my household was not a
socially distanced household at all
but I guess I did that because I was
afraid
so I guess that's your interpretation
but I wasn't afraid of the vaccinations
apparently I should have been and I
wasn't afraid of the covid don't know if
I should have been
but uh no I wasn't afraid of anyone
I did say that we should close the
border to or the travel from China right
away but that was under the context of
figuring out what was going on
those before we knew anything
once we knew that most people survived I
was like well just give me the ship I
want to just get it over with
all right
uh
Steve Kirsch looking at the airline
pilots abnormal EKG readings
yeah I don't I don't believe any of that
story
uh do we have a right to know if our
airline pilots have taken the jab no you
don't have a right
oh yeah run clean quit or is quitting
yeah Ron Clane the chief of staff for
Biden I don't think that means anything
the Chiefs of Staff quit so often I
don't know if it means anything
uh now following procedure and so doing
the possible nuclear secrets oh
interesting
all right yeah so there's no rules about
the declassification they can do
anything they want unless it's nuclear
um
Trump accepted my endorsement on true
social is that true
when did that happen
does that just
are we just truth and now
can we can we look at this while you're
while you're here let me open up my
truth app
see if it pops right up
uh
he's complaining about Mitch McConnell
all right
let's see what did you just retweet me
and looking at his
uh
did he do a lot of tweeting today
I will see it
uh oh is this it
there we go
oh he's oh he retrieves me talking about
the single issues he says knock out the
cartels all right good for him
is that today
oh oh there it is he goes thank you
Scott I accept your endorsement I
knocked out Isis I will knock out the
cartels
that's what I want to hear
that is exactly what I want to hear
all right
all right
here I'm in the middle of a story again
I keep saying this but
you see it too right
do you see that there's no way to
explain how I'm in the middle of all
these stories right I mean I know that I
talk about them in public but so does
everybody
like everybody's talking about them in
public but how do I end up in the story
it should be just another person talking
about them but yet I'm in the story
somehow
yeah but it's it's not just me who
thinks this is weird right
and how how often it happens because
I've called it out in the past and then
you keep watching it happen it's not
like I'm just looking at the past
I'm telling you what's happening and
then you're watching it happening in in
real time
I don't understand it unless we're a
simulation there's no way to explain it
um
so somebody asked me for an asthma
update so I use I use the puffer unless
I have an allergic reaction that
triggers it so I figured out what it is
on it's sulfites sulfites are an
additive to some foods
and sulfites some people get an allergy
too although you could argue whether
it's real allergy technically
but if I accidentally
imbibe something that has a sulfide in I
can feel it immediately it triggers
asthma so if I'm not triggered I don't
need it
but if I'm triggered I need it
temporarily
uh
yeah there's sulfites and alcohols and
sauces and stuff so salad dressing is
the Killer
uh comment on why you think the lawyers
said they found six items and not six
documents
six items versus documents
well
I don't know maybe there were some
graphic images
and they don't know if a graphic image
is a document
I don't know I'm not sure that that
do you think it could be a box
items like it could be a folder with
lots of items in it an item with lots of
documents that's possible
that is possible best cure of IBS
marijuana
yeah my enemies would want to secretly
play poker with me but that's only
because they think they would take all
my money and they would I'm the worst
poker player in the world
eggs have sulfite you're kidding
yeah yeah marijuana for IBS
instant cure
oh
um by the way
I would like to also confess
that uh although I as my critics have
said I apparently I'm very trusting of
of uh
the medical community
you know if I ever told you this I
haven't gotten a regular flu shot in a
lot of years do you know why
do you know I haven't gotten the
ordinary flu shot in I don't know
20 years
do you know why
because they're because I don't
trust them because I think the the risk
is higher than the reward
so I I'm the guy who trusted medical
science so much that I don't even get
the one that everybody says is safe
you get that right even the regular flu
shot
I won't go near it
but everybody was sure that I was I was
trusting the science of the other one no
I distrust everybody
if you don't understand that about me
you're really going to be confused about
anything I say yeah if you think that
like I'm I'm trusting some entity no
no
when I play poker do I just want to lose
and get it over with yes because I hate
playing poker I uh yeah I probably just
want to lose as fast as possible I don't
think that helps my performance at all
yeah that's true I want to get I want to
leave the table as soon as possible
all right yeah Vegas is not for me
uh can we talk about why they don't push
these J shots that Johnson Johnson shot
probably because if they did they'd be
admitting there's something wrong with
the other ones
was Christina any reason you got the vax
yes
yes for travel
right yeah I mean she's the one who
wanted to travel
um it wasn't something I initiated
but it was a Hackman trip two trips
you never explained why the leaders of
the simulation would allow you to move
it from inside well I don't know that
they would allow it it might just be
that it happens
it might be just like an outcome
yeah and and it could be how you play
the game
you know if you can't make any changes
from inside the game
imagine if you had virtual reality
you put on virtual reality goggles it
puts you inside a game
but you can control the game
at least you can control where you move
in the game and stuff like that so it's
not that unusual that if you're in a
game you'd have some control over your
over your gameplay
Matthew Crawford I don't know what
that's about
what
all right uh
do you think Putin and Russia are likely
to lose I don't know I don't think
there's any lose-lose with Ukraine and
Russia I think you know both of them are
going to be in bad shape no matter where
we end up
