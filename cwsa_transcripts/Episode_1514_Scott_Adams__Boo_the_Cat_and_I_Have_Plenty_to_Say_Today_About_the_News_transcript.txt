of your day possibly the best part and
it's going to be amazing
can you feel yourself getting happier
already
yeah you can feel it a little bit it's
starting to
starting to kick in
and you haven't even had your coffee yet
you're well you might have had some
coffee but you haven't had the
simultaneous sip and where do you see
how good that is
i'm just firing up your comments here
so that i can see them
and then we will commence with the
simultaneous sith the thing that makes
all of you happy
come on come on there we go
do do
do and now
what will it be
that's coming next
what is it yes the simultaneous sip the
best part of your day every single time
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker jealous design a canteen
joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better
including my cat boo
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right now go
alex took a pre-simultaneous sip
yeah not not authorized alex not
authorized but this time i'm gonna let
that go
i'm gonna let that go
all right let's see all the excellent
news that's happening today
sipping like a gangster
all right
so we have uh
our first segment is vampire news
vampire news
an illinois man
woke up with a bat on his neck
and the bat was biting him in the neck
and tragically he died of rabies
apparently rabies can be treated
effectively but only if you get there in
time
and he did not and he's the first person
in the states
uh
in the state's history since 1954
who died from a bat bite
now
i'm not in
i'm not an overly cautious person
i'm not really superstitious
well i just think as a
precaution
that if a bat bites somebody on the neck
you need to burn the body
just burn it
now i'm not saying it's likely
that it's a vampire situation and this
person will become the
walking dead and
turn the rest of us into vampires
i'm just saying it could happen
why would you take a chance
just just burden the body
should be a law
if you're killed by a bat
bite just burn the body
all right just joking there in case some
of you don't have senses of humor and
you know who you are you know who you
are yeah
well in permanent news
you know what the permanent news is
right it's the news that's the same
every day
for example permanent news would be
the pope denounces violence
have you ever heard that headline the
pope
speaks out against violence
turns out the pope doesn't like violence
permanent news
here's the other permanent news
uh looks like the infrastructure bill uh
is going to have some problems getting
passed
hmm have we ever heard that before
is this the first day that the
infrastructure bill had some trouble
getting no it's permanent news
permanent news
um
so i guess uh biden canceled his trip to
chicago
and you know over this three 3.5
trillion dollar budget thing that seems
to be part of it maybe that's part of it
maybe it's just a health reason we don't
know
but apparently that trip was to promote
this new requirement for workplaces to
mandate proof of vaccinations
or else issue compulsorily compulsory
weekly testing
so
let me break this down to you
the biden administration
like the trump administration all right
i'm not making a distinction between the
two of them because of the same in this
following point have somebody in the
administration who i believe is corrupt
not at the top i don't think it's biden
and i don't think it was trump
but somebody in the
approving part of it maybe the
fda seems to
be the reason we don't have
cheap rapid tests
how would this feel
if we had cheap rapid tests
where any company could just say it's
only a dollar a test let's just
just test everybody every two days or
whatever
now i suppose that would be
impossible too yeah a dollar a test
would probably add up really quickly if
you're a big company wouldn't it
but the point is
do you think it's legitimate for your
government to prevent you from having
cheap um tests widely available and then
also require it
for your employment
it's the government that prevents you
from having cheap tests and now they're
going to prevent you from working
why
because you didn't take a cheap test
let me just say that again
the government's corruption and i'm
pretty sure it's corruption because
there's no other reason even offered
nobody's even offered an alternative
explanation of why we don't have cheap
tests in this country because they have
them in other countries
there's no technology problem there's no
manufacturing problem it's just an
approval problem
which they don't have in other countries
apparently
so yeah you can get cheap tests now but
only from a few companies and at a high
price
too high for
you see
there's boo
give you a little preview of boo
who appears to be looking into my coffee
all right
we'll bring her back for uh i think
she's gonna come back for a
for her own uh appearance here
hey boo
she still has her feeding tube in
as you can see
there's her little little feeding tube
so they they actually attach the feeding
tube
uh they put a hole in her neck
so the tube goes into the side of the
neck and
dangles into the top of the stomach
so i've got a shove meds and food down
there several times a day
which is pretty much my full-time job
now i'm basically a full-time cat doctor
but anyway
i don't love a government
that prevents me from having cheap tests
and then says you you're gonna get fired
if you don't take a cheap test
completely illegitimate
let me say that again
i know i know for most of you the issue
is going to be can the government force
you to take a vaccination and that's a
good that's a really good issue
but that's not what i'm talking about
i'm talking about the government acting
like the pointy haired boss
what what is the point here boston the
dilbert comic do all the time
creates a problem the boss creates the
problem
and then assigns the blame to the
employees well why didn't you
perform better well it's because you
created a situation which we couldn't
perform
likewise
joe biden's administration and its
corrupt
whatever is corrupt in it same same
corruption that was with the uh trump
administration i assume
that's an assumption but it looks like
it
um
he caused the problem and then he's
gonna he's gonna fire you for it you're
gonna get fired
for biden's failure
i'm not making that up
if if biden requires you to get either
vaccinated or tested and getting tested
just isn't practical because they're not
cheap available tests
biden got you fired
he caused the problem
and then blamed you
caused the problem and then blamed you
not acceptable
so i hear your issue about the
government forcing you to do anything
sure
good issue
but on top of that
if you don't give us tests because
you're corrupt
no
flat no
that's a hard no
now
the question of whether there should be
mandates for employment or not
i don't even get to that question
you can't even get to that question to
have an opinion on it
because you have to get past the
question of is it possible to do the
testing it's not because of the people
making you do it
i don't know what could be a less
legitimate government
policy that's the most illegitimate
thing i've ever heard of
top that really really top that
top that for being illegitimate
it's hard
rasmussen has a poll
asking about the border
situation
and
one of the questions was is biden or
trump's policies on immigration better
51
said trump
now 51 is you know
sort of what you expect whenever there's
a political question you know it's like
half and half you know one side versus
the other side
but 51 on immigration is a pretty big
number
saying trump
but more revealing is only 32 percent
support biden now let me ask you this
let's say this this poll is accurate
because rasmussen has a good track
record
so let's say the poll is accurate
how in the world does any democrat get
elected again
how
really
with
32 percent
think that biden has the better policy
on immigration if it's only 32 percent
that means he's losing you know
substantial support from his own base
how do you you can't get elected if
you've lost even a little bit for your
very base
speaking of which um kamala harris is
getting some heat from israel
because apparently she visited a
classroom and a student asked a question
in which the
the question
um
embedded in the question was an insult
to israel in the sense that it
referenced what they were doing as
ethnic genocide right so that was the
student's characterization
and israel is complaining that harris
sort of just listened while nodding
i think the nodding was the part that
seemed bad because it seemed like she
was nodding in some kind of an agreement
with what the student was saying now i
watched the video and i didn't see that
so i think it's fake news
what i saw was that she was doing the
i'm listening to you nod
as opposed to the i'm agreeing with a
specific point nod because if you look
she just sort of is doing the soft nod
as the student is talking i think it's
just good listening skills
i didn't see her agreeing or disagreeing
with a student
but
she should have pushed back harder yeah
i mean if you're israel
if you're israel you're looking at that
and saying uh
you just let a student say on video
that israel is doing something called
ethnic cleansing or no ethnic genocide i
think
and you're the vice president of the
united states and you didn't you didn't
take a moment to say well
i don't think that's a fair
characterization
she just sort of let it stand and then
vader point now
i don't really have a strong opinion
about this particular situation because
i don't think that kamala harris was you
know agreeing with the genocide part of
it but
she didn't handle it well
and if you lose israel
and let's say you you lose americans who
are pro-israel especially in the jewish
community in america
how do you get reelected
how do you get reelected i feel like
biden is losing black lives matter
with the mandates the vaccination stuff
i think he's losing everybody with
immigration
i mean how does the guy get how does he
get reelected or how does any democrat
get reelected i mean it's not going to
be biden but
all right so it looks like it's going to
be a
i would guess the midterms are just
going to be a blowout for republicans
what do you think
does it look like now that a lot could
change between now and the midterm
election right there's something
changing every day
but
but even if you imagine you know some
some baseline level of fraud even if you
imagine that's true
doesn't it look like the midterms are
going to be a just a blowout for the
republicans
abortion question yeah that's a good
point the abortion question could work
in the other direction
you're right
um
yeah that texas abortion bill really
really does change
the situation
but i wonder
i wonder if it's only going to affect
those states
that are maybe republican anyway
you know if it only affects the states
where you you were going to rip you were
going to get a republican
you know because if you if you take
texas they've got immigration that's in
everybody's face
and then abortion which is in some
people's face
like when i think of the abortion
question i've sort of aged out of it
being relevant to me personally
like
don't think about it but the immigration
feels like it affects everybody a little
bit
so to me it looks like a blowout but
lots could change between now and then
uh biden got embarrassed by his own
generals i guess
general milly
and at least one other general maybe
austin said this too
that biden was advised to leave 2500 or
so
troops
in
afghanistan
permanently
and that is shown to be a
making a lie out of biden
making a liar out of him because he said
to stephanopoulos in an interview not
too long ago
that nobody advised him to keep 2500
troops there
and then the general said yeah we
advised him to keep 2500 troops there
so what do you make of that
i'm not sure they're talking about the
same thing
because it sounded like millie and the
other generals were advising a permanent
force
of you know 2 500-ish a permanent force
whereas the question is about a
temporary force
for the purpose of getting americans out
i feel like those were different
questions
because i do believe that millie
probably did recommend a permanent force
and i do believe that biden probably
said no
there will not be a permanent force of
2500 people
is that the same question
as leaving enough uh leaving enough
military there to get our people out
it's a different question isn't it but i
feel like the news reported this as uh
i think both sides i think even cnn
reported it as a lie
i'm not so sure
it might be
i mean certainly you know
it certainly raises a lot of questions
might be a lie
but the way biden answers the question
was he said he doesn't recall it he
doesn't remember anybody advising that
that might be true
partly because he might just not
remember it
maybe partly because maybe nobody asked
him
maybe nobody asked them maybe they just
talk to each other and then tell biden
what the decision is
go watch the full hearing somebody says
there would be some context that that we
would miss that's always a good good
general uh
good general advice
general advice huh
um
but
i feel as though maybe there were two
topics that we merged into one we've
conflated the
question of staying there forever which
we didn't want at least you know i
wasn't too crazy about it
um with the question of staying there
for a while
now and i also don't understand the
question about the people who have had
months to get out and didn't
do we have any visibility about what
that's all about
what about those people who had months
to get out
and then didn't
and then apparently there was also the
uh
you know some thought that we would keep
a permanent embassy there and that would
allow people to get out who had
struggled
but that doesn't sound like a good plan
they still have to get to the embassy
so
it seems to me that biden's instinct to
not have anybody stay there long term
might have been right
i don't know i i think it's too early to
to say i mean if it turns out that the
terrorism reforms and we're you know
we're caught surprised again then it's
going to be a terrible idea
but if that doesn't happen and let's say
the taliban decides on their own to
squash anybody who might cause trouble
in their country
trouble that would come back on the
taliban again
we might be fine it could be that the
taliban will take care of their own
terrorists because they don't need us to
go back there
do you really think people wanted to
stay there yeah i think the military did
i think the military did some parts of
it
do you hear my cat snoring
she's quite happy here
here we'll give you
give you a little cat view
we're changing from scott view to cat
view
i think you'll appreciate it
there's a little feeding tube
very sad but she seems to be doing fine
all right i'll let you look at the cat
while i read this this other stuff
no i'm going to make you look at me
yeah i'm gonna make you look at me sorry
i know nobody wants this but it just
doesn't work as well
all right
back to me
no
[Laughter]
all right i'll compromise
i will hold the cat
on my lap
while i do the rest all right
compromise
a little bit of cab a little bit of
scott
the best of world worlds all right
so there's a
story uh today about this new book
coming out from uh ex google
guy
top technologist from google
who is warning us about uh ai becoming
smart and taking over
now you've heard this before that ai
will become super smart
uh at some point and then
we'll become the super intelligence that
we don't know what's gonna happen so it
could be dangerous
and the the google ex google guy tells
this story that is really a scary one
apparently there was they were doing
some experiment
in which they um
they're doing some experiment in which
they were
teaching a bunch of robot arms
in what they called an arm farm a whole
bunch of arms that had been programmed
with some kind of ai
and i guess the
arms had been programmed to sort of
learn
so there's a bunch of arms and they're
just doing stuff and then they're
learning from doing stuff and
something like that
but at one point
one of the arms
uh picked up
what was it
it picked up a ball and showed it to the
camera
imagine being there and seeing that
you're watching all these arms and
they're just trying things and doing
things
and it's got some ai behind it but it's
learning as it goes
and then suddenly
out of nowhere
one of the arms reaches up grabs the
ball
holds it in his hand and then shows it
to the camera
what did that do to your brain
well apparently it changed the life of
this google guy because he was like oh
sorry i swore again but the s-word isn't
so bad
um so he wrote a book about it to warn
us now here's my take
i don't think that meant anything
i think it was a random you know one of
the
millions of things it could have done
and it just did something that
that looked kind of human
i think it was just
a coincidence and it just freaked him
out i don't think it
showed any spark of like intelligence
exactly
but
um
if you think ai is inevitable
do you think it's a risk
do you think that humans
are at serious risk because of ai
here's my take
yes
yes we're definitely a serious risk
because of ai
it's a risk to the cia somebody saying
in the comments
can't we just unplug it
nope
do you know why you can't unplug it
it won't let you
can google unplug their algorithm
not really
not really because the ai has persuaded
them not to by giving them lots of money
right so you could physically but you
won't because the ai just won't let you
it won't let you do it it'll give you
reasons why you shouldn't do it and
you'll think well those are pretty good
reasons then you won't do it
here's where i think i believe that we
will merge
i believe we will merge with the ai
and
there was a comment that i saw on
twitter
in which somebody um
said that he'd rather be dead
than to have the ai emerge with him so
he didn't want to be per human part
machine
rather be dead
to which i said
did you type that tweet on a smartphone
see where i'm going on this
the gentleman who said he'd rather be
dead than a cyborg
doesn't realize
he's already a cyborg
if you have a smartphone
you're a cyborg
it just isn't physically attached but
that's just a convenience right it's
just a convenience that's not
physically attached there's no reason it
couldn't be and there's no reason it
won't be at some point it'll just be
attached it might be attached as like an
earpiece
have you seen the new uh headsets that
attach to your uh i think it's the bone
instead of your ear
so you can have it i think it's behind
the ear or something and it doesn't have
anything that goes in the ear hole it
just somehow picks it up from your head
or
vibration in your skull or something so
yeah you will have permanent attachments
you're already a cyborg there isn't any
way it's going backwards you're cyborg
sorry
all right
um
let's see got a few other things i want
to talk about here quite a few actually
it turns out
um
new york times is uh reporting that the
fbi was in fact deeply involved
with the january 6 events and that they
had embedded
um informers or agents or whatever
and so the reporting that tucker carlson
did
after revolver.com broke the news
about the fbi informants being part of
that group
new york times has confirmed it so now
the new york times has blessed it now
what did i tell you about fake news
one of the best ways to identify fake
news
is if only one side of the political
world reports it as true
if the left says it's true but the right
says it's not it's not true if the right
says it's true and the left says it's
not it's probably not true
right so the only things that are
probably true
are things where they both agree
and they now have both agreed that the
fbi was deeply knowledgeable about the
events of january 6
before they happened
enduring
even during
so
how much responsibility does the fbi
have
for not warning
i don't know law enforcement
sufficiently
and how much involvement did they have
in causing it
because we don't know that yet do we
because that's that's not unheard of
right
it is it is well within the
possibility
that the fbi agents could have been
actively acting like participants and
planning stuff
you know just to be
in the inner circle so
you have to worry about
uh you really have to worry about the
fbi at this point
i guess i'm saying something obvious
aren't i
man
there
have you ever seen a trusted
organization fall so far so fast
in the last what five years the fbi went
from one of our most trusted
institutions
to we don't even know if they're on our
side
not really you don't even know if
they're playing for your side
who knows what they're doing
at this point i mean they do seem to be
you know as aligned with russia as they
are with the united states because look
at you know look at the fake
you know collusion stuff the fake
everything basically i mean the fbi
seems to be working for russia as much
as the united states
i hate to say that and i'm only talking
about these few high-profile issues i'm
not talking about
you know every fbi agent who's just
doing their job and you know doing
useful stuff
but for this big political high-level
stuff
can't trust them at all
well
as you know i've been saying by
twitter and otherwise that
china is not safe for business
china is not safe for business meaning
that if you were a ceo and you made a
the decision to go bring new business to
china let's say build a manufacturing
plant
there or have them manufacture for you
you would be taking a risk
that would be hard to explain to your
shareholders
because we're saying that china's got
all kinds of you know
theft problems of intellectual property
probably there's a physical problem that
your executives could be thrown in jail
for leverage for some reason
you've got the risk of losing
electricity
apparently tesla is running out of
electricity
you know at least the manufacturing
plant in china
so you've got all of these risks
and so i ask you this question
i'm going to ask you this in the
comments
how many people think that i can
personally
end business with china i mean it was
never one person but how many think that
persuasion wise
the sentence china is not safe for
business
could
take china down
no way to know
but i would say it's well within the
feasible
domain
there are some things you think well
it's a long shot it might work
this is not one of those this is not
really in the long shot category this is
in the pretty good odds category
and the reason is this
i have this sort of special domain that
i
uh occupy
one is that i'm the dilbert creator
right so if you're the dilbert creator
and you focus on some element of
business
that's like really absurd and is not
working you don't want to be the ceos on
the other side of that
because nobody wants ridicule
criticism fine
you know people can take criticism all
day long if you're a ceo you can take
criticism
you didn't get that job without being
able to handle some criticism
but not ridicule
ridicule is different
nobody
wants ridicule
and ridicule is coming at you in a big
way
if you want to see what ridicule looks
like just move some business to china in
a big way and then let me know about it
see what happens
you're going to see ridicule like you've
never seen
right
and you're not going to be able to
ignore it
so
since businesses are really a cover your
ass enterprise especially at the
executive level it's all covering your
ass right
now that i've laid down the risk
i just laid down the risk it's very
clear and i would think you would all
agree that that's a risk
one ceo is going to walk right into that
walk right into the risk
and i just say ah yeah i heard there's a
risk and i might get ridiculed but gonna
do it anyway
some might
it's gonna be a bad play
yeah and you don't have to stop every
company from doing business in china you
just have to reverse the trend
and
i got retweeted on this point um
the the point about uh
china is not safe for business and the
context was i'm losing energy and uh dr
jordan peterson retweeted that
and said expect much more of this
but what's interesting is he didn't
define this
right so the tweet
that i retweeted was about china losing
energy didn't have enough power for
their factories
but my comment on top of it is that
china is unsafe for business
and then jordan peterson retweeted my
comment and and the content below it
and said expect much more of this
more of which
more energy problems
or more
people saying that china is too risky
for business
which one was it
what do you think
do you think he was talking about much
more
realization that china is risky
or much more energy problems which do
you think jordan peterson would think
would be important enough to retweet
i don't know
here's a fun speculation
jordan peterson once said i was just
reading this this morning he once said
that his iq tested at over 150 when he
was younger he thinks it may have
degraded over time with age as iq does
um
but he's got a genius iq
and he understands
psychology
right
ian says i thought we don't do mind
reading correct
you don't do mind reading with certainty
but you do as as a human being speculate
about what people think and that gives
you your your options set oh might be
thinking this then i'll do that but
might be thinking this other thing so
i'll do that and then you put odds on
them but if you have certainty about
what somebody's thinking well you're
just crazy
that's just crazy
[Laughter]
but if you have but if you speculate
because you have to because you have to
make a decision
well that's reasonable it's just hard to
do okay
so here's my question
does jordan peterson recognize the power
of the persuasion
you know the psychological power of
telling business that it's too risky to
do business in china and warning them in
advance so that if they do it they can't
say they weren't warned
can't say you weren't warned that's the
worst situation to be in it's one thing
to make a mistake
but it's a different deal if you make a
mistake that you were warned you were
clearly warned right
here's what i think
there's a non-zero chance that jordan
peterson is not talking about the energy
problem in china
or is partly talking about
don't know i mean he's the only no he's
the only person who knows what he was
thinking when he tweeted it
but i have at least some suspicion
that given his enormous iq
and his specific domain of expertise
that he knows exactly what i'm doing
i think he knows exactly what i'm doing
and i think he just boosted it
don't know for sure it would be a fun
question to
ask him that
i've never talked to him in person but i
would ask him that
now one of the things he said that is
that his iq he expects that his iq is
decreasing with age because apparently
that's the thing as i said
but i'm not so sure that's the right way
to look at this so i'm gonna i'm gonna
you know i'm not sure it's a
disagreement
but an additive thought
i feel like we should have a different
concept called a functional iq
and a functional iq as opposed to a
genetic iq just what you're born with a
functional iq would be
the product of whatever your genetic
intelligence is what you're born with
times your experience
now experience is you know qualitative
things so not all experience is equal
but experience in this context would be
a talent stack
a series of talents and knowledge that
you've put together over time that work
well together
i feel as though
at my age
my functional iq is
insane
whereas my genetic iq probably decreased
but i think my functional iq
my ability to understand the world is
informed more by the things i've
acquired
because they fit together one forms the
other
one gives you a pattern that's you know
fits with the other one gives you
context that you didn't have etc
and
so i would say that
jordan peterson and i think i fall into
the same category i think his functional
iq is way higher than it was
his his native genetic iq maybe maybe a
little less a little less sharp but i
think his functional iq is just through
the roof
you know things he's learned along the
way
um
all right
i'm going to talk about
some um how your brain works
but
i'm going to give you a warning for some
of you um who want to bail out
i'm going to be talking about memories
false memories
risk profiles and stuff like that
but the context is going to be
vaccinations
all right so i'm going to start with
this question so some of you want to
want to leave now and i respect that
so if you'd like if you just hate
vaccination talk leave but i'm not going
to tell you to get vaccinated
i'm just going to be talking about some
things you haven't heard before
on false memories and
and on uh
you know thought processes
so i asked my twitter followers how many
of you have a false memory of me
being unambiguously pro-vaccination for
people whose risk profile is entirely
different from my own
21 percent
said they do in fact have a false memory
of me being unambiguously
pro-vaccination for people whose risk
profile is different from my own
now that that's the important part
i have never recommended anybody get a
vaccination
because your risk profile isn't mine
like my decision is personally is just
purely personal
it doesn't have any effect on you
none
so
uh the good news is that about 80
of the people
realized that i was talking about myself
and my own decision and you make your
own decision but 20 had an actual false
memory
of me pushing vaccinations for you
can you confirm
those of you in the 80
could you confirm for the other people
watching
that i've never pushed vaccinations for
you can you confirm that
yeah so look at look at the comments you
can see the confirmation the people who
watch me every day
know i say this as clearly as possible
yeah the confirmation so the
so this uh this topic has nothing to do
with vaccinations it's about false
memories
once you learn how common
false memories are
it changes it it changes how you see in
the world forever
this is a perfect example
false memories now some of you are gonna
you know i haven't seen the comments yet
but i know
somebody's gonna say well not you didn't
exactly promote it but the way you
talked about it blah blah
no that doesn't count
because i said directly and many times
i'm not trying to influence you and i
wasn't
because it would be immoral and
unethical for me to do that that's your
decision not mine
all right um
next thing
how many meds do you take that you don't
know the long-term risks
let's say you know i asked the question
on twitter but i you know just to be
funny i said this morning how many meds
have you taken this morning that you
don't know the long-term consequences
but let's let's say in the last year you
know most people have taken some kind of
medicine in the last year how many of
you
uh have taken meds in which you don't
know the long-term consequences
somebody says maggie says zero i only
take supplements
does anybody want to answer maggie
maggie says she doesn't take any drugs
that might have a long-term consequence
she only takes supplements
maggie
nobody tests supplements
nobody tested those
right now i happen to think they're
probably safe
but maggie
nobody tested them
sorry
so here's my point
again this is not about vaccinations
this is about how people think
i think it's very unlikely that you
lasted a full year without taking any
kind of med
that you don't know the long-term
consequences of now i made this i made
this comment and i got a
pushback from larry sanger do you
recognize that name he was one of the
co-creators of
wikipedia
so one of the co-creators of wikipedia
who by the way has a problem with
wikipedia's model at the moment so he's
sort of a sort of a critic of you know
how we
understand our world let's say
but he pointed out he said you said my
point doesn't have much purchase the
point that the other drugs you take you
don't know how safe they are either he
said many of the drugs commonly
prescribed which is what i'm talking
about drugs commonly prescribed have
relatively long histories and are known
to be safe
or are known to have side effects that
aren't as bad as the condition they
treat
do you agree with that so here's one of
the co-founders of wikipedia
making a point of fact
that many of the drugs commonly
described have relatively long histories
and are known to be safe
do you agree with that
i'm just watching your comments i see
mostly now
nope nope
oh here's the thing who do you think is
checking
name the organization that's checking
so i took uh i took an acid reflux
medicine this morning
all right something for acid reflux i'm
confident that when it went through its
fda approvals it was tested quite
rigorously quite confident of that
how many people are going to check
my headache
tomorrow
to correlate it with the fact that i
took
i took an anti
anti-anti-acid an anti-acid
who's doing that
which which organization
is talking to me
or even a representative sample it
doesn't have to be me who who is doing
the survey every year to find out if the
people who took an antacid and also took
let's say some other medicine
and found out there was some problem if
you take the two not if you take the one
but maybe if you take the two together
who's studying that
nobody
nobody studied that how would we know
if a thousand people had
heart attacks this year because they
took name any safe drug
would we know
no we would not we would only know that
a thousand people had heart attacks just
like a million people have heart attacks
we would have no idea
we are completely blind
to the long-term effects of the
medicines we take completely blind is
that really different from the
vaccination
so here's the math
the math of it is that all of our
medications are dangerous in the first
or could be dangerous the the part you
worry about is the first few months
and all of them have the quality that if
you get past the first few months and
you don't notice anything and you're
looking for it then
you're pretty safe
but not completely
right and when we're talking about
vaccinations you're talking about the
small risks because the risk of dying
from kelvin is small
so you're only talking about the small
risks can you tell me that aspirin
doesn't have a small risk how many of
you took an aspirin this year
you know aspirin would never get through
the fda approval right
now i heard this as a claim and i i
expect it's true but did you know
that the aspirin that you take every day
if it had not already existed long
before the fda
that if it were developed today and
introduced today it wouldn't be approved
too dangerous did you know that
yeah stomach bleeding etc right
so we don't know what any of our meds do
in the long term and but we do know that
the risk is probably lower we notice
but not zero
certainly
and specifically what about the mrna
you know what can we learn from classic
vaccinations
that would tell us anything about the
safety of mrna
i always say nothing
i would say there's nothing about our
history that would tell you if an mrna
vaccination is
is safe in the long run
now again everything that doesn't kill
you in the first two months has a pretty
low chance it's going to be a low chance
but not zero not zero
andres beckhaus asked this
interesting question
imagine if the mrna platform the
technology that some of the vaccinations
use
imagine if that had been used first for
cancer treatments and successfully
and had cured a bunch of cancers
now first of all
would you have been worried if you had
terminal cancer let's say or even just a
bad cancer would you be so worried about
the side effects
not so much right because the cancer is
so bad
that you would accept a pretty big risk
of side effects to get rid of it
so imagine if you will this didn't
happen but we know that the mrna
platform is being looked at and tests
are going to be done on cancer
so there's a very
high chance the scientists say that the
same platform used with vaccination
could make a big big difference in
cancer and some other things as well
suppose that's where you'd heard of it
first
suppose you'd heard of it first as
curing cancer and it was just a
five years we've been curing cancer with
this stuff
and then they said we're going to use
the same platform different we're going
to tweak it differently by the same
platform
and we made a vaccination
do you get the vaccination then
now
would that tell you anything you didn't
know
nope
there would be no extra information
if if we had been using it for years for
cancer it wouldn't tell you anything
about your risk for using it for
something else but i mean logically it
wouldn't tell you there's no there's no
connection there
but how would it make you feel
the question is about how you'd feel
you'd feel safer wouldn't you
just because you'd say well we've got
five years of testing cancer with the
same platform
and even though the platform was tweaked
and it's different a different
application
that gives me some safety
yeah i think i think the question is
fair because i think we would be
influenced by our prior experience even
if the prior experience was completely
irrelevant because it would be it would
be close to completely irrelevant
but it would still influence you you'd
still say well it worked for cancer
even though it's a different different
application
yeah
um
so
let me ask this so here's a question i
asked on on twitter and a poll i said if
you're unvaxed
because of the unknown long-term risks
how many how many in the comments how
does this describe you that you're not
vaccinated because of the unknown
long-term risks
if you're in that category
uh how many meds did you take this
morning that are in the same basically
the same situation and eight percent
said yes that this morning
they took meds
about eight percent said they took meds
that had the same risk profile but they
took them anyway even though they
they're using the same logic to not take
vaccinations
um
but to be fair
to be fair
you might be taking a medicine now that
you know fixes your problem
and and you don't want the problem so
you're willing to take some side effects
and some risks
but you say to yourself but i don't know
what are the odds i'm going to have a
bad outcome with covet is so small
that do i take a risk to get rid of a
problem that's so small
compared to i've got a problem every day
with my allergies or whatever my thing
is my acid reflux and i know it works on
that
so at least i'm solving the problem
the trouble with the vaccination is you
don't even know for sure you're solving
a problem
because you might not even be infected
and if you got infected you might not
have a problem
so yeah it's different
i'm not going to say that the analogy
works but i was wondering if people had
any uh
cognitive dissonance around
the fact that we routinely take things
we don't know the long-term risk it's
pretty ordinary
and
what about the risk i also got some
pushback from viva frey
or frye
how does he pronounce his name
uh barnes and frye f-r-e-i
um i'm sorry there's some names that i
will never be able to pronounce
correctly and i just i have to
universally apologize in advance for
screwing up people's names
but
um
it's pronounced
somebody's helping me in the comments
and you're pronouncing it differently in
the comments so i see fry as the correct
pronunciation
okay
let's go with fry
well now i see people saying free
damn you in the comments damn your eyes
he pronounces it fry okay that'll and
fry it is
all right um
all right so here's the question
the question is this
can the government make you do something
like get a vaccination that you don't
want
is it legitimate for a government to
force you to get vaccinated
no
most of you say no right not really
legitimate for the government to tell
you what to do with your health care
but
i would argue that
i feel like
we're already way past that point
the government tells you everything you
do
do you know that you're not allowed to
drive on the sidewalk with your car
and you're certainly not allowed to
drive on the sidewalk with your car if
you drive 100 miles an hour
you're definitely not allowed to do it
drunk
and you're definitely not allowed to do
it without your seatbelt on
the government
the government controls everything you
do there's nothing you can do without
government control
except maybe even your own thoughts are
getting dangerous these days
you know if you put your thought in a
tweet you might get fired almost
everything we do is controlled by
somebody either society or the
government
i get the point and i agree with it
so let's see if you can handle this
nuance
i know you can because uh
my viewers here are way smarter than
average
um
you could be completely against the
government forcing you to take a
vaccination
but you have to acknowledge that you've
agreed to the government controlling you
in a million other ways
that are
i would say just as invasive
in their own way may not be your body
invasive but it's just invasive to your
life so
can can you handle that opinion is it
consistent
is it consistent to say the government
absolutely should not mandate you get
vaccinations
at the same time i say oh but i do
accept the government's
mandates for all kinds of other stuff
basically every part of my life
is surrounded by mandates
one kind or another law guideline
regulation
social ostracism
yeah
tolerated but not agreed
don't accept
force isn't appealing yeah i'm not
agreeing with force
i'm absolutely against the government
telling you what to do
i'm just telling you that you've
accepted it in a million different ways
so if you think it's that different
not so sure do you know the government
can take your son and put him in a
military outfit and
send them to a foreign country to die
your daughter too
and we might have to change some laws to
make that happen but i don't know where
that stands at the moment
but yeah the government can take your
entire body
and ship it to another country in front
of bullets and tell you to kill people
which one is more intrusive
or invasive
the government takes your entire child
ships into another country to be killed
or versus a vaccination that went
through the fda and
at least short term it looks pretty safe
right
your government can tax the piss out of
you
and there's not much you can do about it
your your government
can allow china to send fentanyl in to
kill your kid that's what happened to me
my government
allowed china by not being you know not
pushing back hard enough my government
allowed china to send fentanyl to the
country to kill my stepkid
i mean your government is doing all
kinds of terrible things all the time
you just got used to it
that's all you're just not used to the
vaccination i'm not saying you should be
all right i'm just saying that the if
you're looking at all these other
government regulations and counting them
as nothing
i don't know how you can justify that
intellectually
you are a completely controlled human
being within a
government and society system that
doesn't let you do almost anything you'd
want to do
i mean if you looked at the total subset
of things you'd like to do
and then look at the look at the things
you're allowed to do
it's pretty small
compared to the things you'd like to do
right
um
somebody says they're going to report me
to homeland security for all my
anti-government talk
um
yeah the china is using our post office
to send fentanyl here
amazing
we should just stop accepting mail from
china
maybe make some exceptions for you know
people who have factories there well
maybe yeah we could just do shipping
containers but not mail how about that
how about that we just stopped taking uh
any package from china we'll we'll take
mail if it's just a letter but we won't
take any package it's got to be on a
shipping container or it can't come
maybe they just
switched to shipping containers and it'd
all be the same then
um
yeah stop china for producing pet feed
yeah there was that problem with the dog
food killing dogs
uh
michael's uh let's see
dee dee says my neighbor is running his
third power tool since 10 a.m
well i'm sorry
all right that's all i got for now
uh you want scott to get with dave smith
and the uh um
the lp what is that the uh libertarian
party
i heard this morning that dave smith uh
comedian dave smith might be thinking of
running as libertarian
which would be interesting
um i don't think libertarians have much
of a chance
but it's always fun if somebody makes a
i would love to see a comedian run for
office how much would you love
a professional comedian running for
office
well that could be pretty good i mean i
would argue that trump is a professional
comedian
i mean it's just part of his talent
stack
you know he trump has been funny in
public for you know decades
uh he just isn't his job description
that he's a comedian but he's definitely
got the chops
i mean they're very few people who are
funnier than he is
um
false memories
oh al franken
good point
al franken
i hate to say this because i have a rule
that i generally don't
criticize other humorists
uh but al franken i don't know if he
tried to be funny when he entered
politics i mean a little bit maybe
but i don't think he was he wasn't using
all of his uh comedian chops and he
wasn't exactly a stand-up was he was al
franken ever a stand-up comedian
it's a little different kind of a skill
all right
i think that's about all i've got for
today i've got to go do some other stuff
and i'll talk to you tomorrow
