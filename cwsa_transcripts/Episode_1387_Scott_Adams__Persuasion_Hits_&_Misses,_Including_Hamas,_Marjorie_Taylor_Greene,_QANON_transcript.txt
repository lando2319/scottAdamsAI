us and today will be one of the best
days
of the entire day
and you are here to enjoy it so
good work on that the first part of your
day is going
just the way you want it and i think
that's worth calling out
but but would you like to take it up a
level
yeah yeah you would and all you need is
a cup or a buck or glass a tank or gel
system
canteen junk or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous it happens
now
you know every now and then i think
maybe this time it won't be as good as
all the other times
and then i'm wrong it is sometimes it's
even better
it's amazing all right let's talk about
all the
fake news in the news uh
starting at the top so i did a search
this morning for
worse than watergate guy carl bernstein
and i wondered what would happen if i
just typed into my search engine
the phrase worse than watergate guy no
quote marks or anything
and if i do that on duckduckgo the
front page uh mentions me a lot
because i i might have been the first
person
to mock carl bernstein for being the
worst than watergate guy
i don't know if i was first or i was
just among the first to make that
point but on duckduckgo it's you know
scott adams scott adams said scott adam
said and then i do the exactly the same
search
no quote marks on google and
i'm not there you have to look for me
i'm you know you sort of have to dig
down
now i'm not going to claim that google
made some kind of a decision
to take my name out of that story
and nothing matters it doesn't you know
nobody nobody's any
worse for it it doesn't make any
difference but
what happens what happens if it's not
intentional
is that better i mean when you look at
the the difference
in a search result a pretty basic search
result of
something that's in the news literally
too much
and even that is wildly different in
terms of even who was involved
think about how gigantic this effect
is and if you imagine the worst
you say well they're human beings making
these decisions and
you know trying to cancel people and
that sort of thing
but what if it's not that what if there
is no human being
who is making any decisions is just the
algorithm
and two algorithms give you completely
different results
these algorithms are becoming the brain
of the world
at what point does it become impractical
to make any decision
that would look dumb if you made a
google search
or just a search right we're pretty much
training ourselves as humans to not make
our own decisions
you see that right because in the old
days
without internet if you said scott
what are you going to decide on i don't
know taking a vaccination or not or
anything
and i would say something like well i
don't have a time to go to the library
and check out a book
and research this topic so i guess i'll
just make up my own mind and
i don't guess use my bias
or something i wouldn't have much
information but
what happens when the internet exists
well if the internet exists
i'm gonna go search for the answer scott
what are you gonna do about taking a
vaccination
i don't know i'll go search for the
answer should i take it
is it safe and then i'll probably do
something that's informed by my searches
so in a way my my human decision making
totally flawed because i had less
information
is being outsourced to an algorithm
not even to another human to an
algorithm
and i don't know what's going to happen
who knows what's going to come back
today for example there's a news story
it's a little bit
early on this story so we might find out
a lot more about it
but apparently the summer russia
linked pr agency contacted
influencers social media influencers
on in france and germany and tried to
pay them
to say that the pfizer vaccine was
killing people
now i guess this got uncovered so it's
not going to happen
but think about this somebody was
willing to pay
influencers to say bad stuff about
a vaccine that's probably saving
millions of lives
and you know of course your mind goes to
well this is a
russia disinformation thing trying to
hurt france and germany or
maybe trying to make their own
vaccination look better or something
who knows maybe it's just a play on the
stock stock values
but this is the sort of thing
where imagine that this had worked
imagine that these
influencers had been able to
do the influence that somebody tried to
pay them to do
when you did a google search would they
come up because their influencers
might so
not only are we outsourcing our decision
making to
algorithms but we don't know
anything about what those algorithms are
being influenced by
is it influenced by money is there
somebody behind there pushing a button
is it just artificial intelligence is it
random
is it nobody it's not anything it's just
a bunch of forces coming together
but we basically turned the process of
thinking about
stuff and making decisions into a
completely unknowable process
where you just send it into the internet
and who knows what kind of result you
get or why you got it
it certainly wouldn't be related to
whether it's true
that's the last thing that's uh likely
to happen
all right speaking of uh influence
raspbian
rasmussen reports that um
they asked how many people had these are
likely voters they usually talk to
and they say how many of you have a very
favorable opinion of dr
fauci now this is just the top category
just the very favorables
liberals 67 had a very favorable opinion
of dr fauci
conservatives 17.
now i think we're all accustomed to the
fact that a political question
is always going to be divided by
political lines
but what exactly made the virus
political
i believe that this number you know this
gigantic difference between
67 percent liberals saying that fauci
was uh that a very favorable opinion
versus 17 for conservatives
this is this gigantic difference
and as far as i know there is no
political element whatsoever to a virus
i mean we overlay that stuff but the
virus itself doesn't have any politics
the science doesn't have any politics
per se nothing that would be associated
with left or right or
constitutional or wokeness or anything
can you give me any reason why these
numbers should be so different
is it because uh conservatives
like to flout the law
no even even the way that each side
acted in the pandemic was sort of
opposite their normal behavior
in a way i mean you would expect the
liberals to say
stop putting your laws on me i'll i
won't wear a mask
but instead it was conservatives a
little bit
non-obvious to me you can make an
argument that it was obvious
but i just don't think that we're seeing
anything but pure
persuasion and team joining here i
believe that the news networks
tried as hard as they could to make it
sort of a side versus side thing
because they kind of need to and they
succeeded
it looks like the news business turned
this into a political question
when there's no political element to it
whatsoever
you know i mean somebody has to be in
charge and they belong to a political
party
but still they're just going to tell you
what the science says and then you get
to make up your mind it shouldn't be
political at all
but it did it became very political
so i feel like in a normal
political question you don't see this
effect so badly
so if somebody says hey what do we do
about abortion and then you do a poll on
it
you know what it's going to look like
right you know the conservatives will be
largely against it the liberals will be
largely in favor of abortion
so if there is a political element
you know where the poll is going to come
out but this is the weirdest thing
that we we literally just sort of said
okay what side are you going to be on
you guys will be like against the
vaccine and
so we'll be more for it i i swear to god
it just looks like it was a sport
and we just picked sides it was like a
chess match
where you sat down and said okay do you
want to be white or black
and then it didn't matter which we
picked you know the
the conservatives could have picked
white or black and the other team would
have just been the other team
and i don't think i've ever seen it more
clearly than in this number
that this this is a pure persuasion
indicator and you can see that people
are not making up their own decisions
if you ever wanted to know that your
opinions are assigned to you by the
media
here it is these opinions were assigned
to people by the media
very clearly more clearly than i've ever
seen it
maple bob says once the censorship
starts it's in the realm of political
yes but the censorship doesn't start
until somebody's decided to make it
political i mean that's a decision
it doesn't just happen um
let's say let's test our ability to
predict
so one of the weird things about the
pandemic is that we didn't see it coming
i mean some experts did see it coming of
course
but most of us didn't see it coming and
then it was this completely new
situation that most of us had not lived
through in any meaningful way
so because it was a fresh field and not
the old
stuff we're always talking about we got
we all got to make
predictions and what's also interesting
is that because the pandemic has sort of
a
a limited time frame you actually get to
see how your predictions come out
and so this is the point where you
should either be building
humility or arrogance i suppose
because you can see how you did all
right i'm going to
uh you dismissed the lab theory thank
you
i wanted somebody to come on here and
misrepresent me
because i was gonna get to that anyway
and we see the the first one
so i so i'm being widely misrepresented
by people who say you said that it the
the lab theory is debunked
never happened nope i'm hearing it a lot
a lot of people are saying to me well
scott
you said it didn't come from the lab
nope
never happened and if you remember that
that happened
you might be a narcissist you might be
here's what here's what i did say i said
there's no way
that china intentionally released a
virus
no way intentionally if you if you lose
the word intentionally
you're losing everything it's the
intentionally that i said
did i ever say there's no way that the
virus escaped
from the lab accidentally of course not
of course i never said that how could i
possibly know that
and it does seem like the most likely
possibility
what are the odds it started really near
a lab that does that kind of stuff
so no there will be lots of people who
will tell me
that scott you said it wasn't the lab
nope nope you are having a false memory
and you might be a narcissist because
one of the things i learned is that
narcissists have exactly that kind of
false memory
sparky says the people who planned the
pandemic saw coming
i don't think anybody planned the
pandemic sparky
all right so here are the things that i
thought from the beginning or in the
early days
these were my predictions and or
interpretations
now some of you are going to argue that
we don't know the final answer on these
i think we do so i'll accept that
there's a difference of
opinion about whether we do know the
final answer
but here's here's my current view of
things
number one when the virus first
was spotted in china you can fact check
me on this but i was probably one of the
first
one or two people public people
in the country to vigorously call for a
shutdown of travel
can anybody confirm or deny that you
know i'll put that up to
public public review but i think i was
the first
or among the first one or two i think
jack passovic was
among the the first as well to say we
better close travel
now i said a week before trump did and
trump got in trouble for saying it so
early
all right so i'm going to claim a
victory on that
number two i did say this is not a
regular flu
this is a real virus that is really
going to kill you
some of you still disagree with that
maryland says the epic times revealed
the extent of the virus in china
if you're not following the epic times
you really should because they have the
best
the best the best view of china
on things that there could be so
yeah thumbs up to the epoch times for
that
um i said as soon as
dr fauci and the surgeon general said
you don't need masks for this virus
i said and i think i was the first
public figure to say this
and again i put this up to public review
if anybody said it before i did let me
know because i'd be interested in that
but i believe i was the first person to
say publicly
and vigorously they're lying
they know the masks work and that
they're probably trying to make us not
have a run on masks that's probably the
most accurate prediction i've ever made
it turned out to be exactly right now
some of you are going to argue but scott
masks do not work
i hear you i hear you but at the moment
every single uh industrial country
believes they worked all of them they're
no exception
so all of the people who are
professionals
who can read the research better than i
can better you can in most cases
all of the countries all of the experts
all of them believe the masks
worked just not in every case every
place right
didn't work so much outdoors didn't make
much difference if you were six feet
away and didn't spend much time
indoors whatever but i'm going to claim
victory on that
i know that some of you will disagree
but i would say i was completely right
on masks
and i said as in terms of the lab i said
that it
might be human-made
now i did not say this in public so much
but privately i did talk to people who
said yeah
it could be human-made and we wouldn't
know the difference so
i didn't want to say that in public
because i thought that might cause
trouble
but i can confirm to you that privately
i believed
it could have been man-made let's say
human-made let's make it less sexist
um i also told you
last year at about this time that
the human ingenuity would be shockingly
good
shockingly good so my prediction was
although we had no
good idea about therapeutics and the
experts were saying vaccines will take
five years or whatever they were saying
i was saying that the experts were wrong
and i was agreeing with trump
i think i agreed with trump before trump
agreed with trump
on the fact that we would be able to do
this at a very accelerated rate
and that when we were done the the
history would record
we did something amazing
how'd that go right on right now i
thought it would be more about
therapeutics i didn't think it would be
necessarily vaccinations that would be
the amazing part
but the vaccinations are literally
amazing one of one of the greatest
human accomplishments i would say and so
i'm going to claim being accurate on
that i told you in
about this time last year when it looked
like we might lose our
food sources and the economy would
crumble and
maybe there would be martial law and all
that
i told you that we wouldn't starve
that we would figure it out we would get
through it
and the world would not end or at least
it would not be any anywhere near the
worst case scenario
and i feel i was right
i feel i was right all right i also
believed and again i didn't make a big
deal about this publicly because it
would not have been responsible to do
that
but i never once disinfected anything i
ever bought
i never once disinfected anything from a
grocery store
i think in about the i don't know after
a week of trying to wear gloves
i just said i'm not wearing gloves if
people could get this from surfaces
i reasoned we'd just all be dead
you know or at least we'd all have it
and it seemed to be
sort of obvious early on it couldn't be
coming from surfaces
just because we'd all have it by then so
i was right on that
surfaces don't seem to be a problem
there was a lot of talk about
hydroxychloroquine i was never on the
side that it definitely works
and i was never on the side that it
definitely doesn't
and we still don't know so i'm neither
right
or wrong on that but at least i didn't
commit to something
that could be wrong i believed
without being scientific about it i was
fairly confident
that all the uh worry about the variants
not being effective or that the vaccines
wouldn't work against the variants
i believe that was probably the news
being
a scaremongers meaning that
the worry exceeded the actual risk and
it looks like that's the case
it looks like the vaccines vaccinations
will work against variants as well
and i also thought that the vaccinations
would be safe enough
could there be some danger we find out
later yeah
could we find out that more people had
problems with the vaccinations
health problems yeah we could
but i feel as though we already could
say
that the vaccinations were a good idea
now
i got a vaccination so that tells you i
i thought that would be the case
i've also been telling you that this is
not part of the great reset
that there's not some uh coordinated
plan
to change the world based on this now of
course the liberals
and joe biden are going to try to do as
many liberal things as they can
but that's just the result of the
election that's not because of the
pandemic
so i don't think there was ever a great
reset any more than i believed
q anon and i think that that's that's
turned out to be true
i also told you that it would be the
public that decides when
masks and social distancing is done not
the government
and i think i'm right i believe the
public is leading the government
on the demasking and should that's the
right way to do that
and i also told you that we would get to
the end of the pandemic
sparky says you believe the msm the
mainstream media longer than you should
have
sparky you need to give me a real reason
like an actual topic
you know what are you talking about
don't make global statements like that
that's what narcissists do
a narcissist makes a global statement
like you didn't believe
or you believe the mainstream media are
too long
what's that mean give me a specific
right
that's that's just basically a complaint
about me
that's not a that's not even talking
about a topic
so um and by the way that's probably
projection so sparky that probably is an
indication
that you believed the media too long
don't know that for sure but that's
that's typically what that would predict
and sure enough we cannot tell whose
leadership
decisions made a difference if you think
that you can tell
if desantis was better than some other
state
i don't know if you can i just don't
know if you can
and you're saying to yourself but scott
desantis
you know got to the same end point not
that many difference
not that much difference in dying he got
the same end point
but with much lower unemployment
so you can't compare they both had
roughly the same outcome of deaths
but one of them had much better
employment numbers so
that's the one that wins right no
because we don't have an employment
problem
there is no unemployment problem so if
one state has
high unemployment and one has lower
unemployment
it actually tells you nothing nothing
because everybody who wants a job can
get one
it's just that in one state they're not
looking for them because maybe they have
benefits maybe they just don't need it
for whatever reason
but are plenty of jobs just walk down
the street
they're help wanted on every every
business in my town
so no you cannot determine that
anybody's leadership did better
it may be true it could be true that
leadership
made a difference my my prediction was
you wouldn't be able to see it in the
data you just wouldn't be able to sort
it out
and i think that's true all right so
that's those were my
predictions and how they turned out and
i would
um rather than comparing yours to mine
which is not really the point here
what you should do is compare your
predictions to yourself how'd you do
and if you predicted everything wrong
take that into consideration next time
firebelly says uh i read influence like
you recommended do you think mass usage
and policy could be explained in part by
social proof
yes of course yeah people are influenced
by
other people and especially if they're
experts so
yes that's part of the influence
michael says funny three weeks ago you
didn't believe in narcissism
now we're all narcissists well michael
you are misinterpreting me
uh as most of you do and
it goes like this the narcissism that i
didn't believe in before
is the same narcissism i don't believe
in now
that hasn't changed specifically
the people who think they're better than
you think they are
they think well of themselves that alone
if that's what you wanted to call
narcissism that's sort of commonly how
we think of it it's just somebody who's
arrogant thinks they're better than
other people
what i said was that isn't a mental
problem
because it can be an advantage so it's
not a mental problem
if it helps you it's a mental problem if
it hurts you or hurts other people i
suppose
but when i did a deeper dive it turns
there
turns out there are this constellation
of behaviors
that are attributed to narcissism that i
did not know
operated in a consistent code-like
manner
that if somebody is in that category
they will act with all of those
behaviors
now that was like a whole new topic so
did i change my mind
that narcissism is real
no the way i defined it before is still
not real
and science agrees with me
the way i learned it should be defined
it has always been real and i didn't
have an opinion on it because i just
didn't know about it
so i am better informed
but i'm not wrong about what i said
before
i'm actually completely right about that
and you can confirm it
just look up what experts say about
grandiose narcissism they will tell you
it's not necessarily a problem for the
person who has it
it might make them exceed their
expectations
um galen says if i am negatively
affected by social proof
uh does that make me a narcissist
meaning if you do the opposite of the
crowd
i don't think that makes you a
narcissist but it might make you a
uh whatever is uh contrarian i guess
all right have you noticed that the
stories in the press about inflation are
all confusing and contradictory and
terrible
because inflation is one of those things
that
i think even economists don't fully
understand
so by the time a journalist tries to
write about it
um
by the time a journalist tries to write
about inflation they're misinterpreting
somebody who's misinterpreting something
and it's just garbage by the time you're
done
so what we're seeing in the headlines is
lots of scare stories about inflation
which when you dig down just a little
bit and actually it could be in the
story itself so the headline can be a
scare you about inflation and then you
dig down and you find out it's just
supply disruptions most of it is because
of the bounce back
of the economy so the economy is
bouncing back
at the same time that some of the supply
chains were impacted by
the pandemic so there's just a temporary
price increase
because there's a supply and demand
problem so that looks like
inflation our energy costs are going
high because the pipeline got stopped
and some other
you know green concerns but that has
nothing to do with inflation per se
those are special cases and usually
temporary
so is there a baseline
inflation we actually don't really know
yet
it should be i mean all the forces are
in play
that we should see inflation i don't
know how we could not
but we're not seeing it yet we're seeing
mostly special cases
so just be just be aware that the
headlines are sort of scaremongering
about
inflation at the moment but that doesn't
mean they're wrong
you know it could be that it's going to
emerge we just haven't seen it
exactly yet but it's being reported as
if we are
um here's a
related scary story have you noticed
that the
q anon stuff is just missing from the
internet now
remember all those twitter accounts
you'd see and all the
the q anon people and you'd see them all
the time even if you were not one of
them
at least if you tweet to the people i
tweet to
and the news on axios is that
researchers from the atlantic council's
digital forensic lab
found that the volume of q anon content
available online plummeted
following the moderation changes at
google facebook and twitter
so in other words google facebook and
twitter started
looking for content that would have
classic q anon references in it
and just got rid of it now
they succeeded now i'm not
i don't think that the world is worse
off because
q went away and by the way do you know
that q
stopped posting so if you believed in q
do you still really because q
kind of went away q is gone
so the internet and the big platforms
made an entire category of thing just go
away
in this case was it a good idea or a bad
idea well it probably didn't hurt
anybody
i don't think anybody got hurt by this
but what happens the next time they want
to make something go away
look how easily they made this go away
they just made it go away
they can do this with any story they
don't just do it
on stories that probably were better off
without
like q anon they could do this with
anything
and i i don't know what could be scarier
than watching them disappear an entire
category of
people from the internet so that should
alarm you let's talk about the worst
persuasion i've ever seen
honestly good luck finding a worse
example
um
rebel asked me how much i prepare for
for this well i'll show you so what i do
is i copy and paste from articles and
tweets
um and then i just have notes
so i don't have too many notes about
what i'm going to talk about because i
usually know what my opinion is
and i just remind myself what the topic
is so
and i might put a note or two about just
to remind myself what points to make
but interesting question yeah and a lot
of this is practice so if
uh to do what i do now i've been doing
it
four or five years now or something like
that
um practice makes a big difference
big difference all right so yeah and
bullet points are the only way to go
here
so hamas uh the leader uh whose name
is maybe yaya
synwar are you serious i just noticed
his last name
is sin war s-i-n
w-a-r it's
they put together sin and war
and made the last name of the guy who's
the head of hamas
and his first name is yaya yaya sin
war our if this is not the
simulation talking to us i i don't know
what is
i mean really anyway so this
who's been hiding from the israeli bombs
he decided to come out in public so
people could see his reel
and what does he decide to do he decides
to hold up for the camera
a young child and to make sure that the
the young child is holding uh
the assault rifle just right and is
wearing camouflage
so he's basically holding up a child
like it's just a little child
with a an army military gun
to show that even the children are
willing to die for
hamas i guess and
i thought to myself what is the one
thing that hamas has going for it
just one thing they have one thing going
for them
which is their human shields their
children in particular
all right we care more about the
children just because we do
right so they had one thing to protect
one thing to get right hey israel
you're killing our children it's all
they had they had one thing
and this takes a
a palestinian child and does the only
thing you could do with a child
to make people want to kill it
the only thing the only thing you could
do to make an
ordinary person want to want
to kill a child is to do what he did
dress him up as a terrorist and show
that that child will kill you
and then i say i'll kill that
child i'm probably gonna get kicked off
of youtube for this
but how did you feel when you saw the
kid
now i don't know how it felt internally
did the
did all of the hamas people say well
that's great yeah
children let's send our children to die
yes
yes is that what they said because maybe
i mean i don't know the culture well
enough
maybe it worked for internally
but he's not just persuading internally
he's persuading the world and he took
his only asset
the only asset is that we cared about
them
and we cared about the children in
particular it's all they had
and they made me not care about their
children all right now i'm exaggerating
right
but persuasion-wise they persuaded
toward
making us care less about killing their
children do you see how bad that is
i've never even seen leadership this bad
i didn't know it could be this bad i
didn't know you could even
if you tried as hard as you could to
come up with what's the worst thing we
can do to our own people
you'd have to look pretty hard to come
up with something this bad
now compare that to israel who
immediately took this and
tweeted it around and said look at this
israel a plus persuasion
hamas f
you can't fail harder than this this is
the worst persuasion i've ever seen
now i'm giving it the the
dilbert uh bad leadership
bad management label which in america
might mean something but
i don't think it'll change from us
but it should be worth noting that the
uh
perhaps one of the most uh public
critics of management has just labeled
hamas poorly managed
so on top of whatever the politics are
all right you
even divorcing from the politics of it
all which is hard
but you can do it if you just look at
the talent
just look at the skill none
none hamash you just need to get some
leadership there
fix that geez all right speaking of
persuasion
uh and speaking of epic times uh adrian
norman
who is author and writer and contributes
to the epic times
tweeted this he said that books by scott
adams
that's me should be required reading for
black
conservative pundits and influencers
many of us
he's he's black so he can say this many
of us lack
real persuasion skills thus alienating
the very audience we claim to want to
reach
before that audience even hears the good
news of conservatism
and i would
let's say uh arrogantly or
i will narcissistically agree with this
statement
that it doesn't have to be me i mean it
doesn't have to be my books that you're
reading
but black america just needs to
improve their persuasion skills because
if you want
black america to thrive and i do
you got to get the persuasion right you
got to get that right
and they don't have it even close to big
right and it looks like maybe they're
not
studying it in the right way so
um so certainly as
adrian points out adrian norman points
out that
black conservatives such as himself are
finding value in learning to persuade
so i would uh i amplify that point you
don't have to read my books you could
read
um childini uh influence is a great book
that's a good place to start
trump has legal problems with the state
of new york
and i was abused to watch a legal
analyst
on cnn he said he wanted to warn the
audience
and it's funny that you would have to
put it that way i'd like to caution the
audience
that it doesn't mean trump's going to
get you know
convicted of anything or even indicted
and
here are the points made why trump may
not be
in as big a danger as you think and
these are interesting points
number one trump doesn't use email
looks pretty smart now doesn't it
trump doesn't use email so in order for
trump himself to be in trouble
as opposed to the organization which
would be you know less of a
less of a jail threat to trump
in order to show that trump personally
was aware of anything that may or may
not have happened
you're going to need either you either
need him to admit it
that's not going to happen you need a
record
that he wrote ideally not somebody
talking about him
but something that he wrote ideally
could be contemporaneous notes but i
don't know that we have any
and he doesn't use email so there's
probably nothing in writing
and then if you don't have that you
usually depend on an
insider who flips most of the insiders
it's a very small number of people who
have worked there for a long time
do you think they're going to flip
probably not probably not and then
beyond that
i think there's going to be an opinion
and a judgment question
so here's what i don't think it is i
don't think you're going to find like a
falsified document we would already know
about that i think
so i don't think you'll find a document
that somebody just changed a number on
you know something like
really obvious like that won't be that
i'm guessing and this is just
speculation at this point
that there's going to be a real judgment
involved here
in other words it will be this point
where somebody says the value of this
building that you said for getting a
loan
was x but when you value the the
business for
paying property tax you said it was a
lower value
they can't both be true can they but
here's the thing
they can be they can both be true they
can be different numbers and both be
true
because one is a lending context
one is a property tax context and you do
have the option of treating them
differently in fact it's not even
uncommon
so i think it's going to come down to
some kind of a judgment call
and i don't know if anybody gets
convicted for that
it looks political and
i i tried to speak very very carefully
oh i'm gonna have to sign off here real
soon i tried to
speak very carefully on this topic
which is uh i feel
when i see trump being chased legally
and i don't see strong charges so
we're not aware of any charges that look
look good at this point right
um i take it personally
i feel like trump is sort of the canary
in the coal mine that protects the rest
of us who have ever said anything
positive about
him or politics or conservatism or any
of that
i feel like if trump goes down for
charges that i personally feel
are i'm going to take it
personally
let's say that again if trump does go
down
or even if they try to take him down on
charges that the rest of us look at and
say that's just
i'm taking it personally like this isn't
politics anymore
this is personal and let me let me say
as clearly as i can
no violence right nobody i'm not
suggesting any violence
it doesn't help anybody won't get you
what you want won't get you anything
don't do any violence but would i act
differently if i take it personally yeah
i would yeah i'm going to act
differently i'm not going to do anything
violent but i'm definitely acting
differently
if i take this personally
and i would like to call out marjorie
taylor green
for one of the greatest services to
humankind
certainly in america that i have ever
seen
i'd like you all to join me in a
standing ovation let me tell you why
first
don't stand don't clap yet marjorie
taylor green
for all of her faults that you you may
you may have some criticisms yourself
but for all of her faults she is doing
one of the greatest things i've ever
seen
any american patriot ever do she has
made
the left argue that you shouldn't make
hitler analogies
join me now in a standing ovation
for marjorie taylor green successfully
making the left
argue in public and consistently that
it's ridiculous to make
hitler and holocaust analogies thank you
thank you
thank you and if we could just put her
on
mount rushmore just for that i mean
she may do some more good things in the
future but just for that
that's that's it just just that just
just start carving
just you know just start carving putting
it right up there because nobody's done
anything better than that all year
and that is the end of today's
version of coffee with scott adams i
think it's the best one you've ever seen
until tomorrow and
uh yes sparky two-tier justice system
and we will see you tomorrow
