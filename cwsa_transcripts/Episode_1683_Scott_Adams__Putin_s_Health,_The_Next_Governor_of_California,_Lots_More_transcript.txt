good morning everybody
uh welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to you pretty pretty sure it's called
coffee with scott adams and aren't you
lucky to be here you are
you're lucky you're sexy you're smart
and damn it
you know it and you should
but if you'd like to take it up a notch
and enjoy the
camaraderie
the fellowship and other words that
sound weirdly sexist for some reason
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
attacker chalice or stein a canteen
charger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your
favorite liquid
oh yeah we're going to salisbury hill
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the other day
and it's the thing that'll make
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip go
yeah
yeah
coursing through every corp muscle in my
body
uh powering up
all right full power now you don't know
what you're gonna get now
well let's see what's going on in the
world uh china's uh pretty much screwed
they're shutting down things because of
covet
they've shut down life in shenzhen and
shanghai and
the foxconn
company that makes iphones is having to
move their business to other locations
and
well it's looking kinda ugly
and here's my question
number one
do you remember i've been warning you
that china's pandemic is ahead of them
i did that right
can somebody confirm that i've been
telling you that china's pandemic is
ahead of them not behind them
yeah okay i'm saying in the comments you
remember i said that i don't remember
anybody else saying that in public
do you
do you remember do you remember anybody
else saying uh i think china's problem
is ahead of them
certainly when omicron came because the
idea was that the virus was going to be
around forever
and the vaccinations don't stop it and
the chinese vaccinations especially
don't stop it
so
uh well it looks like sweden's pandemic
is behind them yeah i think the west
has largely conquered this thing
i hope so
but
um why is it that every single thing
that happens in the news has a supply
chain
impact this can't be a coincidence is it
just everything has a supply chain
impact whereas two years ago nothing did
am i right
it just went from everything affects the
nothing affects it everything affects it
there's something going on
that doesn't look
completely organic to me i don't know
what it is
uh could be that we're in the simulation
and we're testing supply chains it could
be weird coincidence i guess
zielenski
has picked up on my persuasion
not specifically my persuasion but let
me explain
so zelensky is now uh trying to talk
directly to the russian conscripts that
are in the russian
invading army now i don't i don't
imagine his
message can reach them too easily seems
like they would
be protected from many outside messages
but
he said if you surrender to our forces
so he's actually talking about the
russian military
being defeated militarily
and surrendering
and what he says is if you surrender to
our forces
uh that your people will be treated the
way they're supposed to be treated as
people decently
in a way you were not treated in your
army
literally zielinski is telling the
russian army people
that they would be treated better as
prisoners of ukraine
than as military members of their army
and you know what
he might be right
doesn't that ring true
because i think the russian transcripts
are really being treated as cannon
fodder
they're being treated as cannon fodder
for no gain to them or their country
really no gain
their their act the russian army wants
to kill these guys or put them in harm's
way they'll be damaged for life even if
they survive you know they'll be ptsd
and everything else so the russian army
is absolutely abusing their own
conscripts
and
i do think that the ukrainians
might treat them better as prisoners of
war
that's actually literally true
that's the damnedest thing isn't it
has anybody ever told uh an invading
army we'll treat you better as prisoners
than you're being treated by your
overlords right now and actually
and actually could sell that
you can sell it because it's true
i think
i think it's actually true
well
here's the part i wanted to point out
we've all been impressed at how
persuasive
zielenski has been
but then i look for a specific technique
if you see technique
then you say to yourself
where did where did he learn that
who taught him that
and if you if he's just sort of randomly
persuasive then you think oh maybe he's
just some kind of a natural or has
something to do with the situation he's
in it just as automatic
but here's the technique this is what
i've been waiting for
have you ever heard of a thing called
making you think past the sale
i talk about it all the time
it was a trump's main trick
he would make you think about how things
would be after you've made the decision
as if the decision is already
made and when he talks to the
russian
conscripts
to the extent that he can actually get
his message to them
he he talks about how they'll be treated
after they
surrender do you see it do you see the
technique
here's how you'll be treated after you
surrender
that's exactly
the right way to say it
rather than saying
you know you're in trouble your your
masters are cheating you poorly
he talks about what will happen after
they've surrendered
that ladies and gentlemen
is a tell
for professional advice
he is being advised
by somebody who knows what the hell
they're doing
i don't know that he knows this stuff by
himself
you know there's there's no uh
information we have that he
had some kind of training and persuasion
or something maybe he did
you know we know he's a good actor we
know that he presents well but that's
that's a very small part of persuasion
just presenting well and speaking well
you have to know the technique
this this latest thing he's doing
which does two things
well actually makes you it makes you
think past two separate sales
two completely different sales one sale
is imagining that you've
you've surrendered
and the other sale is that zielenski is
predicting victory direct military
victory over russian troops not survival
not survival
not a deal
victory
do you think he can
uh sell that story do you think there's
anybody who will believe the story
that ukraine is actually winning
or could win
and
the answer is
yes
in my opinion
half of putin's army might i'll put a
mite in there because we don't know
what's happening for sure i think half
of putin's army is trapped
and i think that between
nato
communication coordination and satellite
spotting and weaponry and even training
the the ukraine special forces
are
really really trained
i'm being asked if i'm high
amazingly
no
by the way i won't ever lie to you about
that if i tell you i'm not high i'm not
high
i don't really have any reason to
to tell you i'm not
if i tell you i am i certainly would
tell you what i'm not but i'm not
in case you
wondered um
somebody says good time for china to
invade russia
i don't think so
well i'm going to say that zelensi has
got some
persuasion and help
probably from somebody in the foreign
intelligence agency maybe one of ours
for example
and
um let me ask you this
who did you hear talking about
ukraine winning militarily
besides me
anybody
who was the first person you heard say
you know
i think ukraine might actually win
militarily
or at least give them such a black nose
that they have to leave
somebody says you did
somebody says none really
somebody says the entire msm that's not
true the the mainstream media thinks
that ukraine should have been
swallowed in two days
all right yeah
now here's what i wonder i think i think
i've told you that on some topics i
might be persuading and not just
predicting
i think the cia has picked up on
i'm not saying that they're copying me
that would be
acclaimed with no evidence whatsoever
but
people who know how to persuade know how
to persuade
if i were zelinski i would be talking
about a outright victory over russian
troops
even if i didn't necessarily believe it
was going to happen
i'd still be talking about it because
you want to put that in your heads right
you want you want at least you want the
people who are giving you weapons and
support
to believe they could actually win
otherwise why would they give you
weapons if you're just going to lose
anyway
so
if i had ben zielinski i would be
handling
this part of it
exactly this way
like exactly
and it's
it's the
i guess it's the precision of this
persuasion that makes it look
professional
there's a certain precision of of the
perfectness of his message right now
that just doesn't look organic it look i
mean it looks
it looks like smart people who know how
to do this or telling him what to do and
he's good enough to be able to do it
yeah ask if anything about zelinski is
true
the only thing i'm sure is true is that
he's persuasive
i'm sure that's true
everything else about ukraine i don't
believe
i don't believe anything else i'm
hearing about ukraine we'll talk about
some of those
oh here well here's a good example the
news was saying today that more than 140
000 ukrainians mostly men have returned
from europe
to fight for ukraine
do you believe that number
do you believe that 140 000 people and
people are being turned away
apparently they're being turned away
because there's quote no room
like ukraine is all it's all filled up
with people there's no room left for
more foreign fighters to come in
apparently the news says there are 20
000 appeals from foreigners who are
ready to come so people who are not even
ukrainian by
by any ethnic connection
people with no ethnic connection to
ukraine 20 000 of them have already
signed up to come fight because they
want to fight against the russian nazis
on the ukrainian
side
i don't believe any of that
do you
do you really
right no
somebody says yes
but on locals it's on those
so the party i don't believe is 140 000.
if you told me that 10 000
came i'd say that could be
if you'd heard the number was 10 000
would you believe it
i think i'd believe ten thousand
i mean even even that sounds high
but
i'd lean toward believing it
at 140 000 no way
no way
the entire russian army is 150 000
people
am i right
i mean the entire invading army not not
the entire russian army but the entire
invading russian army is 150 000 people
and you think that 140 000
uh foreign living ukrainian associated
people signed up and actually came to
ukraine to fight
no
what's not correct
there are 44 million in the country so
somebody says they can believe it no i
don't believe it
i'm not going to buy it
all right uh elon musk tweeted and
offered to fight putin one on one
with the winner getting ukraine
perfectly normal day
let's see what's happening in the news
uh let's see richest man in the world
uh oh okay he's uh offering to be the
champion fighter for the
ukrainian people
and he wants to actually have a physical
fight with putin and
then they'll decide
who uh who wins
what is musk up to
why do you do this
this is real by the way i don't know in
case you in case you thought i made this
up he literally did this must did
literally offered to fight putin
one-on-one
as a champion the winner gets ukraine
he really said it and then when somebody
asked if he was serious he said yes
why'd he do it
why'd he do it tell me why
you say publicity's done
everything the elon does probably has
more than one
more than one benefit or purpose so i'm
you know publicity is part of it but
publicity is not what i'm looking for
he's always looking for publicity that's
just a given because he doesn't have a
marketing department at tesla
somebody says high ground maneuver
close
close
here's what i think it is
number one
elon musk is not like us
will you accept the first premise
elon musk is not like us
i don't know what he's like but he's not
like us
he's better than us
i hate to say it but he's better than us
that's i mean it's not an accident that
he's the richest man in the world
uh he's he's he's smarter
one of one of the parts of his talent
stack
which he never gives credit for
because he saw engineering
you know engineering-centric
that you and you think of him that way
but he's one of the best persuaders
of all time
of all time
maybe
maybe the best i mean it's hard to
measure that kind of things you know
exactly but you could make an argument
he's the best there's ever been
because his companies didn't become
great companies because he's a great
engineer i heard somebody say that
somebody said that you should think of
of elon as a great engineer and that
would explain why his companies are
succeeding nope
nope
i think he might be a great engineer but
that would just be part of his talent
stack he's not an engineer for one thing
he's a he's a physicist
i think he picked up engineering as a
like a side job or something you know
just something he figured out on his own
here's what i know that maybe you're not
aware of
the people who came from the paypal
mafia
the so-called paypal mafia it was the
the folks who were part of that first
paypal startup
elon musk was one of them
uh peter thiel was one of them
um
hoffman was part of them so they formed
linkedin and everything peter thiel did
facebook pantera
and now
elon musk they all came from that same
little startup is that a coincidence
what do you think
is it a coincidence that three people
from that same startup
all went and did like amazing things
do you know what all of those amazing
things had in common
persuasion
everything they did that worked you look
at it you say you know i get
i get how they could do the engineering
but how do they get somebody to buy into
it
let me ask you this
how in the world
did a startup get banks to agree with
them being like a little electronic bank
when paypal was brand new
before paypal people were not sending
money
back and forth digitally
to each other
somehow
somehow paypal
convinced people to do something
completely outside of their trained
nature
to to to trust
an app with their money
that's really hard
how'd they do it
and then how they how did somebody um
build linkedin
linkedin was basically just a resume
online with you know some social aspects
and stuff i don't think linkedin was
ever the greatest idea or even an
innovative idea
but somehow everybody wanted to do it
and it became huge
so if you look at the persuasion element
of paypal
linkedin
facebook
and everything else that
these people do from electric cars do
you know how much persuasion it takes to
sell an electric car or to build a
rocket company to go to mars
i mean you're talking about
unusual levels of persuasion to get any
of that to work forget about the
engineering which is
super impressive
how about uber
you know uber didn't work because guys
were really good at making apps
although the app is really good
uber works because somebody was
persuasive as hell
and figured out how to
get past all these local ordinances and
oh my god
a lot of persuasion so the thing that
people miss is the persuasive power of
successful people they didn't get there
just by being good engineers ever
it's always persuasion too
and
that's what i see when i see elon musk
offering to fight to putin
one-on-one here's my interpretation
now of course i cannot read elon musk's
mind
if i could
i'd be building myself some unicorn
startups too because i guess i'd know
how to do it if i could read his mind
but
here's what i think
when elon musk richest guy in the world
knows he's going to get lots of
attention when he says something like
this
challenges putin to a one-on-one fight
your brain says two things number one
number one
that is absurd
am i right that's the first thing you
think okay that's absurd
what's the second thing you do
you compare it to what we're doing
already
and then what
it's not so absurd anymore is it
if you could literally choose
you don't have that choice but if you
could
to have ukraine fight it out the way
they're fighting out
men women children being slaughtered and
you know dismembered every day
or you could settle the whole thing
with elon musk having a personal fight
with putin and actually i don't know who
would win
you know because putin's i think elon's
got a size and youth
but putin has putin
i'll tell you who i wouldn't want to
ever get in a fight with
putin all right putin's basically around
my age and about my size
i feel like i could handle myself around
people my size in general especially my
age like if i ever got to fight with a
another 65 year old guy who was about my
age or my size i feel like i could take
him
but i don't feel like i could take putin
i think putin would dismantle me
i'm pretty sure
putin is 5'7 somebody says yeah
he would go macgyver on you all right so
here's what i think is uh
is elon's play i think that he is making
a ridiculous and absurd offer but doing
it seriously
so that your brain will compare it to
what's actually happening
which is even more absurd
than what he's offering
he's basically juxtaposed an
unambiguously absurd thing
with the actual news
and made you look at the absurd thing in
the news and say you know
the absurd thing doesn't look so stupid
anymore
because compared to what we're doing it
actually
literally
no joke
would be better for everybody
maybe even putin i don't know i mean he
might even combat a head might might not
be so good for
elon
elon might get killed
but making us think about how ridiculous
the war is how absurd it is
i feel like that's productive
because it's easier to stop doing
something that you know is absurd and
everybody else knows it's absurd
and that's why he did
he just introduced into the thinking
that war
is not just
a bad idea
it can never be a good idea it's just
absurd
and
yeah i see somebody in the comments
saying he's trivializing it now
i don't think so
i think he's trivializing it as
persuasion
as successfully
it it's a weird little move because it's
like a uh it's a chess move
that's not a checkmate
do you see what i'm saying
he's just taking the board and he's and
he's just shaking a little bit
not a lot
he just took the chess board he's like
just a little shake and a couple of the
pieces just moved into another square
but you don't see it yet
he's basically
softening up the room
so that if if decisions need to be made
that would normally not be made
maybe they can be there because a couple
of the pieces got moved it's a very
small change
to how we think about it
but it's real
it's real
it does make you give a little more
absurdity to the current situation
and i'm not sure that we had enough
absurdity
in our opinion of it
i feel like we thought the war sort of
um we don't like it
but that it made sense
am i right
no matter what you thought of the war or
who's wrong or who's right
on some level
it sort of seemed logical to you
like you don't like how we got here
but there's a logic to it you know we we
we poked the bear the bear poked back
they've got strategic
you know historical reasons you can kind
of make it all make sense in your head
can't you you can talk yourself into
that we got here logically
what elon has done is just rip that all
out and just said maybe not
maybe we did not get here logically at
all maybe we just got here
maybe we're in an absurd situation
and the only way out is to recognize it
the only way out
is to recognize it
the only way out
is to recognize it
because the only way out
is to recognize it
and elon just did that for you
now i don't know
i don't know how much thinking he put
into it like
it may not be even close to what i'm
saying maybe it was just a joke who
knows
but
ronnie says scott hasn't taken his hand
off his lap since he started talking
about eulog
i i'm not going to hide the fact
that i think he's one of the our
greatest
american patriots you know born in
another country but uh you know in a way
that makes him a perfect american
yeah i i have a complete respect for
elon musk so i'm not going to hide that
yeah he's ridiculing a ridiculous war i
think elon's frame that is ridiculous
uh
is productive
we'll see
you all saw the story about the russian
on-air
news personality who ran out with a
protest sign against the war you know
don't believe everything you say
about the war or everything you hear
and i guess she disappeared
so
is that the first time that russian
viewers would know that there's
something wrong
if you were watching at home
or even if you heard about it
and you saw somebody run on tv and
basically risked their life
because anybody who saw it knows that
that person risked their life or at
least their freedom
somebody risked their life to give you
this message would it wake you up
or would you say oh that's weird crazy
person
i wonder if this matters
don't you it might matter
it could be that we'll look back on this
this one brave woman
um who risked real literally risked her
life
to try to right or wrong and
boy i have a lot of respect for her
although i wouldn't have done it i don't
think i would have done it
yeah it's almost out of a hollywood
movie
all right
um
there's a
another story
that
i you know
when i see a story that's so perfectly
fits what people on social media were
imagining
i get real suspicious
so i'm going to tell you this story
and i want you to say
does this look familiar
meaning that does the story seem to
match exactly what
i had said on twitter
all right now i'm not going to tell you
that like i'm the only person who said
this
sometimes i tell you that because i
think it's useful i think it's useful to
track
who predicts things correctly first so i
know it's annoying when i say did i did
i predict that do you remember but i
think it's useful
because you should you should have the
same
you know idea of how accurate i am
uh in order to you know enjoy this live
stream
so
here's the story from the new york post
and it says that citing sources close to
the kremlin
senior figures in the five eyes
intelligence alliance comprising
oh well look at this using the word
comprising correctly in a sentence i'm
always impressed comprising australia
canada new zealand and the united
kingdom and the united states believe
there is a physiological explanation for
the russian president's globally reviled
decision to invade ukraine
so of course a lot of people haven't
been talking about it but now we're
seeing a story that the intelligence
people believe that there is evidence
that the sources the unnamed sources
highly highly dependable unnamed sources
speculated that putin who's 69
could have dementia parkinson's disease
or quote
roid rage
roid rage
uh from potential cancer treatments that
involve heavy steroid use do you know i
swear to god yesterday
i was taking a walk and i was thinking
to myself huh
i wonder if there are any cancer
treatments
that would give you
like anger issues
it turns out there are
apparently
steroids are indicated for some kinds of
cancer treatments
and
that could give you roid rage and
actually explain his entire behavior
would also explain his puffy face
his puffy face and his change in
decision making
it's all looking a lot like
a chemical change in his personality
because people know him say he's changed
yeah didn't i say that on day one
steroids
give me a fact jack
was i i don't think i was the first but
i was i think i was among the first to
say that looks like roids that looks
like steroids day one right
yeah
and i oh i did ask about it
okay oh good now i'm not gonna claim
that i had like some you know the first
in the world to say that but i was there
early
i think that's worth it
now here's my fake news
uh analysis of this
i thought it was true until i saw it in
the news
do you know what i mean
i thought i was pretty confident in my
opinion that there's something
chemically different about him
but as soon as i saw it in the news
and the news looks exactly like my
tweets
i stopped believing it
now that's a hell of a thing
that i believed my own opinion until i
saw it uh being uh confirmed in the news
as soon as i saw it confirmed in the
news i'm like oh i'm wrong they
confirmed it i must be wrong
because here's my problem
it looks exactly like what an
intelligence agency would want you to
think like a u.s intelligence agency
like a ukrainian intelligence agency
it looks a little like
uh our intelligence agencies and other
countries may have said look they're
gonna believe this anyway because people
are chatting about it in social media
so let's just put it out there like it's
probably true because they're already
primed to believe it
they didn't have to wonder if we would
believe it
because it had already been tested
you see what i'm saying it'd already
been tested
they knew people would believe it
because we already believed it without
any evidence whatsoever
so they just gave us some fake evidence
of you know people who are sources say
they think
and then it goes to the media and then
you think you're there's really a source
and then
so here's the thing
could i have caused this
i'm not saying i did
but i worry about it
is it possible i caused this
let me tell you what i know
i do know that intelligence agencies
watch me
do you accept that
now i'm not going to tell you how i know
but i know
because i've been approached by people
etc
so i know they i know that they're at
least
i know of at least three intelligence
agencies who do have their eyes on me
four i know four
if four intelligence agencies are
watching me
and and i've sort of uh tested and
advanced the idea that putin looks like
he's drugged
do you think that they could have gotten
the idea to just amplify it
i'm not saying that this happened i'm
just i just worry about it i worry
that i'm giving people ideas
without knowing it
i have no reason to think i did this i'm
not making that claim
but i worry about it
all right
um cnn has a story
oh let's talk more about putin so
apparently putin is a known
hypochondriac do you believe that
putin is a known hypochondriac
and they think that's why he's so afraid
of kovid but somebody else said and i
had never said this out loud but i
believed it for a while
that the reason he's so afraid of kovid
is that he has comorbidities
i think he's got comorbidities
which would suggest
cancer or or something bad which would
suggest
the steroid thing is correct
because if you're the head of a country
and you've got some kind of medical
problem that's going to slow you down
they might pump you full of meth
and steroids
to keep you going because you can't take
a day off if you're putin right
putin can't take a day off
i don't think putin takes sick days
am i right
i don't think he could take a sick day
because weakness
would you know be a big risk for him
politically
so i've got a feeling that he's pumped
up with whatever it takes to make him
look like he's still functional
while he's rapidly declining in some
kind of health related problem so that's
my that's my current analysis
so i'm going to say comorbidity is why
he's afraid of kovid comorbidities
um
there's a new threat in the united
states according to cnn they've got a
story
it's men who are involuntarily
involuntarily celibate
wait a minute
um
are incels involuntarily celibate
i thought people volunteered
i think
don't they sort of volunteer because
they just gave up on it
you know i think it's a
sort of a gray area whether they
volunteered or they didn't have any
choice
but apparently uh
now the government is worried that these
uh celibate men
who in many cases have bad feelings
about women will become
mass murderers of women because they are
misogynists
and
well yeah i get it i get it the incel
means involuntary celibate but what i've
seen it in
in actual popular use
it always seemed like people were
voluntarily
labeling themselves
involuntarily celibate does that make
sense
it looked like there was some free will
involved however you wanted to find that
anyway
do you think that's a big problem for
the future
in voluntarily celibate men
i think it is
it it sounds ridiculous
right it sounds a little absurd on the
surface but
i feel like it is
and i've often speculated much to my uh
destruction
the a big problem in the middle east is
too many men and not enough women
because if the high-end rich men in
middle eastern society
have several wives
necessarily there won't be enough left
over for the men the the lower ranked
men
so in theory there should be all these
extra men who have nothing to do but you
know kill and be killed
because we turn into killers when we're
not
domesticated
basically um
well ethan why do you need to say that
ethan has decided to inform me that my
wife divorced me
ethan
you're probably aware that i i know
about this right i'm kind of up to date
ethan
and ethan i wonder
when you wake up in the morning
and you start your day
do other people say i'm sure glad ethan
is awake
because there's a guy who brings light
and sunshine into our lives
ethan is a person who's always looking
on the bright side
ethan
some some people would say ethan is a
uh a worthless piece of a
dingleberry on the the ass of life
some would say that because his
contribution to a conversation
was
so
mind-bogglingly
useless and negative
that one wonders
if ethan will make it through life
or is ethan a
in-cell who will soon be killing a room
full of women
i don't know i don't know ethan
but it's one of those things
all right
um
what else is going on
oh lots of things lots of things are
going on
uh oil went down 30 percent
because oil prices are not real
oil is the only thing that doesn't
depend on the supply and demand
am i right
maybe there's something else
but i've been watching oil prices
forever
and one thing that is a guarantee
is that supply and demand doesn't make
any difference
talking about supply and demand makes a
difference
talking about it
but the actual supply
doesn't seem to make any difference
it's just the worrying about it that
changes it
so every time somebody worries about it
somebody else raises the price
if i write a story and say
i think x will happen so oil prices will
go up
what happens to the price of oil prices
or what oil price goes up right
if people are talking about it going up
it goes up
if people are talking about it going
down it goes down
it's not even related to the supply
now
of course i'm
exaggerating because of course in the
long run this supply is all that matters
but that's never what we see we see all
these short-term
enormous swings
and
all of it's just psychology based
so yeah oil can go up 30 percent it
could go down 30 with no change in in
demand and no change in supply
so remember all of this is
all of the oil changes are just
psychology about what we expect and
nobody can predict the future so there's
more uncertainty which raises the price
so uncertainty does always increase risk
which increases price
but i don't see any reason that it can't
plunge
the just as fast as it went up
how fast does it take
people to open up production facilities
that used to be not profitable but
because the prices are so high they are
it doesn't take that long to reopen a
well does it
somebody says years it takes years to
reopen a well that's
been capped
i would think a month you know without
knowing anything about anything
i would think a month
if
if oil were a thousand dollars a barrel
you don't think you could drill me a
 well in a month
really yeah that's where this comes in
really
yeah if let's say oil is a million
dollars a barrel
you don't think you could drill me some
new wells in a month
yeah you could
yeah you could
somebody says three months i'll take
three months
but it seems to me we must already be
massively um
starting to ramp up production
everywhere in the world i would think
so i don't think oil prices could stay
high
um
what do you think about the news that
china is helping russia
or might help them militarily joel
 tweeted he said in my opinion
the china helping russia's story is
largely fake news narrative cooked up by
anonymous quote anonymous source jake
sullivan who also briefed the media in
2016 about russia collusion he has a
demonstrated history of lying to the
media to the detriment of national
security
that's how i say it
now i don't know anything about jake
sullivan being involved that's a
different question
certainly there's reason to suspect
that this fits his wheelhouse i agree
with joel on that
but
i don't think i believe that china is
helping russia's story exactly
it makes sense that russia is talking to
china
and it makes sense that because they
have this unlimited partnership
their china might step up with a little
extra trade or something like that
but framing it as china helping russia
militarily
it's a bit of a stretch
it has a persuasion
feel to it as opposed to a news feel to
it wouldn't you say
does it feel like news
or does it feel like
redefining news to make it into
something new
feels like reframing the news
feels like persuasion
feels like
but could be wrong we'll wait and see
i saw some people following me today on
twitter you know twitter tells you who
followed you recently
and
i believe that at least two of the three
had followed me forever
and they had to re-follow me today
and somebody else had said the same
thing and this had gone away for months
and months for a long time i had not had
this issue of people being automatically
unfollowed for me has anybody been
unfollowed for me automatically
um i'm just watching the comments
i guess the no's don't tell me anything
because most people would be in now
somebody said uh yes i have last year
yes
i had to re-follow when you got a new
computer that's weird
um
so people say yes
somebody was it was two years ago
yes
now
there are enough yeses going by
that do those look like
people are just mistaken
because i watched my twitter account
reach a certain level and then just
plateaued
it looks like it's throttled
it certainly looks like it
i can't guarantee it but it looks for
all for all uh
all appearances it looks that way
twice
so somebody had to resubscribe to me
twice yeah the names that i saw
subscribing to me are ones that i've
known and communicated with
for years on twitter
and they had to re-sign up today because
the thing that if it had been random
names that i was not familiar with
i would have thought oh they got mad at
me someday and and blocked me or
something and then they changed their
mind but these are people i've had no
bad interaction with that i'm pretty
sure had just always followed me and had
to re-follow
um
here's the most interesting thing that's
happening in my opinion did you ever
wonder what would happen
if a lifelong democrat
ever figured out how to design systems
that took into account
human motivation
economics
and science
what would happen
well the democrats have a lot of
supporters
so just being a democrat should help you
get elected like half the time you would
win just by being the democrat
but what if you had a democrat who is
not just
going to win because there are a lot of
democrats
what if the democrat found a way
to design systems and solutions
that are compatible with all
republican
thought
well that person exists
and is running for governor of
california
michael schellenberger
so michael schellenberger is a lifelong
democrat who has uh
turned independent
and
there are actually more people
registered independent in california
than either
democrat or republican
if you could actually treat the
independents as a party
and get them to maybe see themselves as
a team
they would win every election in
california it's the biggest group
now i don't think that there are real
independents
i think people are really republican but
don't want to say so that sort of
thing but there's certainly elaine
you know if you if you think it's
impossible you're way wrong it's very
possible he can win very possible
because here's what he's got going for
he is a lifelong democrat
and as far as i can tell his
let's say his emotional
empathy are still exactly in that world
of trying to make sure everybody has a
good chance and a good life
but on top of that he's the only person
i've ever seen
who put tremendous years of effort into
figuring out what works
you know he's done written books on
these topics so he knows what works with
homeless and with drug addiction because
he looked at all the things that people
have tried
and he knows that what california is
doing is in the is on the category of
things which have been tried and fail
so he wants to try things that are in
the category of things that have been
tried and were greatly successful
how crazy is that
[Laughter]
so
uh this is really interesting what
happens if somebody has the the total
skill stack
from communication writing
political
you know knowledge
he's an expert on now addiction an
expert on homelessness by virtue of
having studied it for writing books
uh an expert on energy of nuclear power
climate change
and even forest management
so there's not a single topic that
matters in california
that michael schellenberger doesn't know
twice as much as the current governor
think about that
and this is a demonstrated fact i'm not
just saying oh he's smart i think he's
just smarter it's not that
i'm saying you could just look at the
documented
life of both people
and you can see that schellenberger has
done deep dives and super productive
activist stuff
like talked to congress a number of
times talk to other other governments i
mean he's persuading governments at the
highest level
about
things that are
you know deeply important to the world
so he's got his priorities right he's
got the skill set that i've never seen
honestly
let me say this i've never seen
anybody enter politics
with as good a skill set as he's
bringing
like the right set of talents that all
that all stack just right
you take anybody you take uh trump
you know i was obviously pro-trump
but even trump doesn't have expertise in
all these categories right imagine if he
did
imagine trump with his other skills
but also having all the you know the
deep dive
uh analytical ability of a
schellenberger i mean
that's an endless possibility but you
don't have to imagine that
because you can just look at
schallenberger because he actually has
those skills he he has everything from
the persuasion to the communication
to
insanely high energy i don't know how it
gets so much done you need somebody with
high energy in politics
and yes good hair
i always make fun of that you can't
really get elected unless you have good
hair he has great hair
let's not let's not
underestimate the hair
so there you go keep an eye on
california we might be going from a bad
situation to a good situation
and at least we have a good choice which
i don't think we've ever had before
and
you should follow michael schallenberger
if you want to know any solutions for
anything from
drug addiction to homeless to
nuclear energy to
crime
basically all of it
he's done pretty much a deep dive on
everything that matters in california
so
what do you think does he have a chance
he is going to have some powerful people
behind him
i'm 100 behind him
anybody who thinks he doesn't have a
chance i think you're coming from the
political parties have all the power
perspective
you probably didn't think
uh
that's interesting you you probably
didn't think
that he could move the dial on nuclear
power didn't you
did you think anybody could do that
do you think anybody could enter the
conversation and just move the dial
on nuclear power
he did
he did that i mean you watched it you
watched it in real time i kind of i did
the play-by-play for years watching him
do his work and he did it
musk should endorse schellenberger
oh there's an idea
yeah imagine if elon musk backed michael
schellenberger and did it publicly
wow
because i don't think there would be
even one speck of difference between
musk's opinion
on political stuff
and sheldenberg's i'll bet i'll bet they
don't have one difference of opinion
because at a certain level of awareness
everybody has the same opinion
i hate to tell you
but at a certain level of understanding
of how the world works
all the opinions are the same
trust me they're all the same at a
certain at a certain point
could could tesla come back to
california now that's a big ask
and i think taxes will be the
big problem there
all right
um
i am going to uh go do something else
and uh i think you'd agree this is the
best live stream of all time of all time
it's just getting better this is the
only live stream in which we
intentionally try to change the world
and succeed
okay maybe others do that too
but i don't know about them and that's
the same thing
so
channeling muhammad ali i don't know
that reference
in this context
number 666 my episode 666 was still the
best i was normal then
before i became abnormal
oh it'll be better tomorrow
wait you have a question
yes it's the best ever the best ever all
right that's it for now and i will
talk to you all tomorrow on youtube
