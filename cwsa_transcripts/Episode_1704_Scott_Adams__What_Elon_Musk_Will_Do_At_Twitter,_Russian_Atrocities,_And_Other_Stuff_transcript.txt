one moment it looks like my printer
might work after all hold on
this can be exciting
well i have to tell you
that like a technical stud that i am
i changed my
mesh network yesterday
which means that all my devices
don't know what my network is but
they're learning
so
today we'll be going for the back-up
plan but not until the simultaneous sep
and all you need for that is a copper
margarita class of tanker tells us time
to canteen geographic vessel of any kind
[Music]
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's called the dopamine of the
day and it's called the simultaneous
step it's going to happen now
go
oh yeah
oh yeah
let's take a vote how many of you would
like to see me raise my printer above my
head
and throw it vigorously onto the ground
on the tile floor
breaking into a million shards
which i will then have to walk uh
walk through with my bare feet
no i'm seeing lots of no's
this is this actually tells a lot about
my audience
half of you want me to destroy an
expensive piece of equipment in front of
your eyes and half of you say no
we don't want to start the morning that
way
well
let's see let's let's leave it to
fate
oh good
my my backup plan actually works so
we're so the printer has one more chance
now i'm not going to blame the printer
this time because it could be user error
normally you have to teach the
technology
uh how to behave
because that's that really sets the
lessons from the other technology
you know a lot of you believe that if
you break one piece of technology
in front of the other devices that has
no effect
because you think to yourself well those
are the devices they're not ascension
they have no idea that you've just
destroyed another piece of equipment how
is that going to affect them
well you don't understand how the
simulation works
the simulation
will rewrite itself
if you make it
all right um
here's a story that i think is
interesting so michael shellenberger as
you know is running for governor
and interestingly he's running as an
independent
now the first thing you should say to
yourself is
independents never win
am i right
i mean they have jesse ventura but it's
very unusual now
have you ever noticed there's that
there's a
theme or a commonality to independent
candidates
what is it that independent candidates
generally have in common with each other
in the comments what do you know what do
they usually have in common with each
other
they're not very good candidates
can can you tell me one
give me an example of one independent
candidate
who had the the full uh the full stack
well jesse ventura came pretty close and
he got
elected and yeah trump well you could
say that trump was sort of an outlier so
here's
here's the pattern you should look at
if you're looking at the pattern that
independents don't win
that's the wrong pattern
the pattern you should look at is that
good candidates always win
that's the pattern
the best candidate almost always wins
or at least they're you know neck and
neck they might lose by one percent but
the best candidate doesn't come in last
it doesn't matter what party they run
the best candidate is going to make a
big show
so i think what's different about
schellenberger is he's the first full
stack
political candidate i've ever seen
now do you know do you know what i mean
by a full stack it comes from
programming language there are
programmers who know not just
one programming language but they might
know everything from you know the
hardware to
user interfaces just just every
component of
development
if somebody has all of those skills
which is sort of rare
finding a quote full stack developer
is sort of like a finding a unicorn
but if you find one
they're they're worth their weight in
gold because they're so rare
now in the political world what would a
full stack candidate look like not ross
perot
ross bro has the uh
has the problem that he sounds like uh
i don't know
he sounds like a small rodent
who's been caught in some kind of a
deadly trap
right he was short
he was unattractive
and he had a weird voice
he wasn't really a full stack candidate
he was just a candidate who had some
solidly good ideas in retrospect they
were good ideas
and
now take take shellenberger
good looking
perfect hair
and he's the only person i know
candidate-wise who's coming uh into the
process having never been a political uh
you know official he's coming into the
process with
books full of specific solutions for the
biggest problems in california
he's actually looked at all the things
you can do
and figure out what are the good ones
who the hell else has ever done that
i mean seriously
who else can communicate so well that
they can write best-selling books all
day long
can understand the the
the technology and the complexity of
very complicated things
and and simplify it to the point where
the public can understand it
perfectly knows the most important
policies or issues he's not spending his
time i don't think i've heard him speak
correct me if i'm wrong all right here
give me a fact check
have you ever heard michael
schellenberger weigh in on any wokeness
stuff
not pro or con right
i mean i'm i'm sure he'll have to answer
it because he's a candidate but i feel
like it's his lowest priority
because it doesn't seem to be anywhere
near the top of anything he talks about
can you make if you're going to design a
perfect candidate on paper
this is the first
i'm going to say this and i don't know
that is true
but if anybody has a better example of
it i'd love to hear it
my
my contention is that schellenberger is
the first
full stack candidate
the first one
he's even a full stack in terms of a
little bit democrat and a little bit
republican
meaning that he was a registered
democrat for years
decided that some of their solutions
didn't kind of work
wasn't really willing to be a republican
but clearly understands that some of the
republican opinions make sense nuclear
energy being
chief among them
so where else have you ever gotten a
candidate
who had everything from full detailed
policy understanding ability to
communicate it
the the physicality of you know a
candidate because people are are
influenced by just how tall you are and
how your hair looks it's just true i
mean i'm not saying it's a good thing
it's just true
um
yeah so the only thing he lacks is maybe
finance finances because that's the
problem being an independent
but who are we talking about
who's the other person running for
governor
name the other person running for
governor any any other person
name one other person running for
governor in california
am i right
does he need money
does he need money if you don't even
know the name of the person he's running
against or names
of people
is it newsom
you don't know that do you
are you sure newsome is going to run for
governor and not president
i don't think we know any of that
but if if it came down to let's say
newsome versus sheldenberger
would he need money
because the publicity alone would be
insane i mean it's the perfect matchup
of the sort of uh mtsu governor versus
the full stack candidate
don't you want to see the the empty suit
versus the full stack
everybody wants to see that that's like
the best show ever
i would watch their debates
like i would watch entertainment to me
that would just be like an entertaining
show
all right biden says now he wants to try
putin as a war criminal
taking it to the next level not just
saying he is one sort of but
getting serious about it
now i saw joel pollack's opinion
that that could be making things worse
if you ever hope to have a negotiated
outcome
it's pretty hard to have a negotiated
outcome with somebody you've labeled as
a war criminal that you plan to
put on trial now there's no real risk
that
putin will be on trial because i don't
think russia buys into the
you know the the process any more than
the united states does
but it's it's good
persuasion
unless
it causes putin to dig in
but here's the real question
isn't putin already all in
is there any more in he could be
i mean he's fighting for his life in a
sense
um
and i think i think putin's all in i
think he's just going to do whatever it
takes and as long as it takes and
however many people he kills
and i don't think that anything will
happen to him more crime wise so
this is the sort of thing you could
imagine would move the needle
and make us a lot more dangerous
but my my personal view is that putin's
already a 10 out of 10
for danger
i don't think he's going to go to
nuclear because that doesn't work for
him
and he's still winning
winning and winning in the sense
i think that putin will still be in
charge of russia when this is all done
russia's economy might be quite degraded
by then but i'll bet his popularity will
be high
his personal life will be great he'll be
seen as a hero eventually if not right
away because he can control the
media
so
to me it looks like he's nowhere near
losing
so i'm not too worried about the war
crimes thing because you know all that
really does is says it's going to be
hard for him to travel i guess
and get any respect in the world i do
think that putin is done as a respected
leader if he ever was i suppose that's a
matter of opinion but don't you think
that he will no longer be invited
to anything unless they need unless they
need his energy in which case if they
need his energy then they'll go right
back to normal as soon as they can yeah
yeah i will buy your energy
well
speaking of russian atrocities
so it does appear there's more and more
evidence that the russians are
committing war crimes
but let me ask you this
name the war that didn't have any war
crimes on both sides
do you think there's ever been one
do you believe there's ever been a war
like a serious war
where there weren't war crimes on both
sides
do you remember all the war crimes that
the americans committed in world war ii
you don't do ya
i i can tell you that i've personally i
personally uh spoke to someone
who's no longer with us you know he's
passed away but i personally spoke to
someone who was involved in a war crowd
a big one
uh where they lined up the german
the germans and just killed them all and
of revenge they were mad
that really happened
now i'm not going to give the details
because i don't want you to know who it
was
but
a real person who was really there at
you know during the
the the the crush
across the
europe to end germans germany's run so
he was there he was in the middle of the
action and he was personally involved in
a massacre of uh captured german
soldiers
at the end of the war
it was the end of the war
and they killed them anyway
now did you ever hear about that war
crime
no because do you know why do you know
why the americans murdered
the germans
because they discovered that the germans
had committed a war crime
they found
literally hot evidence meaning the
bodies were still warm
so the germans had just massacred a
bunch of captured prisoners
and then the americans captured the
people who had just murdered the
captured american prisoners
how do you think that went
the bodies were still fresh
they had just been murdered
and that's when the americans you know
captured the situation and captured all
the germans
do you know what the uh
do you know what the
most chilling sentence i've ever heard
it came from this individual
and i asked him one time did in world
war ii did you take prisoners
because to me it seemed unlikely
to me it seemed that taking prisoners
when you're you know marching across
europe would slow you down wouldn't it
and why would they want to be slowed
down
my assumption was they just murdered all
their prisoners
i don't know that
but i'm just thinking from a practical
perspective they probably murdered their
prisoners
and so i asked him about his experience
and he said you know did you actually
capture
germans and then take care of them
and like everything was fine
and he said oh yeah yeah yeah yet he
told the story about capturing one
particular german soldier
and the german soldier was
friendly basically because he was caught
and you know
the war was
winding down
and he wasn't posing any danger
and they just had sort of a friendly
interaction with him
right you i think he was an officer but
they had a
somewhat professional interaction
just took him prisoner he said yeah he
had no problem we just took him prisoner
it was nothing
then i kept asking him because i was a
little skeptical that they really took
prisoners
and then he told me this story
about liberating a german prisoner of
war camp
and finding and they looked for the
prisoners and they couldn't find them
and they said where are all the
prisoners
and finally somebody pointed to a train
i guess there was a train that went
through the were next to the
the camp
they opened up the doors of the the
train
and all of the dead
recently machine gunned
prisoners fell out
dead
they had put them in the trains to take
them away because the you know the
american forces were coming they were
going to remove them but they didn't
have time
so instead
they machine-gunned it
and so
as the person i was talking to described
this he said and we opened up you know
the train cars and the bodies of the
americans just fell out
they had been machine gunned
and then i heard the most chilling
sentence i've ever heard
and he looked at me and he said
that day
we didn't take prisoners
that day we didn't take prisoners
that was world war two
you know the good one where everybody
was awesome and and there was good and
evil and we were the good guys and they
were the bad guys
it's war
it's war
right
there's no such thing as an atrocity in
a war because it's all
atrocity here's something that really
 pisses me off
that you can watch scenes of adult men
ripped apart by shrapnel and god knows
what and you go oh that's just war
that's just war but then you see a
civilian
dead on the street that's an atrocity
that's an atrocity
no it's all atrocity it's
atrocity from top to bottom there's no
non-fucking atrocities
in war
we just have people that we don't give a
 about
it's called adult men
we don't give a
about adult men no matter how many of
them die we say well that was a war
how'd the war turn out
who won the war but as soon as somebody
who's not an adult man dies gets
a goddamn splinter it's a war
crime
not cool
not cool
it's either all war crimes or there's no
war crimes you if you think that
some of them are good deaths and some of
them are bad ones
 all of you who think that like i
don't even care about the bodies
piling up because they're just an
example
of a larger evil
the reason i don't care is not because i
don't have empathy the opposite is the
opposite
my empathy is much greater than that
because i have an empathy for the
 soldiers
what about the soldiers
we don't care about the soldiers
right
we talk about oh there were a thousand
civilian deaths a tragedy a tragedy
probably under counted
but we're talking about tens of
thousands of adult men getting ripped
apart even the ones who don't die are
never gonna be the same the ones who
don't even get wounded are never gonna
be the same
every man in that battle is
destroyed
they're all wounded
all of them they're all wounded they're
not coming back
they're not coming back the same and
there are millions of them
 millions of them
yeah let's talk about the the picture of
the little uh toddler who died on the
beach tragedy
not minimizing it
but why do we pick and choose like oh
that's an atrocity
that's a work right oh that's just
that's just a battle
it's just a battle
all right here's what the soviets have
done and the russians have done
according to peter bergen and cnn
these are just some of the things
they've done um
and the soviet union killed over a
million afghan
civilians a million
the soviet union killed a million
civilians in afghanistan
uh russia's first war in chechnya in
1994
25 000 civilians died in just two months
of fighting in in grozny the capital
during the second russian war in
chechnya
uh russian soldiers summarily executed
at least 38 civilians in grozny
and february 5th 2000 russian soldiers
summarily executed at least
60 civilians now this of course is
according to
various human rights groups so i don't
know how to i really don't know how to
assess the validity of them
um but peter bergen thinks they're real
it's on cnn the international federation
of human rights found the russians and
cheshia
engaged in summary executions murders
physical abuse tortures etc
to which i
say it was a war
it was a war do you know who's left out
how about the adult men who died
it's not even a statistic
not even a statistic it's not even in
the story
don't even care oh adult men yeah just
go die
and we'll we'll make news out of it
we'll get some content out of it
i didn't expect to be so angry this
morning but i think it was my printer
i think my printer got me off to a bad
store
so the u.s
um the all these financial sanctions
stories get a little complicated let's
see if i can make this simple
but uh
russia has you know lots of rubles that
has its own currency but it also has to
hold on to a reserve of american dollars
because some things need to be paid for
in american dollars
one of those things is a whole bunch of
debt
that
russia has and america somehow with
their financial engineering
made it impossible for them to pay repay
their debt with dollars
because i guess we um somehow
somehow we blocked their access to the
dollars that they owned
don't know how we did that
through the banking system presumably
and
so um
that's going to push moscow into either
default under loans
which is a pretty big problem
or
given that their us dollars are limited
apparently that's how they buy weapons
so russia can't fund its war not weapons
so much i guess they make their own
weapons but in terms of funding their
war they need us dollars
is that weird
do you believe that russia can't fund
their own war
when they're a weapons manufacturing
country and they've got their own
currency that they can't do it without
the dollar
i don't know i'd like to hear some
details on that but there must be
something that they buy internationally
that is required to keep the army
running
what is that and who's selling it to
them and why do they only take dollars
i don't know i have some questions about
that um
all right most important thing that's
happening today is as you know elon musk
bought
over nine percent of twitter which makes
him by far the biggest stockholder
and today he was granted a seat on the
twitter
board
now
uh let's look at some context
i always thought it was smart when jeff
bezos bought the washington post
because if you're a billionaire
you want to be able to control the
narrative
right because big news affects you
because you're a big player in the world
and so it just makes sense that if a
billionaire can buy
a financial organ
they should do it
they should do it because it gives them
some control over the narrative and the
washington post
like the new york times are the the
papers of record so to speak so if it's
in one of those papers then it's real
if it's in some smaller publication well
it might be real it might not be but
yeah
so
and i also love the competition
between
elon musk and jeff bezos
so they're both they both got rocket
companies
both trying to be the richest person
and so far elon's rockets are better
than uh
is it blue horizon is better than bezos
rockets
but i think musk just topped him on
media control as well
because bezos bought the washington post
which
sort of a
i don't know a dying industry in a way
whereas i would argue that having some
kind of influence on twitter and i think
musk will have a lot
is a bigger play
it's a better play
so i i think that in the battle of the
uh the billionaires
i think elon musk has got a better play
because if you're gonna if you're gonna
try to control the consciousness of the
world
twitter is how you get to all the
reporters
all the journalists are on twitter
but not everybody reads the washington
post
so i feel like he found the right the
right lever you know the right choke
point for
influence now given that elon musk is
not about uh so much about
his own message versus free speech
he seems pretty consistent about that
um
i i think that you're going to see a
free speech model coming here and it'll
be interesting now that he has a board
seat
what do we expect
well
first of all if i worked in the
marketing department of twitter
i would be very worried right now
because elon musk is now replacing
everything that the marketing department
does for twitter
am i right the the twitter stock went up
27 or something
well that's what marketing's supposed to
do right they're supposed to get that
get that uh excitement up
and
so i think you know elon just tweeting
and and being on the board and buying
stock and
doing whatever he's going to do next
which will also be interesting i'm sure
uh you don't even need marketing anymore
you just fire the whole marketing
department
here's what i want to see more than
anything and we might actually see this
if elon musk gets enough influence at
twitter and a board member is pretty
influential especially if you're the
biggest
uh biggest shareholder too
do you think that elon musk could get a
meeting with
the top engineer in charge of the
algorithm at twitter
of course he could
of course he could
how much would you like to see that
broadcast or live streamed
a lot right
because here's the thing that's
different about elon musk imagine
imagine any ordinary
board member talking to an engineer
about the algorithm it would go like
this
hey engineer can you tell me what's in
that algorithm
then the engineer says
blah blah blah something technical
and then the board member says well i'm
not i'm not getting that can you
simplify that
blah blah blah something even more
technical
and eventually the board member goes i
can't understand it i guess i give up
right that's probably the way the only
way it could go because nobody can
really get under the hood unless the
engineer wants them to otherwise you're
just going to hear some blah blah blah
go away not knowing what happened
but imagine the elon musk talking to the
top engineer and the engineer gives him
some
how does that go
i mean really
really imagine elon musk talking to the
person who understands best
twitter's algorithm
and asking him to explain
you know how it works etc and then
imagine that engineer trying to
him
how long is that going to last right
he's like the only person you couldn't
 on this question well there are
others but there are not others who
would actually buy the company and get a
board seat and
and start digging into it
but the the scariest thing about elon is
how much he understands
that's the scary part it's not even the
billions it's the fact that if if they
let him under the hood he can see what's
going on
maybe you and i couldn't
right we don't necessarily have those
skills but the skill that musk brings to
this
i think he can look at the algorithm and
figure out what's going on
now i do think here's my prediction
that the algorithm is too complicated
for anybody to understand
but i'll bet that's going to change
and
i think that musk is going is likely to
implement jack dorsey's plan
that for whatever reason jack dorsey
didn't get done i imagine there was
internal dissent
but
but i think that musk could probably
push it through and that would be to
have a user choice on which filter or
algorithm you use you choose the one
that gives you everything you got
everything
so i think that's where it's going to go
because that's really the the most
rational way to go
and i i would expect elon to go a
rational direction
now what about the question of twitter
amnesty what do you think of that do you
think that twitter should consider some
process
for bringing back people who have been
banned for life
um i think so i think so now i i'm not
opposed to bannon
i just think there needs to be a time
limit
um because if you do something you know
mildly
naughty
uh maybe you give 48 hours time out or
something just enough to just enough to
get your attention doesn't really have
any effect on your business
no effect on your brand nothing it just
gets your attention 48 hours
but then there are things that are just
worse right you know calling for
violence in some credible way something
like that
but those people too i think should have
access to social media eventually
but maybe you give them a five-year
timeout or a three-year
whatever that's the right number and
just say all right you got three years
if you come back we're going to watch
you
because we're going to watch you
carefully because you had trouble
if you're if you're fine for the next
few months
you know we'll stop watching you
something like that
now don't you think they could have some
kind of an amnesty policy that just
had some kind of clarity on it that you
could get out of jail eventually
i think so
uh
what's that
when you're convicted because what you
posted was actually illegal
was that true
all right um
so maybe that'll happen all right the
shanghai situation is getting pretty bad
25 million people in lockdown
some are tweeting that they have no
access to food or water in some cases
because the distribution to 25 million
people locked up is pretty challenging
even for china who's pretty good at
stuff
and
i saw a tweet that
usually there are a hundred ships backed
up in shanghai at the ports but now
they're 300.
uh-oh
the two biggest problems in the world
are
uh
probably china locking down and and
affecting the supply chain
and
secondly fertilizer
i think fertilizer is going to be the
big problem because apparently you need
petrochemicals to make
fertilizer and if you don't have and
have petrochemicals you can't do
anything you can't make plastic
fertilizers
civilization will start to decline
so
those are things i worry about i worry
about supply chain and fertilizer
i worry less about availability of
energy i think we could work that out
but the cost of it
is going to be crazy
so maybe what will come out of this is
some maybe alternative way to fertilize
maybe
maybe indoor growing is how you get away
with less fertilizer is that one way to
do it i don't know
well you could get away with less
pesticides i guess fewer pesticides
uh
john stewart as you know has come back
in the scene and he's doing a
sort of a serious show about you know
the big problems in the world
uh
but
he he went hard at uh at the question of
systemic racism with i guess cory booker
he couldn't even get corey booker to go
as far as he was going in
hating white people for their
their uh
their uh racism
so
here's the thing
i agree with jon stewart that systemic
racism exists
but unless he's talking about what to do
about it
why do we need to hear it
what's the point
there are lots of problems that exist
they just can't do a damn thing about
we don't talk about them to death
because there's not a damn thing you can
do about it
but
if jon stewart is not suggesting
specific fixes for stuff
all he's doing is insulting us for a
paycheck
i think
i mean i need some solutions
and i don't know what he's
what exactly has he uh
has he recommended for fixing
systemic racism
right
um wall street journal has an article
that the rate of depression of
middle-aged women is through the roof
but part of it might be
sexism
that's my own interpretation their
interpretation is that some of the
people who are getting antidepressants
the women
might actually be suffering from hormone
fluctuations
that are somewhat normal as they
approach menopause
so we might be giving antidepressants to
women who just have temporary
problems with their
normal natural problems with their uh
hormones as they reach a certain age
that's pretty scary
that's pretty scary
yeah
and and the sexism part is that i
imagine that women are being treated
like men basically
you know if men get an antidepressant
it's probably because they're depressed
if women act sad it could be because
they're depressed in the same way as men
but also it could be a hormone thing
and if they just get treated like men
they're just going to get
antidepressants no matter what they're
complaining about as long as it's
depression related
um
so i think my instinct is that
this is right
um and if you've ever talked to anybody
who had hormone replacement
they're pretty happy with it
let me see in the comments um maybe my
experience is uh
unique
but the only time i've heard of people
getting hormone replacement they were
delighted
and i understand that the risk if you're
over 50 is actually low
um
yeah so i am seeing i'm not seeing
anybody disagree
oh somebody is that is not true
all right
i believe the cancer risk is under 50
but over 50 i just read this today over
50 it actually makes it safer
not less safe
so if you think if you think the cancer
risk is the issue
do an update on that because i think
they found out it is an issue under a
certain age but over an age it's
actually a benefit
but do do a fact check on that because
i'm not so sure about that
um here's the ratio um for so for
women between the ages of 40 and 59
one in five women are on antidepressants
does that sound right to you
do you know any women between the ages
of 40 and 59 and would you say that uh
only 20 of them are on antidepressants
20
that doesn't sound real to me does it
i feel like it's higher
i'm not sure but maybe it's a california
thing but it feels like it's higher
but let me let me add something to this
uh so the wall street journal says one
in five women
in that age range are on antidepressants
in my opinion
it's a hundred percent but not
antidepressants per se
in my experience 100 of adults are
medicating they're self-medicating
they're just doing it differently
some are drinking some are smoking some
we're doing weeds mushrooms god knows
what
but i don't know any adults who aren't
self-medicating
one way or another
so i think this is super misleading when
you say one in five
are using antidepressants the other four
out of five
just don't use those words
do you think they're drinking and doing
drugs because they're so happy all the
time without them
no
they're doing drugs and drinking and
smoking cigarettes because they're
happier with those things
otherwise they wouldn't do it
or at least they think they are
all right what else is going on
i've come to the opinion
uh we need to reframe the climate change
question
because it used to be their climate
change believers who were
following the science and then there
were climate change deniers who were
not following the science
what is it now
i think everybody agrees on the science
now
not everybody of course but at this
point i think it the question of climate
change is completely transformed into
the following categories no longer do we
have people who believe and people who
deny
now we have people who understand
economics
and people who don't
and people haven't realized the shift
yet and i think the the nuclear energy
shift
really highlights that
anybody who understood
both nuclear energy and economics was in
favor of nuclear power for a long time
but it's only recently that democrats
are starting to be a little bit
more vocal about the same thing
so we now have bipartisanship on nuclear
energy
and that's the almost the whole game
right
because nobody likes pollution
everybody likes nuclear energy i mean
i'm exaggerating but on the left and the
right we have plenty of support for now
where we didn't before
and i think this point we just have to
understand
that the people who are uh
who are for let's say aggressive climate
change mitigation
are not climate change believers
they're also that but that's not the
important part the important part is
that they're not good at economics
so what you have is really just two
groups people who understand economics
and people who don't
we don't have climate deniers and
climate
believers
i mean we sort of do but you can see the
shift has really moved from believing
versus not believing the science
to
do you even know how to do economics
because how many of the climate change
people thought that we would run out of
food
if we stopped using petrochemicals do
you think if i talked to the greta and i
said greta
did you know that we'd run out of food
if we get too aggressive on climate
change and that that's worse
than even the whatever catastrophe we
get from warmer or unstable climate
yeah so i don't think she understood
that how many of you knew that
petrochemicals were the were the
actually a raw ingredient to make
fertilizer and there's not really a
better way to do it
how many knew you had to have
petrochemicals to make fertilizer
yeah i mean i knew you needed it to
transport it and to mine it but i didn't
know that uh i didn't actually didn't
know until today that you directly
chemically change the petrochemicals and
gas in particular
uh natural gas into uh fertilizer
components
so and then when you add in the fact
that the developing countries can't
develop you add in the fact that will
probably only be saved by high tac
you know in
some high-tech solution and you don't
get too much high-tech if you don't have
a good economy if you don't have a good
economy unless you've got cheap energy
i don't think that the people who wanted
climate change
understood
what it would cost
i had no idea what it would cost
so i think we just have to stop talking
about climate denial and climate
follow the science and just say
some people understand economics and
some people don't
and that's it
one let me ask you this when was the
last time you saw an economist
on
uh msnbc or cnn
saying you know from an economic
perspective it would be a good idea to
get rid of fossil fuels as quickly as
possible
have you ever seen it
no you see scientists right you always
see a scientist
and the science is a little bit closer
to settled than it ever has been because
remember there are tons of republicans
now
who are willing to say yeah there's it
looks like there's some climate change
but the real question is what you do
about it how aggressive what do you do
and and i think once everybody's on the
page that yeah something's happening
it's really just a what you do about it
then you have to move it to the
economists
so we've got to get climate change away
from the scientists
because they did a good job
you don't want to hear that right
but the entire basis of what i'm saying
is that because the scientists
did a good job
they figured out a problem and they
communicated until enough democrats and
republicans believe that the climate is
getting warmer and the humans are part
of it now i know there are a lot of
people who don't believe it on my
audience
but within the professional you know the
politicians
the politicians
i think the republicans are largely
believe in climate change now wouldn't
you say
give me a fact check
of let's say republicans in
the government
let's just say congress what percentage
of republicans in congress believe that
humans are causing the climate to warm
what percentage of republicans would you
say
i'm saying 25
60 30
i would say 60 to 70.
that's my guess
somebody says 90 and i don't know if
you're wrong
i wouldn't disagree with 90 actually
i wouldn't disagree with 90.
i don't know that's right
i'd say at least 60 percent
i i think a solid majority
now
if you if you still disagree just
remember you're disagreeing with your
own side now
your own side has made a move
fairly dramatically in the last few
years
and i think some of it has to do with
the fact that if if nuclear energy can
be seen as a solution
then i think a lot of republicans are
willing to say there was a problem
you know what i mean
if you're willing if everybody's willing
to go nuclear
then i think the republicans who can say
all right well maybe there's a little
bit of a problem because at least we're
doing something smart
at least that's something
um
yeah so i think that among republicans
they've decided climate change is a real
thing
all right what else we got going on
today
not much
i think we're into bonus territory
what's your side scott i don't know
podcast on racism i'm kind of tired of
racism
aren't you
um one of one of the topics you may
notice that i'm avoiding like the plague
is the disney thing
and don't say gay and everything
i don't know there's just something
about that topic
that's
first of all it's too easy to talk about
it so everybody is and i don't have
anything to add it's just pure opinion
and if your opinion is different than my
opinion well what can i do about that so
the the the disney thing is
um
the disney thing
it just doesn't have any traction for me
like i guess it matters but uh it just
doesn't matter to me
now
have you been to disney lately i can't
figure out
uh how they survive
is it just because there are new stupid
children born every day who don't know
that disney is lame
because
the last time i went to disney i was
struck by how old it looks
like it just looks like
pre-internet
like it all just looks pre-internet and
i'm thinking uh
how is this going to last in the long
run a pre-internet business where it's
just like physical rise and you know
it's a small world after i mean there's
like one of the famous things that's
just like puppets singing it's a small
world while you
ride a boat past it
that's not exactly cutting edge is it
i i'm not sure if i'm talking about
disneyland or disney world or
what but i think they both have the same
situation
for very young children yeah makes sense
but i still see lots of adults who can't
wait to go
all the time i hear adults say oh we
can't wait to go to disney and they use
their kids as an excuse
nostalgia yeah
epcot is better
probably
all right um
is there anything i haven't mentioned
that you desperately want me to
are there any topics
oh let me let me just uh
put a put a bow on the atrocity thing
i don't believe the video of the
atrocities
from bucca the the people who were left
on the street with their hands tied so i
don't believe that's real
i also don't think it makes any
difference
because what i think is happening is
that
fake
atrocities are being faked
because the real ones don't have any
video
that's what i think
i think the reason for faking it for
faking atrocities is number one to get
an advantage right political advantage
but number two
they're probably almost certainly are
real atrocities but nobody has a picture
of it
so if you can't get a picture of the
real ones
is it
is it really unethical
to fake one
what do you think
suppose they knew for sure there were
real atrocities but they can't prove it
so they fake one that's you know video
ready and then the world can see it is
that unethical
i mean it's a war
i'm going to say no
i'm going to say no
it's a lie if you want to say all lies
are unethical then okay
i i mean i would accept that point of
view but in my personal opinion it's war
it's war
yeah it's all atrocity it's all
inappropriate
all of it
so i think it is ethical
it's ethical within the context of war
because it is true
you know you have to use a lie to convey
the truth
now that's what hyperbole is sometimes
too right hyperbole is a lie
that if you do it right and you're doing
it in a somewhat ethical way the lie is
convincing the public of something
that's useful to them and they should
know and you know the world's better off
so um i'm actually
i'm sort of in favor of the faked
atrocities so long as we know that there
are real ones
i think we do know that
because it's war
now do you remember all the video you
saw of the uh ukrainian military
atrocities
did you see any
i saw one video
of some russians claiming
that the ukrainians shelled something
like a residential building but no
evidence it didn't sound didn't look
real to me
yeah so what are what are the chances
that the ukrainians
oh the the leg shooting that's right
yes there was the leg shooting video
you're right
so that looked pretty darn real i don't
know how you could have faked that one
that looked really real
but i also imagined that that sort of
thing is because they've seen some bad
stuff on the other side
you know there's a little bit of that
uh the raped and murdered women
woman with the swastika painted in her
own blood
that doesn't sound real
i mean
that's a little bit too on the nose
that doesn't sound real
um and i'm not doubting that there are
ukrainian nazis
the uh as of or shooting them in the
nuts is that something that's happened
yeah
i don't know what i would do if i were
in actual war and i captured somebody
who had been trying to kill me
i don't know that i could
take a prisoner
i don't know
um
and apparently there's some uh effort by
the ukrainians to do massive phone
callings you know cold calling into
russia
to try to
convince them
convince them to quit the war
so
your mind changes in warrior
hoaxing war crimes is pure manipulation
it's manipulations for sure
but it also might be
weirdly honest
um
how to handle dog owners whose dogs bark
and snarl at your dog
well i could tell you once at the dog
park there was a bigger dog that once
attacked my dog
and
it took me about half a second to go
primitive
and you don't want to get in a fight
with a dog
but i did
i got in a fight with a
the dog lost
and then the owner came over
and i thought i was gonna have to fight
the owner next
but it turns out if you beat up an
owner's dog in front of him he doesn't
want to with you
because he was next
if that guy had made one move toward me
for taking his dog out i mean the dog
survived it's you know it'll be fine
but uh i did kick the out of his
dog to get it off my dog so i did go i
just went
i just went uh primitive on it
and and the owner comes over and i'm
still kicking the out of his dog
and i just turned and looked at the
owner with with your next look
do you know what the your next look is
right you're kicking the out of the
guy's dog and the dog was the dog was
trying to kill my dog
right so i mean it was self-defense
but if you're in the middle of taking a
guy's dog out
and you turn and look at him in the eyes
he's not going to move
he's not going to make a move against
you
he's going to take care of his dog which
he did
so
no it wasn't a pit bull it was just
bigger than my dog
sometimes being a psycho is justified
true enough and by the way i love dogs
so i would never i would never hurt a
dog
except in self-defense
uh would you bring a dog like that to
the dog park well that might be part of
the conversation i had with the owner
you
you you might not be surprised
that the question of should this dog be
in the dog park it came up
it came up
i believe if i recall i told him never
to come back
i believe i banned him from the dog park
[Laughter]
i don't know if he ever came back but
i'm pretty sure i banned him
i didn't have the power to ban him from
the dog park but
i i don't think he'd want to have a
second round with me
i keep your dog out of my effing mouth
[Laughter]
keep your dog's name out of my out of
your mouth
uh
dog bird actually caused the volcanic
eruption in real life was there a
volcanic eruption somewhere i did a
comic about a dog bird trying to
create one
the philippines second most active
volcano tall
erupted on thursday
uh
and then somebody tweeted it
uh tweeted that volcano with my comic i
already do the comic it was dog bird
talking to dilbert
he says dogwood says you didn't believe
me when i said i hacked reality and
acquired godlike powers so i will
demonstrate my powers by making a long
dormant volcano erupt in elbonia's
biggest city
and then dilbert says couldn't you use
your powers to do something good instead
and dogberry says too late this is on
you
so it wasn't albonia but
all right
um
uh do i get royalties when harvard
business review uses dilbert in its
magazines
uh probably yes so the process is that
um a publication would contact my
syndication company and they would make
a deal they wouldn't involve me so they
they would say yes or no without without
my direct involvement
but an organization like the harvard
business review
would be fairly careful about copyrights
so while i can't answer the questions
specifically
i would say the odds of it not being
licensed are low
because that's the kind of publication
that would make sure they did it right
how much have you made with dilbert well
you want a dollar amount
twitter's a 52.
um ten and two year rates oh yeah it's
not looking good
all right i think we've uh said
everything we need to say here and uh
did you see my madonna joke
apparently my madonna tweet uh made it
into the daily wire
there was a article in the daily wire
about uh
people's reactions to madonna and she's
the tick tock video
where she gets close to this camera and
her big old uh
lips around like a kiss
and
i i tweeted that madonna is turning into
jar jar binks and nobody's talking about
it
now i tried that joke out with some
people who didn't know who jar jar binks
is
this joke only goes two ways
number one if you don't know who jar jar
binks is nothing
nothing
if you do know who jar jar binks is it's
pretty funny if you've seen the tick
tock video trust me
trust me if you've seen the madonna
video and you know who jar jar binks is
you're gonna be laughing
if you don't know so much
all right
uh scott are you a libertarian i'm not
no i i used to say that i was a
libertarian but without the crazy parts
and then people would say well what are
the crazy parts and i'd have to admit it
was all of it
yeah that's what i used to say before i
used to say i'm left to bernie
because i keep trying to make
a space for myself that doesn't exist
so that nobody knows what i am i mean i
do it intentionally so when i say i'm a
libertarian but without the crazy parts
is similar to when i say
uh i'm left to bernie but better at math
it literally doesn't mean anything
that's what it's supposed to be it's
supposed to just make you say i don't
know
what does he believe
that's exactly where i want to be
uh yeah there are a lot of people who
inhabit a space that doesn't exist
politically but they don't do what i do
in public
um
all right and uh youtube thanks for
joining
and hit that subscribe button if you
haven't
i probably should say that more often
i feel bad that
what's his name uh russell brand has
like millions of
subscribers
don't i deserve at least a million
youtube
come on
i deserve at least a million yeah
russell brand has 4.5 million
subscribers at least a million
just one million that's all i ask
because i believe my content is better
than russell brands except his is more
entertaining
he does have that over me
but i think mine is smarter
according to me
all right that's all for now
uh yeah he is better than me i'll give
him that
yep
i hate to admit it i hate it when
somebody does the same job i do and i
just have to admit they're better it's
like uh
bill waterson
cartoonist for calvin and hobbes
i i want to be able to argue that i was
a am or was a better cartoonist
but i'm not and i won't be
he's just better
so sometimes you just have to accept it
that's right erica i'm just different
i'm different i'm not worse i'm just
different
he described larry flint as be healed be
wheeled
his verbal skills are crazy just off the
charts
all right um
and that's all for now youtube and i'll
talk to you tomorrow i love you all
