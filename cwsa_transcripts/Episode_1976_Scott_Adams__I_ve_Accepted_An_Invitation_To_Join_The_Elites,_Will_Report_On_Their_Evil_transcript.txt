up
well this morning the technology on the
locals platform is glitching
uh am I glitching on YouTube as well
because otherwise if I am there's no
show this morning
how's our how's our sound and how's our
picture
all right I just told all the locals
people to give up on locals for this
morning and to come over here
looks like we're good over here
all right
uh
so I guess we'll just have to wing it
with one with one feed today okay I'm
gonna wait a minute for the people on
locals to come on over I should probably
I need to tell them if I don't tell them
they won't come over
bear with me technical problems two
minutes before going live
so typical
interesting
I can't figure out how to post on locals
you'd think that would be the most
obvious thing I could do since I
literally do it three times a day yet
there's no prompt for posting
that's so weird I have the locals thing
called up on my computer as far as I
could tell I can't figure out how to how
to post a a new post I do it three times
a day
but I never do it from the browser so I
do it from the app
so apparently I can't post it either
somebody do me a favor and post on
locals that they need to come over to
YouTube and maybe we'll do something
like a show
but to take it up a level all you need
is a cover mug or a glass of tanker
tells us Diana canteen yoga flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine is the day the
thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
ah thank you Sandy I appreciate that
yeah so it might take a minute for
everybody to get over here to YouTube
for today that's why we have two
platforms
do you know how many things are broken
in my house right now
besides the locals platform at the
moment
I've got five plumbing and water related
problems
almost every part of the technology in
my house is broken or needs to be
repaired in some way my car needs
service pretty much everything I own is
broken right now
sign of the times
all right now
let's talk about some news
question
how many of you know about magnesium
and magnesium deficiency in people
and what problems it causes do you all
know
every every few years I get excited that
magnesium is the answer to all of my
problems
and I'll take some magnesium for a while
and then my digestive without being too
graphic let's just say my digestive
system uh
it has some changes that are not ideal
so
I've never really known if they worked
but one of the things that is a problem
if you have low magnesium
is anxiety
did you know that
so apparently magnesium is the biggest
or some say the biggest deficiency in
humans
I'm sure there's a debate on that
but our biggest problem at the moment
is
um too much anxiety
so we've got a whole country that's full
of anxiety and nobody knows why
but we also know
that the mineral that you need to help
prevent it
is the the one we have the least of now
what type of things
will decrease your magnesium
number one vitamin D
did you know that
it could be that if you're taking
vitamin D it's making you healthier in
one way but giving you anxiety if it
reduces your magnesium so apparently
you're supposed to match not match but
you know perhaps of magnesium at the
same time as your vitamin D
how many of you do that
I didn't know until 10 minutes ago
um number two one of the other things
that reduces your magnesium is
prescription meds
I don't know which ones
but since we take more prescription
medicine you know anytime in history
I'm kind of I'm kind of wondering if all
of our problems that seem like new ones
you know where everybody's got anxiety
and depression
it might all be magnesium
it could be that there are several
things about our lifestyle and our
environment that are putting pressure on
our magnesium
I don't know uptake
it might be that
might just be that
so I just put that it also helps asthma
right so asthma is also something that
uh boomed in the last 20 years
adult adult asthma is a new new thing in
terms of how big it is I think it always
existed but adults were not getting
massive amounts of asthma until about 20
years ago there is something in our
lifestyle or environment that changed
magnesium fits every every hypothesis
so so here's the only if you're a
curious person and you care about this
sort of thing
just do 10 minutes of research to find
out what it looks like if you have a
magnesium deficiency you'll immediately
see that you have like seven of the
symptoms can't sleep bingo
anxiety Bingo depression Bingo right and
you're gonna say is that a coincidence
is a coincidence that all of the
problems and and asthma is a coincidence
that all of the problems that are
unexplained
and somewhat recent
happened to map exactly the decrease in
our magnesium is that a coincidence
because it looks like it's direct it's
it's just a direct
correlation
so I don't know if it's causation but
you might want to do your own research
on that and I saw somebody suggest
there are at least three or four kinds
of magnesium
and I saw the suggestion just pick one
try it for two weeks
and if it doesn't work you don't notice
any difference try another one but once
you've run through the four that you
could do you know with two weeks a piece
if you don't notice any difference don't
do it
but if you do there you go
well here was an unexpected uh thing
that happened to me I I really honestly
I didn't even think this was real but I
got an invitation to join the elites
have you heard of the elites
they're giving a lot of attention it's
sort of a shadowy group that runs
everything behind the scenes and I I
thought it was just a rumor I didn't
think there were actually any Elites but
I've been invited to join and to entice
me to join they showed me the agenda for
the next meeting and I don't think I'm
supposed to share this with you but
since I haven't yet accepted
I think it's okay so I'm going to tell
you what the elites have on their agenda
let's see first one is uh how to profit
from promoting cannibalism to fight
climate change
okay it's exactly what you would think
number two how to keep Andrew Tate in
The Matrix
okay obviously that's going on
um how to profit from Human misery just
in general
there's another seminar on the many
benefits of War
um
there's a speaker who's tell us why
National borders are imaginary they're
imaginary
uh there's there's going to be some more
speculation about the new mind control
vaccination they're planning to roll out
next year
um there's a conversation I think uh on
the agenda how to make Hunter Biden's
next lost laptop disappear
so they're already already planning for
his next lost laptop and then this one's
a little scary it's uh I'm not sure
exactly what they're referring referring
to but this agenda item is do pure
Bloods taste like chicken
so
I don't know I'd be worried about that
one a little bit
so here's what I'm going to do
I'm gonna I'm gonna join the elites
but I'm going to report back to you
what's happening behind the the scenes
so you'll know you'll no longer have to
wonder what they're talking about
I'll just tell you and
so far their agenda looks pretty pretty
useful
but let's talk about the world economic
forum
um
I saw a tweet today from uh Jordan
Peterson
who was criticizing the world economic
Forum
Etc
and
uh let's see what what did what did
Jordan Peterson say he said
well he thought it was a bad idea to
have this top-down planning
from some big entity that's making
decisions for us
and
here's my Take On The World economic
forum
if Jordan Peterson
which I think you'd all agree is one of
the smartest people in the game and as
far as I can tell is a straight shooter
all the time as far as I can tell right
I'm not magic but but it looks like he's
one of the smartest people looks like he
has good intentions you know he's trying
to make the world a better place it
looks like he tells the truth
every time that I've seen I mean I've
never seen anything that even suggests
he's not being completely forthright so
that so Jordan Peterson is like a huge
huge asset to the world
in my opinion
now Cloud Schwab has a completely
different
educational and experience set
so you've got Jordan Peterson with all
of his
psychology and psychiatric and uh you
know a broad array of related you know
Talent stack sort of things all good
stuff Klaus Schwab is an engineer and an
economist
almost completely different skills than
Jordan Peterson
now if Jordan Peterson and kaleau Schwab
have a disagreement about the wef who
would you trust let's say let's say you
believed just hypothetically they were
both honest so the only thing the only
thing that you're wondering about is who
knew more about the situation like who
who is the smarter person
so who would you trust
so you would trust the person now in my
in my hypothetical they're equal
character I'm not saying they are I'm
saying in a in a hypothetical they're
equal character
but one has the exact background for the
wef and one has
you know a great a great skill set
but unrelated to economics and
Engineering who would you trust
all right here's the test you ready
um you're a business person in a company
so let's let's I'm going to run you
through a little scenario here you work
for a big company
and you have two choices because you've
been in business a long time and you're
a really big company now billions and
billions of dollars
and somebody comes to you and says let's
uh let's tweak our existing systems
to make them better
that's a good idea right
who who would who would be opposed to
tweaking your existing systems to make
them better anybody
would anybody disagree with that hey we
have a bunch of systems in our company
let's tweak them to make them better
it's a true it's a trick question
you don't always tweak them to make them
better you know that right
but tell me see if you can answer this
question because this will this will
determine if you're as smart as Claus
Schwab
because this is an engineering slash
economics
specific question
you've got two choices
tweak your existing systems or rebuild
them from bottom up which one's the
smart one to do
go
do you tweak your systems to make them
better or do you just say all right we
need to rebuild this from the bottom up
go
well if you don't know the answer to the
question you should not have an opinion
if you don't know the answer you should
not have an opinion on cloud Schwab
would you accept that will you accept
that if you can't answer that question
because it's a pretty simple question
should you tweak your systems to make it
better right would you agree that's a
really simple question
and would you agree that if you can't
answer
that simple question you're not
qualified to have an opinion about the
wef would you agree with those
statements
if you can't answer that simple question
should you tweak your systems to make
them better all right
all right now let me tell you the right
answer
most of you said yes you should tweak
your systems to make them better that
proves you do not have the same training
as Klaus Schwab
because it's the wrong answer
nobody had the right answer by the way I
didn't see there might have been
somebody
thank you thank you
thank you one percent the right answer
so far I've only seen one right answer
what system are you talking about that
was the right answer right what I was
what I was going to say is yeah I think
some of you did get the right answer
everybody who said tweak the system
doesn't understand enough
about engineering and economics
to criticize Klaus Schwab
I'm not saying he's right remember I'm
I'm the I'm the guy who talks about both
sides I'm not saying you should follow
him I'm not saying the wef is a good
idea nothing like that I'm saying that
if you think
the system should be tweaked in all
cases then you're not up to the level of
let's say experience and telestack
the cloud Schwab has or I have right you
wouldn't be up to you wouldn't even be
up to my level nor would you be up to
the level of the commenter who said it
depends what a system
that's the right answer right an
engineer would ask that first
I said I asked this generic question
would you tweak a system to make it
better the engineer says which system
because you might want to get rid of
that system
right maybe it just needs to disappear
maybe it's too hard to tweak it because
it you know it's patches on patches on
patches maybe it's better to start a new
one and then when you're confident that
the new one can take over then you get
rid of the old one right if you couldn't
answer the question of should you tweak
a system to make it better with the
complexity that I just added
you probably are not yet at the level
we're criticizing the wef
makes sense now here's where you can
criticism without that knowledge
and here's where I think I would agree
with Jordan Peterson it does depend
who's making the decisions you know we
don't necessarily want to accidentally
create a new world government you know
let's say they get extra power at the
wef you don't want to accidentally have
them more powerful than your own
government
right that that wouldn't be a good
system so there's there's plenty of room
for criticizing the WF
but here's a here's a statement
I believe I wrote it down
uh here's what uh Klaus Schwab believes
about the quote great reset
here's the scariest thing you've ever
heard anybody say all right I'll just
read his words
this is scary
um this is from The Spectator I got this
out of so clauschwa believes that the
world leaves a great reset uh oh what's
that
and it goes on covid according to the
Wes website explaining the global reboot
awaiting the world revealed all of the
so kovid revealed to us that there are
lots of inconsistencies inadequacies and
contradictions of multiple systems from
health and financial to energy and
education would you agree with that
would you agree that covet show the
inadequacies of really all of our
systems
you disagree with that
seriously okay that's not come on
that that wasn't even a question you
were supposed to have a different answer
on
you're not supposed to say no to that
you are you honestly you went through
you went through the pandemic and it
looked like all of our systems were
working perfectly did you notice
anything about the supply chains
how about our decision making of how we
threw money of things did that work out
well Congress make all good decisions
did uh did our governments make good
decisions about masking and vaccinations
did our did our health care System give
you accurate information about the
vaccinations and the masks
if you didn't notice that everything
broke or or not broke but you could see
the weakness in everything because
everything got stressed
so I'll make a general statement if you
stress a system
that's how you find its weaknesses would
you agree with the general statement
they're stressing a system is exactly
what you do to find out where its
weaknesses are now we didn't do it
intentionally kova did but it did stress
our systems and we saw what broke it
what did right now that's what Klaus
Schwab is saying
the coven stressed our systems and it
made it more clear where we need to fix
things so far that's not crazy right
that's not crazy
let's go on the entire planet needs a
new social contract to reshape the
future state of global relations the
direction of national economies the
priorities of societies the nature of
business models and the management of a
Global Commons
what would be the another way to sum up
all of that stuff like it's a bunch of
buzzwords and jargon but that sounds to
me like an engineer who is
the engineers jump in I know their
Engineers watching this he's an engineer
what what does he saying you should do
what's your first step
first step of the reset would be
first step
is this really hard I wasn't expecting
any of these questions to be hard
apparently it is
no the first step is to collect the user
specifications
you're an engineer you find out
what you're trying to accomplish and you
collect you collect the preferences of
the users so he's basically saying we
should relook re-look at everything
you know get get all the input from
everywhere you can get input so you're
as smart as possible
and then see if we should change stuff
well part of that's crazy
you get everybody's input
you do everything in public
you know you you publish the the
speakers and it's all public it's all
transparent
and they're they're collecting user
input about what needs to be changed
how's that evil
now the problem is why is he doing it
like like who elected him right that's a
good conversation it's a good
conversation to say who elected him
like why why would he have this
influence good conversation it's not a
good conversation
to say he shouldn't collect user
specifications to say that the important
people in the country should not be
looking at what's broken and what people
want different that would be crazy talk
somebody needs to be looking at what
broke and what we should do different
maybe it's not them that's a good
conversation
all right
so here's my statement that anybody who
knows both engineering and economics
would agree with
by the way is there anybody on here who
who is well versed in both engineering
and economics
just just go out okay all right uh Edith
is so I'm gonna I'm gonna say for those
of you who are well versed in both
engineering and economics I want you to
see if you agree or disagree with the
following statement
sometimes it makes sense to tweak your
systems
but if the only thing you ever do
is tweak them
and they're complicated right so it's a
complex environment if the only thing
you ever do is tweak them
you will you're doomed
you're doomed if that's the only thing
you do
sometimes you have to rebuild from
scratch
I want every single person who knows
both economics and engineering
to weigh it yes
sometimes you tweak them
sometimes you rebuild them from scratch
and the first thing you do is you figure
out who your team is that would be the
elites because nobody else has power
who are you gonna do put you bring
together the people who have no power
that would make no sense so she was
Klaus Schwab brings together the the
people who can make a decision
he makes sure that the user requirements
of what is broken and everything you
know is is aired
so that we can see the whole process
so
who are they trying to benefit good
question right
so if if they were not doing things that
are pretty transparent
then the urgency of that question would
be much higher
but so far everything seems to be by
necessity transparent
and by necessity I mean the entire
purpose is that when they figure out
what they think is a good idea they
publish it
right their their their business model
is not to hide information
their entire purpose is to create
opinions and put them out there so you
can see them so
as far as I know
they're not dealing with Secrets they're
dealing with a very explicitly they want
the entire public to pay attention to
everything they do don't you think the
world economic Forum wants everybody
watching
and they want they want you to see every
speech and every document
in fact they have people whose job it is
to make sure that everybody sees those
documents and everybody knows what
they're talking about
if any of this were like totally behind
closed doors
yeah and and by the way there are enough
of these so-called Elites
that at least some of them are Elon Musk
right remember he was invited but he
declined because he said it'd be boring
those rooms is going to tell you what
happened
do you think all the elites are on the
same page
no there's not a chance the elites are
competitors with each other somebody is
going to tell you what happened in the
room
because they don't like it if that were
the case
now
all right
how many of you watching this say that I
just defended the world economic Forum
go
who believes I just defended the world
economic forum and thus I'm in favor of
their existence and all the things they
do
now this here's one
now look at the answers those are the
correct answers no
I maintained I have the smartest
audience
like I actually believe that like that I
know it sounds like something you would
just say but I actually literally
believe that because most of you have
gone through the work
so to speak of you know putting up with
me for a while
and we talk about this stuff all the
time all right so here's your lesson for
the day
if you're an engineer or an economist
you are always looking at your systems
and saying do we change it at all if we
do change it do we tweak it
and if we tweak it forever
that's we're doomed at some point the
tweaking becomes too much patch on patch
and you've got to just start over that's
what the world of economic forum is
teaching you but it's hard to learn if
you don't have that background all right
now do you think that Dr Jordan Peterson
has a sufficient understanding of
engineering and economics because he is
a polymath right he's not really limited
to one field he's smart enough that he's
got a he's got at least you know one
foot in anything important I would think
so do you think he has he has enough
background
to make that distinction that sometimes
you do need to tweak and sometimes you
need to go bottom up
I don't know
I I don't I haven't heard him
specifically criticize that point he is
usually about who's you know who's
making the decisions and uh on that on
that front he and I I think we agree
I think we agree that the question of
who makes the decisions is super
important
but here's the problem
there's no right answer
to who makes the decisions
because whoever it is if they're if
they're unelected and if it's a assuming
it's a global thing nobody's going to
get elected right because we don't
really have a global election system so
we don't really have an obvious way to
fix it
so that we would be happy that the
people who are considering these
questions which do have to be considered
we want them to be on our side
but how can we guarantee that
we can't the only thing we can get well
the only thing we could let's say demand
is transparency
and you know then if you see something
you don't like then you know fight like
hell do you know why we don't have a
mandatory vaccinations right now
do you know why we don't have mandatory
vaccinations right now
there's only one reason
there's exactly one reason what is it
transparency yeah there was enough
transparency
that the public said I don't think your
data is convincing me
and that was enough that the public
simply took power
if the government had all the power over
the citizens we would all be vaccinated
agree or disagree I mean unless you hid
in the cave or went on the wild agree or
disagree if it were the government's
decision it would be mandatory agree
yeah I think that's clear because the
government was very clear that it was
in in their opinion it was better for
you and everybody right
so who had the power in the United
States
who had the power the citizens did and
you see that over and over again
now let me ask the second question I
know you're going to get this one right
why do the citizens of the United States
have power but the citizens of Australia
are slaves
you know the answer
why
guns yeah guns it really is that simple
the the citizens of the United States
were not going to take that's who
we are
that's sort of like an identity right
now that your identity and your I don't
know you're it's I don't know if it's a
culture or just an identity but
Americans are very clear that their
government is not in control
true true or false Americans believe and
they act like it that the government's
not in control
how about Canada
about that trucker movement
is the government of Canada in control
or the citizens of uh in control
it looks like the government doesn't
why is the government in control in
Canada
not the citizens
I can think of two reasons
Canada doesn't have enough
not enough guns
now I'm not saying gun owners are
 those are separate categories
I'm saying that sometimes you need a lot
of to get anything done you
need people who are just willing to
I hate to say storm the capital
let me say I'm going to say it right out
loud
I'm going to say it is clearly as you
could possibly say it I am delighted
that January 6 happened
does anybody else have the same opinion
no I I don't condone violence that's all
tragic and I wasn't there and I wouldn't
have gone like it wasn't something I
would have done so and I think that
people were misled there you know every
problem with it right every problem is
valid
but do you want to live in the country
where 40 of the country genuinely
believed I'm not saying it's true but
they genuinely believe the the election
had been rigged
let me ask you this
what did you want them to do I know what
I wanted them to do I mean after the
fact I didn't want it ahead of the fact
after the fact you know once I'm
understanding how everybody felt about
everything I think
you had to you had to do that
you had to put pressure on the
government
now I think it was ill-informed maybe
didn't give us a better outcome but no I
do not want to live in the country where
where the citizens will not
occupy the capital if they get
sorry
I didn't go very far without using that
word did I
I was really going to try hard I didn't
make it one day
so uh here's my Nuance for the day
you can hate a lot of the things the
individual actors did on January 6. you
can hate the the individual characters
both on the government side and also on
the protester side there's plenty of
people who did things you wish they
hadn't done
but you tell me do you want to live in
the country where that wouldn't happen
that's the country I want I aggressively
want that country I super super want
that country I have no ambiguity about
that whatsoever I'll take I'll take the
I'll take the cost to get the benefit
you know was it worth it that people
died
and people were injured maybe
permanently was it worth it
yes
yes it was
yeah it's tragic nobody is happy about
the bad stuff that happened
but we absolutely have to demonstrate
that we're going to get out of our out
of our houses and out of our chairs and
we're going to be in the street
if you mess with us
and I think the election is a clear case
where the people in charge were messing
with us I don't know I mean I'm not
saying the election was rigged I don't
see that evidence you know clearly
but they were messing with us and there
had to be a reaction
so there you go so wef um
my bottom line is uh what they what they
State they want to do is vitally
important and smart
the way they're doing it is certainly
available for criticism like anything
right but as long as they keep the
transparency up I'm probably going to be
reluctantly
open-minded about it
I think the the opportunity for Mischief
is really high
is really high so your suspicion about
the wef
totally support it
can we can we be cool with that because
I know a lot of you think you disagree
with me on the WF but a lot of it is
that I like to show both sides of things
so that could be misleading I'm
completely on your side of not trusting
them
good okay can we just agree on that
but I will fight vigorously for the uh
process which they describe and the
process they describe is you bring the
people in power together
you say maybe this is a time where we
look at rebuilding some systems you you
gather the specifications you do you do
it as publicly as you possibly can and
they I think they do a good job of doing
it publicly and then you let the public
debate it
right you're you're not here's the thing
people miss
you imagine that the WF is going to make
a decision and then it'll just get
implemented
but the public is part of the process
right completely part of the process so
maybe some other country like Australia
will just have to do with the WF tells
them but we won't America won't America
is going to look at it and we're going
to fight like hell like we always do and
we'll we'll sort it out and maybe maybe
WF comes up with an idea we like but
we're certainly going to kick the tires
and test out of it
all right here's why I know the
simulation is messing with me this
couldn't possibly be a coincidence
all right I think most of you know
enough about
kind of what I've been into last few
weeks to know that this is just weird
all right so I had this like very public
back and forth with Elon Musk and a
bunch of other followers
on the question of whether there existed
in reality anybody with power and the
with power is the important phrase here
anybody with power
who believe that the current level of
population on Earth we should we should
drive it down
as opposed to managing the rate of
growth so we definitely want to manage
the rate of growth
and there are good ways and bad ways to
do that but I contend that there's
nobody with power
nobody with power
who wants to decrease the absolute
number of people all right so now I have
this big public back and forth on that
point
and 60 minutes
runs a major episode yesterday
in which they interviewed Paul Ehrlich
the most famous person who has that view
and is really powerful more than I
assumed
now how could that happen within days
of me being this you know public debate
about whether this person exists
remember what are the chances of that
doesn't that just look weird
I mean it looks like I caused it
you know I'm not saying I did it just
looks like it
now what hold on what you're saying is
that this has been out for decades and
we'll we'll talk about all of uh Eric's
uh bad predictions
all right um
so here's some of
uh this was an Epstein's uh uh uh
Twitter feed
so
um Paul Ehrlich
here are some of the things that he's
been wrong about
all of his career so here are some of
the things so he got in 60 minutes and
he got lots of attention and here are
the things he's predicted are you ready
um
let me get to the list here
uh where is it all right Alex Epstein
did a long threadedness that I retweeted
if you're looking for it so here are the
things he's uh Alex is calling out uh
Paul erlich on
um he says he's been 180 degrees wrong
for 55 years in a row so here are things
he said humanity is now sustainable to
maintain our lifestyle yours and mine
basically for the entire planet you'd
need five more Earths
do you think we would need five more
Earths to maintain our current lifestyle
does that even
hold on Robert
so Robert we're going to talk about you
um Roberts of NPC
and on the Whiteboard I'm going to show
you how to identify people like Robert
so he's having a an episode now because
he's a binary
and you can't you can't kind of
understand that there could be two sides
of something or any kind of nuance
so Bob will learn he's an NPC today and
I hate to do that to you Bob but that's
that's that's coming up that's how
you'll find out
so if you're yelling me in all caps that
I must change my mind before you've
heard what I have to say
you're an NPC
if after what I say
you have a criticism well that might be
something I listen to that
but to be quite sure
before you hear what I have to say
feels like a little NPC issue all right
so hold on
so
so the context here is we're trying to
decide if Paul Ehrlich is a nut job or
he actually has power okay that's our
context
so here are things he said that the
world is now sustainable we need five
more Earths clearly nuts wouldn't you
say
does that isn't that isn't that
obviously nuts
like if our if our population stopped
right where it is
you think we couldn't handle that
that's nuts right
how about
uh the oceans will be As Dead As Lake
Erie in less than a decade
I think he was saying these things in
the 70s
that's nuts
yeah we don't have to wonder how wrong
he was
just observe
um
he said America will be subject to water
rationing by
1974.
so in 1974 it would be water rationing
and food rationing by 1980.
this is the guy
who is the number one most influential
person on population
okay wrong more wrong than anybody's
ever been wrong in the history of
wrongness
um and and Paul Ehrlich as Alex Epstein
points out
um he's the media's longest standing
environmental expert since the 70s
60 minutes
still thinks he's worth putting on TV
now if the context was not
if the context was not all the things
he's gotten wrong so you should never
listen to him again
something's very broken here
am I right
does does CBS in 60 minutes not know
that he's the wrongest person of all the
wrong people who have ever been wrong
that did that somehow Escape there
their gaze I didn't watch the episode
did they did they go back and criticize
him for his past wrongness
how much did they talk about how wrong
you spent in the past
did they just brush over it
all right they think he's right so they
treated him like he's like an actual
serious player
interesting all right
you said by the year I don't know any
predicted this but he said by the year
2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a
small group of impoverished Islands
inhabited by some 70 million hungry
people
so
um
yeah he said that
so let's say uh he said the battle to
feed all of humanity is over in the
1970s 70s hundreds of millions of people
will starve to death in spite of any
crash programs embarked upon now
okay
he said we will soon be asking is it
perfectly okay to eat the bodies of your
dead because we're all so hungry that
was 2014. 2014. I have to admit some of
you have been looking delicious lately
so all right you got one of them right
maybe that's just me
uh he wrote the population bomb that was
his book in 1968
basically got everything wrong
and that made him the media darling
for climate change
now
you tell me
do you think clearly clearly this guy is
influencing
uh non-government people
and he certainly if he influences enough
of them then the government people get
influenced as well
so would you say this is someone who has
power
because I was thinking of elected
officials
but is this person have power
the person who's been wrong about
everything in a laughable way
yeah I think you could argue that You
could argue that
he has power
now I was specifically thinking about uh
elected power
and here's my uh
here's my statement
um
has Paul Ehrlich specifically said we
should decrease the number of people
that we have now
because I didn't see that
but maybe you have
do you remember that the entire
conversation is about is there anybody
who has power
who wants to decrease the current number
of people like has a like a plan for
doing that so even even airlock
who is you know the most
nutty one on this
um
he doesn't ask to do the thing that was
the original topic so the original topic
was I said there's nobody who wants
fewer people
he said we have all kinds of problems
because of how many we have but has he
ever said we want to decrease the people
has he ever said that
um because he might have I'm not I'm not
saying he hasn't because I haven't seen
anything you say he's implied it
implied I know implied isn't good enough
I'm not going to buy implied because
just saying there are too many people
that doesn't imply that
it implies that we need to work harder
to feed people or maybe maybe reduce the
rate of new people but it doesn't apply
that just because he says there are too
many
yeah well I'm going to say
um
I'm accepting I will accept
this example of somebody who had power
without being elected
who influenced the system probably
um almost certainly but let's take this
further if it's a person of power it
means he actually changed changed things
is it fair to say this one person
changed things
I think it is yeah I mean it does seem
like he was a primary influencer so if
he changed things you should be able to
measure whether it was good or bad and I
I have a simple question here do you
think Paul erlich
killed
more people or fewer people than the
Holocaust
I don't know the answer to that do you
think the Ehrlich killed more people
than the Holocaust so let's say six
million or fewer
because he's blamed for India going on a
mass sterilization program
so that's certainly reduced some number
of people
um
he's certainly responsible for
influencing policies
that may have been sub-optimal for some
groups of people
but if he had this much influence and he
was wrong about everything
one assumes that he may have killed tens
of millions of people
is that unfair
I think that's actually an entirely
reasonable statement because the most
important thing we're dealing with is
the you know population and economy
isn't feeding us and climate change I
mean those are the most important
questions if he was 100 wrong on all of
them
did he not cause more poverty
because he would have been a drag on
fossil fuels which is really how people
get out of poverty or traditionally
but but just just hold the question in
your mind
has he killed more people than the
Holocaust I would say probably yes
is that
is that too
far
now I always say you should not compare
things to the Holocaust but I'm not
doing that I'm just I'm just using it as
a benchmark right it's not I'm not
saying he is the Holocaust
I'm just saying a benchmark for a number
of people dead I think he probably
killed more than the Holocaust yeah I
think his impact was probably worse than
Hitler
although no because World War II killed
about 60 million people so
not all of it was Hitler
I think you'd have to use the 60 million
to get closer to World War II's Badness
so he's not as bad as World War II but
he might be he might be more bad than
the Holocaust in terms of total impact
on the world
imagine working all your life to save
the world
and you're 90 years old and when you get
your final report well it looks like you
killed several Millions
we can't be sure but your policy is you
know for many objective perspective it
looks like it you may have killed 10
million people or so we we don't know
for sure
now I don't think he believes that I
think he believes he saved the world
so but it's debatable
all right and the final word on that I
believe when people get elected to
public office they can never say
anything that sounds like
I want fewer of my citizens to be alive
next year
nobody can be elected and say you know
you people who elected me
really what would be good is there are
fewer of you next year
it just it can't work it just can't work
all right
um
so yesterday I provocatively tweeted
something that would not have worked a
few years ago
so every now and then I like to test to
see if the the public mind has shifted
so I can say things you couldn't say a
few years ago one of the things you can
say now
is you can accuse
um the government or anybody else of a
conspiracy theory and it doesn't sound
crazy anymore
that's a big difference
am I right
you can now Embrace a conspiracy theory
that before you thought you know
I don't think I'd want to say that in
public
but now I'm going to say in public
something that I thought from day one
but the the environment wasn't quite
right
because people didn't understand the
degree to which the conspiracy theories
tend to be real
so here's mine I think the
Charlottesville Neo-Nazi March was a an
anti-trump OP I think it was our own
intelligence people who were involved
directly or indirectly I think obviously
many of them were real racists because
it was a it was an effort to collect
them up I do believe that some number of
them were
assets for FBI or something else
and some of the evidence that I would
suggest is and I tweeted this I said
ever wonder why the so-called news never
did profiles of the Charlottesville
neo-nazis and they never asked the
locals if they knew any non-racists who
attended the venue
but not marching with the races not
marching just we're in the same you know
zip code
um and wanted to support the statutes
now some people said Scott Scott
how in the world could you sport those
racist statues without being a racist
to which I answer same way you support
the Holocaust museums
the Holocaust Museum is not pro
Holocaust
you understand that right
it's sort of anti-holocaust
sort of its purpose you could do the
same thing with the statutes just you
know change change the plaque
this plaque was put up
um in our racist past you know this is
paraphrasing but do it better basically
you just put it in context you know the
this person supported slavery and he was
one of the heroes we keep it here for
historical purposes
boom just give it the right context
everybody's happy now not everybody's
happy that's too much but a non-racist
can have a non-racist argument for
supporting the Holocaust Museum
because it's providing context and they
could add the context which wasn't yet
there
to the southern statute is no big deal
no big deal so yes
I can promise you that there were locals
who had views like that who did attend
the event
why and I know because I talked to them
I actually asked hey you know I think I
tweeted it if anybody was there and
you're not a racist contact me and
several did now yesterday or the day
before I heard from somebody else who's
a local who says oh yeah
if you ask the locals a lot of them will
know people who attended who are
definitely not racist
so Trump's statement about the fine
people was the simplest thing to check
on the simplest thing just talk to a few
people who live there hey did any of
your neighbors go to the event
give me the names I'd like to ask them
if they share the racist views of course
not I mean some might who knows but I
doubt most of them would so think about
how easy it was to check
how easy was that I did it I did it with
one tweet
it was easy do you think the entire news
organization couldn't have done that hey
if you're if you consider yourself a
non-racist but you attended give us a
call we'd like to see what you're
thinking
the most important thing that determined
Biden's predecency
is that is that there were really no
fine people there
that fact and that fact alone is why you
have the president you have because he
ran on that more than anything it was
explicitly
that was never fact checked and had they
fact jacket as I did personally they
would have found the same result
yes there were fine people there
and so then the second part is why have
we not seen more about the attendees
you know the January 6 attendees like
tons of names are out there in the
public a lot of people you know partly
because they're arrested but I think the
names of the people
even if they weren't arrested were very
widely discussed you know we know what
Baker Alaska did we know what Ray Epps
was up to right there's a whole bunch of
individual names and personalities of
people who are there in January 6. name
name somebody who is at the
Charlottesville event
except for the organizers except for the
organizers name somebody who was at
Charlottesville just marching
that's less obviously missing right it's
just so obvious that they didn't talk to
the people marching and the only reason
I can think of is that it wasn't an
organic March some of them were racist
for sure but some of them surely were
not
surely so in my opinion given that the
transparency that the government is in
the media since the media is obviously
hiding the story
your reasonable assumption is that it
was an operation
it would disagree with that
do you disagree that the lack of
transparency given how easy it would be
to provide the transparency very easy
just moronically easy easier than
anything the news does hey call us call
us if you're one of those fine people
that's it literally the easiest thing a
news organization can do except talk
about the weather
the only thing that's easier is that is
talking about the weather nothing would
be easier than that
right yeah so the rule is
if you're an individual you're innocent
until proven guilty
this applies to your Andrew Tates and
anybody else if you're a government
you're guilty until proven innocent and
this would be one of those cases
now I don't know if the government's
involved
but the media is clearly covering it up
and we know that the media works with
some members of the government to cover
things up so the the assumption is
reasonable it's a reasonable assumption
you say A Bridge Too Far well remember
we're dealing with assumptions
right I'm not saying I have proof of
anything about Charlottesville that
would be a misinterpretation of what I
said I'm saying that
you you should favor the most likely
explanation and that's that it was an
operation you know Intel related op all
right
um
would you like to see my NPC identifier
let me show you how to identify an NPC
in the wild
it's easier than you think
we might have some here today
so here's here's how I do it if Scott
knows the following thing
discusses both sides of the issue
the people who are players that would be
non-npcs
they say well that's smart
you discuss both sides of the issues the
costs and the benefits
the risks and the rewards wow that's
smart but the NPCs would call you a
fence sitter because you haven't you
haven't committed
now if I say
that there's new information and this
new information revises my opinion
then the players would say well that's
smart
because you got that new information
so good good for you but the NPCs would
say you flip-flopper you're trying to
take both sides of every conversation
um
if I do not embrace all as conspiracy
theories I do like conspiracy theories
especially the ones that turn out to be
true like the Russia collusion hoax and
you know that sort of thing I like those
but if I don't accept all of them
then the players say well that's smart
you don't want to just like accept all
of them but the NPC say
you're a little bit gullible
a little bit gullible Scott
a little bit gullible
now
that's your NPC identifier
I'd like you to find the recent episode
of
Curry and Dvorak what's the name of
their show their podcast is
Adam Curry and John Dvorak is uh I'm
just blanking it's like one of the most
famous podcasts in the world No Agenda
yeah no agenda
listen to their conversation about me
and you tell me if uh Adam Curry is an
NPC
just use this guide
because what you're going to hear him
say is that uh I changed my positions on
things
of course I did
of course I did
if you didn't change your position
during the pandemic
I have questions
in the fog of War you should have
treated everything like he was deadly
because you didn't know
and then as you learn things you should
say oh okay I guess the masks weren't
that important
you know maybe some people shouldn't get
vaccinated but you do that as you learn
it
so so listen to the No Agenda I haven't
heard the whole thing I just heard I
heard the first sentence and it was
already wrong like it was a dumb
assumption about me it was just
incorrect
uh Master effective so we say
I need a TV show
foreign
opinions are optional
not being open to information I.E Scott
MD population all right here's a NPC
thing all right you all just watched me
discuss how I had been surprised that
this new information about Paul Ehrlich
does does
conflict with my view that there's
nobody with power who has that view now
that was just the context of everything
I just said that I am revising my
opinion based on new information and
then Chris says this all for that he's
offered new information and changing my
mind not for prejudicial bias and not
being open to info I.E Scott on
depopulation
so after just observing me directly
adding new information and then
modifying my opinion to fit the new
information
this NPC says Scott does not he's not
open on this topic I literally just
changed my opinion right in front of you
right in front of you
so Daryl says you were just wrong then I
will I will accept that interpretation
I'll tell you what I was thinking
but I will accept that you call me wrong
right I won't I won't argue that because
I put myself in this position here's
what I was trying to do
I was trying to be absolute
because that is more provocative
as in there is not one person
who holds this View and by the way I
proved my point but because you can't
tell you think I was wrong
my point was there's nobody who says we
should reduce the number of people
Paul Ehrlich doesn't say that but he
does sort of imply there are too many so
that so I'm accepting that as both he
has influence
and that at least it looks like he's
implying there are too many people
did I not accept both of those right in
front of you
now the reason I said that nobody exists
is so people would do their best job
of giving me counter examples
I will do this again in the future
and when I do it again in the future
you're going to say
that they proved to be wrong
but if you if you understand the pattern
I'm asking you to prove me wrong because
that's how we both figure out you know
how to get to the next level I was
asking people to prove me wrong in
public
so I challenged people to to prove me
wrong right and then people did
somebody says you hide behind narcissism
projection projection
the all cap the all caps guy accusing me
of narcissism
all right
um
well thank you some of them some of you
appreciate
what I'm doing here
here's putt life Scott spent three years
talking about Mass working never wants
to recover the other side
now that's an NPC
right do you think I talked about Mass
without ever covering the other side
do you think I never mentioned
that the mask allowed the virus out the
sides and the top I said that every time
that's clearly an NPC
right that the rest of you
am I wrong
is that not obviously an NPC there
couldn't be any human thought that's
happening there it could possibly be
foreign
yeah I always cover the other side so if
you dip in and see you know one thing
the only thing you haven't observed me
talking about from the other side is the
Russia
Ukraine war well I think that's has more
to do with what you've observed but also
is a phenomenon that I talk more about
the things that people don't yet know
so that that creates a bias so the
Russia Ukraine thinks a perfect example
if most of the things I talk about are
how Ukraine is doing better than
expected there are two reasons one
because I predicted it and that I think
that's important and two that's the
interesting part
the other side that Russia has all the
time in the world uh Putin can just
grind up Russian bodies until he wins he
can just wait until you know Ukraine is
ready I think that's all obvious
does anybody need to say that all of the
information coming out of the area is
non-credible
and that Russia could definitely win the
war
if if they want to you know press it to
its ultimate cost
is it so so the thing is that the
Russian side of it seems too obvious to
have to explain
so if I don't do it does that mean I'm
not considering both sides I guess it
could look like that
yeah which system sex exactly
uh there's no fresh take on Ukraine
I have the freshest take of Ukraine ever
Who provided the tiki torches well we
know who the organizers were so that was
who the organizers probably
Scott is evil okay
all right
uh
you don't eat bread I don't know
so
oops Rick says NPC is almost the level
of name calling it's a crutch used offer
rather than pointing out specifics now I
accept that criticism but let me respond
to it all right so
is is my identification of the NPCs name
calling because it leaves out the
specifics of what my complaint is
because you see me leaving out the
specifics of my complaint right here
right this is me leaving out the
specifics of my complaint
by identifying them and detailing them
on a whiteboard and then live streaming
the world this is how I'm ignoring the
specifics
that's an NPC comment
is that name calling or is that just
obviously somebody who's not who's not
engaging with any part of the reasonable
the reasoned
conversation
it's a name-calling analogy it's worse
it's worse than name calling it's name
calling and the analogy somebody says
except it's not an analogy in my
worldview in my world view NPCs are
actually real
I don't accept I'm not saying you should
accept it but in my world view there are
actually NPCs and
I have I have a hypothesis with no
evidence to support it
that Elon Musk thinks the same thing
I don't know I mean I'm not a mind
reader it wouldn't be fair for me to say
that but he has he mentioned NPCs even
like this week
oh and he tweeted recently that he
tweeted uh without any provoking I don't
well something provoked it but he just
tweeted all by itself
if you don't at least have a little bit
of doubt that you're an NPC you're an
NPC
so he's basically saying the same thing
it's the NPCs are the ones who act like
there's no doubt
right they're binary thinkers no it's
definitely this and no amount of
information will change it
so
I think he's identifying the people who
are unable to respond to Nuance as NPCs
and he does believe in the simulation
and if you believe that the simulation
features players who can modify the
simulation somehow and NPCs who are just
scenery
doesn't Elon Musk look like somebody who
Alters the reality all the time
and he acts like somebody who thinks he
he's a player and he can just change
reality and then he doesn't
and then he does it
yeah you need to play video games to
understand NPCs right so if this is like
a video game
not all the creatures you see have a
conscious entity behind them some of
them are just scenery
why would there be players
so the hypothesis is that if we are a
simulation created by some other higher
level of intelligence that they would
have a purpose for doing it
the purpose would be
either to a B test strategies which is
why I think I have a theme because I
have continuous water related strategies
so I believe I'm a player
that was inserted to act like you know
act like the people outside the
simulation so I'm actually a player with
the same characteristics and decision
making as my creators
but I I've got a theme
and so I'm dealing with all my water
related and plumbing problems and then
you've got a theme which is I don't know
maybe disease or something like that
you've got other problems I just don't
have those
and and that you're either a b testing
Solutions
or your entertainment
or or it happened accidentally yeah
maybe maybe an AI created uh simulation
that could happen too
so it could be either you know random
coincidence
um entertainment somebody's watching us
or they're trying to test strategies and
the one that makes sense is testing
strategies
what strategy is Elon Musk testing
if you notice that he has a theme as
well
what is Elon musk's theme
it's the impossible
right Elon Musk the theme that he deals
with every day is how to do the thing
that everyone says can't be done
do you think that when they started
PayPal and they wanted to move money
digitally without actual physical money
or checks don't you think that that
people told them that couldn't be done
no no you're gonna have to get the banks
to like give up their Monopoly and
Congress is bought and didn't that don't
you think that looked impossible when he
bought it when he built an electric car
everybody said that can never be
economical oh sure you can build it but
let me tell you what you'll never do
you're never going to be profitable most
profitable car company in the world I
think
um
build a rocket to go to Mars and a
rocket that that is reusable build a
reusable rocket that just like lands
upright
like 60 sometimes already this year or
last year
impossible
take over Twitter
overspend like crazy
and then make it profitable does that
sound possible
seriously does it even sound possible
that he could make Twitter profitable
I've looked at the numbers and I'm
pretty good at numbers and I'm pretty
good at business pretty good at knowing
what a good business model looks like
it looks impossible
honestly it just looks impossible but do
I think he'll do it
there's a good chance yeah I mean
nothing certain but I think he has a
good shot at
like everything he's talking about
makes sense
you know and would move you in that
direction if you could implement it
I think you might pull it off so over
and over again people have themes
he seems to be doing the impossible mine
seems to be uh dealing with rumors about
me maybe that's everybody in the public
eye
Brady gets divorced and loses a fortune
I don't know was that related
all right
um now what else is happening
that's about it
now let me test to see if
uh you know me well enough
you just saw me call uh Adam Curry and
John Dvorak NPCs
why did I do that
go
you know me well enough by now
what am I doing
what's my plan
test my reach no not really
bully am I being a bully stirring
stirring energy
triggering them
test for a reaction
uh
I need attention
I always like attention
yeah it's it's partly an energy thing
but but it's also because uh they've
been next to me
I don't know if you know that so I can
add that piece they've been decks
because they consistently misinterpret
what I say and then do one of the
biggest podcasts in the world in which
they uh malign me and defame me and
don't correct it
now in the past I've been invited to
correct it you know on their show so
they have invited me to correct it and I
give them all the credit for that but
they're decks and they're wrong about me
and so I'm going to call them NPC just
to get a reaction
I I don't suspect they're NPCs but I'm
going to call them that because they're
acting like it right so if they're
acting like it
if they're acting like it it's just more
interesting to you know put down a
marker and say look if you can act like
NPCs and just misinterpret what I said
in the first sentence Adam Curry
misinterpreted when I said what'd he say
I forget what else is
some total misinterpretation
I'd like to see how you would do in a
structured debate poorly poorly
do you understand why I would do poorly
in a structured debate
everybody know that because a structured
debate is
designed to remove the advantage of the
best the best debater
am I okay
I'm great
um
yeah I'm not sure I debated Sam Harris
that was a conversation
it looks like Jim Jordan is going to be
the speaker is that real
too broad it wasn't both who criticized
you um
uh Dvorak was in a in a prior podcast
but but it is definitely true that the
two of them have a completely uh
inaccurate View
of my pandemic views now since there's a
good chance that one of them will hear
about this uh I updated I updated my
pandemic opinions and predictions so
that all the NPCs can just read what my
actual opinion was
and I put the link in my profile
so if you run into a conversation about
me and what I believed or didn't believe
you can just point them to my profile
and there's a long write up of what I
did and did not
believe
did Ben Garrison get it right no Ben
Garrison is a
I'm considering suing Ben Garrison
what do you think
can I sue Ben Garrison for you probably
probably reduce my income by a third
by starting some rumors
because in this day and age accusing
somebody of being pro-vaxx which is the
opposite of what happened
uh that kind of slander is really
expensive to the victim
so he's a and he's a low character
unethical weasel
but I don't expect him to correct in
public so I'm going to use him as my
personal Whipping Boy
so maybe maybe every day from now to
Eternity I'll remind you that Ben
Garrison is an untalented hack and
unethical piece of
suing is for the lame well would you say
that if you lost a third degree for your
income
this is a serious question if somebody
defamed you
they knew they had because it's easy to
check that he was wrong
and they don't correct it and that
becomes your permanent brand and it
decreases your income by 30 forever you
would say that you wouldn't take legal
action in that case really you wouldn't
take legal action in that case you're
lying
you would definitely take legal action
what about Nikki Klein
you never heard of him before I
mentioned him yeah he's not he's he's
well known on the right
and they're the ones who
have been fooled by him
oh good fake words
foreign
you say I would have better opinions if
I travel to more third world countries
that's true
I generally speaking people who have
traveled and experienced other countries
and cultures they have better opinions
so I I accept that
that comment
uh
how would proof of income be decided yet
so that's the problem the the closest
you could come and I don't think this
would hold up in court I could do a poll
and I could find out how many of my
followers believes that rumor I guess
they'd be ex-followers if they believed
it
um so you could you could find out how
many people believe the rumor
and then you could quite easily say none
of these people are ever going to buy my
products again and that they're not
going to follow me on any monetized live
stream
and then you could say okay uh
40 of my base believe this rumor that
totally made me toxic to them
um but maybe only
some percentages of that you know really
is is the important part so I don't you
couldn't you couldn't prove it
with a specific dollar amount but it'd
be easy to demonstrate statistically
I don't know if a jury would buy it
yeah it would be a tough case but it
would be tough for him too see part of
it is uh it wouldn't be just to get
Justice
it would be to
um
would be to
enable Karma
because somebody who does something that
bad to another person that they've never
met and never did anything to them and
that's really bad what he did that's
very bad
all right Karma should visit him
and if it hasn't yet I'm going to make
sure it does
so Karma's gonna come visit you
and nothing you can do about it
so yeah bankrupting him in the process
and destroying him would be completely
within my ethical bounds yeah at this
point destroying him financially
would be completely ethical
does anybody disagree
if somebody punches you first and it was
an illegitimate punch you've got a free
punch
with no right
how would I destroy him well
I suppose if he won the court case I'd
have to pay his his lawyer fees so
uh
but
if you were involved in a lawsuit it
would make him very unhappy whether he
won or lost
he did not cost you money
NPC
now that's an NPC comment somebody said
he didn't cost me money he poisoned a
third of my audience
and you think that didn't cost me money
no no thinking human would believe that
it's like do you think that EA lost any
audience when he said his recent
comments
because he can't prove it right can can
yay do you think EA could prove
they lost money because of the comments
I guess he could because
licenses were canceled
yeah I guess you could measure that
wound directly
uh what features would your debate
platform have
I think I've talked about that too much
oh 4chan is changing Ben Garrison's
Comics to turn them hilariously racist
well if there's anybody here from 4chan
uh
I better not say it
yeah 4chan is such an interesting place
because I think they do both the worst
and the best things there there's
nothing in between they're either doing
things that you really wish had never
happened
or things that nobody else was going to
do and somebody had to do it like
there's nothing in between
I got invited to a Bohemia Grove once
true story
but as an Entertainer not not as a
participant
um
yea did it to himself yeah
all right ladies and gentlemen I think
I've said what I need to say and I'm
going to go do something else best live
stream you've ever seen tomorrow we'll
get the locals platform iron out and
we'll be back to that
bye for now
best live stream ever
