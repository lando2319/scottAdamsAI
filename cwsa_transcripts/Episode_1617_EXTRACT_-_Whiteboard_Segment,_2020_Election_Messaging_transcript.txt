now i'm not saying that the republicans
will take this advice
and this is advice by the way but look
how easily the republicans could just
win everything
with january 6 as their issue
which seems impossible doesn't it
because it seems
if the democrats are saying january 6 is
the
is the one thing that they have going
for them
democrats
what are the odds that that's going to
be the same thing that would be good for
republicans
well let me show you
so when you're talking about the uh 2020
election as former president trump likes
to do
uh he uses what i call the child frame
the child's frame was you said it was
rigged it wasn't fair
what do i say about fairness
fairness is a concept that was invented
so idiots and children have a way to
argue
because fairness isn't real
there's no fairness in the world
everybody disagrees about what is fair
so arguing fairness is exactly what
children and idiots do
it's that's the idiot frame i ca i'll
call it the child frame because that's
not quite as insulting as the idea frame
but if if you're arguing anything
if you're arguing anything is unfair
you've taken a child's point of view
compared to what you could have said
which i tweeted today
a non-auditable election bears the full
presumption of fraud
which is i have no i have no proof of
fraud
no proof
no no courts have proven it
so take the official thing that the
democrats say no court has proven it but
the courts are also the wrong vehicle
for it
and since we don't have a vehicle for
looking into a non-auditable
situation
then the full presumption of fraud has
to be on it because it's a government it
is not an individual
if the government were an individual
let's say a citizen you would never use
the presumption of crime you would
always use the assumption of innocence
for individuals but for the government
because of their power
if they intentionally make something
non-transparent they intentionally hide
something or they intentionally design a
system that can't be audited
they may have some fraud in there they
may not
does it matter
well it doesn't matter for the past
because the past is already settled
but it definitely matters for the future
so if you're a republican and you decide
to take the it was rigged
or even if you don't
deny it
let's say even if you don't say yeah
that the president went too far
which is also bad because then you're
just criticizing your own party so
instead of criticizing your own party
which won't work and say oh yeah it
wasn't rigged
you're not going to get elected that way
because the republicans won't even like
you if you say it wasn't rigged
if you say it was rigged
well you don't get president that way
either probably
because there are too many people think
okay that's too far there's no evidence
of that proof there's no proof of it
there is evidence
but you know evidence can either be true
or false
if you do this this is called the high
ground move i have tried this out on
many people how many people after
hearing this push back
okay after hearing that a non-auditable
system
has to bear the full presumption of
fraud
not a little bit the full presumption
how many people pushed back
none
none
and the one that i i mentioned
was actually absurd
it's just absurd
the pushback you can't push back on a
high ground move
the reason it's the high ground is that
everybody agrees
this is a non-controversial point of
view
that makes anybody who wants to push
this one and by the way i'm not saying
oh this is interesting uh
youtube just went offline
oh locals
youtube just went offline
i'm watching and now it's trying to
reconnect
it's completely offline
you saw this in real time didn't you
now let's say it says reconnect if like
that
all right well it might be back we'll
have to wait to see if we have any
comments so there we are
did you guys lose the feed there for a
while
yeah interesting
so what i told you
that the entire
narrative
when i told you the complete narrative
could be destroyed with one sentence
and it was obviously true
youtube copy
do you think that was a coincidence
that at the very moment i told you how
to kneecap the entire democratic
movement
with precision and absoluteness
okay can you agree with me
can you agree with me that this message
is unbeatable
let's just the i say this message is
unfucking beatable
like a hundred percent of people
right
this is the end of the democrats
uh on youtube they're saying there's no
audio hey paul can you give me a
uh there's only one person i trust on
this on locals
paul
are you there
um i saw you say that the audio was good
yeah paul said it's good but they're
still saying it's not
now
okay i was confirmed
uh all right the audio is fine so it's
just the trolls we have a confirmation i
finally i finally worked out a system
for knowing when the trolls are just
saying the audio is bad and that is
having a a trusted person who's watching
both platforms so
paul thank you you are a
citizen and a gentleman and a patriot
and the patriot
paul collider thank you very much
um so let me just uh summarize
uh if the republicans lose the leave the
child frame and stop saying it was
unfair
and they go to the high ground maneuver
that is the end of any chance that a
democrat
could be president
i mean you you would have to do
everything else wrong to lose the
election under these
circumstances
and you'd have to be really
quick
about dismissing the court cases and
you'd have to do it the way i do it
when because somebody's going to say but
all those court cases and that's when
you say this is also a high ground
maneuver
but you know the court can only look at
what's brought to them and what's within
their jurisdiction
so the court maybe could look at one
percent of an election
maximum
now is that accurate
if i said to you the courts could only
in the best case scenario
given that they can only look at narrow
little things within their
jurisdiction and narrow little claims
then maybe the court could get at one
percent of the transparency
is that fair now i don't know if it's
ten percent or twenty percent of one
percent but but claiming one percent
doesn't sound wrong
i mean it feels like it's in the range
of
the right direction
