home hey everybody
welcome to another day a coffee with
Scott Adams which is yes that's right
the best hour of the day sometimes even
when it's not an hour
sometimes they'll be done in 35 minutes
and it's still the best hour of the day
how do I do that I don't know I don't
know it's just like magic
but if you'd like to take it up a level
and you do right don't you want to take
it up a level
um
there's a op-ed piece today by Jason
Riley in the Wall Street Journal
somebody says I should check that out
all right but before we do that all you
need is a copper micro glass a tanker
jealous Diamond flask
a vessel of any kind except the kind
that have holes in them fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine the end of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous zip and it
happens now go
I'm going to give you now
because I I love you all so much
I'm going to give you one of the most
useful tips you've ever had in your
whole life
if that sounds like an exaggeration
well wait till you hear it
this might change everything
because it did for me this this is one
of those uh I guess reframes or you know
different ways of looking at the world
that for me once I saw it I never on I
can never unsee it and now everything is
filtered through this filter and I'm
going to give you the filter
like most of these tips they don't work
on everybody all the time
but for some percentage of you watching
this right now this is going to blow
your freaking mind
but it won't happen right now
the mind-blowing happens later once it
sort of sinks in have I built it up
enough
here it comes
keep track of your good days
versus your bad days you know the days
you're happiest versus the days you're
not
and then track the following things
and ask yourself which of these happened
in the last 24 hours
did you get good exercise
just track your mood
within 24 hours of exercising especially
the same day if you exercise in the
morning probably sets you up pretty good
so track your exercise
track it did you learn something useful
did you learn something
watch How often on a day when you learn
something useful you're having a good
day
how about intimate relations did you
have some intimate relations with your
loved one or somebody else I suppose
and watch How often you're in a good
mood
that day and maybe a little bit the next
day as well
how about food and sleep did you eat
healthy food or did you eat a bunch of
crap
check your mood your mood not your mood
your mood check your mood after you've
eaten well
that day or the prior day
and then look at your sleep did you get
enough
if you track it just these five things
you're going to learn something about
yourself that will blow your head off
which is that your moods are almost
entirely created by these five things
now some of you might want to add a
category right there might be something
you do that totally changes your day for
example my wife if she goes flying like
like yesterday and today
she gets so much joy about being in the
air that it makes her whole day good for
about 24 hours
so find out those five or six things
which you know influence your life and
then just track it and you're going to
find that your good days that you think
are about what's happening you know to
you today
not much relevance there it's mostly
these five things to do exercise did you
learn something did you have some close
personal relationship that is Meaningful
did he eat right and did he get enough
sleep
just do those things
somebody's saying in the comments did
you accomplish something significant now
I think we all know that that makes a
good day if you accomplish something
significant but I don't think it's
necessary
because if you've learned something
you feel like you're on the system right
you feel like you're moving somewhere
and if your body and everything else are
good and you've got a good relationship
and you've exercised that relationship
if you know what I mean
um
once you learn that these things are
controlling your thoughts
you'll realize that your thoughts and
your your experience are just one unit
you know you tend to think of your brain
as this physical thing that's over here
doing its thing and then there's your
environment that's off doing its thing
and sure that environment influences
your brain
but think of it as just one big brain
and if you're sleeping
that's good for your brain if you're
exercising Etc
all right that's your most useful tip
for the day something like 10 to 20
percent of you
just experience the beginning of a
substantial Improvement in your life
like really big
about 20 of you the rest of you maybe
already knew it
all right
there was a funny tweet today that uh I
believe this person is admitting was not
entirely original but Asia flyer tweeted
today at this point in time I would feel
safer if the coronavirus held a press
conference to advise how to protect
against to protect myself against the
government
that's a pretty good line I don't know
who thought of it first so Asia Flyers
not taking credit for it yeah let's have
the coronavirus tell us how to protect
ourselves from our own government
I wish that didn't make sense
but it kind of does
all right new news about the FBI
apparently they allegedly used at the at
least
12 informants
in that situation where there were a
bunch of people who tried to release
plan to kidnap the governor of Michigan
and try out try her for I don't know
some imagined crimes
so there were 12 informants and the
question is
did the informants make it happen
were they contributing to the fact that
maybe it wasn't going to happen unless
the informants were
goading them a little bit
um
and the answer is we don't know but
here's the bigger context
is the FBI even on our side anymore
have you noticed how many stories
will show the FBI or some intelligence
agency from the United States
not always looking like they're on our
side
right it's a little bit
confusing
um
we'll talk about uh Giuseppe we'll we'll
get to your your point here in a minute
all right so how many how many cases do
we have the FBI and intelligence
agencies being questioned we could all
we could go back to Russia collusion
when we first learned that our
intelligence agencies absolutely can't
be trusted
or was it really the first Iraq war with
the weapons of mass destruction
not the first one the second one the
what about that what about the weapons
of mass destruction
intelligence agencies failed
what about the riot slash Insurrection
as some call it on the capital
did the intelligence or FBI have
anything to do with that
don't know
do they have anything to do with our
election security I don't know
I don't know but it's kind of sad that
we're yeah Epstein
Etc Iran Contra
uh there's a pretty long list of things
that our own intelligence agencies are
at least implicated in or suspected of
yeah that I'm seeing all the uh yeah
Haiti
were we behind Haiti what about Cuba
is the United States behind the Cuban
protests
probably right don't don't you assume
that even if they didn't start it they
at least got involved a little bit why
wouldn't they
yeah
so we definitely have a different
situation with our own intelligence
agencies which is if you're trusting
them maybe you shouldn't maybe you
should
um there was a uh Instagram star
influencer who like to take pictures of
herself uh
poised on dangerous Cliffs
she fell into one of those Cliffs and
now she's dead
now
this is one of my fears because you
might know that my wife Christina takes
a lot of selfies for her Instagram page
and she does sometimes stand in very
dangerous places to get the best picture
and I gotta say this is my nightmare
scenario
of her falling trying to take a picture
but so there's nothing funny about this
except we've reached a point where the
vanity is worth more than life itself
that people will take the risk of
literally dying
literally dying
and
somebody says my wife does that garbage
pisses me off every time yeah because it
feels like
risking their life and your life too for
a picture does it
feel it feels like you know you're
you're sort of uh
you know if somebody was a loved one
Falls over a cliff it's not like it just
affects them
you know I'm thinking it's like me on
the cliff right
it doesn't even feel like it's something
else it just feels like it's you on the
cliff all right
Biden made a speech on voting rights and
there's a clip that came out of it that
I'm having trouble believing is real
I assume there's some context left out
but if you've seen the video of Biden
saying that it's more about who counts
the votes than it is about the votes
which is sort of a call back to uh was
it a Stalin who said that
that it's who who counts the votes that
matters not who votes yeah it's a Stalin
quote and there's a clip of Biden saying
it yesterday basically saying it with
his own words not not a quote and I
thought to myself
were we missing some context
was there something else that would have
made that sound not as bad as it sounds
it's as if the at least the Democrats
are making two simultaneous arguments
one is that the election was fine
and the other is that elections are
never fine
right doesn't it feel like that they're
trying to take two positions that are
opposites yeah this election was totally
fine
everything was good about this election
also all elections are not fine
I feel like you gotta take a stand
either they're all fine
or they're not
and if they're not we should be able to
question it and if they are well make
your case that they're all fine
I suppose you can't prove a negative so
that I guess you'd have to prove that
they're not fine that would be the more
fair way to do it
but
certainly it seems that uh Biden is
admitting that our voting system has
problems
can't you take that away from it right
yeah binary theater exactly binary
theater is where you act like it's all
one thing or all the other thing
so here this this next piece will give
you a real feeling about how bad our
news situation is you ready for this
so Greg Abbott who wanted to respond to
Biden saying that that Texas in
particular is trying to pass a bunch of
laws to make it harder to vote and to
suppress the vote from presumably uh
Democrats presumably black Americans
which would be the accusation
and of course Greg Abba says you're
you're lying Biden basically I'm
paraphrasing and he said that the Texas
legislator legislature is passing a law
that quote expands early voting hours
and prevents mail-in ballot fraud
so which one is true
um oh if you're watching on locals and
you're only getting a black screen it's
working fine
you may have to try a different browser
or restart your browser or something but
it's working fine for everybody else
um
so who who's lying is Greg Abbott the
governor of Texas lying
that the rules being contemplated won't
make it harder to vote and won't be
voter suppression is that a lie or is
that true
and is Biden lying is Biden taking
something that is nothing but normal
protection of an election process
and somehow turning That Into You know
something that it isn't which one's
lying
let me ask you this
show me a link
to the publication
that lists each of the rule changes that
Texas is contemplating
and then judges each of those rule
changes to be either a standard practice
that's just good for an election keeps
things secure or could have no purpose
other than suppression
find me that article
I'll bet you can't
and here's here's the mind
I'll bet you can't
because isn't that the biggest story in
the country
the biggest story in the country should
be here's the list each bullet point
for the things they want to change and
here's the analysis that says okay this
one just makes sense
this one looks a little sketch because I
don't think this one is going to make
anything more secure but it might
suppress the vote
this next one looks good this next one
could be either way
right if you were going to write the
story
and you were not a partisan
and you just wanted to objectively write
the story about the Texas election rule
changes isn't that what you would do
you would just list them all and then
you'd say that will suppress or that
will just make things better right
where's that
good luck
good luck finding any article that gives
you information that you could use
every article will either take a
position that there's nothing here to
see or that it's voter suppression
the news
completely stopped being news
I guess maybe you already knew that but
there used to be at least some
pretending right at least there was some
pretending now I don't believe there's
even one publication
who's even made the slightest attempt
to tell you what the actual news is you
know what are the facts
how do we see these facts nobody right
okay and I'm looking into your comments
because if somebody had seen such an
article you'd be saying oh read The
Washington Post article or read the
Washington the you know the Wall Street
Journal
you know I haven't looked for every
Source but I'll bet you I'll bet you the
news doesn't exist
all right Henry Cruz says the New York
Times had loads of facts did they
how did they organize them did they
organize them the way I said which would
allow you to understand them or was it
in a dense narrative in which by the
time you were done you weren't quite
sure the pluses and the minuses
I'll bet you it was in a dense narrative
and it was not just a bunch of bullet
points and a few words about each one
because that would tell you what's
happening anything else is just is just
a propaganda
all right
um
so here are some of the counterpoints
that I saw just on a tweet that made me
think of this so it doesn't matter who
tweeted it but some Rando tweeted about
Greg Abbott's complaints that there was
nothing about voter suppression here
the Counterpoint was and do a fact check
on me here so each of these things I'm
going to say I don't know them to be
true it's just something I saw on
Twitter
is Texas Banning 24-hour early voting
is that happening is Texas Banning
24-hour early voting now the governor
says they're expanding early voting
hours
but is that the same topic
or is expanding early hours the same as
24-hour early voting
because I think there's just word games
going on here right so I don't even
understand
what's happening
so
I'm seeing in the comments what I think
is the case which is that the day of
voting you could vote earlier which
would be good good for everybody
but maybe you can't vote the day before
is that what changed
could you not argue that getting rid of
voting the day before would suppress
votes
how could you
how would you think otherwise
somebody says what does suppression mean
in this context
well suppression could mean that for
some people with some kinds of jobs it's
harder to get away to vote
so if you give them more options of
times they can vote you increase the
odds of somebody who's having trouble
scheduling it can make it happen
um
Dave Rubin said the National Review of
all places had your bullet point list
um if somebody could send me a link to
that not here but you know where to find
me send me a link to that on Twitter I'd
like to see it
all right but in any event it's
certainly not a common way that it's
being portrayed all right here's another
one is they're banning drive through
voting is that happening
is somebody Banning drive-through voting
I'm not even sure what drive-through
voting is exactly except I guess you
don't get out of your car
now why would they be banning that
what would exactly would be the problem
with drive-through voting
so all right I'm saying a lot of people
suggesting Dave Rubin handle this so
I'll go I'll go check that out
um
so I don't know why they ban
drive-through voting there must be more
to that story how about asking for voter
ID for mail-in ballots
I feel like that's kind of fair
are you telling me that we didn't
require any kind of indication of
identification for a mail-in ballot
is that true
I didn't even know that was true
was that always true
that you could just mail in your ballot
without any photocopy of your ID or
anything
um
so it does seem to me that that would
suppress the vote
for sure
makes a little harder but it also makes
it harder to cheat
so would it be fair that this is a case
of voter suppression or would it be a
case of just making an election more
secure
well looks like both doesn't it
but
if it suppresses and also makes things
more secure which way do you go
do you say well
making it more secure is not worthwhile
I guess it depends how unsecure it
becomes
uh
whoops hold on
uh that's what the whole mail-in voting
thing is about identifying who who is
certainly men
you know I always thought that there was
at least some way to check that they
were real
um and maybe not
maybe not
okay
so and are all the other items even
important or is this having ID for voter
ID for mail and boat votes maybe that's
the only one that matters
do any of the other things even make a
difference
they checked my ID but I had no
confidence my vote went through somebody
says
somebody says that they checked your ID
and signature matching are all that
matter so they do a signature match
I don't know how good that is when was
the last time you signed your you signed
your name the same way
am I the only person who signs their
name different every time
when you're signing your let's say your
uh credit card thing or whatever
do you use the same signature
yeah I just do a scribble I mean for the
last 10 years I don't even try to do my
name I just go over that
right but some of some of you actually
sign your name the way the way like a
regular signature works
yeah I haven't done that for years I
don't think you could find two of my
signatures in the last 10 years that are
even close
all right well okay we got lots of
questions on this the news is not
serving us well
all right I caused some trouble
yesterday and I remind you that when I
talk about the topics of uh the pandemic
uh I'm sort of into now more about the
psychology of it
and the psychology of it is infinitely
interesting to me even if you're over
the pandemic itself so if you talk about
mask work or vaccinations work or
whatever I I don't I'm not into that
conversation so much let's just talk
about how people feel about stuff and
how they make decisions
all right and I'm going to start with uh
start with a little poll that I did on
Twitter
I said if you're unvaccinated
um well here's how I started off the
controversy this morning I said if
you're unvaccinated you're in the middle
of a deadly pandemic but if you're
vaccinated
it's just Wednesday
now this is a statement of my own
psychological situation
meaning that European may vary of course
but to me being fully vaccinated once it
was done
I didn't feel like I was in a pandemic
anymore you are you know a lot of you
are in a pandemic
but I'm not going to die from it I mean
my odds are so low now that it's just
something I'm not thinking about
and I don't wear a mask anymore
I haven't had a mask on for a while if I
traveled I'd wear one but I decided not
to travel until I don't need to wear one
so for me the pandemic's sort of over
now a number of you of course said but I
I already had kovid so it's over for me
and other people say I'm not afraid of
it because it's such a high survival
rate so it's over for B2
um
but here's the thing
I'm going to give you the hypnotists
filter on all these decisions
and it goes like this and you're not
going to like it
everybody who made a decision about
getting vaccinated or not vaccinated
made their decision based on fear
that's the that's the hypnotist filter
because we don't have enough information
to make a rational decision we don't
know the odds of One Thing versus the
odds of another we just don't have the
information
so we're making the decision based
entirely
on what scares us the most
and if you're doing that
and you're accusing other people of
making the decision based on fear
you're operating at a lower level of
awareness
then you will be when I'm done with you
all right the low level of awareness is
that you made your decision based on the
data
but other people who maybe who made
different decisions made their decision
based on fear
that's a pretty low level of awareness
it's the common one probably the most
common one but it's a low level of
awareness the higher level of awareness
where the world starts to make sense to
you is that everybody including you
including me no matter how rationally I
talk about it we all made our decision
based on fear
then we rationalized it
now some of us are better at
rationalizing right I'm a professional
author
so I could probably rationalize better
than you can
meaning I do it for a living I put words
together to sound persuasive it's what I
do I'm a professional so I could
probably rationalize my fear decision
better than you could but does that mean
that my decision was based on logic that
data
nope no I was just better at
rationalizing it it might look like it
was based on you know logic and data
because I'm so good at rationalizing
but no the hypnotist knows that only
irrational processes were at work for me
but also for you
so let's let's walk through this a
little bit
which of these fears scares you the most
or risks let's say are you more afraid
of a rapidly approved vaccine I asked
this in a Twitter poll this morning so
what is scarier you can tell me in the
comments you can play along what is
scarier a rapidly approved vaccine now
I'm going to use rapidly approved
instead of the words I hear on the
internet like untested
or experimental
uh or guinea pigs all right I could have
used any of those words but I'm just
going to say rapidly approved
because that sort of captures the risk
don't you think
so what is scarier to you a rapidly
approved vaccine from your government
which has lied to you for years
now of course it's from Private Industry
but the government's involved
or would you be more more afraid of an
engineered deadly virus made by China
so those are your two choices a rapidly
approved vaccine
or an engineered deadly virus
which one is the bigger risk
the answer is you don't know
you don't know
you have no way to know if either of
these could damage you in the long run
no way
now now
I observe
that the people who are afraid of the
vaccine more than they're afraid of the
virus itself
tend to rationalize
By ignoring long-haul risks
so if you see a rationalization that
says but the survival rate is 99 percent
and then they're done
the 99 survival rate that's all you need
to know
that person is rationalizing
if they were using data and facts they
would have used data and facts they
would have said for example well there's
a 99 chance I'll survive based on my
demographics but there's also this
long-haul risk that is hard to calculate
and a lot more people have that and
maybe even more people have it than even
know they have it there might be people
thinking they're suffering from other
problems but really it's the Long Haul
maybe a little inflammation in the brain
maybe a little little inflammation in
the organs Maybe
now does the long-haul risk turn into
any kind of a permanent problem
I don't know
does the does the coronavirus infection
once you've fully recovered
is there anything lingering
is remember it's an engineered virus
so if you're comparing it to every
seasonal flu
maybe you're leaving on a risk
because this thing was engineered
right probably I think we're still in
probably Zone that it was engineered so
if the only thing you knew was that you
had a choice of a rapidly approved
vaccine it's scary or an engineered
deadly virus from China
oh that's pretty scary
you see where I'm going right
all of your decisions
all of your decisions including mine
about whether we got vaccinated or not
had nothing to do with data
it had nothing to do with logic it had
nothing to do with how well you can
interpret the science it had nothing to
do with agreeing with science or
disagreeing had nothing to do with your
personal freedom
had nothing to do with trusting the
government per se
it was just what scared you the most
that's it
it's what scared you the most
now you know my uh relationship with
China right
not so good to say the least
China me no we're not friends we're not
friends at all so am I influenced by the
fact that this thing came out of China
absolutely could I tell you exactly how
I'm influenced not really that's not how
it works I just know that I must have a
bias because if you put this much
pressure on me in this situation
I just assume there's a bias what do I
think about American
Scientific capability
pretty good pretty good which is not to
say that there are lots of scientific
studies that get debunked something like
half of them I think that are
peer-reviewed get debunked
but here's my bias
I'm biased in favor of American
Technology
not for a rational reason I just have
that bias I'm biased against China
because they shipped fentanyl into this
country and my stepson died of an
overdose that included fentanyl so I
have a permanent hatred of the Chinese
government not the people of course but
the Chinese government
so
when I evaluate my fear
am I more afraid of the engineered
Chinese virus or have I just put all my
bias into that bucket
I don't know I can't tell
that's how it works
maybe you can tell because on the
outside looking in it might be a little
more clear but on the inside looking out
I can't tell I don't know how much bias
I'm applying to any of this
but I will tell you
that uh in my immediate family we're all
vaccinated
now
should I tell you to get vaccinated I
think you've watched me if you've
watched me closely enough I have never
told you to get vaccinated
can you fact check that for me
if you've watched me long enough I have
consistently said it's not up to me to
tell you to get vaccinated and in fact
if you want to not get vaccinated I'm
100 okay with that no no problem
whatsoever personal choice we've just
sort of turned into two different
countries some vaccinated some not but I
can live in mine I don't have a problem
living my choices as long as you're
happy with yours then we're both good I
don't need to convince you
to go from totally happy
to something else right if you're
unvaccinated
you're probably totally happy about that
what am I going to go talk you out of
being totally happy and then give you
something to fear that the vaccination
might corrupt you somehow in the future
why would I add a fear
to something that you've got completely
handled
if it's handled is handled if you're
happy I'm happy we're good I don't need
to change your life to make it less
happy
be happy
all right so I'm not trying to change
your mind and I was asked if I'm
stealthily trying to do that
does anybody think that does anybody
think I am stealthily trying to persuade
you to get the vaccination
because in my mind that would be
unethical
it would be completely unethical
because I'm not a doctor
if your doctor tries to persuade you
fine
but I'm not
and I'm also aware that we're operating
on uh on fear so that's no way to make a
decision
all right
you may know a user user named anomaly
goes by his Twitter handle is legendary
energy
and I believe he's a well-known
vaccination opponent
and when I when I tweeted on this topic
he responded this way
uh about my comments
he said if you are Scott Adams you are
low IQ have brain damage or you are
purposely lying
so he believes that my opinion about
whether you should get vaccinated or
whether I should get vaccinated I guess
or not is based on either low IQ brain
damage
or purposely lying now if we are good at
reading comprehension
we probably believe that he is intending
to say that I'm lying
or that I'm stupid I guess about the the
topic
um and he goes on to say if you read the
data or are an even below average
thinker you know he's full of
so anomaly believes that a citizen
of average intelligence can read the
data
and come to a decision that's a logical
decision that is sort of free of our
biases and stuff
what do you think of that
do you think the ordinary citizen can
read the data
and they make a good decision
that's one of the dumbest things
you'll ever hear in your life
let me tell you if you've fallen for the
myth
that the average person can do their own
research and come to a decision on a
scientific or even financial decision
that's one of the dumbest things
in the world
you really can't
I have a pretty high opinion of my
abilities
would you agree
if you've watched me long enough would
you say it's true
that that I Scott
have a high opinion of my abilities to
you know analyze things and figure out
what's true from what's not right I have
a very high opinion of my abilities
I can't read the data and come to a
decision
that's not even close to what I could do
and I think I'm more capable than a lot
of you
if I'm being honest
may not be true but if I'm being honest
I think it's true
I think that I have lots of lots of
elements of my talent stack from being
you know an economist to your business
experience I've got an MBA
you know I I've learned persuasion Etc
so my talent stack should put me in
pretty good position to do what anomaly
says anybody can do just read the data
yourself
that's the lowest level of understanding
so I would say anomaly is suffering from
the problem of Youth
not lack of intelligence for sure smart
guy smart guy for sure
but
I believe there's a lack of experience
that may be fixed just by time itself
that if you believe you are capable of
looking at the data
um
let me let me talk here to user uh
TGI Ozzie who says in all caps fix your
volume fix your volume fix your volume
no
no there's nothing wrong with the
 volume
all right I'm just going to say it once
there's nothing wrong with the
volume on Netflix it's a Netflix bug the
problem's on your side go fix your
 volume
or get off the light get off the Stream
right just fix your volume or get or
just off just leave
right
um maybe I got triggered a little bit
so anyway my my situation here with uh
anomaly who's a smart guy but operating
at a pretty low level of awareness at
this point
still thinks that an average person can
read the data and come to a rational
conclusion doesn't understand that all
of us made our decisions based on fear
and fear alone we didn't use any data
because we couldn't understand it if we
looked at it
but here's how you tell if one of us is
in cognitive distance you ready
what is the trick have I have I ever
taught you this have I ever taught you
that you can determine which of two
people is experiencing cognitive
dissonance if it looks like it's one of
them I mean it could be both I suppose
but it looks like one of them has
cognitive dissonance and the other one
doesn't on this topic how do you know
which one it is
um attack the messenger that's a good
clue but not as good as the one I'm
going to be talking about yeah the
personal attack
is is can be a tip-off
um but there's another thing there look
for the trigger thank you
um yes look for the trigger there has to
be a trigger you don't get cognitive
dissonance if the world looks exactly
like you assumed it would look
right
what does my world look like
you you've all seen my many of you've
seen my opinions for the entire pandemic
right does my world view right now
was it broken
in other words is there something I
thought was true
that now a science or experience has
shown me is is not true
because if that happened that would be
the trigger
and I might not be aware of it
um however let's say if you were anomaly
and you were anti I think this is fair
if I'm if I'm mischaracterizing them
which is easy to do
if I miss characterizing uh anomaly
somebody let me know
but I believe he's a skeptic about the
usefulness of the vaccinations relative
to the risk
is that fair
how's he doing
how is his world
uh his worldview that the vaccinations
are maybe not a good idea
how's that looking compared to actual
experience
would you say that the data supports his
view that it was a bad idea to get
vaccinations
or does the data support the idea that
it's a good idea and that is working
fabulously at the moment
um
which do you think
um he is skeptical of the pandemic so
he's skeptical of the the seriousness of
the virus would that be accurate if he's
skeptical about the seriousness of the
pandemic itself then that would extend
to being skeptical about the need for
vaccinations
so I hope I hope I'm characterizing him
right I'm not trying to mischaracterize
him
well I would say that my world view the
vaccines vaccinations add some risk but
that
it's a good risk management trade-off
for most people
I would say that my worldview is being
supported by the data and the entire
scientific community
you know when I say attire I mean mostly
consensus how many of you would agree
with it with a statement that my world
view as it is developed hasn't changed
that much but as is developed is still
consistent with everything we observe
would you say that's true because if
that's true then I don't have a trigger
but is anomalies worldview that the the
pandemic wasn't really real in the sense
that it wasn't as dangerous as as uh
purported and that the vaccinations may
be an overreaction with an extra risk we
don't need is that backed up by the
science and and the
yeah I don't think it is so I think this
is one of those cases
but again I'm not the one who can judge
it right
because I could be seeing something that
just isn't there because I'm I'm in this
situation that's how cognitive
dissonance works
but you my friends
are not in the situation the way he and
I are because we're having a
conversation about it so you could be
the judges
which one of us has a trigger and which
one of us does not
and which one of us has a Keener
understanding of how humans make
decisions
it's me
could be experiencing confirmation bias
all right that
is pretty much what I wanted to talk
about today but let me ask you this
um since we brought up the point
I'm going to ask you which is scarier to
you
the because I didn't see all your
answers I'd like to see this again just
as a wrap up which is scarier to you a
rapidly approved vaccination
or an engineered virus that comes out of
China
which is scarier in the long term
because in both cases you're really
talking about the long-term risk that's
unknown right
uh wow
okay over on locals it's all China
engineered virus
and somebody says both is no fair
you can't be equally scared of both are
you
see a few people say the rapid
vaccination
now one difference of course is that
whoever made the rapid vaccinations was
trying to help you
whoever made a engineered virus
maybe they were trying to help you
Maybe
um
that is a BS comparison no it's not
who who thinks it's a BS comparison to
compare maybe you're talking about
something else it's not a BS comparison
to to compare which one scares you the
most because that's how you made the
decision
um
I'm afraid of this binary choice
all right
the they engineered a virus to sell
vaccines you know I always worried about
that with McAfee
did you ever wonder if McAfee ever
created a virus so he'd have a reason
for his company to sell anti-virus stuff
I'm not saying it happened
but you have to assume be thought of it
you know you have to you have to assume
that at some point he thought to himself
you know
the more viruses there are out there
that I can fix the Richer I'll be
now again I have no reason to assume he
did that or anybody else did that but
man that risk would be
I mean you could do it and get away with
it so easily
it feels like that'd be a pretty big
risk
yeah I have no reason to think you would
do that so that's not an accusation
all right
uh somebody says virus made by
incompetence versus a vaccination made
by incompetence
are they incompetent
I don't know the the rapidly approved
vaccination
um
that's just as competent as you can be
in a short time frame the problem is the
time frame not the competence
uh it's totally real just engineered and
released okay
now why are we not hearing about booster
shot being needed for the um
the moderna is that because we know the
moderna lasts longer or because they
just haven't tested it as well
I'm still waiting to hear if I'm gonna
oops there's something about moderna
um
yeah the MRNA stuff holds a lot of
problems right that you know I think the
biggest accidental outcome of the
pandemic
is going to be the Golden Age
Imagine This
do you think the Golden Age could happen
without the pandemic
because think of the things that the
pandemic changed it changed you know
commuting patterns it changed maybe you
know where we live
but one of the things that the pandemic
changed is that we sort of rapidly got
pregnant with this mRNA stuff
how far could the MRNA technology have
gone without the pandemic
because the pandemic took a thing that
was promising and turned it into you
know a gigantic thing which can now be
extended apparently the technology
platform can be extended into curing a
whole bunch of previously incurable
stuff and a lot of that's in the
pipeline they're testing would we have
been so far along and would the public
be as willing to try an mRNA thing on
some other disease
if we had not gone through the pandemic
so one of the outcomes of the pandemic
might be a gigantic Improvement in
lifespan
you know maybe that's bad too but yeah
at least we're trying to get that
I feel like
the MRNA stuff could be just a world
changer maybe not but it has that has
that potential
um do you helping yeah decoupling from
China
if the pandemic helped us decouple from
China is that good or bad
probably good
um yes and we also the pandemic also
exposed the problem we have in our
school systems you know the the problem
of the lack of choice and the school
the teachers unions Etc
uh we aren't decoupling dick
uh I agree with that statement the
amount of decoupling we've done from
China so far
is Trivial to none
but I feel like we stopped the the
momentum toward more coupling so maybe
that's first
um
yeah covid was persuasion for the MRNA
technology well not intentionally but it
worked out that way
yeah I think we have more awareness of
things made in China for sure and I
definitely would make a decision based
on that you know in for every product I
could buy in China I would pay more for
the American version
now you know I'm part of the stupid Rich
so I can do that I wouldn't ask you to
do it but I would pay more
I don't know how much more it depends on
the on the item if it's a let's say it's
a household item you know you're just
gonna buy a new sponge for the for the
for the kitchen
I would pay 20 more for the American
sponge
you know I don't know if I'd pay 20 more
for a house or a car I might I might
start to get a little selfish at that
point but yeah if I'm if I'm buying
I I don't know I think this cable may
have come from you know China or at
least some of the cables I bought
recently came from China if I could have
bought the same cable for 20 more
from an American company definitely
no no hesitation 20 more for an American
product every time yeah and it wouldn't
have anything to do with quality I don't
even know if I get quality
um
yeah some things were only made in China
you know what I'd also like to see is a
list of things that are made in China
that the United States would like to
encourage being made here
wouldn't you like to see that it's like
these things are made only in China
I'd like to see that list
what is made only in China because that
would be the best business you could
ever start let me give you a startup
idea
find a product that you can make in
America ideally with robots because
that's what lowers your cost
um the you know the employment costs if
you could find anything that's only made
in China and then you make a robot
version of it in the United States and
sell it as only made in the the US
that's a real good business model right
now
right
e-bike Motors and batteries yeah I don't
know how many batteries we make in the
United States that's a problem but
wouldn't battery manufacturing be robots
if you made a battery manufacturing
plant
that'd be all robots right
um
oh so Giuseppe says you'd be hesitant
yeah you know if
when we're talking about the vaccination
risks if you're younger it's a different
different calculation we I think we all
agree with that
all right
I'm going to close down YouTube for now
thank you YouTubers for watching by the
way before you go
YouTubers
hold on locals talking to the YouTubers
for a moment here
could you hit the Subscribe button if
you'd like to get notified of this I
never ask you to do that because it's
pain in the ass and it slows down the
show so I don't like asking at the
beginning where most people do it's just
terrible for the flow but as long as
you're here and we're done with the
content if you could hit the Subscribe
button before you go it would help me
out
because you know the bigger this grows
the better it is for me but it's also
good for the world I like to think
let me ask you this am I a good Force
for the for the world
do you feel that if somebody watches me
they come out ahead
because that's what I'm trying to do I'm
trying to go beyond uh entertainment if
all you're getting out of this is
entertainment uh I would be disappointed
because I'm shooting much higher than
that oh thank you now the people and
locals are of course there is a
subscription service some more people
are going to say yes
um oh good I'm getting lots of good
comments on on YouTube as well
so that's good to know by the way this
is the reason I do it I mean I could do
a lot of things to make money
and I could do a lot of things that
would be you know maybe useful
but the only reason I do this
um is because it's helping
and you know what I did my personality
test the other day one of the things
that came out of it was that I have some
kind of a genetic need
to be useful
which I don't think is universal
apparently it's a personality trait but
if the only thing I did was found a
great way to make myself happy
it would make me unhappy it just
wouldn't last you know the only thing
that has a lasting
like real benefit is if you do something
for other people and maybe that has some
lasting benefit
uh
Calvin says he has a genetic need to be
high in the hot tub well I share that
need with you
as that's happened a few times lately
um the nightly covet talks were awesome
yeah you know I feel as though
I I I've said this before online this is
something I'll say at the end of the
broadcast is that I always thought that
my future I had sort of a vision of my
future all of my life and that Vision
included that when I reached this exact
age
there would be a global disaster
that I would have some role in in terms
of communicating and I always I always
had that Vision in my head since I was a
kid that my entire life Arc was about
building The credibility or whatever it
would take
such that when I reached exactly this
age
I would be useful
in a global problem I didn't know what
that Global problem would be but I feel
like the pandemic delivered it
so now the pandemic is my fault I like
to think I predicted it but maybe I
manifest it can't rule it out
um
all right
uh did you do it so
I don't understand that question
um
all right just look at some of your
debates
uh I should debate or Converse live with
anomaly uh would that really help I mean
it would be entertaining
but
um I'm going to tell you uh
uh this is terrible but I'm going to say
it out loud anyway part of here's a
little uh a trick for you for writing as
well as doing what I'm doing you know
doing anything in public
if you can do something that makes it
sound uh dangerous or provocative
you know that'll stick in people's minds
and they'll want to watch you here's the
reason that I would not be interested in
debating anomaly
I I hate to say this out loud but it's
true
it wouldn't be fair
I don't consider him
here ready
in other words I think he's smart enough
definitely smart enough
but he's also Young
and I feel like he needs a little
seasoning before that would be a fair
fight
um
and it would have to be a fair fight or
it wouldn't be any fun
you know I don't want to just like be
clubbing a baby harp seal on on live
stream now obviously he would think
that's not going to happen but
I don't think he's quite ready for that
and by the way I don't want that to
sound like an insult if you looked at me
at his age
you know if you could reverse me back to
his age totally fair fight
basically he's me
he's me at that age basically so uh
debating me at that age if it's me at
this age that wouldn't be a fair fight
so
um
should be ignored
um are you planning to have guests well
my understanding is that at least the
locals platform is going to allow some
guest access if YouTube did a better job
of that maybe I'd do that too so I have
to figure out how to do that
platform-wise I've tended not to do
guests because I find those shows to be
slow
does anybody else have that experience
we like guests
so I'm sure I'll have some on here but
don't you notice that those shows are
slower
does that is that just my impression
I'm going to look at your comments here
because I will actually decide based on
your comments
um
mostly boring yeah screw guests uh well
no yeah I did have Naval ravacant on
here he's not like a regular guest if
you hadn't noticed
anywhere Naval goes it becomes more
interesting
so he would be the exception
okay I I see you recommending Atomic
Habits by James Clear is that because
you think I should interview him
because if I interviewed him I think
he'd say
he got some of his ideas from me
I think he has said that but
um or at least that they're compatible
with with my stuff so we'd be basically
Talking to Ourselves because we just
would agree on everything
um oh he says it in the book
okay
I would like you to be a guest on Viva
Barnes
how many of you are watching uh the Viva
Barnes podcasts they're really good it's
becoming my favorite
um podcast
so uh and I think he's on Rumble as well
as YouTube he's on they're on locals as
well if you haven't watched Viva
and Barnes uh I think it started out as
a good concept but they didn't quite
have the execution down and now now the
execution is looking really good
and so when they've now that they have
the great execution they have the great
you know two great personalities and
they do great topics
I would say one of the strongest
podcasts actually in the whole internet
right now it's one of the best things
out there and you won't see the same old
opinions
they're fresh every time
and you'll see stuff that you hadn't
seen before you'll see references to
facts you hadn't heard on the mainstream
media and I would say top top shelf Viva
Barnes
so do it do a Google on that you can see
the name spelling in the in the comments
just Google it most of the talk is about
legal stuff but it turns out that almost
everything in the news has a legal uh
element to it lately anyway the
political news and they do just a great
job on it
um yeah just do a search just do an
internet search on Viva and Barnes
b-a-r-m-e-s it'll pop right up highly
recommended and if you subscribe you can
see it on locals and I think you'll see
some extra stuff all right that's it for
now
bye for now on YouTube
