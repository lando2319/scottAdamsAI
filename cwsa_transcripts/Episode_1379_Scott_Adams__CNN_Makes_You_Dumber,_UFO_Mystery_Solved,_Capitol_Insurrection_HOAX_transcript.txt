is the very best part of every day
no exceptions and today will be extra
extra good because it always is and all
you need is a copper bug or a glass of
tanker gels to stand a canteen jugger
flash a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better everything it's called
the simultaneous sip
and it's going to happen right now go
oh yeah that's good oh i hope it was
just as good for you
well let's talk about all the fake news
let me ask you a question
was any of the news today real
like any of it sometimes i wonder
let's get into it so fox news is
reporting
that cnn had a guest
on nine different times who
according to fox news was just making up
a story
about ron desantis governor desantis
uh pressuring people to
fudge the data on coronavirus now
reportedly there's no truth whatsoever
to this
according to fox news cnn had her on
nine times nine times
and apparently there's just no truth to
it there's there's no substance
whatsoever
and chris cuomo had around at least five
times
or exactly five times and that was in
the context of
talking up his brother and talking down
florida
just completely completely unethical
behavior
according to einstein the simultaneous
sip is not simultaneous
because of different frames of reference
well
ah i hate that you're going all einstein
on me
but you're technically correct
so what do you make of the fact that cnn
had
basically a liar on nine different times
so you totally trust the rest of the
news right
just because this part of news was
absolutely totally fraudulent
and i i have to wonder
what does that tell you about the things
that you can't know whether it's true or
not
because when you can tell when you have
the ability to look into a story and
know for sure
what was true at the end then you can
look back and see how the coverage was
but is it a coincidence that whenever we
can verify a story it's false
are you worried about that that whenever
you can verify it for sure
it's false but all of those other things
that you can't verify
because there's you know sort of
differences in the science or the
interpretation or
the opinion or the facts are not clear
oh that's all true
yeah that's all good but those few times
when you can actually check and find out
for sure
if the story was true or false
they're all false it's probably just a
coincidence right
all right exaggerating because obviously
it doesn't
not all the stories are false um
steve cortez made me laugh today i think
he's learned
learned a few tricks from president
trump in
how to insult people well i don't know
if he made this up
but he referred to dr fauci as a fascist
gnome a fascist gnome
how do you not laugh at that
i mean that's virtually trump level uh
cleverness now i don't know if he made
that up but if he did is pretty funny
um and i guess dr fauci admitted
that he may have worn his mask a little
longer than the science required
indoors anyway just to sort of
try to be consistent with the cdc's
recommendation
so we do know that dr fauci
seems to have made at least a little bit
of a distinction
between what is scientifically correct
and what is a
messaging priority so
is that wrong well i'm not going to be
as
harsh on dr fauci the
the the fascist gnome because
because i think his job is partly
science and partly messaging and partly
persuasion and if he was doing exactly
that
you know science plus persuasion plus
messaging
i'm okay with it you know i i get i
totally understand the criticism
that he departed a little bit from the
science
and and that hurts his credibility but
if your job
also is messaging i'm going to give them
a pass on that
origin of covent have i read it by
nicholas wade i have not read it i this
is the second time i've heard about it
in two days though i
i'm hearing good things about it but i
don't know anything about it
i also don't know that it matters does
it does it matter
let's say we knew for sure that there
was a gain of function testing on the
virus and it came out of the wuhan lab
then what then what
nothing right then what is nothing
there's no difference
it's it's information which we're
curious about but it doesn't have any
function
because don't you think that it's a
guarantee
that the big laboratories somewhere
are doing gain of function testing i
think so
do you think the united states isn't
doing any gain of function testing
really really you think russia isn't
doing any
really you know north korea
well i don't know about north korea but
if they could they would
so i just don't know that it makes any
difference if we we know it or not
because i think we can say without doing
any research
that is happening probably in all the
major
countries labs probably so if we found
out for
sure does it make any difference
i mean maybe we try harder to not let
one out but i have to feel
i have to feel that we always try hard
to not let out a deadly pandemic virus
i just don't know what would be
different now if somebody has a
suggestion of what we would do
differently
maybe we'd put more pressure on china or
something but what difference would it
make
are they going to respond to more
pressure they're just going to say we
didn't do it
if we could prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt
that it was a weaponized virus that came
out of the wuhan lab
what would china say no it wasn't
that's the end of it that's the end of
the trail yes it was
no it wasn't but yes it was look at all
of our evidence
yeah you probably made it up no
seriously it's really good evidence
look at it look at our evidence yeah i
think he made it up
we live in a world in which facts just
don't make any difference for stuff like
this
so it'd be great to know i mean just out
of curiosity but has no function
uh msnbc host ali velchi
has declared the israel's treatment of
the palestinians as apartheid
and of course there's a little pushback
on that as you might expect
and part of his argument is that the
israelis are gobbling up land that used
to be
belong to uh the
palestinians and uh that they're using
legal tricks and
you know national defense and lots of
lots of rationalizations to gobble up
land and
put settlements there now i feel as if
that characterization
at least of the gobbling up land this
seems fair
right i i'm a in case you're
new to my live streams i'm uh very very
pro-israel and they're right to defend
themselves
um but i think it's a fact that they're
gobbling up land and
you know billing building settlements
and stuff
very intentionally very strategic and
as i always say i can't criticize any
country from doing what is available to
them
to improve their situation we'd do it
any country would do it so you can
complain but it's not going to stop
anything
people countries are supposed to follow
what's in their best interest
and israel is clearly doing that to the
possible detriment of other people but
that's how it works unfortunately
now here's my take on this whether or
not
the apartheid claim you know fits the
facts
there's clearly some stuff going on over
there that's better for one group than
another
right we we can certainly agree
that not everybody is in the same
situation right
whether you label it apartheid that's
just the politics of it
but my take on this
is that as long as hamas has a stated
plan
of destroying israel israel has a free
pass
let me say that again if somebody ever
in your life
says my plan is to kill you eventually
to like just kill you eventually i might
not do it today
but eventually i'm gonna do everything
in my power it's my top priority
to kill you suppose it was somebody in
your life who said that
and they meant it they're not bluffing
it is actually their plan to kill you
someday
do you have a moral and ethical um
let's say a moral moral and ethical uh
right
to kill them first
yes yes you do absolutely
if somebody's is making a credible
threat
that they will kill you maybe not today
but eventually and you believe it and
they have a history that proves they do
this kind of thing
yes you are ethically and morally
completely within your right to slay
them where they stand
even if they haven't lifted a hand
against you
now you would go to jail forever right i
mean it's murder
so it's not legal or even close to legal
but it is morally and ethically
completely fair
completely now this is a hypothetical
situation
that doesn't really exist in the real
world there are not people who make
credible claims
that they will someday kill you except
for a stalker i suppose
in which case you can kill the stalker
and if you put me on the jury i'll let
you out but i don't
i don't recommend killing a stalker let
me say it again
if you kill a stalker and i'm on the
jury
you're in good shape don't worry about
it
but if i'm not on the jury you might
have to worry about 12 other people
convicting you
so i don't recommend it but let me say
unambiguously
if you ever kill your stalker and i'm on
the jury
you're not going to get convicted as
long as the facts support
that it was a real threat and a real
stalker if you kill him i'm okay with
that
i don't recommend it don't do it
let me be clear do not kill your stalker
unless you're in immediate danger
so it's not advice but i don't like
stalkers is what i'm saying
and likewise i don't like habas saying
that they're going to destroy israel
eventually no matter what they do
and as long as that's their position uh
i'm okay with israel
doing anything they want yeah i mean
within
within reason i mean you know if they
tried to
literally kill everybody in gaza i
wouldn't be in favor of that
or anything close to it but i don't
think they have any ethical or moral
problem whatsoever legal problems
yes you know they have to deal with that
separately
but no no moral or ethical problem to
just gobble up that land
uh the hamas has just made it easy for
them to do it
apparently there's a group of science
deniers advising the white house
interesting turn of events wouldn't you
say
let me give you some details there's
something called
the white house's environmental justice
advisors
environmental justice advisors and
they're opposing both
nuclear energy and carbon capture
projects
do i need to say more you could not be
more anti-science than opposing the two
things
that pretty much all scientists say are
required
and way better than the alternatives
carbon capture
if we if we become more efficient at it
it's not quite there yet
and nuclear power and the biden
administration
is pro-nuclear power right
so their own advisors are advising them
against something they know to be
unwise their the advice is unwise
and the biden administration knows it so
you know i'll give credit to the
administration
for knowing that this is unwise
but how do they justify
how do they justify having advisors who
are anti-science
i mean obviously anti-science you can't
get
much more anti-science than being
against nuclear energy or carbon capture
because science is in favor of those
very clearly and unambiguously
so the new england journal of medicine
has a little article in there saying
that
when the two dose vaccinations were
tested apparently they tested the
efficacy
of the second dose soon after the first
so when they did the trial they didn't
wait as long for the second dose
as we are in reality and the uh
importance of that is that apparently
you can do some magic with the numbers
i'm not sure i
totally trust the analysis but i'll just
tell you what they came up with
which is that the first dose might have
been way more effective
than we thought because the first dose
was still
increasing in protection
at the time that they gave them the
second dose so
when they were testing the efficacy of
the first dose it was like closer to 50
percent
but it was still increasing so they
didn't really test
the efficacy of the first dose
right so this is the important point the
efficacy of the first dose
of the two dose treatment wasn't really
analyzed because they're sort of in a
hurry and they
made a little bit of an assumption that
the second dose would be
important so they they kind of stuck
them together a little close
but apparently you can use some
statistics in math and analysis and
and untangle the untangle that situation
and when you do it makes the first dose
look like it's
almost 93 effective when it reaches its
peak
now it might not last as long and that
would be an argument for the second dose
but here's my argument
i feel as though we're going to get to
herd immunity
way sooner than the experts are saying
here's why
um sorry something just set off my
security camera but it was a bird
we're good nobody's attacking the house
um
so here's my argument the experts are
saying that we might need
75 to 85 percent people
to get vaccinated do you believe that
do you believe that we'll need 75 85
percent of the people to get vaccinated
to
have herd immunity well here's what i
think
now that we know the first dose is as
effective as it is
in some states we're getting pretty
close to 60 percent
of people who had the first dose at
least the first dose
now if this were a generic
pandemic where you know all people were
affected sort of similarly
you know children got it as badly as
middle-aged people as badly as adults
or you know the older the elderly will
always get it worse but but if it were
more
spread out then that sixty percent
seventy percent herd immunity thing
makes sense right
but what happens when you have a
situation where you get
almost all of the vulnerable people
vaccinated
which is where we are right now right
we almost probably
have all of the old people vaccinated
now the people who are unvaccinated
are mostly children who don't really
have a risk which is different from
other pandemics
so if you add to that the fact that the
first
dose we have we're approaching 60
percent
it's like 50 60 percent in most states
i think we're there or just
right almost there because
if you added to the sixty percent the
children who don't make a difference
and you uh added to that uh the people
have natural immunity
maybe it's not as good as a vaccination
maybe it is
um and then on top of the people with
natural immunity
you add the people uh because they had
the virus once
you have the people who have some kind
of cross-reactive immunity
other types of coronavirus apparently
gives you a little bit of immunity
i feel like maybe we're there like
right on the edge where it's just going
to fall off a cliff
any day now now i'm not saying you
should throw your masks away or anything
else i'm not telling you anything
i'm just saying that if i had to guess
i'm going to guess that we get to
something like a
functional herd immunity because of this
weird situation of getting all the
vulnerable people first and the kids
don't really need it
i feel like we're right on the right on
the cusp
of herd immunity if not already there
you know i mean when you hear the taxes
of zero deaths
yesterday we might be there
so um i'm gonna be a little more
optimistic
than the experts uh but
i like that the experts are not as
optimistic as me it'll
maybe it keeps people getting vaccinated
and maybe that helps i know some of you
disagree rasmussen did a little poll in
which they were
testing the knowledge of americans
and they were finding out that the
people who watched
cnn and msnbc were the least
informed of these three groups
uh people who watched fox news we're
more informed
at least on the three questions that
i'll tell you in a minute
but somewhere between uh fox news who
are the most well informed
and cnn and msnbc who are the
least well-informed there was there was
a category in the middle
people who don't watch the news
that's right people who don't watch the
news or at least television news we're
better informed
than the people who watch cnn and msnbc
so in order in the order of which one
informs you best
it would be fox news those viewers were
the best
people who didn't watch any
thing at all they were number two
and at the bottom with cnn and msnbc
so if watching their news makes you
dumber
it's a mental health problem now what's
the definition of a mental health
problem
well the definition is not just that
you're different
the definition is that it affects your
life in a negative way or somebody
else's life in a negative way
that would be a mental illness do you
think that the people
at cnn and msnbc the the people who
watch it
and are becoming less and less well
informed
do you think that that has any impact on
their happiness or anybody else's
of course it does of course it does
the cnn viewers think they're on a
planet that's going to burn up and
by the time their children are you know
in the middle ages
that they think the whole planet's on
fire
they they think that there was a an
insurrection at the capitol just
like a few months ago the cnn viewers
are definitely experiencing mental
health problems
because the information that they get is
panicking them and is not true
let me give you some details here so the
questions that they asked were on
let's see health insurance income tax
rates and the debt i think were the
the three things and in each of those
fox news viewers were way more informed
relatively speaking a lot of people
still didn't know anything
turn off the news yes maple bob
um so
you know i it sounds like i'm joking
right when i say the cnn and msnbc
give you brain damage and or mental
illness i'm not joking
i'm not even a little bit joking
it's funny yeah should we regulate cnn
like heroin and cocaine
i don't know there are a lot of people
who do cocaine who aren't complaining
as long as they have enough money but
the people
watching the news the wrong news
definitely getting their duck getting
dumber
and apparently the viewers of nbc abc
and cbs
similarly were underinformed
so i feel like this is a real thing that
has to be addressed
and here's what i would love to see i
would love to see this rasmussen poll
become a a permanent ongoing feature
in which we simply report who
whose viewers are the least informed
right because right now we check uh who
has the most viewers
and fortunately it's fox news because
they're the best informed
so isn't it good that there are more of
them but
we should be tracking this we should
track it every month
and find out whose viewers are the least
informed
because that should tell you something
how would you like to be
an msnbc or cnn viewer and to learn
that your group is the least informed
least well-informed anyway would it make
any difference
no i probably wouldn't you would still
just do whatever you do
all right i've got a ufo update um
so we've seen several kinds of ufos
and i feel like we have an answer for
all of them now
so one of the kinds of ufos was this
triangle
it was like a this green floating
triangle thing do you remember that one
we all saw the video
and apparently
that can be reproduced with a camera
lens of a certain type
that actually has an aperture that
closes down to that triangle
so the triangle one is nothing but a
light in the sky
probably another aircraft that the
camera aperture
makes it look triangular triangular
in certain cases and that can be
reproduced
all right so number one the flying
triangle
has been debunked all right so take that
one off of your list we know how that
was done
it's a just a the way the lighting works
and the
aperture uh number two you've got the
ones where
they you could actually see like a photo
of something metallic
and and other ones that seem to be
buzzing around in the vicinity of
military assets
well there's another theory that these
are actually uh
terrestrial drones now i'm going to talk
about the ones that defy
physics next so we're not talking about
them yet
that's that's coming up these are just
the ones that are
hey there's something here we can't
explain and it seems to be
buzzing around our our our stuff
the thinking is that those are actually
surveillance
drones that um some of our
you know normal earthly adversaries
are using to collect data so the
thinking is this
if you send a drone toward a military
asset
say american navy or or pilots there
the the american assets will respond
so they'll respond as if it were a
threat or as if it were something they
need to look into
now that response is information the
enemies would like to know
so they're so the thinking is that
they're sending drones
against our assets and that the drones
themselves have some electronic
surveillance equipment and that they're
looking for a response
and then they're measuring the response
so that if there ever
were a real attack we could they could
anticipate what the american military
would do
and i find that explanation uh
very good for maybe some of it
yeah we'll talk about the speed next
speed is coming up
so those that do not look like they're
violating
physics could be just drones that
are unidentified now what about
the shape that they don't seem to have a
form of propulsion right
you we see just a shape and it's oval it
always seems to be oval
there's an explanation for that it's
infrared
the infrared is not going to necessarily
show you the full shape of the thing
the infrared is going to show you where
the the heat difference is
and if it's a bird it looks like an oval
yeah the cigar shaped object with no
propulsion
is what a bird looks like on infrared
because you don't see the wings
so it looks like there's no propulsion
but the the bird's body
is a different temperature than even its
own wings
so the body shows up as an oval because
it's an
indistinct object and the wings don't
show up
and it's just that so you got your birds
that
look like that on infrared they look
like ovals now what about
the defying physics so the defying
physics things
has also been debunked and what it is is
that if i
if i can do let's see if i can do
a visual representation of that i will
use
uh all right i'll use my wedding ring
here as the
unidentified object this remote control
is the airplane flying over it and
looking at it
the airplane's camera has to change
direction it's looking directly down and
then as the plane goes by it's looking
backwards looking backwards right
so the perceived speed of the object
will be altered by the by the speed of
the plane and the angle of the camera
and apparently smart people have looked
into it and have determined
that just the normal speed of the plane
as as is shown on the screen
of the ufo video you can just look at
the actual screen
with the with the ufo on it and it says
the angle and the height and the speed
and you have all the information you
need right on the screen
that if you were smart enough to do the
math you could calculate that it's a
bird
and that it's not defying physics it's
just a
artifact of the camera moving and the
angle moving quickly
at the same time as the object is moving
in another direction right
so stardust is saying the effect is
called parallax
i believe that's right so i believe that
is
every part of the ufo sightings
explained
sorry sorry i hate to ruin it for you
but i don't think there are any ufos now
you had
people lying people misremembering um
any number of things and and you've got
some interesting stuff
now here's one i've uh i wonder
remember you saw the drone that seemed
to splash into the water
and i joked about it being a bird it's
probably a bird
but let me ask you this
is there any such thing wait for it
as a submarine launched drone
because i bet there is by now
or or at the very least we're definitely
trying to make one
because what could be more useful than
a a submarine that can launch a drone
i can't think of anything that would be
better than that can you that would be
the
obvious most obvious most likely thing
that you would want to invent
is to pair a drone that you can launch
from your submarine
now does that mean that that was a drone
going back in the water and returning to
its submarine
could be but more likely a bird
just trying to get a fish but it could
be
so everything you say about speed is
that parallax thing
and has to do with the camera angle and
it's not they're not really moving like
that
it just looks like it all right um
i got the idea of that uh that it's at
least some of
them are are drones from enemies from
tyler
away in an article in the drive so i'll
give him credit for that
there's a report today that the pentagon
has a shadow army of 60 000
people in a secret force with 900
billion budget
900 billion i hope i'm reading that
wrong
900 billion
is that right that can't be right i just
copied and pasted this from an article
but really 900 billion
that can't be right right i feel like
that could be 900 million
but it says billion but i don't believe
that we're spending almost a trillion
dollars on the secret army
and we're just finding out about it can
can the pentagon
hide a trillion dollars a year
what i'm a little confused by this
reporting
but apparently this uh secret force
are people who are like a force
multiplier for
intel agencies but they don't report
on the payroll so that they uh they're
basically
people who are just pretending to be
regular people and if they were caught
they would have no connection
that could be determined to uh
intelligence agencies except
by their activities i guess so
um i had two responses to this number
one
i'm kind of glad we're doing this
because obviously china is
other countries must be doing it so i
would think that
this is something very useful for our
national defense
but it sure is scary
it's kind of scary to find out that your
government is doing this stuff but we
probably need it
i'm not going to complain about it i
don't know enough about it
so i think we we should start calling
the capital
insurrection stuff a hoax and we should
just
append the hoax to it like we did with
you know the drinking bleach oaks and
the
fine people hoax and the russian
inclusion hoax and the other hoaxes
so i think that someone needs to write
the book of hoaxes
for the last several years
because there are some really
interesting stories about how all these
hoaxes
came about but there's a short video
clip
on rumble that i tweeted retweeted this
morning
and it's a clip showing the capitol
police
talking to a couple of the protesters
that you've seen on video
including the the the
viking horn guy so
the guy standing next to the viking horn
guy has got a little uh
some kind of a loudspeaker system and
he's telling the other protesters or
whatever you want to call them
he's telling them okay the police will
work with us the capitol police
and you can see the capitol police
standing right next to him
having a civil conversation about what
they could or could not do
and the police were essentially telling
them that if they would agree to be
peaceful
that the capitol police would sort of
let them peacefully protest
as long as they didn't break anything
basically which i think was good
policing
like i feel like the capitol police
took the energy out of the protesters in
exactly the right way
at least what we saw on video you know i
told you uh oh i didn't tell you i
on locals i gave a lesson on how to
defuse a fight
using hypnosis and i noted on this video
that the capitol police were using the
same technique
and the technique is you bring your own
energy down
so the capitol police were not saying to
the protesters
you don't do this if you do this i'll
kill you
you know if you do this you're in
trouble that would have just sort of
ramped things up
the capitol police were just having a
conversation you know if you
if you do this we'll we'll let you do
this you know don't do this
but you know do this completely control
their energy
really good in terms of persuasion and
police work
really really good just just drain the
energy out of it and
um but when you see the clip it's so
clear
i mean it could not be more clear that
at least
this group of protesters had nothing on
their mind
except being heard nothing else it
wasn't an
insurrection they weren't trying to hurt
anybody they weren't trying to take over
the capitol and it's completely clear
that this group you know some of the
ones who were most
famously photographed had no bad
intentions
right um now that doesn't say that other
people
were as free from bad intentions at all
all right ashley babbitt was going
through a window
and as tragic as that is
and i know you don't like this i think
it was a good shoot
meaning that it's she shouldn't have
been shot right
like we all wish the whole situation had
been different
but i think that the the police officer
who took that shot
has been cleared and i agree with that
actually
because if people are coming in with
that attitude
into the capitol
they bring it on themselves really i
mean i just can't have any
uh i don't have any more sympathy for
ashley babbitt
being shot than i would for somebody
resisting arrest
being killed i care about them on a
human level
but because they so it was so broad on
themselves i just can't
i can't make that my issue really
but certainly now and i guess part of
the story is john solomon who was
reporting
that uh the pelosi and the house are
going to vote
on some kind of 911 style commission to
probe the january 6th
what they call terrorist mob attack
let's see just got an emergency text
here
uh
i got to solve this right now somebody's
somebody's really
oh got it
all right
um problem solved
i'm a problem solver all right um
let's see what else we got going on here
kind of a
kind of a slow day
um that was what i wanted to talk about
today
does anybody have any uh questions
yeah i'm a problem solver that's what i
am i'm not a problem solver
so um i don't know if you've seen this
but there there does seem to be more and
more
um let's say feeling that our government
is not the right tool for the the last
part of the pandemic
and that the public is going to have to
just take a bigger responsibility
for ourselves as well as others number
one
um there does seem to be some question
about the efficacy of the first
shot so there is some question whether
that you know 93
is real or not and i think we need to
wait on that
um
okay apparently i did not solve that
emergency
and it is such an emergency that i have
to stop right now
like right now so i have to end this but
i will talk to you
tomorrow
