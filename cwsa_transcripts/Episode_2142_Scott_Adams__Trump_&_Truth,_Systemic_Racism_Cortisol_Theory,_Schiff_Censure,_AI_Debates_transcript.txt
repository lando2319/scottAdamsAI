good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to anybody in the history of the
universe it's called coffee with Scott
Adams and aren't you glad you're here
wow wow yeah and if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels where how
can I explain it what kind of a level
could we take this up to the level where
you could build
let's say a railroad from here to the
Indian Ocean that's how good it's going
to be and all you need is a cup of mug
or a glass of tanker Chelsea style and a
canteen sugar flaska vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything
awesome it's called the simultaneous 7
it happens now go
ah
yes all right we're private on locals
and we're public on
YouTube
and it's time to go
so did anybody notice that there's no
news
that the news just stopped if there if
there's anything that would tell you
that all the news is artificial
it's that as soon as summer vacation
comes
Susan celebration the news stops come on
doesn't that tell you the news is fake
that the news stops when the reporters
go on vacation
like how could that be
well
that's not going to stop me from talking
about things that are fascinating and
interesting and will make you so happy
that you're here
I don't know
I think it might be the best day you've
ever had in your life
now I'm going to be hypnotizing all of
you with casual conversation
here's what I'm going to do this this is
going to be very simple hypnosis
it's the simplest form of hypnosis
which is associating uh something with
another thing
have you noticed that your mood can be
influenced by other people you've all
noticed that right somebody sad comes
into the room and you're like oh your
energy goes down but somebody happy
comes into the room and all of a sudden
you're like whoa all right that took me
up a little bit well here's what I'm
going to do to all of you
I'm in a better mood than you are
that's true I'm in a great mood
and my good mood just by itself is going
to start to seep into your being
your mere exposure to my good happy mood
today will make you happier
you don't have to do anything
just sit there and let it happen
go
first story good news there's another
battery breakthrough
looks like uh who did this uh big old
car company uh who's uh maybe Toyota
doesn't matter it's one some it's a big
car company
they've got some new solid state battery
that's uh way cool it'll give you uh
almost a thousand mile range and 10
minute charge
does that sound pretty good
932 mile range and a 10 minute charge
and apparently it's all doable you know
the technology can be demonstrated it
looks like it can be scaled up for mass
production
and it's solid state
so it'd be lighter and well they can
pack more goodness into a smaller space
anyway compare that to Tesla Model y
that has one-third the range sort of and
15 minute charge 15 minutes not bad but
one-thirds range so this is not the only
battery breakthrough I I always tell you
about all the new battery brakes and
things because I think the battery
breakthrough
is everything
I mean correct me if I'm wrong but the
big problem with green energy is it
doesn't work when there's no sun and the
wind isn't blowing
but if your batteries get cheap enough
and awesome enough and here's a gigantic
step in that direction
then all problems are solved you just
store your energy until you need it
all right I'm loving the hashtag wannabe
dictator you know that came from the Fox
News Chiron hero
who who referred to Biden as a wannabe
dictator in in the last Chiron that he
did before he was let go
uh it's still the is still the best
it's the best quitting story I've ever
heard
nobody's ever quit a job better than
that that is the highest style points
for a job quitting there has ever been
in the history of the universe
uh
but I'd like to check in on the wannabe
dictator Biden's health
let's see uh he still wants to build a
railroad to the Indian Ocean and uh and
God Save the Queen
uh why do you say God Save the Queen
at the end of his speech
nobody really knows
[Laughter]
maybe it was something about trans and
lgbtq but I don't think so I I think it
was just some kind of a brave
dysfunction
but
you know I always tell you my mother
told me when I was young
that you could get used to anything if
you didn't long enough
including hanging and I don't think she
made that up I think that was an old
saying from somewhere
but have we gradually gotten used to how
degraded
uh Joe Biden is
is it my imagination or can you tell me
if I'm exaggerating
I I can't tell if this is hyperbole
but it seems to me that Biden is about
10 minutes from what I'll call the
Taxidermy phase
where they literally just stuff them and
wheel them around on a cart
and everybody acts like he's still there
because we're acting like he's still
there now
did could you ever imagined we would be
in this place
could you ever imagine that the
president would say in public God Saves
the queen randomly and and we want to
build a railroad to the Indian Ocean
and that we let those things go I mean
we talked about them they were both news
and we had fun with it and we tweeted we
made some memes but generally speaking
we just gave it a pass
we actually got used to having a
brainless president
now is my mother a genius
is my mother the smartest person who
ever lived when she said you could get
used to anything
I didn't believe that
I didn't believe you could get used to
anything
I thought it was like an exaggeration as
in well you can get used to some things
there are some things small group of
things that you might not think you
could get used to them but the small
group of things
actually you can you can get used to
them
but no it turns out you can get used to
anything anything
we're going to stuff this
like uh like a pet bear or whatever your
stuff we're going to wheel them around
in a cart
and the Marines are going to salute him
the Marines are going to salute they're
going to wheel this to the
helicopter on a cart
like this and the Marine the Marine
outside the helicopter will be
and everybody will act like nothing
happened
I don't know I think it's funny
um
apparently on June 22nd
I saw a clay Travis tweet on this on
June 22nd which is just a few days from
now Trump's exclusive contract with
truth social ends
meaning that he can tweet anywhere he
wants
anytime he wants at the moment he's
limited to truth now what do you think
he's going to do
because if if Trump starts tweeting on
Twitter
and it's the same tweets
why would anybody be on truth
I mean it might just destroy the entire
model if it's working at all so I don't
know if truth is
you know on the way to make money or not
but he's got a big decision because I
believe he's got a sizable Equity
interest in that he would like it to
work on the other hand he wants to be
president
you know I'm almost
semi-convinced that he should stay on
truth
for his presidential benefit do you know
why
because the less the people see of him
the better
but the people on truth are the people
who absolutely want to see him those are
the people who said I'm here to see you
give me more of you and then he gives it
to him and all the people on Twitter
would only benefit from less of it
am I wrong
they would only benefit from less of him
yeah people people do Retreat retweet
them but it doesn't get the same energy
like I I almost never see a Don Jr
actually I had never seen Don Jr's
tweets I just realized that Don Jr is
completely removed from my Twitter feed
yeah
on a side note
um the the stuff that is surfaced to me
on Twitter is so different than it used
to be
but I can tell that people I really
would like to see their tweets or just
go on
so why is it the people I follow I don't
see their tweets
like at all
isn't the whole point of following
somebody that you would see all of their
tweets
like in theory wouldn't I see a hundred
percent of his tweets right
but I don't remember the last time I've
seen one
so there's there's something going on
with the Twitter algorithm that's not
cool
because I'm following people and I'm not
seeing their tweets at all like zero
times what's up with that
I mean the most basic thing of Twitter
is you follow somebody so you can see
their stuff I don't follow things so
they can show me whatever the they
want
but that seems to be what's happening I
don't understand it at all
so anyway that needs to get fixed I
think so I saw a funny uh funny meme if
you call it that video that was an AI
version of Biden and Trump doing a
debate now it was a funny version where
they were just doing insults
but I thought to myself
suppose you've got two presidents who
don't want or two candidates who don't
want to debate could be in the primary
it could be anywhere else
how hard would it be
to create an AI deep fake of both of the
candidates uh train them both on all the
policies and all of the recent speeches
you don't you don't want to go back too
far but just say recent speeches you
know last two three years something
you don't think you could get the AIS to
do the debate and you would learn as
much
would you not learn as much as if you
saw the real people debate
because ask yourself what's the point of
a debate
what's the point of a debate
do you know the only thing we get out of
a debate
is fake gotchas
that's it
fake gotchas because in terms of policy
it's already published right their
policies are already in their websites
they say it every day so you could
certainly teach the AI
to answer any question about policy
have you used AI enough to know that
that's true
chat GPT would give you a perfect
impression of their policy preferences
and could answer a question
actually answer a question based on the
policies and it could give you a good
answer a very complete one with caveats
and everything else in fact it could do
it better than the candidates themselves
do you do you disagree
I think AI could represent its real
person better than the real person could
represent themselves
because the AI would not get flustered
the AI would not do a human thing that
you know shows his flaws
and AI would not forget what it was
going to say it would not get excited
about something it would not give the
stupid answer
and if it did give a stupid answer you
wouldn't blame the candidate you'd blame
the program
so it could actually make a mistake and
then the public wouldn't care they'd say
well that was just the AI that wasn't
the candidate
so you don't think that there will be a
debate between Biden and RFK Jr
prediction prediction there will be a
debate but it will be two AI characters
how much attention could a real debate
between two AI characters get like how
many how many views would that get
an actual let's say a one-hour debate
with real deep fakes real deep fakes
I believe it would get millions
yeah I think it would get millions
because I would not be less interested
in the AI version
I would be fascinated to see how the AI
handled their their two competing uh
deals
there are some of you wouldn't watch it
and I get that but it would be really
interesting I think a lot of people
would watch it now that's another that's
interesting too
the Deep fake
here's what I would do if I made the
Deep fake of RFK Jr
I would start with his actual voice as
it is today
and then in Fairly sure time I would
improve it as he talks
so that you you'd almost not notice that
the imperfections start to decrease and
then say five minutes in
it just disappears and you're just
listening to everybody else's voice
that would be cool now it might also be
insensitive
to people with disabilities
do you see that
I think it would be insensitive to take
his disability away
in in a public forum
yeah because that would be sort of like
saying you have to change him to make
him better or something like that I
don't know I feel like people with
actual other disabilities might be
insulted
just by the fact that the AI thought I
needed to fix it you know what I mean
am I all alone on this I think I'm all
alone on that I
I feel like there's a sensitivity there
where we should accept him the way he is
not imagine that we need to fix them in
our minds
I might be a little sensitive to this
because I had the same issue with my
voice
so I might be a little tightly wound on
that topic
all right I'd love to see it though
so I guess Juneteenth is uh
Monday is the celebration of Juneteenth
which I understand to me the last day
that slavery was legal in an American
state
now what do you think of juneteen
Juneteenth
do you think it in Texas specifically
and what do you think of that should we
have that holiday or are you against it
anybody opposed to it
yeah I see people saying F that and
blah blah blah
all right
um I want to tell you how easily I was
persuaded
all right I have to admit I went into it
with a little bit of all right this
might be a little over woke you know
what I mean because if you read enough
right-leading media
there's like a little bit of a sense
that maybe it's
a little unnecessary
a little too much a little too for one
group
maybe a little too woke
and I have to admit I was leading in
that direction I didn't I had no problem
with it I mean I didn't have a
disagreement with it I just thought you
know sign of the times it's a sign of
the times now I saw a quick video clip
of apparently the woman who seems to be
behind it becoming a big deal in the
United States so it's a black woman she
looks like a grandmother now
um and she was taught and it was just a
little clip
uh probably a 10 second clip of her
making her point
and in 10 seconds
she completely changed my mind
and I'm gonna quote her roughly
paraphrase and I'm gonna see if I can do
the same to you
so she's talking to the crowd about the
importance of Juneteenth and she says
something like this rough quote
it's not about black it's not about
white it's about America it's an America
celebration
sold
don't say anything else
do you know what I always talk about uh
don't keep selling past the sale
once you've closed the sale shut up
shut up you just made the sale
it's about America so
good I'm all in 100
sold the person who came up with it
tells me it's about America
yep I'm in
so let's celebrate that on June 19th
all right uh here's my bottom line at
the moment on those Mar-A-Lago boxes
see if you agree with these following
statements
professional lawyers
the best lawyers in the world
cannot agree whether a crime of any
importance was committed true or false
there are definitely top lawyers who say
yes
but are there not also top lawyers who
say no or maybe
so without without saying whether it is
a crime or is not
can we simply agree that the biggest
experts on what is a crime can't tell
meaning they don't agree I mean if you
ask them they say they can tell but they
don't agree
and now number two
I think you can agree on that
number two
the public is unlikely ever to see the
documents
to judge for ourselves whether these are
important Secrets they got released and
now not saying that we should
somebody on Twitter
like a very dumb person on Twitter said
are you saying that we should see all of
these secret documents
no no I'm not saying we should
I'm saying we won't
in all likelihood
in all likelihood because if the
documents were so unimportant that they
could just declassify them today
then that would take away the whole
point of the case
not the whole point but it would it
would weaken the case because that would
be an admission there was nothing there
of importance they just showed the
public
but can you live with this situation
that might be developing
can you imagine
putting the a past president and current
candidate
in prison
for life
for something that the best lawyers
can't even agree is a crime
and the public is not allowed to see the
uh the most important part of the
evidence
can you even imagine it
honestly I can't
I actually can't imagine that like
actually can't like when I say I can't
imagine it I mean my imagination
literally can't concoct it I can't I
can't play it as like a little movie in
my head it's just too far
so this is what I mean by too far
that's just too far
and so what I say is not going to happen
I don't mean you know I'm going to do
some personal thing that would make it
not happen I mean it's not up to me
I'm saying it's not going to happen
because one way or another the country
won't let that happen
we won't let it happen
collectively
and and I don't have to say you know
what will the country do you know what
will be the response I don't think we're
talking about you know an armed
armed uh revolutionary thing yeah
nothing violent I'm just saying no
no
absolutely not
that's just too far
and
whatever it takes to make that stop
short of violence we don't need that but
whatever it takes
yeah I don't know it might be extremes
of obedience
yeah I I was
sort of uh
half seriously saying that you know
people who might stop paying taxes but
realistically it's kind of hard to do
that
I think something would happen
I think something would happen
it wouldn't surprise me if everybody who
had a gun decided to uh March down the
street with it
yeah imagine how scary that would be if
just everybody who had a gun just took
it out and just started marching down
the street
didn't say anything
no words necessary
just take all the guns out if you got
three guns takeable and just walk down
the street all together
now that's not a suggestion
I'm using that as a example of there's
probably something that the public would
do
but there's no way they're going to let
that happen there's just no way
that with what we know today
they're going to put him in prison
so I would see it as more of a political
move to try to suppress his electron
election chances but I'll tell you
uh here's how I read the room
I think Trump is getting more popular
every day
and some of it has to do with the fact
that the media is reducing his
visibility
I think it's working for him they're
reducing his visibility at the same time
they're sucking all the energy from the
other candidates is sort of the perfect
situation
because they can't stop talking about
them
but they're they're trying to keep the
the talking about them in this little
narrow area of his bad behavior as they
see it
except that so many people don't see it
as that bad
that they're spending all the time in
the thing that people really don't give
a give a about do you think there's
actually a Democrat who cares about his
Mar-A-Lago boxes
like actually really care
like even one in the whole world
do you think there's one you know what
would be funny to see if you could get
that person to say it on video
hey uh what do you think about these
Mara logo boxes
well
I believe we'll need to bring somebody
in for that
uh Dale
uh what do you think of uh president
Trump and those moral locks Mar-A-Lago
boxes it's a pretty bad worst thing in
the world worst thing in the world
worst thing in the world
is it worse than inflation
it's not worth the inflation but second
worst thing in the world
is it worse than potential nuclear war
over Ukraine not worse than that third
worst thing in the world
is it worse than
the high unemployment it's not worse
than that but it's the fifth worst thing
in the world
and then just keep going
and you get to see where where Dale
takes his stand all right
this is the farthest I'm gonna go it's
the 27th most important thing in the
world
what about climate change 28th 28th most
important thing in the world
and so it goes but seriously you know
joking aside do you think you could get
an actual regular human being
on you know on video
to say yeah
I'll tell you those Mar-A-Lago boxes are
keeping me up at night I was worried
about the climate frying the world
I was worried about nuclear Holocaust
because of the Ukraine war
but not anymore not anymore now it's the
Mar-A-Lago boxes I can't tell you about
the nightmares I've had about the boxes
and when I imagined in my mind Trump
rustling papers and talking about
Secrets oh no no this sound
yeah here's some Secrets here's some
Secrets I just hear it in my mind and it
makes me crazy
I mean in all seriousness wouldn't it be
funny to get somebody to try to tell you
that they really care about the boxes
that they actually care about them
that would be hilarious
because at first they say yes but then
you push him on him yeah where is this
where is it in your list of priorities
if you were to compare the moral logo
boxes to let's say
the health of your family
is it higher than that or you can see
where that would go
get back in the Box Dale
all right
um
one of the things I've been waiting to
see is something that uh famous investor
Bill Ackerman wants to see as well
you're aware that uh Joe Rogan did an
extensive interview with RFK Jr and RFK
Jr made a number of claims about
vaccinations and cell phone calls and uh
being bad for you and
um
basically vaccinations and some other
things
so
if you're just listening to one person
make claims they would be very
persuasive
have I ever taught you that listening to
One lawyer
talk about their case tells you
absolutely nothing about the truth
nothing about the truth because a lawyer
by training
and that's why RFK Jr is he they're
trained to give you their version of
things and they're trained to make you
sound persuasive as hell until you hear
the other side
it's hearing the other side where
everything falls apart
so there's a three-hour Joe Rogan was
that a useful Service to America
do you think because I consider Joe
Rogan a National Treasure one of the
most useful useful citizens America has
ever produced and his show is a you know
it's a force of nature
all right but everybody who said that's
useful useful you were so wrong oh my
God you're wrong you could not be more
wrong
there's nothing more destructive than
three hours of one lawyer's opinion
in fact if you were to make a list of
the worst things you could ever
do that would be it
that's the worst thing you could do
so I would say that the Joe Rogan
three hours with RFK was damaging to the
country
that was just bad for the country
absolutely bad really bad like
seriously seriously bad it's like one of
the worst things has happened this year
now am I saying the RFK was wrong about
anything
nope nope you didn't hear that that was
not in my opinion
do I think he's probably wrong about
some things he claims
I would put a really big bet on that
because when I listen to him talk I hear
a lot of correlation that he thinks is
causation
and I can't I just can't buy into that
I understand the correlation and I
understand it would be worth looking
into I agree with that completely
but
to assume that we know something because
of correlation is a really big ask and I
can't get there so here's what would
have been useful
what would have been really useful is
somebody who had the same amount of
knowledge as RFK Jr has
but has a different point of view
and have both of them on for three hours
and one says Acclaim the other says what
they think then maybe
you would have something good for the
country
but whether you but whether Joe Rogan
had RFK Jr on or somebody just as
powerful who had completely opposite
points of view my opinion would be the
same
it wouldn't matter if you had an RFK
Junior for three hours or somebody
disagreed with everything you said for
three hours if you have them on by
themselves with just Joe Rogan
that is a huge mistake and a disservice
to the country a very big one it's a
really big disservice and I think uh
because I love I love me some Joe Rogan
as most of you do
and uh so you know I have the ultimate
respect for everything he's doing
but that's a real big mistake in terms
of benefit to the country it's real good
for Ratings you know it's good for
you know entertainment but in terms of
informing the country it's a disaster
it's a disaster
and not because RFK is wrong you get
that right
I'm not saying RFK Jr is wrong
I'm saying if you don't put the other
side when when there is such a big other
side if you don't put them on there at
the same time you are misinforming the
public period
periods that's just propaganda
at that point now it's accidental
there's no way that Joe Rogan is like
intentionally trying to mislead people
there's no way that's true that we've
all watched it long enough we know he's
pretty dedicated to what's true
so there's no way he's trying to do
anything that's misleading it just works
out that way that's just the outcome
so I would bet there's a whole bunch of
people who were very persuaded by RFK Jr
and you shouldn't I have been
and I don't mean because his arguments
are not good because they're actually
quite good his arguments are very very
persuasive sounding I just can't judge
them
um
yeah you would be very very poorly
served if you watch that in fact it's
the reason I didn't watch it I saw some
clips and I said I'm not going to watch
this this is not good
this does not help anybody
all right however I love the fact that
RFK Jr will go anywhere and talk to
anybody he can do it without notes he
can do it persuasively he's impressive
as hell
so let me say that RFK Jr impressive as
hell
doesn't mean he's right
and I've got some big questions about
that
but impressive
all right I did see a Twitter user
called bad stats
and I retweeted it if you're looking for
it in which he went through and tried to
um I'm going to use the word debunk but
since I don't know which one is right
don't don't assume that the debunker is
the right one I'm just using that as a
shorthand so somebody who disagreed
and it was a long thread in which he
went through various things and showed
showed his work so that was useful
if the only thing you saw was RFK Jr on
on Joe Rogan you should see somebody
who's got a different opinion and some
knowledge
pushing back on it
the pushback is just as strong
right if you listen to RFK Jr by himself
you're totally persuaded because he's
very persuasive
as soon as you see the thread that calls
out you know some let's say
I don't want to say flaws but a
different opinion on on the same
situation
you completely change your mind you're
like oh I didn't know that oh really
really that's a correlation not a
causation oh
but then you look at the debunk and you
say to yourself okay there's one part of
this debunk that I know looks like
 and then you say to yourself
all right who's behind this debunking is
it big Pharma so you never really can
get to full confidence I'm just saying
if you haven't seen both sides you've
seen nothing
all right I have a theory of systemic
racism
that uh cortisol levels
could be measured to find out where
systemic racism is bad and then you
could use that that knowledge
to know what to do about it now cortisol
is the chemical released when you're
under stress
and what happens is if your cortisol
level goes up
uh
John are you stupid I can't tell
uh let's let's figure out if John is
stupid here's what he says is Scott
Scott big issues with RFK but little
mountain with his argument is because he
refuses to hear him speak
so somebody's saying that my refusing to
hear one side
is making me dumb
whereas my only point was you should
hear both sides
but you think that refusing to hear one
side by itself makes me dumb
job
do better do better John you can do
better than that
um
who who argues against hearing both
sides of an argument
besides John
all right
um
cortisol
so if your cortisol levels are high it
lowers your cognitive function did you
know that
if you're stressed you actually can't
think as well you don't you and if it's
long term long term you're you're just
not going to do as well in school
so your academic performance your your
actual IQ will drop if you have enough
cortisol for long enough so that's based
on stress now where would cortisol be
highest
where do you think would be the highest
cortisol well I'll speculate
I would imagine if you were poor
you would have higher cortisol there's
at least one study that shows a strong
correlation so poverty alone would give
you higher cortisol but also I would
think living in a high crime area
you know dangerous neighborhood hi
cortisol I suppose
logically if you had one parent you
might feel a little more anxious than if
you had to if they were you know two
good parents who were taking care of you
you'd feel a little a little less safe
so you can imagine a whole host of
things that would make you have high
cortisol if you lived in some Urban high
density high crime area
doesn't that almost perfectly explain
the situation that the people who are in
the in the place that creates high
cortisol
are the ones who are performing poorly
they're not doing as well in school
now I'm not saying that's the one one
thing that's causing it I'm saying that
it's a really big thing
and if we were to only measure the
cortisol levels in let's say the entire
black population versus the entire white
population that would tell you
what the difference is on people's
actual reality their bodies
because because if black people in
general
are having high cortisol situations just
goes to where they live mostly
you would expect that would be a huge
drag on performance
but it would also give you something to
fix
or at least something to test so you
could test the cortisol Theory fairly
easily by taking some you know random
black kids out of an urban area
putting them in a let's say a nicer
environment remove all the danger
so just put them in a no dangerous
situation where they still have a path
to success
just see what happens
first of all see if there are cortisol
levels go down
so that's the first thing you test
and I think it would and then you test
if if that seemed to be correlated with
better academic achievement
probably would
yeah now you know you also have other
influences of the inner city drugs and
Etc right
so
um but I'm going to dovetail this into
my bigger point which is uh the big the
big secret of personal success
is to decouple what is true
from what works
and that's totally counterintuitive and
I think it's one of the biggest problems
in the world is that that's
counterintuitive and it's been my sort
of my recent life's work you know the
second half of my life has been
specifically on this
the this illusion the illusion that you
have to focus on what's true
as opposed to what works
and here's the perfect example of it
systemic racism
is true
right now I think that there's a
systemic poverty problem
that's you know the bigger part of it so
if you're a poor anything
if you're just poor that's going to have
an effect on your generation maybe the
next one too so
but systemic racism is real right so if
you say but what's true
is systemic racism true yes does have an
impact on some people yes
so what do you do about that it's true
has an impact so that's where you put
your resources right that's the thing
you fix because it's true
and it has a negative effect so you
should go fix that thing that makes
common sense right that's
straightforward here's my problem here's
the solution everybody agrees the
trouble is that gets you a terrible
outcome
sorry I'm sorry the truth gets you a bad
outcome
so if you want a good outcome
you have to go a different direction
which is you don't ignore the truth the
systemic racism exists so you don't
ignore it you just find a way to slice
through it which is to focus on personal
success strategies make sure that you go
to school even if other people don't
make sure you don't get on drugs even if
other people do you know basic stuff
stay off of drugs don't get anybody
pregnant don't get pregnant too early
you know build a talent stack systems
over goals you know make sure your sleep
and your diet or on point I mean the the
methods for being successful or have
always been the same
you know they improve a little bit over
time
but how to do it is pretty well defined
people do understand how to be
successful
the trouble is if you're focusing on
what's true
you're going to go the wrong direction
you're going to feel a victim
do you know what happens if somebody
tells you you're a victim and somebody
tells you that you're a victim of
discrimination
it raises your cortisol levels
it would be another form of stress all
stress raises your cortisol
so telling people that there is systemic
racism and it could hold them back
should make them fail
everything we know about everything
says that telling people that they have
an obstacle they can't easily get past
will make them fail
however everything we know about the
world suggests that if you tell people
that nothing can stop them which is what
it's a lie
that's a lie of course things can stop
you
there's a lot of stuff that can stop you
stop you writing your tracks
but if you act as though that's not true
when it's clearly true
your result will be way better
because you're going to push through the
smaller you're going to push through the
smaller problems you're going to say
well there's a door in front I mean it's
locked I guess I'm done here systemic
racism it's a locked door what can I do
but if you told yourself that nothing
could stop you
you'd find the case myth you'd figure
out how to pick a lock you'd go to the
gym until you kick that door down
and then you would kick it down
and then there'd be another obstacle and
then you say ah another obstacle just
like I expected and then you dismantle
the the wall one brick at a time and you
go to the next one that's life
that's life
now here's the biggest problem with
systemic racism in my opinion
I was raised to believe that that's
exactly how I was raised to believe that
I could push through any obstacle
were you
how many of you were raised that way to
believe that you could push through
whatever you needed to push through
and I'll bet you all the people saying
yes did okay in life you know you
probably raised a family
took care of your retirement I'll bet
you did and I'll bet you if you looked
at the population of people who told
they couldn't succeed because of this
big old racist country that's working
against them I'll bet they didn't do so
well
and I'm sure there are lots of reasons
for the differences in performance
across groups there are lots of reasons
but I'll bet if you just removed this
one thing you'd have the biggest you'd
have the biggest Improvement
if you could just convince people that
yeah systemic racism exists and you can
slice through it like it doesn't
is that true
it's true enough it's true enough for
the purpose that you want it to be which
is to inspire people to do the best but
it's not true true
you know like true true capital T true
and you know that kind of true
because Iraq could fall on your head and
kill you
right a drunk driver could hit you
tomorrow
no you can't do anything that you want
to do all the time
but if your mindset is that you can
you're going to do better
so there's no way to separate the the
the fact
that personal success
requires believing or acting as if you
believe is something that's absolutely
not true
you get that right does everybody get
that the personal success requires you
to accept that which you know not to be
true
that you can do anything
you can't do anything you can't flap
your wings and fly
but you can get through most problems
you can solve most problems that is true
and I would even go further and say that
if you were let's say a black American
you could take advantage of the various
advantages that everybody has in
different categories right your your
personal Advantage might be different
than mine
so my advantage might be that uh let's
say I could get a job with a bunch of
racists
if I'm the same color
but you could so there'd be little
pockets of things where I've got an
advantage but then if I went to a
Fortune 500 company who's trying to
improve their diversity and we walk in
with the same qualifications for the
same job
black guy gets it every time
every time 100 of the time the black guy
is going to get the job equal equal
qualifications because he's a twofer the
black guy's a twofer but I'm a one for
I give them just a good employee I hope
but the black guy gives him a good
employee and solves their diversity
problem a little bit it's a twofer of
course they're going to pick the twofer
why wouldn't they
you would be an idiot if you didn't I
would I would do the same thing
so
everybody's got an advantage you just
have to find it
instead of complaining about the other
person having an advantage which they do
all right
um
apparently this atom shift Center which
I was opposed to when it included a 16
million dollar fine but I guess it's
going to be reintroduced without the
monetary part so it'll just get censored
which I think should be enough to get
all of the Republicans to vote for it so
I think there's a good chance you'll get
us injured and I think this is a far
better outcome because I don't want to
set that precedent of Congress finding
each other
like that would just be the end of any
useful Congress if they're useful at all
right here's the latest on Ukraine
uh Ukraine is just such a weird thing to
talk about because there's such a lack
of information
but uh now there's talk of uh giving
Ukraine what they would call Israel
status
Israel status
meaning
that with Israel we give them permanent
ongoing regular military assistance just
sort of forever
and the idea is that instead of coming
up with you know specific funding for
Ukraine for a specific war that they
would become our let's say military
um dependent forever
yeah we we must be pretty dumb
we must be pretty dumb
I don't really understand what's going
on there
it's got to be that the neocons are just
trying to destroy Russia and they just
don't want to say it directly although
they do say it directly some of them
yeah the the whole idea of making
Ukraine NATO
unless well let me put this way
if we could destroy Russia
than making Ukraine dato might make some
sense I suppose just to keep the lid on
the thing you destroyed
but if you're not going to destroy
Russia
it doesn't seem like a good idea to keep
you know keep attacking it with more and
more NATO surrounding it
feels like a really bad idea
yeah it feels like the military
industrial complex just wants another
permanent piggy bank
and there you go
make Russia the 51st state
yeah all right
um so that should be alarming
and then here's the the news from the
Ukraine counter-offensive
and remember I've taught you that if
there are too many explanations for a
thing
all you know is that nobody knows about
the thing
right listen to how many explanations
there are of what's happening over there
because the counter-offensive is moving
very slowly right there's almost nothing
happening in terms of change of prop of
territory
a little bit but nothing important and
so one take on it is that what the
ukrainian's doing is a strategy of
testing all the the front line and as
they're testing they're learning and
really the testing phase is a legitimate
military strategy in which you test test
and then once you find the weak spot
then you Mass it you mess up and you go
through the weak spot
so is that what's happening are they
probing are they probing and learning
maybe that's one possibility the other
is that they're uh they're waiting for
the Russians to make mistakes and
because the Russian military always
makes mistakes all you really have to do
is get them to react
so simply getting them to react will
cause them to make mistakes and then you
let them make their mistakes
another take is that
uh what the ukrainians were doing was
trying to wipe out the Russian
conscripts first instead of going after
big assets that they were going after
troops because if they could kill enough
of the troops it would have a
devastating effect on the psychology of
the Russian citizens who might try to
stop the war
and the other is uh yeah it's really all
about cutting off Crimea
and making it look like you know they
better negotiate because you know that
would be a big win if they could do it
so
how many billions of dollars are we
given to Ukraine and our press can't
tell us what the strategy is
now are you bothered by that
now I'm not sure that I want the press
to know you know detailed military
strategy because then the other side
would now too
but
don't you feel that for our billions and
billions of dollars we should have some
idea what they're trying to do over
there
are they really trying to win
or are they trying to just negotiate
better
or is the entire thing about creating a
permanent system so our
military-industrial complex can just
feed weapons there forever
I have no idea what we're doing there
but I know it's expensive
so it just to me it looks like nothing
but a military industrial complex play
that has nothing to do with American
interests
that's what it looks like to me
it's hard for me to be in favor of this
war because I just don't see the reasons
so yeah it looks like a money grab to me
which will kill millions of people
just like usual
in other words
you can get used to anything
we actually watch this happening
and then we just go to lunch
there are too many outrages I feel like
when the Vietnam War was on
the the total number of outrages was
not not that many
so you could really get mad about this
one thing oh this war but now we've got
everything from climate change to you
know January 6 Insurrection and things
that they make up every day that are not
even real problems
that any one problem it's hard I can't
muster enough outrage
we're spending billions of dollars in a
war that's probably only making us more
you know more at risk
and I I can't even get outraged because
everything else is outrageous at the
same time
it's a cortisol industry yeah
gold diffusion I think it's outrage
diversification
outraged diffusion right
that now by the way I think that's a
real thing the outrage delusion
that we're just outrageous so many
things we can't be outraged in anything
enough
yeah outrage delusion
not a saturation
my hypnosis is failing
yeah I think it's my problem
uh call everyone a Nazi
rage diversity
all right
uh is there anything else happening it's
another
slow news day but that's the end of my
prepared comments
have you noticed that your mood has
improved or did all the news make you
feel sad
how Amazon locks you out of your house
if the driver accuses you of racism
oh can Amazon do that
lock you out of your own house
I've never heard that story
I bummed you out
well
oh yeah there's a story about uh Joe
Biden
uh grabbing some side boob of Eva
longorian
and the the video showing the slow
motion of her grabbing his hands you
know he goes in for the hug but then he
you know he slides his hands past her
side boob on the way out and she grabs
his hands and twists his thumb over he
has hands his hands back to him
all right
um
black owner locked out by Amazon wow
Amazon locked the smart home device
oh he just locked them out of his
devices and his yeah okay
yeah I'm sure that's happened to him
before that's that's true
I did watch the Black Mirror episode so
there's a new episode of Black Mirror
uh that let's say it deals with uh the
simulation idea but in a
in a very clever way
you could see you can see it coming
but it was still super clever really
good writing a great show I watched it
last night it was terrific
that's what I've seen actually of the
black mirrors it's the best episode I've
seen
uh also good acting good writing good
acting was really well done
all right
uh Black Mirror is on Netflix
all right
um what about Peter zayanteca and Russia
and dating I haven't I haven't catch up
to with Peter zahan lately what's he
saying about
is he saying that Russia is totally
definitely going to win
do you think anybody knows that
do you think there's anybody in the
world who can tell you where the Ukraine
thing is going other than it's going to
be roughly the same now as it will be
later
all right here's my prediction
that neither side can win
and they will they'll have to negotiate
now it might be after Ukraine
maybe put some threat on Crimea
because some people are saying that that
Putin can't risk losing Crimea
so if it comes down to it looks like
they do have a lock on taking Crimea
back the Putin will get flexible in his
negotiating because if he could
negotiate to keep Crimea he can claim
something good happens at least he kept
Crimea
but uh I don't see any way that the
I don't see any way that the war ends
and anything that looks like a victory
it has to turn into either a permanent
war or a DMZ or a negotiating settlement
I think I think Putin's too smart to
have a permanent DMZ
I think nobody wins with that so I think
he would negotiate because I think he's
not crazy
do you remember in the early part of the
war when all the propaganda told us that
Putin was sick and maybe crazy
do you remember that
and and from today's perspective doesn't
isn't that really obvious that you were
being propagandized by your own your own
country
that was such propaganda
it doesn't look like any of that was
true or even a little bit true it's
yeah I I said it too probably but the uh
but what it looks like is that now we
have a better understanding of how the
Ukraine thing emerged
it looks like Putin was pushed into his
position by NATO
and it looks like he was acting somewhat
rationally the entire time
and I'm not sure we were
you know if you're going to argue who is
being irrational it looked like looked
like my team it looked like my team was
the irrational ones that's what it looks
like now that didn't look like that in
the beginning in the beginning it looked
like Putin all bad
Putin bad Putin bad Boot and crazy he'll
use his nukes
yeah none of that was true that
basically the Democrats did to Putin
what they did to Trump
which is a accused Putin of their own
crimes of being the aggressors it's
exactly what they do to Trump exactly
the same thing
you were told
can we do the thing where you pretend
that I was wrong and you told me the
right thing all along which never
happened
we're going to pretend that right
would it would it help you if I give you
a husband an apology and pretend that I
didn't know that and that you told me
and that now I'm just figuring you down
could we do that let's do a husband
apology because the people on YouTube
earn sort of a different headspace I'd
like to apologize
forever having thought that Putin was
insane and that it was all his fault
so you have my apology I'm sorry honey
uh if it made you feel bad I didn't mean
that and I will buy you a nice diamond
are we good now
husband apology
given and accepted
all right
I'll tell you if you don't think husband
apologies should be used in politics
you're wrong they work every time
yeah if you feel better now good
all right uh that's all for now YouTube
talk to you tomorrow
bye for now
