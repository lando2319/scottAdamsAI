well let's see if anybody is alive today
you're all pretty glued to your TV sets
right
now but uh come on in here we're going
to watch the uh verdict
together let me bring up locals so I can
see you separately
we're mostly just going to be waiting
for the
verdict we'll be
speculating we'll be speculating and
waiting all right there we go
locals so let's uh read some tea leaves
just for fun
uh we'll keep an eye on whether there's
any uh I'll go to audio if there's
anything that actually happens but I
think when when we
uh get the jury back in the courtroom I
think there's a whole process they have
to go through so even though it's only
maybe 10 or 15 minutes until they get in
get back I think they all have to be uh
each of them individually asked if they
have to
toally thinks
guilty so there are two
possibilities it could be that there's a
guilty could be maybe guilty of
misdemeanors only I don't know if that's
a
possibility
or uh or the
possibility that there was a one of my
audience members in the jury
do you think one of my audience members
going to flip them to a
quiddle because I could
have I could have flipped the entire
room I'll tell you
how all right here's the
deal there's so much wrong with this
case that there isn't the slightest
chance I'm going to vote to convict you
can spend as much time here as you want
but it's not going to happen a hung
jewry will make things worse for the
country whatever we do it needs to be
unanimous I can get you to unanimous
acquittal on these charges which even
you don't think are important in any way
and by the way Trump's polls Trump's
support will go up if you convict and by
the way he's not going to jail under any
conditions and he's not getting out of
the race so I can give you an
option I can give you an option where we
can get home for the weekend
and we can help the country
heal but there's no other option because
I will stay here for six
months so it's
possible that there was a strong jury
member who flipped him for practical
reasons here's here's what I would have
said hey hey everybody did anybody
really understand the case or what was
being
charged uh no no no then do we need to
talk about anything else CU they had two
weeks to tell us what the charge was and
none of us know when we came in this
room does anybody feel comfortable
convicting when we've been listening to
the charges for two weeks and we don't
know what they are does anybody feel
comfortable with that does anybody think
that that was proven Beyond A Reasonable
Doubt just raise your hand I I could
have flipped that jury to a quiddle in
five
minutes no matter what they thought when
they walked in the
room
so if there's somebody on the
jury who is one of me and there might
be it could be a quiddle I'm not going
to I'm not going to predict it so I
don't I don't predict a
quiddle but it's definitely one of the
possibilities uh the there there's no
way to know from you know what little
information we
have well I think they should have going
with if the Packer doesn't fit you must
acquit
no Trump table looks
sad well even crazy people will vote
their own self-interest I'll tell you
one thing that the jury does
know everybody who hates Trump knows
that a guilty verdict makes him stronger
at this point don't you think they went
home and heard from their
relatives you know you're going to get
them elected right you know you bastards
are going to go in there you're going to
vote guilty it's going to be so
obviously corrupt that you're
guaranteeing the biggest Landslide of
all time you're not just going to get
him elected you're going to get him a
what do they call a
mandate basically this is a this is a
vote on a
mandate it looks like it's a jury trial
with a
verdict but maybe it's a little bit more
deciding whether it will be a l
Landslide or a normal
Victory you know there was really no
chance whatsoever that my Garder would
not start using the leaf blower directly
below my window when I went live there
was really no chance that wasn't going
to happen there he
is right below my
window do you know how many hours in the
week there
are and I could say with certainty that
the leaf blower would be below my window
right
now I think I'm I just caused that by
hoping it didn't
happen yeah the M the microphone's
pretty directional we should be fine I
can barely hear myself but
microphone's pretty
directional you really don't hear it it
it's like there's a chaina in the room
with me right now and you don't hear
it so do you know why I'm up here
instead of in my man
cave the reason I'm here is because this
is the quiet room literally it's like
I'm sitting next to a uh hold on
for
so uh The Gardener assistant was working
on the black Park scam if any of you
ever fallen for the black bark
scam I follow for it every
year it goes like this you know this
part of your landscape would look much
better if we put some of this black bark
down there and I think hm I'll bet it
would I've seen that black bark and that
looks good so I say yes and they put
that black bark in there and that looks
good the next week they come and they
take their leaf blower they remove the
leaf from the black bark area as well as
little bit of the black bark if they do
their job just right they can sell you
black bark once a year and then every
month after that they can blow it away
until you have to buy some
more because the problem is it really
doesn't look good without the black
bark so their business model is
great so then I learned then I learned
there's two kinds of bark
there's a spider
barkk and I was told that the spider
bark is
brown but I didn't want Brown and the
other bark is black and I thought I like
the black I get the spider the spider
bark will click stick to the ground so
the leaf blower doesn't blow it
away and only this
year I finally found out that there's
such a thing as black spider bark
so they're trying to blow away my black
spider bark which in theory will will
will hold
on so anyway do we have
a verdict reach jury is entering the
courtroom let's turn up Jake Tapper see
what he
says jury was out for six days I'm not
comparing the two but that was another
high-profile this was not even 12 hours
right this is a very complicated case I
mean I do think it's interesting that
they told the judge that they have a
verdict but then asked for additional
time to fill out the form you agree with
Karen's assment I do and I also think
that they did that because um you know
they would normally just say we have the
verdict I haven't I haven't seen where
they have asked for additional time but
I think they were looking at the clock
and saying hey if we don't tell the
judge now he's going to send us home we
won't and the jurors and the jur and the
jury alternates there are six alternates
as well all 18 of them are now in the
courtroom Tim please continue I'm sorry
so I think that they wanted to let the
judge know hey don't don't don't dismiss
us for the day let's get it done today
I'll tell you right now this is the most
stressful moment and when they read this
verdict the majority of defendants that
I've represented at this moment it's so
pressurized they can't hear their ears
shut down and especially when you have
this many counts you're gonna have to
have one of the lawyers you know taken
it down and a complicated case when
they're done and and they say this is
the verdict Donald Trump is going to
turn to his lawyers and he's going to
say what did they say so the judge just
turned to the jurors and said we
received a note from you signed by your
jury for person at 4:20 p.m. 4:20 here
come the verdicts we have the verdicts
420 okay here it comes count one is
guilty that a felony charge count one
falsifying business arest count two also
guilty falsifying business records in
the first degree count three guilty
falsifying business records in the first
degree count four guilty that's another
felony charge falsifying business
records in the first degree count five
guilty that's another falsifying
business record in the first degree
felony charge those so that is five
felony charges uh that Donald Trump has
been found guilty by this New York jury
uh we still have 29 other felony counts
to go but that is five guilty um
verdicts by this jury when it comes to
um when it comes to falsify felony
charges of falsifying business records
in the first degree in service of
another crime uh and that crime would be
uh covering up the Stormy Daniels hush
money payment count six guilty so that
is six charges count seven guilty that
is another charge uh count eight guilty
that is yet another charge eight out of
eight he has been found guilty
count nine
guilty so that is nine out of nine count
10 guilty another felony charge
falsifying business records in the first
degree count 11 guilty another felony
charge of falsifying business records in
the first degree count 12 guilty another
felony charge falsifying business
records in the first degree count 13
guilty another felony charge of false
white business records in the first
degree count 14
guilty count 15 guilty that is 15 out of
15 so far I assume count all of them
Donald Trump found guilty 16 out of 16
uh when it comes to false fying business

first degree count 24 guilty another

left count 33 former president Donald
Trump found guilty false sign business
records count 34 are they going to
handcuff him guilty Donald Trump found
guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying
business records in the first degree all
34 are felonies they Donald Trump has
now been convicted of 34 different
felony crimes by a jury of his peers in
Manhattan 34 felony charges for former
president president Donald J Trump
convicted of 34 felony charges having to
do with falsifying business records to
cover up hush money payments to Stormy
Daniels uh an unbelievable moment in
American history uh they the jurors are
now being asked uh about their agreement
with these charges and they are
responding yes Trump has a frowned
expression on his face as the verdict
reading is completed he is not moving
the for the former president of the
United States now a convicted felon
having been found guilty of 34 felony
charges by a jury of his peers in
Manhattan New York the court officer has
asked if either party wants the jury ped
Trump attorney Todd blanch says yes this
is when they go around and ask each
juror if they agree with what has just
been read by the forers the jurors all
have straight faces they are now being
pulled Karen when they do this do they
ask each juror for each charge for each
count or do they or would they simplify
it and say to each of the 12 jurors do
you agree you convict him on all 34
charges in this particular instance
because it was a clean sweep of all 34
what they're going to take him into
number one you just heard that there was
just a 34 count all guilty is that at
your verdict and they would say yes sir
number two juror's being pulled right
now they all said yes or yes it is and
they are each going as you just said
Karen juror number one is this your
conclusion yes it is juror number two is
this your conclusion yes it is um and
the um Al to the alternate jurors judge
Maran said we couldn't have done this
without you he thanks all of the jurors
very much for their service in this case
uh Trump is turning to look over the
jurors as they're being pulled uh the
former president president of the United
States Donald J Trump the presumptive
Republican Presidential nominee a
convicted felon 34 times over found
guilty of falsifying business records in
the first degree by a jury of his peers
in Manhattan minutes ago Anderson boy
did they up uh Jake as you said it
is a remarkable uh moment in American
history I'm here with Caitlyn Collins
and CNN Paul Reed who have been covering
this uh obviously from uh the the
beginning uh the judge has said that he
will meet uh privately with all the
jurors just question I want to believe
that Americans believe in Justice and I
think that in their gut uh they
realize this country where the jurors
each one stands up and is counts as a
citizen and it who was forced to fight
and want that
well how do you feel
now turns out there was not even one
Patriot that there was not one
Patriot now here's the thing you should
know if you're watching any of the news
from the other
networks there were plenty of people
saying the case was easily
proven and you know plus the judges
instructions were kind of
nephew here is what I would
expect it should be the biggest
landslide in
history they've
overreached I didn't think it was real
until right now did
you I was having trouble imagining it
was real
but I'm pretty close to not paying my
taxes if you know what I mean I'm pretty
close to not paying my
taxes but here's what we should expect
you know there's going to be an appeal
process we assume it'll be overturned on
appeal because it's so dirty but whether
it does or not we could expect the D
campaign of Joe Biden to worsen their
situation in his statement tonight
because Biden's going to be all
convicted felon convicted felon do you
know what's the worst thing the B that
the uh the Biden campaign could
do the worst dumbest thing they could do
is to put all their focus on their dirty
trial and I think that's their plan I
think they want to put all their
attention on their rigged trial so there
was a rigged election I would say it's
confirmed at this point um anecdotally
and you know in terms of uh just
confirmed in terms of uh things we know
about you know the confirmed things that
are in the
news yeah so the glotus will be giving
his his uh speech
tonight
and I think you're going to
see an amount of energy that gets
Unleashed but it's going to be a very
quiet
energy it's going to be very quiet
energy and we're going to we're going to
put it into fourth
gear
so I think that I'm personally at risk
of going to jail at this
point because it looks like you know the
if they can get him they can get anybody
and that seems to be the message
so I'm going to act like I'm fighting
for my
life so I'm going to go pretty
dark because we're fighting a level of
evil like I've never seen
before this is actually the I think it's
the worst day in American history in my
life yeah I'd say so I would say this is
the darkest moment in American history
but I'll tell you one thing that's going
to happen for
sure something's going to
change oh something's going to change I
don't know
what and you could probably tell that
I'm doing everything I can to control my
reaction can you
tell can you tell that there's just a
little bit more anger than I'm showing
right now and that uh as time goes by
it's going to get worse
and if Biden does what I think he's
going to do and he does a
gloat from the White
House I think I might lose my
mind I might lose my
mind
and we're not at we're not at the point
where you know violence makes sense but
we're very close to it we're very close
to it now and I would have thought that
that wasn't really a possibility either
but I think actual violence is getting
close I don't recommend it so if if any
of you are thinking about trying it
don't do it because you'll it won't
work but I think violence is now on the
table because there'll be enough people
who believe this
is Way Beyond The Pale now it could be
that his supporters will be smart enough
to for the
appeal because at the moment he has a
commanding
Advantage if we don't
overreact if we don't overreact he's
going to win 40% of the black
vote because I don't care what you say
we all see what they're doing to him and
if that doesn't make you feel some
connection to him even more than you
know race ever
could I don't know I'd be surprised
I'm I'm terribly disappointed in the
country terribly disappointed and uh the
the last shred of respect I had for the
country was that the jury system works
so they've removed my last shred of
respect for my own country I have to say
I still love all the people you're all
awesome but I don't respect the system
anymore that that's the end of it for me
that that's my exit right there that's
the last time I will I I'm not not even
going to do a pledge of allegiance
anymore I'm done with that so I wouldn't
I'm not even going to stand for the
national anthem because the country is
gone there there's nothing to stand
for do you think I'm going to stand for
that flag
now seriously do you think I'm going to
stand for the American
flag after what I just watch
today nope nope I love the people and I
wish we could get our country back but
it's gone
folks it's gone the the last thing we
had protecting us was the jury system
and it's
gone thank you George
Soros
um I don't know what his security detail
looks like today but I hope he's staying
safe turn to Fox let's see what fox say
with both hands tied behind his back
this was a defendant for
whom because our country's gone to hell
we don't have the same country anymore
we have a divided mess we're nation in
Decline serious decline millions and
millions of people pouring into our
country right now from prisons and from
mental institutions terrorists and
they're taking over our country we have
a country that's in big trouble but this
was a rig decision right from day one
with a conflicted judge who should have
never been allowed to try this case
never and we will fight for our
constitution this is long from over
thank you very much
why are
you all right the former president uh
the former president speaking they're
briefly not taking any questions that's
been his practice as he's been speaking
here at the courthouse and remember he's
been under gag order for this trial as
well which has been uh it's been
stretched I think to its limits at
sometimes uh there have been findings by
the judge that there have been
violations um but the president the
former president has spoken openly from
the beginning saying that he felt this
judge had conflicts there have been
references to his daughter the work that
she does uh to Alvin Bragg and to the
way that this whole thing was set in
motion
um Trey you looked like you had some
reaction to what he was saying there
because of course this then flipped into
campaign mode because the line will be
okay the people get to answer their
verdict is the one that matters November
5th it's going to be a push to that now
as the talking point with this over my
guess is at some point president Trump
or his surrogates will say I perhaps I
am the convicted felon you are
unconvicted felons you have engaged in
egregious conduct it just hasn't
resulted in us using the court system to
go after you I think the Biden campaign
needs to be really really careful his
son may be a convicted felon by this
time next week the other thought I had
going to my mind is I was on a I was in
an audience sitting by Tim Scott in
South Carolina When Donald Trump went to
Great Lengths to defend New York
remember candidate Ted Cruz made uh an
unflattering reference to New York
values Andy you may recall that and
Donald Trump went to Great Links as a
candidate to defend New York and I just
think it is bitterly ironic that it
wound up being a district attorney from
New York who actually openly campaigned
on doing what he just did uh that is a
disturbance to the justice system
prosecutors shouldn't care about the
politics you don't go after people you
go after crime this new era of so-called
Progressive prosecutors there's nothing
Progressive about them they are defense
attorneys masquerading as prosecutors
and it's going to W up ultimately a hope
I think it all right where do we donate
must be a trump website for donating
somewhere your comments still
working all
right see if I can find a website for
donating I'll let you listen to this
while we're doing that maybe the undoing
of country well I hope that is not the
case uh that feels very ominous but I
know that people worry if they feel like
they can't have confidence in their
Judicial System um we know that when it
comes to Congress when it comes to many
of our institutions in Washington
polling shows us whether it's Pew or
Gallop there have been a lot of them in
recent months and years that have showed
people are Wonder they're worried about
the underpinnings of our our country and
they want to be able to trust them that
no matter what their position their
politics are that they're going to be
treated fairly once they get into the
court system now johu has a p I talked
to him earlier in the 3:00 hour he at
peace out today saying that this is
already no matter what the verdict was
going to be it's already damaged the
presidency and that folks on both sides
of the aisle now have to consider that
this is the way business gets done um
there are some who would say uh don't
encourage Republicans to now go try to
use the court system in the same way but
it seemed to me in in you know an
overview of John's piece that he seemed
to suggest well if this is the way the
game has played now both sides are going
to start playing it and as you know try
suggest maybe it's a new chapter in our
country and the way do things yeah I I I
think it's a new chapter I feel it
personally like as this trial unfolded
and we got more of a read on what Brad's
theory was that the judge was going to
allow him to let fly I started to think
about this in terms of what's going on
out there that this could be used as a
precedent to attack so for example this
very vague vaporous idea that
somehow politics what we've always known
as Politics as Usual which is filled
with Hyperbole and and often just flat
out untrue statements right now that's
being brought into the prosecutorial
realm into the courtroom so it occurred
to me for example if I wanted to have a
model like a a very loose uh conspiracy
against the United States which
occasionally gets invoked in federal
court uh where it's a deceptive scheme
to prevent the government from car out
an essential function like having an
honest election well what if I decided
that Joe Biden knows that when he says
that it was
n% all right that's $1,000 for the
president Trump
campaign I don't donate I don't donate
to political
campaigns but I'm donating to say
you to the
administration current
Administration so so I won't ask you to
do the same because Biden economy is so
bad
but well I think uh what the podcasters
should do is uh get their entire base to
donate while they're on the
air that's what I think
remember your donation
limits yeah $1,000 is
okay well thank you I appreciate
it it's the donation site
well here's the thing um let me tell you
something that one of my favorite
sayings by Mark
Dwayne is that we can't tell the
difference between good news and bad
news don't assume this is bad
news until you find out how much money
Trump raised today because I got a
feeling a lot of people are doing what I
just did which is before before the last
count is read They're reaching for their
credit card because it takes a lot for
me to give a $1,000 to a campaign
because I just generally assume it's a
waste of
money
so and I'm all
in I'm all
in whatever it takes at this point
fourth
gear it's summertime the summertime's
going to be lit now I would be worried
I would be worried if it didn't look
like it would help Trump but I think it
will and I also think that it it sort of
frees me up to say that they should all
be in
jail yeah I think what it's going to do
is increase his mandate that's what I
think all right wow
uh I'm not sure I want to hear all the
commentary for everybody because there
you go um that the donation page is
crashed the donation page just
crashed there we
go that's the
verdict
 you want you want to know
what the verdict
is the ver verdict is going to be the
billion dollars he raises today
because we're kind of
done and by the way where do you see his
next poll
numbers it's going to be
crazy yeah now now now something has to
be
done Elon is donating for every employee
is that really happening no no you can't
do that that's illegal you can't donate
for every
company can
you that that's not legal though right
to donate for your
employees yeah I don't think that's
happening Elon can
match you can match
this is thank you
JC yes you know how they always say this
isn't the hill to die on this is the
hill to die
on you are so right I'm going to use
that yeah yeah this is to the death now
I don't recommend violence but they're
going to have to kill me to make
me
stop they might yeah
and we won't get to the Supreme Court
before
election just uh just Google uh donate
Trump campaign it's the first thing that
comes
up but is there really news about
Elon is there some kind of news like
that where do you see what Silicon
Valley does like the Allin podcast ass
guys and PE people are going to go nuts
over
this yeah well we're not going to stand
for this th this is uh this is an action
point like I hope all it means is that
people watch the dropboxes and you know
vote and donate and talk but you're
definitely going to create
action there will be
action and uh I will not be happy until
until several hundred Democrats are in
jail
forever I don't know what that
is all right I've got to I've got to
take a call pretty soon so I'm
gonna dtz is on the war room right
now all right well I think I can
anticipate what everybody's going to say
for the next 20 hours it's it's all
going to be
Trump supporters saying it's a travesty
and
MSNBC saying yay it's the best thing
that ever
happened all right I get to run and I
will uh let's call this the uh the man
cave for tonight and
uh oh my
goodness that you really did we we
really did crash the donation site Is
that real that's real
right like honest to God we crashed the
donation site not we specifically but
that's real can you confirm that's real
that the donation site just
crashed cave 2 I don't know I don't know

2 I'll be damned good keep
trying all right everybody let's go
watch our news we'll talk about this
more

had to wait a few
seconds so it doesn't feel like I just
left I'm just sort of stalling right now
so that it doesn't feel rude but
probably I've stalled too
long now I'll push the button
