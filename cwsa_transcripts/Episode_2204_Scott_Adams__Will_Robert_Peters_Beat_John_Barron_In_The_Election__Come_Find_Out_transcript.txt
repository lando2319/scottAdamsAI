good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
possibly some alien civilizations maybe
Ai and some simulated realities but for
now let's just stick to the stuff we
know and if you'd like to take this up
to levels that you've never even
imagined would be possible all you'd use
a cup of mug or a glass attacker
chalices tie the canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled little pleasure the
dopamine in the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
oh that's good yeah that's good
oh yeah
well there's so much news I barely know
where to begin
it's all amusing and interesting and
well I don't know this could be the best
time you've ever had your life it's
about to happen now
let me start with a video I saw from
Joshua Steinman uh he was he was
wondering why in this video they showed
a dad making a sound to calm his crying
baby
and I'll try to reproduce the sound but
basically the baby's crying next to him
he just looks at the baby and he goes oh
basically you know maybe I didn't get
the tone exactly
and the baby just goes uh it just
completely stops crying and goes into a
whole other mode
and Joshua asked what's going on here
like why does that work you know what
what is the magic of the the sound
and
as your friendly neighborhood hypnotist
I thought I would take a shot at
answering that question because it's
more interesting than you think
I think that when the father goes oh and
the baby stops crying
it's as simple as
it moves the baby's thinking to another
part of the baby's brain
when it comes to brains and psychology
think of it like real estate
location location location
if somebody's using a part of their
brain and there's something about that
that's not working either for you
or for them
you want to get them away from that part
of the brain you just move them to a
different part so the baby presumably
was in there's something I need mode
need some food need some something I
need something but probably wasn't in
any kind of great distress it's just the
babies can't talk so when there's any
any little thing they need they cry
so it's not too hard to give somebody
distracted
from a thing that's
you know not that big a deal and maybe a
little bit hungry
so the the humming is so uh unusual for
the environment because the babies heard
talking they've heard General noise but
they don't know what this is you know
they'd probably have the same reaction
if say uh an alarm went off they'd stop
and oh what's this new thing so probably
the only thing that's happening is that
the brain the baby replaced
I would say the need for food perhaps it
replaced that with curiosity
now here's the lesson and by the way my
new book reframe your brain is along
this these lines is how to reprogram
your own brain fairly quickly and that's
what's happening with the baby the
baby's brain is being reprogrammed in
real time simply moving the program from
one part of the brain to another
and curiosity is an insanely underrated
human impulse
we're we're designed or were evolved to
be curious and that curiosity is what
keeps us alive right if you hear it if
you hear a mysterious sound behind you
you're going to turn around because it
might be danger so curiosity is
literally baked into your survival
so if you want somebody to get away from
Hunger
let's say the baby crying then curiosity
uh oh there might be something here that
I really need to know about right away
that's the way to do it so if you can if
you want to distract somebody
use curiosity
it's the same if you're in the let's say
you're in a car with your kids this is a
trick I used on step kids and the kids
are a certain age and they're in the
back and they're just arguing and they
get in that mode where they can't get
out of it they're just fighting verbally
this works almost every time look a deer
even though everybody's seen the deer
it evokes that there's something
different curiosity thing and kids will
stop immediately where
and it's not even that interesting it
just it just goes to their curiosity
part of the brain and then they're done
so that is the same kind of effect that
at least in one way it's the same kind
of effect
as a reframe
a reframe takes you from where your
thoughts are physically in the real
state in your brain
it just moves it to another part
sometimes that's all you need
you just got to move away from where you
are and move to another part so reframes
do that instantly and that's one of the
reasons they work it's not the only
reason but it's a key part we'll talk
about that more my book reframe your
brain just launched yesterday but only
on Kindle only on Kindle and we hope
today maybe tomorrow we should get
approval from Amazon to start selling
the hard copy so the hard copy maybe of
the day we'll see I'll let you know as
soon as I know
all right
Trump said he's not going to have that
election fraud event he was going to
have where he was going to talk about
all the election fraud he's seen I guess
so instead they're going to wrap that
into some kind of legal filing
does it sound like he had the goods
not really
I think if he had the goods he would go
along with it so I remind you that 95 of
all election claims are
false
don't know if there are any real ones I
don't know
oh damn it I just got demonetized
I don't know that for sure but those are
the key words that got me demonetized
the last several times
you can't say anything about it so I
think when I talk about it again later
I'll use key code words I think you'll
know what I'm talking about
but when we get to that point I'm just
going to use code words
all right
um apparently there's a technology that
can make plastic or it could replace
plastic using plant and woods you know
plant-based stuff and wood now
apparently this is already in use it's
just more expensive than the
old-fashioned way to make plastic
so the the big you know the big change
would be if they could make it more
efficient and I guess they're working
towards that and it's starting to grow
this plant-based and wood-based
uh plastic now if this becomes a big
thing let's say all of our plastic
started to get replaced
with plant-based entry based plastic
logically you would want to increase
your uh your supply of plants
and trees
so if this were me I would be looking to
add something I was some kind of a
fertilizer like
thing to the planet if you could is
there any way to do that is there any
way to add something to let's say the
atmosphere so it gets everywhere that
would promote the growth of these plants
because we're going to need a lot of
them to turn them into plastic
I can't think of anything if you think
of anything let me know CO2
CO2 well now you're thinking
this brainstorming session is going well
so far
CO2 I'll take that under consideration
well New Zealand uh I think this was in
the Peter zayan tweet has figured out
how to lower the cost of housing
do you want to know what amazing amazing
idea they had to do it
they reduced their building zoning
restrictions
that's all it took
that's it I think the biggest change was
they allowed multi-unit homes on what
had been single family homes
so imagine if you were a single family
home owner
and you wanted to turn it into let's say
a Triplex so three families could live
there you had plenty of room
you just couldn't do it
it was just illegal
so New Zealand just said
about we make that legal and guess what
happened free market a bunch of people
bought a bunch of people and companies
built multi-unit homes
they were all built to code you know it
wasn't like they were unsafe it's just
they weren't allowed before
so now they have plenty of homes and so
the cost of housing went down
I wonder if there's some I wonder if
something like that could work in the
United States well the problem with the
United States is that we're we got all
these states
all 50 of them and they all have their
own regulations so unless we had some
kind of a Federal Regulation that could
override local ones that would be a
problem in our system
but yeah the the Adu Market the the
little uh homes that you can ship in on
a truck and just plop in your backyard
I don't know if you follow the news on
that but they're exploding
if you're on Instagram and you've ever
clicked on one of those ads you get all
these other companies that are popping
up building these
um usually like a 400 square foot home
that they just deliver and plop down on
your land
so all that stuff is possible I think
housing can be fixed we just have to
tweak the zoning
all right I saw a interesting back and
forth on the livability of San Francisco
Paul Graham who
spent a lot of time in San Francisco
he said San Francisco you wouldn't
recommend it for raising children
but he thought that a young person who
was careful
you know it might be okay
is that the worst recommendation you've
ever heard for a city
what do you think of San Francisco the
jewel of California well
I wouldn't bring children there
and unless you're under 25 and you can
run pretty fast it's kind of a Bad Bet
so there's your San Francisco
you know what's interesting also is that
San Francisco is now teaming with
self-driving taxis I think that happened
kind of overnight it seems
is there anybody from San Francisco
watching
can you confirm that there are
self-driving taxis that are in operation
and that they're somewhat almost
ubiquitous
is that really happening
because I haven't seen videos or first
person reports but I see news reports
about it
yeah okay so we have one confirmation
from Iceland
good enough
um
so that's interesting now what's
interesting about that is uh years ago I
wrote a book that you can't buy because
I'm banned for most of my other books
um it's called the religion War it was a
sequel to my book and God's debris and
in the religion War it was said in a
time in the future because I wrote this
20 years ago it was that in the time in
the future where small drones were
attacking cities
that's happening now in Moscow
right small drones attacking cities and
uh that the the the main mode of
transportation was self-driving taxes
that you could call with your app
this is 20 years ago and the other part
was that there if you use your massive
databases of computing that knows what
everybody's doing in the world
sort of like we have now
that you could identify what I called in
the fictional story The Prime influencer
the prime influencer the idea was that
you know how ideas just sort of catch on
there'll be something that is in the
back of your mind for a while or maybe
you never heard of and then all of a
sudden
everybody's into it and it seems like
maybe you've been around forever but why
does everybody care about it right now
and the fictional idea was you could
trace back the lines of influence if you
could find out who did what social media
who knows who you know who has influence
over who that you could find the lines
of influence
and that you could identify the one
person now in in the fiction model there
was one person in the real world it
would be multiple people who had
influence over their domains
and I wondered could you identify
somebody in today's world
that had such an influence over politics
let's say in the last you know eight to
ten years
that no it's not me
it's not me can you can you think of one
individual who changed
the actual canvas I mean things look
really different
Mike certovic
and the fun part about it is there's a
lot of people in the world who have
never even heard his name
now I'm not gonna I mean I'm not even
gonna press the argument
because if you know you know
and if you want to know you can figure
it out you can talk to people you can do
a lot of research someday somebody might
write the book
like if you saw it in a book
you know what things he influenced and
then and how that spread out now I count
myself as one of the people who you're
listening to primarily because of him
yeah in my earliest you know forays of
talking about politics he boosted me but
if he didn't notice he's boosted a
number of other people
so he got there on his own with you know
Guerrilla mindset his book and being one
of the best tweeters of all time right
and having the the full full set of
communication and persuasion tools which
is unusual to have a full set
and
he did more than just make his own brand
well known
but he seeded a lot of other people
including me so that when our fluent our
influence grew
it was sort of a shadow of things that
were least compatible with a lot of
things that that he would influence so
I think someday we'll actually be able
to measure this and you'll be able to
find out who is the most influential and
there's no way to track that now you
would actually have to really be
immersed
in this sort of social media political
world even
even know who is influential
because there are a lot of people you
see on TV who are the you know the
talking heads with nice suits who just
say what everybody else says they don't
have any persuasive power whatsoever
nobody's tried to copy them
right nobody's looking at Jake Tapper
and saying I I like that suit me where
he wears really nice suits but nobody's
looking at him saying I'd like to be
that haircut
you know whatever he's doing I'd like to
do more of that
like that's just not something that the
normal media inspires
so you have to look to other people for
that
all right here's my opinion on the
cities
um I think that cities are not just
places where there are too many attics
they're also that but I think the cities
are addicts themselves
and they're addicted to destructive
empathy
the empathy that feels good like oh I
I'm I told you that I'm a sanctuary City
I told you that my police don't arrest
people I told you that we're not bad to
the street people
so there's some kind of I think it's
probably uh dopamine
there must be some dopamine hit that you
get from acting Superior morally
Superior having more empathy than other
people
but that's largely you could call it
liberals
but that feels insulting to me I I'm not
going to say the cities are being
destroyed by liberals
because I'm pretty sure there are plenty
of liberals who don't like anything
that's happening in the cities right so
it's not liberals per se there's some
kind of addiction
it feels like and when you see that
reason has been dispensed with
what does that tell you because these
are not all stupid people
there's an addiction
and I would I would think that you know
without getting who getting into is a
progressive who's liberal without even
getting into the politics
the I think the politics probably
follows the emotion not the other way
and I think that there's an addiction to
being nice or empathetic that they can't
shake
because the way you would fix any of
this stuff is being meaner to people am
I right
the the solution to the cities is to
treat the people who are in the worst
situation already
to treat them in a mean or severe way
because that's the only thing that
changes Behavior basically
so here's my prediction cities like
addicts have to hit bottom
cities have to bottom
they can't come back until they bought
them because it won't be the will to do
anything
as long as it's sort of working
and you're sort of still you know the
traffic lights are sort of working and
you know it's still sometimes the police
show up maybe late but sometimes they do
yes if his logs is still sort of working
nobody's going to change anything
because they're addicts they're addicted
to the feeling of being kind to people
but at some point they will hit bottom
and there'll be you know some City will
just become unlivable completely
and then things will change but not
until not until then so wait for the
cities to bottom and I don't think we're
quite that close to it might be within
three years total Destruction of City
living and that will be not the bad news
that will be the good news
right if you're not aware of this when
an alcoholic hits bottom
and they survive which is dicey
that's the only the only way they can
ever get better
the same thing about them so it's not
bad news it's necessary news
all right uh Brazil is testing some kind
of a cocaine vaccination you get the
vaccination and the cocaine doesn't feel
so good I don't have great hopes for
that
but it does suggest that if big Pharma
got involved Anything Could Happen
meaning that they could force they could
make a mandatory I suppose you know if
they if they had enough power over the
government so I'm not in favor of uh
vaccinations for cocaine users I think
they would just switch to other drugs
and they you just have to keep upgrading
the vaccination then you'll have a
fentanyl vaccination which I think
they're working on actually then you'll
need a heroin vaccination and then
you're going to need a marijuana
vaccination and then of course an
alcohol vaccination do you think the
vaccination industry is going to stop
with the one drug
if they get that through
everybody's going to be spitting up new
vaccinations for everything you don't
think there's going to be a vaccination
for sugar
of course oh you said it before me
dammit
dammit the cat the comments beat me yeah
there will be a vaccination for sugar
for cigarettes tobacco yeah of course of
course
I'm not sure I feel good about that but
it's something that's out there
um there was a very important science
thing
that happened and um Let me let me read
you the science thing
all right it's from University of Kansas
Department of physics
and I did a study that uh now listen to
this carefully because I don't I don't
want you to be confused by this it's
very simple
the study rigorously proved that the
thermal fluctuations of freestanding
graphene when connected to a circuit
with diodes having non-linear resistance
obviously linear resistance would be
stupid but the diet if the diodes have
non-linear resistance and the storage
capacitors
it produces useful work by charging the
storage capacitors
so
you got that working for you I don't
know what any of this means but it seems
to mean it almost sounds like it could
produce
energy and of nothing
when I say nothing it's not actually
nothing but energy out of just sitting
there
am I right is that what it say
that if this works you can create energy
just by sitting around
the wooden Nissan or cold or warm or
Steam
photons or is it photons
all right
Snoopy boob says LOL Scott very basic
Electronics read a book
solid advice
read a book
thank you
book
um
all right
so there's that have have any of you
seen the uh you all know the story of
the the musical sensation is that uh
Anthony Oliver
he's got the big red beard and red hair
and he pleases banjo thing it is song I
forget the name of the song but it's the
one with your wages
Etc what's the name of the song uh the
or the rich man north of Richmond
which is also by the way an amazing
title for a song the rich Bend north of
Richmond
try try not remembering that
yeah I I forgot it for a moment but it
came right back the rich men north of
Richmond man that's good
that's good you I don't think he gets
enough credit for his writing
this uh Anthony Oliver
because the singing the performance is
amazing he's very talented but the
writing the writing ooh
the writing is kind of special
it'd be interesting to see if this is
something he can generalize to his other
his other art I hope so it's pretty
amazing but anyway if you want to feel
good about America and I know you need
this
huh and maybe a new place else as well
watch the uh the videos you can Google
it just look for reaction videos
of Anthony Oliver reaction videos no
reaction video is where a YouTuber
usually plays a video often music and
then you just see a little inset of the
person reacting to it now usually
usually it's the common ones would be a
young black kid a YouTuber listening to
Led Zeppelin for the first time
and then you know being amazed because
it just as they hadn't been exposed
so anyway here's what's special about
this the somebody put together a
compilation of all the different
reaction videos and overlaid it on the
one performance so you can see all of
the reactions not just one person
and what was special about it is that
they did a really good job of making
sure you had a mix of people so you had
maybe half of them were African-American
you had some Asian people watching Asian
Americans you had some you know standard
white people watching and here's here's
the thing that touches you they all had
the same reaction
they were all brought to tears
and when you watch the the you know the
white the Asian American probably there
was a Hispanic American in there
somewhere and the black Americans who
you would imagine would be on the on a
different side of literally everything
you know if you if you watch the news
you assume that you watch them agreeing
to tears
agreeing to the point of Tears
about the message in the song not that
the the song was just beautiful because
it is but the message
they agreed to tears
that's the country you live in
if you get the government out of the way
you get the media out of the way that
was an unfiltered experience nobody in
the news told you how to feel about that
I mean the news kind of promoted it as a
thing that exists but they didn't tell
you how to feel about it
nobody told you how to feel about it
that you just felt it and then and you
could see in this
that maybe
Maybe
this will be the moment when people
realize
that the most important reframe
in American history
is available but not yet taken it's
available because we all know it
you know what I'm talking about
it has never been
black against White
or at least not in modern times
no it's always been Rich against poor
that's what the song gets to it gets to
that and everybody recognizes it upon
exposure that's it
if you just say it you know again if
you're just a person on TV with a suit
and you say let me tell you Jake Tapper
the real story here is that we should be
talking about the rich versus the poor
no impact no impact it's just a talking
person saying some words
then you watch Anthony
um Anthony Oliver
choose words that are just better chosen
more emotional more persuasive than
anything I've ever seen on the same
topic
and he just cut through everything
he just got through all the noise
it was sort of a perfect moment so if
you're feeling bad about your country
and you've got raisins you've got
raisins there is this one crack in the
narrative
that one bearded guy with uh what is
that some kind of
electric banjo or something one bearded
guy with a banjo just sliced through the
narrative like it wasn't even there
that's inspiring
that's inspiring
all right
um
China's got a youth unemployment 21
yikes
uh so China's got problems here are some
things that are problems for China
so Biden Administration is ramping up
the
technology
uh controls or what would you call it
the things that are banned so that China
can't get them
um and apparently
you at the moment
China seems like they're solid but
apparently all signals are that the
wheels are coming off all right the
unemployment is higher they've got a
population bomb they've got they've got
a lot of they've printed a lot of money
I didn't know that but they printed more
money than the US has
percentage-wise and
um there they don't have access to Mid
or high-end semi-cut semiconductors and
there's no plan when that could happen
what would happen to China if they're
actually cut off from semiconductors
beyond the the lowest level of them
they're actually their civilization
would grind to a halt and that's
actually what it looks like right now
if we put restrictions on China getting
semiconductors
what does that do to the risk of war
with Taiwan
does it make it more or less
I feel like they almost have to capture
Taiwan to give some my conductors
am I wrong
so you know there are lots of other
forces so I don't I don't think
oh
let me tell you something that the news
didn't report on
so this will be I think this will be the
first time you've heard this
uh Vivek
uh eliminated the possibility of China
going to war over Taiwan
now when I say eliminated I don't mean
forever not forever
forever is still alive right
but let me tell you how
Vivek gave an interview
in which he said that since we rely on
the summit conductors there is no way
that China is going to get Taiwan as
long as we rely on their semiconductors
but we're working hard to make this
stuff domestically and Vivek says
directly once we can make this stuff
domestically
Taiwan becomes a Civil War and not our
problem
do you see it yet
do you see it he stopped he stopped any
chance of war with Taiwan
because what he said was if you're
patient you can have it
that's now you didn't say that that this
is me putting my own words on it but the
way China is going to hear it is wait
wait did I hear that right a major
candidate for president who may in fact
become president because we're over in
China and we see that the only guy who
could stop him seems to be indicted four
times he's running against a cadaver
and DeSantis is falling oh we
better listen to what he says because
you know they're listening to the major
candidates right
so imagine you're China
you have a strategic goal that's it you
don't care if it takes a hundred years
or a thousand years you're
getting Taiwan back and you know what
that's what I'd do if I were them
if I were China
I'd be saying I am getting we are
getting Taiwan back
there's no way that the U.S is going to
have this like major Ally sitting in our
Harbor
forever right we we get there we can't
do it right away but we're getting it
back if you tell China who has you know
the Thousand-Year plan
that maybe if you wait you know eight
years or something like that
that it'll be much easier for you to do
it in fact you won't even get much
resistance from us
now if you were them would you go soon
if you can just wait
you wouldn't no the China is a rational
actor with a really long uh timeline in
patience
Vivek told somebody with a with good
strategic thinking and a long timeline
that if you do it in the next eight
years you're crazy that's crazy
because we're going to stop you and it's
trouble and if you think it's not
nuclear better think again because this
because those microchips are a basis for
our civilization we're not going to not
have them period
no war
the odds of war with Taiwan dropped to
zero as soon as he said that
am I wrong
and am I the first person who told you
this
now let me say again
that we're seeing candidates
accomplish things in the real world like
I've never seen before
he said exactly the right thing
to stop a war
I mean a lot of you thought oh it's
pretty inevitable it's going to happen
next year there's no way it's going to
happen next year there's no way China is
going to go
when somebody at that level gave a real
good argument why waiting eight years is
really smart
really smart
now that's a real world effect
while he's a candidate
who else is doing that RFK Jr
in my opinion
RFK Jr is you know surfacing things
about vaccinations and our food and
chronic illnesses and the border the
Border
I mean RFK Jr has done more
for our understanding and therefore I
think an ultimate solution to the Border
than Trump
than Trump
RFK Jr has done more to close the border
we're not there but he's done more to
set the stage than Trump
Trump did a lot of talking
RFK went down there and he dug in and
created a movie about it and now he's
now he's telling you exactly what the
problem is that's way more productive
right so just hold this in mind
the amazingness that's happening right
now the candidates are so strong
that they're changing the world as
candidates as candidates have you ever
seen this now let's talk about another
one Larry Elder was on the uh The
Breakfast Club
um yesterday or the day before so the
clips are going around what is Larry
Elder running for president for is it
because he thinks he has a pretty good
chance to win it
well maybe they all think that under the
right circumstances but Larry Elder has
this message that he's had for a long
time that the problem with black America
is families and maybe maybe with America
in general is families but a little more
acute in the black community and he's
basically hammering that message so he
took that to The Breakfast Club and and
made his point
is Larry Elder
producing benefits as a candidate
or does he have to wait till he's
president which is a long shot now he's
producing the fact that he went on The
Breakfast Club where they had a
different view of you know what's going
on
was so productive I I tweeted it and you
should absolutely watch it like if you
want to kind of understand the the
landscape of the two different opinions
a great place to see it because The
Breakfast Club Now give me a fact check
on this
but one of the things that impresses me
about them is that they do seem
intellectually very flexible
and very well informed am I wrong
that they're intellectually flexible and
very well informed
so they're really quite a National Asset
at this point now you don't don't
confuse that with agreeing with them
you're not supposed to agree with them
it doesn't work that way but do they do
they show intellectual flexibility do
they bring in important topics
and do they you know bring you maybe to
another better understanding because
you've seen yeah I think they do it's
long form and they let people you know
talk it out
it's very good
so there you go RFK Junior Vivek and
Larry Elder
killing it
as candidates it's very impressive
all right uh you know you want me to
talk about the fact that Biden
apparently has a secret name Robert L
Peters and uh there are a bunch of
references to it on the the laptop and
of course uh
you might remember if you if you saw the
saw the video of Tucker talking about it
that his family called him called
somebody pedo Pete
so some people are
saying that Robert Peters and pet opete
might be the same thing and it has
something to do with but I I'm not
comfortable with any of those
accusations
I'm just telling you they're rolling
around all right
and I guess representative Comer has
asked for all the unredacted documents
they have uh that fake name in it Robert
Peters now
don't you think this is going to get you
one step closer
uh one step closer to unraveling the
Biden crime family situation
now
um
do you know what this means though
there's a very good chance that our uh
our next election will be a contest
between Robert Peters and John Barron
so Robert Peters might be running
against John Barron for president
as you remember Trump was allegedly John
Barron he would call people and say it
was somebody else
ask you this
uh there are quite a few candidates who
are running for president
if you were to look at all the other
candidates and by that I mean the ones
that the experts think will not be in
the final race
because the experts are still saying
it's Biden versus Trump right based on
the polls
anybody of all the other candidates
also have a second name that they use
I'm thinking it's zero
do you think Chris Christie it was
actually you know George McGee maybe I
don't know maybe maybe they all or or or
the other way maybe they all have secret
names do any of you have a secret name
all right
well speaking of secret names
um I have a I have a hypothesis that a
candidate's name has more to do with
their success than is obvious
now in the and the hypothesis goes like
this the more fun it is to say their
name or the more interesting the name
the more Advantage they have now it's
not predictive like they'll definitely
win because they have a good name but
Barack Obama was hard not to say
is almost like uh playing the drums by
Barack Obama I mean it's almost got a
percussion to it it's just like a great
thing to say
um how about AOC
right the fact that she needed the three
letters
because her name was sort of long and
interesting
all right uh Trump himself
Trump himself Trump is a fun name to say
right
here's another name that's fun to say
Vivek ramaswamy
but it's got one problem
that is hard for you know your standard
American to remember the name and then
pronounce it correctly
fake but it's fun to say once you get it
you know once you're like one one of the
smart people who knows how to pronounce
it you can act like you're smart in
front of your friends well have you
heard of Vivek ramaswamy you know if you
could if you could pronounce it right
you sound like you're the smart one in
the room because the other people it
could be what's what's that
Swami you know they're all going to be
doing that you're like
I think you mean for the fake ramaswamy
so great
um so you want to be that person but I
only noticed today
the Vivek ramaswamy has interesting
initials
VR
come on
come on
you tell me that if he let's say he gets
to you know a higher level you know he's
knocking on the door right now but let's
say he gets really into the main
conversation which I think he's going to
do by the way
um
that people are going to call them VR
you tell me that's not fun to say VR
oh it is oh it is it's V for victory
yeah and I don't know the this names
that are fun to say thing is pretty
powerful
all right uh I would also say have you
noticed that uh Vivek has been on
Tucker's show
Jordan Peterson's show
um and uh where else was he
he was on well everywhere basically John
Stossel
and all of them seem to have a positive
opinion of it all right and then Elon
Musk tweeted once or twice yesterday
that vague is an interesting candidate
with potential
so
just hold this in your mind people who
are impressed with him and believe he
has the at least has the capabilities of
being an impressive president
Tucker Jordan Peterson Elon Musk John
Stossel
and me because I endorse the vague for
president
now are you noticing a pattern
you see any pattern
did you notice that uh
cernovich has sort of moved away from
DeSantis
do you see what's happening
yeah
it's uh internet dad time
internet dad time the internet dads
are tapping you on the shoulder
it is very subtle so far
it's just that you're going to start
noticing
that it's the smart people I hate to say
it but that's just true it's the smart
people
the smart people are noticing
watch watch for the people that I call
the internet dads and again they're not
women they're not all men they can be
women they could be lgbtq whatever it's
just the dad Vibe you know that the
person who's just trying to help
not not trying to be overly political
just trying to help uh and knows how
that's the dad Vibe just just trying to
help and also knows how
so they do it
yeah I don't know I'll keep an eye on
that that's that's a whole lot of uh
talking about and interest in chattering
from exactly the right people and I want
to I want to put this in your mind put
this image in your mind
imagine a world and at the moment it's
unlikely based on current polling but
imagine a world in which Vivek ends up
in the final contest and he's debating
on stage either one
Biden
or Kamal Harris
just put it in your head make sure
you've watched at least one Vivek a
long-form interview
so that you can see what kind of skill
he brings which we've never seen by the
way you know as good as Trump is Trump's
sort of a a bully debater
but nobody does bully debating you know
energy debating better than he does he's
just the best at the energy you know
control Alpha dominant kind of thing but
Vivek we've never seen we've never seen
this
he he has a control of the topics and a
facility with words
we've never seen this and it would be
interesting to see how far this could go
um
but I think you're going to see it
he's Rising
um I think that if you saw an interview
or if you saw a debate if you imagine it
happened between Vivek and Joe Biden
here's my prediction
MSNBC would have to fake a power outage
that's a real prediction
in the unlikely event the Vivek and Joe
Biden end up in a one-on-one debate
I predict the MSNBC will have a
technical problem
that they lose they care that they just
go off the air
or or there will be no debate that's a
possibility too but there's no way
there's no way they're going to put
Biden up there with Vivek they can put
Biden up there with Trump
would destroy him
but they might think they have a shot
with that you know maybe it would be
wrong but they might think so they don't
have any shot with a vague they have
none that that would be a Slaughter
so I heard some people say that Trump
and Vivek might not get along
because you know they're they're both
strong-willed people
here's my take which I feel very
confident about but of course I couldn't
know for sure but I'm very confident
about this this is my read on Trump
he doesn't suffer fools
but if you're smarter than he is
he he's all he's all about it
and as smart as Trump is in his way I
mean there's nobody like him
Vivek is smarter than him and he knows
it Trump trump would know I know it did
you know how hard it is for me to say
somebody's smarter than me
come on that's pretty hard for me to say
but in this case it's kind of easy
because he's actually just smarter than
me he's smarter than you too
so get over it
but Trump does not have an ego problem
per se
about people who have so much skill that
if you were to work with them the two of
them would be stronger than either of
them together
so I think you're you're very
misinterpreting Trump's personality if
you think he would run away from or have
a problem with a person at the highest
capability
he has a problem with the um General
Millie types you know General milley
when I watched General milley on TV I
think to myself is it just me or does he
seem not smart
he just he just seemed not smart I mean
I hate to say it he was smart enough to
become a general so that's pretty good
but not really Trump smart
right he wasn't Trump smart he wasn't
even Pet Smart
and he's definitely not for fake smart
you can tell
so I think that Trump and somebody with
that level of capability especially
someone who's been supportive of trump
you know in a general sense in a legal
sense yeah I I think it's closer to they
would get along amazingly
but if you say would there be rumors of
them having big fights over topics of
course
yeah if they work together in any way in
the future they would have big fights
over topics
and then they would get over it and then
they'd just get out of a life yeah of
course
um Newt Gingrich says he heard so this
is hearsay which he calls it hearsay
meaning that he heard it from somebody
you heard it from somebody basically
that uh that funny Willis prosecutor got
a call
to say that Trump had to be indicted on
Monday to cover up the bad news story
about Weiss's screw-up
now
do you think that happened
do you think somebody in the Democrat
power structure said no you've got to go
in this today and she she pushed back
because she wasn't ready and they said
no ask me today because of the news
coverage
I'm going to give that a
probably
only because it sounds so normal
right it doesn't sound extraordinary
enough where I'd say that's too on the
nose because it looks to be sort of like
normal business
and I don't even think that this is
illegal is it would it be illegal to say
you know you could get two benefits if
you do it today if you wait you only get
one benefit but you were going to do it
anyway
is that illegal
I mean doesn't the defendant have a
right to a speedy trial so if the
pressure was to make it more speedy it's
going to be hard to say that was illegal
it would be coordinated yeah
now
uh the proud boys leader uh Enrique
tario who was not even at the January
6th thing is uh they're they're trying
to put him in jail for 33 years
so that's what they're shooting for
33 years in prison do you see that to be
something about Enrique Ontario or the
proud boys is that what that story is
about
no it's not it's about you
it's about scaring you and making sure
that Trump looks as bad as possible
to me it looks like uh this person is
going to be sacrificed
sacrificed in the sense
that if they can if they can give this
one guy who would be notable in the
story
because everybody's heard of The Proud
boys the leader of the proud boys is a
big part of the story
if they can give this guy 33 years or
even
working toward giving him 33 years it's
going to make whatever Trump is accused
of look more serious right to me that's
probably the only reason it's happening
I mean I could imagine they wouldn't
even charge him you know if Trump were
not part of the story
so I don't know the details it could be
that there's something more to it but if
he wasn't there
and all he was trying to do is uh delay
the count so they could make sure that
they had audited it
ah 33 years for that
that's a lot like 33 years for free
speech
I mean it's close to it so I'm not
comfortable with it don't like it
all right um
yeah
you know there was a time
not too long ago let's say 10 years ago
if I saw a story about a guy who was
maybe going to get 33 years in prison
and it was a big you know public story
and they've been investigating here for
a long time I would assume that the
prosecutors have the goods
that in all likelihood you know
innocence will prove and guilty but ten
years ago I would have said well almost
certainly guilty I mean really they've
looked into it already
but in 2023 I don't think that at all
in 2023 I think it's unlikely they have
the goods
I think it's just political
what do you think does it look like uh
justice or just politics do you to me it
looks like dirty politics and nothing
else
now that doesn't mean I'm right I'm
talking about assumptions
my assumption 10 years ago probably
guilty if they if they're making a big
deal about it it's their job to find out
who's guilty why wouldn't he be
2023 probably not probably not true
so that's just the assumptions all right
in my effort to not be demonetized
I'm going to talk about a topic using
code
are you ready you have to pay attention
a little extra
all right so I'm going to talk about an
event that happened one year after 2019.
and one month before February 6.
you remember that right
and uh it was after an election between
these two fellows uh Robert Peters and
John Barron
so they had an election back in 2019
plus one and uh and then some protests
happened uh one month before February 6.
and uh there's some news about this
there's a Media Group
um whose initials
are really the same initials as oh my
God
oh my God yeah there's a Media Group
that does Undercover videos same
initials as oh my God
and they've got this undercover video
that suggest uh
that there was some kind of impropriety
with uh seven thousand pieces of paper
these seven thousand pieces of paper
they had an official use they were they
were used for something uh regarding
that event between Robert Peters and
John Barron there were pieces of paper
that would be put into machines you
don't need to know why them they're just
pieces of paper going into machines but
there was a report that there's this one
person who can't be found now oh
surprise can't be found now
who allegedly admitted to
putting seven thousand of these pieces
of papers into a box on the street that
had something to do with an event
between Robert Peters and John Barron
and
according to this group that has a name
that has the same initials as oh my God
uh this is all pretty well documented
and
the problem here is this this feels too
much like UFOs
have you noticed that the UFOs or we
always have the unclear photographs and
the person who talked to the person
and you can never get beyond that
barrier of blurry photographs and people
who talk to other people
and with this one we don't have the
person who was alleged to do it
and I have not heard from the police
officer I'm hearing from people who talk
to people
Maybe
so if you said to me Scott
is the quality of this Evolution
evidence sufficient to convince you that
there was serious impropriety in the
year 2019 plus one between that
competition between Robert Peters and
John Barrett and I would have said to
you honestly I haven't seen it
uh two thousand mules was debunked
um in the sense that there was no video
support and you imagined there would
have been
so that not debunked in terms of
falsified but debunked in terms of the
obvious thing you would look for to
confirm it wasn't there video somewhere
at least one video or one witness or one
confession or something like that
so we didn't have that but
so I'm of two minds and it goes like
this
number one mind
I need some evidence
now I know there's evidence but you need
you know a court or some follow-up to
find out that the evidence means
something not just evidence evidence is
kind of meaningless until you've
confirmed it
um
so on one hand the rational part of me
says you know I don't see the evidence
and people have been looking pretty hard
I've seen claims but they're all kind of
UFO quality claims
so under normal circumstances if that
were the only decision I were making I'd
say you know I'm going to bet against
finding any problems there
finding that's different different
discussion than
there are or not problems just finding
but have you noticed or have I mentioned
or have you been here when I mentioned
and Tucker Carlson has said it a lot as
well that the Democrats always blame you
for what they do
and every time it happened I would say
just a coincidence you're just you're
just shaping the evidence to fit your
narrative it's like okay confirmation
bias it's not it's they're not just
literally blaming you of what they're
doing that would be stupid
and then you see one evidence after
another now even if you don't believe
that they're intentionally blaming you
for what they're doing
how do you ignore the pattern
I mean the pattern is very well
established
they do seem to be blaming the
Republicans of the things they are later
confirmed to have done themselves
now
fast forward to the present
a guy named John Barron
is being indicted on Ricoh charges
meaning that he didn't just try to do
something they say but rather it was
part of an Enterprise of people
conspiring to do something
foreign
so they always accuse you of what
they're doing
and they just accused this poor John
Baron fellow whoever he is
of a Rico
kind of situation
I'm going to have to go with the obvious
the obvious the obvious future is that
there's a RICO problem here on the
democrat's side and that they conspire
to make the events of 2019 plus one come
out the way they wanted
so I don't see the evidence but I think
it's largely guaranteed
so am I allowed to say in public I have
zero evidence
but given the larger situation and that
includes the fact that in all of human
history there's never been a complicated
high-stakes system that is not fully
transparent and there are lots of people
involved who have high interest in in
distorting the results that has never
existed in human civilization without
becoming corrupt over time
never there's not any example of it ever
the church yeah you could try pretty
hard to give you be a counter example
how about the about the finance
um world all totally straight right no
no whenever you've got something
complicated high value and lots of
people it's always corrupt how about the
crypto world
all good right no
it's just full of scams
but we have been told by some
entity that you could imagine is
coordinated in a RICO kind of a way
we're told that all 50 states were the
only exceptions to the thing that is an
unbroken Trend in human civilization
that wherever there can be fraud there
is
wherever there can be and this is the
very situation where they it most can be
now when you say to me Scott Scott they
ordered this really show me the audit
where they found out the woman
allegedly who threw away I'm just making
this up this is not an actual claim uh
show me show me how you audited the
person who collected a bunch of ballots
from some place they thought would go
one way and then just threw them away
instead of delivering them to the
Dropbox which part of the audit pick
that up
which part of the audience picked up
allegedly anybody who coordinated a lot
of people and brought their ballots to
one place and maybe they shouldn't have
been voting
how did they audit that
you can't order that
that's not even subject on it if you had
if you had direct evidence of it you
know somebody called it on tape or
there's a confession well then you could
make something of it but you can't audit
the thing you didn't see
right everything that happens before
that thing gets in The Ballot Box
all of that's invisible
and apparently that's where the the most
likely place that fraud would happen
well they're two places one would be if
some kind of a hacker situation got
involved and I see no evidence of that
but
it would be the thing that would be at
least in theory hard to find
do we audit the code
of the machines I don't think so
that's not a thing
because it's proprietary you can't audit
their code
so if you can't look at the code and you
can't look at anything that happens
before the actual whatever is stuck in
the whatever box
how do you know anything happened
all right so I'm going to go with uh the
fact that they charged uh Trump
who John Barron uh they charged John
Baron with a Rico is in my opinion a
guarantee that they are part of a
conspiracy that would be subject to Rico
if we had the evidence
what do you say
you don't think the media the
intelligence organizations and the
Democrats colluded toward a common
illegal uh goal of course they did
it seems kind of obvious
but you know again I'm only talking
about 2019 plus one so can't be
demonetized about that
we'll see
so there's a Washington Post story
that says blah blah Ukraine's having
trouble with their of their
counter-offensive
when you read The Washington Post
the least credible you know entity in
news
um
and you know the reporting about
something that they couldn't possibly
know anything about
which is how are things going on the
ground in Ukraine do you think they have
any sources that are telling them useful
information
so this story is not about Ukraine even
though they they have a story of
Washington Post says a story about it
the story is I laugh when people ask me
how bad I feel about being canceled in
newspapers
I actually took money from The
Washington Post when they were running
my comic
I always felt dirty about that honestly
I felt filthy that I was taking money
from the most corrupt industry and the
most corrupt entity within the most
corrupt industry the news
I hated that the fact that I don't have
to say I work for the Washington Post
you know indirectly through a comic
strip
is really freeing I like how that feels
yeah I like their money their money was
good but yeah I'll probably still eat
well anyway I don't know what's
happening in Ukraine but neither do they
that's the story on Ukraine
did I know Gary Larson no not personally
um we are obviously we know all the same
people in common I feel like I forgot a
story here what the heck was it
probably not
now looks like I added all bam I'm good
all right
um
so Trump has caused his election
claims uh event
so maybe that tells you he's not so
confident
all right Maui
um
I don't know what to say about it
I'll tell you what I think um
to look out for for fake news
there's a story about the the water
conservation guy or the water manager of
Maui and somehow he didn't allow the
water that was sacred to be used for the
fire I don't believe that story do you
do you believe that
do you believe that during the fire the
authorities said we need your water and
that he didn't release it
I I would some of you believe in some
now I would wait for a confirmation of
that one because that is too much of the
on the nose to it
you know just as the left wants to say
it was climate change all right that's a
little too on the nose right all right
that's a little convenience isn't it
um the fact that it could be the climate
change guy
really really the climate change you
know the one who's most associated with
you know loving the land I guess that
that he's that it'd be no he didn't
resign the the guy who resigned was the
head of uh the one who didn't sound the
alarm
that's a different guy
now the guy who didn't sound the alarm
actually had a reason which was the
the
guideline said don't use it for a fire
I mean effectively has had to use it for
just this and I think uh and his concern
was that people would if they hear the
tsunami thing they would had up
um
uphill and Uphill is where the fire was
however as others have pointed out
who sees a fire and runs toward it
and it wouldn't all the smoke in the air
almost immediately clue you in that your
tsunami was not your biggest immediate
problem right so I feel like it would
have taken about like a minute and a
half for the crowds in the street to
talk to each other and say no no they
just sounded in your arm it's that fire
just run away from the fire
yeah so I'm going to go with the people
who say you should have done the alarm
and if the reason he didn't is because
there was a guideline about it
then the guidelines the problem that I
am
do you know why
you cannot ask somebody in that
situation to
to uh ignore a guideline
because he would be fired if so well if
somebody died because he because he
ignored the guideline if somebody died
because of that that would be on him
and that's more than you can ask an
official in that situation so I'm going
to say you know we wish he had acted
like a hero okay we wish he'd use this
common sense and done something
different okay
I'm with you on that but he was in the
situation where making that decision was
stupid for himself in other words not
doing something
probably felt like the smarter thing
than doing something that was against
the policy and being the reason somebody
died
you don't want to you don't want
somebody to die and you violated the
policy in a way that looks like it
caused it that's the worst
so it's it's super bad that maybe he was
responsible for people dying even more
than if he'd done the wrong thing
but we don't know so it's bad either way
but I'm going to say I would put a
little more pressure on the guidelines
for not being sufficient to give him you
know warning here's what the guideline
showed us at
uh this siren is only for this purpose
but use your judgment
right
it wouldn't wouldn't that have solved
everything
just better guidelines this guideline
should only be used for tsunami but if
something else comes up
you know if we're attacked by aliens use
your judgment
that's what it should have said if it
had only said use your judgment
you know there could be an exception
that requires people to get out of their
homes
everyone everything would be fine
I I blame who wrote the guidelines
yeah I blame the guideline writer not
not the person who followed it because
that was an impossible situation
we think he chose wrong
but you'd have to be in that situation
to know to know that he was risking his
life
If he if he did a positive thing that
killed somebody he was risking his life
if he followed the guidelines and things
went wrong
and he probably had some wishful
thinking that it wouldn't go wrong
because I don't you know do you think he
could have imagined
the type of Devastation that was coming
do you think in his head he knew what
the end State looked like I don't think
so
you think so
no I don't think anybody could have even
imagined what would happen to Lina even
if you saw the fire coming you know from
the Lesser populated part of the island
you know and you saw hitting even the
suburbs
it would be just hard for you to imagine
that everybody couldn't get out
like you don't see fires Moving 80 miles
an hour which is about what it was doing
all right and we will leave Britney
Spears alone
it's a personal situation and
that's all for now I will talk to you
later YouTube thanks for being awesome
