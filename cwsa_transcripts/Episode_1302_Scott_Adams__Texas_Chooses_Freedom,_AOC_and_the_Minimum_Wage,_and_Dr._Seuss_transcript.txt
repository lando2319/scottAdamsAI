[Applause]
well
today is gonna be one of the best
coffees with scott adams of all time i'm
going to say that again but make it
sound
like extreme sports
today coffee with scott adams extreme
it's better that way it really is if
you'd like to make it
even more extreme even better
what would it take hmm would it take a
couple of muggle glasses
tank or challenge to sign a canteen
jager flask vessel of any kind
yes it would and i recommend
filling that vessel with the liquid of
your choice
any kind for the dopamine push of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
yeah it's that good it's that good don't
miss it here it comes go
ah i feel so bad for the people who
missed this
don't you a little bit a little bit of
guilt
well let's talk about all the things
possibly
my favorite story of the day you might
not have heard this yet
apparently the bbc and in this context
the bbc refers to the british
broadcasting corporation
if you thought bbc meant something else
well you've been spending a little bit
too much time on the wrong websites
or the right websites i'm not going to
make a judgment
but anyway the bbc the one that does
news
has apologized for airing an interview
with someone posing as senator booker
is that perfect so apparently some
imposter
called up saying he was senator booker
cory booker
and did an entire interview on the bbc
now here's my first question was the
interview by the fake
cory booker better
or worse than the real cory booker
because what is missing from the story
is all the crazy stuff
that the imposter said what if the
imposter was just as good as the
original
what if they couldn't tell do we need an
original if the imposter does just as
well i suppose we did
yes and the joke is i am not spartacus
sometimes sometimes you think i'm
spartacus
but i'm not actually spartacus maybe
he's spartacus
definitely not me i'm not spartacus but
that guy looks a little
spartacus-y if you know what i'm talking
about
go talk to him so what happens
now this was a radio interview i i
should have mentioned that so it was
audio only so it's easier to fake
but what happens what happens
when somebody can make a uh
a deep fake that just mimics their own
mouth motions so you think you're
calling in on a zoom to do an interview
or something
and and somebody just puts up a fake
how how far are we from an entire fake
video answering interview questions
now it would require a real person
behind the scenes i'm not talking about
ai
but ai pretty soon too right pretty soon
20 years it's going to take longer for
an ai to look exactly like a human in
terms of how it acts
but maybe not 20. maybe 10.
i've noticed a difference in my trolls
my trolls are very very different lately
these days my trolls come in and they
blame me publicly on twitter usually
for not criticizing trump
on some topic that i did criticize trump
so it's not like i haven't criticized
them but all of my
all my trolls are coming in and saying
why didn't you say something when
trump was putting kids in cages to which
i say
i did i did and
why didn't you say something when you
know trump wasn't doing all the right
things in the the pandemic
to which i say i did i did i did do that
so i've completely run out of trolls
can somebody put out the word that i'm
under trolled
it's just not the same i don't want
people who agree with me trying to troll
me
can i get somebody who disagrees please
just somebody who disagrees with me
could you troll me
anybody just somebody who's got a
different opinion
i miss you i miss you the good trolls
well texas and mississippi are leading
the way and
i'm going to give texas the the big
credit here so the governor has said
governor abbott has said texas is going
to open up
every business is allowed to open of
course the businesses
can decide on their own but they're
allowed to open and
there is no state mandate for masks
now does saying there is no state
mandate for masks
mean that everybody will stop wearing
masks
no no it doesn't mean that do you know
why
because texans are not a bunch of
freaking morons
surprise surprise turns out there's a
lot of
smart responsible people living in texas
and those who damn well better protect
themselves until they get the
vaccination
yeah they'll wear masks or they'll
not socially you know mingle with people
who might be infected
so i think you can trust at least at
this point i don't think you could trust
it early on in the pandemic
because people were not as well informed
not as well trained
but i think you can trust that the
people in texas who are at risk
will make the damn decision themselves
they will make the decision
now let's talk about whether texas is
doing the right thing
or the wrong thing how many of you are
positive that texas is doing the right
thing
and then how many of you are positive
that it's the wrong thing it's too early
whereas the governor of california said
it's reckless
as reckless well
here's the argument and you have to look
at all the variables if you look at one
variable
of course you're being dumb variable
number one
will opening up texas lead to more
infections and
death what do you think do you think
that texas opening up
is is pretty much guaranteed to have
some extra deaths we don't know how many
hoping it's not a new surge
but when you say reasonably it's it's
fair to say there will be more deaths
if you loosen up a little bit now even
even if you're arguing you know that
sweden did well etc
they still had extra deaths so i don't
think anybody's arguing that there won't
be
extra deaths right are we on the same
page
the the texas is pretty much guaranteed
by their actions to have some extra
deaths now anybody who says no i think
you're just not informed
because there's no expert who thinks
that the
that the measures have zero effect
there are plenty of people who say i
don't know if it's enough of an effect
to be worth the the pain is causing but
i don't believe there's
anybody who says anybody who's an expert
who says that you'd have exactly the
same death rate no matter what you do
i don't believe anybody says that um at
least in terms of
the the virus they might they might say
it in terms of net
but not in terms of the virus so is it
the right decision
or the wrong decision here's the best
argument i heard
and i would recommend this as a good
filter on this
question question number one
does the government know the right
answer
for you say you you are one individual
you live in texas
you're just one person you're not an
average person
because nobody is the average
everybody's a person
does texas know what would be the best
thing for you
specifically i'm not talking about
what's best for the state
but does texas know what's best for you
specifically the answer is no
because if if our government was so well
informed
and our science was so accurate that the
government could say something
like look there's a 99
chance that what we're doing is the
right thing i know it's inconvenient i
know people are gonna
have lots of costs but we're 99 sure
we're doing the right thing in general
now if that were the situation
i would feel that the government had
some
moral right
in other words if they're really they
got good information they're trying to
save the most
lives they can i feel as if they do have
a moral
right to maybe force people like me to
do some things i don't want to do
in the short run right i don't have a
big problem with that concept
but what happens if the government
doesn't know what to do
what if the government is not sure if
keeping things closed is better net
if you look at the net effect of mental
health and everything else suicides drug
addictions
what if the government itself can't tell
it can't tell if it's good for you or
not well then you default
to personal freedom
that is the correct decision we live in
a country where the correct
default the thing you do if you don't
know what to do
is individual freedom now if we had
really strong indication
that that so-called individual freedom
would lead to
a catastrophe of untold proportions well
then i think that
the state government has a role in being
the adult in the room and forcing you to
do what you don't want to do
because it's good for everybody right
there can be those situations
but this isn't that we we are close
enough to the end of the pandemic
whether it's six months from now or
whatever it is
that i do think that texas has a
completely
valid argument that they texas
can't tell they can't tell what's good
for you
and if you can't tell there is only one
morally and ethically responsible thing
to do
leave it to the people now educate them
as much as you can
right do as much as you can to minimize
minimize risk but you have to default to
freedom in this situation
now should everybody do it
do you think all of the other states
california should just say ah
texas is doing it let's do it nope
no even if you think that what texas is
doing is 100
the right thing to do that does not mean
that the other states should do it
because i'm in california
we'll probably stay locked down longer
than other people even in california
although i am jealous i'm envious of the
texans who have more
freedom that i have i'm okay waiting
and the reason i'm okay waiting is that
i don't mind
texas being the control
the control case right i would like to
see if texas
runs into a big problem because they're
handling things differently
but i want to keep california the same
just long enough
to know for sure all right i feel as if
it's worth
risking a state or two to leave them
behind long enough to see if there's
some big difference
if it happens to be my state that's not
ideal but whether or not my state had
changed things i probably would have
acted the same
or very similarly i mean i could have
gone to more places
but i probably would have stayed out of
uh you know even if the restaurant said
you could go there and
for full capacity
put yourself in my shoes i've got asthma
i'll be 64 in a few months so i'm sort
of on the edge of the bubble
depending on your point of view of risky
risky people
if california opened up like texas i
wouldn't go back to normal
because i might have only one more month
before i'm vaccinated maybe a month
i'll tell you my my personal risk
management assessment
is if it's really one month and i think
it is before i get vaccinated
i'm going to be extra careful for one
month
does that mean does that not make sense
that i should be extra careful
because now that's only one month that's
not big risk to save my life
you know if there's some deadly risk if
it were
six months maybe maybe i'd say i gotta
live
but one month i can wait one month
you know i'm gonna and i think a lot of
texans
especially anybody over 60 is going to
say the same thing
you know if they want to take the risk
they have the option now
so i think this is great i just don't
know
that you could say with any confidence
that it will work
as well as they hope it will but it's
great
that they've made the decision with this
bias
a bias toward freedom every time you see
a bias toward freedom
you got to be happy about that right
even if it's the wrong
even if it works out poorly you sort of
got to be glad
that texas exists so thanks for texas
you know i keep watching this developing
situation of immigration
and you know the more unattended kids
and i guess the predictions are over a
hundred thousand
unattended kids will show up and and
there does seem to be clear indication
that the smugglers are you know the
people who smuggle
the kids across the border that they've
stepped up operations because they think
biden will be soft on immigration
and and they seem to be right so
given that every republican in the world
said hey if you make it desirable and
easy and
better to come to the united states than
staying where you will
where you are you'll get more people and
sure enough
that's exactly what's happening now i
feel like
what's different and special about this
border situation
is you had such a a clear democrat
standard of what what you could or or
could not do at the border
and i don't think they're going to be
able to hold it because they're either
going to create a humanitarian disaster
by being too good to people which looks
like that's developing
or they're going to have to change the
policy and make it like trump
so what happens if this what's special
about the border situation
is you don't have to wait a long time to
see how it turned out
how long would it take you to find out
if something you did for the green new
deal
worked it could take decades right you
might not know
for years and years whether the vast
expenses or changes
you're doing for the green new deal are
going to work
but with the border stuff i think we'll
know with complete certainty within one
year right
within one year i don't think we'll be
arguing
whether letting everybody in and being
friendly to the children and especially
kind
we're not going to wonder what that did
because we'll just look at it we'll know
so what happens if it's a disaster
because it it looks like it's shaping up
that way
but honestly i would still like to
still like to bet on the government
i know that's the worst bet betting on
the government to do anything right
it's a terrible bet but the thing i
don't do
that a lot of you and my audience do is
that just because we
i can't figure out how something could
be done
i don't assume that it can't be done now
in my mind i can't think of
any way that making it really really
easy and desirable
to get into this country illegally i
don't see
any way that can work but i'm also open
to
maybe somebody does maybe we maybe we
test something um i've always wondered
what would happen if you built
in a special opportunity zone
right along the southern border of the
united states
i'm just going to toss this idea out
here suppose the united states says
we're going to build a
zone where you can move your
manufacturing from
china to here and for however many years
you won't pay any taxes or there'd be
tax
rebates maybe there's no minimum wage
and what you would do is build this like
you know manufacturing
zone that would absorb the people coming
over the border
so they would come over the border but
then they would learn english and they
would learn a skill
they would have a job they'd be doing
something that's good for the country
and they wouldn't even get into the
interior of the country because you
would have a whole
you know zone which would be the very
best place for them to go
because it would be built for them it
would be built for a place that
wants as many employees as they can get
come on over
but it would be american owned and run
and you would just use it as
an immigration control that has the
secondary benefit
of um you know reducing our dependence
on china
could you do that i don't know so i
don't know if any of that would be
practical or economic but
you can imagine you could imagine
really creative ways to approach
immigration
which as aoc says and i'm the only
person
on this live stream who's willing to say
this
i like the fact that she wants to do
something that we don't know how to do
i like that i want my leaders to be
pushing us to do things
that look kind of impossible and this
looks kind of impossible
let being kind to people on the border
at the same time you're controlling your
own country's fate
i don't know how to do it do you i don't
know anybody who knows how to do it
aoc is pushing it without knowing how to
do it
i don't hate that we can't do it until
we know how to do it
but i can't hate the fact that she
pushes the impossible
i kind of like it i think that's you
know mentally that's where i like to be
is you know how do we do the impossible
as opposed to saying well that's
impossible
walk away can't do it so
i think she's a valuable asset even if
you think all of her ideas are bad
but what's going to happen with the kids
in cages situation
should have some carryover effect to
other democrat stuff
what happens if the let's say
hypothetically
and it looks like it's heading in that
direction let's say the disaster poli
or the immigration policies of the biden
administration
become an un uh unambiguous disaster
so much so that even democrats say oh
this is a disaster it didn't work
what would happen to their other
policies because isn't the main problem
with democrat policies
that they have somewhat lofty objectives
which you might like
you know everybody's doing well and
making money and there's fairness and
equality those things all sound great
who's against any of that but if you
don't know how to get there
that's the problem so i'm thinking that
even the green new deal will suffer
if the immigration thing falls apart
because it will
feel the same immigration has this weird
quality where you say to yourself
wait a minute human nature guarantees
that your plan can't work
and i think people will just take that
thinking to other democrat
policies so i think the democrats are
really in trouble
with immigration not just because of
immigration
here's a question to you
and i'll base this on overhearing
something the other day
i was in a position the other day to
overhear some teens
talking about you know
i'm gonna be as generic as possible
talking about
lifestyle things and you know some
things that would be
in the general social discussion let's
say
and i was blown away
i mean absolutely blown away because
things coming out of the mouths
of young people very unfamiliar
to what i would have heard in my day is
it better or is it worse
probably better probably better because
what i heard was
an insane amount of lack of bigotry
insane like a
kind of an open mindedness that
is just shocking in a good way
it's shockingly healthy
to hear young people with not even a
trace
of what you would have considered i
guess a normal amount of bigotry use
sexism
anti whatever anti this is that it's
really weird
but at the same time the young people
will talk
quite bluntly about ethnicity like
that's very
much on the top of people's thoughts you
know
this group and this but has more to do
with clicks and who's friends with who
and it doesn't seem to be about race it
seems about more about
who's hanging out with who but i'll tell
you if you want to
if you want to feel or as or see the
future
if you want to see the future you got to
listen to kids
talking candidly it's pretty positive
but here's the bigger question i have
could you teach
kids if you get them young to be
politically
independent you could
but would we because you'd be taking
away the parents
responsibility in some sense because you
know you think the parents are the ones
who should determine their
their opinions as opposed to the school
but i wonder if you couldn't teach young
kids
that blindly joining a political party
and assuming that everything that one
party says is right
and everything the other party says is
wrong couldn't you teach them just
that that's always wrong just to prepare
them
for the fact that the other side some
has sometimes is right
i feel as if you could prime them to
make them a little bit more fluid in
later life
about whether they would you know
cross-party lines or
or just be open-minded to stuff so i
know you couldn't teach a kid to be a
republican
or a democrat because that would be way
over the line but couldn't you teach
them how to not
fall into a team mentality
and you don't even have to mention which
team you're talking about just
don't don't make your decisions based on
the team that's it
i think you could we get them young
enough and that seems like that would be
valuable because
most of our current problems are this
team play stuff
um there was an article
on february 21st in wall street journal
by martin
uh koldorf koldorf seems to know what
he's talking about from
john johns hopkins so he's you know a
medical professional from a credible
place
and he's saying that in this article
it's now a few weeks old
that the number of uh coveted cases
that how rapidly it dropped in in
january
can't be explained by the holiday
traffic
now i i had been saying uh duh
infections are down because it's not
christmas anymore
and you could pretty much track the
holidays or the spikes
and then after the holidays things calm
down it's pretty universal
and so i thought it was pretty clear
to me it seemed i could be wrong
but to me it seems really obvious
that the uh traveling for the holidays
is the big
big problem and that when it's done
you would get less of it and it makes
sense to me because i would think
if i were to put the single biggest
variable
it would have to be the amount of time
you spend indoors
with a bad ventilation so i'm not
counting
let's say if you're in africa or india
you always have your windows open
because it's always hot so that's
different but if you're indoors with the
windows closed
it's how many people are coming in and
out and are in close contact
it's probably just that when i say just
is probably
60 of all infections or exactly that
something that happens in your own house
or in a house
so i don't know how the i don't know how
holidays could not be the explanation
of most of the dip but his claim is that
um
the only way to explain it would be if
people have
t cell immunity from related
coronaviruses maybe
or there's way more infection so we have
more demonic
herd immunity than we know what do you
think
do you think that we can just look at
this data
can we just look at the curves and look
at the data
and make the conclusion that
it's t cell immunity
i feel like i feel like that's a little
too far
i feel like we don't have the data to
say that that's the case
but his his case is uh it's an argument
by
uh ruling out the other things so
can you rule out the most obvious thing
which is that holiday travel brought
people together who don't get together
and put them indoors for a long period
of time
so i'm going to say i don't buy it i
don't buy it
i do buy the general notion that there
might be more immunity in the public
than we know
and then it might be a pretty big
variable
but i think the big dip had to be the
holidays i just feel that way
all right we need more yeah need more
information
so apparently uh some more rocket
attacks are happening in iraq
on american military bases
and there was a contractor who died from
a heart attack during an airstrike
so i don't know was it the air strike
that killed him
i guess you could say so and here's the
real question
so now that biden had responded to the
last
attack by iranian surrogates is this
iran
just seeing how far they can push biden
is that what's going on
because if iran is saying oh we'll just
keep pushing
just keep pushing would they have done
this under trump
do you think that iran would have
attacked
a second military base through a proxy
not directly
do you think they would have approved
that attack under trump
i feel as if no but you can't know right
but the thing that trump had going for
him is that he was less predictable
and i feel like we put mr predictable
into the office
and iran is just running with it because
they can predict him
maybe we'll see um
so i guess uh governor cuomo of new york
was stripped of his emergency coveted
powers
uh you know just weeks before they would
have expired anyway
can new york get any dumber i think new
york is just
it seems to be setting new records for
dumbness
because i don't believe that the
governor's emergency powers
were really the problem here was anybody
arguing you know
he did he did ask if he could kiss
that woman two years ago so therefore
he should not have emergency covert
powers
what i feel like new york is just
shooting themselves in the foot
because they're mad at their governor
why would you want to take away his
tools
if you're keeping him in the job yeah
we'd like you to still be
you know in charge but could you do it
with fewer tools
well why would i do it with fewer tools
no reason
it's you know has something to do with a
girl you tried to kiss a woman you tried
to kiss
so how does that make sense it's just
like new york
proving how dumb they are
no matter how mad you are at your
governor all right are you ready for the
most
controversial part of this periscope
are you ready i'm going to bring up a
topic you hate
but i'm going to put a new twist on it
so you should stay for the new twist
all right because it's even new for me
there's a erasmus and poll on what
people
think about uh transgender athletes and
specifically of course everybody's
talking about
um transgender athletes playing
women's sports and
we found that the majority of the public
is against it majority of the public
doesn't favor uh transgender
being able to play on women's sports
teams
and uh so we should go with the majority
right
what do you say live it we live in a
sort of a democracy-ish kind of a place
should we go with the majority
all right well here's something that you
could pull out of these numbers
the rasmussen poll women under 40.
57 favor transgender
athletes playing female sports so the
the category of people who are most
directly affected besides the athletes
the transgender athletes themselves
are women under 40 because they would be
the ones on professional teams
the ones who recently uh recently played
sports you know not that long ago
in high school and college and would
even be having kids
at 40 you know that's the age where your
kids are getting into
athletics early in school and that group
the ones most directly
victimized can i use that word
because that's how it's being spoken i
don't use that word to speak of this
but some people are saying hey what
about that
um that uh biologically born
female athlete who now can't get first
place
because the transgender athlete is just
getting all the medals and winning
everything if the people who are most
affected
are by a strong majority in favor of
doing it
is it any of your business
do you think everybody should have the
same weight
of opinion if there's only one group
that is the
is impacted by it
right should these two people have the
same
vote on this topic there's a there's a
hermit
living in the alaska outback
american citizen so american citizens
get to vote get to have an opinion
but doesn't have a kid it's a man it's a
hermit
living in alaska how is that person
in any way important to this question of
transgender athletes
completely unrelated does that person's
opinion
should account as much as somebody who
is the very
center of the question which is
non-transgender athletes who would be
affected by having
people on the team that are superior
athletes
what is fair so forget about the
question forget about the topic
forget about the the topic being
transgender athletes
just forget about it just as answer the
question in the generic
question if the people who are most
affected
victimized if you want to call it that
say let's do this by a strong majority
this is a strong majority
right it's overwhelming
shouldn't they get what they want what
what
why is it the hermit in alaska who gets
an equal vote
somebody says stop all right you're
going to go away
rose you don't get to be here anymore
um a hide user on this channel okay
you're gone
now again uh i'm open to any counter
arguments i like counter arguments and
in fact
this is weird but i enjoy being proven
wrong
because i think it makes this better you
know the the thing i do
anytime i can be proven wrong and and
it's confirmed
that's kind of exciting to me because i
don't i don't feel any shame from that
i feel like everybody's wrong so if you
can learn something
good all right so my only thing i'm
going to add to that is
although legally everybody gets the same
vote in this country we don't want to
change that
sometimes you should look at who's
affected
right and to me that matters all right
aoc is making more news by saying the
minimum wage
should be raised of course but i want to
show you her
argument style all right
so here's a tweet and we'll we'll talk
about whether the minimum
rate wage should be raised but that's
going to be separate here i'm just going
to talk about her
her technique her persuasion okay so i
told you i try to teach you something
every
live stream and here we're going to
learn from aoc's technique the same way
we would learn from trump's
persuasion technique here's the tweet
aoc says
it is utterly embarrassing that quote
pay people enough to live
is a stance that's even up for debate
override the parliamentarian and raise
the wage
so she's asking her own party to act
differently asking
biden and uh and harris to override this
uh mcdonald's workers in denmark are
paid twenty two dollars an hour plus six
weeks paid vacation
fifteen 15 an hour which is what she
wants in this country
is a deep compromise a big one
considering the phase-in
i mean considering you don't even get
the 15 for a number of years
now let's talk about her her technique
i love starting out with it's utterly
embarrassing
because she's taken an economic question
and moved it directly into
feelings if you're going to influence
somebody you want to go for the fields
because they'll always argue you on the
data
if she made her argument entirely upon
data
people would just argue the data they'd
say well you don't know that and
can't be sure that's it so arguing with
data would have no
real value so she doesn't
that that's what makes her you know a
little bit better than
other politicians she doesn't do the
thing that won't work in terms of
persuasion
then she says that to pay people enough
to live is a stance that's even up for
debate
that is really really good framing
even if you don't agree with her point
we're not talking about the politics of
the policy
but uh that's just so well said
i mean it's just framed with perfect
persuasion
and then she goes on saying what she
would like to be done
again perfect persuasion your persuasion
is useless
if you make a point and don't have a
specific thing you're asking for
so she makes her point goes right to the
specific request
again perfect form and then she says
that
then she does the comparison thing where
you make a big first
ask so that whatever you're asking for
sounds not so bad
so she uses the denmark comparison
because 22 is such a big number when
you're only talking about raising it to
15
that your brain starts to say wait a
minute denmark's at 22
and and the country is now falling apart
denmark's doing okay
15 doesn't sound so bad don't get ahead
of me don't get ahead of me
i know what you're going to do i'll get
there i'll get there
it's not all good so i read that i
thought
well that's pretty good argument now for
background
aoc has a background in economics a lot
of people don't understand that
in college he she actually has an
economics degree
as do i i have a degree in economics in
an mba
and if you were to ask me scott forget
about the morality part
forget about the morality just does this
work
economically because
the things you're looking at is you're
not just raising
you know somebody's pay is coming out of
somebody's pocket
so how many businesses will go on a
business how many fewer employees can be
employed because now you can't afford as
many of them
how do you do the math and figure out
what works
now wouldn't you say scott every time
you depart from the free market
and you put the government in there you
get a worse result
how many of you believe that in the
comments tell me
is that the fair thing to say there's a
good general statement
that whenever you remove the free market
and insert
government control that's never good
right never good
well if you believe that why do we have
a minimum wage
now
why do we have a minimum wage now do you
know
i wasn't i can't remember specifically
but don't you think
that whenever the minimum wage was put
in place
or the minimum wage was raised don't you
think we had this same argument every
time
was it right the last time do you
remember when they raised the minimum
wage to what it is now and then the
economy
fell apart it didn't
it didn't it's the same argument that we
know
wasn't true before we don't have to
guess
we know because the minimum wage has
been raised before
and and the country survived now did it
cost people jobs yes of course
did some businesses probably go out of
business yeah the ones that were so weak
so weak they couldn't afford to do this
were those businesses going to last
were those the businesses were paying a
lot of taxes
no they couldn't have been paying a lot
of taxes because they didn't have enough
margin
to even give their employees a raise so
you have you have two arguments here and
they're both
pretty good and they're on different
sides
the pretty good argument against raising
it is
free markets are better you won't get
people coming into the market who would
only take those low jobs
they couldn't get a better one so you're
not training people
yeah so the argument against it is
completely solid completely
i mean it's you know human motivation is
very
predictable there will be fewer people
hired
in in the short run but on the other
hand
the aoc argument is there are plenty of
cases
where people argue this same thing was
going to happen
and it didn't we just adjusted
we just adjusted somehow
so here i am sitting here with
uh two degrees
that should allow me to answer this
question and have a
like a really smart opinion that it's a
good idea
or that it's a bad idea to raise the
minimum wage
i don't do you
you've watched me for a long time and i
honestly don't know
if this is a good idea or a bad idea and
i
don't even know how you check because i
wouldn't believe anybody's
prediction would you would would you
believe anybody's
economic projection of what would happen
if we did it i wouldn't
because the one thing i do know is that
i wouldn't trust any economic prediction
would you and if you don't trust the
experts
what are you going on what are you going
on
all right but here's the punchline to
the whole thing
while it is a tremendously good
persuasion play
to say that denmark has 22 dollars an
hour and all this
paid vacation and stuff uh it took about
a minute
for somebody to come into the comments
and say
denmark doesn't have a minimum wage
the whole thing is denmark
doesn't have
a state mandated minimum wage
they just don't have one so the whole
argument is just completely
 but did it work
yeah yeah it works really well as an
argument it works really well
it works as well as president trump
saying
you know your your tv won't work when
the windmills
stop turning right it's not exactly
the most honest argument in the world
but you get the point
right you get the point so it's the same
technique
all right so just as
president trump uh did not pass a lot of
the fact checking
but yet he was amazingly like good
at persuading and the things that he
persuaded toward were also good
i can't even think of an exception right
i mean arguably i can't think of any
exception so i don't mind
that trump you know plays fast and loose
with the facts as long as the direction
he's going
is quite obviously a good direction for
the country and a lot of people's
opinion
that's fair aoc is doing the same um
here's a question for you
um well actually let's let's talk about
dr seuss
how many of you have now seen the
so-called offensive
uh racially offensive dr seuss
drawings it's been in the news for a
while
that there are some dr seuss books with
racially offensive drawings how many of
you
have seen them because i'll bet you all
have opinions don't you
how many of you have seen them i have
now seen them
thanks to a tweet by joel
and it's the only place i've seen them i
haven't seen them
anywhere else except one tweet pointing
to a blog article
and that was you know joel pollock who
pointed to the article he didn't write
the article
and i'm looking at your answers and i
only see
one person says they've seen them but
you all have opinions don't you
oh some number if you've seen them so
for those who hadn't seen them and then
you did
did it change your opinion did you get a
different opinion after you looked at
them
i did i did let me tell you what my
first thought was
we we weren't being shown the pictures
and that led me to believe that maybe
they weren't that bad
because if they were that bad wouldn't
they just show them
because the media leans left right so if
they were really that bad
i feel like we would definitely would
have seen them so i was
i was biased toward thinking there's
probably nothing there it's probably
imagination and you're you're reading
into it a little bit
and then i looked at them
they're pretty bad by today's standards
by today's standards pretty bad
pretty bad by the standards of when they
were drawn
not at all not at all i mean if you put
it back in its
historical context i don't even know if
anybody would have even raised
an eyebrow the the most
i'll describe them for you so there are
three images i saw in particular one was
some probably a middle eastern um
i imagine an islamic guy riding a camel
wearing sort of traditional look and
having
you know a cartoon face that looks
caricaturish
of the region not too bad
i would say i would say on that one if
that had been the worst one
i would say give it a pass because
really it looked like more they were
trying to get the clothing right
it didn't look like i don't know is
riding a camel
somehow an insult if people actually
ride camels and it's a thing i don't
know
that one didn't look bad then i looked
at the next one
it was some uh characters drawn as
chinese characters
that looked like a fu manchu you know
with robes and
you know little facial hair that you
would see in some stereotype
and they were carrying on their head i
think there were three or four of them
they were carrying on their heads as if
they were porters you know carry things
on their heads
a big cage with some dr seuss animal but
then at the top
the top of the cage was this drawing of
a little
white hunter so
you've got the the chinese characters
carrying on their head a cage of an
animal and on top of it
the white guy
not so good but if you take it back in
time
who was it who were the porters if you
went to china
and you organized an expedition who
would be carrying the stuff
chinese citizens right so if you just
put it in its context
it's actually what it would look like if
you don't
factor in that he made all the chinese
characters look
um let's say stereotypical of that day
and not in a good way so that what i
would say was
was a problem yeah i i could see how
somebody would say yeah let's
let's let's this is a little marginal
let's uh
get rid of this one but then the third
one showed some uh
black characters from africa carrying
some other dr seuss
character and then i get a little bit
more of a problem
the black characters may i
may i use an offensive word if i tell
you that there's no
offensive intention okay so what i'm
gonna say
next will sound defensive but it's not
my intention
so intention matters more than words or
they should
i'm just gonna say it all right
he drew the black characters to look
like monkeys
all right now if that doesn't offend you
i don't know what would i mean that's
about as offensive as you can get
now was he thinking that
when he drew them or is it just an
artifact from his drawing style
which is it just fell out that way but
he wasn't thinking of it in any way like
that
it's a problem now i said before that
the easiest way to solve it would just
be
find find a black cartoonist and just
say hey do us a favor
can you redraw these so that we can tell
they're african
natives but they don't seem offensive to
you
just just give us a hand i mean if you
looked at like the whole body of
dr seuss works they're only just a few
pictures
why don't we just have the people who
are most you know
the victim of that characterization
have them you know take a shot at it
just redraw it annotate it make sure
everybody can see the original
and tell them why you changed it i don't
think it's a big problem
i think it's easy to solve just have a
little bit of
technique just get the right person
involved it's just
it literally would be one drawing out of
a whole book
no big deal i wouldn't lose the original
though
um here's a provocative
sexist hypothesis from user
novicus on twitter and i'll try to
characterize the claim is that the
societies
that have the most gender equality are
also the most ethically
and morally superior so it's a two-part
opinion do you agree with the first part
that societies that have the most uh um
gender equality are
and it's not a coincidence that they're
more ethically and morally superior
do you buy that might be an opinion
social opinion sort of thing but i do
that's that's you
i would say observationally that feels
about right doesn't
i've seen a lot of people say no
i don't think that the people saying no
have a bad argument
by the way but i'm a little surprised
that there is many no's
oh interesting okay all right but let me
just finish the point so this is not my
point i'm just putting it out there
that wherever you have more women with
more equality there's more
moral superiority but it's also the
reason you're doomed
it's also the reason you're doomed
because the country with the most
morality and equality
will be the weakest country in terms of
homeland defense
that all of those things that make you
ethically and morally superior
put you in peril right because
if you want to be protected
you want the person on your side who's
the worst person in the world
you don't want the ethically and morally
appropriate warriors on your side you
want the ones who will burn the village
right i mean you wouldn't say it out
loud
but if you had a choice between your
country being destroyed and you being
killed
or your military people
might be kind of bad ass might kill a
little bit more than you expected
might take more chances might do a lot
of things that maybe you wouldn't think
are a good idea
but maybe you need that see the trouble
is that
the more dangerous you are
the more likely uh even if you lose nine
out of ten times
if you're the more dangerous one you
only have to win that one time
and then you're in charge so
somebody says that's why sweden is in
bad shape i don't know if that can be
proven by any data but i do think this
is an interesting point
that the nicer you are as a society the
more vulnerable you are to
societies that are not as nice now the
way
novak has put it is that they are male
dominated societies
if you look at russia male dominated
china
male dominated those are two biggest
problems
and would those male-dominated cultures
produce let's say let's take china for
example
we believe that china is doing all these
terrible things
to us from shipping as fentanyl to
stealing our ip to spying to gathering
our dna
to all these things would china be doing
all of those things if they had a gender
gender equal society with women in
charge as much as men
would they do all those things what do
you think
what do you think would would
china be as aggressive if they had
gender equality
i feel like they would be less
aggressive and that
there's something to this hypothesis
so anyway i just put that out there it's
very sexist
but it does match it matches observation
even if my observation is so biased that
i can't see
i can't see it clearly somebody says the
ccp
is not china yeah that's that's a fair
statement
but the communist party is male
dominated so
that's the point um
they have 100 million excess men
somebody says
do they um
china has no diversity on their
corporate boards of directors
um in the future
yeah all right so that's all i got for
today
and i will talk to you tomorrow
all right youtubers um
yeah it's from the one child family rule
i guess
swedes get paid five weeks vacation
somebody says um
why do i always wear the same shirt uh
i i do this in my pajamas so the the the
shirt you see is the shirt that i wore
to bed
so i i'm always in my pajamas
i can prove it
pajamas and i'm always barefoot
so um i i've created this entire
show which now has you know national uh
prominence
and i've never once worn uh pants
i mean i have i have pajamas on and i've
never done it in my shoes
so i like a job that you can do in your
pajamas
without shoes
and make a lot of money now i'm not
making a lot of money
but it is monetized
um yeah this is the best way to do a
show
do i still go on other people's podcasts
not at the moment
the i'll confess something to you right
now
the enjoyment i get and then doing this
and also the content i do for
locals which is a subscription site
where i put a lot of my content
that you don't get to see um i
enjoy that so much that my cartooning
it's just hard for me to do it like it's
30 years of drawing these same
characters it's really hard now to make
myself sit down and do it one more time
which is what i have to do today and
uh i'm way behind deadline
or i'm too close to the deadline
actually so i've got to get ahead on
deadlines it's going to take me a few
months
and that's all um
will you have on jovan pulitzer no
no there's a certain type of guest that
i'll never have on
and that's anybody who can make a claim
that i don't know enough about
to ask the right questions and he would
be in that category
what school of economics did you learn i
wouldn't say it was a school of
economics i just have a degree in
economics so we
we got to see a lot of stuff
um
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you later
