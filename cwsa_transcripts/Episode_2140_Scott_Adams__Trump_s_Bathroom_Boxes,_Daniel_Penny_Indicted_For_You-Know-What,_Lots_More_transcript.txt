do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
better never been a better time
and if you'd like your experience to go
up to DARE we say UFO level all you need
is a cup of Margaret glass of tanker
jealous of style and a canteen jug of
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine here of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
ah
I feel like uh the right word to say if
you just ate or drank something
delicious
why do I feel like the right thing to
say would be burismo
oh it's the name of a Ukrainian Energy
company but it feels like if that were a
foreign language
you would you would sip it and you'd say
burismo
I don't know it just feels like the
right word
but that's not why you're here
what you'd like to hear is uh this new
study Jordan Peterson tweeted it down
today that says oral contraceptives make
you depressed
so oral contraceptives
can make you depressed
uh mostly the woman mostly the woman
who's taking it not other people around
her but other people around her too
they didn't study that but I've got a
feeling that the husband
not so delighted so I think the oral
contraceptive gets uh
causes depression possibly according to
one study in the person who takes it but
uh I think they should study the husband
I've got a feeling that guy's not so
happy either
um now you know what I say about studies
right
how what reliability should we put on
this study
hey it's a study it's science it's all
sizing
uh yeah maybe 25 cops so I would not say
this is confirmed to science however I I
I
remind you of my BS filter
now this is not a reliable filter as in
100 reliable
but the one that I use is that if the
science agrees with observation I'm more
likely to believe it
so for example The Sciences says
cigarette smoking could give you lung
cancer
well I actually know people who smokes
aggressive got lung cancer
and no one who didn't who got lung
cancer but you know the correlation
seems pretty pretty clear so that's
science that I largely believe
because in my real life I can see a play
out
but and I would say that's the same for
oral contraceptives in my in my vast
experience on this world
it looks true to me I've seen people's
personality change on oral
contraceptives in my opinion just my
opinion I saw personality changes
so
I tend to think it's true even if that
study was not reliable
Daniel Petty was indicted for being
white
should I say that a different way or is
it just so obvious I can just say it out
loud
is that obvious or do you do you think a
black person would have been indicted
for the same actions
like exactly the same
supposedly been a black marine and a
black person he was subduing and the
person subdued who was subdued got uh
died tragically
would a black person be indicted for
that
do you believe they would because I
don't believe they would
you know what I feel like the public has
a right to know I don't know if we have
a legal right but we have a moral and
ethical right to to know this
my understanding is that the
um the the indictment is because there
is a grand jury
the grand jury I understood had 23
people and they only needed 12 people to
vote Yes for indictment 12 and 23.
wouldn't you like to know the racial
composition of the twelve
you don't think that's important
you don't think that for the safety
and equity and protecting our
constitutional rights you should know if
if a situation that looks obviously
racial
it looks obviously racial you don't want
to know if the people who voted to
indict were all black
I have no reason to believe they were I
have no reason to believe that white
people didn't vote exactly the same as
everybody else I have no reason to
believe it
except that it's kind of suspiciously
got indicted
so under those circumstances in our
highly charged racial environment I
believe the public and I believe that
Daniel penny has a right to know the
racial construct of the people who voted
against him
if he got 12 black votes and no no
non-black votes what would you feel
about the indictment
would you feel that was our justice
system doing its job
I wouldn't
I would think obviously that should be
you know I don't know whatever you do if
there's a bad indictment but we don't
know that
it could be that 100 of the people were
white and they just said this is too far
and let the let the court work it out
because it's not obvious at our level
it's not obvious whether it was a crime
or not
but they want to look into it so I'm not
saying I know that I know what happened
there I'm saying that not knowing is
wrong
under our current climate Daniel penny
has an absolute moral right probably not
a legal right but he has an absolute
moral right to know the composition of
the people who voted for his indictment
does anybody disagree with that
again I don't think it's legal probably
you know those people are shielded in
some way
but absolute moral right to that
information
all right
um so Shifty shift escaped his Center
and apparently the sensor had attached
to it a 16 million dollar fine for his
lying to Congress and the country about
various things
um and I guess 20 Republicans joined the
Democrats voting against it and that was
enough to kill it
now what do you think about the 20
Republicans who voted against
censuring shift what do you think of
those 20 Republicans
somebody says good job
somebody says jerks somebody says uni
party traitor
not Republicans they're not really
Republicans name only cowards rhinos
rhinos bastards disgusting
that's all the things you're saying in
your comments I'm just reading gutless
all right well um I uh back the 20 I
backed the 20 that voted against it
so let that settle it a little bit
so I'm on the I'm on the side of the
gutless Traders
on this one
and the reason is that it wasn't a
precedent that you want
you don't want Congress fighting each
other 16 million dollars
you don't want that now if this had been
just a clean censure that just said hey
you lied to us and that's bad we want to
put it on record fine
I'm fine a clean sensor yeah but do you
really want your Congress people to be
finding each other amounts of money that
that destroy them no no I do not want
that president
I I think I thought I saw Thomas Massey
Sage vote against it but then I didn't
see him on the list of 20. so I don't
know what happened there but now
now that's too far the the reason that
Republicans have in my opinion
a let's say a more respected brand
that's just my opinion but I think the
Republicans have more respected brand
because sometimes they'll vote against
their political interest
to vote for what they think is right
this looked like this looked like an
example of 20 people
who is moral and ethical standard did
not allow them to play
what looked like pure politics
I was actually going to ask for the
names of the 20 who voted against it so
that I could give them some credit
so I could give them a little pat on the
back and say that's what I want that's
exactly what I want
what you did is exactly what I want
that's that's some governing there
because just going along with their own
team is not anything I want
I I really don't want the Republicans
who all line up against Republicans you
know just line up I like a little fight
I like some people who go against the
grade
rubber in all capital says Scott is so
wrong no accountability
do you want Congress to be able to uh
vote to fines against the minority is
that what you want just just say that
you want that
don't say you disagree with me
say you want the outcome so it's not
about me take take me out of it just
take my personality out of this how many
of you want the outcome where the party
in charge will be fighting the other
party for stuff they don't like
finding them
well some of you are saying yes that you
would like a world in which the ones in
charge get to punish the ones who are
not in charge for whatever they want as
long as they have the votes that's the
world you want
some people say yes I will accept your
yes
I would point out that that would be the
destruction of the Republic
is that not obvious to you
is it not obvious that would be the end
of the Republic
okay well if you don't see it you don't
see it let's go to the next story
well Tom fitton's getting some heat
today on Twitter
this story is so funny I'm not sure I
believe it all right so here here's the
gist of the story
that uh Tom Fenton who is the head of
what's the name of his organization
uh
uh Judicial Watch Right Judicial Watch
no although he's the head of Judicial
Watch he's not himself a lawyer
now I made the mistake once of referring
to him as a lawyer in some social media
context and he corrected me right Tom
Fenton corrected me said oh not a lawyer
you know I just run this organization
so
you know it's not like he's pretending
to be a lawyer so that's the first thing
you need to know
Tom Fenton is telling you he's not a
lawyer right he's saying that publicly
I'm not a lawyer
so if you didn't know that then that's
sort of on you because he's transparent
about it
however
the story says that he was giving Trump
some advice at some point about his
secret documents and believed that the
Clinton soccer president
which is where Clinton took stuff and in
the end some confidential tapes that he
had recordings and in the end it was
decided that the the act of Simply
taking them
was enough to classify them as personal
and therefore there is no legal Jeopardy
so that seems like the same precedent
well the act of taking them makes them
personal by definition according to
their precedent end of the story
now Tom Fenton is getting all kinds of
 for what they think is bad legal
advice from somebody who's not a lawyer
do you see it that way
did do you see that the soccer case is
bad legal advice
well I think the bad legal advice was
that because he had the right to the
documents
that he should resist giving them back
I think it's the resisting giving back
that that is the real problem
so
I saw some uh I looked at some MSNBC
crap today to see what they were saying
about the sake drawer defense
do you know what they say about the sock
drawer defense
which to me looks you know in my
non-lawyer brain looks airtight
to me that looks like the beginning and
the end of the whole conversation
but I'm not a lawyer right and as Alan
dershowitz points out
the the Espionage Act
has to be read in coordination with the
presidential records Act
in other words you can't look at either
of them individually you have to look at
them as a entangled pair
now does your legal experience allow you
to look at those things as a tangled
pair
can you do that
that's a little bit outside of my you
know my sweet spot I mean I I can you
know I can guess what something will
happen with one simple situation sock
drawer yes no I mean I feel like I can
take a guess on that maybe a wrong guess
but I could take a guess but I can't
even take a guess
on an entangled you know
two-part
detailed historical precedence I mean I
don't know how you'd untangle all that
stuff
but
uh here's what the Democrats say about
the sock tour defense
let's talk about something else
would you like to see that that
impression again
right it goes like this uh what do you
think about the Clinton stock drawer
defense
talk about something else
about the obstruction it's the
obstruction
we're not even talking about the soccer
sock drawer what's this got to do with a
sock drawer there's no socks in the
story
foreign
like it wasn't a thing
but but apparently even Jonathan Turley
a famously balanced and wise attorney
once he saw the indictment he said well
there's more more Jeopardy here than I
thought
do you know what the Jeopardy is that
Charlie saw that maybe he didn't see in
the early reporting
the photographs of the mishandling of
the boxes
so he thought that for example the
pictures of the boxes on in a stage area
and in a bathroom
was just
really damning
all right what do we know about the
boxes
Let's uh let's talk about what we know
about the boxes
uh so we know that there was a photo of
boxes in the bathroom right
how many of the confidential documents
were in those specific boxes in the
bathroom
how many
well that's clearly in the indictment
right
well that's not being reported every day
because that's such a big part of the
story the big part of the story is all
those boxes we've got a picture of boxes
so what's in them what's in the
boxes
if you have not told us that those
specific boxes have secrets in them
that's not part of the story
if it turns out that those boxes do have
things that are classified but if you
and I saw them we would laugh because
they're not important
that's a big part of the story
is there anybody who who told you yes
there were boxes in the bathroom and
there was a there was a document in
there but it sort of dated and old and
doesn't matter and the public already
knew it anyway
did you hear that I mean I don't know
what's in the boxes but I know that a
photograph of boxes doesn't put
you in jail
you better do better than that we know
that most of the boxes were personal
items we've been sold on the idea that
every one of those boxes and
secrets in it the entire amount of
Secrets who was it on Newsmax or did
this
give me give me the name of the
the host on Newsmax who showed the
number of documents I think there were
600 Pages or Greg Kelly so Greg Kelly
did the visual persuasion very well by
the way so he showed you one box
and then he showed what it would look
like to have 600 pages of documents in
one box it was this tall
right this doll in one box would be the
total contents of all now if you assume
that some of these secrets were spread
across different boxes because nobody
really was paying attention right there
wasn't any order to it they were just in
different boxes
then how easily could Trump have looked
through all those boxes to give them
back the stuff that they wanted versus
the stuff they knew was his private
stuff
I don't see any scenario where anybody
could get Trump to sit down and look
through his own boxes there were just
too many of them
you know when does Trump sit there and
say all right that document how many
more boxes 500. all right ah
this one um yeah I guess I keep keep
this one what's the next one
there's no there's no way he actually
looked through the boxes and I don't
think that anybody has told us which
boxes had what and they certainly
haven't told us how secret it was
every part of this is sketchy as hell
you don't think there was any part of
the conversation where somebody said
these boxes maybe they need to be locked
up but these other boxes you just put it
in that bathroom because there's nothing
in them important
I feel like somebody probably at least
asked the question do these boxes have
any secrets in them right because I
because I think they didn't they treat
some of the boxes differently
some of them were treated like they
needed to be stored somewhere right but
maybe the storage came after the doj got
involved
so here's what I saw
I saw at least according to the Clinton
soccer president that the president that
President Trump had all he had the legal
access to everything he took with him by
the process of taking it with them
right the process of removing them
turned it personal according to
precedent and therefore that's not the
legal Jeopardy
the legal Jeopardy and totally suggests
this as well is how he handled things
after after the
the records were asked back
now let me put this in context
the thing that Trump did as far as I can
tell with my limited legal knowledge
looked legal to me
because of the precedent
the part that he is in trouble for is
obstructing
the Injustice of them asking for things
that were legally his
now is it justice to ask you to give
somebody to say give me your stuff that
is legally yours is that Justice
or is that
sounds like Injustice to me seems like
the very definition of an injustice is
taking somebody's private property from
them
so Trump is literally
at risk of going to jail
for obstructing Injustice
am I wrong
the thing he obstructed was not Justice
because he believed he owned those
documents and I would say that he's
probably right
but the obstructing was obstructing not
Justice
but Injustice they were trying to take
his stuff
according to him
so he could actually go to jail for
obstructing Injustice
and we're just going to watch that
happen
all right I'm going to say it again
Trump's not going to jail
and not over anything that we've heard
about and so far I mean if if there's
something we don't know about that's
different but
he's not going to jail and when I say
that I don't mean that as a prediction
you understand that right that's not a
prediction it's also a prediction but
I'm just telling you the country's not
going to let him go to jail for this
it's just not going to happen so if
there's anybody you know on the Democrat
side who thinks they can get away with
this
putting them in jail for obstructing
Injustice
you've got a surprise coming I don't
know what that surprise it will look
like but I wouldn't want to be living in
this country when it happens
PJ says Scott is quite the spin doctor
you know you know what people say when
I'm right
stop spinning
you're sviving do you know what people
say when I'm wrong
oh here's why you're wrong and let me
show you the link that proves you wrong
but what do they say when I'm right
about everything that I'm a troll
is that right PJ
so please continue saying those things
you're saying they feel good
all right uh
Twitter account uh Kenneth Kohler the
great who I often recommend you should
be following
uh is one of many people talking about
uh there's some document
that came out uh
about the vaccinations
I think it was was it a Pfizer document
and the alleged story and my take on
this is I don't believe the story all
right so there's something wrong with
the story but I don't know what it is
but I'm not believing this story at all
that there's some document that has that
shows Pfizer shot was like massively
dangerous across all of your organs and
everything from your eyesight to your
guts would fall out and every part of
your body would be damaged and and they
were like you know over a million cases
of this and they knew it before they put
them out and uh and the FDA continues to
criminally label these safe says Conoco
the Great
Etc
now
because I know at least 25 percent of
you are not going to understand what I
say next I'm going to try to be as clear
as possible 75 of you will get it right
away 25 percent of you are going to go
whoa whoa
all right you ready 25 of you get ready
to flip out
see if you can understand this nuance
independent from the question of whether
the vaccinations are safe or unsafe in
other words that's not my topic
I'm not going to tell you that the
vaccinations are safe or unsafe that's
not my topic so would you comment on
that you'll be on the wrong topic
because you're going to comment on that
go ahead Scott says the vaccinations are
safe go ahead
25 of the idiots you just need to get it
out of your system just get it
out of your system by the way I was up
all last night with food poisoning so
I'm not in a good mood
I'm not a good mood at all so all you
 idiots who want to say that what
I say next is supporting the
vaccinations just get it out of your
 system just do it now will you
all right
here's what I'm going to say
I don't believe the study because it's
due on the nose
two on the nose
doesn't mean it's wrong
here's the part the 25 won't understand
they're getting confused already
that I don't know what is true or not
true about vaccines it's just that this
information is just way too on the nose
that's all there's something wrong
there's either some context missing
something
now again
there it is
Club Adams debunked again so all the 25
over there who who fell from the 4chan
hoax about my pandemic opinions
believe that I was pro-vaccination
do you want to admit it is there anybody
here who wants to admit they fell from
the 4chan hoax about my opinions
God admit it
I want to say you admit that that you
actually believe the 4chan hoax
good
all right
um
somebody asked me what I ate
this is a actually is funny
because I did it to myself
so I've been eating super super basic
and clean you know just like no not even
like much in the way of sauces or
anything I'm not even using soy sauce
like I'm just taking it down to a basic
you know butter on a piece of broccoli
and a piece of salmon sort of thing
and yesterday I decided you know things
were going well I want to experiment by
doing a doordash of a local restaurant
and so I picked my favorite local
restaurant
got a meal that was amazing like really
just amazing because you know if you if
you don't eat good food for an extended
period
and then you put something delicious in
your mouth your your head explodes I
don't know if we've ever had that
experience like if you had dental
problems and you couldn't eat for a few
days then you the first thing you put in
your mouth is like oh my God
so so I ordered some food ate it up and
it was all you know highly seasoned
spicy and it just you just ripped my
guts out
so it was a long night anyway
that's enough about that
uh Rasmussen asked this question
and what was the result
that's right 25 percent
do you need to hear the question
[Laughter]
you already know the out the result
because it's always 25 or roughly all
right here's the question
so the question was set up for this from
Rasmussen uh Vivek ramaswamy said on
Twitter quote this is an affront to
every citizen we cannot devolve into a
Banana Republic where the party in power
uses police force to arrest its
political opponents
except for hypocritical for the Doja to
selectively prosecute Trump but not
Biden
so 58 agreed with that 50 percent of
likely voters agreed with that and uh
how many people uh do you think strongly
disagreed
with the idea we should not be arresting
political opponents
yeah 25 is exactly why you guessed
before you even saw the question that's
how smart
the viewers of this live stream are they
know answers before the questions every
time
all right
well California makes it wants to make
it illegal to uh for a parent to refuse
their kids gender choice
now how many parents do you think agree
with that
how many voters how many voters in
California do you think agree that a
parent should not have the right
to suppress their child's idea that
they're a different gender
[Music]
yeah 28 percent uh think it's abusive 28
think it's abusive for parents
to encourage their kids to say with the
gender identification with which they
were born
28 percent
all right um
which means that Californians
overwhelmingly think the parents should
be in control of that decision and yet
the legislation is moving forward
just think about that an overwhelming
majority
don't want this to happen in California
and it looks like they're going to do it
gonna do it anyway
so uh there's your government working
for you
now I suppose the counter argument for
it would look like this
the counter argument would be there is
one there is one situation in which the
majority should be ignored what would
that be
and I'm not talking about National
Defense I'm talking about a state but
within the state there is one situation
in which the will of the people should
be completely ignored even if everybody
has the same information I'm not talking
about lack of information
what would it be
the will of the people should be ignored
when
exactly minority rights are involved
that is the one time that the you want
your leaders to overrule the majority
because I'm not sure what majority of
people would have ever voted for a lot
of things which have made the country
better in terms of minority rights so I
do think minority rights is the one time
where I'll say
all right
maybe maybe the majority isn't the the
best way to go on this one
but this particular minority that we're
talking about is minors
do you treat the minority of
people under 18 the same I mean we have
a pretty large precedent of not treating
children as adults I feel like we could
stick with that so I don't think this is
so much that the minor I don't think
this falls into the protecting
minorities category to me this looks
like uh parents making a cost benefited
you know risk reward analysis and
somebody has to make the decision
somebody makes it does the state make it
or the parents make it or does the child
make it you know having the state make
it seems dumb having the child making
seems dumb
the parents could get it wrong
but they I think they have a you know an
unrestricted or should have an
unrestricted right to make those
decisions
the health of their child I don't see
what's more important than that for a
parental right
all right
um I'm loving that CNN got all mad and
they say it's outrageous and they that
foxes launched a quote Sinister attack
on Biden
uh because they outrageously labeled I
talked about this and I wasn't even sure
it was true uh you you convinced me it
was and now CNN says it's true the fox
really did have a Chiron Fox News uh
labeling by Biden a wannabe dictator who
was uh uh imprisoning his political
Rivals he was trying to arrest his
political Rivals now here's what's funny
about that what's funny about it is it
looked like a parody to me
I don't know who was thinking what I
can't read any Minds so I don't know
what they were thinking when they did it
but to me it looked like a parody
because after years of trump as Hitler
which CNN and MSNBC have been doing you
know with no shame whatsoever he's a
dictator he's an authoritarian he's the
next Mussolini dictator dictator I
thought it was hilarious
when Fox News used their technique
against them that's what I saw I saw
them just using the CNN MSNBC technique
because it was funny
so I'd love to I love to talk to the
producer or get a quote from the
producer who put it up there I think
it's producer who puts the chirons up I
would love to hear did you just think
that was funny like was that a parody
because it was a parody
thumbs up
thumbs up you nailed it
if it wasn't a parody then you know I
think there's a discussion to be had
there with management the management
might not have been too happy about that
but but if he meant it as a joke
it was a really good one
it was like First Rate like I'm so in
favor of that Chiron
but of course it wasn't technically
accurate all right uh Ukraine looks like
it's devolved into a drone War so you
know all that equipment that you and I
paid for it to be sent over to Ukraine
you know we paid for it with our taxes
and all kinds of really good stuff right
lots of really expensive tank-like
vehicles and all kinds of armored things
that sit on the ground
well it turns out that the Russians had
a few more suicide drones than we
thought these Kamikaze Lancet drones and
they're just picking them all off
apparently if you can see them from the
air they're dead and that's pretty much
the whole story and they can see all of
them from there
so it looks like we're going to run into
some kind of a
tie in which both sides have no big
equipment left
because both sides are going to take out
all the big equipment on the other side
as long as neither of them can break
through the lines which looks like it's
kind of stable at the moment they're
just going to be sending you know drones
to and artillery and stuff to pick off
the big assets we're about six months
away
from neither side having any big
military assets
nothing the they'll just be people with
like guns running toward each other it's
going to be medieval there'll be nothing
left now I know what you're going to say
let me say the NPC thing before you did
all right here's the NPC thing there is
always a new weapon to thwart the old
weapon
right
right
somebody jump in say there there's
always a new way you always think you
always think the tank the tank will be
the Ultimate Weapon then there's
anti-tank weapons and you think
airplanes will be the ultimate weapons
but then there's anti-aircraft
none of that applies to drones
the the the thing that's different about
drones is you can make them in in bulk
you make as many as you want it doesn't
matter how good the defense is you can
always make more than the defense could
handle just economically it's always
going to be the better play
so I don't see that there's any any
future in which big pieces of assets win
Wars anymore
I think they'll all just it's just going
to be Kamikaze drones as fast as you can
produce them and they just take out
every tank
and every big piece of equipment
cyber warfare to take control then well
good luck
Maybe
you know I was told that the drones
wouldn't work because of all the
anti-drone technology
what happened to all that anti-drone
technology
yeah I don't think anybody's going to do
an EMP because the EMP
yeah it's I I don't see it
don't see it happening
all right fifth generation Warfare
all right
well
um it's becoming like the religion or
the book I wrote in 20 2004.
in which drones are going to be the only
thing because they'll be so cheap and so
plentiful that there's no technology
that can stop them all so they can get
anything you want Oh Tom Brady in the
football
yeah if we send Tom Brady over there he
can knock down drones with footballs
that could work
all right
ladies and gentlemen
that's all I had today was there any
story I missed anything happening that
matters
um
what stock should you buy for the Drone
boom well it's probably too late for
that
did you hear me supporting Schiff
did anybody hear me supporting Schiff
is that what you heard
that's what you heard
you're being silly don't be silly
I don't think there's anybody I support
less than Schiff
no James James says no no you do support
Chef you do really because I support not
destroying the Republic
that's exactly the same
exactly the same
are you joking
uh hotep Jesus has been on fire lately I
have to catch up with whatever he's
doing there
I am cranky sorry I didn't get any sleep
last night
I'm surprised I got all the way through
this
um
I believe you suggested he could be
charged with a death penalty exactly
I'm still in favor of the death penalty
for Schiff
I think the death penalty is appropriate
for what he did
because that was literally trying to
overthrow a government
if you're trying to overthrow a
government uh
by lying
I don't know looks like a death penalty
situation to me
um oh did I redeem myself because I said
he should be charged with a death
penalty
like you you couldn't handle that Nuance
could you 25 who couldn't handle it
uh the barisma bookkeeper had a
mysterious death according to Giuliani
well I think if you add according to
Giuliani to any statement of fact
we have a problem
am I right
I don't think you're making your point
by adding according to Giuliani that
that's not helping you at all
right
uh
hotep isn't taking prisoners
you had a bad idea on the grand jury and
knowing the racial makeup
but what makes it a bad take
the the worst comment is that's a bad
take
that's a comment you should never make
because you're just wasting everybody's
time
just say what the problem is
you can say what the problem is
you have all these words you can put
them in a sentence and stuff just say
the problem
have I have I ever shied away from
arguing the facts
you could just use facts it's fine don't
be afraid
all right
uh
anything else happening
DMV records what about that
you do want to know how many white women
were on the grand jury
interesting
uh the Hatch Act
I forget which story that was what was
the
oh thanks Kim King Neptune
uh talk stock market
all right let me talk stock market how
are we doing today
up again holy cow
uh
do you mind if I uh
beat myself up for selling my Apple
stock too soon
but everything else looks up so that's
good Ulta Ulta came back after uh
getting after being dumped on for all
the shoplifting
all right here's here's my take on the
stock market
where else are you going to put your
money
I think the stock market is benefiting
from the where else are you going to put
it
if you keep it in cash
inflation eats you up if you put it in
companies in theory the companies can
raise their prices if they need to and
so they should keep up with inflation
over time
so if you try to avoid inflation
you're probably gonna you know keep your
house and not sell it
because your house will inflate and so
you can stick with things that way so
what we have is a lack of alternatives
and I think the lack of Alternatives
supports the
the stock market but I wouldn't I
wouldn't buy anything with a high
multiple
I mean just in general I wouldn't buy
anything with a high multiple
although I have but special cases
what about real estate well there's
supposed to be a
commercial real estate collapse that's
coming
which should affect the banks but for
some reason we talked about it a lot and
then we stopped talking about it I don't
know why
because if it's as big a problem as it
looks we should be only talking about it
like there wouldn't be any other problem
it's the biggest of all big problems if
it takes out the banks but I just wonder
if we know anything about anything
anymore in terms of economics
the experts have done such a bad job of
predicting
that it feels like predicting is just
nonsense now you know how many of you
predicted besides me now by the way can
I get a fact check on this I believe I
was the one of the first there had to be
others but I think I was one of the
first people to say in public that the
economy would not go into a deep
recession
and that if there was one at all it
would be a glancing recession and
probably not one at all right that was I
exactly right
so far I was I would say I had the most
accurate
um there may have been other people who
said the same thing but I didn't hear
them yeah but well before well before we
knew what would happen I said minor
recession or not at all
that's what we got
that's exactly what we got I I of course
like everybody said there would be
inflation
but uh I was a little less certain that
we knew that would end us
I didn't think you would necessarily
take us out
I thought we'd figure out some way to
work through it so far
so far we're working through the
inflation I would say you know it is
dropping slowly but if it's dropping at
all you're probably going to be fine
remember I told you that jobs were the
one thing to watch
the jobs if you get the jobs right
usually everything else can you know
work its way out and adjust but lack of
jobs is just a killer that one you don't
get over too easily
and our job stayed good surprisingly
good and that's probably why we avoided
a recession
so
I would look at my uh
my predictions so here's what I think
about the stock market I think the stock
market will just be an average good
stock market
because things are returning from you
know pandemic levels we're working
through the inflation jobs are staying
good we're repatriating some stuff from
China but you know that's not the
biggest thing that's happening
um
if if you were to look at what's
happening
there's a whole lot of good stuff
happening
yeah a whole lot of good stuff happening
so I would expect that we'll that the
stock market is a reasonably good place
to have money if you're going to keep it
there for five years or more but that's
always the case
if economists could predict anything
they'd be billionaires and some are
some are that's what that's how Soros
made his money by predicting what would
happen next that's how uh Warren Buffett
made his billions
by knowing what would happen
yeah
uh
does that sound like I was supporting
Soros it's a weird day today
uh
I don't know what that's all about
all right video Biden says he will build
railroad across the Indian Ocean what
Biden says he wants to build a railroad
across the Indian Ocean
that can't be real
Is that real
it doesn't sound real
did you watch the jobs so there was some
jobs news today right the jobs
underperformed
is that right
there's some job news today but it
didn't look like it was such a big
change from prediction that I that it
matters
from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian
Ocean what
is he trying to uh he misspoke okay
yeah short-term T bills five percent
sure
I mean if you want your money right away
but for your investing money
I'm not sure you want it there
um
yeah my main Investments are S P 500 and
the QQQ
NASDAQ
it's hard to get a job in app support
now
because of AI
all right
um
give up dude he won't go back claims to
be open to feedback there's probably
just some comments that I didn't see go
by I of course I'm open to feedback
what is it you tried to tell me that I
missed
uh
what's your papa
you meant to say
uh never answered your question
all right well I don't see uh what it is
you were complaining about
all right Daniel pennies
how many of you think Daniel Penny
should have been indicted
is there anybody here who thinks he
should have been indicted
right none of you think this is anything
but a racial outcome right
just racism that's what looks to looks
to me like just racism
which I can say out loud but some of you
cannot
tell you this free speech thing is
working out great for me I'm liking it a
lot
so I understand the the Dilbert reborn
comic didn't didn't publish this morning
on locals but I will fix that as well as
on Twitter
so if you want to see the new Dilbert
comic that is far spicier than anything
you've seen before because it's behind
the paywall you can see it on Twitter
uh if you subscribe to me and you can
see it on the locals platform Scott
adams.locals.com
all right
with inflation Daniel Penny should be at
least a nickel
all right I approve of that Dad joke
by now Daniel penny is worth at least a
nickel
and 50 Cent is worth 10 cents
how about going live on Twitter I don't
even know how you do that
no I don't think Charlie has turned he
just saw a bunch of photographs of boxes
that were alarming
and spaces
what would I do in spaces
just more of this
just once though you see don't just once
don't you want to see the family of of
the deceased say yeah I have to admit he
had it coming
like just once though you want to see
that
like yeah it's a tragedy but honestly
the way he was acting totally understand
now I guess that's hard to do if it's
your own family
uh
all right YouTube I'm gonna say bye for
now I'm gonna see you tomorrow best live
stream you've seen this morning
no doubt about it
