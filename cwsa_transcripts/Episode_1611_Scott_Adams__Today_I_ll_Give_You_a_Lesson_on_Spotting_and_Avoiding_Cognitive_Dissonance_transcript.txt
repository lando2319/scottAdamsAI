middle
but before we do that
how about a little simultaneous sip
anybody anybody up for the simultaneous
step yes of course you are and all you
need is a copper mug or glass attacker
shelves a steiner canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's called the dopamine hit of the day
everybody's saying it and it's all about
the simultaneous sip and it's gonna
happen
right
now
john
john is willing to pay me to watch the
dr malone interview
you're going to pay me to watch the
whole three hour interview
can we get any seconds on that can i
start a gofundme
oh that would be interesting wouldn't it
my god i think we've invented something
here
i think you invented something i'm just
repeating what you invented
how much would you like a gofundme
to force public people to consume
the opposite opinion
or and then talk about it actually put a
show on
huh
that's not a bad idea at all is it
in fact i like i do you ever have an
idea that's so good it makes you get
goosebumps i just got goosebumps
that is such a good idea
isn't isn't there a whole bunch of
problem going on that you're sure
somebody didn't see the other side
because the reason you're begging me not
begging i'm sorry that's a jerk word the
reason you're asking me
and even willing to pay money in some
cases to watch that three-hour interview
is that you think that
combining those two things would cause
something good for the world right
or at least good for your entertainment
which is good for the world too
that's really good because i actually do
think that if you induced me to say read
a book
i would read it
i would actually go for that
now
you know each person is going to have a
different
level of inducement
maybe i'd need that money to go to
charity or something
you know something something to make it
more
fitting for people in my situation but
i would be i would be absolutely
influenced by that
if you if you're wondering if i
personally
would change my behavior if somebody did
a gofundme just to get me to consume
some information they think i need that
would then therefore be useful for the
public i would do that
i would totally do that
great idea
i think we invented something today i'm
going to build on that idea a little bit
as we go but first
have you seen the uh
videos of china publicly humiliating
their citizens
who violated coven restrictions
i swear to god it looks like a scene
from game of thrones
you know with the walk of shame
for many of you have seen it i won't go
into the details but apparently they
make they do a big public event with
lots of military people and then the the
violators of their coveted restrictions
wear all white outfits
and it looks like they make them
put a sign around their neck
with a big photo on it and i don't know
if the photo is a picture of them
or is it a picture of somebody
like that would shame them more than
their own picture i don't know exactly i
couldn't tell from that
is it it's their face
because i think their actual face is
covered with some kind of a
masky situation right
guessing
so
so they need to be able to see their
full face without a mask i guess that's
why they do it
and
how would you like that
process uh and
viva fry was saying this in a tweet is
that better or worse than what canada
does
canada will find you a thousand to six
thousand dollars according to viva
if you violate covent restrictions
which one would you prefer
would you rather pay
let's take an average you know would you
rather pay three or four thousand
dollars
fine
or would you rather
wear a sign around your neck
with your picture on it and be marched
around by the chinese
leaders
i don't know they're both pretty bad i
think i'd pay the money
but your mileage might vary
all right we're going to talk about dr
malone and joe rogan
this will not be comfortable
i promise you it will not be comfortable
are you ready for this
and i'm going to do it in the context of
a lesson
on cognitive dissonance
how to spot it
so you can see it in the wild
but then also how to
maybe
defend against it
now i would say first
i do not have
anything i would call solid evidence
that anybody can defend against
cognitive dissonance
i don't think i can do it
but i think maybe there are some tools
you could use at least have a chance
but i don't know how you would measure
such a thing to know if it was working
or not
now the problem with cognitive
dissonance is if you're the one who's
experiencing it
you're the only one who can't tell
you're the one who can't tell that's the
point
right
so
anytime i'm experiencing it
by definition
there's a good chance that you could see
it in me
but i would argue like a wounded weasel
that i'm not doing that at all
that's what it would look like all right
so if you want to know if i'm in
cognitive dissonance you want to look
for the trigger first
but also and i'll explain the trigger
usually just means that i've done
something usually in public in my case
that would be at odds with who i think i
am
so who i think i am is a person who is
reasonable and rational
but if i were to be called out in public
for doing something the opposite you
know very irrational getting something
really wrong
presumably my self-image would now be
out of whack with what i actually did
and then i would hallucinate that i
didn't actually do anything that bad
oh yeah but you're interpreting that
wrong
so you could see it in me
because i would be
peddling hard to
you know convince you it wasn't
happening but i'd be the only one who
couldn't say it it would be invisible to
me
all right
now here are some suggested ways
to get out of cognitive dissonance or at
least maybe
maybe
and that's the best i can give you on
this topic is maybe it will reduce your
risk
of being in cognitive dissonance
so
i will and then i'm going to tie this to
the malone interview dr malone interview
on joe rogan
and it's all going to come together in
ways that will make you very
uncomfortable
all right
so
here's the best i can offer you for a
defense for yourself
against cognitive dissonance number one
do some do some uh it would only take 15
minutes of your entire life to do some
googling and learning what cognitive
dissonance
and confirmation bias are now i would
argue that five years ago a lot of you
wouldn't know what those words meant
am i right
but in the last five years almost all of
us know what that means
it's a big deal
now i think that um now some of you have
known what they've meant forever right
i understand that but i'd say for maybe
a solid third of the public maybe half
maybe more
they were learning about these things
for the first time
usually under the trump
uh scenario
so first of all know what they are
that's that's the starting point if you
don't know what they are you're never
going to defend against them
number two practice being embarrassed in
front of other people
it's probably the best
advice i could give you if i were wrong
in front of you about something really
big
could i survive it
yeah no problem
no problem
because i've practiced for decades being
criticized being wrong in public
having to deal with it being embarrassed
i've given entire speeches with like
broccoli in my teeth
i mean you name it if it's embarrassing
oh i've done it
there's there's an embarrassing story
that
i desperately want to say tell in public
and and someday i will is something
that's more embarrassing
than anything you any of you have ever
been involved in it was something that
happened to me personally
someday i'll tell you that a story and i
have to tell you that i laughed all the
way through it it was the funniest day
of my life
for most of you it would have been the
most embarrassing thing that has ever
happened to you
someday i'll tell you the story but the
only thing i'm offering is that practice
in anything makes you better at it so if
you can practice being embarrassed
in other words put yourself in a
situation where you're not good at
something
do something you're not good at in front
of other people and do it a lot
watch what happens you just get used to
it
yeah you really do get used to the fact
that other people's opinions are really
just a chemical reaction in the skull of
a stranger
when somebody has a chemical reaction in
their skull
why why should that bother me
because that's all it is
my sense of embarrassment and shame
is a reaction to some chemical reaction
in somebody's skull and i don't even
know them half the time
so don't let embarrassment bother you
that'll give you a defense against
cognitive dissonance
create a track record of admitting
mistakes you don't want to be the person
that they say you never say you're wrong
i am one of those people unfortunately
that one of the most common criticisms i
get is people say you won't admit you're
wrong
well that's true
when i'm right
i don't admit i'm wrong when i'm right
maybe i don't admit it when i'm wrong i
wouldn't know
let's get rid of
ron
for being an
goodbye wrong
now
since i have created a track record in
fact wrote a whole book
about all my mistakes
if i were to add another mistake in
public it would be a small percentage of
all the mistakes i've admitted to in
public
so i'm a little bit unvulnerable and
it's a little bit of protection not
completely
against getting triggered by oh i have
to defend my rightness
i don't feel that as strongly as i used
to
if you asked me when i was 16 years old
do you think you could admit you were
wrong
nope
nope
there's no way that's going to happen
but at my current age
could i admit to you that i was wrong on
something really big yeah i could yeah i
could get past that
so i have a little bit of protection
all right next um
well i'll get let me get to this last
think in terms of the odds
so never think in terms of something is
always true or always false as soon as
you do that you're setting yourself up
to be wrong
if the answer is any of those nuanced
answers
so don't put yourself in the position
where you've said something that can't
be estimated is 100 likely to happen
if it can't be estimated just put some
odds on it and then if you're wrong
you're like well i thought it was a 60
chance it would happen but you know 40
chance it doesn't happen is pretty big
so it's not like i have to explain
anything
so if i say there's a 80 chance of
something happening and then it doesn't
happen
do i get cognitive dissonance
maybe
but there's a less of a chance because i
said there's a 20 chance
it'll go the other way and that's pretty
big
all right recognize the triggers this is
the most important one and this will
dovetail into the conversation about
dr malone on
joe rogan
one of the best ways you can trigger
somebody is by adding nuance into a
conversation where people are taking
only two sides
if the if people imagine there are two
sides and only two sides and you know
these people i call them the binaries
they can't really see anything but the
two sides
and if you do anything that's a nuance
or anything that doesn't conform to
exactly one of the sides
the person who's a binary will say well
you're on the other side
because you didn't agree with everything
i say
so
if you see a situation where
somebody's sense of binary truth is
violated they will be triggered into
cognitive dissonance
and that's what happened with both
uh dr malone who was on the joe rogan
show
and with a tweet that i made about joe
rogan
now in the case of dr malone
dr malone is a nuanced situation
because he's being called an anti-vaxxer
that's what his critics say
at the same time he is vaccinated
he is vaccinated
and
he's an expert who worked to make
vaccinations for other people
he is the most
that's
let me get rid of the absolute in that
sentence
it would be very difficult to make an
argument he's actually anti-vaxx
when he's vaccinated and has worked to
make vaccinations
what he is is someone who has a nuance
he's someone who says vaccination good
in some situations perhaps we should be
more reserved in other situations
that's a nuance it's not provacs or
anti-vex
so that triggers people into cognitive
dissonance in this case it would be the
people who were provacs
so the pro-vax people would be triggered
by the fact that dr malone is a nuanced
opinion
everybody agree so far
you're all with me so far this is the
easy stuff i'm going to get to the more
challenging stuff in a minute
okay
i'm seeing a nope on there but only one
so don't know what that's about
all right
now i tweeted this morning something
about joe rogan which i was quite sure
would trigger cognitive dissonance why
because joe rogan is the ultimate
binary situation
and you're going to recognize this as
soon as i say it
you either think joe rogan is a national
treasure
and i do by the way i think he's a
national treasure
or
you think he's a right-wing
i don't know purveyor of misinformation
seems to me that there are those two
impressions of them
but i tweeted a nuance
in which you can love joe rogan to the
maximum amount
and appreciate his talent stack which is
extraordinary
one of the best talent stacks meaning an
assembly of talents that work together
well
show me a better example
best example of work ethic talent stack
career strategy
and then execution
just about that you've ever seen
so i can't say enough good things about
joe rogan and his show which is why it's
a gigantic phenomenon
but let me give you some nuance
i'll give you an example of a kitten
let's say you had a kitten
it's a tiny little kitten
and you say oh this is so cute and then
the little kitten because it's just a
kitten like claws you a little bit
but it doesn't really hurt because it's
like little kitten claws you just go oh
kitten take that take that hand off of
me you've got like a little dot there
and you don't feel it but it's so cute
it's so cute you don't even mind it's
like it's got nails and stuff you don't
mind it's inconvenient like it's just so
cute
now imagine that your kitten
was the size of a dinosaur
it's still a kitten
but it's the size of a dinosaur
and now it can kill you
does your opinion change
yes
and the only point is that the size of
something completely changes what it is
obviously right
there's a difference between a raindrop
that can't hurt you
and being stranded in the middle of the
ocean
which
probably kill you right
now
let's get to joe rogan
when joe rogan was a smaller show
if he had some misinformation on there
let's say a guest says something that
wasn't true
it doesn't matter not really because
when it's the smallest show it's for
entertainment it's not changing the
world in any way it's just for fun
people say things that aren't true
something to talk about is nothing it's
a kitten
it's just a kitten
then the joe rogan show
turns into the biggest phenomenon in the
world
suddenly it's the kitten that turned
into a dinosaur
is everything the same now
if there's some misinformation
hypothetically
that came out on the joe rogan show
would you say ah it doesn't matter
it's cute it's like a little kitten
take that little kitten paw out of my
hand
no
joe rogan has now surpassed
at least for people who lean right i
think
joe rogan has surpassed the credibility
of the major
news organizations
true or false
true or false joe rogan is not only
gigantic in terms of audience
but has surpassed
by far
the credibility of the major media
publications true i'm seeing all truths
on locals
youtube you got a little delay here
would you agree with that
they're for the right
people lean right and most of my
audience does
but for us
right there's a general agreement that
that he's he's far and away
more credible and one of the reasons
he's more credible and again i'm going
to ask for a fact check on this
would you say that he's more credible
because
he is not intending to mislead you
now we can't read his mind but we see no
evidence
i mean none
that there's any intention
there's anything but positive right 100
agreement 100 agreement i'm saying that
there's no sense
that money could buy him right
do you think money could buy joe rogan
like do you think a pharma company could
say look
i know you're doing well
but i'll give you half a billion dollars
to say our drugs are good when you know
they're not
do you think joe rogan would take it
what do you think half a billion dollars
to lie to you do you think you'd take it
no i mean we don't know right i mean you
know that's the realm of anything's
possible but no no you would not believe
that for a second
because he's doing well and why would he
suddenly turn from
a force of unambiguously good
to like the darkest evil that that
wouldn't happen but would would the news
do that
would any of your news platforms or even
social media would you trust them
to not take
a billion dollars
to say something that wasn't exactly
true or maybe or maybe de-emphasize
something which ends up the same do you
think the major platforms would turn
down a billion dollars
to say something that wasn't exactly the
best thing for the world
don't know i don't know
but i wouldn't say it's the same
standard
like i i would feel really confident
that joe rogan would not take a giant
bribe to lie
i would not be confident even a little
bit
that a corporation wouldn't take money
to shade the truth
so we have this situation
where joe rogan is at least to a large
segment of the world the most credible
person in the game
or among the top
now so far are you with me
everybody
so far
right because this is the setup for the
cognitive dissonance i'm about to
present to you
if all of that's true
and you believe it if i were to say
something that violated
everything that we both agreed is true
what would happen
you would be triggered into cognitive
dissonance
so this is the setup and i'll see if i
can do it right now because i'm going to
read to you a bunch of tells for
cognitive dissonance in a little bit
uh but you're going to see them go by on
the screen too all right here it comes
i'm going to drop the trigger on you
some of you saw this already in twitter
we all agree
or it seems like it based on the
comments it seems like it the joe rogan
is probably the most
useful
source of information we actually have
in the united states
right we all agree with that
now here's the trigger
joe rogan's program is ripping the
country apart it's one of the most
destructive things i've ever seen in my
life
and now i'm going to back it up
it's one of the most destructive things
i've ever seen
and it's completely accidental
has nothing to do with joe rogan doing
anything wrong
okay
what happened was the show got big but
it stayed the same
and there's the potential now
that if and can you deal with me that
this is hypothetical all right
so what what comes next is not a
criticism
it's a hypothetical
what if joe rogan with all of his
credibility
oh here's the first one
i can't tell if this is uh a joke or not
but market trader is coming in with the
first tell he says cognitive dissonance
again scott has jumped the shark oh
actually that's a different comment but
you'll see the cognitive dissonance in a
moment
so here's my argument for why
joe rogan is ripping the country apart
now remember
i'm now between the binaries there's a
binary that he's a force for good and
it's just great and there's a binary
that says he's spreading misinformation
i i just went right in the middle
i said he's one of the best things we
have in the country
complete respect
but
he's also ripping the country apart
accidentally
and here's the problem
when you get somebody with that level of
credibility
and they put one expert on
what if the expert says something that's
wrong
what's the outcome of that
well if you put an expert on a low
credibility show and they said something
wrong maybe no big deal
but what happens if you put somebody
into a three-hour interview
and hypothetically we're not yet talking
about any individual person but
hypothetically what if that person said
something that was harmful to your
health
how big a problem is that
or what if he said something the expert
that was uh would divide the country
um
is scott having a mole in you moment i
don't even know what that means
so
here's why joe rogan is destroying the
country
while at the same time being the one of
the best things we have in the country
it goes like this
when you put one
rogue expert
rogue meaning doesn't agree with the
mainstream of anything
or on some topic anyway
if you put one rogue on you are only
misleading the public
that's the only thing that could come
out of that
because
you need the other side
well
let me soften that if the expert said
only things that were true and good that
would be the best thing in the world can
we agree on that if you were to put an
expert on who only said things that were
true and good and useful
and you put it on the gigantic platform
of joe rogan
boosted by the credibility that his
platform has that would be the best
thing in the world
right
but what if and again this is
hypothetical we're not yet talking about
an individual what if he put on somebody
who said something really dangerous
what's the check and balance against
that
well one check is you could go do your
own research right to see if that expert
was right
does that work
no i always rail against that we think
we can do our own
we think we can do our own research but
we end up just going down a trail of
confirmation bias you know if you do the
research you'll find out that you were
right all along
and if i have the opposite opinion and i
do my own research what am i going to
find
you did your own research and found out
you were right all along
i disagree with you and i do my own
research is there any chance
that i'm going to see the same thing you
saw and then agree with you
no we're both going to do our own
research and come to different
conclusions
that's why doing your own research is is
actually a joke for most of us
i would still say do it
right
you know it's better than
not doing it
but you're going to mislead yourself
a lot of times so be careful about that
when you do your own research so
let me let me
give you this proposition
how many of you would say that hearing
one side of an argument is better than
hearing two sides
nobody right
nobody would say that right
there's nobody
nobody not even i think this is one
thing you could say as an absolute
that you could get away with there would
be no reasonable person
who would say it's better to hear one
side of an argument
than two
who would ever say that nobody
but the joe rogan model
again
didn't matter when it was a small show
but now it's really important when he
shows one point of view
and a lot of the country think
there's a mistake there like a big one
that could matter to people's health
that's a problem
that is a big big problem and that's
where we are right now
and let's talk about dr malone and what
he may have gotten right
and what he may have gotten wrong
one of the things i hear from his
supporters and defenders
is that um he's an expert and he has
lots of expertise and show we should
mention
so i was i did listen to the first i
don't know 45 minutes or an hour of the
joe rogan show i'll watch the rest of it
you don't have to pay me
so i do plan to finish it
but i have enough now that i can i can
make my point
so the doctor was asked and i love i
love this technique by the way instead
of joe rogan introducing somebody uh and
i use the same technique i asked them to
introduce themselves because they'll
tell you the things you need to know for
the topic
so when dr malone has asked for his uh
expertise
have you heard the list of his expertise
it's pretty damn impressive
right i mean he just goes on and on
about you know the trials he's run and
the different degrees he's gotten and
the the things he's worked on and oh my
god
it's really impressive so we can all
agree on that right that is
uh that that's all impressive
but what are the two things that he is
uh
he is most being talked about
i would say the two things that have
come out of the interview and since i
haven't watched the three hours i don't
know how much is buried there but in
terms of the things that emerged out of
it as the clips or the highlights
i would say two categories have emerged
one is why did he get kicked off of
twitter
so he got booted off of twitter
and when asked which tweet joe of course
asked the the smart question
which tweet or tweets got you kicked off
twitter
do you know what dr
malone said
he didn't know
he didn't know now i think that could be
true because i think twitter doesn't
tell you specifically
but
other people know
other people believe
that he got kicked off the twitter
not for something that happened within
his expertise
but when he left his expertise
and did a data analysis
because he may have been analyzing
something that was within his expertise
but data analysis i don't believe
was part of his stated expertise
so when he left his expertise
to say that this study is a good one or
a bad one
other people that i rely on to tell me
if a study is good or bad said no that's
a bad study
so you have the people who are actual
experts at knowing whether a study looks
legitimate just by even what they tell
you about it
the people who are actually experts
and i don't have an indication that dr
malone is an expert on data analysis but
if but if he is let me know i would
change my opinion if that's true
um but the people like say
say andres backhouse i use him as my
example a lot when he looks at some of
the things that come out of some of the
rogue doctors he may have a different
opinion so
twitter
presumably and i get we need to learn
more about twitter presumably banned him
because
he he mentioned a study or a fact
that other people say
you're reading it wrong
okay so the whole twitter got kicked off
is something outside of his expertise
who would disagree with that
is the good doctor also an expert beyond
beyond being an expert on the topic
so i'm agreeing he's an expert on the
topic
only data analysis as a field
i'm saying he didn't claim expertise
right
and and andres backhoes could be wrong
as well that's correct
so we're getting to the point where if
you if you don't have two experts
you don't have much of anything then the
second thing he talked about that's
getting a lot of attention trending on
twitter is mass formation psychosis
and he quotes uh he quotes some experts
on that now
did dr
malone say that he was an expert in this
field the mass
formation psychosis
i don't believe he made that claim right
can you fact check me
i don't think there's any claim like
that
so
you have the good doctor
who within his area of expertise
as far as i know i don't have anything
to disagree with him about
does anybody have an example because
you've seen more of it
but i'm not familiar with anything he
said
within his expertise
that i disagree with has anybody seen
any example of that if you know my
opinions as his
i don't think we disagree
now he hasn't made some speculation
about why he got kicked off the twitter
and although he doesn't have a a
specific theory about why it happened
he speculates that it might not be about
just the accuracy of his information
could be maybe
political
what do you think
do you think that it's political
why he's being taken off
it's a good argument right i think you
could argue that it looks political
now whether or not it's right or wrong
can be a separate argument from whether
the reason he's being taken off is
political i think we'd agree on that
right
so
those who say and i think joe rogan and
dr malone would agree that free speech
has to trump
accuracy
would you agree
that free speech as a standard has got
to be more important
than accuracy because we all get stuff
wrong
you want you want to you want a
situation where free speech fixes the
inaccuracies
right so you're free to say something is
wrong
other people are free to correct you
self-correcting system
so can we all agree
that free speech
as a standard needs to be higher and
more important than accuracy
i think i could get 100 agreement on
that
now how many of you would agree
that there are limits to free speech
now i use the example on twitter of
yelling fire in the theater and i guess
there's some history of that that makes
that a bad example
but
can you say things that are
uh
clearly untrue
that would get the public
uh damaged
for example
do you have the do you have the freedom
of speech
to say um
you can cure your covet by
drinking
poison
do you have that freedom of speech
actually i don't know that's not even a
rhetorical question
do i do i have the freedom of speech
let's say i'm an expert
to make it worse right let's say i'm an
expert and i say you know you should all
just go
drink poison
because that'll cure your covid but
you'll still be alive of course which is
not true
do i have the freedom of speech to do
that
the the bleach thing never happened
it got a little complicated right the
most people were answering whether yes
or no were saying yes
yeah i do have that
i do have that freedom
but
should the social media companies
who are not exactly bound by
the freedom of speech second amendment
because that applies to the government
not the private companies does a private
corporation
have an obligation
to use their best judgment
to get rid of something that's so
dangerous
that
lots of people would die from it
does the social media platform have that
obligation
they certainly have the power
and they certainly have the right
you'd agree with that right they have
the power because they do it
and they have the right
because they're not a government
organization
so they have both the power and the
right to do it
should they
so suppose
let's make it a little tougher for you
so you could argue whether somebody's
specific information was good or bad for
the public
but let me let me make it harder for you
suppose you knew for sure
that the information would kill people
and there would be no upside
what if you knew for sure
what would you do then
your your twitter
and you see some information and it
comes from a top expert
and let's say this is a hypothetical
because nobody could know for sure i
think we can agree right nobody's that
sure but let's say hypothetically you
did know for sure
it would kill people and a lot of them
what do you do
what would you do
let me ask you you're the you're the
ceo of twitter
and there's some information you could
block
or you could allow if you allow it
you're sure because this is a
hypothetical you're sure a million
people will die
what do you do you're ceo of twitter go
kill the million or save the million
you don't get to not answer this
question
yeah you got really quiet on that
question didn't you
yes or no do you kill the people or do
you let them go
a lot of you would some would say save
some would kill them
all right so the i appreciate that there
there are free speech absolutists who
say they would let a million people
innocent people die
to preserve free speech
now you can agree with that or disagree
with it but that's at least a credible
opinion right i mean there's plenty of
room to disagree
but that is a fair opinion
because
i always appreciate anybody who can say
here's my costs
here's the benefits
and i chose you know i chose one side
so the people who say yeah i'd let a
million people die
to preserve free speech
i
i respect that opinion i disagree but i
respect the opinion
because you showed your work
good for you
and you and you stood behind it
good for you i don't believe you by the
way
i don't think a single one of you would
make that choice if you were actually
ceo but
for our purposes today it's a perfectly
reasonable thing to say i just disagree
i think if any of us were in that
position
we you'd save the million people
i think you say you wouldn't and i
totally respect why you say that totally
respect that
but i don't believe it
no way to know but i don't believe it
so
here's uh the situation
i believe that dr malone has
presented information which is
obviously misleading
and dangerous
that's what twitter would say when it
kicked them off now you could argue that
but do you argue that twitter has the
right
and the responsibility
and that aren't you glad you didn't have
to make the decision
now a lot of people are saying to me
scott are you defending google and
twitter
no that's cognitive dissonance
i'm just walking you through it
you make your own decision what's good
or bad
i'm not even sure i have an opinion
what's good or bad
but you got to at least look at it right
um
all right so
there have been claims made
that there are specific tweets from dr
malone that are uh dangerously
misleading
and that's why twitter abandoned when
joe rogan asked him what those were
he said he wasn't sure do you believe
him
do you believe that dr malone doesn't
know
which of his tweets got him banned from
twitter
do you believe he doesn't know
i'm saying mostly yeses on locals
about you youtube do you believe he
doesn't yeah he literally doesn't know
which ones were the problems because
remember
he got lots of replies so he knows which
ones had the factual
problem right
so
i'm going to call on that
i would say that when
dr malone says he doesn't know which
ones did it that might be technically
true meaning he doesn't have a
confirmation
but he knows
i would know
you would know
do you think that you wouldn't know
which one of your tweets got you kicked
off you would know
yeah no i can't read his mind right
whoever said your mind reading
absolutely right that's a good comment
can't read his mind
but
you don't think he's aware
of which factual data
he got the pushback from at exactly the
time that twitter abandoned
i don't think there would be anything he
would have heard of more
than which of those tweets he got banned
for
he knows
now it is i i think i'm gonna i'm not
gonna call him a liar
because when he says he doesn't now i
think that's technically true
you know what i'm saying
if twitter hasn't confirmed it that's
true he doesn't know
but he knows
he knows
anybody in that situation would know you
could not know
how could you not know oh here's one
there we go
boom boom
uh so here's i'm going to be calling out
all the tells for cognitive dissonance
here's one i've been waiting for keep
digging a hole for yourself
so that one and uh accept the l
those are cognitive dissonance and it
has nothing to do with agreeing or
disagree with me it's just the
discomfort that i've i've shown you that
it's not a binary and people are just
floating around
trying to figure out what to do now that
they're confused
all right
i have no idea
what information dr malone
put out there that was the problem
i have seen things he's put out there
that were debunked in a way that i
thought were just really obviously
debunked
but i could be wrong about the debunk
so here's the question
and the and i guess the request
here's a request
to joe rogan
in his current model which just you know
evolved from the kitten to the the
dinosaur
his current model is damaging to the
country it's seriously damaging very
damaging the the interview with dr
mccullough i think was pure damage
to the country pure damage
and i think the uh dr malone interview
is pure damage
pure damage because it lacks the
counterpoint
now
if i told you that you know it's always
darkest darkest before the dawn and we
can't tell the difference between you
know good news and bad news
joe rogan
is this close all he has to do is add a
second person
ideally
a third and fourth person who are silent
members to just fact check things you
know and maybe give a note to the person
as they're going so maybe a couple of
silent fact checkers but joe rogan is
one invitation
meaning the person on the other side of
the argument one invitation away
from ruling the whole world
joe
if you listen into this or anybody
describes it to you
you're so close
take it
there's this big golden ring that's
dangling right in front of you
and maybe you have so many golden rings
already that you can't see this one
but the public is begging you joe
or begging you
please
please
bring on the other side
because nobody's listening to anybody
else we don't trust anybody we don't
trust the news on the left we don't
trust the news on the right sometimes if
it doesn't agree with us we don't trust
social media
but we do trust
joe rogan
am i wrong
so close
just invite the other side
oh my god
i don't know how to unders well i don't
think i can overstate this
rogan is so close
to the model that saves the whole
 world
and it's killing me
that that that it doesn't go there
so close
so he's not only in my opinion a you
know a national treasure
but he is on right on the edge
of running the whole country
indirectly because
if you if you imagined what public
opinion would do
if you saw both sides on his show at the
size of his platform and you knew
that joe himself
is not trying to screw you
when was the last time you saw a
moderator for a debate
that you didn't worry was trying to
fix the debate by the questions they
asked
right you always think that but you
wouldn't think that with him because we
have enough track record you know he's
actually just trying to figure out what
the hell is going on
somebody says that the other side will
not show up uh absolutely not no let me
ask you this
you uh dr malone is called um by some i
think he calls himself that an inventor
of the mrna technology
an inventor of the mrna technology now
he acknowledges
and his critics have pointed out that
there are a lot of people who had
let's say discoveries or contributions
to the platform and he apparently used
one of the important ones
have you heard from the other ones
i'll just let there i'll just let that
sit there for a while
so you've heard a lot from dr malone
he's trending he's all over the news
he's on joe rogans we've heard a lot
from one of
the mrna inventors
what did the other one say
do they agree with him
are you worried that you haven't heard
it
is there even one other person who
agrees with him who is also as qualified
and as that close
to the mrna technology
did you once ask yourself
where have i heard the other experts who
work directly with him
and have either the same opinion or a
different one
yeah it's a good question
and you should be embarrassed
that if it's the first time you thought
of it
that you heard it here
that should embarrass you you should say
to yourself uh there's one group of
people
that we should be hearing from
all of the other people with this same
expertise
none i've heard of none have you i've
heard of exactly zero people now some of
you suspect
and and i'm not going to discount this
some of you suspect that the other side
won't go on
because they'd be embarrassed of their
point of view or they can't defend it
maybe
but wouldn't you like to hear joe rogan
say i put out you know 15 invitations to
this group of people and they refuse to
come on and talk about it
first of all whoever refused an
appearance on joe rogan's show
do you think anybody ever has i mean
sure i'm sure somebody has for some
reason but
well i i've been on his show so i didn't
refuse it
um
dr malone has fu money he does have some
money
so
here's my bottom line if you think that
dr malone is a big ol expert and
everything he says should be taken
seriously i agree with you
as long as he's in this area of
expertise
when he goes into my area of expertise
it looks silly
because i would say that his views on
mass formation psychosis are actually
simplistic
simplistic to the point of being
misleading
here's my take on it
we did not enter a mass formation
psychosis because of the pandemic
we're always in one
and somebody said scott
if we're always in one of these mass
formation psychosis where was the last
one
hahaha if we're always in one how come
we're only having this experience of
everybody like hallucinating and being
weird when we're in a pandemic give me
one other explanation or one other
recent scenario scott since you say this
is all over all the time give me any
other example of a mass
formation psychosis go go scott see if
you can do that
to which i say
have you heard of trump derangement
syndrome
you we all live through it right
that's a mass
formation psychosis
did we need a virus to get there
nope
we were already there
you want another one
climate change
i'm seeing somebody suggest that 9-1-1
was a mass formation psychosis oh i
accept that
i will accept that that's a little more
complicated
but i think there's enough of that
yes
so
uh have i in uh let's say 60 seconds
with my understanding of the topic you
know psychology hypnosis
etc have i debunked
the the doctor's point of view by
showing to you that it adds nothing to
the conversation
we are always in this state
now we weren't always always in as much
of a dangerous state of this because
communication is so much better
everything's faster and bigger and
ramped up
and of course the business model of the
news and social media gets us all
clicking on whatever makes our blood
boil
so this was always a possibility but in
our modern times because of the
social media and the news model etc this
is now permanent
i would argue that when germany was the
example it was an exception
how many of you will accept my
interpretation
that germany was an exception
because during those times
they didn't have good communication etc
it would be a little bit harder for one
of these to form
but today it forms instantly on every
topic
because we go binary on everything so as
soon as you go binary you've lost all
reason
so this is a permanent situation and dr
malone
is famous for this
and clearly
over interpreting it i won't say wrong
because i agree that this is a thing it
just doesn't it isn't relevant to the
current topic
because it's just always here
and data analysis i would look to people
who are better at data analysis than i
am
but also better than he is
and they say
you have some real trouble with some of
the things that you've forwarded
now
what happens when you tell people who
think that joe rogan is the answer to
everything
that he's destroying a civilization with
these one expert interviews do you think
that people will say
well that's a good point
now you got me there
that is a good point
probably not so let me read some of the
uh comments and i'll use these
i'm watching my my follower account on
uh
on twitter it's dropping by hundreds
every minute
i think we're down like
1500 since since i woke up this morning
so so this is what happens when you
you talk like i do
if if you don't stay on one of the
binaries the people who live on a binary
are like i'm out of here
you are not my binary with me all right
so let me tell you the tweet and then
i'll tell you some uh
cognitive dissonance here
all right i said this i said stop
watching long interviews that involve
not one non-expert
talking to one expert that's a guarantee
you will be misinformed
and then just to you know ramp up the
cognitive dissonance i said ask yourself
if twitter or google would ban content
in which opposing sides are argued by
the experts
do you think they would
if joe rogan had uh or let's say if dr
malone's tweet
had been a tweet about two experts who
disagreed and one of them was dr malone
and one of them was the other expert do
you think twitter would abandon that
do you think google would abandon that
you're saying yes but you're lying
because you know they wouldn't
come on you know they wouldn't
no
you you need to give me an example of
that if you can show me an example of
two experts who both get their point of
view out
and you show me that that got banned
then i'll believe you
i i'm gonna i'm gonna stake a claim here
my claim is if both thought if both
sides are shown
fairly
that it would not be banned because that
would just be
useful
right
all right so
anytime one person gets banned that's
not my argument my argument is anytime
that both arguments are shown you won't
get banned so if you're worried about
freedom of speech
are you are you as worried knowing that
if both sides are shown they would keep
it i know some of you doubt that but
don't doubt that
right
because i can't can't believe that they
could defend that in any way
you could certainly defend
that somebody had misinformation am i
right
twitter could be right or wrong about it
but they can defend the notion
that misinformation if it looks damaging
should be removed
right you could argue against it for
free speech but they could defend it
they would have an argument whether you
liked it or not
so all right having said this
provocative thing that you should stop
watching long
interviews
anybody who thought they learned
something valuable from the joe rogan
interview would if they are a binary say
no no no scott
so let me show you some of the comments
i got to that
here's one
benjamin says
this assumes that twitter and google are
playing in good faith and not simply
banning content they don't like nope
nope
i'm not making any assumptions so this
is a hallucination of an assumption if
somebody hallucinates your point of view
it's probably cognitive distance
scott saying we're always in does not
discredit yes okay here's another
example of cognitive dissonance so marv
says in all caps scott
saying we're always in a
one of these
mass formation psychosis
does absolutely nothing to discredit
what malone is saying
it discredited
this
what do you mean it doesn't discredit it
i just discredited it
were you watching
what do you mean it doesn't discredit it
i just told you it's nonsense and i told
you why and you agreed with me
stop yelling caps at me and agreeing
so the other thing that happens is
people would get really mad at me
while agreeing
so here's somebody who says
bow tie reptilian says
so stop watching your live periscopes
what did i tell you about these so
tell for cognitive dissonance
did i did i say anything that would
suggest somebody should watch
my live
podcast
am i an example of a host talking to one
expert for three hours
no
this is cognitive dissonance all right
here's another one
um somebody says
isn't this what happens every time fauci
says anything publicly in other words
the argument is
why would i complain about joe rogan
talking to one expert
when isn't that exactly the same thing
that fauci says
when when nobody's challenging him he's
just talking public
what do you think of that criticism
is that criticism valid good point i see
somebody saying
who else thinks this is a valid
criticism
okay i'm tricking you here you're
falling into the trap
i'm seeing people say yes it's a valid
criticism
no it's not
this is agreeing with me
i said
don't listen to one expert
without the counterpoint
the criticism is well isn't that what
happens every time fauci says anything
publicly
yes
this agrees with me
but people are agreeing with me as if
they're disagreeing with me and there's
a whole bunch of examples of this
um
for 99
sean asked this question
i've asked the same question maybe the
others stand to gain financially so
crickets
sanjay
gupta interviews interviews or a
disaster yes
we i think we're all aware that um
people may have financial interests
in the case of the pharma pharma stuff
all right let's see some other cognitive
dissonance
and there's just weird things i don't
understand
okay
let's see
somebody just says it's a lousy strategy
and my reading comprehension is just
fine so there's a bunch of people who
just insult me personally with no
comment a web whether the idea is good
or bad
[Music]
scott comes down against bill gates
interviews finally
again this is somebody who's arguing as
if i'm not agreeing with him do i think
that you should
you should agree with everything that
bill gates says
without having an expert next to him
i've never said that
you should also doubt what bill gates
says yes that is exactly agreeing with
me
as if you don't agree um
let's see
the problem is that this would only be
useful to an expert audience
really
you think two experts talking would only
be useful to an expert audience if joe
rogan were the host
you don't think joe rogan would force
them to speak in common language so
everybody understood it of course he
would it's what he does
that's why he's joe rogan
that's why he's joking and you're not
because that's what he does
he makes people talk in a way you can
understand them
joseph is just here for the ratio so
he's pretty sure that what i've said is
dumb
[Music]
here vaping rock says except no expert
quote expert is willing to debate dr
malone
really
you don't think i could find a data
analysis expert
who would say that that tweet that
probably got you kicked off of twitter
is wrong and here are three reasons why
you don't think we could find a data
analysis expert
i think you could
i think you could
somebody says it's a risk of being
misinformed but far from a guarantee is
closer to a guarantee now i'll
acknowledge that this is an opinion so
it's not i can't debunk an opinion
but i think the risk in these three-hour
interviews since we've watched quite a
bit of them
i think the risk is is closer to a
guarantee of being misinformed and part
of the reason is that what makes a guest
interesting
is they're a rogue they're saying
something that the others don't say
so i think if you're selecting from the
field of people who say
non-mainstream things and you let them
talk alone for three hours
i think that is always going to be
closer to misinformation than useful
not 100 percent
but maybe
80 percent of the time it would be a bad
idea
and twenty percent of the time it would
be just tremendous
something like that
here's here's the other one just take
the l scott now what would i take the l
for
is it because somebody disagrees that
hearing both sides of an argument is
good
no nobody disagrees with that so here's
somebody who's sure i'm taking the l
will not disagree with anything
um
let's see
some more um
all these comments are just weird
comments all over the board
where can one find such content well
it's a problem it doesn't exist
oh here's somebody saying rogan envy is
a thing
so that my reason for saying that having
one expert instead of both sides is that
i have joe rogan envy
does that sound like a an insightful
comment
let me ask you this
who doesn't have joe rogan envy
if you don't have a little bit of joe
rogan envy
maybe you're not familiar with his
content
um
addison says are you an expert in
persuasion and if you had ever had
another
persuasion expert on your show
i don't think any persuasion experts
would disagree with me
so that would be a weird a weird case
where
i understand what you're asking but
you'd have to have at least the
suggestion of disagreement there would
have to be some reason i think somebody
would disagree i'm not aware of anything
i've said that a persuasion expert would
disagree with
but
let's say there's a situation where on
twitter there's a persuasion expert
who disagrees with me on something
specific that would be a good idea
in fact i'd like that
maybe i could learn something but in
most cases if a persuasion expert
disagreed with me they could cover the
entire thing with a tweet
right so if a persuasion expert
disagrees here's the whole argument
you said x
here's a study that says maybe it would
go the other way
you don't really need three hours for
that
all right
but that was a good question
all right how about
just lots of side comments they act like
they're disagreeing that's not
patrick says what if i listen critically
well that's better than not but it's not
going to get you listening critically
won't tell you what you weren't told
that's what you need the other expert
for
you don't know what's left out
when an expert's talking unless it's
obvious
so that's why you need somebody who
knows what's left out
and
uh just uh go f myself okay
uh every interview every expert in the
history of ever then
i'm being asked as if that's criticizing
my point
no that's agreeing with my point that
the way we've always done it is always
wrong and it will never be right no
matter how long you do it
um
here's here's another so tell this one
says so basically don't listen to an
interview with an expert because you'll
be misinformed
now
did i say that did i say you shouldn't
listen
well i did but in the sense that you
shouldn't take it too seriously
only two or more experts to be properly
informed yeah i would say that that
that is roughly my suggestion
and then he ends with do you see how
ridiculous this sounds
no
no i don't see how ridiculous this
sounds
let me read it again he goes so
basically don't listen to an interview
with an expert because you'll be
misinformed
only two or more experts to be properly
informed yes that's an exact
that is exactly my opinion and they says
do you see how ridiculous this sounds
to which i say no
anything else
oh and then
then he goes on to say i guess all of my
college lectures were misinformation
courses then oh okay i see where he's
gone
so here's the uh
here's the uh clarification
if it's a mature topic
then one expert is fine because in a
mature topic you don't really have
disagreement
so for example if your math teacher
teaches you how to add
do you need the other expert to tell you
that that's wrong
no because it's a mature topic and
there's no there's no disagreement
but on a new topic
professor dunlevy i would say on a new
topic where it's obvious there could be
or is disagreement that's when you need
the other expert okay
you don't need a second expert when
there's no disagreement to be had
what about the flat earth you say
special cases are just special cases
all right um
and then
all right well if you want to if you
want to read lots more uh examples of
cognitive dissonance
you can do that
um
so
have i made my point
that joe rogan can be both a national
treasure
but because of his size and the one one
expert model
that he is super destructive at the
moment
with just with that specific thing
thank you
so people stay still saying no now i
won't disagree
that having one expert on
could be better than none
if it's a new point of view because you
at least you can see the counterpoints
in other places etc but it's a it's a
terribly risky thing to do
yeah it's super destructive because
right now it is changing people's
opinion about vaccinating or how they
should approach the pandemic
and if people are making real life life
and death decisions and they are
you want the other side because it's
controversial if it were not
controversial
let me say this if joe rogan had an
expert on that says hey we should be
paying more attention to fitness
and health
do you think that i would say oh joe i'd
like to hear the other side of that
i'd like to hear the person who says you
shouldn't pay attention to fitness and
health no
no
because there's no debate
it's only when there's a debate
now years ago when i used to do
something called the dilbert newsletter
i don't do that anymore
i came up with a acronym
called bach tau that's how you'd
pronounce the letters
and it stands for
but of course there are obvious
exceptions
and i've often said that the the reason
that most people disagree with me is
that they forget the bach tau is always
implied
but of course there are obvious
exceptions should apply to everything i
say all the time
so when the professor said oh so you're
saying that my lectures
are not good
the actual reply to that is
but
of course there are obvious exceptions
and a lecture would be one because
there's no counterpoint to it
um
scott is it only is it okay to listen to
me for entertainment and not any
knowledge yes it is
now
for those of you who have been saying
that i should just take the l
can you explain that in a way that
doesn't sound exactly like cognitive
dissonance
can you explain to me what exactly the l
is that i would be taking
what what exactly
am i losing specifically
like like what have i said
uh
so donnie is questioning the one expert
thing
am i am i passing myself off as an
expert except
on the one topic that we talked about
that's cognitive dissonance my friend
um kenny says you just got the vaccine
and you regret it just admit it
i don't regret it
and that's the mind reading tell for
cognitive dissonance anybody else
you're not an expert on it
yes i am
i'm an expert on
um persuasion
and this would be a subset
a pretty easy to understand subset in
fact
mass formation psychosis would be like
information 101 for somebody who studied
persuasion this would be
let's say if you were a physics
person this would be like you know the
most basic equation or something
is something that anybody would know is
applicable or not
you should go debate sam harris untrust
the experts i'll bet we wouldn't
disagree
about we wouldn't disagree
i don't think sam harris would disagree
with
one thing i've said today
i mean i don't know
but do let me ask you do you think sam
harris would disagree with anything i
said on today's show
i don't think so
uh please interview with joe rogan again
um i think you need a reason
you know when i when i interviewed with
joe rogan was because i was in the news
for
having a contrarian view on on trump i
think
but and that's why dr malone is on there
and dr mccullough so i don't really have
a contrarian view that has much depth i
mean i don't i don't have three hours of
contrarian view
my entire thing could be let's hear the
other side and we'd be done
um
uh
you can't simply
misrepresent professor desmond's work
and then discuss the disfigured result
well um here's a challenge for you
my claim is that
mass formation psychosis
is such a simple topic for someone who's
familiar with persuasion
that it's easy to understand
and that all of the components of it
i've heard
and i say oh yeah that's obvious when
people are confused for example they
look for new information when when
people don't feel connected to other
people they're a little bit more
confused that's all just obvious stuff
there's nothing about mass formation
psychosis
that is interesting
somebody says study it don't hide
you know i have right
i have read about it
and it doesn't take more than a minute
for somebody who's familiar with the
field
to read it and say oh that's stuff i
already knew
do you get that
that is the most basic thing in the
field
that people who are confused will accept
certainty
when it's offered in some confident form
and that there are things which cause
people to be in an uncertain state
so they're far more likely to be
accepting you know a strong voice is
there any part about that i got wrong
[Laughter]
right
it's kind of it's kind of simple
it's where religion sprouts from correct
all right
um that's all i got for now and i'll
talk to you tomorrow i'm expecting lots
more uh tells of cognitive dissonance in
my twitter feed
uh let's see how far my
uh follower account has dropped since we
started
it's kind of funny the the people who
can't hang with
um
nuance
i'd like to get rid of them yeah we lost
another 100 i think i can't tell i don't
remember what it was but we're dropping
fast
all right i'll talk to you
tomorrow
