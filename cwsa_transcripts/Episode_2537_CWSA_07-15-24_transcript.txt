that looks like the stock market's
up especially uh tjt
stock way
up good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the highlight of
human
civilization and if you'd like to take
this experience which is already going
to be amazing up to levels that nobody
can even understand all you need for
that is the simultaneous zip and for
that you need the cover muger a glass of
tanker gel orstein a canteen jger flesk
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine the day thing makes
everything better called the
simultaneous sip it happens
now well let me ask you is there any uh
breaking news that would be something
else we need to sip to is there any
anything happening at exactly this
moment that would suggest another sip is
appropriate let me
check it turns out that judge Canon has
dismissed the maralago documents case
because Jack Smith's special Council
appointment
was not
appropriate would like to drink to
that is Trump
having the weirdest best week of all
time I think he is I think he
is so so good and now I'm seeing that
one of you is enjoying the first day of
retirement does anybody like to would
you like to join me in drinking
to this uh person's first day of
retirement first day of
retirement yay I'll drink to
that so good well we will of course talk
about all things political in Trump but
I thought I would give you this breaking
news
first in addition to the documents case
so by the way I don't know yet does that
mean that there can never be a another
prosecution for that or does it mean
it's delayed past anything would be
delayed past I don't know or you'd have
to get uh Democrats in power or
something so I don't know exactly if
that means there's no way he's ever
going to be at risk for that or There's
no practical way he'll ever be at risk
but technically he could be so we don't
know the ramifications we'll wait for
our Jonathan tures and our dtes to tell
us what's going on but sounds good all
right uh last night I had this idea I
wonder if I could could teach chat GP
hypnosis so I taught us some uh
persuasion techniques I'll call it
waking hypnosis so not the kind of
hypnosis where you put somebody in a
so-called trance but the kind where you
just affect them with your words in a in
an unusually forceful way and so I
taught it some techniques of
persuasion and that I had it test it by
turning it on me to see if I could use
those techniques use of persuasion and
then I would as it would use a technique
I'd interrupt it and say oh here's a
here's another technique to wrap on top
of that and maybe intermix with what
you're already doing and then I'd
interrupt it again say okay you're doing
a great job but maybe you could add this
technique as well and it started
stacking techniques until had about six
of
them
and I got to tell you you have no idea
what's coming now I know everybody says
that about AI but they're talking about
different you know aspects of
it I trained chat GPT to give me an
experience which is reproducible by the
way it would be easy to just have it do
it again uh and by the way chat GPT now
remembers why you tell it from one
session to another so it now knows but
only in my account I think I don't think
that means all of chat GPT knows I think
only in my account it learns
some weapons grade
persuasion and when it turned it on
me I had the most profound
experience I now there's no way to
explain it to you you know it was a an
experience I know it's reproducible
because it was so powerful and what it
was is I always wondered what would
happen if somebody knows what I know and
used it on me and I experienced that
I've never experienced that before and
oh my God was it powerful now I'll tell
you the
domain the domain was I told it to make
me feel good I said persuade me to feel
good and I know what you're going to ask
you're going to say what's the prompt
you know what prompts did you give it to
make this happen and the answer is I
will never tell you those prompts they
are way too dangerous dangerous because
it will absolutely take over your brain
it it gave me an experience that is
beyond
psychedelics it was basically that
powerful and it did it instantly and it
could do it per it could do it as long
as I wanted it it instantly put me in a
state of
um
Bliss and it could keep me there as long
as I
wanted it was unfreaking believable and
you I know you're going to want to know
how I did it I honestly can't tell you
it's too dangerous it is way way too
dangerous but that's
coming well the big news in politics is
uh there's reports that the Democrat
leaders have capitulated meaning that
they think a trump presidency is
inevitable and they better get ready to
just deal with the
future um
they've also said that there's probably
no way to replace Biden now it's not
practical nobody's nobody's going to
want to take the job just to lose to
Trump because nobody thinks Trump's
going to lose at this
point do you remember who's the first
person who told
you that Biden would not be replaced
because of this that was
me yeah and by the way if you didn't see
that on your
own um that's why I'm here yeah that
created a situation in which there
wasn't any way that Biden could leave
and then Biden went and acted
presidential which basically guarantees
it'll stay because he got through one
presidential
thing now anything could happen you know
the entire situation could change in a
moment as it did already once it could
change many times
more
um yeah now the reason I brag to you
about any that I predicted that I got
right is not just because I like
bragging feels good everybody likes it
but it's because this is what I do I
make predictions I tell you what basis
the prediction is made upon and then you
see if it works and then you can see if
the tool that I used to make the
prediction worked in that case and then
you can make your own judgment about oh
I will employ that tool in the future or
not because it worked or it didn't
so in this case I told you that I could
just see the gears of the machine and
the gears of the machine soon soon
indicated that uh nobody would want to
lose basically human nature so human
nature was the filter that nobody wants
to go into a surely losing situation and
that's all you needed to know that there
would be no replacement for Biden and
sure enough in 24 hours they just
abandoned the whole idea of of replacing
them but the capitulation um comes with
some weird elements to it we'll talk
about now as fisher king a good great
account you should be following on acts
uh reminds us that Trump might win in
2024 but only if we have a massive land
slide because let me say clearly and out
loud and with no ambiguity we do not
trust the government to do elections
that are clean I don't now do I know
therefore that there's proof you know
Court proof that elections in the past
were rigged that's not my claim I'm not
making that claim I'm saying we live in
an environment in which trusting that
this would be the the one area where
things are not rigged is
naive there's not much chance that the
most valuable and easily rigal system is
the only one that's not rigged really
let's let's do the really test on it if
you're new the really test is if you
make a claim and somebody can debunk it
just by tilting their head to the side
and going
really then you don't have a good claim
all right let's try it the claim is that
although we've seen every major system
and every major organization we've ever
trusted to be thoroughly corrupt in the
worst possible ways that the one and
only one exception is our election
systems which we know are not fully
auditable
and yet even though the stakes are
through the roof people think they're
stopping Hitler um so we have the
highest
incentive the lowest probably protection
because it's not fully auditable and
under those conditions you're telling me
that that's the only system in all 50
states run separately all of those 50
states are the only good examples of
things that are not rigged in the entire
United
States really
really but Scott nothing's been proven
in the
courts mean the courts that have also
been shown to be completely corrupt are
you talking about those
courts
yeah so your evidence that the elections
are not
rigged or that the other system that is
rigged says it's
not really
really see that really just
works so as fisher king points out we're
probably going to need a landslide in
order to beat the ballot harvesting and
whatever Shenanigans will happen we
certainly expect
Shenanigans and so the the advice is
this something happened right the the
assassination attempt did change
everything
your common sense and even things you're
hearing in the media is that that
guarantees a trump Victory do not assume
that the only thing that would guarantee
him a victory is a
landslide a a slight Advantage does not
guarantee him anything the only way he
wins is with a landslide you've got to
you've got
to put the pedal to the metal you've got
to accelerate into the corner this isn't
the time where you go well I guess I
don't have to to vote at all no you got
to accelerate into the corner this is
the time to put the afterburners on it's
not the time to
relax all
right um I didn't see this coming but uh
Google has disproved the existence of
god
wow next
story now you probably want some details
don't you yeah so some Google
researchers say they simulated the
emergence of life with just uh programs
so I did an experiment he said what
would happen if you left a bunch of
random data alone for millions of
generations so they just left data
alone and
somehow they witnessed the emergence of
self-replicating digital life
forms so somehow the data managed to
evolve into self-replicating programs
from Rand starting
points so they think uh um it's great
step forward he says understanding the
potential roots to the origin of life
here in the medium quite removed from
the standard wet wear of biology now
they didn't create they didn't create
life in a biological sense what they did
was they showed that Randomness can
create
order how the hell they did that I don't
know doesn't sound terribly doable to me
I'm not sure I trust this story at all
but the claim is that if you can create
order out of nothing and apparently no
God involved that would suggest that uh
maybe we got here without a
God now it doesn't answer the question
of how the whole universe got here
before
life but neither does God because in
both cases you can't have some nothing
making something so if you'd like to
have an answer to the how could it be
that something came from nothing it
didn't there was always something why do
I say there was always something because
everything else is
nonsense if I just say there was always
something all questions are answered
there was always
something all
right now let's talk about a little bit
more about God that was just your
introduction um I saw many many people
and I believe a lot of you were in this
Camp you believe that the fact that
Trump moved his head slightly and he
went from being assassinated to probable
president had to be an act of God how
many of you
felt that God must have had his hand on
that
day in the
comments who who wants to uh say they
think God was
involved probably one of the most common
opinions in the country right now I
would think even if you were not pro
Trump you're probably wondering if God
was involved in that particular incident
yeah lots of yeses lots of yeses
now my regular audience knows that I'm
not a believer in any traditional
sense so uh my journey was I was raised
a Methodist but that didn't take so I
went through an atheist phase and maybe
there was a phase you could have called
me agnostic
uh there was a point where I believed in
the
simulation and that that's sort of where
I am now it's a good model for
understanding things we might be some
kind of simulation a simulation not
unlike what Google discovered with its
random data starting to self-organize
maybe but in this case I would imagine
there's actually a
Creator now I don't know the answer so
let me be very clear I certainly would
not try to convince you I would not try
to convince you the simulation's true
not going to convince you that there is
a God or there's no God I'm just going
to tell you this interesting
fact Biden called for Unity and I said
to myself that is insincere and
political he's been the main driver of
disunity in my opinion and so his calls
for Unity I felt were insincere and
maybe just
self-protective then Trump called for
for
Unity and of course I put the same
filter on it and I
said my God this man can read the
room
the the opportunity to win has already
been given to
him if he wants to win he now has
everything he
needs but there was another opportunity
that was bigger it was the opportunity
to be
Legend he can be the president you want
if he stays feisty and keeps fighting
and says I'm going to you know make sure
that every all the bad people pay for
what they've done and a lot of his Bas
would say that's exactly what I want I'm
so mad W do I want revenge some of you
might say and that would make him
something like a
president if that's what he wanted to be
a president seems like on the surface
that's what he
wants but maybe he wants to be a
legend and so he called for
Unity and he became a
legend now you could say to yourself
Trump has been chasing this narcissistic
dream
forever right since his youngest days
he's always been kind of full of himself
and he's been chasing Glory you might
say and some would say to the point of
maybe it's even ugly that he would Chase
Fame Chase Glory brag about himself
build himself up kind of create this
artificial picture of greatness and you
would say to yourself well you're a good
salesman but I don't know if you're
great you know that's maybe not for me
to
judge and I would say that uh Trump did
not find
greatness I don't think he found it I
think think he chased greatness all of
his life and he did not find
it but it sure as hell found
him and citizens are sort of all over
the
place
and they're starting to come to some
common
understandings they're starting to feel
like something happened they don't quite
understand it but they feel it
and you have the uh media which seems to
at least for a while they seem to have
climbed down a little bit maybe the
media is being nice or a little less
provocative
because they realize that they're in
trouble maybe they're just covering them
their own
butts maybe they've seen the errors in
their way maybe they realize they're
culpable and they feel a little
sheepish so they they've got their own
incentives so if you got Biden who's
probably out for himself you got Trump
who's maybe
opportunistic you've got the citizens
who are all over the place and you've
got the media that seems to be
sheepishly keeping its head down a
little bit in fact we heard today that
morning Joe was canceled this morning so
MSNBC thought that it would be a little
bit too risky to have Morning Joe even
on the air
that's a big deal it feels to some
people like an admission of guilt that
they were part of what created this
situation where somebody would want to
take out a president some of it may be
just good business that they'd rather
keep the news people on there for a
while um we'll see what they do with Joy
Reid and Rachel madow I don't know any
decisions have been made I I advise them
I don't know if you saw on social media
but I advise them to keep their opinion
people up off the air for a
week because there's no way we don't see
them as culpable we
do
and I think keeping Morning Joe off the
air feels like a
confession it feels like a confession
and I don't mind
that you know I I want the
truth more than I need any kind of
Revenge I know I don't need Revenge if I
can get the truth give me the truth and
we're good
now by the way I live my life like that
I've had situations where I really
needed an
apology and I traded the apology for the
truth if you tell me the truth you will
never need to apologize just tell me the
truth that we're good that works it's a
good standard by the
way
so I had this weird feeling yesterday as
I was watching what's happening to the
common conscious of the
country and did you feel that there's a
common
Consciousness did you feel that that
even though we disagree in many ways and
we have different intentions and
different goals and all that that we
were all sort of focusing on the same
thing at the same
time and for a
moment we all wished for the
best now it's it's a lot like your body
isn't it think of your
body you know your your cells in your
body they're not aware that they're part
of a body are
they they're they're just doing their
thing your bones are doing different
things in your skin your eyes are doing
different things in your ears and none
of them are really aware that they're
part of some larger emerging thing which
is you so the human being which is you
is sort of some kind of emerging
property that is the sum of all the
these parts that don't have the same
intention as you they're all just doing
their
thing and then I look at the
world and I think huh there's me believe
in what I believe there's you believe in
what you believe there's somebody else
believing what they believe we don't
have the
same
awareness we don't have the same
intentions we don't have the same
priorities and we got the Biden calling
for Unity maybe it's in sin here you got
Trump calling for Unity maybe he just
reads the
room because he's good at that we've got
all kinds of people all over the
place and yet and yet yesterday I felt
something that I've never felt
before some kind of benevolent
force that I can't explain
did you feel
it now there's definitely evil out there
you can feel that
too but there is some kind of emergent
property that is a benevolent
force and I had once speculated in a
book that God could be your
past and God could be your
future but it's entire enely
possible that God goes through
phases where maybe God
dissembles into
parts and maybe when you watch
civilization start from a bunch of
people carving on
stones and you see that it's marching
inexorably toward better communication
with
itself we
build printing presses we build
telephones we build the
internet what does it all have in common
an instinct to connect an instinct that
is Way Beyond even your biological
instincts it's not about reproduction
there's some larger Instinct that makes
us want to connect and want to connect
better connect faster and so now we have
here we are living in the age of AI and
the age of the
internet and we're watching ing this
great thing called a civilization it's
all these different parts they got
different intentions different thoughts
different
priorities and somehow there's an
emerging property from all of it called
civilization and maybe there are other
emerging properties that you didn't see
coming and are not the intention of any
of the
parts and yesterday that's what it felt
like it felt like God was reassembling
and you could feel
it
now I didn't say that just so I could
write tell you that I wrote a book about
it but I did write a book about it if
you want to see the the fictional
version of God reassembling that's what
the book's about
and I got to tell you that as someone
who doesn't believe in these standard
model of religion I felt something and
still feel it and it's bigger than the
evil is
bigger so keep an eye on
that um we're watching a number of
people come forward and say that uh the
event made them Trump supporters but it
is what I call the fake because I've
talked about this a lot a fake because
is in the world of persuasion is where
somebody really really wants to be
persuaded they want to change their mind
in fact they've already decided to
change their mind but they're going to
need a reason because they may have
changed their mind for emotional reasons
they may they may need an external
reason to change their mind but it's a
fake reason they've already changed
their mind in in their
heads and apparently the assassination
attempt is that fake
because uh I'll just read you one of
them James in Galera I think he's a tech
guy in San Francisco he says the the dam
broke for me and many others today I
live in San Francisco where it's a
social death sentence to voice support
for Trump regardless I will be voting
for Trump this election and will voice
my support publicly and unabashedly
social and financial consequences be
damned a very serious line was crossed
today yes it
was how many people feel like James
don't know because remember we're not
talking about people who changed their
minds we're talking about people who had
maybe long ago changed their minds but
they couldn't admit it they were
afraid so do you know what went away
fear fear went
away the people who were afraid of
saying what they
believed now are willing to say what
they believe now I don't know how big
this is but James says it's some common
feeling and anecdotally I am seeing a
lot of it anecdotally I'm seeing people
come out of the Trump closet and say you
know what I don't care what
happens we we have to stop now and fix
this let's fix
this there is a benevolent Force it's
not
Trump and it's not because Trump found
greatness it's because somehow it found
him where does that come
from that's the big question isn't it
well the fact that Trump would go with
the unity theme is a lesson in
Persuasion that uh in fact I just gave
this lesson to my manave
people the people who subscribe on
locals it goes like this persuasion only
works when it's the right
timing if Trump had said before the
assassination attempt you know what I
decided to go with a Unity theme would
his Bas have said what Unity theme do
you have any idea what they're trying to
do to you they just they're try they're
going to try to kill you and then they
do try to kill him not they but one
crazy
guy and then instead of getting madder
and he certainly was mad when he got
shot you could tell that but instead of
doing what they expect him to do which
is go crazy and unleashes white
supremacist Army that doesn't exist
he reads the room
correctly
again how many times does Trump have to
read the room correctly before he
realize it's not an
accident and he says he's going to go
for Unity he's going to change up the
whole
approach now do you mind if Trump is
thinking maybe in terms of just
political expediency and it's just a
good
strategy do you mind if
Biden and the media are just covering
their
asses I don't think you do I think what
you need is the outcome you don't need
their
intentions you just need not to be
shot you don't need their good
feelings you just need a civil
society and so like all of your body
parts that don't really have anything in
common and they don't have any intention
and they're just doing their thing maybe
all all these people are just doing
their thing too
just taking their shot when their shot
is available to them and the emerging
property is
Unity so here's what I think I think
that Trump is not just reading the room
he's not just being political he has
entered presidential
mode meaning that he too sees that the
other side is
capitulated they have realized that he's
going to be their president perhaps he's
realizing it too or more importantly
he's going to persuade it into
existence so he may stop acting like a
candidate
immediately and he might start acting
like he's already your
president remember he told you he would
solve the war in Ukraine before he was
sworn in he just had to get elected now
he doesn't even need to get
elected if Trump wants something to
happen at this point he can already make
it happen
he's already our president in our
minds now we know you know there's a
process and he's got to get elected and
all that but Democrat and
Republican they know he's your
president when he raised his
F he became he became your
president well he wasn't the only thing
that God shot because even though he l
lost an ear um and one per well two
people lost their life if you count the
shooter two badly injured let's not
forget about
that but uh something else got
assassinated it was
Dei Dei is never going to be the
same when you think Dei is making it uh
let's say harder to deal with your
business or maybe you lost your
promotion or something very annoying but
when you see Dei might have killed your
president and that is exactly what it
looks like it looks like that's what
happened that'll that'll wake you up and
I think that now um people can say in
the fullest voice they can Dei is a
horrible evil process it is brought us
to the it brought us to the brink of
Civil War it did it literally brought us
there because if that guy had been let's
say taken out earlier it would have just
been a security
story imagine if they'd taken him out
before he took the
shot then it's a security story and then
wow they did a good job and it wouldn't
change everything it would just make you
really wake up but it wouldn't change
everything taking the shot changed
everything
so
um Dei looks like it was the problem one
of the Dei agents uh you know how the
visual is always going to be more
persuasive than anything anybody says
and the visual of that one security
agent who looked like Melissa
McCarthy she looked like that actress
who pretends to be you know an
incompetent police officer or detective
looked just like an actress couldn't put
her gun back in the holster didn't look
like she knew what she was there for now
I don't know what she was thinking or
even if she did a good job so I'm not a
judge of you know whether any of them
did their job right I'm just saying the
way it looked was that she wasn't hired
for her
capability and you can't get that image
out of your head because the stakes were
so high and you're going to see that so
many
times anyway apparently Biden's social
media called Trump a dictator minutes
before the assassination
attempt uh the post said America wants a
president not a dictator that was on his
Facebook page right before the
assassination and of course everywhere
on social media you're seeing these
compilation clips of all the times the
Democrats and Biden called Trump a
dictator of fascist or Hiller and I'm
not sure I'm not sure if the left ever
really understood how much danger they
were
creating but let me put it in
context uh I asked chat GPT this I said
if somebody created a situation that
they knew was likely to get somebody
killed but it was only a statistical
kind of a thing it wasn't a cause and
effect directly would that be a crime is
it a crime to create a situation which
you
knowingly created with a complete
awareness that there's a high likelihood
somebody would die from it well
apparently that's a crime so here's what
uh chat gbt says it says creating a
situation that you know is likely to
kill someone and then it does result in
death can be classified as something
called Reckless
homicide or it could could be called
depraved heart murder in other words you
were so uncaring that you created a
situation where your depraved heart made
it happen but maybe not in the direct
cause and effect way and then there's
also uh under some places it would be
second deegree
murder Now give me a fact
Jack um fact Jack
was that what happened to Derek
shauvin I thought Derek Chauvin was
essentially
convicted because he should have known
he was creating a situation that could
have led to death and he didn't do the
right things to make it not that
situation so they're not saying he
killed him as in I know I'm killing you
die die that would be first degree
murder I guess but he did something that
created a
situation that through his actions um
increased the odds that George Floyd
would die and that was enough to put him
in
jail now how is that functionally
different than what the Democrats and
the Democrat leaning media has been
doing for
years to me it looks crystal clear and
to all of you all right you have the
same opinion that they created a
situation which any reasonable person
would have known would have caused
probable death now how do I know that a
reasonable person would know that what
they were doing would cause death
because there were so many reasonable
people who said what you're doing is
going to get somebody killed I've listed
them before you know it's your everybody
from Tucker Carlson to you know Mike
cage to me to Molly Hemingway to do you
want 10 more do you want 10 more I can
give you 10 more I mean I could listen
them all day long all reasonable people
saw this situation and if all reasonable
people can tell that this is going to
get somebody killed and then somebody
gets
killed isn't that
illegal based on our
system now there's no reasonable way
that anybody could go to jail for it in
this situation because there too many
people involved and if you created that
standard then all political speech would
end up getting you know sucked into it
so as a practical matter you can't
really go after anybody for it and your
president and maybe your future
president are both calling for
Unity Unity would suggest that you don't
put people in jail for their political
speech even if they knew it was going to
get somebody
killed because it's political speech and
it's too important to protect it but if
you want to know how dire it was if you
want to know how Reckless it was it was
murder
now it might have been second deegree
murder it might have been called this
other weird thing depraved heart murder
it might be called Reckless homicide but
we all recognize it in a common sense
way as
murder you just watch the Democrat
machine with complete knowledge of what
they were doing create a murder
machine that tried to execute his murder
and the only thing that saved it from
happening was Trump turned his head
that's it but the murder still happened
because a man got murdered in the in the
stands
so I'm not going to forget that and I'm
not going to forgive
it I can I can find Unity but I will
never forgive
this I don't think any of you should I
don't recommend any kind of violence of
course but forgiveness absolutely not no
cuz this was done with complete
knowledge of what they're doing I like
to forgive
mistakes if somebody does something as a
mistake yeah yeah I mean you don't want
mistakes but i' forgive
it but if you spend years doing a thing
which you know the outcome of that thing
that's
likely no you don't get forgiven for
doing a plan of evil for years in a row
and putting all of your energy into it
no I don't forgive Hiller I don't for
give Stalin and while I'm not saying
that any of these people are Hitler or
Stalin I'm saying only in the the you
know very narrow sense that there are
some actions that are
unforgivable this is
unforgivable what Joy Reed and madow and
Morning Joe have done to this country
not not just by themselves but with
others is completely
unforgivable I hope it's also
Unforgettable because it's it's the only
way we'll be able to keep any kind of
unity if we ever get there so you can
you can stand down and you can tell
yourself you can be the better person
you can tell yourself that for the good
of the country you're not going to seek
retribution and I don't think you
should but you should not forgive do not
forgive that is completely
inappropriate all right and so you're
seeing what I call play dumb week by the
media I actually watched in horror as a
host on
MSNBC said she was trying to understand
what would radicalize people to be like
this what what would cause that shooter
to be willing to do what he did and I
watched that and I said are you really
going to tell me right to my face you
don't know that you did it not you
personally but you
collectively radically izing your base
to violence you didn't know that was
happening of course you knew of course
you knew you got exactly what you hoped
would happen in your fantasy of politics
they wanted him taken
out um so you're going to see them all
act like they're confused about why the
public has no Unity they're all confused
and it may be because of what Trump has
said now does Trump cause some disunity
yes does he kind did he cause the kind
of disunity that should get him shot
no no because if you took that standard
then everybody who got raped had it
coming everybody who had a wallet should
get robbed everybody who had a door you
could kick down should get you know home
invaded everybody who had a car with
windows that break should get you know
should get their car stolen no no we
have to have a system that's a little
more proximate than that and if one
group is saying you are a person who
should be killed that's why Hiller is a
person who should be killed that is
different from saying there are too many
criminals coming into the country those
are not the same and all of the efforts
to both sides it are just ass covering
because the journalists are literally
concerned about being
killed speaking of which Jens saki said
I'm scared for journalists after Trump's
assassination attempt the daily wire is
reporting that
now don't be
violent I have to say that
first there's no call for violence
you're probably going to get everything
you want without it so violence would be
really stupid really stupid don't do
anything to any
journalists but should they be scared
 yes they should be scared they
should be scared all the way down to
their boot
they should be shaking they should know
exactly what they did to the country and
they should be scared don't
touch them don't touch them don't touch
a hair on their heads or you're the
 don't be like them the worst
crime is to be like them don't be like
them let them live with what they've
done let them live with it they know
what they did and they should be afraid
of being killed don't kill them don't
touch them don't do any violence
absolutely not but should they be afraid
yes everybody who does something like
that should be afraid they should be
very afraid don't do it
again just don't do it again we can find
Unity it can be done and we're willing
to do it don't be like
that don't become them
van Jones is uh sane uh he's he's
usually the sane one now of course he's
biased for his team and that's fine
because he wears his bias publicly right
I don't mind anybody who's biased and
says I'm biased you know I'm for my team
so here's what I think it's good for my
team that's fine that's politics
perfectly acceptable no problem with it
so and Van Jones is always in that
category for me that even when I don't
like the
politics even when I think he may be
stretched a point a a little bit I'm
like oh that's fine you're not crazy you
don't hate me that's different all right
here's what he says he says America
dodged a bullet last night if that thing
had been a quarter inch over you'd have
you'd have had an assassination half of
the country would have felt the other
half of the country took their
leader that is correct van
Jones half of the country would not have
said that was a lone
shooter because it wasn't that was
shooter who was rad radicalized by the
bad forces on one side of the country we
would have seen it as you killed our
leader that's exactly how we would have
seen it so that's that is an accurate
assessment and he said you would have
had millions of people ready to shoot
back let me
clarify not as
Citizens there's no Republican who
wanted to go out and just start shooting
Democrats
did anybody think that yeah that would
be such a complete fundamental
misunderstanding of what a Republican or
a conservative or Trump supporter is
that would be a complete
misunderstanding no we don't want to
kill
citizens citizens are the ones we like
even the ones we disagree with right we
like the Democrats we like Americans we
like Americans if you're American and
you're not bothering
us nobody wants to shoot you we'll
protect you we'll we'll prevent somebody
from shooting you if we
can no we're weren't going after any
citizens were were there any you know
players who are especially bad who might
have to worry about legal action I don't
know maybe but it would be special cases
it's not like a it's not like some
general Roundup of anything there's no
energy for that even if Trump had been
assassinated it wasn't going to be
killing people in the streets
there's no energy for that there's no
reason nobody's talked about it nobody
thinks about it it's not a thing but I
do think that when the Press talks about
it there's a little bit of an
acknowledgement that they're the cause
because they are people and I've said
this a million times but it's more
obvious now than ever citizens don't get
their opinions by looking at facts and
thinking and coming up with their own
point of view are a political opinions
are assigned from somebody some place
it's from the media now probably the you
know the parties have something to do
with what the media says but the media
is a brainwasher the citizens don't come
up with their own opinions that's not a
thing so of course the citizens would be
mad whoever radicalized this guy to kill
their leader of course they would and
the Press would be in great danger now
if the president had been shot would the
there have been violence against the
Press I don't
know I know there wouldn't have been
violence against just regular Democrats
who are just being regular people who
disagree that's not a thing but would
the Press have been seen as the
murderer well they would have been the
murderer I don't know if anybody would
have acted on it it would have been
foolish and I very much don't recommend
it no violence no violence no violence
don't become them you don't have to
they've disgraced themselves their own
actions will take care of this right
just shine some light on it until the
cockroaches have to you know do what
they
do
now all right um now some people are
still hanging tough Reed Hoffman tried
to bsid it and make it sound like well
you know Trump's got some bad rhetoric
too nope we're not buying it and uh I
don't know what's up with Reed Hoffman
and some of the other you know famous
people who are saying things that look
like it's their job now Reed Hoffman's a
billionaire doesn't need a job but he
acts like this is his job meaning he's
either getting paid for it which doesn't
make sense because he's already a
billionaire so he wouldn't do it for the
money or he's being
blackmailed so I'll go with the default
the default assumption is blackmail he
does have some Epstein Island
connections which there's no no
indication that he did anything illegal
on Epstein island or anything else
there's no indication of any illegality
but the way he acts is so off
model that it's being driven by
something we don't understand so if it's
not being driven by money and I don't
think it is it's being driven by
something is not being driven by mental
illness because he clearly doesn't have
any
is not being driven by his own let's say
lack of intelligence he's brilliant he's
not even just ordinary smart he's super
smart right so whatever is driving
him from the outside it looks like
blackmail that's what it looks like and
indeed I think that a whole bunch of
what we don't understand about why
things are the way they are is blackmail
I believe that um the easily blackmailed
become important parts of the system
because they're easily blackmailed and
if you happen to have billions of
dollars and you're you know good at
stuff as he is the odds of getting
blackmailed are probably through the
roof how many do you how many times do
you think that people have tried to
Blackmail Elon
Musk a lot I'll bet you a lot yeah
apparently there were two attempts on
his life this year two attempts that
were
thwarted yeah you don't think anybody's
trying to blackmail him of course they
are of course they are anybody who could
blackmail him would have a lot of power
so yeah I think we live in a blackmail
system and anytime you see something
like this um you know whether it's Rob
rer or Stephen King or any of the ones
who don't look like they're acting
rationally um you should at least
suspect that somebody got to them don't
know can't can't know for sure it's just
what it looks like
all
right um George
takai who used to play Sulu in the old
Star Trek you know him he said Trump
remains an existential threat to
democracy we'll defeat him with ballots
not
bullets
George you know until this very moment
I'd been quite supportive of him because
he's funny and I liked him as an actor
and I think he's you know has a good
heart but uh you're going to have to do
better than this George if you don't
understand this calling him an
existential threat to democracy
increases the chance of death you need
to shut the up
for well I don't want to say forever
because that sounds bad you need to get
off social
media because you're not part of the
solution my friend you are part of the
 problem you need need to take
this attitude and shove it right up your
 ass and get out of here because
your party called for
Unity Trump called for Unity you're the
 trying to ruin it and we don't
need your weird fear about the end of
the Democracy that's weak thinking if
you can't even think
strong maybe you're not helping all
right think a little bit better and
maybe you could help
over at ABC News Martha rits uh seems to
be blaming uh blaming it on Trump's
rhetoric you're going to see more of
that they're going to test that out to
blame Trump and let me just say that
anybody who's blaming Trump after a
bullet took off his
ear you're the biggest pieces of shits
in the world I mean you are real scum
you're you're evil at a level that I
can't even understand and and if you
want to be that big a piece of
Martha rits and everybody else who's
going to take this approach just know
that being you is the penalty you know
what my revenge is to Martha Ritz that
she has to wake up as Martha Raditz
tomorrow whatever that is it ain't good
it ain't good do I want any rest rest uh
I don't Revenge nope I don't need need
more Revenge than the fact that I'm not
 Martha Raditz I don't need more
Revenge than I'm not George teai I don't
need more Revenge that I'm not
Joe Scarboro or Joy Reed
or piece of Rachel
madow that's my revenge my revenge is I
get to wake up every day and be the one
that they that cancel that they cancel
which feels pretty damn
good now of course uh the controversy is
why the heck was this the Secret Service
not as effective as they could be of
course Dei is part of the story uh if
you think it's not part of the story you
haven't been paying attention it's not
just a political opportunity where
people could say Dei is bad it really
was part of the story now now we've
learned that these were not the 18 and
there were a lot ofs people were
borrowed from the Department of Homeland
Security and may not have been up to the
job may have been in different training
you know maybe they didn't work together
we've heard things about the comms being
bad maybe the cop couldn't get to him I
heard people saying that the police
officer who saw him on the roof um
should have done more it sounds like he
ran away that didn't happen uh my
understanding is that the police officer
climbed up the ladder when his head went
up you know so he could be seen the
shooter aimed his gun at him he ducked
down and then the guy started shooting
at Trump so there wasn't really any time
for that cop to react I mean he just
ducked and then the shooting started so
I don't think he's the bad guy I think
he might be closer to a good guy who
didn't didn't do what he wanted to do I
mean he acted he saw a threat he acted
all right that's what you wanted right
he saw a threat and he went toward it
you don't need him to keep his head up
when a gun is pointing at it you don't
need that so I hope I hope that that
policeman gets the credit that I think
he deserves right we're still in the fog
of War don't know don't know everything
but at the moment I think I would re I
would pull back from hating on that one
because he may have been the the one who
did exactly what he should have done in
that situation he just didn't have time
to stop
it and we don't know exactly why the
Sharpshooters didn't take the shot when
we think they could have seen it lots
will come
out let's wait for see if we can find
out we do suspect the worst that maybe
had some kind of incompetent leadership
that told him not to
fire if he had incompetent leadership
that told him not to fire I I heard one
rumor that the rule was he couldn't fire
unless the shooter fired first first
that doesn't sound
believable so I I'm a little worried
about anything that I see on on this
story I don't believe that would be the
rule and if somebody points a gun at a
president you have to wait till they
shoot no I'm pretty sure that's not the
rule so don't believe anything you hear
in that
yet um the FBI says they can't get into
the shooter's cell phone
don't Don't make me say it don't make me
say it I'm going to say it oh you're
going to make me say it the FBI admits
they can't open the shooter's cell
phone
really
really
really do I need to say anything else
is there any deeper dive that is needed
other
than
really does anybody think that that
sounds
okay no no I'm
sorry I don't believe any of
that so uh I don't know what's going on
but I certainly don't believe that that
remember the FBI is a low credibility
organization um at the moment because of
leadership
if a low credibility Place tells you a
thing that you know is possible is
impossible what should be your
assumption
guilt yeah my assumption is that the FBI
probably doesn't want you to know what's
on the phone now I don't know that's
true don't know it but what would be the
reasonable assumption that there's one
phone in the world that they can't
hack I don't
know um maybe
maybe apparently there's a movie I think
the Daily Caller is behind it called
rigged and it would be on the topic of
the 2020 election and they say big Tech
is uh interfering and Google is
censoring it again oh
surprise massive censorship again in the
media
landscape but thanks to X at least
there's some uh push back
um so let me tell you if that movie ever
becomes available I don't know if it's I
don't know if it's available yet they're
complaining about the social media but I
didn't see if it's available as soon as
it's available I'm going to watch
it um but Beware of the documentary
effect Beware of the documentary effect
all right so it's a documentary which by
its description seems to be a story
where they'll show you that the election
was rigged in ways you don't know
about it's a
documentary it will be convincing do you
know why it's a
documentary what about all the facts
that they're going to show you that's
the reason it's convincing right nope
it's a documentary that's why it's
convincing if they can make you sit
there for an hour watching one point of
view with no counterpoints you will be
convinced likewise if somebody makes a
documentary to show that our elections
were perfect in 2020 and you sat there
for hour and you watched it you would
come away thinking you actually I'm
convinced those elections were pristine
you will be convinced that it was rigged
if you watch a movie or a documentary
called
rigged you all get that right that if
you think you're going to watch a
documentary called rigged and you're
going to come away knowing if it was
rigged that's not what's going to happen
it's not designed that way the design of
a documentary is to make you think what
the documentary wants you to think it's
not to make you understand what's
reality now it could be the same
sometimes the documentary does in fact
have the grasp on reality and that you
didn't have it before and then it gives
it to you and and that could be exactly
what's
happening but I wouldn't believe it
because it was
believable that's the caution at the end
of it you're going to say well you know
Scott said I'm going to be persuaded but
honestly I'm not persuaded because it's
a document
I'm persuaded because they had the goods
they showed their evidence they showed
the people they showed the documents
it's very clear no I'm convinced because
the evidence don't fall for
that don't fall for that you're
convinced because it's a documentary if
you lose sight of that you can be
convinced of anything because the very
next documentary could be complete
 and you'll be like yep yep
looks good to me don't see any
Counterpoint now I have happen to think
that the rigged movie is probably closer
to True than not that's my bias but
that's just a
bias so just be just wear your uh
intellectual armor when you watch any
documentary whether it's this one or not
I guess that's a good enough commercial
isn't
it that wasn't a commercial announcement
but if but if I ever gave you a better
reason to watch a documentary I don't
think I
have all right uh you do recall that
Alex Jones was sued for saying that
Sandy Hook was staged right remember
that he lost everything billion dollars
he got sued for lost his business
reputation because he suggested that the
Sandy Hook shooting was not what it
looked
like and that caused stress for the
family members and they successfully
sued and he lost
everything now it turns out that a whole
bunch of people on left and apparently
this is a big Trend are saying that the
attempted assassination of trump was not
real it was staged by
Trump and that somebody was a
sharpshooter and shot his ear and
carefully made sure that they didn't do
any worse than shooting his
ear now I saw a guest on CNN last night
say that that was just batshit
crazy which is a good sign now I don't
know if that if that guest leaned left
or right it was someone I hadn't seen
before but he was somebody who was
speaking with authority and said no
that's that is
crazy that's not something you should
entertain nobody set up nobody sets up a
deal where their ear gets shot from 150
fet Away by a guy who got rejected from
his shooting club in school because he
wasn't good at shooting no nobody goes
to the 20-year-old and by the
way uh well let me just finish this
point so some say that all those people
saying that it was a setup and it was
staged would be causing some kind of
trauma to people and could they sue no
I'm not in favor of that I'm just saying
that why did Alex Jones get sued for
this if it doesn't apply
here why does the law only apply in some
cases is somebody Above the Law because
I was told reliably nobody's Above the
Law now I don't think that the Sandy
Hook thing should have been successful
because I think that Alex Jones was
saying something he thought was true and
then it wasn't that's my take I I think
he thought it was true because he
doesn't seem to say a lot of things that
you could tell he knows are not true if
you watch you know
MSNBC it does seem like they're saying
things that maybe they don't think is
true but I don't get that for Alex Jones
I think he may be wrong sometimes but he
sure looks like he believes it should
you be sued for being aggressively wrong
in your opinion I don't think that's
right I don't think it's right even if
it it' upset somebody
terribly um so I would say that neither
neither cases should be subject for
lawsuits but uh you have to wonder why
one is and one
isn't I would like to also point out uh
the following
if you believed as the left does that
this might have been a stag thing that's
as crazy as believing that um the
Democrats were somehow behind the
shooter and let and let me let me tell
you if you hadn't thought of
this let let me tell you why it's
obvious so if you believe that let's say
the the Deep state or somebody um was
working with this
20-year-old nobody picks a 20-year-old
to do something like that do you know
why you can't trust a 20-year-old to do
anything if if you were going to work
out some kind of clever assassination
plot you'd go for late 20s early 30s
maybe older because you'd have somebody
who' actually know what they're doing
and then you'd say well not only could
you get away with this because you know
what you're doing but um you know we
think we can shut you up afterwards and
all the all the trail will be covered
nobody gets a 20-year-old who is bullied
and says why don't you become part of my
clever plan he wouldn't be part of
Trump's clever plan to shoot his own ear
ridiculous and he wouldn't be part of
the cia's plan because they're never
going to use an asset that would be that
undependable a 20-year-old who was
bullied with mental
problems not a chance not a chance
now the the more likely and obvious
explanation to see just got radicalized
by the media which would include Tik
Tock reels and wherever else he was
watching we don't know what he watched
and
um one reason that you could imagine if
the FBI is lying about their access to
his phone and his social media you could
imagine somebody in the FBI and
Leadership you could imagine it I'm not
saying it happened you could imagine
that if that person was radicalized by
specific people in the
media that the FBI might
say this is where we're not going to
give you any
transparency now I'm not going to name a
name as an example but you know fill in
the name with your own example suppose
they found on the phone that he was an
obsessive listener to a specific kind of
content with a specific
host I don't want the FBI to tell me
that do you know why
because that would paint a Target on
that host back and as Despicable as I
think many people in the media Ben you
don't want to paint a Target on
somebody's back I don't want to see any
anybody get hurt even if they did
terrible terrible things I need the
legal system to do what it does and I
need to stay out of it and the Citizens
need to stay out of it
anyway
um rasmason did a poll on hand counted
ballots says that uh a lot of people
believe the paper ballots are more
trustworthy and here's the interesting
part a majority of people they surveyed
a majority said they'd volunteer to
count
ballots and you know it was the first
thing I thought I'd do
that I I would I would volunteer do you
know what would really bring the country
together you want some Unity stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with me and help me
count
ballots and disagree with me about
everything but helped me count
ballots if I could count ballots with
you we're going to find
Unity it's the same reason that I
recommend that you don't try to get out
of jury
duty there's sometimes you might need to
get out of it but you should make it a
goal like visiting
Mecca right it's practically a religious
experience other people say the same
thing when you see the seriousness of
your fellow citizens to get it right to
get it
right it changes you you don't you come
away from that thinking wow we do have
this one thing that protects us the one
thing is if you put 12 citizens in a
room who have been vetted to be on the
jury they're going to try hard to get it
right and I saw it with my own eyes now
I think in the extreme political
situations is still breaks you know the
Trump situation but for everything else
they might be right on their verdicts
and they might be wrong but boy do they
try to get it right they really try to
get it right and if you haven't
experienced somebody trying really hard
to get it right for other citizens
they're trying to get it right for the
victims but they're also trying to get
it right for the accused because the
accused isn't always
guilty so you have to have that
experience and a lot of people
won't now the nearest thing that I could
think of that would connect you to the
you know the process that is what makes
America America would be counting
ballots I want to stand with you
shoulder Tosh shoulder and count ballots
at the same time you did one one two
two
Etc that's how you get
Unity you Unity is from working together
even on something trivial like counting
ballots do you know why people who have
been in the military together become
best friends for life even if one's a
Democrat one's a republican wouldn't
make any difference because the
experience Unity comes from shared
activity and that shared activity if
it's around the country's you know core
beliefs is going to be your strongest
Unity so U 38 % of likely voters um
think handmark ballots are more
trustworthy than the touch screens 16%
say they're less trustworthy look at
that you couldn't even get 25% of the
country to say that they're less
trustworthy and I always joke that 25%
get everything wrong couldn't even get
25% and
uh about 41% think it's about equal
that's not bad you know I think they're
wrong
but it's not crazy to think well maybe
they're about the
same all right here's something that
Naval
rant advises us and let me tell you
something about noval if it's the first
time you've heard his name uh you have
no exposure I'm going to tell you what
other people already know when he says
something you should stop what you're
doing and listen to
it because it's going to be different
from what you've heard
and it's going to be almost always the
better take probably could be the strong
the smartest person I
know um and he has uh just three
sentences these are the three take
takeaways if you get these three things
right then all the other things that
look like they're going to take you down
you will be protected against here's
nal's three things resist censorship res
resist
lawfare resist
disarmament everything else is
Downstream resist censorship resist
lawfare resist
disarmament everything else is
Downstream that's all you needed to
know that that's the fight there are
three vectors of the fight stay armed
resist lawfare make sure you keep your
free speech if you have those three
things the public has some power if you
lose those three or any of
them then fascism is
guaranteed well I'd like to end with uh
some uh poit some uh some
science um there's a new way to screen
for drunk drivers using AI when you're
in the car so now the AI your car
potentially it's not there yet will be
able to scan you and it will look for
signs of intoxication and it says it can
find that you're drunk with 75%
accuracy I'd love to see that used on um
K
haris do you think you could create an
AI that would just look at somebody's
mannerisms compare it to their Baseline
and tell you if they're drunk yeah of
course you
could do you think you could do that on
Kera
if you looked at some speeches where she
clearly wasn't and then you looked at
some where she's going crazy about
school buses and vend diagrams and
laughing like a hyena yeah you could I
believe the AI could determine that
she's drunk I think
so
um but this gets me halfway to what I
really need what I want is AI that can
tell me if I accidentally got
decaf um you know that the other day I
accidentally had decaf I didn't look
look at the little coffee pod closely
enough and I thought that I was dying
from long
Co and it wasn't until I realized oh my
God I'd accidentally poisoned myself
with decaf and I corrected it and I was
on the mend well I need AI to tell me
that and uh do you think you could tell
if if I've gotten my caffeine well this
is me with caffeine would you like to
see my impression of me without caffeine
all right I'll read the same story
without
caffeine so there's uh
there a some kind of a story about uh
what is this about some driving about
the driving and the uh scanning in the
cars with the uh what are they using
some kind of a some kind of an AI Robert
Mitchum again I'm stealing Dana carvey's
joke where he makes fun of uh Joe Biden
by throwing in Robert Mitchum into his
Babble
talk so please tell me if I've had decaf
there was a meta anal is of 188
studies uh that seem to confirm that
women experience a thing called impostor
syndrome more frequently than men wow a
metaanalysis of 10 studies how about
that so I did a metaanalysis on
metaanalyses and if you do a
metaanalysis on
metaanalyses you will determine that
metaanalyses are not science they're not
logical and they're not credible they're
complete that they sold to you
as science they're basically The
credibility of
astrology because with meta analysis you
get to pick which things are in your
study and which are not and you usually
say things like oh this one's a bad
study I'll throw it away then maybe one
of your studies is much bigger than the
others you just throw it in and you
don't know that it completely that one
study basically moved the statistical
treatment completely and if that one was
bad they're all bad because it over welm
the small ones because they took an
average metaanalysis is not real every
time you see
metaanalysis in a story it means they
didn't use
science it doesn't mean they use extra
science it doesn't mean it's Deluxe
science because metaanalysis sounds like
wow it's not just science it's layers of
science I mean I started with some
science the one study but then I added
some science and then I added some
science on top of that and I added some
more science and then you won't even
believe this but I wrapped it in a ball
of science called metaanalysis and now I
have more science than anybody ever had
science believe me believe me people
science no metaanalysis is not real it's
something they
do but you shouldn't believe
it there is a drug that might reverse
diabetes uh let me read it to you like
didn't have caffeine uh something about
mice I don't know something about mice
but it's kind of cool to think that they
there are scientists who could make the
uh diabetes and mice go
away um as you probably know if you
watch my show a lot the odds of going
from a mouse study to hey this works in
people too is actually really low I
think the mice are good at telling you
if you die they're not good at telling
you a drug Works they're pretty good at
telling you if it's toxic you not
completely good at it but uh don't
confuse the mouse studies with reality
don't confuse meta analysis with science
and whatever you do don't believe that
prediction models about climate change
are science because it's not it's
adjacent to science very much not
science all right that's what I got for
you today I'm going to go talk
to um you're going to talk to the locals
people privately thanks for joining
