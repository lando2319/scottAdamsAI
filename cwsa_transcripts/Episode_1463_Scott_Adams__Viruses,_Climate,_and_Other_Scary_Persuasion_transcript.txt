well well well you have come to the
right place
this is the place for coffee with scott
adams the best time of the whole day
once again it's going to be a good one a
barn burner
they say and all you need is a copper
mug or glass a tanker challengers die in
a candy jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it's
gonna happen now
go
oh yeah yeah that was tremendous
as good as you imagined it would be
probably
probably oh a good drawing of a robot
there in the comments
thank you well well well let me start
with uh
the funniest tweet of the day from glenn
greenwald you all know about obama
having a big
birthday party his 60th birthday party
and he invited a lot of what the new
york times call
sophisticated vaccinated people
so unlike your sturgis where there's a
bunch of
unsophisticated people
obama's birthday had sophisticated
vaccinated people much safer
well glenn greenwald uh tweeted on this
perfectly and said
uh there was a photo attached he said
here's biden's climate crisis is our
john kerry
arriving on his private jet to attend
obama's masculist party
it's all there everything you need to
know about the world
in one tweet the climate
climate is ours on a private jet and
obama's got a maskless
mass gathering so
how about the rest of you how was your
maskless mass gathering was it as good
as mine
that's right we didn't have one so
everybody's mad about the hypocrisy and
i guess they should
uh there's a some cdc official but not
all of them
finally said this he said that we will
all be exposed
to the coronavirus by the end of the
year maybe next year
now what does exposed mean
exposed we'll all be exposed to the
virus mostly the delta variant i think
does exposed mean that if you have a
vaccination and you are exposed to it
do you carry any of the virus with you
still a little bit uncertain
because we know that vaccinated people
do not only carry the virus
but can have as much viral load as
someone who's not vaccinated at all
at least in some cases that we've
determined
but does that mean that
let's say you're vaccinated and you
don't have any symptoms but you got some
virus
are you going to put off as much
i would think not logically
because if you're not coughing you're
not spreading it as much
and if you're not gasping for air
because your lungs are not working
maybe you're not breathing as much but
you'd still be putting off plenty i mean
if you had the same
full viral load just breathing would be
a problem i would think so
i tend to agree with the cdc guy who
says we'll all be exposed because i
don't see anything in the
in the works that would change it do you
is there anything happening
that would change the fact we'll all be
exposed because
it doesn't look like we're even close to
something that would
look like shutting it down and you'd
have to shut it down sort of everywhere
all over the world
for it to make a difference in any
country assuming borders open up again
so i just don't think we can get there
and i feel that
we should be a little more honest about
that so the reason to get the
vaccination is not to stop the virus
but to stop it from progressing in your
own body
um there's a i guess israel has a new
drug
for targeting the chronovirus it looks
pretty promising
because the way it works and they've
tested it in a small test
so we don't have any randomized
controlled trials yet
but in a small test a whole bunch of
people who were very sick
left the hospital in five days or less
and
i guess 93 percent of 90 chronoviruses
that were serious
in several greek hospitals they had to
test
the israelis had to test their covax
their covenant drug in greece because
there wasn't enough covenant in israel
israel did such a good job that they
didn't have they couldn't do a test of
it there
so they tested it there and it was
hugely successful what it does
is it targets the cytokine cytokine
whatever you what whatever that is storm
that happens
the thing that makes you so sick is that
your own immune response goes nuts
so apparently this drug uh just calms
down your immune response
presumably just from this from the virus
i don't know
but uh gigantic potential
but how long does it take i don't think
this is going to get some kind of
emergency authorization so maybe it
doesn't matter it might take too long
i'd like to give you an update on my
personal quest
to make masks impractical
at least in certain places so
was it yesterday yesterday i went to a
restaurant
and did not wear a mask
now a mask was required and if they had
asked me to put it on i would have
but as soon as you sit down i think it's
probably the same everywhere
as soon as you sit down at the table and
they bring you a glass of water or even
before they do
you take your mask off so the only
reason for the mask
is to stand at the hostess stand for
five seconds
and then walk twelve feet to where
you're going to take your mask off in
the same space
the whole time kind of ridiculous
so i tried to see what would happen if i
just didn't wear a mask
and the host had to see me without a
mask
what would the host do and the answer is
the host
ignored my maskless state and seated me
also ignored the entire party in front
of me
that checked in just before me all
maskless
the restaurant just has already given up
they've given up
here's a sign you should put on your gym
you ready for this
here's the sign i want on your gym it
says
masks are mandated by the state
if you don't wear a mask we'll ask you
to put one on
and that's all we'll do that's the sign
master mandated if you're not wearing
one we will ask you to put one on
and that's all we'll do
message received right and then you just
go to the gym without your mask and
they'll say hey
put your mask on and then you say
thanks for thanks for reminding me and
you just go on with your business
wouldn't that work i know
we'll find out i think well the ipcc
has a new report on climate let me guess
huh do you think the ipcc will say
we're doing a great job on climate and
everything's getting
better do you think that's what they
came up with or
do you think they uh waited several
years for a new report and said
you know it looks exactly the same as
the last time we reported on it
you think that's going to happen in our
world
or just maybe
just maybe will the report look like
can i can i bring a special guest in
i believe some of you know him his name
is dale
dale can you give us the highlight
summary of the new ipcc report on the
climate
[Applause]
we're all going to die we're going gonna
die
die in a giant fireball we're all
dead see
yeah that's pretty much what the report
said we're we're all
we're all dead well michael sheldon
berger has a
a different opinion on that in terms of
the risk
who he agrees of course that humans are
a factor in climate change
and he agrees that things are getting
warmer and he agrees that there will be
you know weather disruptions
maybe as much as predicted but
here's what's different do you know how
many people have died from the heat
in let's say the last hundred years well
i don't know the number
but i know the number used to be really
big and that was really really small
because we have air conditioning as soon
as you invent air conditioning
it can get pretty warm outside people
live in the desert
it's really warm out there
but they use air conditioning seems to
be enough
likewise for almost everything that you
know would be a real world problem from
climate change
we're really good at mitigating things
we're good at predicting we're going to
moving
things we're good at communicating
transporting
you know planning managing we're good at
stuff now
not like the old days so indeed while
the planet might
indeed get way way worse and
certainly we should be addressing it
it's very unlikely it's going to make
any difference that you notice
but you need to scare people or they'll
all be dead
you only have two choices if you don't
scare people they won't do much about it
and presumably we just slide into some
bad situation where maybe we are all
doomed
but if you scare the pants off of enough
people
they'll do something about it and then
you'll probably be fine
so i'm very much in favor of scaring
other people
but i'm not sure how scared you need to
be
you and i don't need to be that scared
but the scientists
let's scare the scientists because
they'll work harder try to do something
about it
so here's my question
what happens to mass suicides and
depression
when your ipcc report comes out and
every news station
reports that we're doomed to die in a
fireball
now i'm exaggerating a little bit but it
sounds pretty bad right if you just read
the report
it sounds like our future is
non-existent
so what does that do to depressions and
suicides
well i'll tell you what i felt like i
felt like
taking my own life like actually
literally
when i read the report i was like okay
well there's no point
there's no point in even trying might as
well just go out and take your life
and it wasn't until i saw michael
schellenberger's tweet thread that i
retweeted so you can find it in my
twitter feed as well
then i started thinking oh okay they're
just doing this to me again
again scaring me again making it look
like
life is not worth living so thanks for
that
um apparently pfizer is maybe a few
weeks away from fda approval
for the vaccine uh and remember i asked
people if they'd be more likely to take
it
in a little twitter poll unscientific
one and a lot of people said yes
that if it was fda approved they would
take it
you know they have all the data already
right
did you know that they have all the data
for fda approval and they're telling you
that it's a few weeks away from approval
nobody is telling you nobody that it
might not get approved
right zero people have told you well
we're not sure if it'll get approved
because of the data
in fact the data very clearly says
apparently or i'm assuming it would be
reported if this were not the case
apparently the data says yeah it's good
it's good for approval
so it's probably just the paperwork and
the lawyering and stuff that's that's
going to take weeks
but if you knew that it was fda approved
effectively
even before it's officially approved
does that change your
willingness to get it fda approved
in you know in all the pre important
ways
because the data looks good all right
well a lot of you were not
uh holding off only for that reason but
i do think this will make a
pretty big dent in the number of people
get vaccinated i would imagine
um here's an this is more the uh
school of unintended consequences
all right the school of unintended
consequences
mask mandates
appear to be leading toward school
choice
because a number of uh you know state
school people are putting together plans
to say if
if masks are required then students
should be able to go
take their take their funding and go
to another place if they don't want to
be in a masked
situation now who saw that coming
not me if you had told me that masks
will accelerate in school choice
i would have said well i don't see how
exactly but
looks like it's going to happen looks
like that made a difference
well biden's approval is down a little
bit
so he was uh averaging you know in the
low
50 percent approval for his first six
months but now according to quinnipiac
he's down to 46 percent
and then sami is 43 percent blah blah
so he's down and approval and it appears
to be that the coronavirus
performance is the reason now
is biden responsible for the delta
variant
and where we are now not really i mean i
don't know that he could have done
something much
better if biden if
trump had been president what do you
think we would be looking at right now
better or worse probably about the same
probably about the same but here's the
weird thing
i do think trump lost because of the
virus
a lot of smart people say that and it
feels right because the virus caused a
lot of rule changes and
it was the rule changes that allowed the
kind of turnout we got
so really i'd say the virus determined
who the president is
is is really the first president ever
elected by a virus
well as far as i know so not only did
the virus elect
biden but now the virus is going to make
sure that biden
or probably his successor doesn't get
re-elected
or doesn't get elected so
do we have a system in which
people get informed and then vote and
choose
politicians or do we have a system in
which
a virus determines who's the president
because
that's what's happening the virus is
deciding
it's not even us and
i would like to point out that the war
against this virus
is going about as well as the war on
drugs
and the war in afghanistan
it's been a while since we won a war
has anybody noticed that the united
states and it's
warring not doing so good lately
yeah maybe maybe did a good job in syria
or something but
we're not really so good at winning wars
conclusively
are we yeah there's no money in winning
a war somebody says
it's a problem uh yeah calling
everything a war is probably
somebody says golf won
you know the first gulf war we won but
did we
if it just if it just led to problems
later
did we um
all right so let me go back to that
message
all right so mark dice did a video
which you just have to say i tweeted it
and it's on youtube in which he stopped
people and asked them to sign a petition
to put unvaccinated people in jail
to put unvaccinated people
in jail how many people signed the
petition
without a second thought
yeah just what you thought you don't
even have to watch the video do you
a lot of people sign that that petition
without a thought
they didn't do it without ask they did
it without asking questions
they did it without showing any second
thoughts
all they did was say well it's good for
me go to jail
it's good for me so why don't you go to
jail that's it
that's it
so um are you worried that we will
slide into prison camps for the
unvaccinated
are you worried i'm not worried about
that really
but it is true that you can get some
portion of the public
around 25 if you know what i mean to do
just about anything
without anything that looks like thought
i mean they actually look like
automatons
would you like to sign this petition to
kill everybody in your family
why not i don't see why not
it is really scary
oh the video is blinking i don't know if
it's blinking on anybody else's
screen yeah
female camps coming yeah
now you understand why people accepted
hitler you can accept
almost anything if it's gradual
and gradual doesn't have to be that
gradual right it just starts as
well you know this group of people
certainly is a problem
and then you can talk about that group
of people in a bad way and get away with
it and
next thing you know you're putting
little restrictions on that kind of
people the next thing you know it's a
holocaust
you can slide into anything you just get
used to it after a while
yeah it's the boiling frog situation
exactly and dehumanization well that's
about the scariest thing you'll ever see
but in terms of entertainment it's
really good
it's very entertaining so let's see what
we got here
that is just about all the news there is
and i didn't want to be all gloomy today
because
it's been pointed out to me that i've
been i've been less than my optimistic
self
by the way has anybody noticed that does
anybody think i've been less than my
optimistic self lately
uh yeah and
oh interesting there does seem to be a
mixture of opinions
about whether i've been less optimistic
lately you know i think that the
um the the trump
administration was an optimism-based
administration and it was easy to be you
know get swept up in that i think i was
now i still say the golden age is coming
uh and i do think things are better than
ever and will continue to be better than
ever
and we look at the fact that airlines
will become electric
i mean that's happening so a lot of the
things
you're worried about for climate change
um i i'm not sure so sure that that
makes a difference
i think that we will invent our way out
of climate change
and we will mitigate our way around it
and we'll be fine
but i'm glad that all the scientists and
engineers are worried
that way a little
that way that way they'll do the work
all right the most depressing thing is
the illegal immigration is it
is it because if you don't really have a
plan to
not get the virus and our hospitals are
not overrun
yet i mean there's some places that they
got real problems apparently in the
south
but i don't know you know if you see
lots of
whatever you see pictures of and talk
about will seem like your biggest
problem
what are the odds yeah so here's an
experiment for you
think about uh your own life right now
just think about yourself personally
okay think about yourself just your life
the things that will affect you
personally what are the odds that you
personally as a resident of the united
states
if you are one of the odds that you will
be affected in a negative way by
immigration
it can happen right but right now you
could probably get a job just about
anywhere
because there's more job openings than
jobs
so it doesn't affect your employment at
the moment it does affect
that you can get services and goods from
people
willing to provide them that are maybe
here illegally
um but one of the odds that you will
have a worse life
like personally it's not really that
high
no i see crime right but what are the
odds of you personally
will be a victim of a crime from an
illegal immigrant just personally
now i'm not saying that you should i'm
in favor of a tight border
just to be clear i'm in favor of tight
borders
for all the obvious reasons but the odds
that you personally
will be victimized by an immigrant
in some direct way i'm seeing people say
a hundred percent
i guess depending on where you live that
could be true if you lived on the border
you there's 100 chance you would be
affected in some way probably negatively
but if you're not living right on the
border
it probably won't affect you at all
probably won't
maybe a little inflation i don't know
maybe your health care goes up or down
i don't know uh but the truth is you
probably did not even notice
so very much like climate change climate
change might be the biggest problem in
the world
it might be but it probably won't affect
you
you probably you probably won't know the
difference you could probably go through
your life just
doing what you do and live your whole
life and
scientists and engineers and the
government will take care of the climate
change and you'll just buy products that
are more
you know more energy efficient and
that's all you'll do
who speaks for the earth well
yeah the earth has some issues so
my biggest problem is taxes uh debt is a
problem but we don't know how much
so i think that we'll uh we'll figure
our way through this
have you noticed that under the biden
administration
are you worse off probably you could
do some statistical stuff to find out
that you are
gas is more expensive yeah gas is more
expensive
but how about your specific life do you
think it's worse off than if you've been
under trump
well i don't know i mean you can make a
good argument for it
and the partisans will say yeah trump
would be better
might be right but it's probably not
that much
right because every day i wake up
i do this you know i eat i sleep i
exercise
it feels a lot the same
i i don't know i can't think of anything
that's different
besides the fact that i'm bored i mean
i'm bored by biden he just bores the
crap out of me
but besides that i don't know my life
looks pretty much the same the pandemic
probably would have been the same under
under trump
oh ammunition prices yeah i guess that's
going up
but um scott you do not reflect the
population
you are correct you are correct
but it is true the people who want jobs
can get them
and that your odds of dying from some
new crisis
whether it's a corroded virus or climate
change is very small
for any one person very very small
and yeah inflation's definitely a
problem
definitely a problem all right um
yeah inflation is probably the biggest
problem that has a direct effect on
people
i'll give you that inflation is the
biggest problem
and i do think that trump would have
been maybe better on that
but we still had to spend our way out of
the pandemic
so i think there was going to be
inflation no matter what
um
all right can't get a job if i won't
take the
vaccine yeah well that's
your free market working for you there
um oh you're now deemed a racist so yes
yeah i guess that's worse if you've been
deemed a racist but you would have been
anyway
uh why is oil not going up
maybe it already did
all right um so
i'm seeing a lot of comments here about
sunspots
if let me tell you oh god i just said
the locals platform just crashed
somebody said it's doing it every 28
minutes
oh yeah it's right it did it exactly in
28 minutes
that is correct interesting so it's a 28
minute timer it looks like
on the locals platform but it comes
right back on
all right so it does look like there's a
28 minute uh
timer on the locals platform and it
times out
anyway sunspots if you think those
sunspots
are are the thing controlling climate
change you're probably not operating at
a high level
of understanding or or knowledge that's
that's the sort of problem you have if
you do your own research you know i
always make fun of people doing their
own research
because we're not qualified i
you know i've got two college degrees
and spent a lot of time doing a lot of
data analytics and stuff i'm not
qualified
you know you're not either to do your
own research but i'll tell you one thing
that is the
least likely thing to be true the least
likely thing to be true is as sun spots
are the
the hidden cause of climate change that
is the
least likely thing of anything about
climate change it's the least likely to
be true i suppose anything could be true
you know you could be wrong or i could
be wrong about anything
and the reason is because it's so
obvious as a thing to check
it has been checked extensively and the
people who are
you know the consensus of experts say
there's absolutely nothing there
but you can find all over the internet
less credible people saying oh it's the
sunspots and here's my data and here's
my chart
and they're all just so yes you
have seen
lots of data and charts telling you some
spots are the real cause
i will bet let's see
i don't know there's a real way to bet
on this because maybe we'll never know
the real answer in a way that people
will agree
but i was uh just think of the setup
all of the scientists have heard this
theory about sunspots
all of them they've all heard it now
you're saying to yourself
scott if somebody proves climate change
is not real
they would lose their job and all that
now if somebody proved that sunspots
were the cause of climate change and
actually proved it
they would be the most lauded and famous
scientist
of all time they would be like the
wright brothers they would bully like
einstein
their name would be famous forever they
would write best-selling books they
would be invited to talk
you couldn't get richer than proving
sunspots were the cause of climate
change
and it hasn't happened there is enormous
financial incentive to show that some
spots or anything else
causes climate change now i know what
you're saying oh these scientists don't
want to buck
the buck the mainstream
but bucking the mainstream in terms of
questioning all their data
would be really dangerous but showing
your own data
that doesn't question anybody else's
it's just your own data
hey look i found out that the sunspots
are causing all this
you would be the most famous scientist
in the country
it would be a ticket to wealth and i
think anybody would know that
there are there are types of things you
can't disagree with let's say evolution
if you came out with a scientific theory
that said evolution was bunk
you'd be dead uh you know your career
would be if you came out and said we've
measured yeah take the tony heller
example
if you came out and said we've measured
it wrong you're dead
you can't you'll never get away with
that if you said
uh all our ice core samples are wrong
you're dead
if you say that the uh the
sea level rise we we measured it wrong
and the models are wrong so it's not
really going to happen
you're dead but if you said that i did a
study all by myself
and i found that sunspots were causing
all the problems you'd be rich
you'd be famous but your study would
have to hold up
right it'd have to be reproducible it's
of course but yeah
no you if you dealt with somebody else's
data
your career is over but if you come up
with your own new thing
that just can stand alone and explain
everything else
yeah somebody do that so i don't think
there's any chance that scientists
haven't looked
at it thoroughly and they're the right
people to look at it and they just
haven't found no correlation so anything
you see on the internet that says there
is a correlation
is i would bet
uh well you can't really bet on it
because nobody will ever agree
agree on the conclusion ever anytime
all right um
so let me ask you this if
sunspots are the cause then they should
be able to predict
isn't that right because can't we
predict sunspots
or am i wrong about that so you should
be able to make a sunspot related
prediction about what the climate will
be doing in five years
that would be more accurate than
the ipcc and if you could do that then
maybe you'd have something
but uh i wouldn't worry that
that's likely i would say the least
likely
of all the possibilities is that
sunspots are doing it and we had no and
science hadn't noticed
it's the least likely possibility but
maybe you know anything's possible
um the mini ice age the monitor minimum
yeah none of that's real
all of that stuff's been studied and
debunked thoroughly
there's no money tied to sunspots but
there is
i just told you there is if if an
individual scientist or a team of them
could prove that the sunspots were the
real cause of climate change
they would be rich if you doubt that you
don't understand
anything about anything but the study
would have to hold up
i mean that's the catch right if they
just say it's true and it isn't
you don't have much there um
yeah the worst phrase ever is the
science it says because science doesn't
say anything
people say stuff and the news tells you
stuff
but science actually is silent um
yeah i know somebody says there's no
money in fixing it if it doesn't exist
but that doesn't change the fact that
the scientist would still have a huge
financial incentive to find
that sunspots were the real reason if
they were so you should assume they're
not
all right that's all i have to do today
and i will talk to you
tomorrow youtubers see you then
