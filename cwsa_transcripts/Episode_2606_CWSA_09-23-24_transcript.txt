well that's funny I was going to put the
books back in my shelf but I don't know
where I put
them there would be books on those
shelves if I knew where they
were let's get some locals comments
going all the special people on locals
come
on we're going to have a show like
you've never seen
today
maybe you never
[Music]
know good morning everyone and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
that's called coffee with Scott Adams
you've never had a better time and if
you'd like to take your enjoyment up to
levels that no one could possibly
comprehend with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need for that is a cuper
muger glass a tanker gels Orin a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope meat here
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
ah man I can feel that all the way down
to my mitochondria and I don't even know
what a mitochondria
is well let's start with some science
news and before we get into the politics
there's a study according to science
alert that says that owning a cat could
double your schizophrenia risk huh now
they do say it's not necess necessarily
causal it could be just a
correlation but let's dig a little bit
deeper let's see what would
schizophrenia mean well that would mean
emotional blunting delusions and
hallucinations huh I wonder if I can tie
this topic to politics in any way
emotional blunting
delusions
hallucinations
hoaxes
hoaxes fake news
MSNBC so there's not really a huge
difference between having
schizophrenia and watching MSNBC and
thinking it's
real I mean there is a difference there
not like a giant
difference so let's see the other thing
that would be a tip that there might be
some connection with politics is if
there was something about cat
owners that we
knew what do we know about cat owners
well let's see I checked this statistic
and 58% of cat owners are
women
H so only a cat can make you hallucinate
and be delusional and emotionally
blunted and most cat owners are
women and most Harris supporters are
women who own
cats who would make them hallucinate
that Trump is going to steal their
democracy there pulled it all together I
bet you didn't think I could bring that
one home did you yeah pulled it all
together no I don't believe necessarily
that cats are giving anybody any
schizophrenia but it's not a giant
coincidence that the people who support
Harris have a lot of
cats maybe that's just a coincidence you
never
know um if you would like to know more
about most of my
sciencey related uh topics you should
follow Owen Gregorian on X sounds it's
spelled just the way it looks Owen
Gregorian so I get a lot of my uh
especially the sciencey tips from Owen
so follow Owen for
more did you know that the fewer than
50% of the students in Washington state
are at grade level in science science
and math according to the post
millennial fewer than
50% huh now wouldn't it be great if the
writer of that story was really good at
math because it's a story about other
people who were bad at math you know it
would be awkward if the person who wrote
the story about other people being bad
at
math didn't really connect all the dots
with the math cuz within this story
about the public schools being way bad
at science and math and maybe worse than
they have ever been in the same
article uh it says that the Washington
state has the highest Private School
attendance so in Washington state nearly
25% of the K through 12ers are in a
private
school do you think that's
related if you saw this story just the
headline you'd say to yourself whoa
those schools used to be bad but they're
getting worse at a faster level now it
might be that they're getting worse but
what would happen if you took any public
school and then you took 25% of the best
students and move them to private
schools what would happen to the average
of the people who are
left it doesn't mean they're doing worse
it just means who's
left am I wrong
it who who are the kids who go to
private school CU it cost more it's not
the dumb ones the dumb ones are not
being pulled out a public school and put
in in expensive private schools It's
usually the Richer smarter
kids so if you took the Richer smarter
kids out of the public
school that alone would drop the number
of you know people who were good at
their school by a
lot so I would suggest that this is a a
little more complicated it could be that
what's happening is that the public
schools are so bad that they have the
highest number of people trying to get
out of them so that could be what's
happening the other possibility is that
Washington state is lucky and that has
the most school
choice because school choice could get
you to the same place except that it
would be a positive story about
education in other words the high
percentage of private School uh students
could be telling us that Washington
state is producing the best trained
students in the
country but if you were to look at the
headline you'd say whoa they might be
producing some of the worst students in
the country and that's because if you're
just looking at the public school you
you're missing out that they have the
highest percentage of private school and
that's got to be a big part of the
math meanwhile the UAE
uh they're going big on indoor Farms
because they're a desert so they need
indoor Farms otherwise they have to ship
stuff in from far away which is
expensive so there's a company called
Pure Harvest Farms looking for more
funding to expand but here's the part
that I found interesting I'm going to
make you all interested in indoor
farming that's my goal my goal is simply
to make you interested in indoor farming
because because if you get interested
then other people get interested and it
spreads and then it's easier to get them
funded it just becomes sexier so I'm
going to make indoor farming the sexiest
thing in the country so here are a few
things we know so you're all
smart did you know that the indoor Farm
could lower your water usage by up to
95% in some cases so maybe 80% would be
more reasonable but imagine if you could
reduce by 80
% what you need for
Farming Farming is what sucks up most of
your water we have this big old water
problem in
California it's largely the farming but
indoor farming could solve that what
about fertilizer we're running out of
fertilizer and plus you don't want a lot
of fertilizer on your food well indoor
Farms use less or I think it could use
none if you have a controlled
environment I think you can get down to
none but I'm not sure you might need
some what about
Labor well in the short run labor
probably would be similar you know
whether it's indoors or out because it
would take a human to walk around and
pick stuff but what happens if the
robots are doing all the the work seems
to me that an indoor robot would be much
cheaper than an outdoor robot for one
thing you could optimize the robot for
the exact configuration that would be
very predictable but also it won't be um
sitting out out outside getting
ruined because I can't figure out what
would be worse for anything than sitting
out in the elements so you could save
money on labor when you got your robots
you could uh save money
on oh oh so the negative so these are
the
negatives um you need uh to construct
it I think that one of the big um future
advances will be modular indoor
Farms because right now you know it
would take some money to build an indoor
Farm but how much money would it take to
build like
segments so that you could just buy as
many segments as you need to make it as
long as you want and it's just delivered
on a truck and there's not much putting
it together
I feel like you could take the cost of
construction of the indoor Farm down by
80% you know with mass production and
more modular kind of stuff maybe
80% what about uh let's see how about
the
uh oh what about the
shipping if you can put the food closer
to the people you can get rid of a whole
bunch of refrigeration time and you
don't have to gas the vegetables so they
look good um because you just grow them
until they're ready and then people eat
them within hours so you've got this big
Transportation advantage of course you
need
power uh but you could use solar I
suppose I think indoor Farms are the
future especially for newly built
designed
cities have you heard of anybody saying
boy you know what you should try is Ias
it's some kind of very
dangerous uh hallucinogen now I say very
dangerous because that's the nature of
the story I'm going to tell you I don't
know how dangerous it is I'm no doctor
some people say it's not so dangerous
but there's some new evidence that maybe
it is but one of the stories we're
hearing this is anecdotal at this point
is that a number of uh CEOs of startups
they go when they have their hallucinate
hallucination uh experience with iasa
that's supposed to change your brain
forever to be I don't know happier or
more productive or something but that
they uh once they come back from their
iasa experience they quit their
jobs so it turns out that it makes you
not care about chasing after the
billionth dollar I guess so there's some
concern that as the CEO is become
happier and more well balanced through
some kind of a hallucinogenic experience
that they're not as
hungry and so they're not chasing
success and that that might hurt hurt
the Silicon Valley I don't know I don't
know if that's a big problem to worry
about but Ashley Vance was talking about
that I thought I'd pass
along but in related news according to
new Atlas psilocybin you know that would
be the the mushroom related
hallucinations uh they tested it
compared to the normal meds for
depression the ssris and what do you
think worked better well I wouldn't be
telling you if it were the
ssris so not only did they get uh
similarly great
results but that the mushroom people had
longer lasting positive benefits in
their life so basically it wasn't
close if you believe this one study that
wasn't superpowered and wasn't uh it
wasn't a gold standard study so use your
judgment but when studies agree with me
I like to tell you about them because
that's the best you can do just find
stuff that agrees with you and pretend
it's credible that's what I do that's
what you should do
too according to slay
news um Trump has more favorable ratings
than uh among voters than Taylor Swift
now remember that's among voters so it
might not be that there are more people
who like
Trump it's just that a lot of young
people who can't vote might be the
Taylor Swift fans so it's it's kind of
close but there is a difference and uh
Trump is a little bit more favorable
than Taylor Swift so number of you said
is Trump being stupid and crazy and uh
you know being being chaotic or
something because he said I hate Taylor
Swift and people said no don't don't
offend Taylor Swift's um fans that's bad
for politics and I
said I'm not so sure that's bad for
politics because I wasn't sure at the
time if there were more people who
disliked her than liked her but he may
have played that right so his comments
his anti uh Taylor Swift
comments may have actually gained them
votes you know I doubt it because I I
think people have mostly decided but it
didn't hurt him I don't think I heard
him at
all well I keep following the story
about Chicago where the old gang members
the existing gangs are mad at the new
gangs so the new gangs of the
Venezuelans pretty tough and uh so not
only did Chicago ship in a whole bunch
of violent new gangs
but they decided their local government
decided to turn off shot spotter now
shot spotter is a technology that they
put in cities where they've got uh
listening devices and they can hear
where there's uh
gunfire and if it's uh presumably
unauthorized gunfire because it's in the
city um then the police can immediately
dispatch and they know where to go
because they know where the gunfire came
from so that used to be in effect and
they just turned it
off so they shipped in new gangs and
then they turned off the shot
spotter does anybody see any problems
coming the gangs are just going to shoot
it
out I think they found a way to get rid
of the original gangs by bringing in you
know better armed more violent
gangs I don't know that there are two
ways to take over territory
the only way I know of if you want to be
the the drug dealer of choice in a
certain block of the city I think you
have to kill the people who are already
there I'm not recommending it just to be
clear I don't recommend it don't kill
anybody don't be violent I'm just saying
I'm not aware of a second
method so if if the new criminals are
coming in and the shot spot is turned
off and probably the police have been
defunded I don't know if that's true but
it feels like it fit the story um I feel
like they just gave up on
Chicago they just gave
up anyway good luck Chicago if you live
there I would
recommend you should get out get out get
away um I saw Joshua
lysek who I worked with on uh my books
still working with on my books and uh
he's an editor Ghost Writer very
successful and he noted uh on X that
YouTube has been artificially limiting
my live streams and he showed the he
showed the page of all my live streams
and they they had 31,000 they just
stopped no matter what my topic is or no
matter what's happening in the world
31,000 and we're done here uh we're done
here now do you do you think that my
numbers could be
31,000 pretty much every day does that
does that sound real to
you I don't think so you should see my
Instagram
numbers my Instagram numbers are also
flat forever not that I do much on
Instagram so you're not missing anything
there but I don't I don't think it's an
accident doesn't it look like exactly
what it is
I don't know yeah what I'd be interested
in is if my live stream audience uh
differs a
lot because if the live stream audience
goes way up and way down that would
suggest that there's some capping going
on but if my live stream audience who
are sort of well trained to know where
it is and when it comes on if that's
going all over the place but my total
number is flat
that would raise an eyebrow so I'm going
to say it seems most likely that I'm
capped now would you call that rigging
in
election of course you would of course
that's rigging in election if it's true
now I can't say it's true I'm just
looking at the numbers and saying well
it would be one heck of a coincidence if
it was always the same number and nobody
else ever has had that experience
so give that what I mostly talk about is
politics and mostly it's leaning in One
Direction if you cap that what does what
does that do to an
election well in theory it should it
should uh influence it and it should
influence it in a way that is unstated
and somewhat secretive even though it
seems obvious we don't know for sure
cannot confirm that that's what's
happening because the other possibility
is amazing coincidence a gigantic
amazing
coincidence Could Happen coincidences do
happen or maybe they have some other
explanation about monetization or
something else but well I looks kind of
looks kind of sketchy to
me apparently I was trending this
morning on X over that
topic um so remember uh Trump the other
day said to some Jewish group he was
talking to that uh quote any Jewish
person that votes for her meaning Harris
especially now should have their head
examined um he said that if he loses it
will be the fault of Jewish voters
according to Jake Tapper so Jake Tapper
was talking to Tom codon who didn't
really take the
bait but here's what I would say if you
want to judge whether you
should um say that Trump is being
somehow anti-Semitic
replace Jews in this story with any
other
group and it works for every group if
you were talking to a women's group and
he said if I lose and women didn't vote
for me enough you're going to feel bad
about it it's going to be your fault and
then he goes to the next group and says
all right black
Americans if you don't vote for me and I
lose you're going to feel bad it's going
to be on you then goes to the next group
said all senior citizens if you don't
make it to the vote it's going to be on
you
now am I wrong that it works for every
group all it is is normal
talking well normal for Trump he's
basically saying here's the upside
here's the downside the upside is
terrific the downside is terrible and
you're going to feel bad if you're part
of the downside what part of that
exactly is
anetic now you might say bcot he only
said it to the
Jews to which I
say
so there there's probably lots of things
he only said once to one group or put it
in a certain way I don't think it means
anything and and I would be
hardpressed um to find an actual living
human being who said you know what I was
personally offended by that but watching
the news CNN in this case try to turn it
into something is clearly a nothing I
mean Trump could not be more pro-jewish
American and more pro-israel than
anybody you've ever seen in your life so
it's the stupidest weakest attack and
it's it's lame and it's
disgusting and uh you know but Jake
Tapper so there you go and it's a
political
season well apparently uh there's some
thinking I think this was in the hill
that Senate Democrats are worried that
pollsters maybe they might be
undercounting the Trump
voters what do you think of that that's
crazy isn't it crazy crazy the thought
that the pollsters might be
undercounting the Trump voters I mean
what would be behind that other than the
Express intent to not answer pollsters
and the fact that we saw it in 2016 and
we saw it in 2020 and every single time
that's looked at the Trump supporters
are
undercounted so what would make you
think it's going to happen again just
because it happened every
time I mean come on where is your
reasoning just because it happened every
time what makes you think it's going to
happen
again well p recognition
maybe um there's a uh article by Doug
Douglas
McKinnon and uh he was saying that uh
the workingclass voters are the scared
voter majority he noted that the
workingclass people are more frightened
of their economic future than any time
he can remember and that they're Trump
supporters by nature meaning that
they're leaning toward Trump as the
solution to their economic plight and uh
that they may they may be under
underappreciated just how angry they are
or scared I think scared is the the uh
proper term that Douglas was using so
let me ask you this you're sitting on
your couch sometimes you remember to
vote and sometimes you don't sometimes
you care sometimes you don't you're kind
of a sometimes
voter but this time
you're
scared you're actually scared are you
more likely to vote
Yes so I'm not sure that you can measure
likelihood to vote when a gigantic swath
of potential Trump voters are the most
frightened they've ever been at least
you know after the Depression I suppose
um about
Harris now the the potential for them to
be undercounted is pretty high because I
don't think anybody in the media has any
sense the pulse of just how angry and
scared they are so that could be a
surprise coming could
be um there are new polls that came out
today that are all over the place some
of them saying Harris is up and some of
them saying that Trump is up but uh
here's one that feels like uh
foreshadowing uh this is a new poll by
the Sienna New York Times now you might
know that the New York Times is not pro
Trump and the last time they uh looked
at Arizona and pulled it they said
Harris was up by
five now you might say to yourself well
really up five in Arizona I mean if you
follow the the the Battleground States
at all you know that that's sort that
would be a
shocking kind of weird result up
five well they have a new result they
say now Trump's up
five so they went from Harris up five to
Trump up
five 10 basis point
swing what how's that
happen do you do you think that that
many people changed their
minds since the last time they pulled
no they didn't what's
different how about North Carolina it
went from Harris was up to to Trump is
up to four point
swing and uh they've got Trump ahead by
four in Georgia now it's important to
know that there are current polls that
are very different from this but the New
York Times is not a prot trump poll so
they're they're not they're not cooking
the books to help him
so why do you
think that they
reversed so
blatantly do you think any other
pollsters are going to find that maybe
their prior answers were a little bit
off do you think that when I predicted a
year ago and all the smart people
predicted a year ago that the polls over
the summer would be completely
fake and they would be meant to create a
certain voting
pattern and that when we got close to
the actual election which would be
October coming right up that the polls
would
tighten and would the polls tighten
because the
voters would tighten in their opinions
no I never said that I said the polls
would tighten because they were a fake
and they need to become more real when
you get to the actual election so so
that when everybody grades them the only
thing they will be graded on is how they
did on the day of the
election everything else they can say
well it was true over the summer but
then people change their opinions so we
just caught up with their changing
opinions and everything's credible don't
worry about it yeah everything's fine we
didn't change our methodology yeah just
maybe people change their minds but in
fact we expect that they will change
their
methodologies could it be that the
Sienna New York Times has decided to get
a ahead of it and they went
early what do you think do you think
there's any change in their
methodology I don't know one way or the
other but how do you get this much of a
swing when there wasn't you know much
that happened that should have changed
the polling
H so I'm going to say keep an eye on
this space if in the next week or two
you see another one like this where huh
it really went from one direction to the
other kind of quickly and I don't see
anything in the news that would have
caused
that look for
that
anyway here's another little uh sign
Colin rugs talking about this on X
there's a Democrat mayor who's a Muslim
and he's a mayor in hem TR in Michigan
now it's a smallish city um but uh it's
notable because he's a Democrat and he's
a Muslim and he's in politics and he is
announced he's endorsing Donald
Trump in 2021 they elected they were the
first nation and the the first city in
the nation to have an all Muslim city
council so were talking about a place
that politically is very Muslim and the
mayor who's a
Democrat just endorse
Trump what's going on
here have you noticed that
um is sort of hilarious the uh the
endorsements that Harris is
getting so instead of getting the
Teamsters Union which would be you a
nice really meaty solid endorsement they
decided H maybe we won't endorse anybody
we always seems like we always do the
Democrats at least for the last few
decades but maybe you just won't do one
this time well that's pretty bad but
don't worry because she did get the
Cheney
endorsement
oh and she got the IRS
endorsement wait
what we we're a country that was
literally founded on um dumping tea in
the harbor because we didn't want to pay
taxes
so
anyway um I've got a feeling that uh and
do you remember the story of the there
was a CBS reporter who went to a bunch
of restaurants in one of the
Battleground States and could only find
one person in each restaurant there was
a Harris supporter and everybody else
was Trump and then you look at the polls
and it looked about
even but is that because Democrats don't
go to
restaurants like what why is it that the
anecdotal stuff is so far off the data
consistently I wonder what that is
what's that all about then you look at
the fact that people are wearing Maga
hats in public that they've never been
able to do before what's that all about
know one of the the uh BS filters that I
teach you is when observation doesn't
match the science now what you shouldn't
do is assume that the observation is
somehow scientific proof it's
not but if your observation violently
disagrees with the data you should start
asking some questions and I always use
the same example the data says that
smoking cigarettes can give you lung
cancer and sure enough I observe across
my entire life that I only know one
person who died of lung cancer who was
not a smoker everybody else was a smoker
so that fits anecdote science perfect
got
it but why did the polls say that the
election is close but every time you
talk to a group of people that doesn't
look that
way shouldn't there be also some man
does where somebody went somewhere and
everybody was just accidentally a Harris
supporter have you seen the work I can't
remember maybe you'll tell me in the
comments uh gentleman whose last name is
suruga suugo I think I'm butchering that
so in the comments if you you'll know
who I'm talking about when I mention it
so on X there's a some expert who has
some equipment and allegedly they can go
a uh comml Harris rally and they can
determine how many of the people who
have been to that rally had been to
Prior rallies because they would use the
same equipment at various rallies and uh
they seem to determine that a huge
percentage of the people who attend to
rallies have attended prior rallies in
very different places meaning that they
would have to be bused in or drive in
and that they would be essentially
professional
attendees now I don't know if there's
something like that with Trump
supporters because I wouldn't be
surprised if it's like the Grateful Dead
you know that both candidates have
people who maybe just travel around
because they they love the environment
you know maybe they just love how it
feels so there could be some correlation
that everybody has this but it's being
reported as a Harris specific
thing so there again I don't I don't
know the uh accuracy of the claims I
don't know if the equipment does what
it's supposed to do but again these are
anecdotal
so everybody who's looking for the
groundbased support of Harris doesn't
find it everybody let me say it again
everybody who looks for it in just the
population the public they don't find it
but the polls
do so
what's going
on now uh I remind you again don't
believe the anecdotal over the data but
don't believe data in general because
most of our data is motivated and fake
for everything motivated and
fake Trump said at a uh some event he
was at just yesterday now I think he was
sort of joking or maybe
testing this didn't sound like it was
yet serious but it does suggest that the
idea is in his head and Trump said this
in public uh about crypto he said maybe
we'll pay the $35 trillion debt in
crypto now may I invite the NPC's to
weigh in if you're an NPC what you
should say now is Scott Scott he doesn't
understand you you can't just print
extra Bitcoins Bitcoin does not work
that way and then you would mansplain
Bitcoin to me even though Bitcoin is not
the topic because he said
crypto which is all the cryptos he did
not say Bitcoin so if you're an NPC you
must be obsessed with how this doesn't
apply to bitcoin and you should school
me on it I'm already seeing people
jumping into the comments on a to do
that Scott apparently you don't
understand how Bitcoin works
to which I say commenter apparently you
don't understand what the topic is
because it's not about Bitcoin so let's
get that out of the way NPCs you're
still welcome to join in but now we all
know who you are so please explain how
you can't just print some more Bitcoins
We Know It We Know It All right but the
other
cryptos could have different nature so
Bitcoin is special it's the one that's
limited you could say a algorithmically
limited mathematically limited limited
by formula I don't know what would be
the correct programmatically
limited but you you can't just make more
you can mine it and they get harder and
harder to find the more you find but you
can't just make
one anyway is Trump's uh statement maybe
we will pay the 35 trillion debt in
crypto serious or non-serious
here is my best guess and I can't read
his mind so I'm not going to try to read
his mind but if I were him I'll just do
it this way if I were him this is what I
would do I would throw it out there and
just see what people said I've told you
this before the there's the Hollywood
concept for
brainstorming uh the Hollywood concept
is I call it the bad idea you know I
didn't make this up it came to me when I
worked a little bit in Hollywood um the
bad idea is you think there's a good
idea that could be had but you don't
have it you just know it might be maybe
over in this area so the bad idea is the
idea that just puts your brain in that
area and so okay here's the bad version
so the bad version is we pay off the
debt with Bitcoin and then somebody says
no no no that doesn't work that way you
can't just print extra Bitcoins that
would just be inflationary and then
somebody else says but wait a minute
suppose suppose we did this or suppose
we did that and then it wasn't obvious
but finally somebody smart enough says
you know there is one and only one way
you could make this work it's if you do
this this and that and then you've got a
solution now do I think that there's a
crypto solution to the $35 trillion in
debt not that I know of but I did this
same thing most of you saw uh few months
ago I was asking the same question again
not not about Bitcoin but I was asking
the same question is there a
path where you could just convert the
debt into crypto and you could say to
the people who uh have hold the debt
we're going to pay you back it's just
going to be in crypto now you might say
to yourself wait Scot that would be
disruptive and have all these problems
and you'd be right but remember I'm not
giving you a solution I'm just taking
your brain to an area where if there's
somebody smarter who could just see
around a corner better than I can maybe
you see something then you tell me so
I'm not telling you what the idea is I'm
trying to Prime you so there's somebody
smarter who can tell me what the idea is
is there a crypto play I think
maybe I here's the thing I can smell it
but I can't see it and this is something
that creative people experience maybe
more than other people I don't know so
being a creator for a living you know I
I literally create several things a day
of commercial value um you can
usually sense I'll say smell but you can
sense that there's something there long
before you know what it is have you had
that experience so I can tell you that I
sent there's something there but I
definitely don't see it there there's no
part of my logic or my knowledge about
the area that that could connect the
dots yeah um I'm seeing in the comments
from uh Adam that uh Trump has one thing
going for him that most maybe all
politicians don't have that he's willing
to put a crazy idea into out into the
public just see what happens you know he
got criticized for
allegedly I don't know if this even
happened um bringing up the idea of
nuking hurricanes when they were young
so that they didn't turn into full
hurricanes now that turned into when it
became public if it really happened we
don't know if it really happened but it
when it became public that allegedly
said that people said my goodness that's
the worst idea in the world to which I
say I don't think you understand what
that
was that was
this that was I'm going to throw out an
idea that I'm pretty sure is
terrible but is there somebody else who
could tell me how to make it work for
example you know you wouldn't want to
Nuke something and have all the you know
the nuclear waste doing all the things
it does but what if what if somebody
said you know what if you caught it
early enough you could use a mother of
all bomb and it's not
even it's not even um nuclear
now I don't think that's an answer I
don't think that a mother of B bomb
would be big enough to stop a hurricane
but then somebody else would say well
wait a minute we're talking about
stopping
hurricanes I've got an
idea my idea is if we're even in the
topic of stopping hurricanes let's
forget the bomb and let's go to uh the
Sahara Desert and well the desert is
part of Northern Africa and let's work
really hard at planting trees and
reforesting it
because it turns out that the
temperature difference in the deserts of
Northern Africa are are so different
than the temperatures in other places
that that's what causes the wind to
start moving fast so if you could change
the temperature
differential you could actually stop
hurricanes or you could lessen them
because it' be less differential in temp
temperature and that probably would work
like it'd be expensive and it' take a
while but you could actually maybe stop
hurricanes that came from that One
Direction so that's the way I see
Trump's ideas that sound crazy I think
he lived in the real world and he's also
lived in the Hollywood world what do you
learn when you live in the Hollywood
World remember he had a his show on TV
surrounded by the same people I was
surrounded by when I worked in the you
know La Hollywood world for the dilber
TV show do you think he's ever heard the
idea or been in the room when it
happened that somebody threw out the bad
idea because that's where it comes from
it's like a Hollywood thing you throw
out the bad idea to get to the good idea
but if he takes that and he's standing
next to a military General and he says
the bad idea why don't we nuke a
hurricane is the military General going
to say well there's a man who knows how
to make people think more deeply about
things I I'm not going to take the
nuclear part too seriously but let me
let me really focus on are there any
solutions to stop a hurricane before it
gets
going so you can see how the rumor would
start but you could also see that the
smarter people are asking the dumbest
questions let let me give you another
dumb like really dumb here's a dumb one
we keep sending Rockets into space but
then the rocket itself gets wasted like
it just falls in the
ocean so is there any way for the rocket
to just
land oh you idiot you idiot have you
ever seen a
rocket let let me explain this to you
okay so your rocket is this tall thing
as falling through space it's not going
to land upright that's not a thing
it's
crazy except that that's why Elon musma
made
work let me say
this let me trade out the
general all right so let's go back to
where allegedly again I'm not even sure
it happened but allegedly Trump said in
front of a general could we nuke a
hurricane now let's just replace the
general and it's Elon Musk and he's
walking with Trump and Trump says you
think we could just nuke a
hurricane what does Elon mus say does he
say oh I can't we wait to leak this
about this idiot like the general did
who should be fired immediately no Elon
Musk would say I don't think that'll
work because the
radiation but you know what there are
some ideas floating
around maybe now that's what I think
you'd say obviously I can't predict what
somebody who smart smarter than me would
say right the the dumbest thing you can
do is try to predict what someone who's
smarter than you would do in a given
situation so I I can't predict what Elon
Musk could do let's let's all agree on
that but the point is if you put a
creative person in the same conversation
suddenly it turns into a
solution if you put one creative person
who tosses on an idea and the other one
is a War General whose job is to make
sure you don't get too creative you know
kind of kind of use the stuff that
works you get a whole different
story all
right so I like his uh I like Trump's uh
throwing out the idea of paying off the
debt even though I don't know any way
that it could possibly
work Harris is going to unveil her own
Economic Policy this week according to
Reuters um do you think that's going to
help her or hurt her
because I've got a feeling that um
Harris's economic policy is going to
sound so much like
trumps and she's going to have to like
leave out reparations
and um you know Mass transfers of wealth
from one to the other I don't really
know where she's going to land on any of
this but I don't think it's going to
help um it could be if the fake news
gives it a big boost and they'll fawn
over it that's enough because most
people don't understand economics if you
knew nothing about economics and you
turned on
MSNBC and you saw um Joe scarel talking
about Comm Harris's Next
plan well it would look like uh Jeffrey
tubin on the zoom call except that he
would be screaming in more complimentary
terms about this economic policy and so
you're just flipping through the
channels and you see scarb oh oh that's
the best economic plan oh oh I've never
seen anything like this
oh you're going to say to yourself well
he probably looked into it I mean he
seems to like it and these other people
on this show that I think his news seem
to like it so it could be that all they
need is some fodder for the fake news to
sell and it doesn't matter if it's good
or bad or IND different because the
public can't tell the difference between
a good idea and a bad idea they're going
to have lots of stuff on tariffs
oh here here's the awkward
part Trump I think does a bad uh job of
explaining
tariffs but it is true that both
Democrats and Republicans keep tariffs
in place when it makes sense and they
don't do tariffs when it doesn't make
sense and what both of them try to sell
is that you know it makes sense what
Trump would say and then the other the
other team says but it does doesn't make
sense if you use in these other contexts
which he's not using it so the time to
use a tariff is when you're protecting
your whole Market from an attack from
another country where they're
artificially lowering their prices and
the government is supporting them in the
other country so that they come in and
basically bankrupt all the American
companies in that
business we don't want
that that's not exactly Fair competition
if the only thing that's happening is
we're competing they're competing but
there's a little
cheaper well maybe the Tariff doesn't
make sense in that case but what's
Harris going to do the Biden
Administration has tariffs in place
which were Trump's tariffs and they
could they could take them off anytime
they wanted the reason they don't take
him off is that they agree with
tariffs indeed I think pretty much all
economists agree with them if the
context is protecting an entire market
and then I think I think most economists
would disagree if you're just T you know
just throwing a tariff on for no reason
I think they disagree with that but
we're not doing
that so um anyway I I think the Harris
economic plan is going to be a study in
fake news the fake news is really going
to have a hard time hiding the fact that
she's copying Trump on everything that
matters and the things that where she's
not copying him are never going to
happen but that might be enough because
if people like Trump's economic policies
and then she seems to be triangulating
more toward them that might be enough
for some normal Democrats to say well I
was worried that she might be a
communist but that looks pretty
capitalist so good enough so it's really
hard to predict this one it could go
either way her her polling could drop or
climb well meanwhile uh
Israel is attacking Lebanon like crazy I
heard a number over 100 killed maybe up
to 200 by now um 400 wounded more by now
300 targets and more by now because it's
just this morning and uh fighting
continues but of course you know that uh
Israel blew up the pagers and the
walkie-talkies of the Hezbollah Fighters
which is making the Iran Islamic
revolutionary guard they've all been
ordered to stop using all their personal
communication devices including cell
phones radios and
pagers
so that would make Iran
unusually susceptible to
attack because their military at least
the part of the military they trust the
most wouldn't uh be able to communicate
effectively so
so anyway uh we'll keep an eye on that
uh apparently two more Hezbollah leaders
were killed in Lebanon by
Israel um I don't know how many leaders
they have in Hezbollah but there are a
lot less of them now and it makes me
wonder if what's happening is that since
it's impossible in the modern world not
to turn on your cell phone I feel like
they're just people that would be in the
General Circle of these leaders who
probably do not use cell phones but that
the people in their Circle may have just
turned it on for five minutes like I'd
love to know the details but I'll bet
they're still getting them through
electronic signal you know following it
could be that they've penetrated so well
that they have you know informants
everywhere so it might be partly that
but I feel like it's just lower level
people who turned on the phone five
minutes because they couldn't stand not
having it and then they just bombed the
house where that person was I
think Harris allegedly wants another
debate with Trump which is probably a
smart thing to say because it sounds
smart and it reinforces that people
thought she did well in the last one but
she knows it's not going to happen
because he's not going to do another
rigged debate and she's not going to go
on Fox News because she would feel that
would be rigged the other way so so it's
easy to say when you know it's not going
to happen and Trump would be crazy to do
it
actually well you heard that Usher who
uh his name is getting dragged into this
P didy situation when he was 13 years
old he stayed with py and uh learned to
party and we don't know what else he
learned but uh there are rumors of
horrible horrible things that happened
and then
Usher U his account all of his posts
were removed and everybody said oh no he
must be trying to you know hide his past
connections with Diddy or something like
that and then Usher stated today that he
got hacked and uh you shouldn't have
believed believed all the news it was
all fake and that somebody hacked him to
delete all of his
posts so does that sound like something
that really
happened uh I'm going to say
no I'm going to say no I don't think he
got hacked I mean it's
possible I would just say that if you're
going to play the odds that when a
celebrity says they were hacked on
social
media I don't know how often that's real
by the way I'm setting myself up now
because if somebody hacks me and does
something I'm telling you right now it
wasn't me
so so if I get hacked I'm going to
change my story
entirely anyway keep an eye on that uh
you know that story about uh journalist
Olivia nuzzy who
allegedly it started out as saying she
had an affair with RFK after
interviewing him um and then it turned
out well no not an affair not like a
physical Affair but more like they were
they were sexting each other and then it
turned into well okay it wasn't so much
that they were sexting each other is
that she was
sending uh increasingly pornographic say
RFK Junior's lawyer increasingly
pornographic messages he tried to block
her a few times she found other people's
accounts that she could reach him she
convinced him to unblock her because she
had important information but that was a
lie just to unblock him so she could
flirt with him some more now I think
there's some passing reference to the
fact that when he was sent pornographic
images he found it hard to stop it right
[Laughter]
away to which I say well I'd really have
to see the
messages for me to have an informed
opinion if I looked at the messages and
I said to myself oh he was all in well
that would look one way and if I saw the
messages and I said oh it looks like
he's trying to just be
polite but she's taking it as more than
that and now she's upping the game and
and he's again just trying to be polite
you know not insult or anything not
making a scene just you know be a
friendly polite answer maybe she took it
as
more so I'm going to say I'm not going
to believe anything about the
characterization of the
messages because that's not a category
that would be credible in this
conversation don't believe anything that
somebody tells you about what somebody
else message to somebody else you should
not believe any of that if you see it
even then it might be on a context so be
careful but if somebody's telling you
and characterizing what somebody else
said don't believe any of it that has no
evidentiary value whatsoever now to that
point uh the news says that RFK junr
might be looking into a possible lawsuit
against her which would be useful I
would think if he really wants to make
the case that this was her coming after
him and not anything Mutual so I don't
know if it's a good idea I can't imagine
he'd win the lawsuit but it might be a
good strategy to frame it as a victim
and victimizer instead of two people on
the same page
um anyway
you can you imagine how many people hit
on that
guy like probably everywhere he goes he
gets hit on by women just
continuously even at his current age
anyway Wall Street Journal says that uh
did you know that China is way ahead of
us in ship building which is bad because
those ships are military ships so now
China actually has more military ships
I've heard other people say you can't
you can't know anything by counting the
number of Warships
um because apparently our uh our Navy
capabilities are far beyond what they
have in their ships they just have a lot
of them I don't know I'm not sure if
that's true it's just something I saw in
the news but U apparently the US is
trying to compensate by getting South
Korea given that they're good allies of
us and they have a really strong ship
building industry uh as does Japan that
we're trying to get them to help us uh
build our
military
stuff that sounds like a good short-term
idea um it does seem to me that the
robots need to build those warships or
we we need to build drones I think I saw
a headline that Putin is trying to
increase his drone production by 10
times it's just going to be
drones yeah I to me I I'm always curious
how a a Naval Battleship can survive any
battle it seems to me that the ability
to destroy a ship that's sitting out
there like in this big ocean even even
though they have you know I know they
have defensive battle groups around a
battleship for example but around a
aircraft carrier that have lots of
support ships to shoot things down
before it got there but even with that
it's hard for me to imagine that a
superpower couldn't take out 100% of the
ships of any other side so I feel as
though every surface ship would be
destroyed within an hour of a real war
with China or Russia which is yet
another reason we're not going to do it
we're not going to get in a real war
with them it would be
dumb anyway so South Korea to the rescue
maybe according to just the news there's
an effort to train judges on climate
change so if you're a judge you know
about the law but you don't know as much
about science and then a lot of lawsuits
come in about CO2 usage and climate
change and then you got to be educated
so they're educating them in advance so
they know enough about climate change to
be good judges does that sound like a
good idea to
you do you think these judges are going
to get uh the the whole picture do you
think that when somebody teaches them
about climate
models they're going to tell them well
you know most of the scientists think
these are good but there's an argument
against them and it goes like this or
are they just going to say all the
climate models say we're in trouble so
we're in
trouble I feel like this is so
illegitimate and unethical that it
should be illegal to educate judges when
really what you're doing is brainwashing
them is it legal to brainwash a
judge if especially if they don't know
they're being brainwashed they think
they're being
educated it should be Am I Wrong it
should be you know even if there's not a
specific case that's Brewing even in
general it should be illegal to
brainwash a judge so that you can win
future
cases seems to me but I don't know I'm
no
lawyer well you know as you know that
save Act did not pass in Congress the
save Act was the one that would say you
can't vote in any state unless you've
proven you're a citizen now why did
Democrats and it was only Democrats vote
enough to not do that what would be the
reason you wouldn't want to need to know
if the voters are citizens I can't think
of
one not a legitimate one the only reason
I can think of is it makes it easier to
cheat
when when they give legitimate answers
to stuff like well you know we don't
want to disenfranchise people
who don't have ID but really want to
vote to which I say the same thing you
say all right let's compare the data to
the anecdotal
experience again anecdote doesn't mean
it's that that part's right but if
they're
different that should raise the flag so
let's see the experts on the the
Democrat side say that uh there's some
big problem with people who don't have
ID but definitely want to
vote and yet we've never found
one nor have we ever found anybody who
knew
one think about that it would be hard to
find one but you could find somebody who
knows one so take anything else in the
world that you've ever heard about have
you ever um have you ever tried to do
autoerotic affixation yourself no have
you ever heard of anybody who did yes
you have yeah you have actual names of
real people uh how about uh do you know
anybody personally who ever died in a
parachuting
accident probably not but I do I know
somebody personally who died in a
parachuting accident and you know
me so you know you you could reasonably
guess if you've watched me enough that I
wouldn't make that up that'd be a dumb
thing to just make up so there's
evidence that people die in Parachute
accidents
parachuting and in fact almost anything
that you could think of that's ever been
mentioned or you've been told exists you
could either find it in your own life or
you you know of somebody who knows about
it right
but I don't know anybody who knows
anybody who knows anybody who never
found anybody who wanted to vote and
couldn't figure out how to get an ID not
anybody not anybody who knows anybody
who knows anybody not a Kevin Bacon
situation Six Degrees of Separation not
anything and again I tell you that I
only have to go one degree of separation
to identify everything I've ever heard
of about murder with a gun well I don't
think I know anybody personally murdered
with a gun but I definitely know people
who know people were murdered with a gun
right every Everything has that quality
you at least know somebody who knows
somebody but not anybody who wanted to
vote but couldn't get an ID not
one
so um
also uh Al Sharpton on MSNBC and some of
his other cohorts were saying it's
terrible that Georgia has decided their
election board decided just recently uh
that all of their voting would be on
hand-counted ballots instead of using
machines and uh the MSNBC people want
you to know that there's no way you know
one of their guest said there's no way
they'll be able to count 10 million
votes how could you possibly do that
to which I say yeah you can do that
everybody knows you can do
that every one of us knows they can do
that will it be done that
night it's not going to be done that
night no matter how they do it it
doesn't matter how they do it it's not
going to be done that night we know that
so why would you be um opposed to the
most secure way of voting
and everybody knows it everybody knows
it's the most secure way of voting well
it's the same reason you'd be opposed to
the save act the Democrats are
telegraphing their intention to cheat so
clearly I've never seen anybody so
clearly tell you they're going to cheat
but here's what it feels like hey Scott
um I'll be uh robbing the bank down on
the the corner there on Friday
and I'll say wait what what did you just
say I'll be robbing the bank down in
that corner there by the gas station I'm
going to rob that on
Friday and I'll
say I feel like maybe I should do
something about
that they could not be telling us more
clearly that they intend to cheat now I
tell you all the time that you can't
read people's minds but they have all
the time in the world to tell us what
their reasoning
is and their reasoning is so patently
stupid that you don't have to wonder if
those are real reasons of course they're
not real
reasons so yes they are telling us as
clearly as you possibly can that they
hope and plan to cheat like
crazy so there it
is ladies and gentlemen this concludes
my prepared remarks for today I'm going
to go talk to the people on locals
privately but I remind you that the
dilber 2025 desk calendar the page day
is back um but you can only get it at
the link dilbert.com it is not going to
be available on Amazon and not going to
be available in regular stores and that
was the way I could do it to have it
made in America longer story but if you
have it made in America it's
prohibitively expensive unless unless
you cut out all the
middleman so that's what I had to do so
and if shipping looks expensive which it
is um then buy more than one and your
shipping cost will look pretty
reasonable after that because you know
you want some for gifts all right
everybody I'm going to go say hi to the
locals people privately the rest of you
thanks for joining and we'll be private
with locals in 30
seconds
