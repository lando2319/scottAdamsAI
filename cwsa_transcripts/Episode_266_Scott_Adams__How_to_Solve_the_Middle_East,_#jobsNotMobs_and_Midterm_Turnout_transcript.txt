hey everybody
get in here today will be
the best coffee with scott adams
you've ever seen now i don't want to
over promise but i think i can deliver
today
and you know what that means it starts
with this simultaneous sip
today from a tiny little cup grab your
cup your
your your vessel your your mug your
stein
fill it with a beverage of your choice
lift it to your lips with me
and enjoy the simultaneous hip
oh that's good stuff so let's start with
the fun part
um some of you saw that president trump
tweeted the hashtag
jobsnotmobs last night after he tested
it down at the rally
apparently he got a good enough uh good
enough response at the rally
that it turned into a tweet and
some of you saw the uh the hashtag sort
of developing on
social media i should tell you that
i am not the originator of it
but i helped i was one of the people who
helped to popularize it
so we can see this amazing
uh situation where something is created
on the internet you know an idea and
i think it took six days
for it to be created on the internet by
somebody i don't even know
i just saw it somewhere and repeated it
um ellie alexander had a post
talking about mobs and whether that was
good by itself and he was suggesting
some
improvements to it i chimed in
um copying what i saw on the internet
which was that somebody had said
jobs now mobs and it turned into a
hashtag in about 10 minutes
and took six days
from a good idea to the president's
mouth
have you ever seen anything like that
before there's there is something truly
special about this time
where where a good idea can start
anywhere
and it can go anywhere
in six days and that probably was a long
time right
so just think about the world you live
in where if you've got an idea
just as this you know random unnamed
uh twitter user had and
you know i wish i could give them credit
but i was not
i was not smart enough to note who said
it first i just saw it on the internet
in somebody's comment and i thought oh
that's good that could go somewhere
uh but think about that
and now i'm gonna dovetail into the
coolest thing you've ever heard in your
life
i don't like to oversell it but here it
comes
it's to be the coolest thing you've ever
heard in your life
well top 10 maybe it goes like this
i'm going to bring together a bunch of
concepts that you've heard before
wait for the big reveal because it's a
good one
it goes like this have you ever heard
the saying that uh never let a good
crisis go wasted i'm not sure who said
it might have been
uh mayor of chicago
but the idea is that sometimes if
everything's going to hell
it creates an opportunity but yes rahm
emanuel
who weirdly i met one time in a hallway
sort of a small world situation i met
him once
uh years ago and
so that's your first thing never never
let a good crisis go to waste
and the saudi arabia thing is a crisis
right
nobody knows what the heck to do so
that's the first thing
now here's another concept that i've
told you a few times
that the edge of doom
looks amazingly similar to the edge of
victory
sometimes you can be on the it feels
like you're on the edge of losing
everything it's just the worst possible
moment
you know it's sort of darkest before the
dawn situation
and we're often confused by those two
situations because they look so similar
you know the edge of doom and the edge
of victory
so think about that and we'll get back
to that in a moment
so here's our situation with saudi
arabia
saudi arabia seems to
seems to be guilty of murdering a
journalist
in their embassy now i think we all
agree that if it had not been a
journalist
we would not be talking about it right
it's the fact that it's a journalist
that
makes it a story because it's no longer
about one critic
being murdered it's about free speech
it's about journalism it's about the the
press
and so that pretty much guarantees yeah
he's a columnist an opinion writer but
still he's part of the press
and this pretty much guarantees that it
will stay a story
and will stay a priority all right so
it's not going to just go away
but it is true that every story's
temperature comes down
from its highest peak and the
highest temperature you know talking
about the public opinion
on the saudi admissi thing started sky
high
but over time everything gets a little
bit less
attenuated so president trump is waiting
as his critics say to for saudi arabia
to come up with a credible
excuse that he can maybe accept
so that he doesn't have to uh punish
saudi arabia in some fashion but let's
talk about that
is there any way to punish saudi arabia
could we punish them militarily
no there is no chance that we're going
to militarily do anything with saudi
arabia
they're they're an ally could we
penalize them within their political
system well
i don't think so because they don't
really have a political system that's
that's really you know penetrable from
the outside
could we punish them economically
well in theory yes but the only way we
could do it is by hurting ourselves
just as much hurting our interests
having less
influence over them because they're not
buying our jets and therefore they can
you know if they get their jets from
china china has influence over them
because they need parts and service and
stuff from the
from the host the country that sells
them the stuff
so if we can't do it militarily we can't
do it politically
we can't do it economically what do you
do
because you also can't do nothing so
here's your setup
you can't do something because you can't
think of what to do
and you can't do nothing who are you
gonna call
who do you call when you can't do
something
and you can't do nothing because the way
people will regard it
the way people will think about it
that's right you would call a master
persuader
because somehow you have to solve the
unsolvable
psychological part the psychological
part is that they have to be punished
assuming that the charges hold up and it
looks like they will
and they have to not be punished the
only way you can do that
is to find a solution that parties can
look at
the same thing the same events and some
people could say
man they got punished good and other
people such as saudi arabia can say
completely legitimately we did not get
punished
how can you come up with a solution that
is punishing them
and also totally not punishing them
can it be done i'm going to tell you how
goes like this you want saudi arabia
to do something that they don't want to
do
but that could be construed as something
so positive
that it's a penalty without being a
penalty
here's the idea you say to saudi arabia
we need you to recognize israel and we
need you to fund
the recovery of the palestinians so
that's your bill now the palestinians
you own
financially you we may throw in
saudi arabia that we're going to let
saudi arabia
guard the temple mount now i don't know
a lot about the middle east but
it i understand that there's a big
discussion about
who who gets to guard the temple mount
and is it the temple mount i think
that's the right thing
now remember don't let a crisis go to
waste
the saudi arabia situation is a crisis
it's created
is created in muhammad bin salman
a need to do something and the something
he needs to do
has to be bigger than murdering and
dismembering
a journalist an opinion writer whatever
you want to call him
it has to be bigger than dismantling
dismantling and murdering and torturing
uh somebody who's a member of the press
what is bigger than that not many things
right oh is it the al-aqsa
mosque i'm sorry uh so i don't
as you can tell i'm not in any any
expert on the middle east
but suppose you came up with this
situation
saudi arabia we need you to do something
big
and we need you to become you know
come back to the the member of
productive nations
and this is the time to lean on them to
get something done
that's much bigger than this and
middle east peace is achievable
maybe because of this
maybe because of this you don't want a
crisis to go to waste
so we've never had more leverage on
saudi arabia
at exactly uh oh al-aqsa is on the
temple mount okay
so thank you for that clarification uh
we've never had more influence on saudi
arabia
at the same time that we have good
relationships
with them or we did until this at the
same time
the saudi arabia has been friendlier
to israel than anybody else at the same
time the saudi arabia and israel
would like to form a block against
iranian influence
at the same time that saudi arabia has
to do something
that to some people would look like a
huge penalty
and to others would look like a victory
think about it now i know that some of
you are sitting home
a little bit stunned right now because
for the first time probably for the
first time in your
life you may you might have even got a
little tingle on your arm
because you might have realized that for
the first time in your life
this could actually happen and there
might be
never a better time so that would be
um my suggestion and by the way
this is not my suggestion
i've asked the person whose idea this
was whether i can
you know reveal the identity and i
haven't got an answer
i wanted to do this periscope before i
got an answer
but let me check and see if i have an
answer because i'll give i'll give
credit where credit is due
once i get an answer so
uh so again it's not my idea
but it came up in a conversation that i
had recently
and i'll just reiterate it for those
just joining
we've got this bad situation with saudi
arabia you never want to waste a good
crisis
so it might be a chance to do something
big that you couldn't do under ordinary
circumstances
we need to come up with a situation that
is a penalty for saudi arabia
if it turns out that they you know are
conclusively behind the murder
and people expect that to be the case at
the same time it's a penalty for saudi
arabia
it has to be not a penalty for saudi
arabia so they have to win
and lose simultaneously and
recognizing israel would would do it it
would take all the energy
out of the question about the
jachogie it would move it to something
bigger and it'd have to be much bigger
to take the energy away from that story
because that's pretty big
um and they could throw in maybe funding
the palestinians
recovery whatever that looks like i'm
sure it's expensive
and you could throw in uh letting
letting them
be the official country to guard the
al-aqsa
mosque if i'm getting the words right
um yeah so somebody's clarifying
it's not the temple mount not the temple
mount but just the al-aqsa
part of it because that would be the
muslim part
now if saudi arabia were to agree with
that would it not look like
they had done something they didn't want
to do it was hard it was risky
it was a penalty but it's also good for
them
they you know they could get the they
could get the credit for the win
at the same time it's a penalty there
are very few times
that you will see a situation that lines
up
just this way all right i have my answer
[Laughter]
so the answer so i'm i'm looking at a
message from
uh the individual whose idea this was
and i asked if you mind if i mentioned
him or her and uh
the answer is ambiguous that if it would
help
but not necessarily all right so here's
what i'm going to do
i'm not going to give you the identity
unless this gets some traction
all right i may rethink this but rather
than distract you
so i won't distract you by putting
another name on it let's just keep the
idea clean if it gets some traction
uh to get some traction there's a
there's a record of the conversation
so that credit credit will go where
credit is due
all right um
all right do you see uh
do you see this as a possibility
sounds okay not going to work well you
know
if you're president trump and you see an
opening like this
you're at least going to bring up the
topic aren't you
because it's at least good enough to put
it on the table
and i think we have a strange group of
players right now you've got in my
opinion you've got the
you know the strongest players in saudi
arabia the united states and israel
that you've ever had if you look at the
leadership of those three countries
it's the strongest you know strongest
three
we've ever had they're all deal makers
they're all smart
they're all they're all innovative
they're all you know
willing to try new stuff they're all
willing to take a risk if it's the
right kind of risk so we've never had
the right people like this before
it's just sort of perfect all right um
all right just looking at your comments
um what else is going on today there are
some other stories let's talk about the
caravan i think everybody's got the same
take on the caravan
the immigration as an issue
used to be a concept so if you're
talking about
too much illegal immigration you would
use statistics and you'd say well
the crime rate is this and there are x
number of people
and you know they're bringing crime but
if it's just a concept
if it's just a concept um
it's not very persuasive concepts are
not persuasive
images are persuasive if you say a
picture of something is persuasive
and so the human caravan has put a
picture
on immigration just when the republicans
would benefit the most
so i don't know who organized
the caravan but it was it was almost
like it was made for republicans
i can't imagine anything that would be
more positive
for turning out the vote and for turning
some people on the left against them
because the the
caravan looks scary
now before you jump on me and say racist
racist racist
it's scary because they're just a lot of
people it's not because they're brown
it's not because they're coming from
south of the border i know somebody's
going to say that it's not that
but if you put a whole bunch of males
and the pictures i saw were more male
than anything else
i only saw a few pictures but they
seemed like they were 90 male
if you see a bunch of able-bodied
male folks in a big crowd
coming your way you don't feel good
you think oh this looks dangerous
so independent of what it actually is
the way it's going to feel and look and
and just play
in terms of our psychology um
is is very pro-republican at this point
um you may have seen i tweeted
an article in breitbart
by joel pollock in which i uh
i predicted that it would be the highest
turnout
we've seen in who knows how long for the
the midterms uh i think i think
republicans
might be setting a trap
and it might be the same trap that they
set for the presidential election which
is
to understate their future actions
if there was anything that could
describe the republican brand
it would be something like the more
action than words
so i think you're going to see more
action than words in a way you've never
seen before
the republicans are going to like
winning and they're going to like how
they feel
if they can get another surprise win
now i'm still not predicting a win only
because i don't know
enough about the details of the specific
races and stuff
i'm not i'm not predicting a loss i'm
just assuming that the experts
know more about it than i do at this
point but that the turnout
will be extraordinary now it may also be
true that the democrats have an
extraordinary turnout and
so that's the part that's unknowable but
i think
i think republicans are gonna surprise
all right uh
okay i think that's enough for now i'm
going to sign off
we may see president trump be the first
double nobel winner
because there's totally a possibility
that sometime in 2019 the president will
wrap up
north korea and have and have a workable
middle east peace plan
it's totally possible now you could have
never said that before
but it is totally possible now all right
i'll keep you on that positive note
and wait before we go let's drink to
that
let's drink to hashtag
jobs not mobs let's tr let's drink to
peace in the korean peninsula
let's drink to maybe peace in the middle
east someday
let's drink too
let's let's drink to more winning
and i'll i'll talk to you later
oh two simultaneous sips that's the best
