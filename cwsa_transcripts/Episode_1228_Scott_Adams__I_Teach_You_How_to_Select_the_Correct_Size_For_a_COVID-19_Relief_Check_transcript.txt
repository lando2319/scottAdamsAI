i didn't see you there come on in
come on in it's time you found it
yeah it's time for coffee with scott
adams the best
time of the day the best
number one and what makes it so good
well it's a participation thing
it's where you become one with people
around the world
simultaneously with the simultaneous sip
good morning omar
good to see you uh and if you'd like to
participate in the simultaneous sit the
best thing in the world today
all you need is a copper margarita glass
a tanker chelsea steiner canteen jagar
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better except for your
coronavirus checks
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen right now
go
yeah that was pretty good pretty good
well here's your lesson for the day
have you ever had this experience where
you had some problems in your life but
then you
drank some alcohol or you smoked some
something or you did some hallucinogens
and suddenly
your problems were exactly the same
but you don't feel bad about it your
subjective
you know your subjective experience
could be fine
even though your problems are all the
same now if you have problems
and you're feeling good about yourself
that's a bad situation
because if you're feeling good but there
are problems you need to solve
maybe you're not going to solve them
because well you feel good why should
you do anything
so you do want to make sure that you
feel bad enough about your problems
to solve them but during a 24 hour day
most of that 24 hour days you're not
going to
have anything that you could do to solve
your problems sometimes you have to
sleep and bathe and
get other stuff done so how do you feel
good
during that time that there's just
nothing you can do about your problems
you're doing other things then well if
you could find a way to hack your brain
so that when you can work on your
problems you feel bad about them because
that would be motivating
but the moment there's nothing you can
do you could flip a switch
and just feel good about your life even
with the same amount of problems and
then when it's time to work about them
you go back now what if you could do
that wouldn't that be
incredible right think think how
different your life would be
if the only time you worried about your
problems
were the times that you could actually
do something you know you could work
harder or you could try something and do
something
and i would call that uh trying to make
that happen
i call collectively brain hacking
meaning tricks that you use on your own
brain
to modify it to permanently
restructure it so it's more effective
now can you rewire your own
brain yeah yeah you do it all the time
if you go to school for example
and you educate yourself you're creating
a physical change in your brain because
you can't store memories
and and learn things without new you
know new structures literally
physically growing in your brain so you
physically reprogram your brain
with every experience all i'm suggesting
is that brain
hacking is being a little bit more
directive about it
where you're saying okay what
specifically do i do now
and here's your micro lesson on this
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna solve this
whole brain hacking thing because it's a
big field
i'll just give you one little thing to
think about
and this one little thing is gonna grow
it's a little idea a little reframing
that even when you hear it you're going
to say uh
i kind of already knew that but it's not
that you didn't know it
it's that you may not have used it as
your frame or your filter on life which
is a little different than simply
knowing something is true
here's what i'm going to add to it have
you had this experience i'm hoping most
of you have had the following
experience first of all if you've ever
done
any of the hallucinogens or whatever
you've probably experienced having
all the same problems but yet you feel
happy about it
likewise without doing any kind of
illegal substance
wouldn't you like to be able to
reproduce that and one of the things
you'll notice
is and i hope most of you had this
experience have you ever had
incredible sex not just
ordinary sex but like
incredible sex the kind that were where
even though you might have had a lot of
sex in your life
there will be like a few occasions that
you'll remember forever
have you ever had that happen just i
hope so i hope you've all had
that one occasion where it's like oh my
goodness i didn't even know
this was possible here's what i want you
to remember
when you're in that mode and and
after you're done with it and you're
still sort of in the that the chemicals
are flooding your
your brain and you're feeling good about
it here's the tiny tiny little tip
that will grow consider that
while you're feeling amazing all of your
problems
are exactly the same but you're feeling
amazing now does that sound like a big
deal
because you already knew that right was
there anybody here who didn't know
it feels good to have gray sex so some
of you should be saying
i don't think you told us anything i
feel like we all knew that that feels
good
the only thing i'm adding is the
reframing part
remind yourself and it's the reminding
yourself that's the important part
because that's what turns it into a
filter over time
repetition remind yourself every time
you can find yourself in one of those
situations
doesn't matter if it's because you had
great sex or just something good
happened
remind yourself that you feel good while
all of your problems
are exactly the same now you might think
that's not a big deal
and the first time you think of it it
won't be
the second time you think about it it
also won't be
it's a little teeny thing like a seed
that will grow forever
so think of this little acorn as you're
planting it in the yard
and you've got a long life ahead of you
and in 40 years you're really going to
like that
oak tree that you planted but it might
take 40 years
i'm saying that over the course of your
life you can keep working on that little
thought
every time you have a moment of peace in
this terrible world
tell yourself huh none of my problems
have fixed
and yet i feel good and you'll find over
time
that you can reproduce that and you can
find
that good feeling even in the context of
everything going bad
because you remember it and you focused
on it
and you filtered on it and suddenly
you'll find that you're well maybe not
suddenly but over time
you'll find that you can experience a
happy day
even if things are not exactly where you
want them
well this is a very long way to tell you
that i'm in a better mood today
but moving on to next
next topic there's a thing that's going
to happen this year in politics
that needs a name so i'm going to
suggest a name
for it you know it's good to have a name
for a trump derangement syndrome
because if you have a name for it
everybody can refer to it without
explaining the whole thing again so
here's a concept i'm going to give a
name to it
i'm going to call it the trump contrast
problem
or the tcp if you want to if you like
your acronyms
the trump contrast problem and the
problem specifically
is for biden and it goes like this
when trump was uh well he's still in
office but
during trump's administration no matter
what he did
he would be viciously criticized right
so if you're a democrat you you went
through four years of everything trump
did was bad
because the media you consumed told me
that it didn't matter what he did
you know with a few rare exceptions
right they did say
warp speed was a good idea but with rare
exceptions pretty much
whatever trump does is the bad thing
but what happens when trump is no longer
the focus of the story
and let's say he's moved on to another
career and it's just biden
and biden's just doing his job there's a
problem that biden is going to run into
that that you can start seeing it form
now but it's going to get bigger
and it's the fact that his contrast with
trump
once trump is no longer the topic which
they have to say bad things about him
every moment of every day
once he just becomes an historical
figure
i mean moderate historical because it's
recent
people are going to look at what he did
quite differently here's your first
example here's what biden said
about the covent situation he said quote
joe biden said our darkest days in the
battle against covet are ahead of us
not behind us he said so we need to
prepare ourselves
to steal our spine now how did you feel
when joe biden told you that the darkest
days are ahead of us
do you see it that's the trump contrast
problem
if trump had never existed and
any president biden or somebody else
came out and said our darkest days are
ahead of us
you know i'm just getting you ready so
you need to be ready for this
you wouldn't have really noticed it was
wrong would you
because there would not be nothing to
compare it to you'd say well i'm glad
he's warning us he's being
perfectly honest you don't want your
president to lie to you right
it looks honest it looks useful
if there were nothing to compare it to
you'd say yeah it's pretty that's good
president
he's telling us to shape up and and look
out for all this danger
but because trump is the
the the optimist of all optimists
when you see biden's communication style
and it's such a bummer
it's like it's all down and negative and
things are going to happen
you say to yourself i get why biden is
trying to be honest
so that we're not you know all
pollyannas but
i kind of did like the trump optimism
right don't you already miss it
when when you hear something like that
you miss it trump was saying we're going
to do
project warp speed we're going to beat
this thing
you know even though there'll be deaths
of course we'll still get the economy
open
so trump is non-stop optimism even to a
flaw
because you could argue that his
optimism cost him his job
right because the coronavirus was sort
of a mismatch for his optimism
you needed to be a little bit more
medical for the the public to be
comfortable about it
so the the fake news turned his optimism
into a negative they could have easily
turned it into a positive imagine if the
fake news had said yeah the president's
saying
is no big deal but he's an optimist so
keep that in mind
but here's what the scientists say make
up your own mind
right imagine if the fake news simply
framed it correctly
your president is always an optimist but
be warned
your scientists are saying something
that's a little slightly different
a little less positive you've got two
different messages one comes from
somebody you know is an optimist
keep that in mind scientists are saying
something different
might be a little less optimistic how
would that be bad
would you feel underserved by your news
if they just said yeah you know the
president's going to be on the optimist
side
now which of those methods works better
optimism or not what kind of depends
right
if what you're trying to do is operation
warp speed
would biden have done that if the
scientist told them it couldn't be done
because that's what happened all the
experts said
you know you could go faster but it's
going to take four or five years
that's what the expert said and biden
says i will listen to the experts
he biden guaranteed you he guaranteed it
by making his primary i'd say his
primary
really his primary campaign theme which
i think he will keep by the way
is that he will be consistent with the
experts
if biden had been president and kept his
promise
there would be no vaccine for maybe four
years
think about that you don't have to
wonder
you don't have to wonder if biden would
have done a good job
he wouldn't have because he's very
aggressively telling you he wouldn't
have done
the most important thing which will get
us out of this he wouldn't have done it
right i mean it would have happened
eventually but he wouldn't have done it
so yeah you've got a big trump
contrast problem every time biden does
something now
people are going to say i remember us
criticizing trump for that
but once you see the other way it works
trump doesn't look so bad does he you're
going to be
amazed at how how trump's
approval goes up in time because once
the fake news noise
dies down and you can just look at what
he did
just you know get all the noise out just
say well what do you do
it's going to be impressive super
impressive
it i believe trump if if he does nothing
else
and it looks like that will be close to
true maybe
he will be one of the greatest
presidents of all time just based on
record
and i'm sure of that i'm a positive of
that
in fact that's one thing that i want any
doubt i don't have any doubt that his
historical
reputation will be far higher than his
current one
i'm still waiting for that big trump
military coup
that everybody was warning me about you
know because he's a big old crazy guy
and
he doesn't obey the constitution and
even if he lost the election he's just
gonna
get the military to surround the around
the
white house and stay in job stay in the
job
so are you seeing anything like that
forming
this is another one of those situations
where if you were
probably you were a democrat if you
thought this if you thought that trump
was
actually going to try to stay in office
while the entire process as corrupt as
it might be
well the process says he lost and biden
was the president
if you really thought he was going to
actually do that
you have to look at your ability to
predict
because it's really bad there was never
really any risk of president trump
trying to stay in office
by force none do you know why
do you want to give me an e do you want
to hear an easy reason why
because his family and his business are
not protected
just imagine if you would that it's and
it's
it's stupid to imagine it because it's
so ridiculous it will never happen
imagine if you would that trump said
yeah i think i lost the vote or even if
i thought i won the vote
i'm gonna get the military to keep me in
office anyway
what happens the day he does that
every trump property burns to the ground
am i right think about it
the day that a hypothetical
trump you know tried to keep his
position
while actually losing on paper the the
election
the day that he's he said the military
is the only thing keeping me in power
every trump property would burn to the
ground
every trump family member
who was not uh protected by the military
at that moment
would be rounded up by the public the
public would find all the family members
and say we're going to hold on to your
family members until something changes
right there isn't any practical way
that a president trump could hold power
with the military
because there's just too much exposed
everything it just can't be done
there's no way he would win right and
there would always be enough people in
the military
to take him out right you know it
imagine if you will that somehow
a president whether it was trump or
anybody else imagine if somehow he got a
general to agree
sorry all right i got a general to agree
and the general orders his troops
to do whatever circle you know protect
the
capital or whatever you'd still have to
get all the people
the the actual military they'd all have
to kind of be on board
and i don't think that's gonna happen
right even if you get the general to say
to do it
imagine you're in the military you've
taken all the oaths of protecting the
country etc
etc you've taken an oath
an oath to protect the country and then
your general says uh
instead of following the constitution
we're just going to run a coup
so you know instead of doing your normal
stuff of protecting the country
now we're going to attack the country
and you're in the military
and your own management your own
leadership tells you to attack
your own country all right now they
could try to sell it as protecting the
country whatever
but it's going to look like attacking
the country to some number
of the people in the military if you put
me in the military
just average person i'm in the military
and you say scott
orders have come down you have to
surround the capitol and keep this
president who
on paper lost the election but he wants
to stay what do i do
well i don't go and they say well we'll
put you in jail
they'll say as opposed to being
a traitor okay
i'll take jail if those are my two
choices
my two choices are overthrow the united
states
or go to jail um i'm gonna go to jail
i'm gonna pick that one every time and
let me and
i don't know how to say this without
getting canceled so i'm going to say
this in an indirect way
so i don't get cancelled okay
if you took a thousand military people
with weapons and you put them in the
general vicinity of the president
you can't guarantee that all of those
weapons will be pointed at the public
that's all i'm saying i'm just saying
that it would be the world's
shortest coup because out of a thousand
patriots let's say
military members who are you know
hypothetically protecting the president
you telling me out of a thousand
ordinary
american citizens who are trained in the
military
patriotic you tell me there's not one of
them that would take out the president
for the benefit of the country
not one of them that's a lot of guns in
one place
they'd all have to be on the same side
now how does
how does somebody like iran or putin get
any kind of a military to protect them
well it's hard you don't take rank and
fire
file military and say okay now you're
protecting me
because even putin and even the
ayatollah wouldn't
trust rank and file military they have
to create their own like secret
police and you want to make sure that
everybody's in your secret military
you know where their family is so if
they turn bad you kill their family
right that's how the dictators do it so
in order to have a military force that
would keep a dictator in power
you can't use your regular military
you're going to have to use some kind of
a
yeah something like the ss or the
revolutionary guard
you need some kind of a special military
so none of that exists
so anybody who had a fantasy about trump
staying in power
you just don't know how anything works
nothing could have worked that
uh actor kevin sorbo had a funny tweet
he said this election reminds me
of the time all the security cameras
outside of epstein's
cell shut off and i thought that's one
of those perfect
uh if we live in a simulation there's
code
reuse because it does feel like that
doesn't it
you know as analogies go doesn't it feel
like this is just the same code
they just took the cameras off of
epstein and they also took the cameras
off the election
it's basically the same story they just
changed the characters
all right so trump tweeted this morning
the video of
the georgia ballot counting people from
the video camera
and it shows a a woman named ruby
she's so famous that we know her by her
first name everybody knows who ruby is
if you're following politics
so ruby who apparently has lawyered up
so we don't get to talk to her
but she is seen there scanning the same
same group of ballots
three times now you've got it on video
it's very clearly and i would say this
is almost certainly true the video seems
to be pretty clear
it's the same ballots she puts them in
they go through the machine she walks
over she picks them up she puts them
through again
and she scans them three times
doesn't that look a little suspicious
all right so if you see the same ballots
uh scanned three times do you have proof
proof i say or at least really strong
evidence
that fraud happened what kind of
credibility
should you put on a video that shows you
the exact crime
okay let's see if i've taught you
anything have you learned anything in
2020
what percent credibility would you put
on a video
that shows the crime it's it's right in
front of you
from zero to one to a hundred percent
tell me how reliable
the video should be uh i'm seeing
fifty percent a hundred percent zero
zero percent zero you say okay
i'm seeing more zeros ten ten percent
ten percent
ten percent twenty-five percent fifteen
percent
the correct answer is zero zero
yeah and i'm actually quite proud of all
of you because most of you got the right
answer
if you're going to put credibility on it
the credibility of any video
no matter how clear you think you're
seeing the events
no matter how clearly you see them in
2020
the value of direct video evidence of a
crime
is zero now it's still useful
because this should tell you what to
look into if you see this on video you
don't walk away
you find out what happened you look into
it a little bit more right
but on the surface if if the only thing
you know is the video
zero credibility and i would say the
same with the george floyd video the
same with the
uh the covington kids video you probably
could come up
the same with the drinking bleach video
because that says fake edit
same with the fine fine people hoax
because that was a trick edit
video is nothing
when it comes to evidence and proof it
used to be kind of the thing right used
to be sort of the gold standard
if you could see it with your own eyes
well yeah there it is
but that doesn't just doesn't apply and
we've learned that
so suppose we looked into it what could
we learn i have
questions number one what did
i see let me tell you i watched the same
video you did
and what i saw was no crime at all
i didn't see any crime so the president
tweeted this
and lots of people are reacting to it as
though they're watching the crime
but i watched the same video i didn't
see a crime
do you want do you want to watch me
recreate the video
and show you why i didn't see a crime
don't you believe
since none of us are experts in the
ballot counting process
so i don't know enough about the process
but i'll make some
uh obvious assumptions obvious
assumptions right things i think
have to be true they have to have some
mechanism
where you feed through a batch of
ballots and there's an error
that you can clear the air and re-run
them without
double counting do do we all agree that
it has to be true
there's some kind of process for
resetting it
but you'd have to push a button right to
reset it
and then recount here's what we see on
the video
she stands up her body
covers her keyboard in her computer and
we don't know what's happening
if she were going to push a button to
reset the ballots to count them
can you see it here i'll do it right now
here's a test
i'm i'm typing and i'm resetting i'm
resetting the ballots to zero can you
see it
no you can't see it because i'm standing
right in front of it i'm standing right
in front of
the only thing that matters which is did
i do this
if i did this and hit the button
there's no crime because it's not a
crime to rescan things that
that had an error right now am i
correctly
describing the process there's a button
i don't know but you don't know either
so you don't know if there's a crime
here's some other questions i would ask
why it assuming that the video
was was capturing all of these workers
for the entire night
did you ask yourself why if this was a
big
a big ballot cheating scam
have you asked yourself why only one of
the workers
on one occasion ran a stack through
three times
because it wasn't a big enough stack to
change the election
but you watched them all night and only
one worker
ran one little stack two extra times
that's it if you were cheating wouldn't
you have lots of these
wouldn't the other workers also be
double scanning
wouldn't ruby have done this a bunch of
times
why would she do it twice when it
wouldn't be enough to change the result
what would be the point of that well i
suppose you could say it's a clever
packetized crime where everybody was
told
no you don't want to do too much on your
machine you ruby
your job is is two rescans just do that
and then other people will do other
kinds of shenanigans and we'll add it
all together and it'll be enough but if
anybody gets caught
we'll say well those scans that ruby did
they weren't enough
they didn't change anything so sure you
caught us
but you caught this little thing so now
maybe
but that feels a little too complicated
doesn't it
so that's some questions here's another
question i have
does the machine not recognize
duplicates
so this is like a big lack of knowledge
on my part so fill this in for me
uh my understanding is that maybe the
envelopes
that the ballots the mail-in ballots
come in have some identifiers on it
maybe uh
maybe there's a scan code or something
but
does the actual ballot once it's removed
from the envelope
is each ballot individualized with any
kind of an identifier
such that if you scanned it twice the
system would say oh we've already seen
that one
is that a thing suppose
suppose the system and i don't i don't
think this is true
so what i'm saying is just speculative
but i'm just saying suppose the counting
machines were such
that if an error occurred
it would just uh it would just tell you
to rescan them
and then you take your pile and you
rescan them and let's say you picked up
too many ballots to rescan let's say you
accidentally picked up the wrong pile
and tried to rescan it would the system
see oh these have already been through
and just
ignore them or would it say whatever is
the
most recent vote is the one that'll
count and i'll delete the earlier ones
in which case you don't have to push a
reset all you have to do is run the
batch that didn't go
through a second time it deletes all the
first votes by the same people
keeps the more recent vote you don't
even have to hit the reset button
because the system just knows each one
is individual and it just keeps it just
counts the most recent one
i don't know i doubt that i would doubt
the machine is
designed that way but i don't know how
it's doubted it's designed
so you can't tell if there's a crime
there that's the point
and i also saw somebody in the comments
say that georgia did
a a hand recount of the ballots
would not a hand recount tell you if
this problem was a problem
wouldn't the batch they get ran through
three times
produce uh more votes than ballots
so if they did a hand recount of the
ballot and do a fact check on me that
did they do a hand recount to the ballot
if they did
then there couldn't have been a crime
right or is there some way there still
could have been a crime even with a hand
recount of the ballots
i don't know so here's my point
if you don't know how the system works
you definitely
don't know you saw a crime so i would
like to be
ruby's defense because even
guilty people deserve a good defense and
there's no evidence in my opinion
in my opinion i have personally seen and
i've watched all the videos
i have personally seen no direct
evidence that ruby
created any kind of a crime or even
anything
inappropriate now i'm not ruling it out
i'm just saying i haven't seen any
evidence of it so
if you have you might be imagining it
here's another question i have
suppose the system can't doesn't have
identification on each ballot i don't
know if it does or not
but couldn't you build a system that
checks the hand markings because they
were done by hand
does the system keep a digital
reproduction of the
the ballot does anybody know that does
the ballot simply get
tabulated and then the only thing that's
stored is the result
or does each ballot actually get copied
in addition to tabulated
so there's actually a physical picture
of the actual ballot each one
does anybody know if that's a thing
somebody says yes the ballot image is
permanent all right
here's the thing are you ready for this
i don't know if anybody has suggested
this yet
but probably because it's a little bit
obvious if
if the ballots were done by hand and i
think that's the case
then there would be slight differences
in how you would
you would fill out a box compared to how
i would fill out a box
similar to how handwriting would be
similar from one person to another
could you not take all these scanned and
saved images of ballots
and simply compare them and see if you
can find out if one person
filled out a lot of ballots because they
would be too much of a match
in the exact way they were filled out is
that a thing
so i'm just asking the question if you
have these could you not tell that they
were filled out by the same people
just by just by a good image comparison
now it would be like handwriting so even
if the same person did lots of ballots
it wouldn't look exactly the same but
maybe they could find some
correlation i think they could
all right the perfect way to close 2020
would be with something that's just
batshit crazy
and and only could have happened in 2020
and it looks like looks like that's
gonna happen
right because trump has now
starting to crap on the congress's big
omnibus
bill that they call a covid relief bill
that has almost nothing to do with covet
and after all that talking what they
came up with
was a 600 check for each person now
there's a bunch of other things in the
bill
but the direct check to people suffering
was
600 now the president came out aft
after they'd done their work the
president said you did it badly
basically he said congress you totally
messed up
complete you blew it the number should
be more like two thousand dollars not
six hundred but here's the fun part
aoc agreed and
so now president trump and aoc are on
the same page
about this specific relief bill
and is it a coincidence that president
trump
and aoc normally would be on opposite
sides of everything
is it a coincidence that they agreed on
this one thing
nope now they're not the only ones who
agree i guess pelosi also said yes but
she was trying to cover her ass
and i think uh at least one other part
of member of the squad agreed with aoc
but let's use aoc as our sort of the
star of the story
and i've told you since the beginning of
aoc's rise in politics i think elon omar
said said agreed tolab said yes
i told you the aoc had a political
instinct
for theater that that is similar to
president trump so these are the things
that aoc and trump have in common
they both have an understanding of the
theater
of politics and they do it well like
really well
to good effect so on that level aoc and
trump are the same person
they both understand things at a i would
say a higher level
because they understand the importance
of the show you know that's how that's
how i like to call it
trump is always doing a show even when
he's really doing the work of government
it's also still a show and that's what
aoc understands better than
anybody else on the democrat side so the
fact that aoc
would have the political
brain to know that the smartest thing
she could do is
back the president or and vice versa so
they would both know
that the the the the coolest
best smartest thing that they could do
would be to back each other
it's dogs and cats uh sleeping together
you can't ignore this news all right
what makes news
is things that aren't supposed to happen
happening so they both knew that this
would be news it'd be good for them
it's it's the show so aoc and president
trump
for the close of the show let's call
2020 the show
they brought a really good close to the
show
i don't know how this is going to turn
out but it looks like it's going to work
it looks like president trump did what
he does
he waits for the the best leverage point
which is when it's so late that people
don't want to
argue because they want to go home so
trump is using
the deadline which you always have to
use when you're negotiating
if you don't have a deadline you should
create an artificial one if you're
negotiating with somebody
because people don't get serious until
deadlines we're just built that way
so trump waits until the deadline is
basically
almost past like he got he got so close
to the deadline
before throwing in his you know giant
stink bomb
that just not much time which is
really smart it's really smart
now if he pulls it off it's smart if it
doesn't work you're going to say he
wasn't smart
but at least you'll get your 600 dollars
you know so it won't get worse
so president trump has a way that he
won't make anything worse
but he could make it better that's the
ideal strategy you won't make it worse
might make it better pairing with aoc
makes him
makes him leave office as somebody who
wasn't so
so uh divisive right it's perfect for
his legacy it's perfect for the show
it's perfect for the people but here's
the thing i wanted to get to
how do you pick the right amount well
i'm going to give you a lesson on that
because one of the other things that aoc
and president trump have in common
is an understanding of business and
economics aoc has a degree
in some kind of economics president
trump has some degree in some kind of
business
thing plus all this experience so in
terms of their talent stacks
these are two people who understand
economics
they understand the show and they
understand politics
pretty good package for both of them
but i also have a background in
economics
so i thought it would be useful to
explain how to select
from let's say a list of possible checks
that you could write to the
people of the united states during a
coronavirus and here's how you do it
so let's say you have three choices and
this is roughly the choices that we did
have
and you're looking at these and you're
saying which from an economic
perspective and a political perspective
and anything else which is the right
number
and let me teach you how to do this
because this this is a little tricky
and i i hope you'll bear with me because
there's a little bit of math involved
i know you didn't expect math but i'll
try to keep it simple
you know it's complicated by its nature
but here's the trick
it's sort of an algorithm and this will
work every time watch this
what you do is you look at these numbers
and then you look for
the size of them all right so if you
were saying to compare this one to
this one it seemed to be 600 to 1200
you and this is an obvious this is why
you have me
this one is a bigger it's a it's a
larger number
and that's better than the the smaller
number
now the first time you see this it's not
going to be so obvious so i have to give
you another example maybe
you can start to see the pattern so
stick with me stick with me
then let's say if we were to compare two
different numbers let's say a twelve
hundred dollar check
to let's say a two thousand dollar check
how would you know which is the right
one well again
use your algorithm all right i know it's
math but
use your algorithm and determine which
of these is the larger
larger number and if you can determine
what that is and i'm gonna i'll
i'm gonna jump ahead you don't need to
do calculators but the larger number of
these two
is the 2000 it's actually the 2000.
so if you were to compare the a to the b
you'd pick a now if you were to compare
b
to c you'd pick b why
in the comments tell me why yeah that's
right it's the bigger number
it's the larger number that's that's how
you
employ the algorithm but now here's the
test
i don't know if everybody's paid
attention yet but
now here's the comparison if you get
this one right i think you have the
concept
what if what if hold on what if
this is your final exam what if your
choices were
two thousand dollars and
six hundred go in the comments
which uh use your algorithm uh you all
you can use your calculators at home if
you need to this is a test where you can
use your calculator
yeah the that's right i've seen a lot of
you are getting the right answer
the right answer is a
do you know why it's the big one yeah
it's larger it's a larger amount of
money
let me explain this to the people in
congress
because apparently all of congress
couldn't figure this out
but they don't have the right talent
stack right aoc has got some talent
president trump has a lot of talent in
his stack so they saw this immediately
i had to work on it a little bit i have
to admit when i first heard this story i
was like
god how did they even decide these
things
i don't know where to start but
eventually you know i started digging in
and then i learned the algorithm and i
was like oh
oh you could just pick the big one
now you're probably saying to yourself
but what about the downside
because it's not all upside right if you
pick the big one
doesn't that create like extra debt and
stuff
aren't we a little bit past the extra
debt problem
because if you let's compare these two
things
the two thousand dollars is some extra
debt
on top of a lot of extra debt
all right so it's a little extra debt on
top of a giant pile of extra debt
which matters right you don't want to
you don't want it to be the last straw
but if the giant pile of extra debt
isn't going to kill you already probably
the difference between 600 and 2000
won't kill you
which is the better political decision
let's say you told the public hey public
we're looking to save the people in the
worst shape
and we're thinking of three numbers 2
000
which would put you in pretty good shape
1200
not so bad 600 well that's not so good
and we've decided we thought about it
we've decided
on this one what do you think public
no no i know you think it's the little
one yeah yeah yeah i get it i know you
wanted the big number
but we rich people have gotten together
and we've decided that you poor people
given the options
yeah you're better off with a small
number what
yeah yeah i know you don't understand
but the big number would also increase
the debt and that's bad for you too
but wait a minute who pays off the debt
poor people are the people are the poor
people who get a check
the exact same people who are going to
be paying off this debt
well in an indirect way yes if the
economy suffers
but in a direct way poor people don't
pay debt
it's rich people the people who can
afford to pay taxes pay taxes
it's not the people who didn't make any
money they don't pay any taxes
so if you're a rich person in congress
and you and the public is watching you
decide how much
rich people are going to suffer
effectively
because they're the ones who will have
higher taxes to pay off any debt
if there is any higher taxes to pay off
any debt because we're in this weird
situation with low
with low uh inflation where you can kind
of just print money
but we don't know how far we can take
this nobody really does but we're just
sort of printing money and getting away
with it so far
anyway uh you don't want to tell people
if you were a rich person in congress
you don't want to tell them that you
considered
2 000 but you decided you know what's
good for poor people is 600 because we
rich people don't want to pay extra
taxes in the future
not during a pandemic in normal times
yeah in normal times everybody's being
selfish and
arguing for what's good for their group
that's just politics
is this just politics did i use the word
pandemic
yet this is a pandemic
this isn't regular politics so you don't
do regular politics during a pandemic
do you know who was smart enough to know
that you don't do regular politics
during a pandemic
aoc she was smart enough to know
that you don't do regular politics in a
freaking pandemic
do you know how once was smart enough to
know that elon omar
uh representative tulabe all right now
i'm probably going to spend
you know a few years mocking and
insulting those same people that i just
praised but
unambiguously they are the smart ones in
the room
with president trump you
the the four of them have just proven to
you
that they're smarter at least they're
willing to do what the people need
all right that's pretty impressive
pretty impressive and so i would like to
i just want to call this out as an
amazing way to stop uh to end 2020 the
worst you know the worst year ever in my
opinion
and to see to see our leaders
on opposite sides find this common
ground
that is unambiguously the right decision
yeah tulsi
gabbard ii is saying the same thing uh
all right somebody's saying but aoc
voted yes
on the bill that is not a good point
so anybody who says but aoc is
complaining about the bill
but she also voted for it that is not a
good point
because when she voted for it she said
that this is a hostage situation
and there's not enough time to fix it so
we're going to take a bad bill
over no bill that's not the wrong
decision
on top of that she was working behind
the scenes to see if they could augment
it with an amendment
which she did now if somebody complains
about something and then puts in the
work
she put in the work she didn't just
complain about it
she put in the work they made an
amendment they got the president to
agree with it
now i don't know what's going to happen
with the vote that's good work
that's good work all right
um here's uh
so we've got a bunch of pardons coming
and
uh one of the pardons the pardons are
not very interesting because it's you
know there'll be a bunch of
uh people who did bad things that maybe
or too many
republicans getting uh getting out you
have to assume that every one of these
stories has some kind of an
advocate who's who's making it easy for
them to get where they need to go
so i'm not too interested in the
individual cases of who's getting
pardoned
in this case but one of them really
jumped out and it illustrates a point
i've been trying to make
so there was this representative collins
uh and he was i guess the first member
of congress to endorse trump but then he
got a little trouble
and uh he got sentenced to over two
years in
federal prison for admitting uh he
helped his son
dodge 800 000 in stock market losses
when he learned that a drug trial by a
far
small pharmaceutical company had failed
in other words
insider trading so insider trading means
you have some secret
knowledge that the public doesn't and
you use it to buy or sell stocks
in a way to make profit now here's the
point i want to make about that and i'm
going to generalize the situation
if you have a situation where it's
possible to cheat it's private
meaning that nobody's watching when it
happens in this case it was probably a
private phone call or conversation with
collins and
his son so it was private in the sense
that it's not
happening right out with cameras
watching and
so if it's possible and profitable
and private how often does crime happen
and here's what i'm adding to it the ppp
that it's
the crime is possible it's private
meaning it's hard to discover
and it's profitable like really really
profitable
under those three conditions how often
does massive crime happen every time
not sometimes not most of the time
not a lot of the time a hundred percent
of the time
if you have the ppp it's possible it's
private and it's profitable
yeah it's gonna happen in fact it's so
easy to do that i can't figure out how
he got caught
if you dug into the story you'd probably
find that the way they caught him was
probably
some coincidence or accident right
because i would imagine that this exact
crime is massively being
perpetrated all over the financial world
just massively
i'll bet insider trading is i wouldn't
be surprised if
dollar wise it's almost as big as legal
trading
we would just wouldn't know right
um it's it is it's legal if only he was
a
congress person i don't know what that
means
um so pelosi is waiting to hear from the
house on the two thousand dollar checks
so yeah so i think that what's happening
is the house is working on the
the check thing and by the way if they
don't come out with exactly two thousand
dollars for the check
i'm gonna be surprised because
because there's one right answer now
because the the people have watched this
right the
the the public has watched and if you
put forth the 2000 number and you're
serious about it
you don't have an option to go lower you
don't
because you've already sold the 2000 the
public is saying oh i think i might get
2 000.
and i might need it you kind of have to
go with that number now
okay um anyway so my point on the
crimes that are possible private and
profitable is that whenever that happens
you can guarantee there's crime
that is the exact situation with our
election
system is our is it possible to cheat in
our elections
yes we you know we can't know how much
cheating happens in our election but i
don't think there's any adult
who hasn't learned this year that
cheating is possible
i mean it's certainly possible to hack
software right is anybody
arguing that it's impossible to hack a
software
i don't have any evidence that happened
but it's not impossible
it's probably pretty easy for somebody
motivated enough
so is the election system private in the
sense that there are things which happen
which are not observed
well that's exactly what happened there
were things that were happening that
were not observed
in the election system so it's possible
to cheat
if there are lots of places where it's
not observed and it's super profitable
in this case profit being power you know
they're sort of similar
you can trade power for money you can
trade money for power
so power and money are are substitutes
so what are the odds that our election
system
is not riddled with fraud zero
zero there isn't any chance there isn't
any chance at all
that our election system is not riddled
with fraud
we just don't know how much and how much
of a difference it made that's the hard
part
a lot of people who don't understand how
things work
are complaining that there's too much
pork in the omnibus bill
in other words it's the the coronavirus
bill has lots of stuff in it and
everybody throws their little thing into
it
and so the public hears this and says
says wait a minute
what does giving money to pakistan for
gender
studies how does that help us
fight coronavirus in the united states
are we just wasting all our money with
this
pork well here's the thing people don't
understand about our system
the the trading for this pork is the
only thing that gets anything done
if you took the pork out i don't know if
anything would get done
the pork is unfortunately how you bribe
people who weren't inclined to vote for
you so you might
say uh senator whatever i know you want
to vote against this because it would be
bad for you
for re-election but suppose
just suppose we also funded a military
project in your state that created a lot
of jobs
now the senator says uh okay you bribed
me
you know we need military bases anyway
so we're gonna build it somewhere
so you might as well put it in my state
how about some money for a foreign
country
does it ever make sense to give any
money to another country
i don't know do you do you know anything
about this
uh gender gender research
money or whatever it is for pakistan i
don't
if somebody were to bring you just that
case and say look we got this special
case
over in pakistan there are some people
we can influence
and if we give them what they want which
is this thing
they will be our friends in the
government and we're going to need some
friends in the pakistan government
for fighting you know terrorism and
everything else so really think of this
as a small investment
to essentially bribe some people in
foreign countries
that are critical to our success now if
somebody brought you that
individually and said you know i think
we
we've got a clever way to bribe somebody
we're going to do it through this
program
they've got some way there's going to
skim some money off and
basically it's going to look like we're
doing one thing but really we're just
bribing somebody in the government and
it's good for us
now i'm not saying that any of that had
anything to do with this pakistan thing
what i'm saying is that if you were to
hear the arguments individually
they might be pretty good for the
foreign stuff anyway
so we hope that our government is
picking
really you know laser-like opportunities
where a relative little about a month
little amount of money
would get us some big impact and if we
don't do it china will bribe
the same people so if we're not drug if
we are not bribing pakistan
china will do you want that do you want
china to have more influence on
pakistan for example
so uh the way that all the horse trading
happens is
one senator will say well i'm not going
to vote for this unless i get
this thing or that thing and those
things are not necessarily bad
now if your senator is putting in some
something that really doesn't have any
value
well that's bad that's bad but
as long as they're picking things that
individually would be good
i wouldn't worry about them being summed
up in a big omnibus because that's just
the only way you get anything done it's
not it's not ideal but i don't know if
there's a better way to do it
so governor newsome in california has
selected a replacement for
kamala harris so the governor gets to
pick a temporary
senator when a senator is removed
between elections
and he has decided that he would pick
the son of mexican immigrants
uh alex padilla so he's picked a
uh hispanic son of immigrants to be the
sitting senator
and what did mayor london breed
say about this she said that it's
definitely this is a real blow to the
african-american community
breed said uh and i thought to myself
this is such a bad politics imagine
you're in california
and i think this is true that there are
more hispanic
residents of california than black
that's true isn't it
give me a fact check on that while we're
waiting but in either case
they are big big minority populations
they should have as much
uh as much representation as possible we
i think everybody's in favor of that
on a general level we're in favor that
but
complaining about an hispanic american
a son of mexican immigrants getting the
job instead
of a black person replacing a black
person
is as tone deaf as you can get
that is really tone deaf and do you know
who never makes this
a mistake obama
i i say this all the time one of the
things that makes obama
one of the great politicians of our time
is that he ran for president
he was black but he didn't run for
being our black president brilliant
he so easily could have made a big deal
about the fact that
i'm the only uh i'm the first black
president uh you need me
nobody else will do it for you but he
didn't so obama is
gifted and smart on this stuff and
mayor breed of oakland is the opposite
she is neither gifted nor smart
on this stuff all right and let me
explain
more conceptually what i'm talking about
so let's say you want to have less
racism in your country
good idea and you need a strategy
what i'd like to add to that is that you
would use a different strategy
based on how big the problem is so
uh just conceptually not drawn to scale
i said
the white experience in the united
states has always been good
if you're in the united states and
you're white
good for you you've had a pretty good
experience the whole way
some will argue that it's getting worse
but let's just say it's been a good
experience if you're white in this
country
now let's say you're black and what is
your experience
of let's say the black uh history well
you started with slavery
that's as bad as it can be and that's
the the biggest gap you could get
between the white experience and the
black experience would be slavery
the tool you would need to fix that is a
civil war
big problem big tool as things improve
maybe you need a civil rights movement
which is really about
employing the law to close the gap and
let's say that did a good job and
closed a little bit more of the gap but
of course you know you're never going to
get to
exact equal life doesn't work that way
but you can
keep getting closer and closer i would
argue that the third phase
the tool that you use should not be a
war
it should not be necessarily the law
you're going to use the law where it
makes sense
but it's a persuasion play president
trump i'm sorry
president obama knew where he was
in history he knew he was in the
persuasion phase
and he knew that the very best thing he
could do for black america
is run for president as a black man and
don't mention it
now he didn't mention it and you know a
few times it came up but it was never a
theme
president obama understood that running
away
no i wouldn't say he ran away from it
but he didn't emphasize
that he's the first black president that
is a plus a plus
that's how you close the gap this last
gap
doesn't get closed by complaining and it
doesn't get closed by
rules changes that favor any group we're
at the point where if you
make a rule change the favor as a group
it might work against you
so everything that you did back here
would be
anti-productive at the moment and if you
don't understand that shift
or where you are in history you can't be
an obama level persuader which i would
consider
at the highest level of being good at
that so
mayor breed take a lesson from uh obama
who really has something to teach you on
this
i've told you before that one way to
predict the future is understanding the
insurance
market because things which can't be
insured
eventually go away because if you can't
insure something they will
sooner or later they will get sued out
of business
right it's just a guarantee because the
reason that you can't insure something
is that there's too much risk so if you
watch the insurance market you can often
tell
in advance what's going to happen and
here's a story that really signals in
advance what's going to happen
apparently detroit the city of detroit
has filed a lawsuit against black lives
matter
activists didn't see that coming did you
and they allege that that there was a
civil conspiracy
and they say that the protests in
detroit quote have repeatedly turned
violent endangering the lives of police
and the public
and that the activists the black lives
matter activists
were participated in a conspiracy to
quote
that defamed the mayor and police and
they say that the city should be awarded
damages
now who bet that by the end of 2020
detroit would be suing black lives
matter
didn't see that coming did you now what
happens if they win
if they win black lives matter has to
give up all their money
or some money right it's going to be
pretty expensive
and then what would black lives matter
do to
avoid the other cities from successfully
suing them
they try to get insurance but they
wouldn't be able to get it
they can't get insurance i'm guessing
right
now i'm not an insurance agent but i'm
guessing
that if you're an insurance company
you're not going to give any insurance
to
the black lives matter activists who are
taking people to the street
and destroying things if detroit wins
imagine what will happen if detroit
actually gets some money from black
lives matter
do they have a case feels like they
don't it feels like they do
right because you could have argued that
the organizers of black lives matter
could not have known there would be
violence in the beginning
that's fair to say you don't want to get
rid of freedom of speech
just because there might be some
violence in our country we don't say
that's a good enough reason
but over time once the leaders of these
groups could
clearly see that promoting uh some
movement in the city would
destroy lots of stuff and get people
hurt once it was obvious that that was
going to happen
what's more important freedom of speech
or does detroit have a point
that it was organized and they could
have known for sure
that it was going to cause this damage
this is a big one this could be the end
of black lives matter
it could be the end of i don't know if
it could be the end of antifa because
you need a leadership
somebody specific in charge i guess
so the united states military has
announced a new
upgrade in their tank cannon systems
so they've got this big ass cannon that
they can put on a tank
that will shoot a i don't know what
you'd call a round
or a shoe some kind of munitions um
43 miles and hit an exact target
you believe that i mean i believe it but
it's unbelievable
we have the technology to to put a tank
on the field that will shoot a munition
43 miles and and it says hit
hit a target now i don't know what a
target means at 43 miles
does that mean you could hit another
tank i mean is the target that small
could you had a building at 43
miles away you could specify a building
i don't know
if i were going to build this system
this is how i do it
i don't know if this is possible so you
you engineers tell me if you can do it
if you didn't want your munitions to be
rockets
where they're self-propelled rockets so
you wanted to do it cheaper
i would make munitions that were
semi-smart
so it's not as smart as a rocket but it
can do one thing
you fire at 43 miles and it's mostly in
the air
and and your your initial firing just
gets it sort of in the range
of your specific target and then once
it's up there and it's starting to fall
and it starts to lose altitude could you
put enough electronics
in the municipal munitions so that the
only thing it does is move its fins
so that it's you know it's pretty high
in the air so it's got lots of time to
adjust
to an exact gps strategy is that how
they designed it because that's how i
would have done it i would have done it
so it's just a
it's launched high above the target but
then once it's up there
it has enough time to adjust to find the
specific target
and it wouldn't need any uh it wouldn't
need any kind of
jet engine because it's being shot out
of the
cannon anyway do you think that makes a
big difference
that we've got a tank that can shoot 43
miles
well it's not really going to help us
against the superpower is it
it might it might help a lot against
let's say if there's another isis
flare up it might help a lot but i don't
see it helping against
you know russia or china because a tank
is only going to last a minute and a
half
in a war against superpowers
there's a i guess there's a provision in
the new omnibus bill
for a 10-year penalty for
streaming other people's copyrighted
content
now you can go to jail for 10 years uh
but you'd have to be
in the business of you know streaming a
lot of it it's not for somebody who just
has some music on in the background
it's not for you know trivial cases of
some user has some copyrighted material
it's not about that it's about a big
ongoing system that just takes your
copyrighted material and uses it
such as let's say adding uh let's say
if i live streamed and i played somebody
else's music as my opening
and i didn't pay them for it then i
would be
subject to this i think and as a creator
i say
maybe that's not a bad idea i don't know
it's not as bad as it sounds
here's an example of a phenomenon i talk
about in wind bigly that you can get
used to anything
one of the most basic elements of being
a human
is that no matter what is happening yeah
you can get used to it
it could be something terrible yeah just
get used to it
here's here's a clean example uh
horrible it's a horrible example and
tragic so
i think it was yesterday that 3 400
americans died from
the coronavirus 3 400 people in one day
that's bigger than 9 11. we have the
equivalent
of a 9 11 death count every day
now when 9 11 happened and
3 000 plus people died all at once
how did that change your day completely
your brain was changed your life was
changed the country was changed
your your uh your wealth was changed
it changed a lot the whole freaking
world changed because of those three
thousand whatever people on 9 11.
but here we are in the coronavirus and
it's you know in in less than a year
we've become numb to 3 400 people dying
a day
from what might have been china mischief
at least a china mistake
maybe a little more intention in it than
we know we don't know
no direct evidence of that
but we actually got used
we just got used to it now i'm not
really making a point about this
right it's not about the coronavirus and
it's not about 911 it's a larger point
that if you're trying to predict
one of the things you can always predict
it's very consistent
is that whatever is going on we'll get
used to it
we're practically getting used to masks
i'm definitely not used to that yet
but i feel like i'm getting there you
know you just get used to anything
so let me see if i've talked about
everything i want to talk about here
today because i think it did
i think it did yep i think you did
okay looks like we did a good job
somebody says 8 000 people die every day
anyway that is not a good point
because the uh we
often make this mistake it was like on
day one of uh let's say the aids
epidemic
so it's day one of the aids epidemic
only three people died
let's just say hypothetically only three
people died of aids
so therefore we can ignore aids right
only three people died
8 000 people died of other things only
three people died of aids
so just ignore it right no you don't
ignore
a little problem that is guaranteed to
become a big problem if you ignore it
it's guaranteed it's you know it's a
virus
there's no way it's not going to get
bigger so when you say
but scott you know that 3 400 is much
less than the 8 000 people who die every
day
i say that's true but the reason the 3
400 is still news is that we have to do
everything we can to make to not make
that
10 000 a day right
um somebody says blm is hidden their
money in offshore accounts well i hope
they have by now
will i do i'm being asked if i'll do one
of these on 7 a.m
on christmas day to which i say
do i look lazy of course i'm going to be
doing it on christmas day
better question is will i be doing it on
7 a.m
new year's day after all my partying on
new year's night
yeah i'll be partying until i don't know
maybe nine or ten o'clock that night
so i think i'll be up on time um
somebody says the u.s death rate for
2020 is not
changed i believe you'll find that is
fake news
it's change i believe you'll find that
the death rate
is higher and it is coronavirus and news
that you see that suggests
otherwise is probably fake uh not
probably fake it is fake
the death count is higher that's just a
fact
if anybody has any different evidence
than that it's probably from a bad
source
um will i dress as santa
i might be wearing a santa hat um
apologist somebody oh
your son is getting married today on
zoom congratulations um
somebody says fewer people died in 2020
than 2019.
well uh i doubt that's true
um a lot of the evidence you or a lot of
the data that you see especially
especially on social media
you'll see a chart that says hey deaths
are the same as
or less than last year those charts are
generally
if not all of them are bad or fake so i
wouldn't believe any of them
and elisa happy birthday
um have i filled christina's stocking
well i i sure did
that was just last night well
uh let's know for now do i count
abortions and death that's a perfectly
reasonable question
i don't but it's a reasonable question
um all right that's it for now
that is it for now and i will talk to
you tomorrow
just kidding i was only talking to the
periscope people that i just turned off
i'm not done with you yet
um somebody's saying i
made a deal with youtube so i could stay
on the channel just to clarify
the only the only thing that youtube did
to me that was in the news
was uh they suppressed one video
right a number of them have been
demonetized in the past they're they're
demonetizing far fewer of them at the
moment which is good that's progress
but there was one video in particular
that was a kick
that was suppressed
all right why is why is somebody
uh why are so many people mentioning q
paul you keep mentioning q and i don't
know why
uh if there's a question there let me
know
let's see your decorations downstairs
please
oh okay you want to go for a walk
let's go for a walk i'll show you my
decorations
let me take off that
all right come with me
i'll give you a little extra

he did i would take that very seriously

all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
