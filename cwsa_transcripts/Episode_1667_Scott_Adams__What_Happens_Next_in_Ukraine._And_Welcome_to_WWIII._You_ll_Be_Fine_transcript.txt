good morning everybody
and welcome to not only the best place
in the world
at the best time
but also the safest
according to science
no one has ever died in world war three
while watching this live stream
if you don't believe it do your own
research you'll find out it's true
and how to make sure that you're as safe
as possible on the inside as well as the
outside
well you might need a copper mug or a
glass a tanker gels inside a canteen jug
or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
beverage i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing that makes
every damn thing better it's called the
simultaneous
sep
live from switzerland
good to have you here switzerland join
me now go
so switzerland
you feeling neutral now
or are you feeling
a little more than neutral
well let's talk about all the things
happening today uh let's see uh
anything happening today
checking notes uh oh uh world war three
broke out
what would be the definition of a world
war
wouldn't it be a war
that involved basically all the
industrialized countries of the world in
a substantial way now keep in mind that
even in world war ii
most of the citizen population of the
world
did not get shot
you know 60 million people did die in
world war ii so
that's not nothing
but
most people
had had an impact financially or
otherwise
and
i think we're in world war iii
because the global financial markets
have decided
to hell with the global energy markets
and you can see the
financial markets start to close in on
on russia
which will probably impact energy which
will impact all of us which will impact
inflation which will impact
all kinds of stuff i think we get a lot
of fertilizer from russia
you know there's a lot of
you know grain that comes out of the
ukraine for the world
so
there's a lot there's a lot going on
here
but would you agree with me
would you agree with me
that this could legitimately be called a
world war iii
because i don't know how you define it
other than a war that
substantially affects everybody
which is what's happening right now
so yes now it's a matter of opinion all
right
uh we are of course in the uh fog of war
and
i recommend you
uh
follow mike cernovich
whenever we're in the fog of war
one of the reasons is that he will
remind you over and over again not to
believe stuff that really you shouldn't
believe
and he's doing a good job of that
especially during this ukraine thing
there there are some things i think i've
i think i'm guilty of tweeting some
things
they're probably not really
accurate
and
and so you know he's helping me keep my
guard rails on as well
so follow
just follow somebody
who can remind you
not to believe what you see
for a while i'm not sure you'll ever you
should never believe it
but for a while it's real helpful to
have people do that
so that's you know quite a service he's
providing at the moment
so here are some things which maybe you
shouldn't believe
but maybe you should i don't know
do you remember the video was it snake
island the little island
where the
uh the alleged ukrainian
fighters said fu to the russian warship
and then the russian warship
killed them
all i don't know if that happened
but i kind of believed it when i first
saw it
but then after reading some of
cernovich's tweets i thought hmm
not necessarily
so i'm going to put that one in the
maybe
but not
not
i'm not confident enough in it to say
that it really happened
but it could have maybe
shouldn't change anything one way or the
other but
that's the level of uh propaganda we're
going to see
speaking of which is this propaganda
or does marco rubio know something
that you don't know
so rubio tweeted this yesterday
i wish i could share more but for now i
can say it's pretty obvious to many
that something is off with putin
he has always been a killer but his
problem now is different and significant
it would be a mistake to assume this
putin would react the same way he would
have five years ago
now
is marco rubio
tied into
enough of the intelligence apparatus
to know that he has good intel from
behind the scenes
that there's something up with putin and
he can't tell you how he knows it
is that what's happening or
is marco rubio
engaged in propaganda
which would be quite productive actually
because one would assume he had access
to insider information
i i
what committees is he
marco rubio which which committees is he
on
that would give him access
and i i'm not even sure he'd need to be
on the committee because he could hear
stuff without being on a committee
is he on senate
intelligence foreign relations
all right well i don't know but whatever
he's on he's not i'm pretty sure he's on
something that gives him access
however you should not believe that he
necessarily knows something credible
what you should believe is that even if
he didn't know something credible
this is probably a good way to act
because everybody's saying anything in
public especially people who have a big
platform some kind of position like
rubio does
are they neutral in this war
is it is it marco rubio's job to tell
you something accurate
or should he tell you something that
might be good for ukraine
because it's world war iii
what is his obligation
in
in normal times i would say his
obligation is to give it to us straight
but does he have a bigger obligation to
win you know to to help the good guys
win whoever the good guys are
that's a good question
because i'm not entirely sure what is
the moral or ethical way to play this if
he imagined that simply suggesting that
putin was
different in whatever way you wanted to
imagine which would be bad for putin
whatever it was
maybe it doesn't need to be true
am i right
because this is a very unique situation
this is one situation where
if your government's going to lie to you
sometimes all you ask is that they had a
good reason
i know some of you are absolutists about
honesty and i get that
it's a perfectly reasonable point of
view
but
in the real world
people also look at what the total
impact of things is going to be in the
total cost of things and it could be
that our own government has decided that
just bullshitting us totally on what's
going on
might be good for the world in
somebody's legitimate opinion
so don't trust it automatically
um
and that brings
that brings me to me
all right you're all watching this
uh and if you've watched me for a while
you i hope
have come to the conclusion
that i will try to be objective on
pretty much everything
i'm not objective on the question of
fentanyl in china
but you know why right i'm fully
transparent about that
however
i don't know if i could be completely
unbiased
in the context of
literally being part of a world war
and so i'm going to give you that
warning
that i feel like it's fair warning
let me know if this goes too far or not
far enough
i feel as if
i can't
i can't promise you that i will
intentionally try to be unbiased talking
about ukraine and russia
i just can't promise you that
but i want you to know that
right so that's
i don't know
maybe there's just no way to play this
completely ethically
because the most ethical thing to do
would be whatever you know helps the
most people
but how do i know
who knows maybe the truth is the only
thing that helps people
maybe i mean that would be a perfectly
reasonable view
so
um just be cautious just be cautious
when you listen to me on this topic
the same way you should be cautious
about
every other person
just just bring the same skepticism to
everything i say
and just know that you're doing it with
my my full awareness and permission
this is one where you got to watch me
carefully okay
just so you know
all right
um
i did a poll
on twitter
which
again is my totally unbiased approach to
this
watch how unbiased i am
in my poll i gave people four choices
for uh what was the reason for putin's
apparent change you know a lot of people
saying he's changed we won't say that's
true
but a lot of people are saying it marco
rubio being one
you see fox news pundits say it and a
number of people said it
and i've said it as well it just looks
like it to me
but uh 11 of people thought maybe drugs
were involved
18
said mental health and by the way this
is not a scientific poll this is just my
twitter followers
uh 36 said it was just war propaganda
so it'd be people like me people like
marco rubio maybe just
trying to bias things with the
suggestion that he's he's insane
uh and you would expect that our
intelligence agencies would be trying to
do that as well
and then 36 percent i'm so proud of you
i really am
36 said confirmation bias
is that a healthy sign or what
now
of course i primed you by putting that
choice there in the first place
so you know it's not scientific and i
primed you for it but still 36
i find that really encouraging
because it because it means people are
sort of hyper aware
of that effect in a way that we we're
always aware
but there's a really difference there's
a big difference
between being aware that confirmation
exists
and being hyper aware which means you
can even watch it in yourself
you can watch it in real time oh that's
confirmation bias it's different
and i would say that something really
really healthy
is happening at least among the people
who are following me
and that 36 would just automatically go
to that because you know what
if you were going to bet
you know if you saw how the the public
released this limited unscientific
sample of the public
if you saw how they answered and then i
said to you all right now now cast your
bet
if you have some magical way to know the
truth later
which one do you bet on
i feel like i'd bet on confirmation bias
would you
but even though that's not my opinion my
opinion is drugs
my opinion is drugs
because it looks like it
which is not a good enough reason right
so i'm pitting
i guess
my cumulative
life's knowledge
about why people change and how they
change and what drugs do to people and
what kind of people would be on what
kind of drugs
so
i'm kind of bringing together like a
whole bunch of
parts of my skill stack if i could put
it that way
and and my opinion is
i
my opinion sides with the smallest
number of the public
that is drugs
now it might also be mental health
but i'm sure drugs are involved
i would say the odds that he's not on
some kind of drug
that is known to affect your
cognitive
or personality or something the odds of
that are really small in my opinion
doesn't mean it's the whole story
there's lots a lot of variables involved
but i'm pretty sure drugs are involved i
think that's going to be one of the
stories here
on top of perhaps some health issues as
well
but if i had to bet on it i would bet
against myself
does that make sense
if i had to put my actual money on it i
would bet against my own opinion that i
hold quite firmly
because i'm also aware
the confirmation bias is usually right
i hate to say it
it's hugely right
that's why it's so important to know
about it because that's usually right
all right so
um how about
everybody's predictions so far
can i ask you in the comments
was there one other person in the
public domain
who told you that the russian army might
be surprised
by the uh let's say the effectiveness of
the weapons
that ukraine would bring against the
invasion
was there anybody else who told you i
think you might be surprised
i think it was just me
oh sticks and hammer did
anybody else
now
um
in in all caps
i'm being asked do you believe that and
the answer is
no
now when i read the stories that say
that ukraine has
you know
is unexpectedly successful
is it too early
to say that that's true
yes it's way too early
because
um it took i guess a couple weeks for
even the u.s forces to overrun what
fallujah and baghdad or whatever so it
actually could take a few weeks
for a proper
you know control of a city
and the russian army may have sent in
some
probes just to test the defense and now
they're assembling the resources they
need based on what they've learned
and it might take a week
and then they'll encircle the city isn't
taking over
that's possible
so do you believe the reports
that seem to agree with your
confirmation bias
that ukraine is
is putting up a big fight and it's
working
what do you think
okay fallujah was the wrong
wrong example
what do you think i don't know what to
believe yet
but i would say it's way too soon for me
to say yes they were surprised by better
weaponry than they
imagined however
how good do you think an anti-tank
missile is
if if somebody is hiding at a reasonable
distance
and the person hiding can see the tank
but the tank can't see them right away
does the tank missile
hit the tank
most of the time
i mean is it pretty much one missile
equals one tank
give or take is is the r equals one
one missile equals one tank pretty much
every time
because it seems to be that if you could
see a tank
and your missile knew how to find a tank
it would be hard to mistake attack with
anything else
yeah
and so
the thing that i i've been speculating
about is
is it possible to invade and hold a
country
that is a modern country
that has access to unlimited modern
weaponry
because it's coming across the border
and they have lots of friends
i feel as if it can't be done
because i feel as if you would need the
advantage of the
the troop transporters and the the tanks
and the heavy equipment
to hold the country right
and i think heavy equipment
all gets destroyed
if you have unlimited number of
handheld anti-tank
stuff
now i saw a bunch of uh data that i
don't believe
about how much got destroyed how many
tanks and troop transports and stuff and
they looked ridiculous
so i don't believe these numbers at all
coming from the ukraine side
so i don't believe they killed 4 800
russians that sounds too high i don't
believe they
blew up
706 troop transport vehicles
presumably with troops in them
i think the war would already be over
if russia lost 706 transport vehicles in
the first
you know
48 hours
so i don't believe those numbers
but
how many missiles do you think ukraine
has whatever the handheld anti-tank
things are called
how many do you think they have
tens of thousands right
if they have tens of thousands of these
shoulder mounted things and they and
they understand the landscape and they
know exactly where russia has to go to
get where it goes
because they're letting russia on the
roads
didn't you wonder why
ukraine didn't try to stop him at the
border like why would ukraine leave a
bridge
where they could just cross into the
country
it looks an awful lot like they wanted
russia to bring their heavy equipment
into the country
am i am i so bad at understanding
military strategy that that's stupid it
looks exactly like they suckered him
into a kill zone
meaning that there was no way this this
heavy equipment could ever reach a an
urban center
because they would have to go through an
unlimited number of
you know
of anti-tank
equipment
now
now i'm also saying that
maybe
some turkish drones were used
i saw some footage but you can't trust
any footage right don't trust any
military footage you see coming out of
this so
i don't know about that
but how many of those would they have
if turkey had been providing drones and
they're not positive that's true
how many do they have
because it seems like they could
have a lot
right
nobody ever talked about how much stuff
ukraine had defensively
because maybe nobody knew
yeah turkey is nato
but that doesn't mean that this is nato
involvement because anybody can sell
weapons
they may have just sold them
i assume
the bridges over the dinopur are still
there
so
how many of you think it looks like
ukraine suckered their heavy equipment
in and they just turned it into a kill
box
and they're they're just going to take
you
you know what it looks like
i'm seeing lots of no's
lots of no's
it could be just it wasn't a strategy
it's just the only thing they could do
because they couldn't stop them at the
border probably
um
yeah i mean maybe that's just a
description of guerrilla warfare so i
suppose i'm adding nothing to it it's
just a description of guerrilla warfare
everybody knew that would be the
strategy
uh and russia might have to run their
supply line that's right
so
here's what's interesting really a lot
of it's interesting in a tragic way
if ukraine can hold until monday
and markets open in russia
and just all the russian financial
assets tank
which it looks like is going to happen
that changes everything doesn't it
because that would show russia
that the rest of the world wasn't going
to let it
go uh scott russia is holding
capitulation talks with ukraine right
now
i don't think anything's going to happen
with that
do you
um
the russian stock market is tiny
somebody says well it matters to russia
i'm sure
so
i i saw somebody uh
tweeting a list of
photos and descriptions of all the
russian billionaires yachts
you know the really expensive
multi-billion dollar yachts
the russian i think the russian
oligarchs are absolutely screwed at this
point
screwed
here's the thing you probably didn't see
coming
and i didn't see it coming
but you know how we're talking about
russia is making a decapitation
run that the whole point was
to decapitate the government
am i wrong
that
putin and zelinski are racing for pink
slips at this point
do you recognize that analogy
zielinski and putin are racing for pink
slips
what i mean by that
is zelinski is as close to owning russia
as putin is to own a ukraine
you didn't see that coming did you let
me ask you something else hypothetically
isn't zelinski russian
wasn't he born in russia
can somebody give me a fact check on
that
was zelinski born in russia
yeah he has jewish background but that's
not as relevant at the moment
uh no southeast ukraine somebody says
all right so actually it doesn't matter
remember putin's whole point is that
russia and ukraine are the same country
right
you see where i'm going with this
if you race for pink slips and you lose
and your your entire argument was that
ukraine and russia are the same country
but you've got two leaders
you've got zielinski you've got putin
but there's only one country
they're racist for pink slips
i think zielinski could either literally
or
maybe by influence
end up controlling russia
is that insane
you're saying you're nuts i'm not saying
it's likely
yeah i'm not going to say that's a 50
likelihood i'm saying that
you really can't predict what happens
with these things
how many of you thought nelson mandela
was going to be the
president of south africa
ah
suddenly doesn't look so crazy does it
right
the the the person who is beaten to a
pulp and survives
ends up being
you know a senator
someday looking at you know the huma the
uh civil rights movement in the united
states right if you get beaten to almost
death
but you survive
there's a good chance you're going to be
in charge someday that's just sort of
the way it works
now what are the odds that russians
would accept
zielinski as their leader pretty low
what are the odds that if putin failed
there wouldn't be just another oligarch
to take his place
pretty high
yeah i i think the odds are very small
but they exist
they actually exist
i think
vanishingly small that zelinski would be
actually literally the head of russia
but not vanishingly small that his
influence
could decide who gets who gets the job
if putin goes
i mean it could be that much influence
at that point
you were ranting today
yeah maybe navalny could be interesting
all right on the question of
is china being emboldened by this and
looking at taiwan and licking his chops
weren't all the smart people saying
just a week ago all the smart people
were saying
wow this is going to be a double move
china's going to see how easy this is
it'll make a move on taiwan
but what what happens if it turns out
that russia
gets destroyed by this
which is what's happening right now
and mark schneider pointed this out
in a tweet that ukraine shares a border
with russia
which makes invasion fairly practical
but taiwan is an island
so you'd have to do a naval
attack to control taiwan i mean you
could bomb the crap out of it but to
control it you need to do something on
the ground
to get to the ground you've got to cross
water
and as mark points out who used to serve
on submarines
that taiwan is an island china would
need to launch an amphibious assault
and supplies will need to cross water
and as mark points out one piece of
hardware makes that difficult
submarines
how many submarines are protecting
taiwan
and how many would it take
and i asked mark this question i haven't
seen if he responded yet but
do we know if submarines beat
anti-submarine or does an anti-submarine
beat a submarine in 2022
you know is the best anti-submarine
better than the
pretty good submarine
or is the best submarine
better than the best
anti-submarine
does anybody even know
because we've never had a war of the top
submarines have we
so i don't think we know
so
it'd be pretty hard for uh china to
have any kind of a land assault
um right
i'm starting to think that the
importance of twitter
and social media
is way beyond even our greatest
imagination
and what i mean by that is i wonder if
social media has formed sort of a
self-healing mechanism
for exactly something like the ukraine
russia situation now
self-healing things don't happen
immediately
like that it takes a while for them to
kick in
but are you not watching
social media
move governments in real time
that's what's happening right
isn't it social media it's not the news
it's i don't think it's the people in
the streets
as many as them as there are because
they haven't been there long enough
making enough noise to really make a
difference
but it seems to me
that because governments can immediately
see social media and they can read the
room
you know faster
i think you're seeing social media
seeing a cancer
which is putin attacking ukraine
i think social media recognizes as a
cancer on the body
and and you're watching social media
actually
form a healing protective
defensive shield
right
because social media is what allows
germany
to break its own rules and send you know
allow
allow their deadly weapons to go into
ukraine which just happened
social media
allowed banks and the swift thing to
happen or whatever is going to happen
there
because
the world could tell the social media
was going to support it
am i wrong it didn't matter what
everybody thought because most people
aren't paying attention
it mattered to us social media thought
because they're the ones really paying
attention moving opinions you know the
ones who have the the levers of society
so
we may be watching
something fairly miraculous
but also largely below our notice
which is that this is really a social
media war
with a kinetic component which starts
the whole thing
but i think i think the collective
actions of the world
as expressed through social media in
real time
are having a huge effect on this and i
can't imagine this would have been true
in any prior war
of
you know we don't have anything that's a
good analogy to this one actually
so
um
i guess the two big cities are
apparently repelling attacks
uh that part is probably true i think
we'd know if any major city
had had fallen
so i feel like we do know that it hasn't
happened yet if it's going to happen at
all
so here's the most interesting story
involving this vice pres the vice prime
minister of ukraine
and the minister of digital
transformation of ukraine
he tweeted to elon musk
he said while trying to colonize mars
uh russia tried to occupy ukraine while
your rockets successfully land from
space russian rockets attack ukrainian
civil people
we ask you now he's talking directly to
elon musk he says we ask you to provide
ukraine with starlink stations
these are the satellites that musk's
company uh has
and to address the same russians to
stand
and
within hours i think
elon musk tweeted back
starling service is now active in
ukraine
more terminals and route you need the
terminals to be able to access it so
they must be shipping those in
um
did that change things or is that my
imagination
i feel as if
there's no way to hold conquer and hold
the country under the following
conditions
and i think elon musk just provided the
last of the conditions that are
necessary
number one
the entire world is on your side
you know not the entire world but
even china doesn't seem to be on
russia's side they're they're watching
but basically nobody's on russia's side
at this point
really
so that's condition one that is
satisfied
condition two
you have borders which allow the rest of
the world to ship in unlimited amount of
uh
of uh you know deadly lethal force
that is satisfied
they have to have the willingness to do
it and the ability and they have that
then you need
communications
because
the best weapons in the world aren't
really that good even these great
shoulder-held
tank things unless
at least the military units can
communicate with each other and say hey
there's a unit coming this way
put you know
put your defenses here or there
it's possible that elon musk just
provided the last thing that ukraine
needs
to survive
on top of
incredible bravery apparently and the
leader who's
pretty smart about this so far
and is leading the way you would expect
or hope you'd hope a leader would lead
now of course you also can't believe
anything
about zelinski
right whatever we hear about him you
should also put the same skeptical hat
on you know don't don't believe he's
necessarily as awesome
we can find out anything later but at
the moment that's the narrative that's
holding
um
once again because my life is unusual i
became part of the story
about elon musk and starlink in ukraine
it's the weirdest thing i'm just
uh i'm sitting here in my my office
where i am every day
sending out tweets
and and then i see a daily wire uh
report that talks about elon musk and
starlink in ukraine
and then it mentions you know half a
dozen political commentators and it
mentioned my tweet
in which i said uh pushes a button and
changes the course of history
now
of course that's hyperbole
it takes more than pushing the button to
get this done
you know they got to get the terminals
there it's a pretty big operation one
one assumes
and
i do think it'll change the course of
history though
because
once dictators can't control
communications
everything changes
and if
if this is the way that the
resistance
can communicate well enough to use the
weapons that are being shipped in it
changes everything
but you know what else it changes
elon musk is in the fight now
so it gets better
if you thought this was awesome
just listen to this
so russia's
head of some space thing
starts basically threatening
that if you know russia is sanctioned
etc they might not have rockets to
resupply the
international space station
because russia had been supplying
rockets on a commercial basis
elon musk tweets back at him
spacex
that's it just the brand like like a
logo spacex
because if you aren't paying attention
elon musk's spacex company
has found out how to get stuff in space
cheaper
well at least safer
than the russian option
elon musk
not only provided communications for the
eur the ukrainian rebels
at about the same time
he took out
the entire russian space program
because if russia can't sell
sell its services i'm not sure they can
afford to do it anymore
so if musk takes away their ability to
charge outrageous amounts one assumes to
put stuff in space
because he can do it cheaper
elon musk just took russia out of space
maybe
i mean you know it's hyperbole right
but maybe
i mean
follow the money
how do they compete if he has a better
solution
and it looks like he does
do you know who doesn't bluff a lot
elon musk
he doesn't bluff a lot because he seems
to be able to back stuff up but you know
this isn't even the most important part
of the story
do you know what happens when elon musk
goes all in
everybody else does
because it looks like he's usually right
it just feels like it's safer now
he made it safer
and he also is unambiguous about it
he's very clear about his opinion on
this right by his actions he's very
clear
so i think
that when elon musk goes in it
influences governments
what do you think
i don't think anybody missed this story
i think it influences governments
i heard that uh there was a a pipe a gas
pipeline that got blown
now allegedly and again i'm very
skeptical about this story for obvious
reasons
uh apparently
ukraine is saying that russia blew up a
gas pipeline in
uh
near
kharkiv the largest and second largest
largest city
now i've been asking
why the ukrainians
don't threaten to blow up pipelines and
people kept saying no they're too well
protected
but the report is that the russians did
it
now i don't believe the report in part
because i don't know why they do it
because it seems like more something
ukraine would do
i don't know
but
um i guess the question of whether a
pipeline can be blown up may have been
answered so at least this one was
maybe
again don't believe it
uh even switzerland is starting to uh
have protests 20 000 people protested
and burned switzerland
because the government didn't put
sanctions on russia yet their banks
even
even switzerland
is not neutral at least the citizens the
i think the country is still kind of
neutral
the citizens
are mad at their own country for not
being neutral on this one
uh but here's something even more
interesting
um let's call them money twitter the the
people who know the most about finance
and also have big social media
followings
have also entered the fight
and what happens when you see
these names might not be as familiar to
you if you don't follow finance how many
of you know bill ackman
bill ackman head of giant hedge fund
so when he talks
the
the financial press almost always
reports anything he says so he's
important enough
that when he talks about anything
financial it's in the news
and what he tweeted today was
i wouldn't want to keep money in a bank
they can't access the swift system once
a bank can't transfer or receive funds
from other banks insolvency can be a
risk if i were russian i would take my
money out now
bank runs could begin in russia on
monday
and then he hashtag stand with ukraine
now remember
everybody's in the fight so i wouldn't
say that this was bill ackman being
completely objective in describing the
situation
although it might be i mean objectively
i don't think he's wrong
but the reason for it is influence
you're seeing one of the top guys in
finance directly try to take down the
russian economy
because if he says it's going down and
you should get your money out of the
bank
you should freaking listen to that
let me put it this way
if bill lachman told me
to get my money out of my bank
i'd be in my car
now of course you have to assume also
he's this is an influence operation
right
um
here's something that naval said today
uh anybody who's in the investing
community in the united states will
recognize naval
he said he tweeted ukrainian forces
benefiting from higher morale
superior intelligence via nato
and a quick and positive social media
cycle
and then he goes on russia has already
lost the media war and the economic war
may lose the physical war too
do you know what happens when naval
tells you you just lost an economic war
again
you know you might not be familiar with
naval and you might not be familiar with
bill ackman
but the people who move large amounts of
money sure know them
they know them
and the people who move large amounts of
money
if they hear naval say that russia
already lost the economic war and they
hear bill ackman say you better get your
money out of the bank today
in russia
i'll bet they're not the only people
saying this
i'm saying it
so you're seeing social media
form a
propaganda a propaganda
offensive weapon
that is in all likelihood going to take
down the russian economy on monday
and this is many of these are civilians
right the people i just mentioned
civilians
but social media gives civilians
gigantic
influence
if the topic fits those civilians now
civilians
in this case
the people who know the most about
economics and finance and the you know
the likely direction of business
some of the smartest ones in the
business just told you russia is in
trouble on monday
do you have i ever told you that
economies are mostly psychological
engines
um here's a good comment
so let me say my point so economies are
psychological engines and so they can be
taken down by psychology
so
a waking bear says this scott you're
acting like all these things you're
describing were not fully expected by
russia
no i'm not acting like it
i'm pretty sure
that they didn't expect all of it
i believe that they expected a lot of it
and i think that their expectations have
now been exceeded
i believe that the financial impact will
be
almost certainly almost certainly more
than they could have anticipated
now we're in the fog of war as as the
comments are reminding me remember you
have to keep me on this too right
as many times as i remind you not to
believe anything about this situation
keep reminding me too right every time i
say something with some certainty
feel free in the comments to say but fog
or
because that's always the right thing to
say
however
it's not my imagination that people who
know what they're talking about in the
financial world
are persuading against russia's economy
i'm not imagining that
and i'm not imagining that the economy
is built on psychology that's not
imagination
and not imagining that the entire world
minus china sending it out
seems to be against russia at this point
i'm not
you know i'm looking at things that you
agree with
this is really really dangerous for
russia
really dangerous
and i don't know that putin could have
ever imagined it would go this far
i'm surprised are you
so
now i think it's also fair to say
that when the top financial experts seem
fairly unified at this point in saying
that the
sanctions
by the way it was only 24 hours ago that
we said the sanctions were toothless
right
give me a fact check on this
one day ago
common knowledge was the sanctions were
toothless
today again fact-check me
today people are asking on social media
what happens if russia falls this week
financially and maybe politically and
the and the nukes are not secured
in one day
we went from
saying the sanctions were toothless
just saying it could bring down russia
in a week
fact-check me that really happened right
now it's not just swift
because there was also um
melissa was it the uh
who is it the uh
head of the economic head of the eu
whatever
apparently even um
their entire banking system in russia is
just going to be crashed
by
international action
so it's not just swift but swift is bad
enough even even though swift carved
down some of the energy things
it looks like
the other financial and banking
restrictions are just going to close
down the country now
what should you be saying to me right
now
right
so what you should be saying is
scott you don't know if these sanctions
are really going to be that strong
because there's always this there's
always a workaround and
you know they've got some they've got
some reserves and hey they anticipated
it
nobody can anticipate what happens when
the first bullets fly
nobody can the only you know you know
what is the safest prediction about
anything involving a war
is you don't know what's going to happen
that's the safest prediction
so
finance the financial markets don't like
uncertainty so they're definitely not
going to like monday
so here's what i would be looking for i
would be looking for
other people who are
financially astute
and have a high profile
to tell you that russia's economy is in
trouble on monday
that's your assignment for today
is to see how much of the let's say
classic media
or even social media let's see how many
of them weigh in
how many times will cnn have somebody on
who says you know
these financial sanctions really are
going to take down russia
because
even our
our news business they're in the war
do you know how often i criticize cnn
for you know propaganda
like basically every day
but not right now
i will i'm going to put a total
moratorium
on criticizing cnn or msnbc
about ukraine
so long as
their is in the right direction
because i think you're going to see cnn
pretty activated by whoever controls cnn
these days who knows
whether that's our intelligence agencies
or the democrats or whoever but they're
all on the same side on this
which is cnn wants russia
to not succeed in ukraine wouldn't you
agree
wouldn't it be fair to say that that
nobody as cnn
is
uh unbiased
about ukraine nobody nobody in fox news
that's maybe more obvious to you right
but fox news and cnn are on the same
side
which is on my side
and i think your side too
which is we don't want russia to succeed
in ukraine
so
this might be the only week in which at
least you know i may look at the other
coverage that they do on other topics
but if cnn tells you that
ukraine ukraine is winning
i'm just going to let that go
i'm going to let it go
you know just in your mind you might
want to play a little recording that
says you know under normal times he
would tell us that was
and i would
these are not normal times we're at war
and if uh cnn is making uh russia's
economy look shaky because of the way
they're
framing the news
good for you
we're on the same side on this
and if you don't think that public
opinion
is what will change the course of the
war i think you're wrong
how many people would disagree with that
so here's here's my
assertion
my assertion is
that as long as the ukrainians can hold
off the russian from a
quick victory
as long as that's a tie and it looks
like it might be you can't say that for
sure
but it looks like it might be a tie for
a while
as long as that's a tie
the economy is the war
would you agree with that part of the
reasoning as long as the military is
locked up however long that takes
the economy is where the real war is
and russia can't win the economic war
they can't in the long run
so if you're gonna predict where this
goes
it all depends on probably
ukraine holding for another few days
at which
point um i don't know how many days it
would take but but there is a point at
which
the russian oligarchs and the
you know the people behind putin are
going to accept
the the path out that we've given them
and when i say we
i mean probably the cia
[Laughter]
and me
and marco rubio
and anybody else who's saying in any
public way
something different about putin
wait a minute this isn't really about
russia is it
this is about putin
do you realize that that gives the
russian people
a way out
is that an accident
i don't think it's an accident
that the way out is for russia to say
whoa whoa this was never russia against
ukraine
this was always something about putin
he changed
you know we're going to accept your your
explanation that something about him
snapped
and we're going to get rid of them
ourselves because now we just have to
now here's the question
how hard would it be
for russia under any amount of pressure
to depose putin
like i assume he's got a pretty good
grip on things at this point
well
it probably depends how crazy he looks
to his own people don't you think
and they may be seeing a version of him
that looks even crazier than what we're
told
it's also possible he's perfectly sane
and that everything we're hearing is
fake
perfectly possible
and that's what you know
mike cernovich should be reminding you
once an hour today
all right
all right i saw a terrible comment on
locals but i'm not going to say it
so um social media is weaponized here's
another thing that
i think mike cernovich said in a tweet
and boy does it look like this
um it's something i've said before as
well that we're so we're so primed by
movies
and fiction
that we see real live events in three
um
three-part movies
you know movie with
reacts tell me that uh zielenski
with his famous uh we don't i don't need
transportation i need ammo
and then you know going in to lead his
people
tell me there's ever been a better third
act
like in a movie
because imagine if you will that things
go zelinski's way let's say he survives
very much in doubt at the moment but
let's say he does
and
russia falls
or at least you know putin can't hold
power because it's
he just went too far
this would be
a
a perfect movie
the three-act movie so zelinski is right
in the middle of the third act in which
it looks impossible
impossible
that he could win
but imagine the movie script where you
know they're in the bunker and you know
the russian army is
is closing in and communications are
falling and it's all falling apart
and then he starts getting good news
like a shipment of you know
anti-tank missiles just arrived and then
elon musk
puts up starlink i mean this is a
perfect movie script and i don't mean to
make light of it
what i'm pointing out
the same thing that cernovich pointed
out is that our brains are just primed
to see things as a three-act movie
and and we're seeing this as the third
act
and here's the here's why this matters
this isn't this isn't trivial
this is why this matters
if you see it as a three-act movie
your psychology will get into that
pattern
just automatically
and the three-act movie is telling us
that zelinski wins
that doesn't mean
it makes sense
that's what the movie's telling us
the the three-act movie has already been
activated in our mind to tell us that
zelinski wins and not only does he win
but he takes putin down because that's
the best movie
right now what happens when everybody
expects something to happen
not everybody but but let's say a
majority of people expect something
happen
they end up making it happen
it becomes self-fulfilling
because this goes to the morale of the
russian soldiers it goes to the morale
of the ukrainians it goes to the it goes
to does elon musk get involved it goes
to do the europeans get tough it goes to
do we ever let
russia blackmail europe again
it goes to all of that
um
the cleverest thing i saw again who
knows if this is true so this is another
report put your skeptic hat on but the
report was that uh the russian
conscripts you know 19 year old soldiers
or just confused and surrendering in
mass
now that's exactly the kind of story
that is unlikely to be true
it could be
but when you hear one side especially
the side that has the smaller military
force saying that the one with the big
military force are surrendering in mass
probably not
maybe not yet
but maybe in some cases now here's the
here's the good story
the good story is that the ukrainians
let the captured russian soldiers the 19
year olds
phone their mothers
just think about that
and then then that report was in the
news
they let they gave them phones
and told them to phone their mothers
now i don't know much about
russian
culture
so maybe somebody can help me out here
there are cultures in which
if the if the grandmothers and the
mothers get involved
that's just the way things are going to
go now i've been told
by
somebody in the
black american culture
that we always forget how powerful
the grandmothers are
you know the mothers and grandmothers
and that they're actually you know the
lever that moves everything if you let
them
and i wonder if this
if this approach of getting the mothers
in russia involved
might be kind of
brilliant imagine if every captured
soldier
is allowed to call home
because you know what the mother's
reaction was when they got a call from
their captured son
the mother's reaction was they didn't
know that they were there or why
they just found out
do you think word is going to get around
yeah
yeah now again this could be another
psyop and propaganda maybe there were no
russian soldiers that ever got captured
and allowed to call home but
why not
i mean i'm sure they're capturing some
i would let them all call home
wouldn't you
it seems pretty smart
psychologically
because i don't think the russian public
is up for killing people who look like
russians and talk like russians
i just
i feel like the russian army
has got the morale problem of all morale
problems
and we're probably
a day away from
ukraine successfully cutting their
supply lines
by wednesday
there's a good chance that the russian
supply lines are toast
and their economy
is in a death spiral
that's totally possible by wednesday
and again
24 hours ago everything looked
completely opposite
so what are the what is the likelihood
that i can predict what will happen on
wednesday
anybody
anybody
do you want do you want to maybe take me
down a peg because i deserve it
right
nobody can predict this
nobody if it sounded like i was
confident of what was going to happen on
wednesday in ukraine there should have
been a recording playing in your head
that says well he sounds confident but
nobody can predict this
nobody can predict this
no way to know
the only thing i think i'm going to be
right about
well let me let me ask you
it's too early to know so i'm not going
to claim being right
but i think i will be
and that claim is that the russian army
didn't they didn't estimate properly
how effective the the weapons would be
that the ukrainians had access to
so i think that part i'm going to be
right about
and i don't know anybody else who said
that that that they would be surprised
by the
you know the
the modern weaponry that was put against
them
the u.s intel community blew it again i
don't know did they
but will it matter in the end we don't
know
that's what
maybe we'll know on wednesday
did u.s intel cause this
depends
depends what you mean by causes
now here's a question
what percentage of all of russia's
complete military capability for the
entire country is employed in ukraine or
or let's say bogged down
have you seen that i've seen estimates
of how much
percentage of the arms he
put in the theater
two-thirds
now i think two-thirds is how much has
been deployed from
nearby
you know the stuff that was in that
theater
but it's not
it's
somebody's saying 25 that's what i'm
saying most so maybe 25 of his military
force
okay
well he's got a lot of military
i think it's closer to 50 don't you
do you think they put um here's what i
think
there's no way to know this and i i'm
just totally talking through my ass
right now but so i'm going to take this
purely from the perspective of somebody
who's got
experience in large organizations
okay so knowing knowing nothing about
the military
and not trusting any information coming
out of there i'm going to say something
that i think would be generally true
generally true
that the 80 20 rule
applies pretty much everywhere to
everything
right there are exceptions of course but
i don't think this is one and here's
where this applies
my bet
is that if you looked at all of the
military equipment that russia has
that 20 of it is really good stuff
and 80 of it maybe not so good
how many would agree with me so far
and that that wouldn't even be
necessarily
a statement about russia
it would be a statement about any large
organization
20
really good stuff 80 bad now
given the importance of this battle
do you think putin put
his just a general average
equipment in the field
or did he put his good stuff there like
as much as he could get there
what do you think
i'm seeing some people say average
do you think that he would do that
because he would save some good stuff
for in case china attacks on his other
border
he had literally no other use for the
good stuff
am i wrong
he's not defending any other place
he could put all of his good stuff in
ukraine
so
here's what i think and this is just
based on
knowledge of big organizations and how
they lie and how they do things
i think that if you think 20 of his
military might is dedicated to ukraine
that that's what it looks like on paper
but that it's probably closer to
70 of his capability
because it's all of his good stuff did
he send the bad general
or did he send his best general
did he send his bad special forces
or the best ones
right
is he using the dumbest missiles or is
he using all of his good ones
because i even saw somebody suggest he'd
run out of missiles
what
is that possible
can russia run out of missiles
i mean the good ones could they run out
of missiles by like in a week
some experts said that that didn't sound
possible to me but
maybe
i know
so
knowing that everything about everything
is a lie knowing what you know about
big organizations how many are willing
to side with me on the fact that if it
looks like russia put 25 percent of its
military there
it's probably closer to 75
or something in the neighborhood of
their abilities
i'm getting some yeses
right because that would be consistent
with everything you know about
everything
am i wrong
like
a less
i think it's true
unless everything we know about
everything is wrong
because everything you know about
everything suggests
they put their good stuff there
i don't know i would worry about the
fact that he's activated his nukes
or at least his nuclear force not the
nukes itself
so that ladies and gentlemen
is the best show you're going to see
today on the topic of ukraine
i don't think
there'll be any disagreement
if there's anything we can all agree on
this is the best content you've ever
seen and i'm just guessing
let's just say the competition is pretty
low
so
i think it was a tremendous job and as
always
yeah i say this not to patronize you
but the only reason i can do what i do
is because
the live viewers are doing what they're
doing like the the fact that this is
interactive is what makes it work
and that you're fact checking me in real
time that makes a big difference
scott would do well to watch wag the dog
you know i feel like that's
an npc
comment now
i'm going to add that to soylent green
and the matrix
like anybody who thinks that first of
all anybody who thinks that i'm not
familiar with that movie
what kind of weird assumption would that
be
because it's a popular reference i mean
even if you didn't watch the movie you
would know what it was about
so
all right um
so yes i'm aware of that
um tell ukrainians to negotiate peace
with russia
well
i don't know
i don't know what peace looks like or
what anybody would have to uh to agree
but that's all for today and i will talk
to you tomorrow thanks youtube for
joining me today
