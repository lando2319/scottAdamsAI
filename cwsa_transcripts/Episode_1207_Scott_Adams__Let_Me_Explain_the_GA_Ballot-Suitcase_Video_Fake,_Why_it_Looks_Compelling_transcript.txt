hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
time for coffee with scott adams the
best time of the day every single time
no exceptions
and to make it complete what do you need
well you need a copper marker glass
attacker gels or steiner canteen joker
flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i'm partial to coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything
better it's a simultaneous sip
go
well we are we are entering the
transition phase the transition phase
do i mean the administration
no i don't there might be a transition
there too
but i'm talking about the fake news
transition you may remember
that it was not that long ago i told you
that for four years
i think it is unambiguously true that
the vast majority of fake news
came from the left does anybody disagree
with that statement
that the vast amount of fake news
came from the left for the past four
years
maybe 80 20. it's not like it's not like
there isn't
you know mistakes and fake news and
misinterpretations and
bias on both sides but it was
it seemed to me deeply weighted
against the republicans and against
trump
now is that just because of trump
i would say no it's because
the the uh the group that's in power
has the advantage of actually doing
things
for example uh joe biden can
appoint people to uh
to the uh to the government right
put him in the uh what do you call it
the cabinet
and that's news and then the the news
that's friendly to joe biden
they've got a good content they could
say oh look at the good pics
this joe biden's making let's do a
segment
about how wise and brilliant his picks
are
now you could agree or disagree whether
they're wise or brilliant
but it's not really fake news right
they're not just
making something up because they've got
something real to talk about
they don't need to make anything up joe
biden did his job today
there it is there's our story but
if you're on the side whose president is
not in power
what do you have you're not going to run
the same stories
about all the good things he did and
he's doing his job today and he
cut a ribbon it's kind of boring for
your audience
so the side that's out of power ends up
whether
intentionally or just goes that way
making up most of the fake news
you were you should be experiencing
if this pattern follows and i'm pretty
sure it will
you should be watching a reversal
of the proportion of fake news so you're
going to go from 80
of it being coming from the left you
know like the president drinks bleach
and he's
calling racist fine people i mean it's
all just made up stuff
but you're going to see that reverse now
same as with obama
during the obama years fox news was uh
was basically a dumpster fire of fake
news and cnn
probably had their share but not as much
not even close so beware
and just be informed that that ratio
is in is in the process of reversing if
biden takes office
which is by no means guaranteed
all right so let's talk about
some of that all right how many of you
saw the video
out of georgia the security video
this showed poll workers uh dismissing
some number of people who had been
working for the night
and some people left and then after
those people left
the remaining people took these suitcase
looking things out from underneath
tables where it appears they had been
hiding
and then they processed many thousands
of votes
from those hidden suitcases
hidden suitcases looks pretty sketchy
doesn't it
pretty sketchy after they let the
witnesses go home
and then the hidden suitcases come out
and then there's a gigantic
spike for biden
pretty suspicious except
almost certainly fake
sorry it's gonna it's gonna hurt for the
next few months
until you realize that most of your news
has turned fake
because when it first happens you're not
going to believe any of it you're going
to be you well
meaning that you're you're still going
to believe that you're hearing real news
but it just won't be for a while
so here's here are the questions that
people gave me
because i know you're thinking the same
thing by the way here's a
here's a persuasion technique
a good persuasion technique whether it's
sales or just presenting
is to tell people what they're thinking
the moment they're thinking it
because if you can hit that the thought
you know and call it out the moment
they're thinking it you kind of
you kind of come become connected and
you become more influential
so i'm going to do that with you by
anticipating your objections
to be saying you're fake number one
is the video manipulated does anybody
think it's
uh manipulated digitally
i don't think so i don't believe it's
manipulated digitally
so that's not the claim i don't believe
anybody's made that claim
so let's say that we all agree that the
video captures
exactly what happened that what you see
is exactly what was happening do we all
agree on that so far
so that there's nothing there's nothing
in the video
production that's different now
here here's the uh here are the
questions that people ask me
scott they let the witnesses go
there's testimony that the witnesses
were told
they were done for the night scott
they were done for the night and by the
way i was i was
making lots of jokes about this video
and i've
deleted them all because i was waiting
for the debunk
and i thought if i get up early i can
make a bunch of jokes about this
this suitcase suitcases in the video
and i thought i'd better hurry because i
know this thing's going to get debunked
pretty quickly
and it didn't take long it only took a
few hours now
you're going to say it's not debunked
but let me go through let me go through
the argument
so the first question is why would they
send those witnesses home
and tell them and tell them that
they were done for the night and here's
the answer
that never happened that that's the
whole answer
you think you think you heard that fact
just never happened so
here's what did happen allegedly
now compare the debunk to the
the story you thought was real when you
first saw it doesn't mean the debunk is
real right
can you allow that it's possible that
the debunk is fake
right we can't rule that out but let me
tell you what it is and then you just
compare it and see for yourself
so the debunk says that the only people
who were sent home
were the envelope cutters so one part of
the
job was some people would just open all
the envelopes
and put the ballots in these containers
and then that was their job they were
not witnesses
they were not ballot counters they were
simply
envelope cutters now what do you do with
the envelope cutters
when you've reached the end of all your
ballots
in other words everything that needs to
be cut is cut
and that's the only thing they're there
for because people are trained for
specific jobs
so what would you do when all the
envelope cutters
are done cutting and there's nothing
left to cut
would you say to them looks like we're
done for the night
you can go home and if you were an
envelope cutter
and somebody walked up to you and said
hey good job looks like we're done for
the night you can go home
how would you interpret that would you
interpret it that the
ballot counting was done for the night
or would you interpret it as
only you ballot cutters are done for the
night
do you see how easily you could have
somebody who is a witness
to say look they told me we were done
for the night
but how exactly did they word it did
they say
you're done for the night did they talk
to the three people who were cutting
envelopes and say it looks like we're
done for the night
as in we enveloped cutters how easily
could somebody quite honestly think that
they heard somebody say they were done
for the night
but simply misinterpreted it now we did
see a number of people leave and
the story is that they were envelope
cutters the story is also that there was
one state witness who remained
but there is no story that says anybody
was
denied witnessing so i don't believe
there is any
any claim that there was any republican
witness
who didn't have access to the room if
they wanted it
so uh is every election
witnessed by both a republican and a
democrat
in every in every part of the process i
think the answer is no
right i believe the rule is that you're
allowed to witness
being allowed to witness is quite
different from
uh the sworn by the way the sworn
affidavits
are what people heard and saw so
somebody's saying they're sworn
affidavits
uh a sworn affidavit is what they
honestly think happened
that's not exactly the same as what
happened
that's somebody's interpretation of what
happened and like i said
if somebody honestly thought the
supervisor told them the counting was
done but it was just a misinterpretation
you could easily imagine that they would
swear under oath
i was told the counting was done but it
was just a misinterpretation
now what about the fact that these
suitcases were kept under the table
until these people left why would you
put
number one why would you put ballots in
a suitcase
did you ask yourself that why would
there be these
roller bags that you take on an airplane
how would those be in a vote facility
because it because it seems like if
something's in a suitcase
wasn't that the way it got into the
building like illegitimately
because it's in a suitcase it's not in
some kind of
official container right except
they're not suitcases the the rolly bag
things you saw
are the official ballot containers
they have wheelies on them because
they're heavy
that's it so there was no suitcases
there were only
official containers that were exactly
the containers that you use
to hold ballots now somebody said
but scott why were they under the table
why were they under the tables why would
you hide them under the tables
until these other people are gone to
which i say
where the hell else would you put them
apparently you've never worked
in any kind of a situation
like this where you keep stuff until you
need it
is under the table that's where it goes
do you think that they put wheels on
those containers
because they're not very heavy no they
have wheels
because they're hard to lift they're
heavy
where do you put something that's heavy
do you pick it up and put it on top of a
table
no you put it under the table do you put
it in the
aisle where people are walking around
and they would have to walk around it
no you would put it as close to the
counting machines as you could
not on top of a table because they're
heavy
and not in the aisle you would put them
under a table
relatively near the counting machines
and when would you take them out
when would you take them out well if it
were me
and i were running this process i would
count up all the ones that
that you could process that were already
out of the envelopes
when i was done processing all the ones
that are already out of the envelopes
do you know what i'd do i'd walk over
and see if there's any more to
process and then i would see that the
envelope cutters had
really gotten ahead and they'd created a
whole bunch of ballots that are
now in these luggage things and
the numbers that had been released for
the envelopes was gigantic
because they'd done a good job cutting
and now they just took those and ran
them through the system
every part of what you saw in the video
is the normal system
every part of it now
can i determine that just because the
video shows
two movies i know which one is true
you can watch that video and if you know
that these
luggage things are there's the standard
things they use
if you know that the cutters are done
and had been dismissed
and if you knew that it's obvious that's
where you would store them until you
need them is under the table
that's exactly where you put them could
it be
that some of the people who were in
charge of counting
might have been unaware of how many of
the cutters had put under the table
would that surprise you in such a you
know
weakly organized system would you be
surprised
to learn that after the cutters had left
somebody says oh wait
there are way more ballots here than we
thought we didn't realize they were
storing them under the table
how unusual would that be not even a
little bit
that wouldn't even be a little bit
unusual that would be exactly how you'd
expect
a semi-organized thing to to go it's
like oh we got some ballots over here oh
i forgot there's some under the table
pretty normal stuff now
do you see a complete movie for both
versions yes you do
you the the the video 100
percent supports both versions of the
story
one is that they just cut some stuff and
left
there were a lot of things they cut
maybe they found some more at the end of
the night but they were just all in the
room
they were in official boxes and they
just counted them
now another thing somebody said is
but scott that big spike that happened
all at the same time how could such a
big spike happened
well the answer is that's when they
started counting the ones that this
group of people had taken out of the
the envelopes they just waited until
they were done it's a big batch
they just ran them all at the same time
but what about the fact
allegedly they were 98 for biden
how in the world could you have so many
ballots that are 98
for biden number one i don't know that
that's true
do you i've heard people say it
do you know that that's true so i would
say that is
not even close to a data that i would
say
yeah that sounds pretty credible could
be true
let's say it is true let's take the
assumption that
there really were uh 98 of those votes
really did go to biden
all in that little hour there what does
that tell you about the video
doesn't really tell you that that's why
the anything you saw in the video
it doesn't tell you that's why it's 98
biden
because you could have an entirely
separate fraud
which created a whole bunch of let's say
harvested ballots
could it be that the harvested ballads
came in toward the end
yes it could be a complete fraud but
not the one you see on video in other
words the fraud could have happened
to create the ballots that were then cut
they were then put in the boxes that
were then counted
but would allow the possibility that
everyone in that room
was just counting ballots and didn't do
anything wrong
right that is not that possibility is
not
ruled out by anything you saw in the
video that they were just doing their
job
you can't rule that out based on the
video now
could you be suspicious based on the
video
sure should you follow up
absolutely of course because we all want
to know more and we'd like to be certain
um and if 98 of those votes went to
biden would you suspect that was fraud
yes yes you would if it were true
but it doesn't mean that if that were
fraud
that you saw any of that fraud happening
on that video
it could be just that's why ballots are
forbidden
but all they were doing is counting them
maybe
let's see what else do people say
oh somebody else said well i could i
could believe it was legitimate if it
happened at 12
noon but this is happening late at night
suspicious right to which i say
everything was happening late at night
that all the all the voting places were
counting late at night
because that's the way it works so none
of that means anything
all right
so i'm going to look at your comments
here for a moment because i want to see
how mad you are
signing out yeah people do not like
experiencing confirmation bias
and then knowing it but let me
if you prefer to believe this for a
while and by the way
you could be right i'm not gonna i'm not
gonna
rule out the possibility that this uh
video shows something bad i'm just
telling you that
there's nobody here who wanted that to
be
real more than i did well maybe trump
did right
but when i saw that video i laughed out
loud
and i said to myself okay this is
probably going to get debunked
but damn it i hope this is real i like i
really really
wanted it to be real because you know i
do
i do believe the election was rigged and
i don't think it's
we will necessarily get such good
evidence like that
so the fact that it might have been real
was just sort of exciting to me
now you see where my bias is right my
bias is 100 i want that freaking thing
to be a real video
but i'm afraid it isn't i'm afraid the
evidence
just isn't there you really just had to
hear the other
the other side of it now somebody's
saying uh the
the fake water burst uh thing was fake
now let me be as clear as i can there's
a hundred percent chance
in my opinion that the election was
rigged
right and here's my argument
and try out my argument compared to this
argument
so the the the video evidence you saw
is no better or worse than the covington
kids
video is there anybody who would
disagree with the statement
the the credibility of that georgia
video
is equivalent to if you're just looking
at it you're not an expert and you're
just a
person looking at a video it's
equivalent to
in believability and credibility to the
first
covington kids video you saw which was
very believable
and completely reversed of what the
actual situation was
could this be one of those where it's
really looks believable like there's
some fraud happening right in front of
you
but it's just not yeah easily easily
that wouldn't even be on
that wouldn't even be a stretch it would
be the most normal thing in the world
that
that that's fake um so the ones that i
tend to doubt
in terms of claims are the ones that are
a little too on the nose
like there were there was a truck there
was a trailer full of ballots
but we can't find it and there was a
video of a thing but the
other explanation fits it too
right you're gonna see a lot of these so
here's my argument
for why the election was stolen
it goes like this you it's 110 degrees
out in your town
it's the summer and you buy an ice cream
cone
and you're walking down the sidewalk
eating your ice cream cone and
the top of the co the ice cream falls
off on the sidewalk
it's 110 degrees and the sidewalk is
just sizzling hot
now you know you're not going to pick it
up and you say to yourself
ah screw it bad luck today
and you walk away now i ask you an hour
let's say a few hours later i say to you
you know
you you dropped your ice cream on that
hot sidewalk at 110 degree day
do you know if it melted
do you know if it melted and you say to
yourself you know
i guess i don't i don't know if that
melted
it was 110 degrees and it was ice cream
i know because i was
i was licking it before it fell off so
it was real ice cream
but i don't know it melted or do i
what would you say would you say that
hours later
you'd know it melted or would you say i
don't know there's no evidence
i can't prove it i don't have a video i
don't have a testimony
nobody watched it could you fairly say
it did not
melt because you don't have any evidence
no no
you know it melted why do you know it
melted
without any evidence you know it melted
because it didn't have any other option
there was only the one thing it could do
in this world
it had to melt it doesn't matter if it
had a witness
it doesn't matter if it was on video it
had to melt
so this election
is like that ice cream that fell on the
sidewalk
the one thing we did learn is that at
the very minimum
there are tons of ways that you could
cheat
did we not learn that for sure i feel
pretty confident about that
that whether or not cheating is
confirmed at some large scale or not
we certainly learned that the witnesses
don't see the whole system
at the very least it's a non-transparent
system you all agree non-transparent we
can't audit the software
the witnesses had certain access but not
complete there are all kinds of
chain of custody things that nobody
witnesses etc
now under a condition where cheating is
completely practical
if you wanted to do it and these stakes
are sky high
it's like trying to deny orange hitler
second term
what could be a higher stake than that
so it's possible
you've got the biggest stakes in the
world how often
does major fraud happen when it's
possible
in fact quite possible and
people really really want to do it how
often
every time it's like the ice cream
melting on the sidewalk
you don't need a witness if you have
this setup
if you've got a hot sidewalk and some
ice cream you're going to have some
melted ice cream
if you have a non-observed election
in the united states the highest
stakes you could possibly imagine
yes it of course it happened
of course now how about the question of
did our foreign adversaries try to
influence the election
we have some information on that now
given that we know foreign adversaries
can all right so it's possible right
same situation
it's possible we know that for sure
because how hard it is it to
you know do something with social media
it's easy so it's possible
and of course if you're china or russia
the iran for example
the stakes are they're not just high
it's life and death it's just it's it's
the fate of your country
it's the highest stakes you could
possibly imagine so it's
possible indeed it's easy
and the highest stakes in the world did
it happen
yes yes
we don't have to debate it you don't
have to show me the evidence
i don't need to see a video of somebody
in china
type anatomy i don't need that evidence
it had to happen it can't not happen
in our world it's ice cream on a hot
sidewalk
of course china tried to influence the
operation
in fact dni uh said
ratzenberger or ratcliffe i'm sorry dni
ratcliffe
um told cbs that china is using
blackmail bribery and covert influence
to target members of congress
and make sure the only laws that are
favorable to china are passed
that's just part of what they're doing
apparently they're
they china and this is from gordon chang
actually
china was using ai
to figure out who was
uh let's say sympathetic to antifa
and black lives matter and then they
would send them tick tock videos of how
to riot
do you think that mattered china sending
uh black black lives matter and antifa
sympathizers directions on how to riot
you don't think that mattered probably
mattered
and gordon chang says that's exactly
what happened
so everybody looking for these you know
little bits of evidence of whether this
election was stolen or not it's
complete misdirection you don't need
evidence
if bullies chase down the witnesses let
me say that again
bullies chased out witnesses in the key
cities
right so keep that fact about all the
the election
fraud and mischief and stuff so keep
that that fact just as one little fact
that bullies and we have plenty of
witnesses it seems like that will be
easy to demonstrate
bullies chased down witnesses to the
vote counting
okay that's an important fact now look
now take
all of the other stuff you got your
video
that you you think shows some co
corruption
you've got your data analysis that shows
some worrying things
you got hundreds of witnesses now add up
all those
strong arguments and then just
throw them in the ocean because you
don't need them
they're useless maybe you could prove
them in chord maybe you couldn't doesn't
matter they're useless
the only thing you needed was
bullies made witnesses leave
that's the end of the conversation every
 thing you say after that
doesn't matter you get that right
nothing matters but that it's the only
thing that matters
and if you allow yourself to imagine the
other stuff matters
you you were victim of misinformation
and misdirection all that matters
is it was non-transparent by force
because bullying is force
this was a violent coup
or you must assume it was a violent coup
because the witnesses were
intimidated way by force
so the the assumption is it's a stolen
election because of the bullying of the
witnesses you don't need anything else
nothing else to throw out this election
and do whatever you want if you're if
you're the house
now i don't know if they will i would
predict that biden will actually take
the
the job to you know keep society
together
but i think we can say that nothing like
the republic exists anymore
you know i think it was uh was it
franklin who
said when asked what kind of form of
government
they had created he said a republic if
you can keep it
and we didn't we lost it
because the republic doesn't look like
anything like
bullying witnesses and having a
non-transparent
election with software you can't audit
that's not even close to being a
republic whatever that is
is a bulliocracy do we have a form of
government that's based on who can bully
the best
in the election process because that's
what happened
so we did lose the republic it's no
longer
theoretical you know the country still
functions
so that's good you know luckily we have
such good systems
that are built up over time the economy
still chugs along and
you know you know the garbage still gets
picked up but we're definitely
not a republic anymore can we get it
back
do you want to get it back i think we
can get it back
i don't know if it'll be in the next
four years i mean
we might have to wait for another
election to get it back but yeah we
could get it back
if we get to 2024 and there is more
witness
intimidation at polling places
what would be the proper response
you know what it is i don't even have to
say it i'm not going to say it out loud
because i'll get banned from all social
media platforms
but yeah this doesn't happen the second
time
you get that right this is once
maybe they got away with it maybe they
stole the election it looks like it
maybe they'll get away with it have four
years of biden
but this doesn't happen twice
doesn't happen twice all right
uh the the weirdest funniest story of
the day is that joe biden was asked in
an interview
about his disagreements with kamel
harris i guess jake tapper was talking
to him
and biden actually told this joke
in public he said like i told barack
if i reach something where there's a
fundamental disagreement
meaning with kamala we have we have
based on moral principle
i'll develop some disease and say i have
to resign
there's your strong leadership he says
if
his vice president disagrees with him
he'll he'll claim he has a disease and
resign
now to be fair he's joking
to be fair it was actually a pretty good
joke
right yeah as a professional humorist
i give him a good grade on that joke
that was a solid joke
because everybody was thinking it it was
uh
he hit the two the two joke dimensions
of
you're already thinking it so that's one
dimension he's got something that
you know was in your mind to begin with
and
then he did something bizarre the
bizarre thing is that he said it out
loud in public
which you weren't expecting that's what
makes it a joke
so it was already in your mind and that
he said it out loud that's two of the
six dimensions of humor
that i talk about if you want more on
the dimensions of humor just
google my name and six dimensions of
humor
it'll pop up all over the internet all
right
so i don't know
that this is necessarily signaling some
kind of a
freudian slip where he's signaling to
the world that this is going to happen
uh i think it's probably more it was
just a joke
but i don't think it's like they haven't
thought of it
you know it's not like it's not on the
option set which is funny because he
jokes about it and it is funny
but it's sort of on the option set it's
legitimately
one of the options i don't know how
likely it is but
it's on the list yeah it might be fifth
or sixth but it's on the list
um so there's a question of whether i
guess biden said he does want
trump to attend his inauguration do you
think trump
should attend biden's inauguration
now there's a history of it because it
um
it signals a peaceful transfer of power
and it's good for the country
but do you think in this special case
that trump
should go to biden's inauguration
i would say uh strong now on that
strong now as a supporter i would be
quite disappointed actually if he went
and here's the reason if he doesn't take
back
the fine people hoax you can
you can't be okay with that you know it
would be one thing if they
lied about each other's wreckers you
know standard political things
but the fine people hoax you can't
you can't be okay with that you can
never be okay with that
in my opinion so i would like to see the
president say you know
as long as you're still spreading that
fine people hoax you can
you can go it alone uh he won't do that
but it'd be fun
so um i had this
this weird experience of you know i i
turn
on hannity and i'm watching this video
of
the georgia video that looks like but i
don't think is
uh massive voter fraud and then i turned
it over to cnn
and anderson cooper is introducing a
clip of the president
and anderson has this exasperated
disgusting look that he brings to
everything
if it's trump related so he tries to get
this look
like i'm not just telling you what's
happening
and i'm not just telling you my opinion
look at how i feel about this
so he so he's so he's i'll try to do my
best anderson
is really really disgusted look and i
think it goes like this
and the president
this next clip we're going to see
he's just turned into some flimflam man
he actually used that term
flimflam and he said everything you're
going to see in this clip
is false and i thought to myself this is
going to be good
because whatever clip follows that is
going to be some super right
and i'm thinking you know trump
unleashed
you know if he thinks if he comes to
think he's a lame duck
the things he might say in office are
going to be really entertaining
so i'm like oh okay i got to see this if
anderson cooper says there's not a
single
true statement in this entire clip this
is going to be some good stuff
and i turned on the clip and everything
the president
said was true
and i thought what the hell it is such a
mind
to to see these two worlds side by side
now as i say uh
you know maybe maybe we're all wrong
about what's true but i think anderson
might be the most uh the most departed
from reality
in terms of uh his vision of president
trump
apparently governor kemp in georgia is
asking the
secretary of state to do a signature
audit of the votes
i did see a tweet that there were a
whole bunch of categories of georgia
votes that they thought were
dead people and people too young people
moved away and they were pretty big
numbers
and but it but that tweet sort of
disappeared
i feel as if that needs a little more
credibility to
to talk about that is it true that uh we
have
information of a whole bunch of
fraudulent votes
in georgia i saw a tweet on it is that
real
or is that just somebody alleging it and
then was that
from uh was matt brainard the the source
of that data so i i think that some of
that requires
verification so in other words if you're
if you think that a number of these are
dead people you really really need to
check to make sure it's not people with
the same names etc now of course they
they tried to check for that i know matt
brainard
would not put out any data that had an
obvious problem with it
all right so so understand this
if matt brainard put it out it wouldn't
be
any obvious problems with it but it
would still require a verification
it could be if you dig down you find out
something you didn't know
but there won't be anything that's like
intentionally
fraudulent or obviously wrong if it's
coming from
matt brainard but does require
verification
so we'll see if that produces anything
what do you think of the section 230
issue the issue of whether social media
should be
publishers now president trump has said
he won't sign
some defense authorization act unless uh
section 230 gets removed from social
media
and that would make them suitable
so if they if they lost their protection
under
section 230 as i understand it they
would be treated as regular publishers
who can
edit things and not edit things and if
you can edit what content
is on your platform that makes you the
author
in a way it makes you responsible for
the content
because you had a hand in deciding
whether it was there or not
versus the phone company that you make a
phone call and you can say whatever you
want it's not up to the phone company
and they're not
they're not banning anything they're
being a voice call
so a lot of people say
uh let's get rid of that section 230 and
then the
social media companies could be sued
for i don't know throttle you or doing
whatever they do
um what do you think would be the
downside of that
what what is your uh what do you believe
would happen if section 230 would move
let me ask you specifically do you think
that twitter would survive
if this protection were removed
would twitter survive what do you think
i don't know the answer to that question
by the way
i want to see what you think because it
seems to me they would get
sued if they keep things the way they
are
so what would they have to do if if
section 230 were removed
what would twitter have to do
they would have to remove anybody who
was a risk
so they would have to remove anybody who
would say something that could put them
at risk
which would include everybody you'd like
to follow on twitter
twitter would have to get rid of
everybody
who's interesting because it's the
interesting people
who say things that sometimes are not
true
because they're willing to take a little
more risk that's what makes them
interesting
right yeah you saw me be wrong already
you know at least once this morning
because i'm one of those people who
takes a risk
you know i'll i'll take things a little
farther than maybe maybe
i should and it's part of the fun as
long as i tell you that's what i'm doing
i think that's
that's fair because i tell you i'm doing
it
and somebody says who cares yeah so
removing section 230 would remove social
media
from the world is that why you want
now i haven't heard the other argument
now some of you are thinking
okay i knew i'd say the comment here
somebody somebody said
that's okay i'll go to parlor parlor
dies the same day
you know that right parlor would be out
of business
same day there's no such thing as
twitter going out of business because of
section 230
and then parlor not going out of
business
it's the same business they don't have a
ch what whatever happens to one is going
to happen to the other
so if you want them all to go into
business that would be the way to do it
um but is there any middle ground
is there a middle ground where there's
more transparency
and maybe some appeals process let me
ask you this
if you had the option of transparency in
algorithms and you actually felt
confident that it really was transparent
i don't know
how you do that but let's say you could
get there and you can manage your own
algorithm and you could just turn it off
let's say you could just turn it off and
you just see things in the order that
they come in
it's everybody that you follow and
that's it
just there's no algorithm at all it just
shows you everything and you can just
click a switch and get that would you be
happy with that
because there would be no filtering you
would just push a button and you
you personally would never be filtered
how about
or at least in terms of the content you
get to see how about if they added an
appeals process so that some independent
non-twitter people who may be selected
you know on some kind of a
temporary term and rotating and they
look at it and they say all right we
don't we don't work for twitter
we just work for the world we're just
volunteering
and in our opinion you know this person
was suspended for a while but we think a
year is long enough
and so we say a year's long enough we'll
put you back on giving another
chance what if you had that
would you be happy with transparent
algorithms
plus an appeals process that was not
from twitter they just
use an independent board and take the
advice would you work could you work
with that
digital bill of rights yes i think there
should be a digital bill of rights
uh for exactly this sort of thing so i'm
looking at your answers i see
lots of no's lots of no's
but what would you do instead
would you would you get rid of it
because remember it's not just twitter
facebook goes twitter goes and
instagram goes do we just get rid of our
our
most important industries in the united
states because the digital businesses
are
the important ones at this point right
somebody says 230 reform as opposed to
removal
yeah i think what i'm talking about is
reform there's
that's probably a good way to say it um
somebody says no censorship well
but what i said was you could have an
option as a user
to push a button and you could have
censorship
or not have it it was just your choice
as a consumer
how's that is that a problem why would
you object to that because the only
people who would be
censored would be for the audience to
say yeah i want you to censor the bad
stuff i don't want to even see it
i might even pick that myself you know
if i had that option of uncensored
versus censored don't assume that i
would pick uncensored
don't assume that i mean i might click
back and forth once in a while to make
sure i'm not missing anything
but i feel like censored has some value
it just goes too far and my sense of
more than i want i'd want to see both
town square free speech yeah
you know i i feel and i made the same
argument
a million years ago when tipper goer al
gore's wife
was railing to add um
she wanted to add warning labels to
music
and any of you who are old enough to
remember this remember there was a big
kerfuffle and people said hey
free speech free speech stop putting
warning labels of profanity on my
my product and i said now of course i
like as much freedom as possible
but i said that's not decreasing your
freedom
that's actually increasing it meaning
that
the consumer has more freedom
because they have more information the
more information you have that you can
act on
gives you in effect more freedom so by
putting a warning label on some types of
content
the consumer knows more
i would say that expands their freedom
because the more you know the more you
can make
smart free choices a dumb free
free choice meaning that you had freedom
but you didn't know anything so you made
a bad choice
well i guess that's freedom but it's not
a good kind
i'd rather i'd rather have the good kind
of freedom where i have all the
information and that's just up to me
so i argued that labeling things
is just always useful it's just a
service that has nothing to do with
decreasing your freedom
230 is not the problem it's letting
twitter use it as a shield
while breaking its rules okay so there's
an argument which is
that the problem is not the legislation
it's keeping twitter to it
you know i i have a
philosophy that i know a lot of you
don't share which is that
mistakes that get corrected are not the
same as mistakes
just plain mistakes because we live in a
messy world
if you start blaming everybody who makes
a temporary mistake
that then they immediately apologize for
and correct
i just can't get mad at people for that
like even if it's bad for me you know
i'm still gonna say yeah it would have
been better if it was perfect from the
start
but anybody who fixes something that's
wrong and does it legitimately
is a hero in my mind because it doesn't
there aren't enough of those
so in twitter's case if if i may
defend them a bit i would say that
you've heard jack say when challenged
about specific things that got suspended
you've heard jack say that was a mistake
we reversed it
now you certainly need a system for
which
alleged mistakes get a hearing that may
be the part of the system
that's missing but if you have a company
that's willing to say
you know put the head of the company on
and the public and say
in direct words you know no no weaseling
no no excuse there was no excuse offered
that was a mistake we fixed it
i don't have a problem with that as long
as there's a system for
you know the the alleged mistakes um
do we need 230 yeah i don't know
if you give me options as a consumer i
don't care about any of that
i'll just pick the one i like and i'll
be happy because i'll feel like i picked
it
right now part of the problem is that as
a consumer you don't feel like you got
the choice
you know you could be yeah i
i forgot my ring next to my drum kit if
you're
you guys are so uh observant you notice
my ring isn't on
i have to take my ring off to practice
my drums because it hits the ring hits
the
the stick
all right you debunked the wrong video
somebody says
i debunked the wrong video
well i debunked the video i saw and the
one that's going around
is there's somebody says there's two
videos
james dixon says well why don't you
tweet me the other video
uh just for fun um
i believe that that's not true james uh
i see your comment but tweet it at me
i believe there are not two videos
oh there's another video with a blonde
and a thumb drive i did see that one
is that the one you talk about i saw the
one with the blonde
and you know she surreptitiously ate
something in her hand
i give that zero credibility
zero because you can't really tell
what's going on in the video
you could imagine it's something bad and
you can imagine it's not
i don't think there's anything else you
can say from that
um somebody says there's a georgia state
vid all right well just send it to me
and i'll talk about that but the one i
saw
is the one i talked to
that's all i got for now and i will talk
to you
later
all right youtube uh uh what song am i
practicing
on the drums i i'm watching a drummer
called
cinna or cinna i don't know how to
pronounce it s-i-n-a
it's a young woman who's a drummer and
she does
she does a lot of the oldies like the
beatles etc so i've been trying to copy
ringo starr
which is tough because he's left-handed
um talent stacking the guitar
yeah oh is it pronounced cena
somebody says that her name is
pronounced cena
yeah and by the way speaking of talent
stacks
let me talk about this so so it's a
young woman who plays drums on youtube
and she's got over a million followers
and
she's been doing it for years since i
think she was a teenager she must be in
her
20s now and watching her
compile her talent stack is really fun
because you can watch the videos over
time and see when she's young all the
way to current
and she started down just being you know
teenager who was pretty good on drums
and
so she did some youtube videos and then
she started adding to her talent stack
so then she was good at presenting and
you know she she got her lighting and
her video
and then she had pop-up windows so you
could see her feet working while she was
drumming
and she really put together quite a
talent stack there i would guess she
makes
one to two million dollars a year and
if you told me what is your one talent
you know what's the one thing
that makes her worth millions of dollars
a year let's say at least a million
dollars a year
i would say well she's really good at
drums
but i'll bet you you could find i don't
know
maybe 20 000 people who could play drums
really well
and what makes her different because she
added those other
those other talents plus she's a woman
so he makes a little more interesting
because there are fewer
female drummers
fulton county certified the election you
said
okay
somebody says unsubscribe this guy is
lying we will not accept a fraudulent
election
um
so somebody says there's an arena video
and a state
video i don't if it's a video of the
same room at the same time
i don't know that that would be
different
so it was the georgia state video that
was debunked and not the
arena security video are you talking
about the same room
because it was the same room it doesn't
matter it's the same video
know the cubicle video oh there's
another video
of somebody going to a cubicle but
there's not enough information on that
to
to have an opinion yet
yeah so if there's one thing that you
should learn in 2020
it's this the one thing you should learn
in 2020 is you can't trust video
but for the uh the troll who said that
you should unsubscribe
from this channel apparently you missed
the whole first part
because i'm the guy who says you don't
even need evidence
i'm the guy who says you can guarantee
that the election was stolen
because the the setup because it was
easy and they had a high motive to do it
so of course it was stolen
there's no other way it can go so to the
troll who
is completely mis interpreting me 100
just because i don't buy every piece of
evidence
doesn't mean it isn't guaranteed that
the election was stolen
of course it was stolen
can i prove it probably nobody can my
guess is that it will not be proven
it's just uh it had to happen
epoch time has a video of suitcases
uh they do okay
somebody says scott is uh conceding no
scott is predicting
scott is predicting it's different
i'm not i'm not actually running for
president so i don't get to concede or
not to concede
but i can predict
and by the way don't mistake
strategy for surrender you do know
that if things go the way the pundits
seem to think it will go and biden takes
office
you do know it will largely destroy the
democrat party right
if you want that that i don't see it
could go any other way really
i know there's some people saying oh
they'll control everything by
changing the laws and stuff as long as
the republicans hold the senate
which is still a chance i think i think
that election will be rigged as well but
if the if the republicans hold the
senate
you just have to wait two years and
congress will turn republican and
two more years and republicans will own
everything
if that's what you want so don't think
it's
uh don't think in terms of retreat or
giving up
thinking about short-term or long-term
those would be the
that's the frame you should look all
right that's enough for now talk to you
tomorrow
