hey
YouTube Happy Thanksgiving
everybody good to see you on the X we're
live on The Cutting Board uh
level but over here we've got a little
bit more of a human
view this will be my first
ever just hanging out with you video now
the way this is going to work
is that you get to hang out and talk
with other people or do whatever you
want I'll see the comments on the locals
people probably first and the rest of
you uh feel free to hang out it might be
entertaining but probably not probably
just hanging out you can chat with your
your friends and uh you will feel less
lonely so the idea behind this is to uh
essentially just make everybody feel
little less
lonely so we're going to start with
soup and this is a uh I'm going to call
it my Thanksgiving soup we've got some
soup stock and some vegetable
broth I didn't really know what the
difference was so I just got them
both I think one's thicker or something
something like
that now it won't take you long to
figure out I'm not what you'd call a
skilled Chef or anything like
that or anything in that General
neighborhood no
nothing I'm just going to squirt this
crap in here and mix two of these
broths we don't know what's going to
happen is everybody uh how how many of
you are actually
alone except for of course our wonderful
company how many of you are actually
alone
got some me
yay got some yeses I am wow a lot of you
okay well this was exactly what you
needed we're going to soothe your
souls now
let's get this bad boy steaming a little
bit we're not going to talk about
politics really nothing
bad so let's see the
ingredients are as
follows you got your big ass carrot
which is going to get chopped up while
you watch the uh people on the xtram
will get to see me lose a finger up
close no that's not true I have very
good cutting technique I was a vegetable
cutter professionally I've told the
locals people this before but if you use
good cutting technique you don't have to
worry which is putting your knuckles
like that so you couldn't hurt yourself
if you wanted to it's all Techni
but staying away from the knce knife is
even
easier
so oh my God I hate cutting round things
because they roll
off now the magic of this of course is
that you got your vegetables of
different
densities so you got to get the the
thick ones going
first and you want to make sure that
you've calculated in your brain
the approximate the thickness of all
these bad
boys everything works
out these un Edibles
no no I'm
not you'd be amazed to
know I'm on
natural all right so we've got some of
that going in
there uh now I've been told that corn
starch is a good thing to put in
soup I don't know if I should wait till
it boils just SL slop some in there
thicking it up a little
bit no corn starch too too
late it's corn
starched yeah let's
see
I might not be looking at all your
suggestions bay leaf you
say bay leaf
interesting interesting bay leaf
H I might have some bay
leaf come with me
X we's see what I got
here checking out the
spices bay leaf Rosemary I don't think I
have bay leaf any I see any bay leaf in
there
no bay leaf
failure but will that stop us no hold on
hold
on hold on
X come back to me there you
go all right here's a here's a uh
cooking tip for you best cooking
tip there always put your garbage next
to you just little professional
tip all right let's see what else we
need we need probably need a another
carrot or two cuz I like me some
carrots these are
good maybe one more of
these anybody glad you're here
yet yeah I I just wonder if anybody's
having any fun I mean it's better than
sitting there lonely on H Thanksgiving
right
yeah this is giving you that that live
feeling like you're in the kitchen do
you know what's the best feeling
somebody owns cooking am I right the
best the best ASMR
sounds somebody else cooking oh my God I
could listen to it all day because I
think it's when you're a kid you're
hearing you know Mom or Dad are making
you some food and you know something
good is coming and it's going to be good
pretty much every
time well maybe not every
time now
quiz go name it name it name it name it
go what is it
but fruit that was a good
guess name
it name it uh the answer is it's a Keith
alman's cold dead heart Keith alman's
cold dead
heart some people call it rudaba
rudaba or as the the clerk at the
grocery store called it
today this uh What uh what what's
this what what is
this
so that's what it is we go for the big
ass knife another tip if you got a big
hard thing okay no jokes all right I'll
take a moment so you can enjoy that
unintentional punchline or unintentional
straight line all right got that on your
system so uh I'm going to go small so to
speak I'm going to carve off it'ss out
and tough
skin CU who likes and tough skin
nobody and notice my good technique of
always using the knife away from my hand
never T
it especially when you have extra hard
objects you really don't want want to go
toward your hand
ever and also with soft objects same
thing all
right this is probably hard for some
people to
watch smells really good
actually anybody get any uh any fights
with the relatives today actually a lot
of you didn't have any
relatives you haven't missed
anything use a peeler on a Raba
Raba this sounds like hard work that
would take a long
time now the the an sides um I collect
up and I keep it in
tupperware so later I can make a a soup
stock out of the uh the remains
does anybody believe
that no I do not do
that but for a while you believed that
didn't you for for a little while did
you believe that I use this to make no
not a single person believed that okay
you know me too well apparently you know
me way too
well yes no I don't do
that now we got the big ass
knife and we want to have big chunks big
chunks and the rud bagot is a secret
ingredient in all of
this it's the one that when you get it
on your spoon you go
UDA just like that you
say all right we will solve for this
cubes is
good
[Music]
cubes or actually you could even see
it whistle while you
cut move the bottle
move the bottle is that
better how how amazing is this that this
is even
possible isn't it kind of amazing that
this is even
possible so what I've got going here
here I'll show the folks on
X so locals and YouTube meet
x x would like to see you so this is the
little setup that I have in my upstairs
office I just brought it down and then I
brought this one so I can see the
comments a little bit
closer that's what's going
on now I think I warned you that the
first hour is
familyfriendly so we're in the family
friendly familyfriendly first
hour there will be no nudity now or
later you'll be happy to
hear now the next question you have is
Scott are you putting potatoes in this
well
probably think I
will I think I'll put some red
potatoes whoever promised you nudity was
lying or
lying potatoes we're going to be
quartering the
potatoes
whoos
do
whoos
do I won't say it again it's already
annoying all
right yes I did wash my vegetables
before I began yes I am keeping these
skins on the red
potatoes
because only monsters and heathens take
the skins
off that's right don't be a
monster would you like to know the
finest food that I ever had as a
child this is no
joke my literal favorite food is a raw
potato with salt have you ever had
it have you ever tried a raw potato with
salt it's awesome oh I'm sorry
it's family time it's
awesome oh it's really
good the the salt just brings it alive
well I think we need a little bit
more potato just a little
bit oh my God I could serve that as an
appetizer but then people would say
Scott it doesn't look like you put much
effort into your appetizers and I'd be
like that's
true all right that's enough
potato uh
question should I take a leak in my
soup all right now these are onions
should I put these green onions in My
Soup getting a
yes yes all right I think it's just
because you want to see me cut it you
said to yourself oh he's good with
carrots and potatoes you did okay with
the rudaba but does he know hand how to
handle a whole bunch
of green onions at the same
time sort of I used to back when I was a
salad
cutter I was one eff fishing salad
cutter I'm not a big lover of the uh the
green
part kind of like I don't go too far
up a little bit that's
enough all right is anybody hungry yet
you've already already
eaten Stir It Scott I wish I knew where
my stirring things
went
aha found a stir
thing all
right you're
hungry oh I don't know if that's the
best
part is it the best
part I don't
know all right
now what's in here oh
broccoli we don't need to do the
broccoli yet that will be a late
addition but we'll prep
it the proper broccoli knife is this
one because because you need to get in
there got to get in there got to get in
there cut their little heads
off you call them Flor
R all
right
now some might cut them some might pull
them
apart I feel like the less a knife
touches your food the
better I wash my hands sometimes so yeah
the less your knife touches them the
better that's my feeling we'll get rid
of that and then we'll put this aside
put it
aside see over
here
then then we'll transfer these over
there whoa hello green
beans protein it is
all right no I'm not putting cucumbers
in the soup that's the question you're
probably wondering no those are for the
appetizer which I'll show you
also all right beans beans
beans that was a joke just for the
people on x
little clowning around you know cuz
can't take the holidays too
seriously all
right gathered together
beans you're about to
be oh there used to be a
bean but now it's a has
Bean ladies if you don't like that
joke ask your hasbean you might like
it that jokes all day long all day long
all day long bad
jokes don't try to slow my
rooll no nothing can stop me from Dad
joking and I believe you all know the
rule what's the rule Thanksgiving is a
dad joke free zone uh it's an asylum
Asylum date you can do maximum dad jokes
all day long until midnight at midnight
Black Friday kicks in and dad you're
worthless it's all about the shopping
after that all right you're dead at
midnight you're dead to the world that's
shopping
time all
right I hope none of you are crying over
spill
milk yes it was a while ago that I threw
away the best part it was sort of a
while ago yeah we're not much worrying
about it
anymore but if if you'd like to come to
my house and rumage around I got the
ends of those green
onions might make a lovely soup stock or
not we're
not all right
now I've got a big
question on or no onion I'll give you
two two
choices red onion white
onion I say onion Yes red or
white I see both oh interest oh
interesting interesting both all right
interesting
oh I'm seeing more Reds on YouTube this
is interesting more more uh colonizers
on
local interesting there's a difference
actually then more people want white
ones on locals and more people want red
ones is that because there are more
people of color on YouTube watching and
you're like hey we don't need
your
generic Caucasian onion we want onion
with a little flavor little flavor well
I have just the answer for both of
you it's
called The Melting Pot have you heard of
it have you heard of it yeah it's the
thing I'm going to put both of these
onions in there yeah
both and watch oh God they're fighting
they're fighting stop it break it up you
two stop it all
right the reason you put them in the
Melting Pot is they have to be dead get
along you got to melt them
first that's not true they're actually
very good
friends all right well we need the
correct knife
no
yes now I'm going to be honest I do not
do n onions
normally and it has been quite a while
since I bothered to even prep an onion
don't even remember how to do
it but I think I'll take off the rough
ounter
shell that's what we culinary experts
call it the shell some of
you I'm not crying you're
crying sometimes I get so
sentimental
Thanksgiving that when I got a y I Cry
oh going to lose it here in a minute I
calculate I have 20 seconds left before
all hell breaks loose in my eye socket
area hold on Scot stay alive stay
alive quick I need an engineering I need
an engineering chemistry
expert true or false that after you get
all this stuff in your hands the onions
on your hands that if you touch
stainless steel it will neutralize the
smell is that a real
thing a lot of NOS so that that's no
some people say true but mostly say
no run under cold
water okay that would be one way to
go that soup is sup
tastic we'll turn it down to a slow
boil just wash your
hands well maybe I will well how much of
an onion do you think goes in this soup
I say
half
whoa let's do a
half that's very
ugy there very
oniony
but waste not our
onion oh yeah it's only being directly
over it they get
you all right onion
two
boom boom boom boom best soup
ever
where are my cooking
assistants my God man like I need
help no I'm not sating
them
okay
mushrooms what did you actually say
Mushrooms right before I picked up the
mushrooms and said
mushrooms what one of you guessed
exactly like as I picked it up well the
mushrooms and the
broccoli being in the softer Foods
categories will be prepped but not put
into the soup until a slightly later
time
fortunately we have plenty to do before
that I'll just get that
ready all right for our next
trick I'll make my favorite
appetizer it requires white
vinegar and a cucumber or
multiple
and goes like this let me get the starch
off my
hands first
you peel your
Cuke some of you might be slow peelers I
cannot Abide a slow
peeler you got to be a fast peeler
do it do it do it do it do it do it do
it some say I've been practicing all my
life for
this stop
it they will be further cut after I've
tamed the rest of
[Music]
them I don't know if I'll do all of them
there might be a limit to how much you
want to watch
this but hey that didn't stop me
yet it's important to have a good peeler
you have a bad peeler you can't do
anything I just looked up and I saw
somebody calling somebody a
apparently the conversation is taking a
turn uh you don't know why you're
enjoying it it's because it's awesome
that's
why you're saying to
yourself that man has peeled a cucumber
before yes have peeled a cucumber
before it's not my first rodeo cucumber
wise but I bought all these so I might
as well use
them
since
I prep like the
flash
now soup's getting a little
bit
mature secret
ingredients hello srasa sauce
hello we're going to give it a generous
dollop and now sorry X I have to use
your platform for a minute
here red wine vinegar red wine
vinegar I've never known if I should put
this in closer to the end or if you put
it in early does anybody know you put in
the red wine vinegar early or late both
you top it off I think both was the
right answer
probably measurements nah I don't do
measurements measuring is
for people who don't know to
cook but when you're a expert cooker
like I am you know measure there's no
measuring it's
crazy and then the other thing you ask
yourself is
Scott shall we put some white pepper in
it white pepper anybody white
pepper this is the preferred pepper of
colonizers colonizers prefer this kind
of
pepper and uh no we'll do it the right
way OHA that's a lot of pepper
but I'm pretty sure I'll like it okay
I'll move that I hear I hear you I hear
you I see you and I hear you I moved
it all
right oh my God it's getting
good this might be the best soup anybody
ever made in the history of
soups that's not the only thing I'm
having I'm going have a little SE bass
later but I won't I won't make make you
watch
that all right I think I've got two more
CES two more cukes before we go
nuke before I nuke the
cukes I probably H more than I
should I'm trying to trying to
quit
all right last
one I got some bad news for
you or well not for you really
but bad news is that I'm going to have
to get rid of one of my
strainers my food
strainers I think you see the
problem see the
problem yeah it's a it's a hasbean it's
a
hasbean no it's not a has
Bean now it has bean and it has no
Bean here all night here all night till
midnight it's all good till
midnight all all right
now because we clean as we
go I'm going to make a little space here
for
you you know what I
say got time to lean you got time to
clean yeah I run a very tight shop
here
and you're probably thinking to yourself
why is that camera angle so
wrong
well can't have
everything all
right
now said cucumbers thus
naked will now be turned into smaller
cucumbers through the miracle of
cutting we will have have them and
quarter them or maybe have them I'm
going to have them because they're very
very
small well they I guess it is quartered
technically I'm quartering
them in a
fashion how many people are watching
this on X we got 187 on x 392 on the app
but we don't know the
browser and a thousand people on
YouTube 2,000 people watching me uh
about 2,000 people watching me cut
vegetables or whatever cucumbers
are all right you take said cucumbers
you put them in a
container
you very carefully measure the
amount of
vinegar carefully
measured then wait right there wait
right there you're going to see the most
wasteful thing you've ever seen in your
life coming at
you I don't want to hear any
complaining
don't say it don't say
it and now you have once salted you let
this sit in the fridge for a little bit
won't be good for a few hours but you
don't want it to be there too long
either they get water
loged but this will be a
delight
eventually all right
so it's time to test
the we will test the hardness of one of
these
guys
still a little bit
hard yeah
yeah what do you think about
salt salt the
soup got a yes on salt oh
yeah
booah salt it
is yes I do have an automatic salt
dispenser as everyone
should all right we've got a little bit
of
time uh before I throw the other
ingredients in
there how's everybody doing so
far doing good so far I don't know if
you saw my salt dispenser but I've got
a salt and a pepper and you just turn
them upside down and they
grind so I will
demonstrate but there's also a light
that comes on so you can see you can see
how much salt you're dispensing because
the light illuminates it as it come down
now how much would you like to be able
to see the salt as it comes out am I
right oh
garlic what's wrong with
me where is my garli
garlic we got garlic
somewhere
[Applause]
garlic now I'd love to show
off my gar
skills but but this time I got uh
pre
pre-cut uh do you know the
wow hello do you know the best way sorry
about that guys do you know the best way
to uh get the uh get the wrapper off the
garlic not this wrapper but you know
this get of the
garlic there is there is one best
way um slamming it is one way but the
way we were taught I probably I probably
shouldn't teach you this so yes you can
you can just uh slam it until it's
broken a little bit then it comes right
off the way we used to do it is you put
the knife on top of it don't don't do
this you put the knife on top of it and
you know and then you hit the knife
is that the way you do it does anybody
do it that
way yeah that's the way I that's the way
I learned but it's hard to tell somebody
to slap a
knife as soon as I as soon as I start
saying I'm like am I really going to
teach them to slap a sharp knife I know
it's the side but I don't know I feel
like you could find some way to hurt
yourself if you
tried all right how much garlic does a
thing like this
need and should I cut it or just throw
them in cut it or just throw them
in you cut them or just you slice them
but you're not slicing them small right
you're not you're not um I'm not mincing
them am
I missing it or just breaking
them just
cut some say
mints some say
dice dice
also diced a lot
of boy am I going to smell
bad but in a good
way it'll smell like food so you'll
you'll think I'm
delicious all
right I declare that enough because I'm
bored it's a lot of garlic it's a big
soup it's a big ass
soup uh garlic press I have a garlic
press
but I like the manual
method all right
now
um probably almost
time we're going to do
a solidity
check solidity
check
goes through easily but with a little
bit of resistance oh ho ho hello
that was
hot little
 why these Ruda begar hold the
heat probably won't eat that
one no I didn't I
didn't you wanted me
to
M oh
that's that's rud B
awesome rud big
perfect 5c
rule yes I'll remind you
again um at the end of
the hour at the top of the
hour um I'm going to take the uh going
to take the I keep putting things in
front of
the the xtram I'm surprised you guys are
hanging in here on
X because I gave them is anybody doing a
two screens is anybody double screening
so you can see the board but you can
also see
me I knew there would be some of
you all right hold up is there anybody
who's triple screening is anybody
watching on all three
platforms because I know you got I got
some nerds in here I know I know there
we go I knew one of you would
be I knew one of you would be all
right so we've entered the uh waiting
phase uh but I'm going to have to do
something about my stinky hands so come
with me
me X I'll bring you there in a
minute I'll give you this
view I'm I'm going to give the uh the
folks on X are G to have the view uh
where the spouse tries to talk to you
when the water's
running so I'll pretend I hear
like they're talking to
me what is that honey can't hear you the
water's
running
what no I still can't hear you because
I'm still running
water now still running water now the uh
the rules of physics haven't changed
since I started running the water I'm
running water so can't hear you but when
I'm done I'm definitely going to make an
effort to hear you but I can't hear you
now okay that's a conversation I've had
a few
times all
right see what they're saying is that a
cool
setup I've got this little uh desktop uh
desk and I can put two laptops on it and
you see from the side that all I have to
do is angle the the thing the whatever
the stand is this ISS on a desk it's
just for any kind of standing desk it'll
make your desk into a standing desk and
then I I put the angle of the
iPads so that they're you know one is
pointing down and the other's sorry I
was talking to X
here all right
so ladies and
gentlemen
California you getting uh sandwiches
okay um the kitchen was well the kitchen
was renovated this year so it's a it's a
new newly renovated
kitchen
uh yeah this is this is my best setup
and then I use the uh the clip on uh
wireless mics so they just have a dongle
that sit in the iPad and that's all you
need all right so I'm
thinking that I'm going to throw in my
other
material and get that
cooking what do you think about
that oh you
agree good
probably want to see that
soup
but it's going to be kind of hard to see
all right so we'll take
some
mushrooms I guess I should cut them upm
a little bit they're kind of
ginormous but not too much you like a
like you like a good
shom all right then you
go
mushrooms then you
go wash
them let me let me teach you something
that I learned from a professional
chef you know when you go to a
restaurant and unless it's the very best
restaurant they're still going to have
some of their their stuff packaged when
it comes do you think they wash it in
the back room of the
restaurant do you think if the
restaurant
got something that said pre-washed on it
do you think they wash it
again
nope no they
don't a ask somebody ask a chef no why
would they do do you think let me ask
you this do you think if there were any
chance that this was dangerous if you
were to you know just eat
it you think that they would let it go
out into the
store no way
they're washing it better than you'd
ever wash
it all
right
broccoli is in the
house go
broccoli I now completely run out of
space in My Soup
pot but I I feel like I have to spice it
up a little bit again cuz I added so
much
stuff needs a little bit more
shacha
shacha and needs a little bit
more red
wine this is the
way there we go ladies and
gentlemen what's
Abby all right that once had a stir and
now I do
again the thing I love about
soup is if you overcook it it's
better that's my kind of
food well did you undercook it a little
bit how was it pretty good did you cook
it just right how was it pretty good did
you overcook it yeah how how was it
pretty good pretty
good it's always better than the next
day you like that long slow cooking do
you long slow cooking here you can read
this all right no you
can't your wife can burn
water but can she walk on
it that's kind of your
test that's true you haven't the
soup would you like to see
it all right we'll show you the
soup it's easier it's easier to bring
the soup to
you all
right can you see
it
oo
beautiful I bet you can yeah that's as
far as I can tip it
but you can smell it can't
you it's
amazing all
right I guess I'll put it few things
away because
again think I'll I don't know if I'll
save those mushrooms I don't think
they'll have a better
day it's hobo soup there's a name for it
hobo
soup I call it Scott's
soup it's basically everything I like
and I just put it in a big pot of
boiling soup
stock that works for
me isn't it funny how that
uh terrorist Bridge attempt thing in the
Canadian US
Bridge turned out to be nothing we don't
know what it is yet but wasn't a
terrorist
leave some and stick blend to create a
more creamy sauce oh that's
interesting stick blend it
h it's not a bad idea but um I'm going
to use the method which I used last week
that served me
well
all
right the has aun his face well you know
he should just do what I
did just do what I did you know I really
shouldn't have believed that uh first uh
first
version but I but it sounded like
something I wanted to believe so I
wouldn't with
it yeah but the thing is the's point
the's point stays whether was real or
not it it didn't need to happen to
support his point but you thought it did
I thought it did too I feel like I might
have caused
that you know because I know he watches
my uh my uh
traffic so I I hope I didn't I hope I
didn't help convince him it was real you
know because the more people would say
it's real the more more convincing it
sounds
like I would hate
that all right
so you think uh the V is going to
surprise in
Iowa you
might you
might
now want to join me for some
rice
you want to see the uh my rice
trick you poor poor guys always putting
this in front of you all right I'm going
to show you my rice cooker trick I did
get a new uh
steamer look at this
steamer right I'll turn you around so
you can see
it
so I got this uh thre level steamer you
can do three different things at the
same time but I don't need to do three
different things so I'm not going to use
it today instead I'll be using
this I don't know what that big noise
was but I don't like
it okay
um so let me let me show you my little
trick goes like this all right so the
idea here is that uh you use this
measuring cup and if you do two of these
for example there's a a number two up
here that tells you how much water to
put in it now do you know what some
people do they put down the little
cup and then they take their bag of rice
they try to put this bag of rice in this
little
cup I'm in embarrassed to say that's
sort of what I did for the first 20
years I used the steamer and then bing
bing an idea comes to
me what if what if work with me people
what if you take the little
cup you put it in the place that it's
going to end up and then when you pour
 over
it and some of it goes
everywhere it's still in the cup yeah
that's right that's my Innovation it's
still in the
cup all right not as well okay we lost
one one grain it was a one grain slop
pretty
good but I'm going to wait on this now
if you didn't know the purpose of the
rice
is to be dipped into the
soup so you don't want to put the rice
people people let me tell
you you don't want to you don't want to
put the rice in the soup because it'd be
all soggy
but if you were to
cleverly uh if you were to cleverly put
the rice in on the same spoon that you
were going to eat the soup you'd have
rice that accentuates the flavor of the
soup like it multiplies it by five just
because there's rice on the spoon at the
same time and it kind of it probably at
least triples the flavor experience just
having rice in the same spoon so that's
why I do
it wrong
never oh okay cook the rice with the
broth no I don't like the rice with the
broth sometimes I like it but I like it
I like a nice white rice unsullied
dipped into the into the soup when it's
time that's how I
roll all right how's our time what time
is
