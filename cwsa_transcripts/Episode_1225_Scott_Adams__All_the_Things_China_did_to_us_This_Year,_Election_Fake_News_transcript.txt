hey everybody
good to see you good morning
come on in come on in there's plenty of
seats there's room
you made it you made it on time and
congratulations
those of you who are here at exactly the
appointed time
well you're the self-starters you're the
ones who know
that life doesn't come to you you've got
to go to it
and if you'd like to maximize your
experience and i know you do
all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tanker jealous or steinite
canteen jug or a flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous except it
happens now go
ah divine
well i don't want to get your hopes up
but this might be
the best coffee with scott adams
thank you erica um
and the reason it'll be the best is
because we've got some good news
on coronavirus and such and some fun
news and some
laughs oh yeah it'll be that good let's
start
did you know that we have our first
graduate
from what i call the uh well a graduate
with the life strategy degree
those of you who have been following me
you may have seen me talk about this
it's the idea that you could create a
book list a list of books
that if someone were to read them in
order
they could be said to have achieved a
degree of sort
so i created such a list of books that
if you were to read all of these books
i would want to hire you now of course
those are not the only
variables in the world but if somebody
told me they had read all of the books
that i recommended
for a life strategy uh
degree that person's gonna have a
superpower literally
they will be like walking gods among
regular people if they have all those
strategies
and so we have our first graduate that i
know of there might be other people who
read all the books that i recommended
but
lyle lula tells me on twitter he has
read all of the books
in the order in which i recommend it now
in the comments you're saying hey where
is that book list
where can i find that book list and you
would well you would imagine
i know what you're thinking right now he
wouldn't bring this topic
up unless he could tell us where the
link is
to that list of books but yeah i would
sure i would i'm way less organized than
you think
i'm seeing in the comments that i put
that on the locals
platform so you might have to go to
locals to get it
locals.com and then look for my name
there it's a subscription service
but the point is you don't need to
follow my list of books
i would like to see other notable people
people you've heard of
people maybe that you have some some
feeling of confidence in
i'd like to see warren buffett tell me
the 15 books that if i were to read them
he would say well you know if you got a
college degree and you read these 15
books
i'd hire you i'd like to see
maybe bill gates you know your your list
will be different but
there are some people i would trust
absolutely to put together 15 books that
would change your life
all right here are some predictions i
made let's see how i did
and there should be enough of you who
have heard me make these predictions to
confirm to the rest of you that i really
said this stuff
i told you that if biden becomes
president
the fake news would shift
from mostly being on the left you know
cnn
to mostly being on the right let's say
fox news
so and the reason for this is that if
the the president in office is a
republican
then fox news can say good things what
about what he did
so they have plenty of content saying oh
trump did something good
trump did something else good but the
other team
the team that doesn't have uh you know
their warrior in
office doesn't have real accomplishments
to talk about
because that's not what they want to
talk about so instead they have to
invent
fake news that becomes their content
because otherwise they don't have enough
that their audience wants to look at
so so it was predictable that the
bulk of fake news would go from
certainly cnn msnbc which
wall-to-wall fake news for four years
and and you're gonna see a shift has
that happened yet
is my is my prediction correct
well here's what we know
so a smartmatic which has been under
fire from a lot of
people on the right for their voting
system technology and
alleged uh of vulnerabilities
and they sent a blistering legal threat
to fox news
which caused fox news to
create a package as they say in the news
business a package is a
video segment that's recorded and then
they can play it in different
different times and fox news actually
had to build a package and run it on
three separate shows
saying that their own news was fake
that actually happened now i'm i'm
exaggerating right
so fox news never said our news is fake
but what they did do is create a package
in which they took the very claims that
people had been saying are likely true
such as venezuelan connections
such as george soros and stuff and
apparently they did a point-by-point
debunking of the claims uh from their
own network
and i think it ran on three to three
separate uh shows
uh judge jeanine and uh i think uh
maria bartiroma and lou dobbs
on fox business so i would say that's
fairly
confirming that uh
at least that news was fake news
right i mean just objectively speaking i
know i know you
a lot of my viewers are right leaning
but objectively speaking if you just if
you're just going to be objective
don't you see it you see it right
now cnn and msnbc are still going to
have plenty of fake news but i think
just the emphasis will start moving
right and then
you know if you get a if if things
change they'll go back
i also predicted that 95 of election
claims would be bogus uh
election claims of fraud for example
would be bogus
regardless of whether there was fraud so
whether and of course it was a big
election so there was
some it had to be um
but would you say that's true given that
fox news
just did a package debunking their own
news on fraud
i feel like that 95 estimate was pretty
good
i feel like 95 has been debunked
now if you're in the comments and you're
saying my god no
there's tons of stuff that hasn't been
debunked i would say to you
you probably haven't seen the debunk
doesn't mean it doesn't exist
you might not have seen it because if
you're watching mostly write leading
news you wouldn't see it
you'd have to see it somewhere else but
um i i try to scan the entire
environment i would say 95
has been debunked among those things i
haven't seen debunked
which doesn't mean they're true but i
haven't seen a debunk for the
uh some some of the statistical claims
now i've seen a debunk for the one in uh
quadrillion claim
that was somewhat easily debunked but
the
uh the statistician who says that
um wherever there were dominion
and heart voting machines there's a
clear
five-ish percent bias toward biden
that doesn't make sense in any
historical way
i haven't seen that one debunked so it
only takes one
to be true for the entire election not
to be valid right
you only need one if it's big enough and
that one claim
would be uh very much big enough i mean
it's way big enough
so you only need a few to be true
doesn't matter that 95
or not um
so we've got some reporting that who
knows
i assume this is fake news i'm assuming
that it's at least
fake-ish news and it goes like this
that president trump was met with and
had considering
making cindy powell a special counsel to
look into the voter fraud
does that sound like it's true
it might be i don't think that it could
possibly make a difference
because won't trump be out of office
allegedly in a few weeks how much could
a
how much could a special counsel do in a
lame duck
one month i mean kind of nothing
so while i imagine it's true that the
idea was floated
so i i that's probably true i think the
idea was probably floated
but it looks like it won't happen maybe
and i think maybe it's just not
practical
not enough time to make it work then it
was also
reported that the idea of martial law
was raised by general flynn
do you think that's true i think that's
probably true
ish meaning that the way they talked
about it
or the way they reported it might not be
exactly the
spin that is accurate but i would say
that it makes perfect sense because
flynn has
mentioned this outside of that context
but here's the part that i don't think
the news will tell you
do you know that martial law has been
used
lots of times in the united states did
you know that
probably not right because when you
think of martial law you think of the
whole country being
sort of locked and the military is in
the streets and you know
all forms of uh civilian rule are
suspended and stuff that's
that's what you think of when you think
of martial law right but apparently
martial law can be limited to whatever
situation
is the problem so you don't need a
martial law
that closes down the streets and heads
the military instead of the public
you don't need any of that and the ones
in the past
were similarly limited so it's a scary
sounding term
but it's not a scary sounding thing
it's not a scary technique it's been
used over 60 times i think
in american history you've never even
heard of them
i'll bet there's not one of you who can
men who could
by memory without without searching for
it i'll bet not one of you
could mention a specific case of martial
law
even though you've lived through a whole
bunch of them
right so how scary would it be
if there were martial law declared about
the votes well probably it would be
limited to
something like i'm just guessing this is
speculating it would be limited to
something like
uh using the military to secure the
machines
that's it that's it just using the
military
to make sure that you're guarding the
machine so you can do a proper audit
now i don't know if that's exactly what
flynn had in mind but it's an example of
how limited
martial law can be i think i have that
right if somebody wants to correct me on
that
police do
how would you like to hear some
coronavirus good news
this is all good news some of it is fake
news
some of what i'm about to tell you
almost certainly
isn't true but might be true
these are things that might be true and
if they are they'd be good news
so let me let me run it by you
i had been asking provocatively why if
hydroxychloroquine
in combination with either zinc or
azithromycin or both
if it's so successful as a lot of
retrospective studies say
but not a lot of controlled randomized
studies say for some reason i don't know
why there aren't many of those
but if it works as well as
a lot of people say but not the
not the officials in control or the
experts who
seem to have the consensus of things
when do you see it working in at least
one country so this was my question
by now many months into the pandemic
surely there would be at least one
country
that would say we think there's enough
here that we're just going to go wild
with this
everybody's going to get it and then you
would see if it worked it would be
really obvious
let's say a perfect situation france
this did not happen but i imagine that
it could have
imagined france said you know you're not
all convinced about this
hydroxychloroquine
stuff but we are so for one month
just one month we're just going to give
it to everybody
prophylactically to the extent that we
can then just see what france looks like
compared to the rest of europe that
would tell you something
i mean it's not a randomized controlled
trial but
i feel like that would be pretty
important in terms of knowledge
but that didn't happen however i was
told today that
there is a country that did that
so we're in good shape right because
there is a country that did exactly that
country is andorra you've all been there
right
andorra is uh somewhere in europe it's
so tiny
it only has 77 300 people
it's so small that you have to add the
300 you know 77
300 and uh i think the wilson's just had
a kid that's 301
for andorra so basically the entire
country tiny country of andorra
is the size of a small town or a small
city let's say
and do you think that anything that
happens there
is representative do they have a good
record keeping
are they spread out because there's only
77
300 in the whole country they're
probably not too packed together
i'm thinking i don't know anything about
andorra but
my only point is why did it have to be
if there had to be one country that did
this experiment
why'd it have to be the one that doesn't
give you good data
is that a coincidence this is what makes
me think the simulation is
is in effect because it seems like
there's a there were a lot of countries
that could have tried this that would
have really
been had credible record keeping let's
say south korea
france and germany but why was it the
one place
where the the numbers are small and it's
so different
that you just can't tell what you got
so i'll put this in the maybe good news
maybe good news so we have we do have
one country that used hydroxychloroquine
and say they got good results and maybe
that will move the needle
if it's true there's a new
hydroxychloroquine study
that uh it's a retrospective so it's not
the gold standard kind with randomized
controlled
trials but there are now somebody on
twitter was telling me there are 260
studies
on hydroxychloroquine that say it worked
i think almost all of them are
retrospective not
not the highest quality kind there might
be i don't know if there's a gold
standard out there yet for
hydroxychloroquine
but apparently there's so there's a new
one today but it's only 144 people that
once again
shows a big difference if you use
hydroxychloroquine
so does that mean hydroxychloroquine
works
i'd say that is not
demonstrated yet and it's
annoyingly uh obtuse
i feel as though there should have been
some
international hydroxychloroquine
committee who would just be the ones who
would decide if these studies were good
enough or not
what is the point of following the
experts when there are 260 studies
pointing in one direction
and the experts point in the other
direction
how do you process that as a citizen who
is not an expert
do you process it as uh i feel like
there's a massive
global conspiracy against
hydroxychloroquine
well what would be the other explanation
with so many studies
the other possibility is that there's
something about the nature of
a hydroxychloroquine use
that makes all retrospective studies
look like it works
but whatever whatever it is that makes
it look like it work is sort of a
phantom that
that affects all of them so there could
be one factor
that's not obvious i don't know what it
would be that does just affect all
retrospective studies
but when you do a randomized control
study it it scrubs that
variable out and so you don't get the
same results
could it be that can somebody explain to
me
why so many retrospective studies are in
the same direction
but we're still not confirmed that it
works
and by the way i don't it's my my best
uh instinct on this is that it doesn't
work
because i think the signal would be so
strong by now
months into it that there would be no
doubt about it no there wouldn't be
anybody on the other side
if it worked as well as claimed now
if it's true that this is some kind of
massive global pharma conspiracy
to keep you from using ivermectin which
is another thing that has
good press but we don't know if it's 100
maybe if you told me that the big pharma
companies
were so powerful that they had forced
effectively the the top experts to say
hydroxychloroquine and ivec and the
other one
are are not the big answer i wouldn't
rule that out
because let's let's game this out in our
heads
let's say that it was true worst case
scenario all right we'll just be
conspiracy theorists for a moment
let's say that the big pharma companies
thought that they wouldn't make enough
money on vaccines or whatever
therapeutics if hydroxychloroquine did
work
and they actually hired uh you know
dark arts people to set up a propaganda
thing and
and maybe influence a few top doctors
how many doctors would you have to bribe
or influence let's say you're a
pharma company how many doctors would
you have to bribe or influence
to make sure that you had controlled
doctors in general
because you don't have to influence them
all directly right you have to get the
the key doctors the one the ones that
have the most credibility and the most
reach if you just influenced
i'll pick a number if you
if you if you manipulated and influenced
let's say the 200 most influential
epidemiologists and medical
professionals
would you have influenced them all
if somebody says 100 i feel like if you
influenced
200 medical scientific types
who were the most credible in this area
you don't have to influence the rest of
them i feel like
so is it doable could it actually be
done
do you think that the pharma companies
don't already
have a major connection with the top 200
people in the field
think about it do you think the top 200
people
don't already have pharmaceutical
contracts or at least they think they
might work for them
in the future i feel as if that's not a
high bar
for the pharma companies to influence
200 doctors that
probably already have a relationship
with them if they didn't already have a
relationship
then that's a little extra work right
but if you already have a relationship
and your pharma company that's paying
you i'll just pick an
example let's say your pharma company is
is
uh arranging speaking deals for you
they're actually coming to you with
speaking offers and say hey
there you know there's a couple group
we're working with they'll pay you 20
thousand dollars to give a speech
we'll we'll fly you there and put you up
in a first class hotel
what do you say and the doctor says
really
i don't have to lie or anything i'll
just go and say what i want to say
and the pharma company says yeah
absolutely
because we're your friend and we like
you
we heard of this offer and we thought
you'd be perfect for it
now when that doctor who might be making
let's say 80 000 a year extra
because a pharma company is bringing him
offers
does that person say something that puts
the pharma
pharma company against him kind of hard
so i don't think you could rule out a
massive global conspiracy because it
would probably only have to affect 200
people that they already affect
it might be here's the scary part it
might be
really easy i don't know that but it
might be
i mean common sense tells me a pharma
company could get to 200 people that
they
already control pretty easily
but i'm not going to say that's
happening i'm just saying that
theoretically i don't see what would
stop it
all right here's uh here's the fact
that is gonna make me lose my
 i'm gonna keep it together today
but i'm gonna tell you something that if
this checks out
to be true i'm gonna lose my
but i'll keep it together today we'll
give it a day or so
let people weigh in tell me if this is
true or not because it might be just not
true
or maybe there's a spin on it that i
haven't thought of but here's the fact
that if this is true you're gonna lose
your too
you ready you really haven't you have to
get you
need to be prepared for this one be
prepared
you're gonna get mad okay
there's a chinese study of 10 million um
10 million people who had coronavirus 10
million
10 million people all right and of 10
million people they tried to figure out
what percentage of them got the covid
from asymptomatic spreading so we know
that most of the spreading seems to be
from people have symptoms
but the the reason for the lockdowns
is primarily the asymptomatic people
right
because if you only needed to stop the
people who had symptoms
it would be a little easier just say hey
you have a symptom don't come in the
store
you have a symptom you can't be in the
restaurant now you wouldn't
stop everybody some people would still
commit with symptoms but that's the
current case
right that's the current situation
people still cheat a little bit
but the entire lockdown thing
i think you could say and again fact
check this
wouldn't you say that the entire
lockdown
and even the mask situation has mostly
to do
with asymptomatic spread because you
don't know who has it who doesn't have
it so you got to do maximum control
true so far am i true all right dude
give me a fact check as i go
because really i don't want to lose it
on this but i'm right on the edge
and i think you're going to be in a
minute so out of 10
million people that the chinese checked
so they do
you know they check to see if as best
they can where it
where they got it and then of 10 million
people
who got the coronavirus in china how
what percentage of them
or even what number you could do number
or percentage
what number of them uh were determined
to have caught it from
asymptomatic spreading zero
zero and of 10 million
zero there's a new uh
journal of american medical association
gemma whatever they are
they did a meta-analysis of 54 studies
with 77 000 participants
and they found that the odds of getting
it uh
of an infected person infecting somebody
in the home is 18
if they're symptomatic so if there's
somebody in your home who
has symptoms there's an 18 chance
uh that at least one other person will
get it in the household
now what are the odds according to these
of 54 studies
that someone in the household would get
it if the only person who has it already
is asymptomatic
point seven percent
less than one percent if you're
symptomatic eighteen
now who's right is china right that the
number is literally zero
or is this a meta-analysis of 54 studies
77 000 participants so plenty of people
are they right when they say it's 0.7 in
other words less than 1 percent
i'm not sure it matters does it because
those are close enough
that i don't i don't believe that they
can collect data that would be more
accurate than one percent
do you wouldn't you say that you don't
really know if you got it from the
asymptomatic person or the symptomatic
person
you know if if you know there was
somebody coughing
you don't know you got it from that
person you could have gotten it from the
person you're sitting next to who
doesn't have any symptoms
how would you really know so the first
thing you have to add to this is
can you really do can you really do
contact tracing
is that a thing now it's obviously a
thing
because people do it and the experts say
it works
but is it a thing where you can usually
tell where you got it
or is it a thing where you sort of just
got a good idea
right because basically you're asking
the person where have you been
maybe sometimes you can you can check it
with digital stuff
but you're kind of relying on the least
credible source which is a human saying
no i i think i saw somebody cough at the
grocery store
i don't know i it seems to me you can't
accurately collect this data
right i feel like when you've got a
number like
the asymptomatic spreading of 77 000
people was 0.7
that feels like total to me
doesn't it like because it could be five
percent or it could be zero
but it's you know it's going to be a
pretty gross estimate however
10 million chinese and not one not one
not one now i don't believe that do you
do you believe that n of 10 million
people there there were
not a single asymptomatic spread no
if you believe that you're an idiot
there's no way that that's true
it may be true that they recorded it
that way and that nobody
nobody had a story of anybody who was
asymptomatic but
here's the thing if this checks out
that we can be sure that asymptomatic
spreading is well under one percent
everything we did with masks and
shutdowns was a waste of time
now if we didn't know this
and we did all those things i give that
a free pass
remember some of you remember that early
on in the pandemic i said this
it's going to be fog of war and we're
going to be asking
our leaders to make life and death
decisions
and they won't have the right
information to make those life and death
decisions
but we're going to make them do it it's
their job
they've got to make a decision do
something you're the leader
but you don't have any good information
if they get it wrong
is it their fault i said in advance we
should give
all of our leaders a pass for any
mistakes during the coronavirus
trump probably lost his job
trump probably lost his job
by being right
in other words trump's uh you know let's
say his
less emphasis on lockdowns and less
emphasis on schools
uh schools being closed and less
emphasis on masks
probably if this asymptomatic study
is right trump might have been
right about everything
at this sitting you know at this moment
in time
there's a non-zero chance
trump was right about everything
including hydroxychloroquine
now i'm not saying that
hydroxychloroquine works i feel i still
think it's likely
it doesn't or at least doesn't work
enough
but at this point
there is the the bulk of science
the the great weight of current science
fact check me on this
in my opinion at this moment the way of
science
is strongly on trump's side
fact check me you tell me you tell me
that that's not true as
of today given that the asymptomatic
stuff
now we may learn that the there is more
asymptomatic spreading than these
two studies showed but at current
knowledge current knowledge just what we
know today
trump was right about everything
and he lost
his job he lost his job
being right about everything that that
actually happened
i believe that happened now we could
find out that he wasn't right about
everything because
you know what we think is true just
keeps changing but that's a
that's a kick in the that's a kick in
the nuts i'll tell you
all right here's uh here's some more
apparently here's a little conspiracy
theory for you i don't know what to
believe about this i'll just pass it
along because it's
a fun story but you know people have
been complaining that the
current tests for coronavirus were too
sensitive
apparently you can you can dial up the
sensitivity or dial it down
and uh using the technical words it's i
don't know the
the rct or the cycles have to be you
know under
25 or 30 all that so the the details
don't matter
but apparently the world health
organization has just said
that the tests have been running at too
high a sensitivity
and so the conspiracy theory goes like
this
did the world health organization not
know
before vaccines were available
did they not know that these tests were
being set to be too sensitive
meaning that they found a lot of people
who had
apparently coronavirus but they didn't
meaning maybe they had some
dead viruses in them from the past but
they didn't have coronavirus then they
weren't
symptomatic but the world health
organization now says oh you've been
testing too sensitive
so there's some potentially huge number
of people
who did not have coronavirus in a way
that they could spread it anyway
who were diagnosed as having it
is it a coincidence that they revise
their
thinking so that the vaccines will look
really really effective
because it's because it's a coincidence
i mean it could be
just this is the normal timing of things
but the conspiracy theory is around
you knew this before the vaccines
why are you only telling us after the
vaccines
is that a coincidence it might be
um
now suppose that this is true
and that while the virus is real you
know it's a real virus is really killing
people
but the uh degree of how many people are
affected
was completely fraudulent because the
tests were set in the wrong way
is that possible well the world health
organization is indicating it is
that a lot of people are setting the
tests too high do you know what that
means
means trump is right again
that the reason there are so many uh
apparent infections
is because of the testing i mean
and maybe not exactly the way he said it
but it would mean
that we had over tested too sensitively
and artificially shown numbers too high
i'm not going to give uh i'm not going
to give trump a
an a plus on that but his instinct
that testing was misleading us
he might have been right he might have
been right
all right here's another example where
my complete lack of embarrassment
comes in useful and i talk about this as
a superpower
something i've learned over the years
it's not something you're born with
because we're born with an ability to be
embarrassed quite easily you have to
really work
to make it not bother you and not be a
thing in your life but at this point i
would say
i can report that i don't really get
embarrassed
i just i just don't and it really works
well here's an example so
uh in a recent live stream
i made a completely inaccurate statement
that
uh our air conditioning systems do not
use
uh this uv light the special far uv that
we know kills the virus there might be
some other kind of uv light
and some some units but basically it's
not a thing
turns out it's the thing turns out i'm
completely wrong
so let me so everything you heard me say
uh and again here's where my lack of
embarrassment comes in handy
one of the ways you can attract right
information and help
is by doing something wrong in public i
do this a lot and it works really well
when i do things wrong in public there's
no cost
to me because i don't have embarrassment
but the effect
is that all the people who know i did
something stupid
they flow in they say oh let me correct
you here's a link here's some
knowledge you didn't know and then i
share it with you
so we're all going to get smarter
because i
have lack embarrassment you see how this
works
my lack of embarrassment will now
educate you because
it caused people to flow in and correct
me so christian
holler tells me this i'll just read what
he said because he said it well he said
uh he was surprised about my comments
about uv systems not having that he said
this is incorrect
all that we have checked so he's
involved in this
industry he says all that we have
checked use uvc
which is the correct term for far uvc so
i think one of my problems
was that i didn't recognize that uvc is
synonymous with
far uv so i think that was part of the
reason i thought it wasn't the same
light
and then there was some duke study that
shed that says that many of the
commercial
and residential systems have this
two uvc devices on them and uh that you
would see them in purifiers for
hospitals and stethoscopes sterilizers
and and their vendors testing it
and it's a big thing and there are a few
different technologies
so it's not just the uh you uvc light
but there's also some kind of a
hydrogen peroxide and o3
but it's not legal in california because
of ozone or whatever
so there are a few different
technologies but
here's the problem they're expensive
so they're they're not going to be in
your house so you
so they're expensive you can put them in
a big system in a hospital
but maybe too expensive for your house
here's what i'd like to know
do we have enough data yet that we can
determine
that the locations that have this
technology
have less spread than the places that
don't
now you can't change you won't be able
to check households
but it looks like at this point you
could check maybe a hospital
you could probably check a senior home
you could check any facility that has
one of these and say how do they compare
to the ones that don't have them
so this again is something that i feel
like
uh if nobody's working on finding out
that
if you can tell the difference the
places that have it versus the don't
that's a big big deal isn't it like a
big
big big big deal if it works
because if it works that means it's just
a ch a case of money
now uh what christian said when he was
correcting me he said that uh
uh i believe that they've had this
technology in his home
and they haven't had uh uh we no longer
get colds
it's been 10 years now so his family has
been
10 years without a cold i don't know how
that works if you ever leave the house
but
good for them apparently we have learned
that
china employed a vast army of propaganda
people to manage the coronavirus
messaging when it became clear that it
came out of china
china said oh we got a pr problem and
they mobilized apparently an enormous
army of people to manage the the message
and some of the words that they did not
want to be in headlines
were these incurable fatal
and lockdown about travel articles so
the chinese presumably were managing
even our press
you know i don't know how directly or
how much they could do it but it was
their job to manage the press in the
world
so one assumes that they were at least
trying to influence our local press
and uh i don't remember seeing a lot of
the word incurable and fatal but we did
lose
lockdown a lot at least on social media
so i don't know how much
effect they have but here's a question i
have
our media reported non-stop the fake
news media not
not the real news but the fake news
reported that president trump
had recommended drinking bleach
anderson cooper and cnn that they
actually report it with those words
the actual words drinking bleach
now i have a question for you how do we
know that didn't come from chinese
influence is it possible
that china when they heard that people
were saying
you know the president suggested
drinking bleach
would the chinese propaganda people say
what did we just hear
what did we just hear let's uh let's
amplify this one
is it possible that the reason half of
the people in the united states
literally believe that the president
once speculated about drinking bleach to
cure coronavirus
as if that actually happened uh
is that because of china i don't know
but don't you have to ask the question
at this point if we know that they were
influencing our understanding of the
coronavirus
and we know they didn't like trump and
we know that that's not true that he
said anything about drinking bleach did
it come from china
or did they at least push it i think it
probably happened naturally
in terms of the story but i'll bet they
pushed it a little
so as you know uh pompeo has said that
our big hack that got into all of our
systems in the united states you know
that story
the solar wind to hack he says that it's
quote pretty clearly
russia behind it pretty clearly it's
russia but
president trump has speculated now in
public that maybe it was china
are these two statements in conflict
is there any conflict to say that it's
pretty clearly russia
where trump says maybe it's china
well they're not exactly conflicting but
they're not they're not really
compatible either right it would be
better if the message
had been you know cleanly one or the
other
or some hybrid but it's not exactly
contradicting it because you could be
pretty sure that it was russia and then
later find out
it was actually china so i don't think
trump is wrong about that
and his instincts on stuff are
shockingly good in a lot of ways
wouldn't you say
you make all the criticisms you want
about about trump and
you know his tweets and whatever but
i don't think at this point you can
really question his instincts
i feel like he proved that i feel like
he proved his instincts are good
and here's my instinct about that hack
i don't feel like russia would have been
very smart
to be behind it given all of the
attention on russia and specifically
this exact
problem you know especially if it got
into any of the election stuff
um i feel like
it could have been russia clearly it
could have been russia you know you
can't
you can't say that's a low likelihood it
clearly could have been russia
but doesn't trump want uh
doesn't uh china want trump out of
office more than russia
that would be the common thinking right
i don't know i think that trump just
assumes china would be
more of a malign influence than russia
at the moment
he could be completely wrong but i don't
think you can rule it out
i'd say maybe
how about biden has is using what i
would call the pointy-haired boss
technique now in dilbert the comic
i write about corporate strategies for
getting ahead at the expense of other
people
and stockholders and there's something
i'd call the pointy-haired boss
technique now that's a general term but
this fits under it
so what we're going to watch
is that during the context of the the
vaccines being rolled out
joe biden needs to do something
artificial
that he can later claim was the real
reason the virus was conquered
because the the vaccinations will take
care of the virus
don't you all think that i mean i think
everybody agrees
that at some point i don't know how long
it'll take but at some point
the vaccinations will actually eradicate
the virus
could happen maybe by june but it's
definitely going to happen during the
alleged potential biden administration
so biden has to do the the pointy haired
boss
technique he has to do something that
doesn't have anything to do with
vaccinations while he's also working on
the vaccinations
because the vaccinations are sort of a
trump success
and he needs to say that he did
something else
that was really important to the success
so if he pushes
masks and lockdowns and let's say he
gets some action there
after the vaccinations cure the problem
he will be able to look the public in
the eye and say
thank goodness we had that lockdown it
made all the difference
thank goodness i was tough on wearing
masks
it might be that none of that makes a
difference
as long as you control the symptomatic
people maybe it doesn't make a
difference
uh but that's a really good play so for
for
from the perspective of is it smart yeah
it's really smart
so what biden should do to create the
false impression that he solved the
pandemic
is anything just do anything and then
say that's the thing that mattered
you know of course you'll say the
vaccinations also mattered but you'll be
able to claim some credit
so in uh new york city there's a private
school called the
dalton school and they have uh
made a bunch of proposals for uh
i guess this is a response to the george
floyd situation
so they made a bunch of proposals about
uh making the school
more let's say uh
less systemic racist i guess
and so i want to give you my impression
of i'm guessing there might have been
some white people on the committee
and i will play the part of an average
white person on the committee
when the committee is making the
following proposals and we're discussing
them
and the first proposal is uh
uh i've got an idea um we'd like to
assign a staffer
who will be uh dedicated to helping
black students
who are having some trouble or
complaints in what
is a predominantly white institution
does anybody have a problem with having
a one
assigned staffer who's just there as a
resource
to help our black students who might
feel a little and a place or
might need a little advice everybody
let's go around the table scott
scott what do you think of that uh just
one staffer who's sort of a resource for
our black students
what do you think i'd say oh it's not
bad
you know we don't know if that's going
to make a difference but it's not much
of a
expense i would say that's a strong
proposal
yeah i'm good with that i say yes
so yes on idea one having somebody who's
a resource
idea 2 we want to hire
12 full-time diversity officers and
multiple psychologists to support
students who are quote
coping with race-based traumatic success
or stress 12. i don't know how big the
school is but
it feels like a lot so let's go around
the table
what do you say uh scott what do you
think about this
well i like you know i like the concept
concept's okay you know directionally
but
12. do we do we need 12 of these
plus some psychologists whoa
scott oh we invited you on this
committee hoping you would try to be
helpful
we didn't expect you to go full hiller
in the first meeting
i'll say i'm not really even much
objecting to the idea
i'm just saying that maybe 12 is a big
number
i plus the psychology i'm just saying
i'm just talking about the number
of them i'm not even really pushing back
on the concept so much
yeah that's pretty much how racists
act good try try good try trying to pull
it back now
because it's out i mean you've said it
let's move on to the next thing racist
next proposal is uh we want to
compensate
any student of color who appears in
dalton promotional materials
let's go around the table scott uh what
do you think of that
i'm not sure i understand this are you
saying that if a
white student is in our promotional
materials they won't get paid
but a person of color if they're doing
exactly the same work
that they would get paid am i hearing
this right
yeah that's that's the idea that's
exactly the idea
i'm a little uh
i'm a little bit uncomfortable with this
one i like i sort of like
where you're going with the other ones
but i'm now feeling a little bit
uncomfortable get the out of here
you racist
you racist hitler get out of here you
are
off the committee
seen imagine if you will
literally some white person trying to
push back on any of this
now when i call it there's
actually some good stuff in here
some of it is completely well-meaning
and i look at it and go oh
yeah it would be it looks like a good
idea to have a dedicated staffer
you know somebody that you go to but
look at some of these other ideas
requiring anti-racism statements from
all staffers
so every staffer will be forced
to say what they're told to say
seem good in america
about uh abolishing high-level academic
courses
by 2023 if the performance of black
students
is not on par with non-blacks so just
stop being a school if black people
don't perform well
how about this one they'll donate 50 of
all their fundraising
to new york city public schools if
dalton
is not representative of the city in
terms of gender
race and socioeconomic background and
immigration status
by 2025. so they're saying that all the
the private citizens who are donating to
the schools
because they usually they either went to
the school or their kid is there
so they will take those donations that
are meant for the children's school
and they'll take half of them and give
it away to something else that people
did not want to donate to
and is in fact funded by the government
if they don't match the demographic
profile of the city
some of the worst ideas i've ever seen
in my life
these are really some of the worst ideas
i've ever seen and there's a whole list
of these and every one is worse than
the one before but we've reached a point
where you cannot show your opinion
in public it's quite obvious
it's really obvious that the reason you
get this dalton school thing
is that there was nobody at the school
who could tell you
their real opinion nobody there was not
a single
white person involved in that who who
had any power or had the ability
to simply disagree and say you know i
think this makes things worse
none free speech at the you know at the
in the company level it used to be when
i when i was
in the corporate world the most basic
thing
was you don't uh criticize when you're
brainstorming
you know so that part's good uh but you
could pretty much say anything you
wanted
if you believed it and it was true and
you know you could back it up you were
free to say that a bad idea was
bad but you're not able to do that
anymore you actually can't say a bad
idea is bad
in a meeting in which you've been asked
to give your opinion on the idea
you just can't do it anymore if it's
this topic anyway
and all right
um no free speech no freedom that's true
sums up today's curriculum this is my
show for today i think i had everything
that i wanted to do got you plenty
that's all you want
oh um yeah that's all
all right here is the payoff let's go to
the whiteboard are you ready
i want to teach you how to know what is
true and what is not true at least in
the terms of
the things that are in the political
news and
here's an approach i would like to
promote
and it goes like this you should create
your own
list and i'll give you my starter list
of what i call
high value thinkers now i don't want to
call them like the
the intellectual dark web i don't want
it to be a club
so it's not a fraternity it's not a club
it's not some group
that's you know a fixed group but rather
it's in my experience and opinion
a number of people i'm just using
twitter as my field here my canvas
a number of people who i would say are
unusually
credible and also well informed
so you would have to be credible and
well informed what makes you credible
the only thing that makes you credible
is that you have a history of sometimes
taking the opposite opinion
in other words if you're associated with
the left or the right
have you ever even once
agreed with the other side in public all
right
now this list is not complete i
literally ran out of room
and so if you if you see some somebody
who belongs on the list and isn't here i
see a lot of people saying where's
where's ben shapiro on the list and
maybe he belongs on the list
um sheryl atkinson is on the list i see
you suggesting that
so it's not complete you can add other
people
but let me just run through these to
tell you uh what it is that makes
this group special and why i think
they're high value thinkers
and why if if you're trying to decide if
something in the news is true or not
these are the people to go to all right
but then there's going to be a second
part of this that will be on the other
side
so for example you've seen dershowitz
and jonathan turley know
everything there is to know about the
law it seems anyway
both of them are capable of supporting
something on the left or something on
the right they do it all the time
and they're really smart and they
usually
are really good oh robert barnes i would
put robert barnes on there as well
so there are a number of names that do
belong on here i was just trying to give
you a starter list
um cernovich you can guarantee
that cernovich is giving you an actual
opinion not a
you know political amount of team kind
of opinion because he does it all the
time
now are all the people on this list
right about stuff no
you'll see some people on this list who
are famous for getting stuff wrong
but they don't get most things wrong you
can still get something wrong no matter
how smart you are
oh i did have ben shapiro on the list i
forgot um so this the people on the left
are people who have
experience in the law or law enforcement
in the case of bongino
so if you have anything that has a legal
element to it
this is a good list of people andres
back house i use him as my go-to for
anything
data or logic or economic related he's
just
an extraordinary source i don't even
know if he's left or right
which is amazing imagine interacting
with somebody
on a regular basis about politics and
you don't
know what their opinion is left or right
that's like a home run
right if you can pull that off interact
on politics
extensively and when you're done people
go i don't even know
is does he lean conservative i can't
even tell that's
that's good right so uh
andres backhouse uh molly hemingway i
put on the list just as one of the
clearest
thinkers with the best you know uh full
historical
understanding of issues and politics etc
uh dana prino you can see her on both
sides of issues all the time
you would never expect her to say
anything that she knew to be
untrue just wouldn't happen but you do
see lots of pundits
say things that you think i think even
they know that's not true
but you would never get that out of the
people on this list
glenn grenwall greenwald uh tremendous
voice different look on a lot of things
matt tybee
associated with the left but he's
willing to cross over i put spur connish
on there from cnn
murkonish i'm gonna keep giving him
props
for being non-political on a political
show again he is so fair-minded
that he really stands out on cnn he's
actually quite special that way
uh greg guffeld you'll see him follow
the the data and the issues wherever
they go
uh dr drew for medical stuff if i've got
a
nuclear energy question mark schneider
if it's anything about uh climate change
or
uh the environment michael
schellenberger and then sheryl atkinson
uh
a great political investigative
voice so anybody on that list would be
strong but
since not all of them are right all the
time
here's the second part you want to
triangulate
i'll use that word pick three people
from your list
and here's just an example so if there's
a specific topic
and let's say the the you pick three
people and they all agree
you've got a mike cernovich he says yeah
that's true you got a molly hemingway
she says yeah
that's true and you've got a um andres
backhouse who says yeah the data looks
right the economic argument looks right
if these three people say something's
true
bet on bet on and you could replace
any of these three people with uh the
correct
choices from the other side of the board
so it doesn't have to be these three
these are just three examples
if it were a legal question you'd want
you know dershowitz to be in one of
these boxes
if it's environmental question you want
mike schellenberger to be in one of
these boxes
so this is the technique and
i'm seeing a lot of suggestions of
people i definitely do not
believe belong on the list i don't want
to call out the ones
that i think don't belong on the list uh
because i don't need to be insulting
anybody but there are definitely some
suggestions you made that i wouldn't get
anywhere near this list
and the reason is that they have a
history of being
taking a political side even if the data
doesn't quite support it
so that that's sort of my tell for
somebody who's not going to be a
credible person
now let's say you picked your three
people and
any two of them said yeah that's true
but one says
it's not well if the one who says it's
not is the subject
matter expert maybe you would weigh that
but if they're all say equally
qualified for whatever this question is
two out of three
probably tells you it's likely but not
guaranteed so i think that would be
meaningful you don't need to have three
out of three but three out of three is
better
all right uh somebody says rush is
always right
so actually let me use rush limbaugh as
an example of somebody who's
tremendously knowledgeable and you know
qualified in lots of ways but he does a
political
entertainment show so he does take a
side
he does a great job of defending his
side
but he's really a better side right
so he would not be on my list
even though he's tremendous for the the
specific thing he tells you he's doing
which is entertainment he does that
really well all right
uh so here's the technique
look for people who can uh be on both
sides of an issue
let me take just one example mark levin
i saw that name go by
mark levin super smart
in the law and and in politics so if you
want somebody who knows
the the topic mark levin would be great
but ask yourself this have you seen him
take a democrat
side of anything personally i haven't
if i had he'd be on the list if you've
seen him take
the other side of an issue ever then you
should put him on your list
i just haven't personally seen it so i
don't have that assurance yet so he's
not on my list
so the importance of this is this we
live in a world of
super fake news can't trust the network
news
can't trust your favorite news source
can't trust
anything you see on social media in
isolation
so if you're trying to creep toward the
truth i recommend
this system get yourself a list of
credible people
pick any three of them that make sense
for the topic
and make sure that those three people
are on the same side otherwise
some uncertainty would be in order all
right that's all for today
i will talk to you tomorrow
all right there's your lesson for the
day
um i like all the suggestions that
people are making on uh
different people to add to that you know
i didn't put any
straight news people on there if i had
uh
i would put uh well there are a number
of straight news people that you could
put there but
uh the straight news people uh i feel
like
they've already told you what they know
so you don't need to
you know go beyond that um
all right that's all we got for today
and i will
talk to you tomorrow
