how about that how how about that is
that
better well if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that do not
require my incompetence to hit the wrong
buttons like this morning all you need
for that is a cuper muger glass of
tanker cheler Stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
of the dope mean h of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go so
good so so good all right I'm going to
make sure I can see
your comments
here looking
good no I'm
wrong technical problem which I will fix
right
now what an
adventure oh my
goodness this wouldn't be easy one
though fixed
well we got all kinds of news today it's
amazing did you know that uh Home Depot
will sell you a whole house 540 square
fet pre prefab for
$444,000 so now you can buy a whole
house from Home Depot a whole house from
Amazon um okay just checking let
do we have a
sound can anybody hear
me let it's not entirely clear that I'm
actually
live
anybody any sound at all is there any
kind of a show
happening I can't tell yeah okay looks
like it looks like we have
sound all right well let's just keep on
going here just like there's no problem
at all uh there's new a uh new AI that
can take your script and turn it into a
full movie just from the
script how cool is that you can just
take your movie script and it just
becomes a
movie now I have certainly a lot of
questions whether that really does that
I'm going to predict it's really demo
whereare you know something that
looks like it could work and you wish it
would work but doesn't quite work like
everything else in AI it almost does
something well I think that's what's
going to happen uh but what's different
is that the pitch for funding at the Y
combinator demo day was done with using
AI so the founder pitched it using an AI
version of herself or one of the
founders I think that's kind of cool can
robot read your
mind well there's one called emo now and
it will smile back at you if you
smile and it might change really how you
interact with machines imagine a
robot that knew the correct context to
smile
back I mean just hold that in your mind
that you smile at your robot and it
smiles back that's a
GameChanger that that's the point where
you lose the ability to know it's not
real or that it's not conscious it when
you're robot starts smiling at you
there's almost nothing you'll be able to
do to think that it's not conscious I
don't think it will be but boy isn't
going to seem conscious when it Smiles
at you but apparently this one the one
that
smiles can also read your face and try
to get an idea what your what your
attitude is so now they have ai that'll
listen to your words for your emotional
state but this one will look at your
face and your body language so yes the
robots are getting into our emotional
space and that's going to be a problem
you may have seen this story it's not
too new but there was a New Jersey
postal worker who had been just throwing
away the mail which by the way is not
that
uncommon sometimes it's just easier to
go home and throw the mail away than it
is to deliver it all over town that's a
lot of work so sometimes ma you'll hear
the story about a male person who just
would take the mail home and dump it in
the you know his living room or
something well but this one has an extra
element to it there were 99 election
ballots in this uh two 2,000 pieces of
mail now there's no indication that the
male person had any political motive or
that throwing the mail had away had
anything to do with
ballots but well here's my
question how did they detect that he
threw the mail
away was it because somebody knew about
their ballot
missing is that what
happened let's see let me see if I can
figure out how to go private on
this cuz I'm still I'm still getting
people getting trolls telling me there's
no
sound and I don't think that they're
real people I think they're
trolls they're trolls right sound is
fine yeah I'm not going to ask
again all right um so the question is
would does our election system detect if
a male person throws the mail
away how in the world did they know that
uh any male was missing in the first
place now I didn't see that in the story
but the but here's where I would sound
the alarm here's what I expected to see
in the story there were 99 ballots that
were thrown
away and uh 10 of those 99 people
complained because they knew their
ballot didn't reach its
destination so when they tracked it down
they could easily figure out which
postal person it was because of where
the the ballot Dropbox
was do you think that happened do you
think that the election process
picked up that ballots were thrown
away because if it didn't pick it
up then what we did is we outsourced our
election
security to the post
office the post
office because I can't think of a more
secure environment than the post
office but looks like that's what we
did well vigilantism is is breaking out
right on schedule there are three
stories in the news just
today of people taking matters into
their own hands
surprise surprise people feel there's no
law and so men men are starting to take
the law into their own
hands um one example is Walter Isaacson
who used to be the CEO of CNN I guess
and he was at some event and some
protest to some non-binary protester was
disturbing it so Walter Isaacson who was
72 years old decided to personally
escort that person out which allegedly
turned into some
shoving but he was
removed so alter isacon just dragged
some Bastard out of the room and shoved
him out of the room now he's in trouble
you know the obviously the protesters is
going to file charges for assault but
you know it's like some scratches on his
arm or something
um there's a New York City man who was
in the news today for catching a porch
pirate his his stuff kept getting stolen
so he put a fake package out there and
waited for the porch pirate and then
went out with his baseball bat and uh
called the authorities and got him
arrested so Walter Isaacson getting
physical with a protester New York City
man setting his own trap and using
physical force violent
then there's a story of a Arizona State
um attorney was grilling a woman because
her
husband um had fired at what what was
supposed to be a warning shot because
there were a bunch of migrants illegally
crossing his
land so he sends out the
uh sends out a uh he does a warning shot
and apparently with the warning shot his
somebody so now there's some legal
difficulty now I don't know if it was
really a warning shot makes you wonder
if it was really a warning shot but uh
there's three examples in the news just
today of men deciding they had enough do
you think it's a trend do you think you
will see more stories of men deciding
they've had enough yes you
will yes she will there's no way this is
going to stop there's going to be a
whole bunch more men just figuring it
out on their own cuz what choice do you
have what choice you don't have a choice
it's either let it happen or fix it and
you're going to go to jail if you try to
fix it well Apple uh you know Apple was
going to try to do a car but then they
gave up on the
car and uh now there's talk in Bloomberg
that they're going to make a robot
personal robot doesn't that make more
sense don't you think Apple should make
a personal robot and not so much a
car I think getting into the car
business would probably have been a
mistake so they probably made the right
choice to get out of it but an apple
robot that's working with your other
Apple
devices absolutely I I want an apple
robot just to be my remote
control I just want to tell my robot
what to turn on and off it's like hey uh
robot can you turn on Netflix find
something for
me um however I CAU you that this report
is in Bloomberg and Bloomberg is not a
credible source of news how do I know
that well I know that because Bloomberg
wants to a story about me so I can say
authoritatively that it's not a real
source of
news now the rest of you have to guess
but I've been there yeah I I know they
make up at least they did about me
so I wouldn't trust anything they say
but it might be
true well we've got the caedon coming
it's like Armageddon with
cicas what's the other name for a cicada
is it like a
locust is a cicada like Locust or is
that like a completely different bug
does anybody know cicada I don't know I
just don't like them but apparently
they're every 17 years they emerge and I
guess there's two types and by
coincidence their their their very long
gestation period or hibernation or
whatever the hell they do um they lined
up so we're can to have two
cicada invasions at the same time how
many cicas are we talking
about
trillions
trillions I remember when nothing was
trillions do you remember that when when
nothing was
trillions yeah there was no trillionaire
we weren't we didn't have a trillion
dollar budget deficit now everything's a
trillion like even the bugs are a
trillion now come
on how many people died in Gaza a
trillion everything's a
trillion not really a trillion I made
that part up in case you didn't know
didn't come from Bloomberg
News well just the news that's a news
entity called just the news
um reports there's a structural racism
class that's mandatory for the UCLA
Medical School well you definitely don't
want your doctor not to have a mandatory
racism class but what what sorts of
things do they learn H let's see uh
during the lecture the mandatory UCLA
Medical School class on structural
racism the guest speaker uh led the
students in uh some kind of nonsecular
prayer to Mama
Earth and then got them to chant free
free
Palestine uh denigrated medicine as
white
science oh my
God and apparently some of them were you
know refusing to go along so there were
some there were some resistance to it
but you know I almost want to go back to
the corporate world just so I can
experience this you know as the
cartoonist not as a regular person just
so I can mock
it that'd be
fun well the daily wire launches a new
courtroom reality show starring starring
their one of their on air hosts Matt
Walsh who to the best of my
understanding uh
is is not a judge but I saw the clips
for it and I gotta
say it looks like a
winner it looks like a just like a dead
winner because all it is is Matt Walsh
mocking idiots but in a courtroom
setting where they have to listen to him
and he's got a he's got a little a
little Hammer to
bang now whoever came up with this idea
the very idea of it is so absurd because
he's not a
judge but he's very judgy like like his
whole job his whole job basically is you
know writing and talking in a judgmental
way about things so to have him uh
wearing his little robe and banging his
gavel and mocking idiots on camera I'm
I'm down for it I'm down for it haven't
seen the show but I feel like I can
recommend it you know at least give it a
chance all right uh California's
governor Newsome introduced this new
plan I guess this is going to happen in
California that every baby born in
California is going to get a college
save account at Birth worth up to
$1,500 what do you think of that
idea giving kids $1,500 at Birth and you
just let it sit there and as an
investment I guess and build up
steam I don't know almost every other
topic almost every other topic I can say
oh you know that's good or that's bad
this one's a little unclear because I'd
have to see the
math I would have to see the math there
there's something very appealing about
it and he they didn't invent this idea
and and the idea goes like this if you
give a kid $1,500 today it might you
know grow in value and by the time
they're ready to go to college you don't
need to give them the loan they can't
pay
back that would actually be a good
investment might even encourage people
to get more education than they would
have otherwise so there there's a whole
bunch that got some weird tickle on my
nose
um it might be a good
idea I can't decide you know if you look
in the short run it's just giving people
money but in the long
run could it be so good that we're all
happy to happened I know I but well it
if it's invested it will it will grow
faster than inflation if you do it
right I don't know I'm open-minded on
that one that might not be a gigantic
mistake which would be quite a
difference from everything else
California does by the way is anybody
experiencing a blizzard
today any
blizzards nice day here in
California I'll be taking a nice walk
with my te just in my t-shirt might be
shorts weather I'm not sure but um
that's why I live in California if you
say why do you live in California with
all these many many management problems
this is why this is why I I wanted to
live somewhere where I Wouldn't Die just
because I went
Outdoors that's not a good enough reason
how' you die well I made the mistake of
going Outdoors nope won't kill me right
away
here uh The Daily
Mail has a report that says Uh there's a
new study a landmark 50 year study about
trans
kids are you surprised to learn that
almost all the trans kids grow out of
being trans by the time they're adults
it's just a
phase
so I don't know it said most I don't
know if that's 51% or 91% but most go
through a phase so if you knew that most
whatever most means at least
50%
um it's a
phase how in the world is it legal to
transition
kids how in how in any sane world is
that
legal when it's a 5050 bet yeah at best
it's probably less than
5050 it's just amazing and how many of
you are surprised is anybody surprised
that it's a phase that many kids go
through and grow out of course not
because you can
kids of absolutely anything kids will
believe whatever and if their if their
body chemistry is not caught up to their
you know
sex you could totally see why they would
think they're the other thing yeah how
hard is it to imagine a let's say a
tomboyish girl who's just going through
a phase thinking it's not a phase that
would be pretty normal yeah same with h
you know some little boy boy wants to
wear a dress cuz he thinks it's funny
and then likes it a little bit probably
just a phase yeah so maybe we should
stop mutilating
children uh because it might be good for
one of
them well Charlamagne the god who's uh
hosting on The Daily
Show um he said among other things the
truth about Dei is that although it's
well-intentioned it's mostly
garbage and then he played a Montage of
conservatives mocking Dei by changing
the letters you know to mean something
besides diversity equity and inclusion
one of the clips he played was uh uh
Greg geld saying uh uh di is didn't earn
it now I didn't make that one up I stole
it from somebody on the internet whose
name I didn't manage to write down at
the time but uh that one's just a
killer yeah well when you see didn't
earn it that really should straighten
out your thinking because the the issue
is that people will think that not that
it's not not that it's going to be true
for every person it's just that that's
what people will think it's just
automatic of course you're going to
think that but um although Charlemagne
did say that di allowed racist to be
openly racist the examples he gave were
things like people saying oh must have
been a de Dei hire that caused that bar
at the
bridge is it
racist to speculate that the barge might
have been a Dei situation is that racist
give me the ruling racist or not
racist what do you
say um it sounds a little uh a little
sus to me so that's why I Didn't Do It
um since there was no evidence that
there was any Dei or even any racial
element to the accident whatsoever I
think it's a mistake to try to sell your
Dei philosophy based on an
accident right I think it's a it's it's
a persuasion mistake to over apply the
Dei thinking to say oh well I think I'll
win an extra point by saying this
accident might have been
Dei this it's just not it's not a good
look it's not good for the world it's
not good for your argument
it's a little
racist do you agree or
no I mean I you know me so I'm I'm
primed to not see things as racist but
that looks it's too far A little too far
so that's my take I would agree with
charlam on both points that Dei is
well-intentioned but mostly garbage
exactly and but the garbage is you know
the all the BS corporate part you know
good idea ruined
why getting a lot of comments on
that well it is funny okay I I'll give
you that blaming the barge on
Dei it's a little
funny because it's a what the thing that
makes something funny is an
oversimplification that's just
automatically funny so if you say oh the
bar is a Dei hire that is a humorous
exaggeration over simplification with no
evidence to support it which is why it's
funny it's funny because it kind of
doesn't fit that's what makes it funny
if it was just what happened well then
it wouldn't be a joke it would be
description of what happened so yeah
it's because it's a little bit too far
well it's just too far let's not say a
little
bit however my uh my take on this is
that the has broken on Dei if
Charlamagne the god um being a prominent
voice can say in
public you know with lots of thinking
about it in advance that Dei is mostly
garbage and that it's probably having a
backfire
effect I think the dam just broke that
means that other people can say it
too he he's making it safe so he's
taking the arrow in the back on this and
I think he's uh doing a public
service so good for you I'd say good
work not only that but I thought he
Charlemagne is growing into the job the
the first clip I saw of him doing The
Daily
Show my my first impression honestly
was you know I'm glad he got a chance
but he can't really deliver the joke you
know I felt he was falling short on the
delivery
but I don't know how many shows he's
done now but I watched this clip and I
would say yeah he grew into it he
actually grew into it yeah he actually
solved he he went into a new situation
which by the way is my highest
compliment my highest compliment is he
went into a new situation which could
have been super embarrassing did it stop
him no no he just did it anyway was his
first day out a huge win nope nope
it was a little bit embarrassing
honestly but did he feel the
embarrassment I don't know all I know is
he kept at it and then they got good at
it so that's my that's that's A+ there's
nothing you can say about that but A+
good job I like to see good work I like
to call it out when people do good jobs
that's a good
job well China apparently hacked into
Microsoft's mail and got into the
accounts of some top Us official
officials and people are saying that
Microsoft the critics are saying that
Microsoft has a a culture of not taking
security as seriously as they should but
you know that's something critics say
who knows how seriously anybody's
thinking but um here's something that
was a quote from that story uh while no
organization is immune to Cyber attack
from well-resourced
adversaries no
organization there's no organization
that's immune from Cyber attack
huh no
organization
wow well that's not entirely true is it
that no organization is safe from
hackers well let me give you an example
of of a
organization that's completely
safe all 50 states election
systems all of them pristine
boy do they take security seriously
there not at a place like
Microsoft no the Microsoft smartest
people in the entire
World um on security and Technology they
they what you know those clowns they're
not even taking it seriously but luckily
luckily people and this is what protects
the
Republic every single person involved in
our elections
and especially the election security
unlike Microsoft you a bunch of
clowns just walking around the the
Microsoft people yeah have I ever done
an impression of Microsoft people just
walking around they're like
this really just idiots complete
idiots I know I know what you're going
to say you're going to say Scott they
recruit the smartest people in the world
and the best people in their in their
field that's true but then you find out
they're all lacks about this internet
security and what can I conclude because
it's not like you can't do it it's not
like it's not easy how do I know
Internet Security is
easy 50 elections people listen to me
all 50 election systems pristine
unhackable completely secured and yet
and yet Microsoft can't figure it
out come on
Microsoft thank goodness our elections
are some weak can
trust well Biden Administration has
canceled their plans to refill the
emergency oil
reserves turns out the uh prices are too
high so because the prices are too high
we'll just
not be ready for a
war H I wonder if there are any risks of
hiring the wrong
president what did the other president
do oh he filled the reserves when oil
prices were really low and oil prices
were low because he was such a pro-
energy
president you know in a way that all
worked out didn't it
being pro- energy drives down the prices
you say hey prices are low let's fill
that Reserve make sure nobody attacks us
because we look all prepared but Biden
went the other
way uh destroy the energy industry make
the price is high use up all the cheap
gas so that we'll be vulnerable if we're
attacked
okay but uh at least that's the only bad
thing Biden's doing can we agree on that
at least no other mistakes Flawless
pristine I say again
pristin well here's another story about
Biden he's trying to overthrow the
government of an ally uh
Israel okay that's not ideal but there's
a the reporting is that um the United
States is uh encouraging these fake
protests so it looks like the the people
are against Netanyahu
uh they're going to extort ministers in
the Israeli government the rich ones
telling them they'll clamp down on their
businesses internationally if they don't
get rid of Netanyahu and America is
building a port in Gaza allegedly to
deliver aid but probably to take
military control of Gaza away from
Israel some say now is this reporting
true I don't
know sounds true because the way our
intelligence people work is they always
have to have a fake protest when they
want to overthrow a
government do you remember black lives
matter and
antifa that was our intelligence people
creating fake protests now we know
they're fake because they stopped as
soon as Biden was President duh and it's
the same technique they used in you know
80 other countries they overthrew so as
soon as you see there's a bunch of fake
protests that means America's Tred to
overthrow your
country that that's basically a really
good sign that they're trying to
overthrow your
country so some of the reporting here I
can't confirm and some of it is an
interpretation and a little bit of mind
reading but does it look to you like
Biden wants to get rid of
Netanyahu I say yes if I had to bet on
it it looks like it's exactly what it
looks like yeah that they're trying to
get rid of Netanyahu so not not only is
Biden um trying to get rid of his
competition both Trump and RFK Jr in
different ways using law fair not giving
security to RFK Jr keeping him off the
ballot um he's the most
undemocratic president certainly in
American history I don't think you
nobody's Come Close RFK junr just says
straight out that Biden's the biggest
threat to Freedom because he actually he
he's done massive First Amendment
violations meaning the government work
with private entities to censor and the
things they censored were the
truth it's bad enough that you censor
but they censored really vital important
truths like really really important to
your health the co for
example so yes Biden's overthrowing
other countries are
allies so so he's quite the
anti-democracy
guy here's a question that uh I had in
my mind and I said to myself well I can
get an answer to this question by using
uh Google and
searching and what watch how easy this
is to get the right answer I'm going to
ask you for the answer first and then
I'll check Google and make sure that
your answer is correct okay here's the
question are seed oils good for your
health bad for your health or no
difference seed oils good for your
health bad for your health or no
difference in the
comments well if you're on the
internet you'll see all the smart people
say seed oils are maybe the worst thing
you could have in your
body right so olive oil is still good
avocado oil is still good because
they're not based on the seeds are based
on the the fruit I guess so so a lot of
you are saying bad the seed now I didn't
know one way or the other but I've seen
a lot of smart people say it's bad based
on science so I went to Google and I
said our seed oils bad what do you think
it told me no they're fine they're
fine so what's
true do you think that big food has any
control over uh
Google because I looked at the sources
and the Harvard th Chan School of Public
Health says uh the whole seed oil thing
is BS and there's no real risk from it
at all it's fine that's Harvard Harvard
School of Public Health says no real
risk is Harvard a credible
Source no are you kidding me no
Harvard's not a credible source for
anything I don't know if they ever were
but we certainly don't think they are
now it's basically the Bloomberg of
colleges so I don't know so as of this
morning I don't even have a best
guess I do not have a best
guess my I mean it's easy to keep away
from them uh well actually it's not easy
because it's in
dressings so I try to avoid any kind of
dressing from a restaurant or door Dash
so I don't I don't use their dressings
usually and I guess there was a reason
for that so I don't know I don't know if
the seed oils are bad I just know the
sources can't be
trusted um I saw Mike sovich talking
about uh the government keeps talking
about solar flares disrupting things and
he thinks they might be priming you so
that election day might be hey solar
flare you know wa we got all the mailin
ballots cuz they were mailed in before
but the the same day voting with our
machines oh can't do it I guess there'll
be long delays in all those Republican
precincts because ah the solar flare got
us well yes it's we can't we can't
explain
it didn't that happen in Maricopa
Maricopa their machines all like
mysteriously stopped working on Election
Day and now we got solar
flares well well I will not go as far as
CNO is in saying that it's part of a
plan but I do like his pattern
recognition so his pattern recognition
picked up this pattern he could be right
yeah I I don't have a intuition about
this in particular but yeah I would be
amazed if they don't have massive
technical problems on Election Day
because the technical problems on
Election Day will always work against
Republicans so of course they're going
to have technical problems why wouldn't
they a technical problem is the easiest
thing to fake what could be easier to
fake than a technical
Problem by far the easiest Yeah by far
the easiest so yeah I would expect some
technical problem whether they blame it
on solar flares or
not all right um Sage Steel is a
journalist and she's telling us that
when she did a ESPN interview for Biden
that she was she was given the questions
word for word and told she couldn't ask
follow-up
questions so on
ABC
ESPN yeah I think they own ESPN right
their
journalist now keep in mind this is a
professional
journalist the journalist was given by
management the questions to ask and told
that she can't ask follow-up questions
so in other words if she asks a question
and Biden just lies to her face she has
to
say next
question and just let it lay and that
was her specific
direction from her
bosses yeah in case you're wondering if
things are as rigged as you think oh
yeah they're totally
rigged all right Trump is uh still
thinking about how to uh clarify his
abortion situation I'm going to make a
suggestion for the very best thing he
could do are you
ready the single
hardest persuasion challenge of all
time I'm going to tell you what Trump
and maybe Trump alone maybe nobody else
could get away with this but there is an
out he does have a way to
to um to say what he believes at the
same time it softens the problem for
Republicans all right listen to this
carefully and this is one that you've
never heard anybody use before I may
have mentioned it but you've never heard
a politician say
this this is what I'd say if I were
president the president of the United
States should only favor
life in every
situation no exceptions American Life
American
Life the American president should
always favor life and should never make
decisions in those gray areas when it
comes to Americans living or
dying but there are going to be cases
where tough choices have to be made you
don't want the president to make those
choices you want your president to be
commander-in-chief if somebody attacks
you right if somebody attacks us I say
president whoever you are doesn't matter
who it is you have all the power you
need do what you have to do now in that
case I want the president to make all
the decisions you know the immediate
ones you you know obviously with
Consulting with experts and Generals but
that's a case where you really want your
president to take all the power because
it's just the way you're going to stay
alive but if it's domestic
and it's a b
America the President should never be on
the side of anything that
even even in the most ambiguous case
could reduce life in the United States
but somebody has to make those decisions
who should it
be well because it's life and death you
want that decision to be driven as close
as possible to the people directly
involved ideally you know the doctor and
and the uh patient but if you can't get
it all the way down to the doctor and
the patient the state is a lot
closer and so the one thing I can get
right as your president is I can take it
out of my hands if you want to know my
personal opinion then you add your
personal opinion my personal opinion is
you know I think this or that but I do
not want in any way to be part of the
decision of life and death in your
personal very private moments if the
state wants to do it that's between the
state and its citizens but absolutely
the president of the United States
should never ever be against life even
if it's an ambiguous
case now could he get away with
that yeah he
could everybody would hate it but it
would be hated
equally just right
the Republicans who are you know ban
abortion are going to say ah we hoped
you would do a National Abortion bill
you know Banning it and Trump would say
you don't want me in that business and
then the the Democrats would say but you
should be in favor of abortion and then
he would say you don't want me in that
business you want everybody else there's
there should be only one exception of
the person who should say I'll take a
pass just the president he's the only
one who should take a
pass could Trump sell
that yes better than every other
option now I I don't think he'll do this
by the way I think what he'll do is some
version of um you know the states the
states need to decide but if it's up to
me I would have several exceptions and I
would treat it as sort of a negotiated
Middle Ground so that's probably what
he's going to do is that good
enough I don't think it's going to gain
him any votes the best he can do is
reduce how many votes he
loses and that would
reduce probably give him a little boost
you know because it wouldn't be a hard
commitment but um yeah there's no right
answer let's do a trump lawfare
update uh we've got a judge who's uh
doing some mind reading
um let's see the judge has rejected
Trump's bid to delay the hush money that
stormmy Daniels hush money criminal
trial until the Supreme Court rules on
presidential immunity so in other words
there's H the possibility that the
president would have all kinds of
immunity and if that were the case then
this and other things would be um you
know irrelevant they would just go
away or would they be delayed until
after he's president no he that would go
away because he did it under the cover
of presidency but uh the judge merchin
decided that he would not wait to find
out if the whole case would just go away
because he was president and he had he
had that
immunity um and the reason he says that
he's not going to wait for that decision
is he goes the timing of the de defense
filing quote raises real questions about
the sincerity and actual purpose of the
motion
what why does the sincerity of the
request change the
law is that a
thing I'm sure it is a thing but it
doesn't sound right to me shouldn't the
law just be the
law now I get that you know if you kill
somebody in self-defense your intentions
are different than if you just murdered
them so yeah what you're thinking
matters but if you are if you're lawyers
and you're doing everything you can for
your client and the law allows you to do
this where does sincerity come into
it how much more sincere do you have to
be to think maybe this whole thing
should go away and and we should at
least find out if he has
immunity that's the most sincere thing I
could even imagine all right I'm I'm
Trump's lawyer and I know that there
could be this future thing that's going
to happen anyway and it's going to
decide whether this case makes any
difference at all how am I not sincere
when I ask you to wait for that
decision how in the world is that not
sincere it's strategically
correct it's legally
correct it's
logical it's exactly what they should be
doing for their
client and they didn't make up any of it
it's real stuff like there really is an
immunity decision and it's not very far
away how does a judge look into their
minds and see that they're insincere
when every indication is that they
are there's not a single indication that
there's anything but good lawyering with
a strong argument I don't see anything I
don't see anything else except a strong
argument oh no I'm looking into their
brain I'm seeing a lack of
sincerity in the world is this allowed
anyway uh and but part of it is they
missed some deadlines to do it earlier
but again I say it's either legal to do
it now or it's not
legal the fact that they missed an
earlier
deadline how's that
relevant how's that
relevant it should be just it's legal or
it's not legal and if it's legal they're
just doing good Laing lawyering maybe
they didn't in the past but that would
be not a reason to penalize them now
well how about this uh box gate trial
the maralago secret
boxes um I guess Jack Smith is going
after the judge and threatening the
judge with you know professional
repercussions
um as well as you know the Biden people
are going after any lawyer who ever
worked for Trump so this seems to be
more more the uh non-democratic process
using
lawfare yeah so when you see it all as a
group of actions the there never has
been a president more against the
Constitution than Biden can we say that
for sure there's no president who's ever
been more
anti-constitution because he's
completely taken out the first amendment
by by workaround you know using these
Nos and Soros funded things and fake
fact Checkers and you know the social
media pressure and everything so the
first amendment's gone he's he's
chipping away at the Second Amendment
doing the best he can and now they're
using a lawfare weaponizing the justice
system trying to keep people off the B
the ballot we've never seen anything
like this this is not even in the domain
of anything we've ever seen before
unless unless there's some you know old
presidential story I don't know about
I've never seen anything like this this
is so right in your face um we're just
going to get rid of this whole
Constitution
thing and of course Dei is all just
racist
 so um so that's happening
Politico um has a uh an article from
somebody named Rory Daniels who is a
Democrat donor we're told by people who
don't like his story and he says that uh
he's some kind of China
expert I I say laughingly cuz he he says
that um China prefers
Trump all right so a Democrat who
actually funds Democrats writes in
Politico that in his opinion China
really wants Trump do you think that's
real that China wants
Trump that seems ridiculous
this seems
ridiculous anyway but people will
believe anything did you know that uh
there's a a new development apparently
we can now predict prime
numbers which is the thing that the
experts thought could never be done when
I say predict them I mean predict the
next one that we'll discover you know
which could be you know 20 digits long
or you know some gigantic number but
allegedly it was supposed to be
impossible to predict but now there's um
some mathematicians who think they can
and have so they've they've actually
tried it out made a prediction I think
it
worked so there some researchers in the
Hong Kong and North
Carolina I don't know what good that is
but I I put that in the category of
everything you thought was true is not
true if you just if you just picked
anything that you thought was true and
wait 20 years
it's probably not you could almost throw
a dart at any guaranteed true thing how
about the Big
Bang throw a dart at that do you think
the Big Bang is proven out no it's kind
of largely been debunked the most basic
thing I ever learned in science how
about Evolution now that's pretty
guaranteed right there's there's just so
much proof for evolution well unless
we're a simulation and unless you
believe physics and you believe the
uh the the double sled experiment do you
believe Schrodinger's
cat do you believe that there's such
thing as you know the cat is both living
and dead in the Box let me say it a
different way the cat is not both alive
and dead in the
Box do you all know the Sher cat example
you put the cat in a box that nobody can
see anything that's happening inside but
there's a randomized poison so you don't
know if the poison has been randomly
activated or not so for you on the
outside of the box you don't know if the
cat is alive or dead physics suggests
that both States exist until
observed that when you open the box that
cat will be either alive or
dead but here's the fun
part that means you're creating history
in the present that means your
observation creates the past because if
the cat was not guaranteed alive or not
guaranteed dead until you open the box
the moment you see the dead cat the
history of the cat dying appears at the
same time the history didn't
exist until the cat was seen dead do you
get that we have proof that we create
history on the Fly and we've had it for
a long time we just don't interpret it
that way instead we interpreted that the
cat was both alive and dead no that's
absurd
that's an
absurdity but if we're a simulation and
all indications in my opinion are that
we are then it would act like a video
game that you don't see the forest until
your character goes into the forest and
then it creates it because it needs a
forest so you create the
past you don't you don't just observe it
it was there
anyway so what was that all
about
I don't even know why I was going down
that path but I'm sure I connected to
something important in today's
news Well moving on
um Rasmus and poll says in a three-way
match between Biden Trump and RFK Jr
that 44% would go for Trump and 38 for
Biden and 10% for Kennedy so every poll
seems to suggest that Trump has a um
insurmountable lead especially in the
swing States most of them all but one or
some say all of them he's ahead and it's
a pretty big
lead well as you know uh Biden raised
$26 million in his big celebrity bash
recently and it was a record everybody
said it's historic nobody could ever
beat that number he's the best
fundraiser of all oh okay well looks
like Trump's going to raise 43 million
at a Palm Beach fundraiser this weekend
they project so 43 million would be the
new record record by
aot let's see what other records has
Trump
set let's see he made more money as
president than any president ever
because he got cancelled and created
true social and it went
public he's got quite a few records
there never started a
war never started a war that's pretty
good record all right Wall Street
Journal is reporting that uh men are
leaving the Democrat party and droves
especially black and Latino young
voters apparently every group is having
a little um a little bit of second
thought about Biden but men in
particular are especially leaving so the
Wall Street Journal poll found that
Biden was drawing only 37% of men in the
seven swing
States uh now that was on a ballot with
only him and Trump so without RFK Jr but
um and that found about the same
Nationwide
and that is way weaker than
uh Biden had 46% of men in 2020 so he's
gone from 46 down to 37% of men as
mostly minority men because the white
guys had already left the ones with
testosterone had already left
so do any of you remember when I first
started saying that Democrats were the
party of
women has anybody been with me long
enough you remember the first time I
said
that I think it was during Hillary's run
against
Trump if I
recall and you could see then that
Hillary was turning into the party of
women but now it's a thing the the men
are abandoning it they see it's a party
of women uh I'm going to take some
credit for being the first person to
notice that that it was going that way
I'm sure other people noticed it but
they're you know I nobody made as much
noise about it as I did well here's the
thing if the Democrats are the party of
women liberal women and we know their
rate of mental illness I would put it as
70% I think 70% of liberal women have
mental illness around 50% have diagnosed
or have sought
treatment so if 50% are sought
treatment at least 70% are suffer uing
now how many of them are only suffering
from TDS and didn't seek
treatment it might be
90% have
Bonafide observable mental
problems so if the men are leaving at
this rate it completely turns over the
Democrat Party to people who are not
figuratively
crazy not using
hyperbole it literally is a filtering
process left all the crazy people in one
place now is that
predictable that if you get enough crazy
people there'll be a point where
everything breaks and the people who
don't want to be around crazy people
just get the hell out of there that's
what's happening the men are realizing
that they're they're with crazy people
actually crazy and the men are saying
what the hell is going on get me out of
here I want to go where like my work
makes a difference and if I succeed I
get to keep my money you know not crazy
things yeah get the
foa so why is it that so many liberal
women are crazy well part of it's the
news making them crazy in TDS and you
know maybe it's the phones and all this
but I've got another I have another
hypothesis as you know I like to do some
work at Starbucks quite often because
it's a great environment to bring your
laptop and get a little extra work done
while you have some delicious coffee but
I also am sitting the air wall and
watching everybody else's
orders if a man comes in there's a
pretty good chance that man's getting a
cup of
coffee if a woman comes in what is she
ordering sugar she's ordering
sugar yeah I wonder if
sugar can make you crazy oh here's a St
high levels of glucose triglycerides
linked to psychiatric disorders new
study
says
so Starbucks which in my opinion is a
liquid candy store let me say that again
Starbucks for men is a place to get
coffee for women it's a liquid candy
store they're going for the
sugar if you stand there and watch who
walks in what they pick up and what they
walk out with it's
sugar now I'm I'm on a low sugar diet
because my blood you even at my weight
and you know eating a pretty clean diet
even I am a little bit high in sugar so
there's literally one item in all of
Starbucks I'm willing to eat that
doesn't have wheat in it because I want
to stay away from that there's only one
item just the egg bites basically
so so we have a Starbucks on every
Corner we have uh the liberal women
walking in there and picking up their
sugar going crazy listening to the news
and playing with their phones not being
able to get a date because the whole
dating situation and their meaning of
life has been
destroyed and then they go into politics
and they
vote this is not a sustainable
situation not sustainable
so we we just have to be a little bit
more honest about what's going on
Democrats are a party of women women are
eating too much sugar and they're going
crazy not just because of the sugar I
mean it's also the the phones the
situation the old family dating
situation complexity of Life
Etc now I have a second theory that I'm
going to break
out if something were driving all of
civilization
crazy whatever it is you know you you
can pick your favorite thing it's the
news it's their phones it's something
whatever it is where would you see it
first where where would a like if there
was a ray gun that made people crazy
where would you see it
first I think you'd see it in
children because they have the weakest
Minds uh and you'd see them going trans
and non-binary like crazy do we see that
yes
yes you see children having major
psychological problems changing their
genders trying anything literally trying
anything to try to you know solve what's
happening so you'd see it in children
and and definitely children are going
nuts secondly you would see it in women
before
men
why well do I even need to explain
that are can we finally get past the
point where I have to treat men and
women like they're the
same is there anybody listening who
needs me to do oh there's some reason
that they're exactly the same no you
don't need that right are haven't we
outgrown that yeah I I'm pretty sure
that women are let's say closer to their
emotional let's say their emotional life
is richer than men is that the best way
to say do women have a richer emotional
life than men
because that takes the takes the
Judgment out of it right because I think
you'd all agree with that that women
have a richer emotional life if you have
a ritual emotional life and I find out
about it and I'm a
hypnotist do you know how easy it is to
manipulate somebody with that rich
emotional life super easy easier than
somebody who's analytical that's for
sure you can also fool fool very smart
analytical people but that's a little
different different kind of
process yeah so if we're if we're being
subjected to some kind of anide force or
forces that are driving people crazy
every observation is supporting that
because the humans are falling in the
exact order that they would be
susceptible to outside manipulation of
their psychological
well-being it's all there it's right in
front of
you um let's see is there any other
evidence of that well Joe Rogan was
talking to Coleman Hughes and Coleman
Hughes had been on The View recently and
had a good little interaction with
them and it caused Joe Rogan to
characterize the view as the people on
The View as quote rabies infested Hen
House rabies infested Hen
House what would be another word for
that b crazy liberal woman yeah
so people are willing to say it out loud
now they're going to use their own
language but people are saying it out
loud the when you watch The View you
really don't get the feeling you're
seeing a difference of opinion you think
you're seeing mental
illness only that's all I say I I know
what a difference of opinion looks like
you know who has a difference of opinion
John
Stewart John Stewart now he's got you
know maybe a little TDS like everybody
but he's not insane he's not mentally
incompetent he's he doesn't have rabies
he he just has different information
different priorities you know little
team play but he's not
crazy right Bill Mah You can disagree
with him all day long but he doesn't
seem crazy you know he has a little TDS
but otherwise fairly normal
psychologically as far as we can tell
but there's definitely a difference when
you look at the view they actually
seem mentally unwell and if we can't
call out mental health and we have to
keep treating it like it's a difference
of opinion that's not going to work very
well yeah we we need to treat mental
health as a mental
problem you know if you want to respect
the people involved you treat them like
as a medical
problem well the bird flew maybe coming
at us I don't know somebody had sex with
a cow and a bird at the same time and
ate a hamburger I don't know the details
I may have made that up but somehow the
CDC is worrying that this bird flu can
spread among our dairy cattle but uh
Thomas Massie picking up the pattern
quickly um says the bureaucrats and
corporations will probably use this to
advance an agenda against raw milk
independent farmers and backyard
chickens let me give you some
advice never get a backyard
chicken never never get a backyard
chicken because you know what happens if
you have a backyard
chicken sooner or later one way or
another you're going to end up with a
backyard rooster do you know what
happens when you have a backyard rooster
well you don't sleep too well and your
neighbors are going to call the
authorities and then what do you do with
your rooster do you kill it well that's
not legal no because it's a pet you
can't kill your pet and they're
protected you cannot kill a male you
know a
rooster so well at least you can give it
away right you can find like somebody
wants to take
it nope there are zero places that will
take a rooster
can't give it away can't sell it can't
lose it can't kill
it but you might have to
move so if you get a rooster you're
going to have to sell your house your
your neighbors will make you
move don't get a chicken it's going to
lead to a rooster you're going to have
to move and none of that's a joke by the
way and it's
guaranteed that that that chain of
events that's guaranteed chicken rooster
gotta leave your house don't do it best
advice I'll ever give
you because I've seen it I I'm speaking
from Direct close
experience all right uh Tucker is
talking to uh Marjorie Taylor green and
she's not too keen on speaker Johnson
and him trying to get money to
Ukraine
and there was you know the speculation
that speaker Johnson is being
blackmailed by somebody
does he act like somebody who's being
blackmailed if you're just
observing and you see that the top
Republican is just gung-ho about Ukraine
support and you notice that
um he replaced Mitch McConnell who's
going to remain as a senator and Mitch
McConnell said his number one goal as he
remains a senator is funding
Ukraine so the ex speaker of the house
was in favor of it the new speaker of
the house is in favor of it but
Republicans by majority are not in favor
it now is that true the Republicans by a
majority are not in favor in the house
is that true right now I think that's
true so why would the
leaders be doing something that their
base does not favor by a
majority I'll need a fact check on that
I think it's not a
majority and the only reason I can think
of is that the uh our intelligence
people
um threaten them so I think they're
coerced I think McConnell um either has
some financial gain or he's being
blackmailed and I think that speaker
Johnson is probably just being
blackmailed I think he's being
blackmailed I think we have a blackmail
accuracy that our entire government is
some basically collection of blackmailed
people that the intelligence people can
control they they prer black mailable
people because that's how they control
them so that's what it looks like I
don't have any proof of that but I would
say observationally they look like uh
captives they they act like prisoners
basically if you act like a prisoner
long enough I'm going to think you're a
prisoner and these guys are acting like
prisoners they don't act like these are
their opinions at
all and I think uh Mitch MCC McConnell
calls it an isolationist movement to
give up on Ukraine is it is it an
isolationist movement or is it just a
bad
idea an
isolationist and of course uh CNN and
MSNBC have been telling us forever that
Ukraine is winning which is apparently
absurd and so why would the leaders of
the Republican party of all things want
to support all this money for
war
when they know it's not going to make a
difference what's going on the only
thing I can assume is it's exactly what
it looks like the industrial military
complex can make a lot of money out of
that 60 billion and they want their cut
and they have blackmail or bribery or
something on the leaders now if you've
got a republican like
MTG questioning whether the leader of
her own group is being being
blackmailed he has to step
down it doesn't matter if you can prove
it if you're acting in a way that your
own base can't tell if you've been
blackmailed or you're under
duress and you can't explain why you're
acting the way you're acting you know
without obvious I feel like
that loss of confidence should be enough
to get you out of the job you know the
appearance of being
blackmailed seems like that should be
enough you know to take somebody out of
that kind of a job anyway the French are
making noise about maybe sending troops
on the ground to
Ukraine so the Russian uh the Russia
Russia called the French defense
minister to say it will create problems
for France
itself I don't want to say what kind of
problems but France you might have some
problems that's ominous
so what do you think are the French
going to break the seal and then it will
be easier for America to add some troops
because at that point well it's just a
NATO action and we're part of NATO and
we got to Pro protect our French allies
so of course we're sending some advisers
just a few advisers no they we're just
going to do train them to use the
weapons well while they're there they
shot a few things well as long as we're
over there and everybody knows we're
over there and shooting we might as well
send some more people over there and
pretty soon the military-industrial
complex is making even more money than
before um more people are speaking out
about Israel's treatment of Gaza uh I
will remind you that my opinion of what
Israel is doing there is
irrelevant as is yours because they're
going to do what they're going to do now
there are a lot of cases where your
opinion actually could make a difference
I think in American politics you if you
press hard enough enough and complain
hard enough and enough people pick up
the same
complaint it probably makes a difference
but this is a really special case it's
it's a onever
situation you hope it's onever and uh
Israel's just going to do what they're
going to do and I think they're going to
burn their International
reputation but they've decided it's
worth the cost and I don't know that
they're wrong from a purely let's say
you know National interest point of view
are they wrong to to burn their
Holocaust Goodwill if you ironically if
you can call it that but it's they're
they're torching it the the whole
Holocaust thing is is gone I think it's
gone already imagine this
conversation Israeli says blah blah blah
Holocaust now where does the
conversation go after that every time
for the rest of Eternity um um
Gaza right G Gaza now erases the
Holocaust as an asset their greatest
asset it's gone but is it a good
investment I'm going to say again that
in 200 years if Israel essentially
controls Gaza and pacified it and maybe
made it economically successful it's
going to look like they made the right
decisions in the war at the moment it
never looks like a good decision does it
like nothing looks smart when you're the
bullets are flying everybody looks dumb
in that situation you're like really you
couldn't find any way to prevent
somebody from shooting at you for a year
there was nothing you could do to make
that not happen you know so we just
automatically think if the bullets are
flying probably both sides are being a
little up right a little bit like
every Situation's different but you just
automatically have that bias
so anyway Paul Graham had an interesting
comment about a situation that I don't
know if it's true at all because you
know everything out of the war zone is
is
fake but he he says that uh there's
some um evidence from some military
person who says it's true that uh the
Israelis preferred to wait for the Hamas
uh highlevel person to come home uh then
they would take out the whole home with
the family and the wife and that they
preferred doing it that
way I guess because they knew where it
was then you know they didn't have to
wonder if they were getting them now
that might have been one person and it's
the fog of
War i' I'd be surprised if that's the
official policy I wouldn't be surprised
if somebody's Commander told them to do
it I'd be a little surprised if it was
coming from the top but it's War do I
think that it is moral or ethical to
kill the entire family when you're just
going after the Hamas leader who is
married to them well it's war and I
don't believe in making moral and
ethical judgments during a war because
it's all bad like making some little uh
you know ranking of oh this is a little
bit worse than this other thing and no
it's just all bad like everything is
just bad both sides just all the time
all bad but um certainly self defense is
is the motivating factor here for
Israel so I'm going to ask I'm going to
ask the question a different
way and this this is just to make you
expand your thinking about it all right
so analogies are never the same as the
situation so I'm going to give you an
analogy just to expand your thinking but
analogies are not arguments so so I
don't win the argument with this I might
expand your thinking imagine there was a
situation where somebody kidnapped a
child um did surgery on him and put a
bomb inside their torso sewed him up and
then said all right kid your your
parents are here and maybe the real goal
is to you know blow up wherever the
parents work so here get out of the car
and run toward your parents now let's
say that our intelligence people had
learned in advance that the kid had a
bomb in it and as soon as he went
through the doorway the building would
blow up and the kid would be dead
would it be ethical and moral to shoot
the child before he reached the
door murder the innocent child to avoid
the further death ethical
moral well I'm gonna take a page n of uh
Dana Pino's
book she she she split the baby on TV
yesterday in a way that I thought was
clever totally
immoral which is you know separate from
the question of whether you need to do
it you know the the the question of
morality you you can allow yourself a
luxury belief so a luxury belief is one
you don't have to operate on it's like
somebody else's problem oh yeah killing
people totally immoral I'm totally
against it which I can say because
nobody slaughtered my people on October
7th pretty easy for me to say Wars
immoral but if you slaughtered my people
I might feel a little differently about
that so we want to be good people in
public so if anybody asks you what do
you think about you know the situation
you should say oh it's terrible it's a
terrible situation and it's all immoral
and unethical and I'm not going to
change my vote it's all immoral and
unethical well that's just sort of a
Dodge but I do like that it's a nod
toward you know maybe
an ideal that we should strive for that
we should try to be good
people but in the real world you got to
make decisions and if your terrorist is
commuting and commuting back to the
house do you call that self-defense if
you take out the whole
house
well I say it's not worth talking about
because I don't think this is unusual in
war to me the looks sort of ordinary
terrible but kind of ordinary meaning
that probably every war has this same
degree of things you wish didn't
happen and in the special case where the
children have been
weaponized
um it makes the self-defense argument
stronger right so here here's another
one same argument let's say there's a
home Invader at your home and it's is
somebody bigger than you I'll just use
me I'll use myself there's a home
Invader and they're definitely bigger
than me and but I get lucky we get in a
scuffle and the home Invader trips over
the rug and I jump on top of him and I
you managed to be able to hold them down
now uh and let's say the home invader's
knife came free and I'm now on sitting
on the back of the home Invader and I've
got my knife in my hand but there's some
subdued so I can't legally kill them
right you all agree I can't kill them
because they're
subdued and now the person who's subdued
says all right you're in trouble now if
you don't kill me and you let me get up
I'm going to kill you and you know you
only got lucky the first time because
it's somebody bigger than you and you
know if you let them up and you don't
have your phone with you so you can't
call out you can't call out to anybody
if you let them up they're going to kill
you is it self-defense if you finish
them
off I actually don't know the answer to
that if you finish them off because it's
the only way you can stay
alive is that self-defense and I think
the law would say it's not
self-defense I think they would call it
murder do you know what I would call
it
necessary I would call it necessary in
my also be
murder but that doesn't change it being
necessary so yes I would stab them to
death and then I would call the police
in that
order every time so if you say to me
there's a house full of people who are
going to grow up to be terrorists if you
kill their
dad do I have a legal ethical right to
kill them
too no I
don't I don't don't it's not moral and
it's not ethical it might be
necessary it might be necessary but it's
not moral it's not
ethical so war is about the uh what is
necessary it is not about moral or
ethical we just wish it we wish it were
it
isn't all right
um and then CNN had some analysts who
said that the is Israeli military has
told them to basically just shoot every
man of fighting
age do you think that's true do you
think that the official rules of
engagement are to shoot everybody of
military
age I don't
know you know it could be one one
Commander maybe could be more than that
could be this person's lying no no it's
on CNN so it could just be a
lie but is it necessary to shoot every
man of fighting age I don't
know I don't
know um I know that if you didn't a lot
more of you would
die that I know there would be more
Israeli soldiers would die if they
didn't so does that make it appropriate
because it's
self-defense they're killing him just in
case is that
self-defense I don't know I actually
don't know um but I'm not going to
defend Israel I'm just going to say in a
war this is exactly what
happens there are no good guys in
Wars there are no good guys in Wars
there's just what's necessary and then
there are people who are on your side
and that's about it so if Israel is
doing what is necessary and they're
still our allies then that's my
conclusion it's necessary they're allies
if he ask me is it moral and ethical
no nope isas moral and ethical nah is
the Biden Administration nah no are the
people who want it to stop moral and
ethical they might be they might also be
stupid so I I can separate those things
pretty easily all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all I've got for you
