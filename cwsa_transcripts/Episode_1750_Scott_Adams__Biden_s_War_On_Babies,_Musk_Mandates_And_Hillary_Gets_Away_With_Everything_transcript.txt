good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
scott adams and i think we'd all agree
that nothing has ever been better and if
you'd like to take it up to a
stratospheric
multi-dimensional level
and i know you're you're the kind of
people who do that
am i right
do you settle for ordinary no
you wouldn't be here if you did and all
you need is a copper mug or a glass on
tanker tell us a stinky canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now if you will
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine hit of the day with a hint of
oxytocin it's called the simultaneous
sip and wow is it gonna just set you
free today go
perfection
i'll tell you when you've been drinking
crappy hotel coffee for a week
the good stuff
really tastes good am i right
how many of you have heard of the uh
the coat hanger test that's going around
tick tock has anybody heard of that
heard about it for the first time today
no it's not about abortion
stop it stop it
no there's a little test which
apparently is based on science in which
you take a
a co-hanger that can stretch so it'd
have to be the kind that stretches
and you stretch the wide part and you
put it on your head
and then once it's on your head it
causes you
to involuntarily turn to one side
people don't believe it's real they'll
put it on their head and as soon as they
put it on their head we'll go
and they'll be like what
so i was planning to do the
uh challenge for you live
but i thought to myself i think i'd
better test this before i do it on live
although it'd be funny or if it failed
live
so i found myself the only
the only co-hanger i could find that
would bend in this house because i have
mostly wooden
ones and i stretched it and i put it on
my head
and now i'm told that 98 of people
will experience this head turn
but apparently i'm in the top two
percent again
or the bottom two percent depending on
your perspective because i didn't feel
anything and then i thought
is this a prank
this isn't even real is it
i don't know it sounded like a prank
because
am i in the two percent
i mean did somebody actually get me to
put a co-hanger on my head
i feel like i got pranked but if
anybody's tried it let me know i might
try a different cohanger just to find
out
i heard an argument
that was a good counter to my argument
and you like it when i'm wrong don't you
or at least you like it when i point out
that there's an argument that's better
than my argument now i don't know if
it's better
but i had not heard it before
and it had to do with my argument
that logically
if we knew that the amount of initial
viral load made a difference to your
outcomes
that masks would at least work that well
even if everybody got infected
some people would get less of a you know
severe outcome because maybe the mask
prevented some of the load from going in
your face
well anatoly lubarski had a counter to
that argument which i don't know if it's
right
but i consider it well worthy enough to
repeat right so this is attacking my own
argument everybody ready for this
i will now dismantle my own argument it
goes like this
if it's true that the amount of initial
virus makes a big difference to outcomes
we probably would have seen it in the
data right so this is the first question
and i don't think we did
so at the macro level it doesn't look
like there's any big difference you know
if there's a difference
maybe somebody's teasing it out with
statistics but it's not big enough
to warrant the mandates in my opinion
because it didn't look like it made a
difference at any macro level
but
i still argued
that logically it had to make a
difference if we knew this fact
if we knew
that the initial dose
made a difference
and then anatoly adds this argument
he says that the viruses
essentially replicate in a logarithmic
way
really really quickly
such that the difference of uh
you know a few hours or something
over a few hours you would end up being
at maximum virus no matter what so that
the the amount of difference between
getting a small virus and then it
instantly replicates to a huge level
versus getting a larger dose in the
first place
and then it also replicates to its
highest level there's not much
difference in timing
how about that
now
i would say that's at least
worthy of putting on
that's at least equal to my
hypothesis it's at least equal
hey alexa cancel
i hate it when my devices wake up and
start talking to me
how about that
would would you accept that as a
reasonable debunk
of my opinion which i've held for now
two years
reasonable or no
it's reasonable enough
to make me rethink my position
that's all
i definitely would rethink it
but we'll see
all right a little update on the amber
turd trial i saw somebody call her
scamper
scammer turd
that's maybe an upgrade i don't know
but apparently her own witnesses uh
haven't been so good for her
and it looks like
she has proven that she was the abuser
so if you look at the social media
social media seems to have decided that
amber heard was the abuser
what do you think of that
now that doesn't mean the trial will go
that way but social media seems to have
decided
that she's the abuser
now let me tell you something
about her alleged
personality type she's in that
cluster too or a category two whatever
it is personality according to
one expert testimony
if you're in that cluster b
category what is one thing you can know
about them for sure
now you don't know if they did a
specific crime but what is one thing you
can know about yeah that's right
not only do they lie
here's the key
not only do they lie
they lie about everything
see that's the thing people don't get
if i told you oh amber heard as a
personality type where she would be a
liar
you say to yourself well but she's going
to save that
she'll save that lie for the important
stuff right she's not going to lie about
just everything all the time
nope nope
that personality type lies about
everything all the time
to the point where it's unbelievable
it's like you can't even believe it
it doesn't even when there's no purpose
to it there's no point to it there's
nothing gained
just
wall-to-wall lying about everything
now what happens when you take somebody
who's a wall-to-wall liar
and they can't stop
they literally can't stop
that's what the personality type is they
can't stop lying
and then you put them on trial
and you put them under oath
and then you have people who are
witnesses to the various things come on
what's going to happen
well what's going to happen is what
happened to amber hurd
amber turned
uh
so there were claims such as
you know one day he broke her nose
and then the defense for for or whatever
it is the attorney for uh johnny depp
shows a photo of her on the red carpet
the next day looking perfect
and her claim is that
he broke her nose
and then there was one other
example where it was just as equally
obvious that she lied
and
i think johnny depp is going to win
i think he's going to win i don't know
so we'll
see but i feel like there's something
important happening here because people
are learning for the first time that
that such people exist
how many of you
have said to yourself oh my god i know
somebody who's married to an amber herd
or maybe you were
how many of you said oh my god i know
her and i had some yeah look at that
my sister's a herd
yes right
it is it is a personality type of which
there are so many of them
and the problem is that you imagine
they're normal
and they're not
the people in this personality type are
closer to monsters with human dna than
they are with like just people
because they're there to destroy
the average person is there to help out
that's our most natural impulse
is you put us in the situation and we'll
be like oh how can i help i'll help the
tribe help the family we're basically a
helpful species
but the
that cluster b types
are super selfish
so selfish that you can't even
you know imagine like selfish on a scale
that's mind-boggling
and now you know that they're real
and there are lots of them
all right
uh richard grinnell
who is tweeting about the pennsylvania
vote which apparently is still not
completed
and he said uh so this is the
um
dr oz thing right so they're still
counting votes and he tweets uh
pennsylvania voting is totally broken it
doesn't take this long to count
why are people so silent about this
isn't it because we've been too beaten
up about it
is that why or is it because social
media is
censoring it in some way we don't know
but i i did my usual tweet
whenever i see anything about the
election
integrity
uh i i say something like this reminder
so i retweeted richard grinnell's tweet
as a reminder every previously trusted
institution in america has been proven
corrupt
except for all 50 states running
independent election systems in
different ways with different people
those are fine
so stop asking questions
really
really
yeah so
if you really want to uh mock
reality
try agreeing with it
but agreeing with it really hard because
that's what i just did yes it's true
every institution has been proven
corrupt except for all 50 states run by
different people in different ways
they all nailed it but wow
pretty big coincidence isn't it
yeah try saying that to somebody who is
absolutely positive the election was
appropriate
just say what i said and watch their
reaction
do you know what they can say to that as
a counter to that
allow me to give you uh a play in one
act
this would be me at a
party in which we imagine i drink
cocktails which i don't here i am with
my imaginary cocktail
a person says to me uh that election was
fine there's been a 2020 election was
fine there were no problems to which i
say
yeah yeah there were no problems and
that's really
incredible
and we should be so lucky because every
single institution in america has been
shown to be corrupt in the last few
years from our intelligence agencies to
congress to the medical and scientific
community really every single
entity
has been shown to be corrupt and even
the democrats it looks like they ran a
giant russia collusion hoax and they
worked with the media so yeah every
single entity
from congress to the media through
science to the fbi and the
intel agencies 100 of them are corrupt
and we know that that's beyond question
at this point but
you're right bob
all
50 states run independently by their own
their own systems very complicated but
all 50 states
got it right
and bob
may i toast to you for your perception
your common sense approach to this
and your uh
i'd say your patriotism
bob this is to you for correctly
pointing out that everything is broken
except all 50 states which are operating
great here's to you bob
now i'd like to do bob's reaction
now i'm bob
so uh
so you're a big trump supporter huh
no that's that's really that's a little
off point um you know maybe
there's some truth to that but that's
really not on point
so you favor the drinking bleach guys
while you're saying
no no that was a hoax that was a hoax
now what i'm saying is
independent of who was running
is a comment about just the election
system
so
good luck with supporting
the nazi good luck i better fill my
drink goodbye
and see
that's every conversation in america
if you use my technique
all right
the
biden administration has decided to
boost the carbon
removal
industry which is nascent
i have never used that word before in
public
it's nascent
go look it up if you need to but most of
you don't need to
um these big carbon sucking machines
you're gonna put three five 3.5 billion
toward boosting the industry
to suck the co2 out of the air
to solve climate change
there are three bad takes
if you had any one of these reactions
i might be mocking you for being an npc
here are the three bad takes to the
story number one
it's called trees
it's called trees
yes trees do remove carbon
dioxide
however i'm going to point out that if
trees would do it well enough
we'd be using trees instead of big giant
sucking machines
because the scientists who decided that
maybe we needed big giant sucking
machines they've heard of trees
they've heard of trees
i know it's weird but scientists
have heard of trees
so they probably calculated
the impact of trees before they made
their decision to do it a different way
bad take number two
that's not gonna work
that's not gonna work
come on how's that going to work that's
never going to work
it's not efficient enough
to which i say
that's why you're testing it
it's 345 billion dollars to boost it
but primarily to make sure you're doing
it right
right
how do you know it doesn't work until
you try it
it's sort of like those wright brothers
those bicycle makers they'll never make
out lighter than air
aircraft
well why don't you let them test it
maybe they might surprise you i'm not
saying this stuff will work
how the hell would i know
i'm saying that if you can test it
at a reasonable cost relative to you
know the problem you're trying to solve
test it
so if you're saying that it won't work
well
you might be an npc
because you don't have to ask will it
work
just say
can we test it
at a reasonable price and apparently we
can
so we'll find out if it works and we'll
find out if it can be the technology can
be improved to the point where it's cost
efficient efficient we're not there yet
and then the third bad take is
co2 is plant food with lots of o's for
food
don't you know that co2 is plant food
yes
yes i do know that
guess who else knows that
i'm just i'm not sure
scientists
scientists have heard of trees
scientists
have heard of co2 being used in
greenhouses to boost production they've
heard of it i know i know
so i'm thinking they've
factored that into their decision-making
what happens if these machines are too
good and they suck all the co2 out of
the air and then the plants will all die
because they need some co2
well i feel like we would pull back
before that happened
i don't know
call me an optimist
but if we saw that our co2 struck
sucking machines were destroying the uh
food supply on earth which would be sort
of obvious
uh i feel like we'd pull back
if you think we just keep on going
well
i don't know what to say to that
all right those are your bad takes
so elon musk continues to be the most
interesting thing person in the world so
he announced on twitter that tesla is
building a hardcore he calls it hardcore
litigation department where we directly
initiate and execute lawsuits
the team will report directly to me now
this is just a wonderful brush back
pitch
because you know he's going to be
attacked with all manner of accusations
the accusation yesterday that
he
exposed himself to
a massage therapist on his private plane
which by the way
if you're going to be accused of a crime
and you got to choose
i would choose that one
i would like to be accused of exposing
myself
to my personal massage therapist
on my private jet
if i can get that going
that'd be like
now i'm not saying that that's
you know excusable
if in fact he did something
inappropriate well
then i don't i don't support that at all
i'm just saying
that if he had to be accused of
something
well that's the one i'd pick
i'm pretty sure i'd pick that one like
out of all the things you could be
accused of yeah i'd take that one thank
you
but
to me this looks like elon musk
negotiating in public in this case
i use negotiating loosely
to mean he is warning people that if
they come after him it's going to be
really expensive
and by the way
he's the richest person in the world
so if you'd like to come after somebody
with a strategy a legal strategy
he's basically telling you that
at this point he's going to destroy you
he didn't say it directly
but if you've got uh this hardcore
litigation team that's going to be
aggressively going after things and
reporting directly to musk
yeah he's going to make it expensive to
mess with him
so i like the fact that he put it out
there as a
you know a sort of a self-defense thing
speaking of climate change bjorn lomborg
who you know as
uh one of the most rational
uh evaluators of climate change and
other
issues and he was looking at the
adequacy of batteries
if we had a world that was powered by
solar and
wind
now we know that you need battery backup
for those because they're not continuous
sources
wind and solar is not so he gives this
estimate and i would love to know if
elon musk agrees with this estimate
he says europe uses and he gives some
statistics of how much energy the g they
use
so they have enough battery storage now
for
uh one minute and 21 seconds
so all of europe's battery backup
if they use it all will give them
another you know little under two
minutes of power
all of it
um
by the year 2030
that number should go way up yes it is
up to almost 12 minutes
in 2030
we might be able to get the amount of
battery back up to almost 12 minutes of
the whole day
now
isn't this the part where elon musk
needs to explain to us how we can get
enough
battery backup because he makes a good
argument musk does
that you need just a tiny corner of the
united states with solar panels
you know so much so tiny that i don't
even know if you'd notice it from um
from the space station right if you were
looking down on it i don't know if it
would be big enough
even to see it from space like but it
would power the whole united states
and he you know musk gives his
description of how big that space would
be now of course
that's conceptual
because you can't put all your power
source in one place the grid couldn't
handle it but suppose you you know
distributed that around
uh but i don't i've never seen him
address
how much battery backup you need have
has anybody seen that
send me a link to it if you have any if
you have any uh recent
statements where he mentioned whether
you could get enough battery backup
wait a minute do you need battery backup
if your grid was sufficient
let me ask you this
if you had your solar powers spread
around the country
and then you connected your grid so that
any grid that needs power can get it
from anywhere else in the country that
may be impossible i don't know so that's
the part
that's the part i need you to tell me if
it's possible
because the longer you send the
electricity the more it gets degraded
right there's less of it by the time it
gets there so there are some practical
limits about sending electricity long
distances
right
but could you put enough um enough
panels
in enough parts of the country
that no matter which ones were dark
there would still be enough light in the
other part of the country or wind
because most
i guess you'd have to go global because
the country's dark at the same time so
that doesn't work
but
you could take care of cloudy days
you know at least cloudy days you can
take care of
so i don't know if the grid can solve
any of this or it just needs to be
batteries i have a suspicion that has to
be batteries
all right
uh
bill barr was talking about the
trans
trend
and i didn't know this but apparently
the
percentage of trans people in the
general population seems to be doubling
every generation
as as bill maher pointed out
now it probably doesn't actually double
does it
maybe we're just learning of it maybe
there were more people than we ever
imagined and doubling it up to you know
two percent
could be just a statistical aberration
but apparently it's up to like 20 or
something in some places
20 trans children like in l.a
if
you're saying that if you go to a dinner
party in la you know several people will
be talking about their trans children
several
you know just statistically it can't
possibly be true
the implication here is that it's more
socially driven than biological
what do you think
do you think that people could be
socially driven
to question their actual gender
identity and then change it
do you think that social
pressure is enough to make people change
their
gender
identity
yes yes this
is plenty
yeah the answer is unambiguously totally
yes
it just wouldn't affect everybody
right persuasion
is like that
persuasion doesn't
work on everybody doesn't work all the
time
it's a statistical thing so yes if you
have a society that's
promoting anything
or or at least
removing the disincentive to anything
you get more of it you get more of it
right so i think society is largely
driving it now
suppose it's true
i don't know it's true but suppose it's
true
the society is driving a number of
people who would not have made the
decisions they made otherwise
in a different time and with a different
social situation it just wouldn't have
happened
now is that good or bad
because here's the thing
if you're
promoting and you know really let's say
welcoming of any trans situation
do you not guarantee you'll get too much
of it
too much of it meaning people who really
maybe shouldn't have made the decision
make the decision
but it could go the other way right
the other way if it was totally
suppressed
and discouraged
there are probably a number of people
who would have been better off with the
transition
and then wouldn't do it
so who do you make the losers
do you make the because you have to pick
a winner and you have to pick a loser
do you just go by numbers
and say okay which one has the greatest
number of unhappy people
i don't know
or do you say
do no harm
and it's worse to
or injure somebody
than it is to not help somebody
i don't know is that a reasonable
standard um based on what why would you
say that's reasonable
and
so i always separate the two questions
question number one is it a good idea
the way we're messaging and handling the
trans situation
is it a good idea to do it that way
and then secondly
you know is is trans a real thing with
real people making real decisions or is
it all psychological or whatever so i i
say let people make their own decisions
knowing that many of them will destroy
their lives
like everything else
i love i let people make their own
decision to own a motorcycle
how many people will uh you know dump
their motorcycle at one point or another
while they own it
if you buy a motorcycle is it are you
gonna go down
does anybody own a motorcycle
people who own a motorcycle answer this
question if you own a motorcycle are you
going to lay it down
are you going to lay down your
motorcycle if you own one
yes
yes
you buy a motorcycle knowing you're
gonna you're gonna lay it down meaning
at some point you could have a situation
with it
right
and nobody buys a motorcycle and says
i'm not gonna wreck this thing
if you do you're not really being
rational about it
buying a motorcycle means buying a wreck
you're going to be in one
you're going to lay it down
all right at some point another
you're going to be laying by the side of
the road and your motorcycle is going to
be sideways right
anybody who owns a motorcycle can
confirm this you buy a motorcycle with
the knowledge you bought yourself an
accident
you just hope you don't die that's it
same with a bicycle
who buys a bicycle saying i won't fall
off my bicycle nobody
nobody
you're falling off your bicycle
that's gonna happen
right
so
uh i don't like analogies because
they're they're always too imperfect but
getting you to the way of thinking
only you know just let that analogy go
we don't need to defend it i'm just
saying that lots of people will make
personal choices about you know
transitioning
that you and i would not make
and sometimes we would have made the
right decision and sometimes we wouldn't
because we don't really know
because unfortunately it's one of those
things you don't really know if you're
going to be happier
you just got to guess
so this is a case where if i were the
emperor and i was i were in charge of
everybody's life
i'd probably slow down this
transitioning stuff
i'm sure i would make it illegal
before a certain age
do i am i going to be cancelled by
social media because we treat everything
else like that right
anything that's a big permanent decision
kind of thing we say you have to be a
certain age to do it
now medical stuff
medical stuff
parents do get to decide
so it's not really the kid deciding in
the first place ultimately because they
can't make that decision
so i'm not sure that a parent should
make a decision for a kid about
transitioning
i can say that it's always a decision
whether you decide to do it or not do it
it's still a decision
but i think the decision to wait
and let the kid make their own decision
when they let's say when they turn 18.
that just makes more sense
to me now is that
is that anti-trans to say that the trans
people should make adult decisions
instead of child decisions
i don't know
is that
is that taking it too far
i don't know you know i try to be the
you know the
most aggressive defender of anybody
who's in a
anybody who's in
a situation where they're a minority
basically
i like to aggressively defend them all
it's just a better world that way
um
so i hope well anyway i hope the best
for the trans community
in all cases
um
if i had to guess i would say that the
transitioning among kids is 80 social
am i wrong i don't know
might be
maybe it might be 80 biological
but it feels
without the benefit of any science
based on everything i know about
everything and the trends and
i'd say 80 percent
is a social pressure
and maybe 20 percent is biological
but again
that's not good enough to ban it
or to say that you can't do it
so
you know i i do generally want parents
to have the final say on medical stuff
but i don't even think they should have
a say in this case
because because they're really making a
decision for an adult who hasn't arrived
yet
right the kid
um
so did you see that did i talk about
this that elon musk called out the uh
clinton campaign he tweeted this
he said uh bet most people still don't
know that a clinton campaign lawyer
using campaign funds
created an elaborate hoax about trump
and russia
makes you wonder what else is fake he
says
now he's called out the
bleach drinking hoax as fake
he's called out the russia collusion
thing as fake including
the knowledge certain that a clinton
campaign lawyer was behind it or the
major part of it
makes you wonder what else is fake
he hasn't gotten to charlottesville yet
but i feel he's circling it
that might be that might be too much of
a third rail even for uh musk
that would certainly be pushing the
risk-taking there
but it's the biggest remaining hoax it's
the tent pole hoax yes it is the tent
pole hoax the one that supports all the
rest
we'll see
um
and you also the elon musk tweeted about
his wiener
i didn't realize that he was talking to
the
one of the
co-creators or creators of youtube
somebody named chad hurley
and
tesla
you know and that chad was asking him to
hurry up and close his twitter deal
and uh
tesla responded fine if you touch my
wiener you can have a horse
if you touch my wiener you can have a
horse
you can't tweet better than that
all right i told you i watched dinesh
d'souza's movie 2000 mules to give you
an opinion
and that there were some pushback on it
and the pushback i thought was
reasonable
reasonable pushback but you have to also
wait for his reasonable pushback to the
pushback
the first
criticism of the movie was that using
geo tracking
to push somebody in the vicinity of a
dropbox for ballots
doesn't mean they put ballots in the box
maybe it means that's where their
starbucks is
and they go to that location repeatedly
and it's just next to a box right
reasonable
but then dinesh says
uh that's why we eliminated
everybody who didn't go to 10 different
drop boxes
okay if you were if one person was in
the vicinity of 10 different drop boxes
that's that's a pretty good argument
because there aren't 10 starbucks next
to 10 drop boxes statistically
impossible
so i think that dinesh makes a
completely solid argument
that the geo tracking for this purpose
is good enough
it's accurate enough
because they eliminated all the data
from somebody who didn't go to 10
dropboxes if this data were people who
went to
at least one or two drop boxes
then you could say to yourself but
that's just the normal flow of people
there's always going to be one person
walking by a dropbox
but he didn't do that
it was like when does one person
go to 10 different drop boxes because
they're it's not like they're evenly
distributed
so this is statistical likelihood of one
person
being within a few feet of 10 different
drop boxes on let's say a short period
of time
pretty close to zero that that's an
accident
so i would say that dinesh's response to
that
is the winning
argument
it's stronger than the criticism
number two
um
criticized for not showing videos
of the one person doing those multiple
dropbox
there are videos of one person doing it
once
but he hasn't produced the one person
doing it multiple times which would
really be the you know that would be the
hammer on the case
he says
that they're working on
and the reason that they didn't is
because the
um you know in many cases the video
doesn't exist because there's no video
surveillance of that box
in many cases it's so poor
that you can't make out if it's the same
person
but
if the video has a time
signature as does the
geo tracking
you presumably and i think this is what
he said he was doing but i'm not 100
sure i think he's looking to sync up
the exact time of the video with the
exact time of the geo tracking
to make sure that the person putting it
in the box
is probably
the person
the same person
now if he can come up with that and even
if those videos are grainy
if if it looks like it could be that
person and the the geo tracking says
this
i would buy that argument
that would be pretty
pretty solid proof but
you haven't seen it yet have you
unless you see that the criticism is
stronger than the argument
that's where i'm at today
my my current view
is that until you have at least one
video showing somebody doing it to ten
boxes with you know some confirmation
without that
the criticism is still a little bit
stronger than the movie is
i will put the criticism as stronger
than the claim
for now
but remember dinesh says he can produce
this
now the other criticism is show us the
data
you've told us the result but you know
we need to see the data how's that
criticism
very good
it's good
so until you have access to the data and
other people say oh it does say this
and until you can see one video
ideally you'd want more than one
of somebody who's clearly
doing this activity
i would say the
the criticisms
are slightly stronger than the movie
right now
but wait
hold your hold your opinion
because the nest says he can produce
exactly what you're asking for
now if he produces that
i would say that then the movie is
stronger than the criticism
is that fair
is that a fair analysis
that if he produces an answer to these
criticisms
probably then the movie is going to be
stronger than the criticisms and that
i would get
there at that point
right
somebody says not fair but most of you
said that's fair so we'll we'll wait and
see we're gonna give dinesh his full
uh his full uh
you know opportunity to make the case
all right um
kyle bass who's a big china critic um
as big as i am
so he's very well known for criticizing
china
says china is preparing for war
oh
uh let me read his tweet see if you are
convinced
so kyle best says china is preparing for
war first she orders chinese banks to
risk assess and insulate against
potential u.s action sanctions
now she is directing chinese nationals
overseas to divest of any assets
china has been hoarding grain for over a
year
the playbook is uh the she's playbook is
obvious to anyone willing to connect the
dots in january 2020 china updated their
quote foreign investment law
which gives beijing the power and
ability to nationalize foreign assets
and investments under special
circumstances which would include war
in mid-2021 kyle bass says china's new
counter foreign sanctions law enables
beijing to seize corporate assets and
detain expat employees if the underlying
corporation simply is complying with
foreign sanctions
that's a pretty big deal if you're even
complying with sanctions china can close
you down
and then kyle bass says the groundwork
is being laid for a complete seizure of
foreign assets and investment in china
if you're an institutional fiduciary or
any other fiduciary you better rethink
your risk assessment of investing in
public or private chinese companies
and then he points out investors lost
everything in russia and have tried to
sweep it under the rug they won't be
able to hide the hundreds of billions
that will be lost in chinese investments
now knowing that kyle bass is as big a
critic of china as i am
do you uh
think this is china preparing for war
i think yes
but preparing for war is different than
planning for war
it looks like they're doing things which
just would make sense
because they're watching what's
happening in the world and they're
saying oh
this this could
come at us so i think what they're doing
is just mutually assured destruction and
protecting their situation so it looks
like just protection
but it is nonetheless true that they're
preparing for war
because war would be the primary reason
that any of this would be
activated
um
all right
so keep an eye on that
uh
the war on ukraine has been reduced to
minor headlines now and the minor
headline was russia claims total control
of mario pole
now there's not much left of mario pole
is there
so i mean they own a city that's
destroyed
uh but here's the other thing can they
hold it
isn't it my understanding that their
russia has a
a good attacking military
but they're
holding ground the military is sort of
lacking and they're not even staffed for
it so i wonder if
i wonder if conquering me even means
anything
because it's i know it's in major port
so it's strategically important but can
they hold it
i feel like
you know they're going to be sitting
ducks because if the russians hold it
the targets would be kind of obvious
and it seems like the ukrainian
resistance or whatever would just be
able to just hammer the russians
while they're trying to hold maripo
imagine imagine being the russian
occupying force in mariopol
every time you went outdoors
there would be a drone there
there would be a drone on your ass every
time you walked outdoors
if you tried to get together the drones
would bomb the building
so if you were if you're trying to hold
mario pole and you're a russian
military
you're going to be after looking up
you better look in the sky every day
every time you walk outside because
there's going to be a drone up there
looking to kill you
all right so there's uh rumor that the
roe vs wade decision is coming as early
as monday and the whole hell will break
loose and
by the administration is preparing for
uh some kind of uh
violence
from their own team i guess from the
left
now
how many of you think that the final
decision will equal the leaked version
how many think the real decision will be
basically the leaked version you know
give or take some minor edits
mostly yes
or close to it probably
probably
probably
but i remind you that my
one of my worst predictions was that
the original leak was fake
but i included in fake
it could be an early draft that doesn't
represent the final decision
so i'm going to stick with my decision
or not decision but my prediction which
has already been debunked
this will be the second time i've done
that
the first time was when kamal harris got
kicked down the primaries
and i stayed with my decision that she
would be president
which turned out to be weirdly sort of
right while being wrong
i think
there's a non-zero chance that the
decision won't be what you saw
what do you think
is there non-zero
i think it's low
if i were to put my money on i would bet
that that decision ends up being just
what you saw
you know some version of it
i think it's low
five percent maybe
that that and remember
part of why it might have been leaked is
to judge public reaction
and if you think that the supreme court
doesn't respond to
you know the public's emotions well then
you're wrong
you're wrong
they do make law based on public
emotions
they just argue it in legal terms but
basically
they're very sensitive to the
the will of the people just indirectly
uh you're sick of scott being so cocky
about ukraine
what part is cocky
what would be my cocky i just want to
see what
what what did i say this cocky about
ukraine i literally
said that it was one of my worst
predictions i say it over and over again
they're going to keep it
all right well i guess that sounds like
maybe there's a problem on your side
because
being cocky and confessing that you're
wrong about it seems somewhat opposite
that's a weird comment
all right
yeah i'm less of a true optimist than i
used to be
you get beaten down after a while
anyway it looks like ukraine will remain
a country
yeah at this point how many of you would
say that that's a statement they're
going to lose territory probably but how
many of you believe that ukraine will
now remain a sovereign country
pretty much all of you right
and
uh
you'll regret openly calling for the
killing of russia
what
you will regret openly calling for the
killing of russia did i do that
did anybody see me openly calling for
the killing of russia
when did that happen
have you ever noticed that almost all of
my critics are criticizing some
imaginary thing
it's just the weirdest thing i i almost
never
it's a rarely if ever i can't even
remember the last time i was criticized
for something i actually did
because when i'm criticized for things i
actually do
such as my incorrect prediction about
the invasion
i i embrace it completely yeah that was
totally wrong
all right yeah putin versus russia
it's a different it's a different
calculation
um
anyway we'll see if roe v versus way it
looks like what we thought it would be
um
what else is going on here
so
listening to uh i guess the
the ongoing investigation
into what happened with 2020 and the
russia collusion thing so this is
jonathan turley's take um talking about
the alpha bank story so it was a fake
story
that was trying to be pushed by the
clinton
campaign lawyer i guess
and charlie says this alpha bank story
was pushed by jake sullivan now the
national security adviser and by clinton
herself
but the thing to keep in mind is that
president obama was briefed when he was
president
that hillary clinton was planning to
make a russia collusion claim against
donald trump
to try to sort
of get out of her own email issues
during the campaign
and we now have someone saying
quote yes she green lighted the alpha
bank claim
which were completely without foundation
so
obama knew about this
now we assumed or we suspected he did
right but now we have confirmation don't
we
we have confidence at least according to
jonathan turley's interpretation
confirmation that uh
obama was briefed that there would be
like an illegal
well not illegal i guess but an
illegitimate claim
and he apparently was okay with it
because he let it happen
uh
i would say that makes that puts obama
in the uh most disgraced president list
i think you'd have to throw a bomb in
there with nixon at this point
wouldn't you
what would really be the difference
between what nixon did and what obama
did if this is true
if he if he was okay
with hillary clinton clinton
trying to
affect an election with a fake story
about russian collusion
if if this is true then he's just
richard nixon and forever
am i right
now keep in mind i want to i want to be
clear
i supported obama
for president
i thought it was a good move
and i actually there's some things he
did that i thought were pretty solid
but if this is true
if this is true
 forever
you don't this you don't get over this
now the other thing that he did that i
suggested he should be impeached for
was remember when he said that he
wouldn't touch
marijuana dispensaries
and then he got elected and then he went
after marijuana at dispensaries in my
state
to which i said okay well what's your
reason
why did you change your mind
and he never gave a reason
never to this day he's never given a
reason
what's it mean when you don't give a
reason
it means you're corrupt
it means you can't give a reason it
means somebody bought you
right so i said that obama should have
been impeached for not giving a reason
it's one thing to say i'm going to put
you people from your state in jail and
here are my reasons and i'd say oh i
like that or i don't like it but at
least you showed your work
and then i could at least trust the
system
but
you can't trust the system
if he did this
all right i mean you can't trust obama
at all so i would say this is the most
disgraceful thing i have
ever seen the president do
trying to think of something worse than
this
if obama knew about this and was okay
with it
and to this day he's not outing them for
doing it if that if that really happened
he's our worst president
there would be nothing that
trump did that would be on this level
let me put it in the cleanest terms if
you accept that this is true and the
evidence is pretty good at this point
that obama was okay with the russia
collusion hoax
being perpetrated
there's nothing that trump ever did that
was that bad
what do you say
name one thing that trump did that was
this bad
because if you do yeah the only people
who could do it would be
democrats who thought that something
that was a hoax was real
they're going to say well you know the
certainly the charlottesville fine
people statement was worse but it didn't
happen
that was a hoax
or well he's told us to drink bleach and
no that didn't happen didn't happen that
was a hoax
well you know called the country
 countries now no that was taken
out of context and so there's literally
nothing that trump has ever been
confirmed to have done
like this level of confirmation
that would rise to this level
i can't think of anything
um
you think carter was obama was the worst
yeah
woodrow wilson jailing critics okay that
would be pretty bad
but i think that the
russia collusion thing could have jailed
critics if it worked out
so that i'd say that's worse
so hillary clinton worst person in the
world obama number two that's my final
vote
george washington was the worst he had
slaves
yeah i guess if you're a slave owner
technically you're worse
i will accept that reframe
all right just looking at your comments
for a moment
all right i think we've done it i
believe i have achieved my objective of
the best live stream in the history of
civilization and before you argue with
me i think i'll shut down the live
stream over here on youtube
you know it's true it's true
bye for now
