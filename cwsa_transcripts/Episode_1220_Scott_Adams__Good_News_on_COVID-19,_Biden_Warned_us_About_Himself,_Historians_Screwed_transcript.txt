you know it just occurred to me
that when i was a kid it would have been
hard to do this even if we had this
technology
because all of our clocks were different
when i was a kid most of our clocks were
on
slightly different times so if
you wanted to live stream when i was a
kid
even if you could do the live stream
part
you wouldn't be able to do the starting
simultaneous part
because people would be like i don't
know my watch says
you're five minutes early and half the
other people would be
it looks like you're about 10 minutes
late according to me
but thanks to the miracle of technology
every one of you
has the correct time and here you are
so glad you're here and if you'd like to
enjoy it to its fullest extent
you know what you need it's a copper mug
glass or a glass a tanker chelsea's die
in a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better yeah it's called the
simultaneous sip
and i hope you sipped when i did i
forgot to say go
but uh if you did savor it
savor it okay
you gotta stop and smell the coffee
sometimes
well have you all heard that yeah
periscope is going to be discontinued
but fear not i will not be discontinued
i will not be canceled
yet so in march
apparently periscope will be
discontinued but
you have the following options number
one
there may may or may not be
i do not know a replacement
so periscope will go away but we don't
know if twitter will
offer some kind of a replacement
let's just say i've heard
i've heard chatter that would suggest
that's at least a possibility
but in the meantime i'm always live on
youtube where i am live streaming even
right now
as as you listen to me and uh of course
i'll be on
locals a subscription platform that has
this stuff plus all of my stuff that i
don't show you
here because i would get in trouble
so the the stuff i put on the locals
platform
locals.com uh i do this stuff that i
think would be
maybe a little too edgy here or extra
stuff
and lessons on persuasion to turn you
into a superstar
um so those are similar options and it's
also available on
podcasts if you want to listen to it hey
there's a bunch of
good news on covet
uh oh and also uh i'm live on rumble as
well
so i don't know if i think we're we're
updated on that um so rumble
as well and also rockefin so any one of
those you can find it
good news on kovid uh
we've you've heard this before but it's
going to a new level which is
dogs being trained to detect covet
by sniffing your armpit now apparently
you don't need the dog to actually get
up get up in there
you can just take a you know some kind
of a towelette and
you know swab your armpit make it
available to the dog
and the dog they believe the people
studying this and there are a number of
pilot programs going on
but the people looking into it think the
dog would be able to get up to
between 75 and 100 percent
effectiveness now imagine how quickly
you could test if the dog could do it
let's say let's say you're uh you get
off an airplane or something
and they want to test you when you reach
the ground everybody gets a moist
towelette
everybody goes rat stand in line the dog
just walks down the line
boom the entire the entire plane is
cleared it's pretty good
if the this is one of those weird
situations where
the the least expected solution might be
the one that is just the kill shot
because if you can train dogs to do this
there's no technology that's going to
come close because
literally the dog can just walk through
a whole crowd
as long as they've you know swabbed
themselves and made it available
test the whole room you know 10 minutes
so and how long does it take to train a
dog
to detect a certain smell i don't know
the answer to that but i'll bet it's not
hard
i'll bet it's not the hardest thing
you've ever trained a dog to do
so dogs might be our savior there are a
number of pilot programs going on
and look kind of promising
now of course the other big big news is
the facts vaccines being rolled out and
all the conversation about who gets the
vaccination
first and all that conversation has been
kind of boring
because everybody says the same thing
let us discuss
who should get the vaccines first
all right i'll give you my novel opinion
you may not have heard this before but
i'm thinking
people in rest homes and nursing homes
and
maybe front line health care workers
just like a hundred percent of the other
people in the world
why are we even talking about it does
anyone
disagree now those are the easy ones
right
but there's also a big conversation
about who should do it
in front of the public because wouldn't
you like to see
uh joe biden get a vaccination
in public that would be good for i think
confidence
and i think that's good too and i i'll
tell you in my opinion
i'm pretty sure the vaccine is going to
be safe
but just in case you know
i i again i'm really sure the
vaccinations will be safe
but just in case
don't you think we should do kamala
before joe biden
yeah think about it think about it just
in case
um but the other thing that you should
not do
when you're deciding who should be on tv
getting the vaccination
you should not pick a cartoonist to go
first
let me tell you how that would go
because i've thought
you know i'm a public figure
so as a public figure i you know i don't
want to jump the line and
in fact i'd like to go last if i could
but i thought well maybe i have some
responsibility
right to show the public
you know that uh i'm willing to get the
vaccination
but i'm really the wrong person to do it
on tv or
any kind of a live stream because i'm
pretty sure i know how i would play it
and it would be like this you know i'd
be like
okay uh give it to me
i always look away i don't like to look
you know i don't mind getting shots
actually i just don't like looking at it
so so i look away and then there'd be a
little pinch you know they'd be like
you're going to feel a little pinched
and i'd be like and i'd be like
oh oh you've you're done
that's not bad i i really thought it was
going to be more than that it's a little
bit there's just like a little bit of uh
you know you could feel it i mean you
can feel that uh i got the vaccination
but i've been hearing people say it was
getting really
stiff and stuff actually i can feel a
little stiffness coming
yeah a little bit coming whoa whoo
whoa well because that packs quite a
punch
nothing you can't handle really but oh
god
whoa i
feel like i might pass out here but i'll
be fine and i
i highly recommend you should all get ow
wow
for those of you listening on podcast
what you missed was a hilarious
impression
of me becoming frozen
now i will say again
i will get the vaccination i'm sure the
vaccination is safe
uh if you didn't hear the story of how
the
vaccination process got sped up by
by trump it's really interesting
so here's a little tidbit that i heard
just yesterday listening to the news
which was that the normal uh process
if they do a big study is that the
fda i think it's the fda and whoever
they work with
looks looks at the data
for something like six months
i did not misspeak after a controlled
study
of a of a new drug the fda will look at
the data and really study it for
six months i think i got that right six
months
now have you ever studied data
i've i've studied data i've done it for
a living
i've never seen any data i needed to
study for six months
the study itself might take six months
but studying the data
took six months until
trump said not anymore
basically trump basically just said
no how about no it doesn't take six
months
to look at data what the hell
were they doing all the time
up until now if it took them months
to look at data do you know how long it
should take
even if there's a lot of data how long
it should take i'm thinking
days i'm not thinking months
and now apparently the people who do
these things said oh well i guess we'll
just do it in a
more reasonable compressed amount of
time i think they got it down to
i had my numbers approximate but it was
like
something like taking it from six months
down to one month
and i'm still saying to myself a month
what exactly takes a month
i can't think of any data that would
take a month to look at
if it takes a month to look at it
somebody organized it poorly
so you really need to be talking to
whoever gave you the data
because there should be things like
summaries and
you know totals at the bottoms of
columns and stuff i feel like they
should have done a lot of work for you
i don't know i was just amazed by that
so when you hear that
trump you know did the impossible with
the warp speed stuff
maybe maybe it was the impossible for
other people
but he just sort of made it happen and
then they just did it
and that's a lesson in in management
let me let me give you uh the rookie
lesson in management
followed by the experienced person's
lesson in management
here's what young people and people who
do not have experience
think management would look like manager
comes in and says to the
the project experts you know the manager
doesn't know much but the
people working on the project know the
details of the project
and the manager says i need you to be
done in a month
and the project experts say whoa i i
know that's what you want
but let me show you the timelines the
dependencies on the
project there isn't actually any way to
do this
in less than two months all right
now the inexperienced manager way
to look at this is well the person who
knows a lot more than i do
and i hired them and i trust them says
it's going to take two months i wanted
it in one
but i guess i have to accept two months
that's the inexperienced
person's view of management here's the
experienced person's view of management
i'd like this to be done in one month
it's very important
expert says no way to do this in less
than two months and here's my
reasons why manager looks blankly at
expert and says
do it in one month and then the
expert
does it in one month but without the
 part because the manager usually
leaves that part out
that's what an experienced manager does
because they know
that just about everything can be done
faster
and they have a sense of what that means
in any particular context if they're
good managers
right so when trump was presented i
wasn't
in the room but one can imagine
something like this happened
you can imagine somebody's saying to
trump and here's the process
and the reason it takes all these years
to do a vaccine is that it takes six
months to look at the data
and you can imagine the look on trump's
face i don't know if any of this
happened in real life
but you can imagine this imagine trump
listening to somebody tell him that the
phase of just
looking at the freaking data was going
to take six months
just imagine what he said right
i'll tell you what he didn't say well
you're the experts
i guess it takes six months to look at
data no
no maybe biden would do that because
biden says listen to the experts right
maybe he would have said what can you do
every single expert just said six months
if that's what it takes to look at data
and nobody's telling me
it could be done faster what are you
going to do
but i think trump like an experienced
manager
and exactly what i would have said had i
been president
in the room i would have said stop stop
hold on
i'm gonna need a little more explanation
about this six months to look at data
because you're not producing the data
you're just looking at it you're gonna
have to get that six months down to a
little bit
shorter or somebody's
gonna be fired i i'm guessing that that
was a lot of what it looked like behind
closed doors just
you know conceptually anyway so
uh vaccines coming um
today at uh 1 p.m
eastern time that would be 10 a.m for
you californians
i'm going to do a separate live stream
interview
with razeeb khan who's a spokesperson
for
traitwell t-r-a-i-t-w-e-l-l
and he's a geneticist and he'll tell us
about
traitwell's new system
i guess you'd say where you can upload
your dna
and some other information and it will
tell you your relative
your relative covered risk
how cool is that now does it work
is it real this is these are the
questions i will ask them
and uh i don't know the answers to the
questions we'll we'll find out
but imagine if you're trying to figure
out who should get the
vaccination first we'll also ask them
about dna and privacy and stuff like
that
so i'll get into that
so imagine if we could find out that
some people have much lower risk than
other people
and even after you've uh accounted for
comorbidities and lifestyle and age and
all that
um that should probably help us right if
we could actually say well
if we're going to do the high-risk
people first
it should at least help you identify
them all right
other good news it's just all good news
day
on covent the fda is actually
authorizing
its first over-the-counter at-home
covent test
you've been hearing me complaining about
the lack of the rapid tests
for a while now now i don't think this
is exactly the same thing i've been
talking about
because this might be a little bit of a
higher end
higher i don't know but it might be a
higher
sensitivity but cost a little bit more
still takes only 15 to 20 minutes to get
a
result at home with just your own nasal
swab test you don't have to send it
anywhere
it comes with an app and i think that'll
be available in a few months
that's huge now the problem is
um oh is somebody saying can he identify
adverse reactions to the vaccine um i
i'm sure that's not part of what they do
at
trade well but it's a heck of a question
that's a heck of a question i'll ask him
that thank you
um so
i had been saying that i thought there
must be some kind of either
uh why i was actually speculating there
was some kind of corruption
in our government for not already having
approved these over-the-counter
cheap tests i still think that's more
likely the case than other explanations
for why it wasn't here sooner
and why we don't have more of them and
maybe the lower sensitivity tests
as well there's still something going on
but when you hear
that it takes six months to look at data
i start saying
oh maybe it is possible that
incompetence could explain it
you know because i ruled out
incompetence
just because it's so long now that you
couldn't possibly say well
it's just things just take a long time
like i was ruling that out
but now you hear how long it really
takes or it used to take before trump
was
kicking their butts and you say to
yourself it's
actually maybe it wasn't corruption
could it be they were actually just that
incompetent
i didn't want to believe it because it's
easier to believe corruption but
maybe who knows
other good news covert wise is that
mcconnell says mitch mcconnell says that
the top
leaders in congress are going to stay
behind
and not go home from washington over the
holidays until they get
an agreement so he's talking about the
funding for
covent relief in a variety of ways but
if the rest of congress goes home does
it matter that the leadership
makes an agreement cause they can't vote
on it
because everybody went home so
isn't it really just an agreement to
see if they can agree among themselves
so then they can go home
but when congress comes back the rest of
congress might not agree
so it looks like just a clever way to go
home for christmas
without an agreement or at least without
any legislation
so the whole thing looks like
to me
but you know at least they know the
optics look bad if they all go home
so that's something
what are we going to do with history
it seems to me that in the old days the
the winning team got to decide what the
history was for the country right
so if so if your country you won the war
you get to write the history of the war
and
you write it your way but in the old
days
history would have basically one version
per country at least through high school
and you know most of college
you could find other versions but there
would be a mainstream version
now history is being written and
permanently recorded in the internet
so everything that's happening will just
sort of always be there
we think so how do you deal with the
fact that there are two completely
different histories
how do you write a history book at let's
say
the college level that would include
this this era what would you say
about the the trump administration would
you say
russia collusion was real would you say
the
find people hoax actually happened
would you say that the president really
did
uh suggest drinking bleach because these
are the things that will become the
permanent
record they become the new way the
history is recorded
it's no longer some consensus you know
winner puts it in one version literally
what do you do when you don't have one
history anymore
there will be at least two histories
minimum
you know you argue lots of them
but i'm thinking that
well let me put it in concrete terms
imagine if history
simply followed cnn's reporting
right imagine if they just didn't vary
from whatever cnn reported and we would
allow that if cnn ever
you know corrected anything that the
correction would stand
but basically the cnn's version of the
world
suppose you just took that and put it in
a history
class or textbook and said here's your
history it was in the news
and you know the new york times agreed
with them and the washington post agreed
with them
there's your news yeah think about it
would that be an actual history that's
scary i don't even know what they will
teach in school
i like actually literally i don't know
how they would teach it
because who would agree what the real
history was
so here's what i'm thinking is our
current situation
when it comes to investing i'll use an
analogy here
in investing one of the few things that
everybody agrees on
no matter what kind of an expert you are
on investing
pretty much everybody agrees on one
thing diversification
is really important because if you're
not diversifying putting your money in
lots of different bets
so that if some of them go bad you at
least by luck you'll have some that went
extra well to compensate so
in finance if you're trying to you know
pick one
winning stock you're just a sucker
because
people don't can't do that you know we
know that people don't have any skill
to pick individual stocks even really
really good people aren't good at it
but everybody can diversify right
so diversification fits it fixes
most of the problems that you would have
in the way you think about investing
just get that one thing right you're in
pretty good shape and i think the same
thing is going to be true for the news
and for history meaning that
you will have to read a diverse
bunch of sources to actually have any
idea what was going on
so you no longer can
take a source and say well here's here's
my news
you've got to diversify if you're not
watching the news on the left
and the right you're not watching
anything
and i wouldn't say that either of them
get it right
they get different things wrong at
different times but if you're not
seeing both you don't know what's going
on
you really don't know what's going on
so congress i mentioned this yesterday
reached this big
energy deal it looks like that includes
nuclear energy some new technologies for
that
promoting that stuff and also carbon
capture
now every person who's let's say
in the middle the political middle
thinks these are good ideas i'm
exaggerating a little bit but i would
say that people in the middle
whether they're democrats or republicans
if they're in the middle
they probably like nuclear energy now
on the right they might like nuclear
energy all the way
from left to right but pretty much it's
a good
middle position nuclear power uh
no matter what you think of climate
change you still probably think nuclear
energy is
required and carbon capture i don't
think anybody disagrees with it if some
company wants to
capture the carbon out of the air which
is a thing
and turn it into commercial products why
not
how could that be a bad idea so
so here's my point that i'm working
toward
i feel as if we we get lost in what
greg guff held often refers to as this
prison of two ideas
that you've either got your republican
or you've got your democrat
you know you've got your your your
lefties or your righties
and and your government is going to be
one of those two things
or if you're lucky it could be you know
deadlocked
but i think i think there might be
something that's
even better than that which is
alternating trump-like presidents
with biden like presidents
in other words the best situation might
be
not a trump-like candidate forever
and not a biden-like candidate forever
it might be and i would make a strong
argument for this actually
and i'm going to right now that your
best situation
is to alternate and the reason is that
they have different skills
and there are some problems that some of
them can solve
the other cannot so let me give you an
example of some things that i think
trump was uniquely qualified for and if
he hadn't done what he had done
much of it will be lasting i think if he
had not done those things
another president i don't think could
have done these things
but i'm going to tell you that also
there might be some things that biden
can get done
that you would want to get done things
that you would want that even trump
couldn't get done
because he was you know sort of
polarizing to say the least
so here are things that trump probably
did that are close to impossible
so the middle east peace deals making
north korea sort of a little buddy that
doesn't bother us too much
project warp speed incredible success
decoupling from china i don't think you
would have seen that from
really anybody else i don't think
anybody would have been as
effective with isis and we haven't had
much
terrorism problems have we uh i don't
think anybody would have done as good a
job with iran
if you think that that approach to it
was the right way to go to
you know put them in a position where
they'll have to negotiate
which is about where they are now uh
trump got
not just good employment he had record
low unemployment i don't know if another
president could have done that
uh you know he did the nafta deals he's
done other trade deals
that probably wouldn't have happened he
broke records for appointing judges if
you'd like that kind of judge
probably you know you needed trump to
have if if trump had not gotten
elected against all odds all of those
positions would have gone the other way
and that's a pretty
big big deal if you like that kind of
judge
and i would argue that even trump's wall
design
for the wall with the border of mexico
that even if biden says he doesn't like
it
and doesn't want to build a wall he's a
little bit stuck
and here's why you can get rid of bad
policies but it's hard to get rid of bad
design
and what trump did was good design
working with the experts
so they the specific kind of wall that
trump is putting up
even though it's replacement for you
know bad wall that even the democrats
thought
should be replaced his good design
is probably so good it's going to make a
difference
compared to the little walls and fences
they had before
i would expect that biden is going to
end up
making noise about tearing down the wall
or not building it and it will sort of
drift and morph into
okay we're only going to put wall where
we had wall before
which turns out to be the best place to
put it because where we had wall before
it wasn't a good wall but the only
reason there was any wall there at all
is because we really needed one so if
you replace the bad wall
with good wall which even democrats
would agree with
because you'd say we're not building
more wall we're just making sure that
you know these particular places don't
have an issue
and hey we got this good design and even
the experts are still saying it's the
best design it wasn't you know trump's
personal
you know design it was the experts that
trump approved
so i think biden is going to have to
keep
even the wall design because it just was
a better wall
they just figured out how to do it
better you know i
i think that'll last and i think even
biden will
uh will he'll not be as
tight as trump on the border but even
he's gonna have to do the obvious stuff
how about nuclear energy oh let me uh
go down the list the other things that
trump did that i think wouldn't have
been done he took a
took a swipe at the pharma costs i don't
know if that's going to be successful
but that
that thing where you get the most
favorite nations pricing
i don't think anybody else would have
even tried that
there's the telehealth across state
lines i don't think anybody else would
have changed
regulations as regular as readily as
trump did
so there's a whole bunch of things that
you just couldn't have gotten
that are either permanent or at least
the sticky
and you get to keep that stuff now
here's what a biden could bring you
even if you were a republican you ready
i think biden could do more for nuclear
energy
than trump for whatever reason trump
didn't like to speak about nuclear
energy
uh he's favor of it you know he's
mentioned it sort of on
in a list of stuff but biden probably
wouldn't get as much pushback from the
left
so maybe he can make something happen
sell
sell nuclear energy as it properly
should be sold to the left
as green energy that's really all he has
to do
if biden comes out tomorrow and says
hey you need to know that nuclear energy
is green energy
and it's not just important it's
probably the most important thing
if biden said that out loud
suddenly you could have a pretty robust
more robust nuclear energy thing
you might do something with health care
if he's a little less polarizing maybe
you'll get something done with
transportation maybe he can do more to
tamp down blm and antifa
who are really just a they felt like a
trump
response so there might be a bunch of
stuff you don't like about biden and i'm
not going to argue that
there was also a bunch of stuff you
probably didn't like about trump
even if you supported him my only point
is
that if each of these people do sticky
things
meaning that if each of them do what
they can do
that are good things the good things
stick
and then maybe it's time to try
something else next time
to pick up those those holes that the
other one left behind
well here's my take on the uh eric
swalwell
chinese spy lover story now i don't know
if the lover part
has been is just alleged or confirmed
i know that his staff at least at one
point refused
to refuse to deny that they were
intimately involved
which doesn't mean they were it just
means that that's
i guess you have to just say that's part
of the story
i don't like to say that about anybody
you know unless i saw it with my own
eyes
you know and i wouldn't want to see it
with my own eyes
but it's just part of the story now
let's say
that you believe that uh suawell was too
close to the chinese
spy and some people are saying he should
be removed from the intelligence
committee
because that sounds bad right
chinese spy intelligence committee
pretty bad
but the defense against that is that
there's no evidence
that he revealed any secrets
now i'll bet that's i'll bet that's true
you know whatever you want to say about
swalwell he is also
smart enough and he's in you know
background as an attorney
i think that he would be smart enough
that he would not have revealed any
intelligence secrets to even somebody he
was close to
i and i have no reason to believe that
he did
but is that your only problem
i don't think that's your only problem
now even if you could imagine
that he was smart enough not to let any
state secrets get to
any civilian it shouldn't matter whether
it was a spy or just a civilian
should have been the same standard of
you know no way know how
for the secret stuff and i feel like he
probably did that
but here's the real risk if you were a
planted
chinese spy now i'm using the word spy
i think that's fair right wouldn't you
say
and if you were a planted spy would you
be
untrained or
you did do they just say hey uh
christine fang fang fang as we like to
call you
your assignment is this young politician
and uh your job is to go help china
then what would she say uh help you in
what way
well you're you're gonna go do things
with
swell well and uh get close to him and
see what you can do
and then she would say see what i can do
in what way can you be more specific
am i stealing secrets what am i doing
well yes if you get an opportunity to
find out any secrets that's part of it
but here's the part the news leaves out
don't you think she was trained to
persuade
she's not just a receiver
right if you're going to make if you're
going to go through all the trouble to
plant
chinese spies all around the world in
key positions
are you going to send them there
untrained
you're not going to send her there
untrained now
let me give you a full scary thought
now since i don't know if she is trained
or trained in what way
this is all speculation
all right somebody's calling me a
democrat
apologist you might want to wait
if you think i'm a democrat apologist
yeah you might want to wait
um and by the way if you if you think
i'm
a democrat apologist you're a
idiot and you shouldn't be watching this
live stream you should really find some
other content that's less challenging
because that's not what i do here it's
not my job to be an apologist
for anybody and anybody who's been
around
long enough knows i will take any
position
that seems reasonable no matter where
that is i don't need to be anybody's
 apologist
so just go away go watch some other
content that's more to your liking
so here's my take on swalwell if you
really want to be
if you want to be frightened of what's
the worst case scenario
imagine if fang fang had my skill
just for persuasion now i don't mean
just you know me
specifically but anybody who was
trained the way i was
or indeed anybody who's even read my
books
would you want a chinese spy
be getting close to one of our
politician who had read any of my books
right it's kind of dangerous so
what do we know suawell was doing
uh at least at one point he was selling
the idea that
there was russia collusion and you know
how i'm always surprised when i find out
that democrats believe
what believe what they're saying imagine
if you will
that the reason that swalwell was so
convinced there was russia a collusion
is that maybe that had been suggested to
him
by somebody who was really really well
trained
as suggesting things
think about it we just we just went
through
years of this piss ant eric swalwell
looking
the public straight in the eye and
telling us he was pretty sure
this was all russia collusion
what if he believed it
now was there any point when you thought
he actually believed it
because you say to yourself they don't
believe that it's just something they're
saying
right he might have believed it
he might still believe it because
if you spend enough time with somebody
who is trained as well as
let's say i am just as an example
i'm not like the world's greatest
persuader i just
am trained if you spend enough time with
somebody who's trained
you will believe anything there's almost
no limit
to what a trained persuader could make a
swalwell
believe you want to even be more afraid
here it goes 20 percent of all people
politicians smart people dumb people
educated people uneducated people
people in all countries about 20 percent
can be convinced
of anything they can be convinced
there's something in the room that isn't
even there
they can be convinced that it's cold
when it's hot
they can be convinced of anything by a
trained hypnotist
now could try could china
detect who are in the 20
i don't know
but probably i don't know
but probably in other words they there
there's probably some signal that even
hypnotists haven't figured out by the
way
even a trained hypnotist can't can't
reliably
know who's going to be in that 20 short
of actually
trying it out it's very misleading you
think you would
because your common sense says well it's
going to be the
the people that you imagine have weak
minds but it isn't
there's no correlation with intelligence
education
gullibility there's just no correlation
with anything
and hypnotists know that they know
there's no correlation
but suppose you had massive amounts of
data
and you could study what influenced some
people
and then you could find out what signals
they give off in advance
that would tell you that they're the
type of people who could be signaled for
example
suppose you did a mass chinese
experiment on your own public and you
tried to influence people
to believe something ridiculous but not
harmful
because you're just testing it's
ridiculous
but not harmful then you find out
who believed it and you figure out what
is it about these people who believe
the most ridiculous stories what signal
do they give off
in other other realms the way they talk
some experience they've had if china
has looked for that they may have found
it
i'd love to know what they found because
if a hypnotist ever learned that
you'd be in real trouble because if
if they found some some signal or some
tell
where i could just learn it and learn
who the 20
are just you know by observing the
public
i would rule the world i don't even
think that's an exaggeration
you know as long as i imagine i'm the
only one who knew the secret
if i could tell who the 20 percent were
i could form an army i could rule the
world
that's how powerful this stuff is now if
swallow was in the 80 percent
and fang fang did not have any special
training
it's still super dangerous
there is a possibility that she had some
serious training
and it is a possibility he's in the 20
percent
and if he's not they've got a lot of
agents
in a lot of places do you know how many
times
they got the 20 by luck
20 yeah 20
of all of those chinese agents are with
somebody who can be convinced
of anything and then they will be
running
our government completely unaware that
they did not make up their own opinions
and did the news cover this story which
i would consider one of the biggest
uh potential holes in security i've ever
seen in my life
and there have been some big ones cbs
gave it zero minutes
nbc zero minutes abc two minutes msnbc
zero minutes
cnn three minutes
so there you go
uh joe biden back in 2007 there's a
clip of him on the internet this is like
one of the great
uh historical clip finds of all time
you know you love going back and finding
that hypocritical statement
but this one goes way beyond
hypocritical
there are some things that are just
hypocritical
but but listen to this and tell me if
hypocritical captures it because i think
it's hypocritical plus
there's a little extra going on here
i'll tell you about it
and this this is a direct quote from joe
biden on camera
talking to the public in 2007
quote uh he's talking about electronic
voting
machines which he was not in favor of at
the time unless they had paper back up
and he said quote
how are you going to keep it from us
being able to be in the position
where you can manipulate the machines
manipulate the records
i think we should pass a federal law
mandating that the same machines
have paper trails that are mandatory
blah blah let me read this first part
again
how are you who's you
how are you he's talking to the public
so
how are you the public going to keep it
meaning the voting machine situation
from us
us who the hell is us
he's talking to the public and the
public he is just referred to as you
but when he says us that's a subset of
the public
that includes him does that include
democrats or does it include politicians
i think it at least includes politicians
we'll give him the benefit of a doubt
that he was not he was not limiting that
to democrats when he says
us but at least politicians
being able to be in a position where you
can manipulate the machines
so in 2007 he knew that these were
at great risk to be to be manipulated by
politicians and thought it was a
tremendous risk
nothing happened apparently so his
warning was not heated
and so allegedly he used the loophole
that people
refused to close on his request
he used that loophole to become
president of the united states
now that's of course only under the
assumption that there was some
fraud here and as you know we do not
have
proof of such a thing
proof i say as opposed to evidence we
don't have court proof
of fraud at a level that would reverse
the election we might it might be on the
way
but we do not have it as of this
speaking
so this is one of the most just
jaw-dropping
shocking things and and i have to i have
to say
uh if it were true that biden knew this
was a way to
rig an election and if it were true that
let's say his operatives rigged it for
him
you know will give him the benefit of a
doubt that he never gave an order to rig
any machines
i think that's fair but if the irony is
that he was not heeded in his warning
and he became the president of the
united states because he was not
heated in his direct warning
it's kind of cool you know
this is sort of like my appreciation for
serial killers who
are also industrious you can hate the
killing part
but still they're very industrious
quite creative and if joe biden pulled
this off
you got to give him a little bit of
credit for using the loophole that
he warned you hey he warned you
here's the funniest thing in the news uh
cnn's uh
trying to mock trump about his shower
water standard so i guess this finally
got put into law
or whatever some kind of rule
that your shower head will now if
if you wanted to i guess you can get one
that has more
volume of water but here's the funny
part cnn reports
things that trump says at his rallies
without without adding the context
that when he's giving a rally talk he's
there for entertainment
when he gives a tweet he tweets like
people tweet
so right and he just does a better job
of it than anybody else
when he talks to a head of state he
talks to them like a head of state
and he does that well too so he adjusts
his communication and his style for each
of these
forms of communication better than
anybody's ever done in my opinion
uh far better than anybody's ever done
if you look at
all the different realms you could pick
any one realm and say somebody's
you know does a better speech or
something but there's nobody who
communicates as well
across multiple realms of communication
but what cnn does is they will act as
though they're all
they're all just one if you don't
understand that the things he says
at a rally are meant for entertainment
and you and you see it reported as if
it's a presidential statement of fact
it looks funny and that's what i'm going
to read to you
so this is these are trump's actual
words uh as reported by cnn from i don't
know what
rally quote
uh we have a situation
where we're looking very strongly at
sinks and showers
and other elements of bathrooms now
right away
he already has me because
never before has any as any president
shown a genuine concern for
your your bathroom inconveniences
now if you tell me that's not the best
example of the common touch you've
ever seen i will argue with you
nobody has ever applied let's say what
we call the common touch
better than you're going to hear right
now this is the common touch
you can't do this better okay so other
elements of bathrooms
where you turn the faucet on and
in areas where there's tremendous
amounts of water where the water rushes
out to sea
because you could never handle it
and you don't get any water the
president said last december during a
round table with business leaders oh so
i was doing a round table
then the president went on you turn on
the faucet
and you don't get any water
they take a shower and water comes
dripping out
just dripping out very quietly
dripping out the president continued
lowering his voice as he spoke about the
drips people are flushing toilets
10 times 15 times as opposed to once
now i stand corrected he said this in
the context of a round table
but he's he he used his rally speech
he just he did it at the round table
because it was a
now the fact that anybody could anybody
could read this and think that he was
serious when he says people are flushing
their toilets
10 to 15 times i mean i
i give up after six i don't know about
you i've never flushed the toilet 10 to
15 times
and i figure if this is an average
number and it's accurate
there must be people flushing their
toilet 25 times to make up for
my low number
but but you have to love
the way he makes this visual so let me
read it again but only listen to it
for the extraordinary choice of visual
uh persuasion so first of all you can
feel it
you can feel this because you can feel
the water as he talks about
you can feel it you can see it
and that those are two important things
all right so we have a situation
where the talking about the sinks and
showers where you turn the faucet on all
right so
so you can already you see in the movie
you turn the faucet on
and in areas where there's tremendous
amounts of water and now you're seeing
like this
this rush of water like coming at you
where the water rushes out to sea
now i'm seeing the ocean i've seen the
ocean and i'm seeing this pipe
with all the water that came from my
house that i couldn't handle
i couldn't handle that kind of water i'm
not meant for that kind of water i can't
handle that
but all this water is rushing through
and it rushes out to the ocean
the sea uh and then you turn the faucet
on and you don't get any water and now
i'm seeing the faucet and there's like
nothing coming out i'm like great and
it's just
you know dry or sand is coming out or
something and
it's just dripping out very quietly
dripping out it's not just dripping out
it's dripping out so slowly that the
drip is quiet
you can't even hear the drip it is such
a silent drip
now you see the drip right you see it
now you hear the drip
you hear the freaking drip
it's quiet it's not one of these trap
trap trap things the president is very
clear on this it's not a big drop it's a
it's a low drip that's they're so bad
all your
all your water is rushing out to sea
it's rushing out to sea and all you get
is
and you're flushing your toilet you're
like flushing and flushing
and the flush in the toilet 10 times up
to 15 times
it's it's like a little movie within a
movie because you put yourself right in
that scene and you're
and you're standing in front of your
toilet and you're like nope
nope ah that's 11. i think four or five
more times might get it
nope anyway this is some of the best
communication the world has ever seen
and when i tell you that trump will be
appreciated more every year after his
term or terms however many there end up
being
i am really serious about that i'm as
confident as i could be
that as as the noise and the fog clears
and you just see the things he he pulled
off
the the things he did that other people
can't
do won't do have never done and will
never do again
it is truly extraordinary even even if
you allow
every criticism to be true the things
that he did are just simply
extraordinary
um here's big news uh i guess
this was news from june but i didn't see
it until recently
uh 66 million years ago an
ancient marine reptile that they think
was a
mosasaur that which is a really big
dinosaur i guess
crawled down to the water and left a
football-sized egg in antarctica
which has been discovered so scientists
have in their
possession a dinosaur egg
from an extinct giant marine reptile
now i'm glad i didn't find it first
because i would have been tempted to
make an omelette out of it
because you don't want to leave it for
somebody to clone this egg
i don't know if it has enough material
in it to clone us a proper dinosaur
but i feel like we're getting closer to
that jurassic park wise
so we're gonna maybe have a dinosaur
but i would have just sort of eaten it
as an omelet
i know you can't really make an omelet
out of a fossil
come on come on yeah i don't i didn't
see in the story whether they got any
useful dna on it that would be the big
question right
um and then lastly president-elect
uh biden can we call him that let's just
call him a
uh perspective maybe president biden
probable president biden
he picked for his department of energy
former governor jennifer uh granholm
now here's the fun part of the story
i've seen
jennifer granholm as a pundit on cnn
i think just cnn lots and lots of times
i didn't know she was a governor so i
knew i knew she had some role
that made her a capable pundit but i
didn't know she was governor i only just
knew her from lots of appearances on cnn
but here's the funny part while i often
disagree with people on cnn
i don't often think they're batshit
crazy
so for example if i see you know jake
tapper say something
i might disagree with it but i don't
think he's
bad crazy he seems completely sane
but jennifer granholm and i'm not saying
this
because she's female i know you want to
you want to jump on that right
oh you said the man's not crazy but why
is why is the woman got to be crazy
there are plenty of crazy men
do you need me to list all the crazy men
feel better
will you feel better then if i do that
i'm not going to
but they're crazy people all over the
place but i remember
watching her and thinking well she is
just badger crazy
i guess she was a big russia collusion
truther
so she does have a history of being
really really gullible
here's the punch line she'd be in charge
of our
nuclear energy which i think includes
nuclear weapons
at least the civilian aspect or
scientific aspect of it
i don't know if joe biden could have
made a worse choice
if he's trying to make me feel
comfortable about that area
i actually can't think of anybody who
would make me
feel less confident that a
a serious people i mean really you can
name a lot of people
even people that you you're annoyed by
who are you know let's say on cnn but
they don't look crazy
don lemon doesn't look crazy i mean
unless you count a little bit of tds
but
[Applause]
i think that's a sketchy choice there
bye bye fracking maybe we'll see i think
even fracking is going to be too sticky
the the problem like i said before and
it applies to a lot of different areas
there are a whole bunch of things that
trump did
that even if you wanted to reverse them
they're really sticky
take north korea what will joe biden do
with north korea
i don't know if he'll have a meeting
with kim jong-un but he's probably not
going to want to
modify the current situation too much
right
it's sort of sticky the way it is so
uh adam schiff looks psychotic well what
would
what would you think if we found out
that the main
russia collusion advocates
all had some connection with a chinese
spy
now i'm not saying that's the case i'm
saying
it would explain a lot wouldn't it
you know because you would assume that
china would want to redirect our
attention
toward russia and away from them right
so if
if it turned out and i think i tweeted
about this as soon as i found out about
the swalwall thing
i think i tweeted that if adam schiff
doesn't have a close connection to a
chinese
spy i would be surprised
i don't have any information that that's
the case but he acts in a way
that you you look at it and you go uh
what's going on there
is he a 20 percenter if i had to guess
probably is probably is so
but i there's no way to know all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you
tomorrow
all right periscope is off you youtubers
still here for now
uh yeah
all right do you have any questions for
me
uh am i happier today well i
i'm really stoned right now so that
really worked
people usually think i'm i'm high when i
do my morning periscopes
but i assure you that except for today
uh that has not been the case
all right thank you uh that is all for
now oh yes and um
season five of the expanse thanks for
reminding me
season five of the expense is on tonight
and i will be watching that uh
thoughts on dueling electors well you
know i guess
technically the
you know trump still has some whiff of a
chance
but i don't think having a uh i don't
think having a path
to victory makes any difference at this
point because i think the system has
decided that it doesn't matter if he has
a path or not
it doesn't matter if the election was
thrown doesn't matter
how much fraud they find at this point i
think
it's just too late all right um
that's all for now and i'll talk to you
later
you
