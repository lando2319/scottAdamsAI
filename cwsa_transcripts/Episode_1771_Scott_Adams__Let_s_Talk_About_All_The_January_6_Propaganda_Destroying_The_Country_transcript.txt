good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
you know it doesn't get much better than
this no that's a lie it does get better
than this and all you need to do is to
simultaneous sip to take it up a notch
because you know I've now connected in
your brain
your dopamine producing circuitry with
this experience now all you need to do
is do the simultaneous Sip and your
brain will say I remember this this is
when I produce those good chemistries
for your brain chemistries let's say
that's a word
and all you need to take it up a notch
is a couple of my girl so thank you
jealous this time the canteen Jugger
flask a vessel love any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the end of
the day the thing makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous hip go
yeah yeah I can feel everything coming
online now
well how many of you are watching
basketball
anybody watching the basketball finals
if you're not don't worry I'm not going
to talk too much about sports
but I'll tell you what fascinates me
about it is that when you get to the
finals you have two Elite teams
and I swear to God I can tell who's
going to win
by their faces
now that's probably just you know
confirmation bias or something like that
but last night I'm watching and
I thought well the Warriors look like
they haven't decided to win
they just didn't look like they had
decided they they look a little sleepy
or something and then sure enough they
start
playing in what I thought was not well
enough to win
so it gets but they kept it close
they kept it close to the end and there
was one there was one interesting point
where the coach coach Kerr uh goes nuts
and he you know yelling at the ref over
a bad call and gets called for a
technical
and I always thought that is such good
coaching because the problem with his
team is they weren't mad enough
so that the coach basically you know
made himself angry enough to try to lift
the team
and I think it really works yeah I you
know I think it's a technique when the
when the coach goes off
I think it's a controlled anger because
they're trying to bring the team up
right oh we got screwed you know let's
let's win anyway
but here was the interesting part
probably the best player on the field
and there were some great great players
on the other team was Stephen Curry
so it gets to the last few minutes of
the game
and then
Curry who always gets the ball first
because he's the ball handler
he has to decide if he's going to pass
it to someone else
or shoot through the four people who
have collapsed on him because they
they're going to do anything to get the
ball out of his hands in the final
minutes
and you could tell
that the greatest basketball player
probably who's living at the moment
decided to win
it was the damnedest thing to watch he
literally just decided and you could
just see it in his face a complete
change of demeanor he went from like
sleepy time you know make my baskets
blah blah blah last five minutes
Stephen Curry just said I don't care who
else is in the building
none of you are gonna matter
it was like 15 000 people in the
building you know 10 players on the
Courts Plus the the coaches millions of
people watching it
and and Stephen Curry
made it very clear to every one of us
that we didn't matter
the only person who mattered
was him
and you could see it in his face and he
just decided he just decided and then he
just took over the game
and every time he had the ball something
good happened and
won the game and
it is just an amazing if you study
persuasion you know on top of sports if
you watch it for the sports that's
pretty good sports it actually they are
fun games
but watching watching the mental part
and watching their coach you know manage
that and then watching the best player
in the world manage his own attitude up
you can see him he was like hitting his
chest and and working himself up because
he knew
he knew that at his best
nobody could touch him
but he wasn't playing at his best and so
watching him like bring himself up to
his highest level and then just take
over the take over the whole thing it
was just amazing so watch it just for
that
um
Justin Bieber
has a partially paralyzed face we had to
at least temporarily cancel his uh
singing
so I guess he got shingles
and one of the rare things that can
happen is it can I think it's temporary
because he's working on you know
exercises and stuff to bring it back
but
um of course
what are people saying
of course
at least on social media people are
saying and you got vaccinated right
and people are saying well let's see the
vaccination was for a virus and shingles
is a virus and maybe one has caused the
other to be worse or something like that
but uh this was not Bell's Paul it's not
Bell's palsy but it's it's something
like that it has a different name
but
um Let me let me toss my own anecdotal
evidence into this
first of all I don't think there's any
evidence to suggest that anything with
covid or vaccinations have anything to
do with
Justin Bieber's situation right it's a
one-off situation probably
let me tell you what happened to me
recently that's weird
many of you know that I don't know 15
years ago or whenever it was I lost my
ability to smell
now I got it back recently a couple
years ago when I was prepping for some
sinus surgery I was doing prednisone and
when I was on prednisone it cleared up
my sinuses and I could smell for the
first time in 15 years or whatever it
was
but it didn't last so I had decided
surgery and once I recovered I didn't
have any sense of smell so I went back
to no sense of smell
and then I got covered
and as soon as I was recovering from
covid
my sense of smell came back and it's
still there
now not on any medications so I know
it's not some temporary medication thing
uh I don't know if that's a coincidence
now if I had not just had kovid I would
say to myself oh I don't know why but it
came back
yeah my sense of smell completely
returned and it's kind of overwhelming
because there are foods that I've
started eating
after I'd lost my sense of smell
that I found out I don't like
and I'd never quite tasted them before I
was responding to the texture and the
you know maybe the salt or something
uh so you tell me do you think coven
returned my sense of smell
because if kovid works on that part of
the brain that controls your sense of
smell and they say that they say that's
the thing right
if it can take away your sense of smell
it must be dealing with something about
smell
is that is that a coincidence
what do you think
probably a coincidence right so my point
is that if you look at Justin Bieber and
say well he got vaccinated and or he had
coveted and then he got this they're
related probably not
probably not every single person who had
a health problem this year
it was probably either after they had
coveted or after they had a vaccination
or both
so I wouldn't make too much of that but
we wish Justin Bieber well
um so the news is that the Biden
Administration wants to get closer to
Saudi Arabia and do some kind of a reset
and be friends with Saudi Arabia
despite the fact
that they are accused of killing that
khashoggi guy
now what was my prediction about what
Biden would end up doing in the long run
whatever Trump did
my prediction was that Biden would have
to eventually
start doing whatever Trump was doing
that worked
so you know they start out with doing
whatever Trump did we won't do but the
trouble is a lot of stuff he did worked
you you pretty much can't ignore the
fact that a lot of what he did worked
and so now Biden has grudgingly decided
that Saudi Arabia needs to be our friend
despite the horribleness that they
allegedly
uh were involved in
did we have to wait
yeah did we have to go through this
whole period of them not taking Biden's
phone calls and not pumping more oil if
we want him to that was all wasted time
wasn't it it was all a complete waste of
time
to act like we weren't going to work
with Saudi Arabia or or be as friendly
as we could be
so Trump was right again
uh on a positive note airlines in the
U.S anyway have dropped the requirement
that you've got to get tested for covid
before you come back into the United
States
so
that's good
that's good
who knows if that'll last
once again mushrooms are in the news and
mushrooms are going to be the big story
of the next 20 years
but this is from a CNN story now it's
also useful
to point out that CNN is reporting on it
so there is a mainstream acceptability
to
um psilocybin and mushrooms
not for party purposes but as actual you
know medical purposes and as of today
here are the things
the very smart people believe can be
treated by mushrooms just listen to this
list
depression
apparently it's better better than you
know the regular Pharmaceuticals
PTSD
right if I stop now it would already be
the greatest miracle drug ever if the
only thing you did was depression
well if that's the only thing it did it
would be the greatest drug ever
but it also does PTSD which for some
reason seems to
affect like half of us so those two
things alone would be the wonder drug of
all Wonder drugs if it actually did that
but they also think is strongly
indicated to help with cluster headaches
now if you don't know what a cluster
headache is I've never had one
but my understanding is there are a few
things that hurt more than that
the cluster headache apparently is a
really bad bad bad bad thing
my help with that
um and other painful conditions
um
yeah
so just think about that
oh it also might help with anxiety
anorexia OCD and various forms of
substance abuse
all right are you getting this yet
it's almost impossible it's almost too
big
to even hold in your head at the same
time that there's one widely available
practically free I mean compared to
pharmaceutical costs widely variable
thing that can help you with cluster
headaches anxiety anorexia OCD
depression substance abuse
and one other one
oh
oh my God
it's just not real somebody says
I don't know because every test is every
time they test it they get the same
result
I'm not I don't think I've heard of one
test of mushrooms where they got a bad
result
it looks pretty real to me
so that's a big deal
uh CNN is reporting that what Putin
really wants is an imperial Empire back
like the old days and that Russia is
really an imperialist country and they
need to own other countries and dominate
their neighbors and stuff like that and
apparently Putin is talking like that
about being compared to Peter the Great
and other conquerors
um can we conclude at this point that
Putin won the war or lost the war in
Ukraine
if I had to ask you did Putin win the
war or lose the war
looks like you won
but you know there's still a thing that
will be called Ukraine so everybody gets
to say they won I guess
everybody won a little bit
you didn't lose it yeah you definitely
didn't lose the war
so
I'm not sure if we know what he intended
to do with the larger Ukraine I'm still
of the point of view that he took a run
at taking the whole country
but when that wasn't easy he settled for
you know 90 of the good part which was
pretty smart
yeah I think Putin is not going to die
of any disease he's not going to be
deposed he won the war
and you will probably be more popular
when it winds down at least internally
so I don't know it looks like we know
how this ends now don't we I feel like
we know the end game the end game is
Putin says I democified this place and
and then we say we kept you from taking
Kiev and everybody wins except the
Ukrainian people and all the soldiers
who died and their families
um
let me say this
anytime people show you edited video
whether the the clip is edited or is put
together with other clips from other
things
and anytime that they put a audio
overlay over that especially if the
audio comes from a different time or
place which is what the January 6
committee is doing
so they're putting together selected
videos that have been edited the way
they want them edited and they've put
audio overlay in one case of trump
giving you a speech and making it sound
like he was praising the people who were
being violent when he was talking about
you know a peaceful protest
and here's the thing are we not
sophisticated enough yet as voters and
the public
to know that whenever anybody does this
it's propaganda
it wouldn't matter who did it
if the pope makes you a mixed video
is propaganda
if your best friend that you trust
completely
makes you a video compilation and puts
some audio over it
your friend is manipulating you
it's not your friend
I don't know how much more clearly I can
say it there's no exception to this
that that's the part that people
probably don't get
people probably say well I get that
video could be misleading
no
no I'm not saying video could be
misleading it's only misleading it is
only misleading because you can only get
little uh pinpoint views of a much
larger event
so there's no way that the pinpoints of
you know this little video clip this
little video clip and then they decide
which of those are shown and then they
put them together in the order that they
put them and they put extra audio over
it and they put the anguished cries of
the uh the law enforcement people who
were most worried or sounded most
worried and they leave out the ones who
maybe were less worried
every bit of that
should is Criminal basically everybody
should be Criminal it should be Criminal
but we're allowing our government to do
something right in front of us this
should be this should be against the law
but the only reason it's not is that the
people doing it make the laws
it should be against the law let me say
it is much more clearly
the process of publicly showing edited
videos
to defame and hurt the reputation of
another person
in public without allowing any any
rebuttal should be illegal
now I get freedom of speech and all that
but that would be allowing Somebody To
You Know respond
if somebody could respond in a way that
was you know met the met the topic
well I'd say okay well that's just free
speech people are lying but then other
people are correcting them that's the
best you can do
but if you have your government
giving you misleading edited audio and
video with the purpose of changing the
course of politics in this country
that's their stated purpose well obvious
purpose I don't know if it's stated but
the obvious purpose is to degrade
Republicans chances in elections
they're doing this right in front of us
it should actually be illegal
because it's it's just abuse they're
abusing the public they're abusing uh
Republicans they're abusing Democrats by
making the Democrats think this is some
kind of a you know a reasonably
transparent system it's not it's just
propaganda
and I'm kind of amazed that we put up
with it
Al Franken uh tweeted I don't see anyone
watching talking about the January 6
hearings he says I don't see how anyone
watching isn't infuriated and
heartbroken
and I agreed
but I don't think we're watching it with
the same filter
when I'm watching I am infuriated
I'm infuriated at what they're doing to
us right now like right in front of us
they're not even hiding the fact that
this is a purely political process
nobody's hiding it they're just trying
to hurt other members of the United
States
conservatives so
yes I agree with you Al Franken it is
infuriating and heartbreaking not only
for the reasons that he says which I
completely agree with if you watch the
videos and you see the actual real
violence and people had
serious injuries serious injuries the
law enforcement people there's nothing
to joke about so yes that that was
infuriating and heartbreaking to see all
those injuries and that violence
uh but it's also infuriating and
heartbreaking
to see how the Democrats have weaponized
that
to use it against people who were not
there doing any violence
so yeah it's really disgusting
both ways both ways you're completely
right Al Franken it's disgusting in
exactly the way you say it is
but also
but also
if I had to rank them for which was
worse
the events of January 6 or
the hearings
it's not even close
the events of January 6 with the
violence really bad
really bad like I'm not minimizing the
violence that was really bad
but it's not as bad as what the
Democrats are doing in the hearings
I consider that worse because the risks
are higher
you know the there was no risk that the
country was going to be overthrown on
January 6. that wasn't a risk
you know I've been not really
nobody could hold the country because
they what they controlled the
the room we we have this room now we
control the country it doesn't really
work that way you could control any room
in the country and it wouldn't give you
control the country
so there wasn't really that much risk
except the specific violence that
happened tragically
but this but this hearing
this January 6th thing is to me this is
a gut punch to The Republic
because the fact that we even allow this
as a public
I feel like an Insurrection right now
like I didn't feel any urge whatsoever
to storm the capital after the election
not once did I say to myself ah I wish I
was there storming that Capital not once
not once but I watched the hearings and
I think I actually want to storm the
capital during these hearings because
they're just us right in front
of us
they're not even trying to hide it
right the fact that that they're not
allowing any counter counter argument in
a practical sense they're not allowing
any
is so disreputable
so disgusting so non-american
that if I were going to do an
Insurrection and I don't recommend it so
I don't recommend any violence no
insurrections but if I were going to do
one they're talking me into it pretty
well
right the Democrats are doing a real
good job of saying that they should be
overthrown
because you know who you should
overthrow
a government that is screwing the public
right in front of you with impunity
they're screwing the public right in
front of you with impunity
that is a cause for insurrection
now I don't recommend it I'm just saying
that
what they're doing is worse than the
actual event that they're talking about
does anybody agree with that that the
hearings are worse
than actually January 6 and January 6
was plenty bad
not minimizing January 6 not even a
little bit but the hearings are worse
the hearings are worse
so I think there should be a hearing
about the hearings
I think when Republicans take control
there should be a hearing about why this
these hearings were allowed to happen
and then the Democrats should not be
allowed to respond
why
just to let them know how it feels
just just to give them a sense of
whether that was a good idea that the
you know having a little bit of power
let them just completely stop the other
point of view
so when the Republicans take control
they should immediately
put together a an impeachment thing for
a Schumer right you have to impeach
Schumer
for saying that the
the Supreme Court Justices or are we
going to reap the Whirlwind and
obviously uh it caused some attempted
violence against uh Kavanaugh and his
family
so I think the Republicans have to push
humor up for impeachment
they just have to like that just has to
happen right
the the other thing they should do is a
hearing on how this hearing was put
together because I think they could
produce evidence that it was a purely
political propaganda hack job and
everybody involved should be censored
or censured or whatever it is centered
why not
because we keep treating it like it's
normal or something
the the January 6 hearings are not
normal
this is an attack on part of the country
that's the whole point of it is to
degrade Republicans
so I'm going to call uh
I'm going to call it the big lie that
the January protesters the enemy six
protesters
wanted anything more than a credible
election outcome
because here's the question that nobody
is asking even even the conservative
news entities
here's a question I want to see a
Democrat asked
do you believe
that if the election had been both
transparent and easy to audit so that we
could sort of quickly say Okay that was
completely right
do you think that even one Republican
would have marched on the capitol
if they were sure that the election was
credible
and they could audit it and we could
find out for sure
not one
not one no Oath Keepers no proud boys
no no Steve bannon's no nobody
no nobody even Trump would have said
well damn it
I guess I lost even Trump would have
said that
so why are we ignoring the big problem
which is clearly the big problem that
the election was not credible
we act like that's not the big question
the big question is what people did
about an election that wasn't incredible
now remember when I say not credible
and I have to say this so I don't get
kicked off of social media when I say
the reelection wasn't credible I mean
people didn't believe it
not that it was rigged or that it was
inaccurate so I don't have any evidence
that would suggest the election was
anything but accurate personally
but I also don't have any way to know
so I'm saying it's not credible because
we can't know if it was accurate we
could just know that the courts didn't
find anything
which is completely different
than knowing everything was fine
um
so
that's the big lie the big lies that
Democrat that Republicans were there and
would have been there even if they knew
Trump lost
do you think there's any any oath keeper
or proud boy
who if they knew that Trump lost they
knew it
would have protested
I mean that way
none
here's the other big lie that the
Democrats are telling about the the
hearing and it goes like this
uh Bill Barr believed that the election
was fair
therefore logically
Trump is lying when he says he didn't
believe it was fair
do you see the connecting tissue there
there the Democrats are saying this in
public with a straight face
let me say it again so you can follow
the logic
Bill Barr told Trump that in Bill Barr's
opinion the election was fair
therefore
Trump must have secretly believed it and
he's lying when he said it wasn't
what what is that
does anybody think
that that makes sense
the Republicans are saying that
matter-of-factly
like there's some logical connecting
tissue between what Bill Barr thinks and
what Trump thinks
is not the most common thing in the
Trump era
that Trump disagreed with not only his
advisors but everybody else
the most common thing that Trump does is
disagree with everybody
it's one of the reasons people like him
right is because he's not afraid to
disagree with anything
he'll disagree with anything
now do you believe that Trump believed
that he lost
do you think that Trump said well if
Bill Barr says I lost I guess I lost no
let me let me not read Trump's mind but
I'm going to read his mind now
all right because I always tell you you
can't read minds and so you don't really
know what anybody thinks and now I'm
going to do it anyway
Trump thinks
that he's smarter than Bill Barr
about this
if you're Trump
why would you think Bill Barr was right
why would you think that because Bill
Barr did an audit of the system
no he didn't do a audit of the
system
is it because
the system was transparent
no it's not because the system was
transparent
is it because Bill Barr had extra
information about the election so he
knew it was credible whereas other
others did not no he didn't have any
 extra information
he was one guy with a opinion
that was good for him
Bill Barr had an opinion with no factual
basis whatsoever that coincidentally
happened to be good for Bill Barr
right because Bill bark can now say well
I don't agree with Trump now I think
that was his actual opinion I'm not
saying he was lying I think Bill Barr's
actual opinion is the election was
you know there's no evidence of a fraud
but the thought that Trump would believe
Bill Barr when Bill Barr's opinion is
not based on anything
it's not based on anything
he's just saying he hadn't seen any
information and therefore the claims
were yeah and some of the claims were
obvious BS you know that the Venezuelan
Maduro connection and stuff like that
now I I said those those were BS as well
they were obvious yes in my opinion
so I I guess I can't get past the fact
that the news can say anything now
like that is just a ridiculous thing to
say that because Ivanka and Bill Barr
thought the election was fair therefore
Trump did
that is the most ridiculous ridiculous
assumption and they're just selling that
like that's a matter of fact it's not
you don't even need to discuss that if
Bill Barr knew then obviously Trump knew
nope no logic to it at all
it's not it's not even likely
it's not only illogical it's not even
I mean it almost seems impossible
all right
so I had a little back and forth with
an anti-trumper CNN connected person uh
Asha rangappa rangapa
on CNN she works for CNN sometimes
um so she tweeted
that you could tell that there was
violent intent
and she quoted a number of people to
show that there was clearly premeditated
violent intent so here are the quotes
showing you that there was premeditated
violent attempt Trump said quote it'll
be wild
it'll be wild
and said quote all hell is going to
break loose
oath keeper said there's no standard
political or legal way out of this
and the proud boy said quote standing by
Sir
so according to Asha if you put those
all together
there are strong indications that uh
that the proud boys Oath Keepers Bannon
and Trump were at least on the same page
with a suggestion that they may have
coordinated but there's no evidence of
that
but it sort of suggested
and
and that this language is indicating uh
an intention for violence
now does any of that sound like an
intention for violence to you
because it's presented as if we'll look
at it right here you can look at it with
your own eyes and I read them and I
thought
it'll be wild
it'll be wild
that's what Trump said it'll be wild
that's a call to violence wild it sounds
like a party it sounds like a an active
protest it'll be wild
be a lot of people
or all hell is going to break loose
I mean that's what protests are right
all hell breaks loose it's sort of
hyperbole
standing by
standing by is literally the opposite of
go do something
it's
I guess if you take it to that next
level it's like but he means stand by
until I tell you to do some violence
it's not really there
just to standby part
um
and that there's no standard political
or legal way out of this so
I responded to this by to that tweet
from Asha by saying conservatives are
now shy about recommending violence when
the situation calls for it if they ever
do call for violence it won't look
anything like these words
do you agree with me
do you agree that if conservatives ever
did call for violence it wouldn't look
like this
yeah yeah let me tell you how I would
not call for violence now I don't
identify as conservative but just use
myself as an example
if I wanted you to be violent on my
behalf you know to join me in an
Insurrection here's what I would not say
it's going to be wild
or stand by
I wouldn't use any of those words
so so when I said that that's not how
conservatives would talk if they
actually were planning violence
um Asha responded to me and she goes
cool
will it look something like and then she
gave a quote from one of the indictments
so there's one of The Oath Keepers who
is being indicted for uh
for uh seditious conspiracy
and one of his quotes this oath keeper
guy is quote we will have to do a bloody
massively bloody
Revolution against them
in other words if things didn't go his
way or if Biden got elected I think they
said we will have to do a bloody
massively bloody Revolution against them
and then Asha says
um
will it look like that
so what do you think did she make her
case
that conservatives were talking in a
premeditated way about Violence Center
well here's the first question
if you had this quote
why did you go with Trump saying it'll
be wild
if you've got somebody literally saying
let's do a bloody massively bloody thing
why would you use these other quotes
do you know why
you would use the other quotes because
they're about specific people who had
nothing to do with the administration
the whole point of this fake hearing is
to embarrass Trump in the administration
and this oath keeper there's no way to
tie them to the administration it's just
somebody
who had that point of view now
let me ask you this
I think that Asha rangappa
probably doesn't spend too much time
with Second Amendment loving
conservatives
because
even on social media
conservative talk talk about Bloody
revolutions every day
it's hard to go it's hard to go a week
without some conservative saying well
we're going to have to get on our guns
and have a bloody Revolution
it's like a Tuesday for conservatives
and if you'd never heard it like you
didn't I was just it's sort of just the
normal hyperbole way that they talk
you would think that they actually meant
it
but it literally is just how they talk
because the context is the Second
Amendment
and its function as they would see it as
they would see it is function to protect
the country if things go too bad you
know you can do your violent revolution
if you have to
so it's just how they talk
now they also make it conditional
have you ever noticed that
when conservatives talk about oh there
could be a bloody Revolution whatever
it's always conditional
if things went too far
we have this option
they don't say on Tuesday yeah you're
gone and meet me in the capitol
they say if things went this far
it's a good thing we have these guns you
know things would get wet
and this oath keeper was also talking in
the hypothetical
we will have to do a bloody massively
he's now saying
meet me here and we're going to do this
it again is that hypothetical uh tough
gun talk that Republicans do and I'll
have to admit if you had never heard it
before
it would sound a lot like these planning
a revolution
but if you're used to hearing it all the
time as I am now tell me if I'm wrong
give me a fact check of this
so I'm asserting that it is normal
for Republicans to talk tough about
Bloody revolutions with guns
but don't really mean it
because it's always if this went too far
but it never goes that far
what do you think
is it typical talk and do you not take
it as being too serious
yes bravado
it's it's the reason they have guns
if your whole reasons for existing
is to depend defend the Republic then
when you talk about your reason for
existing you would say things such as if
things go too far
we're going to use our guns to do
something bloody
so
somebody says I'm on point today is it
because I took mushrooms no
you know what it is a number of people
have told me that in the last week my
podcasts have been unusually good
lately now I think they're right because
I I felt it myself but has more to do
with what's in the news
if the topics in the news are straight
up propaganda
then I have something to say
but if all the news is about Justin
Bieber's face
I don't have as much to say so there's
not so much that I got more clever
recently it's just the news is more in
my sweet spot
all right let me tell you what it might
look like if conservatives ever decided
to Stage a bloody Revolution
are you ready
this will be my impression
of conservatives who had actually
decided not just talking about it
actually decided
to have a bloody Revolution
here's how they talk about it
do you understand yet
you understand right
don't worry until it gets quiet
that's all I'm going to say and don't
worry until they stop talking
if they're talking
they're not serious
when they stop talking
you better hide
[Laughter]
it's the stopping talking you got to
worry about really
because if you have a gun and you plan
to do something bad with it unless
you're like a crazy Mass shooter special
cases
but if you're actually just trying to
defend the country with an actual gun
and it's an actual plan you're not going
to talk about it
I mean you're not going to talk about it
in some public kind of way
so
anyway there is a big difference uh this
is one of those situations that I think
if you don't spend enough time around
the other you know whoever's on the
other political side you don't really
understand what they're saying
like even the words mean different
things to them
so there's so much that conservatives
talk about the sounds completely
different on the left
and I don't think they realize it
because you know lots of times there's
making stuff up and trying to frame
things in the worst possible way but
sometimes I think they honestly don't
understand uh how conservatives talk and
think
but um anyway when Anna had to retreat
to this seditious conspiracy oath keeper
situation
uh notice the trick that they all play
it's the conflating trick
well let me tell you how violent a
Trump's Inner Circle is so here are some
quotes about all the violent things that
his inner circle said okay they don't
actually sound violent well then let me
take a violent statement from somebody
who has nothing to do with Trump or any
of his advisors
okay well that looks pretty violent
doesn't it
I rest my case now wait a minute you
don't rest your case
your case was that Trump and his
advisors were planning something violent
there's no evidence of that
you you had to go to a whole different
guy
who had nothing to do with anything
to come up with some violence and then
you pretended like somehow those were
all the same topic that's not the same
topic
it's completely not the same topic but
if you just say it fast
you know you can get your side to agree
that it was the same topic
so AOC uh
decided to argue with data
about this gun gun control situation
and uh
she tweeted that according to CBS News
and of the top 10 deadliest cities in
America seven of them are in
republican-run States what do you think
about that
um
what do you think about that but that's
something you've never heard before did
you 7 and a ten of the deadliest cities
are in republican-run States
apparently it's true
apparently is true
does that change your opinion about
anything
seven of the ten deadliest cities in
America are in republican-run States
why are you asking who the mayor is of
those cities
what is I have anything to do with
anything yes she is trying to pull a
fast one on you which the commenters
were quick to point out
Chief among them the panda Tribune who
you should be following follow the panda
tribute account
got some good stuff there and the panda
tribute counters her claim the seven of
the ten deadliest cities are in
republican-run states he goes fact
10 of the top 10 deadliest U.S cities
are run by democrats so if you go down
to the mayor level
all Democrats
everyone top 10.
but AOC has turned it into well
sure the top 10 deadliest cities are all
run by democrats but what about the
governor of the state
now there's a little bit of a point
there because the governor of the state
could do something about gun laws
but
so could the states or so can the cities
right
can't the cities have their local
uh you know they can they can do mortify
cry and there's lots of stuff they can
do
so interesting
um
Bill Maher continues to do his weekly
um
Service to America
you know I I I've criticized Bill Maher
for his what I think is Trump
derangement syndrome
which I really think he has a bad case
of
uh but when he criticizes his own team
you have to take his own team meaning
left-leaning Publications in this case
he says the New York Times buried
the story about the attempted murder on
the Supreme Court Justice and said that
if somebody had come to kill a liberal
Supreme Court Justice it would be Front
Page News
now that's just fair
is it not
that is a fair
political comment that the New York
Times buried the story because it didn't
agree with their politics
and he's calling him out like in a
prominent platform
again
I I will reserve the right to disagree
with Bill Maher on a number of topics
but if there's anybody who's being more
of a patriot
like just as a Pure service to the
country
more than him right now I don't know
it'd be hard to think of somebody who's
doing more good for the country right
now than Bill Maher is so good for him
and I don't know if he's getting through
I feel like he probably does because you
know he's got an audience that finds
incredible
and should
here's what I've been waiting for
there's an article in CNN opinion piece
by Bill press
I think it's interesting that somebody
whose last name is press
works in the news business but
anyway
he's told us that the Second Amendment
is racist
how many of you knew that the Second
Amendment is a racist Amendment
and do you know why I'll tell you his
argument
damn right
why is it a racist the Second Amendment
well as Bill press informs us he says it
was added later by James Madison as part
of a deal to secure the support of
Patrick Henry and other what Bill calls
white racist Virginians
uh by the way I think that's a fair
character is a fair characterization
it's sort of jarring
to hear the the founders refer to as
white racist Virginians so when I first
read I'm like oh
like that's going too far and I thought
oh they actually own slaves you know in
many cases so yeah they were actually
literally white races
um
and apparently the second amendment was
added uh according to noted academic
Carol Anderson uh
that it was about uh having militias to
control slavery
so that the the white militias could
have the Firepower to keep the slaves in
slavery
have you ever heard that
what do you think do you think
historically that that's an accurate
I don't know I'd have to hear a
Counterpoint
but I it does sound a little bit
credible on the surface I mean I don't
know if it's true but it does sound like
maybe they did
want white militias to keep slavery
under control
what do you think now here's my second
part of my opinion it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter here here's what I
think is the weakest argument
about the Second Amendment
what did the founders intend
like we're supposed to make the decision
based on that right what did the
founders intend
but it really doesn't matter
it doesn't it matters what the Supreme
Court says and apparently the Supreme
Court can make up laws
you know they they made up a few I think
that they made up a
I believe that they made up the
um
the Roe versus Wade
you know the Privacy argument and again
I'm not arguing for it or against it so
this is not my opinion about it
it just looks like it made up
right
but I think the the Second Amendment is
close to that you know it's a different
situation but I think the Second
Amendment isn't made up right
it's a real one and I'm totally in favor
of it
but it's made up
meaning that if you're looking for what
did the founders intend
that's a good way to approach it it's
just not relevant
it won't make any difference because all
that matters is what the Supreme Court
says and apparently they could just make
 up
right now let me let me be very careful
about what I'm saying I'm not saying
this is the way it should be
if you're arguing the way it should be
is we should look at the original intent
and based on that I'd say that's a good
argument I'm not disagreed with that at
all I'm saying that the way things
should be is irrelevant
because they're not
it's just not so it doesn't matter if
you should do that
if you're not
all that matters is you're not
so if you can make stuff up
all that matters to me is if you made
something up that was good
right
so that's the only filter I put on it
I say I don't care if you made up a
right
did you do a good job why do you trust
the founders more than you trust the
Supreme Court
I don't I think the founders were flawed
people and they completely different
time they did an amazing job
but it was flawed people in a different
time if the Supreme Court are also
flawed people but you know some of the
best that we can come up with
and they're doing the best they can in
our current time
that is every bit as good to me
as what the founders tried to do for us
so I'm not saying the system should work
the way I just described it I'm just
saying it does work that way if I could
change it maybe I would
but I can't
so I'm not terribly upset by any
disconnect between why why or right or
an amendment was there and how we
interpret it today
I have no problem with that at all
in fact I think I prefer it actually I
prefer that the court
has the flexibility to take into account
modern situations
because everywhere you go is a problem
the thing that would be the dumbest and
worst thing to do is to say that because
the founders said X we should still
stick with it
I think that would be the worst thing to
do
but it's also good that there's lots of
resistance to changing original
interpretations so I like it just the
way it is
I wouldn't change anything about our
systems you want it to be really hard
to create a new right
but if you need it
and if you trust the Supreme Court as a
you know an independent ish
group of people
that's probably the best we can do
I don't have a problem with it at all
um
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen
is everything I want to talk about
I believe
did I leave anything out is there
anything I forgot
um
yeah there's a and there's also the
discussion about whether it's only
applies to
militias well-organized militias to
which I say well I don't care
I really don't care what it was
originally intended
to be about
and then other people say well you
should include the ARs or not include
the ARs to which I say I don't care what
they intended
I don't care at all
I just care what makes sense
um
the militia was every free citizen yeah
but you know that's just an argument I
don't care about
I don't care what they meant by militia
it's just not relevant to me it's 2022.
if the Supreme Court says it means a
group then it means a group if they say
it means an individual it means an
individual and that's just what it's
going to be
um
sudden adult death syndrome
I haven't seen any evidence that we're
having any sudden deaths that we didn't
normally have
I'm open to it I mean I don't rule it
out but I haven't seen any evidence of
it
all right uh 300 million guns mean they
aren't going away anytime soon
um
which means there is no Constitution
well that's a little too far
well regulated back then meant well
stocked oh is that true
that would be interesting so well
regulated militia Means A well-stocked
because they're regular
so some of you are saying yes to that
they're well regulated means well
stopped
interesting yeah again it doesn't matter
to me
because it wouldn't matter what they
intended I I would I have no interest in
what they intended I have only have an
interest in what makes sense in 2022.
that's it
in good working order
all right
all right I think we've handled all the
big questions here and again this is the
best live stream you've ever seen in
your life
Catherine says once again your knowledge
of history is zero
well Catherine everybody's knowledge of
history is zero let me let me knock you
down the peg Catherine
Catherine believes I have a poor
understanding of the history
Catherine have you been watching the
news
when the historians write the news about
January 6.
What's it gonna say
it's Benz who writes it right
but Catherine you believe that the news
that we're watching now is at least half
fake maybe you think it's on one side or
the other but you know the news that you
see now is largely fake
but you believe that history
which is written by the winners
is accurate
and you believe that historians can look
back and get into the minds of these
people and know what they thought when
we can't do that today
we don't even know what Trump is
thinking
but somehow these historians in 2022 can
go back and figure out what James
Madison was really thinking based on his
writings
it's not a thing
history is fiction
so Catherine I take your criticism as
accurate I do not have the same grasp of
fiction
that you do
the difference is I'm smart enough to
 know it
if you don't know
that you've been brainwashed by all of
your history
maybe this is when you found it out
so Catherine maybe you should get off
your high horse and learn that history
is all fake
and uh if you think you know what
anybody was thinking or why they did
anything you're a idiot
is that
is that plain enough anybody who thinks
that they can understand what people
were thinking
because they studied their history they
did a deep dive and they saw a podcast
no I'm sorry you don't know anything
about history in fact you don't know the
first thing about history which is that
it's fake
if you don't know the first thing pretty
sure you don't know the second thing
does Scott know about the Federalist
Papers
yes
and I don't care
I don't care
have I read them no and it wouldn't
matter
I feel like I'm having trouble making my
point
it doesn't matter what they said in the
past I only care what makes sense today
that's it
Catherine says yeah go with your insults
and put Downs
Catherine
who started it
can I
did not Catherine just insult my
knowledge of History
I feel like she started it am I right
I didn't start it
but if you insult me personally I will
call you a and I'll do it
in public they'll do it as often as you
want
it does cost me a few hundred dollars in
in monetization when I say that but if
you're going to be that way just be that
way just don't it just own it
um
all right
that's all for today
Catherine this doesn't sound like this
is the live stream for you
so maybe you should find some content
that's a little less challenging
and uh
it doesn't matter is not an argument yes
this
yes it is
if it doesn't matter to me
that's all I'm saying what are you going
to argue that it matters to me no
don't argue that all right that's all
for now I'll talk to you later YouTube
