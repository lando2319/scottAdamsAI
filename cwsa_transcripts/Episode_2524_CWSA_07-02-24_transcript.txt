[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization you're looking at the
picture of orange Joe
Biden uh as posted on Truth social by
Trump himself with no comment
the funniest part about this is that
Trump published it without any comment
because you don't need any it's just
Biden looking
[Laughter]
orange does Trump know how to do a
Victory lap or does he know how to do a
Victory lap the the fact that he didn't
put any words on it he just published
it it's just brilliant I mean it it's
it's trolling at the highest
level but more about
if you'd like to take this experience up
to levels that nobody can even
understand with their tiny smooth human
brains all you need for that is a cup or
mug or glass a tanker cheler Stein
canteen Jugger flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine h of
the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous zp it
happens now go
so
good my goodness the day is starting off
right well that assumes that my notes
look good and they do they do well if
you're Subs subscribing to the Dilbert
comic you might be seeing and you can
only see it on X if you subscribe or on
the Scott adams. locals.com
network if you were watching it there
you would know that today is the
naughtiest dilbur comic of all
time now I've been naughty a little bit
a few times but today it is the
naughtiest comic I've ever created but
it comes with an
explainer so you're going to learn
something today I'll just give you a
teaser have you heard in uh if you
follow AI at all you know that there's a
type of a special kind of data file
that's optimized for AI so if you wanted
your AI to look at a specific file that
you made to give you answers that would
sometimes be called a rag R
A now that's that stands for retrieval
augmented
generation if you didn't know that the
dilber comic wouldn't be funny at all
but if you did know that you would see
Dilbert's boss telling uh Dilbert uh hey
I'd like to use my AI to access my DNA
data and so Dilbert gives him the
following
advice put your DNA in a
rag well I'm not going to tell you how
it
ends but it's the naughtiest dber comic
of all time it's not that naughty
PG-13 all right ladies and gentlemen
we got the show of shows today it might
be a highlight of your life actually I
don't know if you've ever had more fun
than what you're going to have
today let's start with uh Arc investment
that's a big um I think they're uh
venture capitalist venture capitalist no
arc Arc investment anyway some big
Financial Group says that cost the
robots are already falling like crazy
and uh here's a point in history that
pretty
important this kind of blew me away I
think it might blow you away yeah Kathy
Woods is the add of that um but this
comment came from somebody else at ARC
that Amazon is now adding more robots
than human
employees Amazon is adding more
robots than
humans right
now right now that's happening so if if
you're wondering hey I wonder if
there'll ever be some kind of a a
crossover yep yep happening right
now and I do not give Financial advice
but I'd like to sort of draw a picture
of what Financial advice would look like
in the modern world some people
say that almost all of the gains in the
stock market are the top you know five
big companies and especially Nvidia and
Microsoft and Google and and apple
companies that are going to benefit
benefit from AI or
Robotics and I'm not going to give you
Financial
advice I'll just tell you what I'm doing
and then you can make your own decisions
so the way you should look at it is
don't do what I'm doing please please do
not do what I'm doing but look at my
explanation of why I'm doing it and then
compare it to what you're doing maybe
talk to a professional you know get get
your own independent
advice one of the things I I've invested
in is Tesla and it's not so much because
of the cars it's because it's going to
be a robot company really quickly um I'm
guessing Tesla would be better at
manufacturing than other people because
they're good at it and Elon especially
and building the things efficiently
seems like that's going to be the big
challenge um because the technological
stuff is largely down to just
engineering but but I think there's a
bigger play here that you haven't
noticed maybe don't you think that your
personal robot and your personal
automobile need to work
together think about it don't you want
your robot to get into your Tesla and
drive your ass around and you know have
the robot brain and the the car
basically meld you know and become one I
feel as though there are going to be a
whole bunch of situations in which
having your robot and your car made by
the same company are going to give you
some Advantage I don't know what that
would be but it's one of the things I'm
looking at anyway so my investment in
Tesla is entirely because of the
upcoming
robots um and then it made me wonder is
there a Index Fund yet for those people
who don't want to pick specific
companies because that's always a little
more dangerous uh for AI in robotics and
there are now again I'm not recommending
these this is not a recommendation I'm
simply telling you that if you're
investing in the future you need to at
least have a theory about Ai and robots
that would be the number one thing you
should be aware of and have a have your
own theory about what's going to happen
but there's a I'm going to name four
different uh index funds it mean which
Index Fund would be a collection of
stocks that are all in some specific
area so there's two of them that are in
the AI and Robotics domain and again I
don't know that they're good I'm just
saying that if you want to invest in a
basket of stocks in Ai and Robotics
there's something called
irbo um don't know anything about them
just got this from chat GP today there's
one called Bots B is and boy
otz and then I looked at the nuclear
energy industry I wanted two index funds
that have a variety of nuclear energy
things because that's going to be big
nlr it's they do uh n as in neighbor LR
uranium and nuclear stuff mostly I think
more uranium than other nuclear stuff
but uh it's a good broad
basket and another one in the same
domain would be
Ur So do what I did um you could ask AI
or Google it I guess you know what are
some index funds in nuclear power and
also in Ai and Robotics and then just do
your own research right talk to a
professional um there's a new study that
identifies the ideal number of sexual
partners according to social norms so
this is not based on science it's based
on what other people think would be
appropriate now I think they Pegg this
at sort of an age
25 uh theoretically if you were single
for your entire life and you were
sexually active you probably have a
bigger number but if you look at
somebody who's looking to settle down
someday and at age 25 what's their
number the ideal number according to
research for men would be 45 sexual
partners and for women two to three
because we're a
sexist place I guess people want
somebody who is desirable enough that
other people want to have them and maybe
they got a little bit of experience so
they know what they're doing but not too
much now I'd like to offer uh that they
could have skipped this entire research
and just asked me because if they asked
me I would said I don't know age
25 I'd say uh well from the perspective
of other people for men to be about four
or five and from the perspective of
other people you know not my opinion
specifically probably women
as few as possible but maybe more than
one so two or three so I think I could
have saved them a lot of time by just
ask me I think that one was kind of
obvious kind of
obvious all right we'll get to all the
political stuff here um Business Insider
says there might be a deflationary
spiral in cars people are delaying
purchases um so if they're not buying as
many cars cars price might come down
because of supply and demand but I don't
know how many people are in my situation
I I'm sort of at that point where I'm
looking at a new car and I talk about it
all the time because it's been over a
year I've been doing it I can't make a
move I'm
frozen and the reason
is I think electric cars of the future I
think a Tesla would be a solid thing to
own I told you I invested some money in
the company um but I don't like like how
they look I can't get past it do anybody
else have the same problem like you know
your next car probably ought to be an
electric but they all look the same they
don't look
bad but when I look at a let's say a
Ford
Bronco my my whole mind and body
go there's just a design thing that just
speaks to me like emotional
and I can't look at the Bronco and then
spend some large amount of money on
something that looks like an
egg I don't know how to do that again
I'm very Pro Tesla but their cars you
know and and I and I have to say from
the perspective of a business
decision having all the Teslas have a a
certain design you know that's not too
sexy but a little bit it's probably
exactly the right sweet spot for
business it's just I need a little
sexier or something so I'm just s sort
of
stuck apparently the number of criminals
entering the US
illegally um set a new record but we're
talking about criminals not just illegal
aliens um so for over let's see about
1,500 uh illegal aliens who are ALS Al
criminals have been
arrested uh if the trend
continues if um the record level of more
than 177,000 criminals will have been
caught crossing the border
illegally
177,000
criminals have been caught trying to
enter the the country and that's not
just criminal because they're coming in
the country that's criminal these are
people who have been caught
now as you know most crime is by people
who have done some other crime am I
right you know you have a a small number
of people who do basically 95% of the
crime because they keep doing crimes if
you brought in
177,000 criminals and you take the
theory that criminals keep doing crimes
how many actual crimes is
that
100,000 and 177,000 is just the number
number of criminals who are
caught what what about the ones who got
in without getting caught I don't know
how big that number is but are we
talking about a 100,000 crimes per year
that we just led into the country
knowingly over five years is that half a
million
crimes has anybody has anybody
calculated the number of crimes this is
going to work out to because I don't
know how you could take a half a million
crimes over 5 years and assume none of
that's going to touch you if I said
there's going to be a half a million
things happening to people in the next
five years would you think that half a
million wouldn't hit your neighborhood
or somebody you know I mean that's
getting really personal it's really hard
to imagine that immigration is somebody
else's problem isn't it I I think we've
crossed the point where it's very
clearly no matter where you are it's
your freaking problem so yeah these are
big scary numbers here's a story that
sounds familiar except it's a different
topic see if he can find the pattern
before I tell you the pattern let's see
if you can spot it there's some uh
suggestion that the Alzheimer research
which has been going on for 30 years for
reasons that weren't obvious before
didn't have nearly as much progress as
other areas of medicine for example in
30 years there's been you really big
progress in cardiovascular disease and
Cancers and all kinds of other
diseases but not so much
Alzheimer's anybody want to take a guess
why the Alzheimer's has had less less
progress well see if this sounds
familiar every time a scientist wanted
to study something that wasn't the
approved Narrative of how Alzheimer's is
caused they couldn't get published do
you know why CU they were outside the
narrative yep sound
familiar
so think about that so that they
couldn't even get published and people
would say I can't publish you because
other people wouldn't publish you or
haven't published you or you're not part
of the narrative basically you're too
outside the
norm now how many times has this
happened in science where science colle
itively had the wrong answer and
couldn't adjust because people couldn't
leave the norm there was the food
pyramid when I was a kid scientists all
said that's the truth but it wasn't it
was closer to the opposite of the truth
there was uh a number of issues in the
pandemic in which we saw the experts
telling us something that wasn't
true fairly fairly often there were
several things which the experts told us
with complete impunity
and unanimity or something like it and
just wasn't
true then uh we see the Alzheimer's res
research may have been crippled for 30
years because science doesn't know how
to deal with people outside the
narrative You could argue that the same
thing has happened with climate change
that you can't argue outside the
narrative so if there is a truth that's
outside the narrative we would be blind
to it
likewise String Theory might turn out to
be exactly the thing that unravels the
nature of the universe it might but it
doesn't look like it and I would imagine
if the you know narrative is string
theory is the thing what about the
people who don't think it's a thing do
you think they're getting lots of play
do you think their papers getting
published you think they're getting a
lot of funding I don't know but my
concern would be that we've reached a
point where it's normal
that most of the scientists will be
wrong that's weird because isn't that
opposite of your intuition the science
is you know slowly crawling toward the
truth and if you've got 97% of the
scientists on one side for
example you could feel
confident now it's feeling closer to the
opposite because 97% agreeing on
anything
scientific triggers my my pattern Rec
recognition oh wait if that many people
are on the same side that's an
indication that there's no science going
on right if you tell me scientist agree
8020 I'm going to say hm that sounds
like they've got a pretty good handle on
it but you got a good solid 20% who are
maybe looking in a different direction
and maybe they'll find something but 80%
would be pretty convincing you know
what's not
convincing 97% do you know why because
that suggests there's no science going
on look look for that pattern 80% in One
Direction maybe that's science 97% in
the same direction means they're afraid
to
talk there there's analogy to that in
the uh the Dilbert comic World it used
to be said that if you went into a
company and you saw a lot of Dilbert
comics on the cubicle walls that that
was a sign that the company
might have some issues because the
employers are kind of silently
protesting by putting up you know
anti-management dilber Comics but then
somebody noticed that there are some
companies that have Zero dilber Comics
are they the good
ones probably
not if your employees are simply not
able to even put a
mildly you know mildly disagreeable
comic on their cubico wall that's
probably a terrible place to work that
that means that dissent is not tolerated
even a little bit of humorous dissent
not tolerated so when you see something
as Extreme as 97% of scientists it could
be because something's so true that
nobody could argue with it but it is a
big red flag that no science is
happening if it's something more
controversial um raspon did a poll
Breitbart News is reporting this where
nearly half of Americans believe
corporate diversity programs Des
discriminate against white
men you idiots half of the
country are you kidding me half of the
 country doesn't know that Dei by
its design discriminates against white
men what the hell is wrong with you are
you lying half the people in the
country don't know the Dei is straight
out discrimination against white men how
the don't you know that by now
right you're an idiot if you don't know
that or you're lying I mean this is not
a matter of opinion in
2024 to to imagine that that's an
opinion good
lord well if it were true that corporate
diversity is discriminating against
white men you'd expect that that would
cause some kind of a quality degradation
in the output not because white men have
all the skills no but because if you
artificially constrain any Group which
you need a resource from the artificial
constraint should very soon work its way
into the overall workings of the system
so we should be able to see it in actual
reality if if there's any real
degradation in quality from it we'd be
able to see it which brings us to the
Supreme Court let me just say what many
of you are thinking the problem with
some of the well most of the rule ings
from the Supreme Court is that the
batshit crazy women on the Supreme
Court got all the wrong because
they're stupid why are they on
the court why is saom meer on the court
obviously it's not because she's smart
like I I'm not even a Supreme Court
Justice even I could tell she's a
 idiot now there's no way that
she's on the court because of her high
quality of decisions I mean you just
have to look at it it's just stupid from
top to bottom now you shouldn't have
Supreme Court Justices who are obviously
stupid this this is just another Joe
Biden problem that we're all ignoring oh
let's let's pretend Joe Biden is fine
until it's too late like now
same thing with the Supreme Court you've
got a idiot on there just
because of some Dei is requirement and
I'm supposed to ignore that it's like
the last defense of the whole
country and I'm supposed to ignore that
you're putting idiots on it because they
me some
category no I'm not going to ignore that
anymore it's a Dei problem with Supreme
Court that's it that's the whole
problem now of course there's politics
people do take their sides but I don't
mind when people take sides with good
arguments you know if there's a good
argument on both sides and people you
know tend to lean toward their political
bias I'd say that's kind of normal but
just to be stupid just so you can side
with your side that's not
cool and uh let's look at uh
Biden do you think that
Biden is in the situation he is with the
advice he has for any other reason than
Dei to me this is just a massive Dei
problem that he's getting bad advice
people want to keep their jobs whatever
it is he's not let let's put it this way
Biden is not getting David Axel Rod
quality advice now I'm not saying
because David Axel is an old white guy
that's not why his advice is good his
advice is good because I've been
watching him for decades and he gives
good advice that's why his advice is
good um but I think the smart people
have been frozen out by the Dei hires
and that's the whole story of why
Biden's situation is what it is and then
why is the news why are they unable to
uh report on the obious because the Dei
the Dei in the news is crippling the
news business plus Other Stuff Plus
other stuff but the is totally crippling
the news business so that they can't
even tell us what the truth
is so yes Dei has destroyed everything
that's important about America and it's
really obvious it's really obvious now
I'm not going to say it's the whole
problem because when I get when I get
double canell for saying this sometime
tomorrow the the part that they're going
to leave out is it's not the only
problem but I think it's a definitive
problem that tipped us into the
ridiculous right there there's plenty of
incompetence of you know old white guys
have lots of problems right it's not
like old white guys don't have ton
of problems and their own defects I'm
just saying that what we're seeing is
the exactly what you would expect with
Dei as a system has nothing to do with
the people if you're new to me it only
has to do with a system design in which
you artificially constrain one of the
important variables that's it that's the
whole
argument all right uh New York Times
according to Michael shellenberger I
think he he said the times with the
capital T I think that means the New
York Times in this
context um thinks that uh
Dei is what's going to take down
Biden yeah so you thought I was out a
little bit out on the limb didn't you
you're thinking oh my goodness you've
stretched that argument a little too far
no that's what the New York Times is
saying about the Biden Administration
it's a Dei problem and the way they
describe it is Dei is what got them a
black woman vice president who is
incompetent they're saying it pretty
directly now and that once you have an
incompetent vice president but also
black and female you can't pass over her
and you can't get rid of her so you're
stuck with the old white guy with no
brain that's where we're at now by the
way that's exactly your impression and
my impression what's interesting is that
the New York Times agrees with you that
it's a Dei problem now you're seeing it
everywhere you're seeing it
everywhere all right
um so also Michael shellenberger post
today on X which was uh referring to a
larger article of uh his
publication
um here he points out that uh progresses
have condemned
Republicans uh as on the having um being
on the grip of right-wing
authoritarianism all right so the
progressives have this narrative that
the people on the right are a bunch of
right-wing authoritarian people you know
practically
Nazis uh by contrast there's a
psychologists in 1980 who argued that
left-wing authoritarianism was a
myth but that turned out to be wrong so
as Shel berer points out Swiss
psychologists recently found an almost
exact overlap between dark personality
traits and social justice commitment do
you know what a dark personality trait
is narcissism would be you know part of
the dark
Triad um so basically mental illness and
the the dark part is that it's not
harmless mental illness it's
specifically the kind of mental illness
that you try to harm other people for
your own benefit a narcissist right
there are a few flavors of that but
they're all in that same category of
they're just
evil um you the evil might be because of
Mental Illness but they're evil and
they're going to screw you over as hard
as they can and Gaslight you um in order
to get what they want so there's a
perfect overlap between uh those mental
conditions and social justice
commitment and they're entitled in
narcissistic uh
Etc
now how could it be that the Democratic
party the Democrats became controlled by
the dark Triad
personalities
well most of it is
women it it's concentrated in the women
why is it that the uh the mentally
insane women have became the dominant
part of the Democrats and it's still
there and you know scientists can point
it out we can all see it how does that
persist well I have a
hypothesis the reason that the Democrat
men can't call on their own
situation is because they're too weak
and they're not enough of
them they're too weak meaning that if
they argue with the women it's not going
to go well and there aren't enough of
them do you know what they need do you
know what the poor men in the Democratic
party need to escape from their dark
Triad uh
overlords
Republicans they need some Republicans
do you know why there are no Republicans
helping
them because there's no no conversation
between Republicans and Democrats
anymore so the Democrats have made it
impossible to have even a conversation
with somebody who's a republican if
you're Democrat you can't even have a
social
interaction so they're so the poor
Democrat men are completely stranded on
the island of crazy women they're too
weak to get off on their own to get off
the
island and they don't have help from
stronger men and stronger
women who are Republican so they've cut
themselves off from any possibility of
Escape or help or being outvoted you
know so that they can outvote the bad
people so it's sort of like the
prisoners took over the Democrat Island
and the people who are there are just
totally trapped and they don't have
access to information or even allies who
could help them out they've completely
separated
themselves that's how I see it um and
specifically narcissists are
gaslighters you see and we all see that
the entire Democratic party is actually
just a gaslighting party at this point
at this point it isn't anything else
everything that they believe that's
important to them is literally made up
so they've gone from you know the fine
people hoax and the injecting bleach
hoax and the losers and and suckers hoax
to this hoax and now they're on the he's
stealing democracy the the January 6
Insurrection hoax every one of these are
the same hoax it's all gaslighting
and they didn't really realize it until
the Biden situation happened and then a
lot of Democrats said wait a minute you
all
knew you all
knew the Press knew everybody around
Biden knew you all knew the truth and
you told us he was fine that's where you
that's the sort of the uh the key that
unlocks the door so if you thought I
thought I was in a party with normal
people that's not normal there's none of
that going on in the Republican side
none and let me be clear Republicans are
up okay Republicans are really up
in a whole bunch of different ways you
know they they believe conspiracy
theories they they have
terrible strategies sometimes they have
uh they basically ignore the own you
know benefit for principle in some ways
that are crazy to me but here's what
they don't do there's not a lot of
gaslighting going on when Republicans
tell you they think something's true
it's because they think it's true
sometimes they're wrong sometimes
they're right but they think it's true I
don't know if that's what's happening on
the other side it looks to me like the
things that they tell us they believe
are so ridiculous they couldn't possibly
believe it
so it looks like gaslighting and when
they do it to us it feels like being
gaslighted or gas lit I'm not sure how
to say that
but do we have to keep
ignoring that there's basically a mental
illness gaslighting problem that we're
treating like it's some
political thing and it's not we don't
have two political parties competing for
their preferred political outcomes
nothing like that's happening we have a
bunch of mentally sick Fox who got
control of one political party and the
people who are going along for the ride
don't have the power to get off and you
got one who's who thinks it's just in
regular politics and doesn't know what
the going on because nothing
makes sense everything is just a lie or
a gasl light these are not normal
political differences this is not even
some people don't have the right facts
this is pure pure gaslighting this is
all new you know it's always been it's
always been that politics involved lying
this is not
lying gaslighting is not lying if if I
teach you one thing this is important
lying is normal Republicans lie
Independents lie Democrats lie
completely normal don't pack don't pass
the fact check totally normal but
telling you something that you saw with
your own eyes didn't happen that's
new it happened with the fine people
hoax it happens with most of them right
this is
new and it gives you mental illness when
it happens to you a narcissist can make
you mentally ill literally that's the
main thing they do narcissists make you
mentally ill so the whole whole country
is getting this infection of mental
illness from a fairly small group of
dark Triad personality narcissists who
got way too much
power that's what's really happening
it's definitely not two political
parties it's batshit crazy women who
manag to take control of one party and
here we
are
um cerovich
says uh Trump has spent over100 million
fighting false charges not including the
judgments he has to pay from the from
the cases themselves bannon's in prison
Navaro is jailed and freedom isn't free
and we are occupied by communists
um that's that's one way to frame it but
I think it misses the bigger
story I think we're occupied by marxists
who are pretending to be marxists but
are actually
narcissists I think narcissists found a
way to Rebrand themselves to make
themselves part of the political process
no I don't have a dark Triad
personality I'm more of a socialist
Marxist
so they found a place to
hide but I don't like them hiding there
so I don't want to call them Communists
or Marxist when mental illness is
clearly the larger
variable meanwhile CNN's got an
interesting situation um some of you
laughed when I said don't be surprised
if Jake Tapper goes hard at Biden for
his mental and cognitive abilities now
it did not happen during the debate
which is the context I was talking about
so my my prediction that Jake Tapper
might go hard at Biden uh wasn't true
got that wrong and indeed I think most
people including me complimented um
Tapper and Bash for a good good job um
hosting a
debate
however H having done a very
professional job in the debate then they
go back to the regular jobs and you it's
more a little bit more opinion comes out
as it should that would be natural and
uh I've noticed that Jake Tapper is
going really hard at Biden's brain now
that was the part I did predict I I
predicted that Jake wouldn't be able to
ignore it anymore and he would just take
Biden out and he is so he had on the
show um Chris Coons and he basically
just called Coons a liar to his
face thank you cuz Chris goons is a liar
on this topic which is weird because I
actually respect him as a
Democrat who in my opinion has far more
often been one of the reasonable ones
he's not one of the crazy Liars he's not
a shiff a swell you know usually when he
comes out it's because they have a real
argument but not this time this time
Chris goons went to the dark side and
he's PR pretending on TV right in front
of Jake Tapper that he has no problem
with these little glitches that Biden's
having now that's a lie it's a
transparent lie and I revise because of
it I revised my opinion of Chris Coons
uh I used to think he was actually he's
one of he would have been in the top
three Democrats I would have ever
mentioned as you know you got some
reasonable ones over there they disagree
with me maybe on policy but reasonable
people nope no he's not being a
reasonable person he's being a
 cuz if you can sit front of the
American people and lie to our faces and
Gaslight us like that now I don't think
he's a narcissist but I think he's under
the thrall of them he's got to do their
bidding so he's spreading their
gaslighting this is gaslighting this is
not lying you have to know the
difference when Jake Tapper shows him a
video of of uh Biden glitching and then
he then he gets that weird
smile chrisin wheel spot I don't see any
problem with it we look at my weird
smile my eyes are practically closed my
face can't even control the lie I can't
even control my face while I lie it was
painful to watch when he lies in front
of you that obviously that's not lying
that's something else and it's dangerous
whatever that
is so to uh Jake tapper's credit uh he
hammered him pretty hard and he said to
his face it is not honest
good job
Jake that is what I as a viewer wanted
to see I wanted you to look in his face
while he sat next to you he wasn't even
on video sitting right next to him
looked right at him and said that's not
honest
exactly now that's that's what I want to
say now am I complimenting CNN nope
because his coworker uh Abby Phillip I
noticed has gone full sha Hannity and is
completely lost any sense of objectivity
and almost every word out of her mouth
was Baghdad Bob propaganda so
you've got this interesting situation as
CNN I don't know how management is
handling it because you've got one
completely honest reasonable person
who's trying to help his viewers
understand what's real that Chris goons
is lying to you right now that's real
and that be fill up completely different
page that absolutely pure brainwashing
propaganda how does management handle
that they should get rid of her if
they're trying to find the middle um
advice to CNN get rid of Abby Phillip
she she's one of the fine people
hoaxers yeah she's not helping your
she's she's not helping at
all all right um here's my favorite
story of the day there's a scientist
who's suggesting that the problem with
Biden's brain wa for it this is a good
one that the real problem with Biden's
brain is not
dementia uh could be damaged from
Russia's secret Sonic
weapon that they've been using on the
embassies he says which of course is not
true and has never happened but I was so
impressed that there was somebody in the
news who could find a way to blame
Biden's brain deterior iation
on
Putin there there's actually somebody
who made it Russia's
problem do you do you notice any
pattern have you seen the
pattern oh I've got a
hangnail
Putin looks like it's cloudy today
Russia
Russia yeah we noticed we noticed the
pattern well let's talk about
presidential immunity the Supreme Court
rule we'll talk about that a little bit
but uh Biden gave a 4minute uh I don't
know what you call it um a clever wag on
the locals
platform called it the cuckoo clock um
press
briefing see you now a cuckoo clock
works the the little doors open and the
cuckoo clock and then the little cuckoo
Bird Go comes out goes gooo gooo and
then goes right back in and the little
doors
Clos that's what Biden did there the two
big brown doors and they open Biden
comes down by himself spends four
minutes talking cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo and
it goes right back with no no answering
no questions it's the cuckoo clock we
got a cuckoo clock president can't
answer questions can't talk for more
than four minutes unless he's reading it
and that's normal
Let's Pretend that's
normal that's not
normal all right but here's the funniest
part uh that I mentioned if you joined
the show at the beginning uh that Biden
was apparently way makeup more than
normal probably in response to the fact
that he looked pale and deathly at the
debate so they gave him a good few
layers of
makeup that uh turned him orange turned
him
orange
so uh and then Trump trump posted on
true social just a picture of his big
face looking orange and
stupid I just love the fact that he
didn't need any words to sell that Meme
oh my God that's
funny all right over on MSNBC they had a
legal analyst on who um told them what
they certainly didn't want to hear he
thought that the decision from the
Supreme Court that basically says that
if the president's doing uh official
president business that he's got lots of
immunity from Criminal prosecution but
if it's not in the if it's not an
official act then he he'd be as exposed
as anybody else now that seems to be a
strengthening of what would a historical
situation we always thought Presidents
had a little more you know a little more
wiggle room than other people Obama
using a drone to kill an American
overseas for example you know so so
we've always just assumed they had extra
wiggle room or as I like to say Above
the
Law now when I thought that Obama was
acting like he was above the law did I
mind no not much no because to me it
looked like he was doing something in
his official capacity maybe you could
argue he shouldn't done it but it looked
like he was doing it for the benefit of
you know the country the military so I
didn't have a problem with it all so
just to be clear do I think some
Americans are above the law yes and do I
think it's always
bad depends I think the presidency and
and that includes Biden by the way not
just Trump but I think the
President should have a little extra
little extra leeway I'm totally good
with that now is that an example of no
one being Above the Law no not really
that's a case of the office being Above
the Law that's how I it it's not a case
of Obama was above the law it was a case
that the office was and I was okay with
that as long as it was you know directed
in my benefit or even allegedly to my
benefit that'd be fine so but now it's
uh let's say a little bit more
legitimized by the court with more
clarity so one of msnbc's legal analyst
um told them what they didn't want to
hear that the decision was logical and
makes
sense and that uh we should avoid
rejecting that decision just because
it's about Trump he says don't don't
look at it through a trump lens if you
just look at it in a non-trump lens
actually made sense it was a good clean
decision that cleared up a lot
apparently some say I'm I'm no expert
here uh but Eric
Holder uh had a different opinion now he
would be ex attorney general right so he
said our democracy has been Gravely
wounded
huh um he said the Trump immunity
decision says the president can violate
a criminal law if he acts within his
broadly defined constitutional Authority
this is absurd and dangerous
and there's there's no basis in the
Constitution for this court constructed
monstrosity so I guess Democrats don't
like activist
courts that seems like the opposite of
what they always said before um so of
course I'm no expert and when I hear uh
a lot of the people like Sodom Meer say
stuff like well I guess the president
can order SEAL Team Six to kill his
opponent
do you think that's
true um based on what the news told you
okay based on the news or your own
opinions do you think that a president
could order SEAL Team Six to kill a
candidate who's running against him and
that uh that would work out and he would
just retire in peace and people would
say man I wish he hadn't killed that guy
but you know the Office of the President
it's above the law we're good with it
now
I didn't have to be a legal scholar to
know that wasn't
true no I didn't need to be did you you
most of you are not legal Scholars did
you need a legal scholar to tell you you
know that's probably not true that if a
president killed somebody that the
Supreme Court says they can just you
know as long as they sort of
semiofficial
it's
okay no that's not true so I asked chat
GPT to
clarify what sort of things would a
president still be uh in big trouble for
and not have immunity for um even under
this new Supreme Court interpretation
and the answer is long so there first of
all the president can be impeached right
so you can be impeached so but still
even impeachment would not make you
criminally
liable if you could argue that during
the presidency it was part of your
job even even with impeachment but
impeachment exists just just it's not
nothing but here are the examples where
the uh the president could be prosecuted
in just any normal way even if he argued
that it was in the
uh that it was in the U course of doing
his job so if the president obstructed
Justice there would be no
immunity so for example if if there was
some legal process going on and the
president closed it down for just you
know naked political reasons nobody's
going to say well presidents can do that
so I guess you can obstruct Justice no
the president isn't allowed to obstruct
Justice not allowed to um but other
things according to chat GPT you should
do a fact check on this by the way so
I'm not saying chat GPT is correct but
just as a reference point so things that
uh a president would still be in big
trouble for would be obstruction of
justice bribery perjury Financial or
other fraud embezzlement Espionage
witness tempering conspiracy moning
laundering obstruction of Congress
murder of an opponent conspiracy to
commit murder conspiracy to commit
murder abuse of
power um so basically there is no
scenario and which a president can kill
his opponent just to kill his opponent
now you might say to me but Scott
they're going to find a clever way
around it well
sure but it's going to be kind of
transparent so I don't know if they get
away with it what what would be the
argument that that um that Biden could
kill
Trump what would be the argument for
that like how in the world would he get
away with
that crazy stuff anyway so
um lot of lying going on there and I
would call it
gaslighting if if the Supreme Court um
and the experts who can understand the
Supreme Court say no it is not true that
the president can murder his opponent
but then
somebody who's a prominent member of the
democratic party says it's true the
court says he can murder his
opponent that's
gaslighting because it's not a normal
lie it's a lie where you can see right
in front of you that that's not true
because you can turn on the TV and have
a supreme court scholar say no that's
not true they didn't rule that and they
probably all will say that but then
you're going to turn to Joy Reed and
she's going to tell you well now the
president can murder his his opponent
that's gaslighting because you could see
with your own eyes that the experts are
say no you can't do that and then you
turn the channel and she'll say oh you
could talk toally do that even when you
know you can't well you should know
it all right here's a case of no the
players remember I tell you that if the
only thing you did is watch the news you
wouldn't know what's going on you have
to know who is in the news and who
they're connected to and what their
pattern is and then you know let me give
you some
examples uh haven't heard from Adam
Schiff lately have
you do you know why he comes out
Adam Schiff comes out when you need to
tell a big lie he's not the little lie
guy because the regular people can take
care of that the small lies you know the
little exaggerations the hyperbole the
you know arguing about what the the
inflation rate is that's the little
stuff so the regular normal politicians
and pundits do the little stuff but when
they need a big one like a big lie like
a really good gaslighting big lie they
bring out Adam
shiff every time here he is right on
schedule and he's saying that uh uh well
basically he's saying that the uh
presidential immunity lets the president
do everything and it's a it's a
violation of the Constitution and
basically everything that's untrue if he
just took the opposite of everything
that shift says about this you would
find the truth now if you didn't know
that and you were just a casual viewer
you turn on the news and you see this
guy who's been elected a number of times
saying that the Supreme Court got it
wrong and you know people will be
murdering their
opponents you would find that convincing
wouldn't
you the only thing that makes it not
convincing if you were to see it that in
a context of other people's opinions is
that you know it's Adam Schiff they only
bring him out for the big lies otherwise
you never see him have you ever seen him
him say anything that was true you know
just come out and talk about the news oh
thing happened today no no he doesn't do
normal hyperbole he only comes out when
they got a big one here it is so this is
signaling that this is the big hoax this
could be I think they're still searching
for the big summer hoax but this might
be it the summer hoax they will actually
convince their their public the
Democrats that because they've already
convinced them that Trump is
Hitler and now they're going to convince
him that we've given Hitler total power
to murder people that's actually the
gaslighting that they're planning to do
to their
voters that Trump is Hiller and he just
got full power because the Supreme Court
that he he appointed the majority uh
they just gave it to him so basically
gave it to himself by appointing that
majority wow so that's the world so I
feel sorry for the Democrats CU they're
the Democrats are living
in what year was it
1939 Germany or something where their
actual experience is that Hitler just
Rose to power and took uh complete
power that's actually what they wake up
to nothing like that's happening in fact
it's you know it's literally the
opposite but that's what that's the
world they're going to live in how do
you think you would ever penetrate that
world how could you ever talk anybody
out of any of that because they have no
contact with
Republicans here here's the thing I I
said this before but let me say it in a
in in a let's say a stickier
way in the old days Republicans and
Democrats would go to the same party I
don't even think that happens the same
dinner party cu the host would say I
can't have these people sitting at the
same table it's going to it's going to
be a fight but in the old days it was it
didn't even come up I don't think
anybody really much talked politics you
know it's hard to avoid now but if you
had lots of casual contact with normal
people who thought that Trump was
normal don't you think that'd
help just seeing normal people who are
not afraid of them but imagine if every
person you talk to about Trump was
shaking with fear
how could you not be affected by that if
you thought everybody was literally
shaking the first time I saw this was
2016 I was at a restaurant and there was
a table near me where I could hear what
they were saying and there was a woman
who was talking about Trump and the the
fear she had and her body was
shaking her body was shaking in a public
place just talking about him because she
was so so
afraid and I thought you look like some
of who doesn't have contact with any
Republicans because your sympathetic
nervous system you know the the way that
were influenced by our contacts with
other people would certainly be calmed
down if you spend a few minutes with
people who know that Hitler did not rise
and the Hitler did not take over the
country and by the way the first four
years were pretty
ordinary so I think the social contact
between Republicans and Democrats
strands Democrats in a poor mental
health situation because they're they
can't escape the
gaslighting um AOC being her AOC self
thinks that uh if things don't go her
way she needs to impeach the entire
Supreme Court so that's her plan does
that sound like a normal political
opinion or something closer to a dark
Triad personality
trait because she's this new Young
member of
Congress and she thinks it's her job to
get rid of the Supreme
Court does that sound like normal
politics or some kind of mental
illness I know that's a gray area but
you you
decide all right uh guess Trump's using
the new ruling about immunity to try to
overturn
what some are calling the Manhattan case
or the St me Daniels case um now here's
the thing the the activities that were
the subject of the trial happened when
he was not president so that stuff is
not covered by immunity but here's the
interesting part some of the evidence
that was presented in the case about
something that happened before he was
president included some facts that were
apparently according to the case that
happened while he was President so there
must been some communication or
something while he was president that
may have confirmed what they thought
about before he was president now you
might say to yourself well that seems
fine because it's just adding
information to what you know before he
was president so why why would that even
be relevant but apparently the Supreme
Court was specific that you can't even
use evidence from when a person was
president
which even I would say feels a little
bit
extreme I I think if Democrats found
that part sketchy I'd have to say I'm
going to listen to that
argument that you can't even use
evidence from when they were president
to confirm that they committed a crime
when they weren't president and had
never been elected yet I don't know does
that feel right to
you I guess I like that it's so clear
but I don't know that that doesn't feel
right to me so if if Democrats wanted to
complain about that I'd say well I'll
listen to that complaint that doesn't
seem
crazy but I can also see why if I were a
lawyer I would have a much more nuanced
and smart opinion about it and I feel
like if I were a lawyer I'd be saying
yeah you have to do that you know other
oh well actually here's an argument uh
maybe you have to do it so that the
president isn't always being forced to
testify
you know you could Peck a president to
death making him give up information
about what happened before he was
president he or she so okay all right I
suppose that would be the argument
something like that I'm just guessing I
don't know but feels like that might be
the
argument all right so I don't know that
Trump will prevail in that I would guess
he won't but um it might delay it so it
might delay sentencing until it all goes
away after he's president
and then there's the uh uh
January obstruction case that's when we
think that case will keep going and uh
Jeffrey tubin was on CNN saying that uh
yeah he thinks that case might get
yanked okay you knew I was going to do
it don't act
surprised don't act surprised you heard
me say tubin you knew I wasn't going to
let it alone so to speak
so it looks like as tubin says a big
victory for Trump and at minimum
everything will be
delayed so it looks like Trump's going
to have something like a clean sweep
meaning that um nothing in the
lawfare will prevent him from being
president I don't know how much it will
linger but it looks like it's not going
to stop him from being president there
something else might but not that uh
Biden says that they're they've got some
polls are circulating showing that his
polling didn't change after the uh
debate
really
really the the uh his approval didn't
change after they saw he didn't have a
brain apparently the brain was
optional no I don't believe that that
sounds like a fake poll to
me uh
now countering that there's a New
Hampshire poll that shows that Trump
ended up ahead of Biden by there's a 12o
swing in New Hampshire in favor of H
Trump so he's now ahead where I think he
would normally be expected to be
behind all right here's another know the
players know the players uh when was the
last time you saw one of those Watergate
guys on TV you Bernstein and I can never
remember the other ones who's the other
one Bernstein and anyway they they drag
those guys
out when
uh you know when there's something
important so there they're sort of like
the uh pundits under glass you bring
them out just to say that something that
Trump did is worse than the
Watergate but in this case Carl
Bernstein went on CNN and said that
based on you know his reporting and
talking to people close to the
presidency that there have been 15 to 20
occasions where Trump where Biden has
glitched out and looked like he just
wasn't there sort of like the debate 15
to 20 times and that there there's been
an
ongoing a lot of people noticing donors
insiders well understood by the entire
ins every Insider knew it a lot of
people who saw in person knew it
um and the 15 to 20 observations are
just the ones in public well I guess
some of them saw behind but imagine how
many there were that we didn't hear
about if reporting can kick up 15 to 20
over let's say the course of the last
year or six months how many were there
probably every night probably every
night he was you know completely out of
it so even Carl Bernstein and even CNN
are completely throwing Bri Biden under
the bus because they're not buying at
all the it was a one-off bad night if
CNN were trying to back Biden they would
be backing The Narrative that well it
could be just one night maybe he'll be
fine but they're not they're definitely
not backing The
Narrative and now imagine if if
observers saw 15 to 20 occasions of
Biden's brain breaking how many has Jill
seen
imagine how what Jill has seen and keeps
him in the
race yeah now you say it's elder abuse
and I could certainly see that argument
but I wonder if it's narcissism I wonder
if it's the dark Triad because it feels
to me that what's missing here is
empathy and what's here is
gaslighting what what does that a signal
so's see you've got a woman so that's
your first in
she's gaslighting the world about
something that we can all see who does
that who gaslights you on something you
could see with your own eyes as Jake
Tapper says Hear with your own ears and
still tells you it's not happening while
you're looking right at it only
narcissists that's not
political only narcissists do
that yeah
so so and and also the other symbol the
other signal for narcissist is a lack of
empathy what are all of us saying about
how Jill is treating her
husband it looks like just a crazy lack
of
empathy like it doesn't seem like spouse
Behavior at all it looks crazy the lack
of empathy because an empath somebody
with empathy would have shot him down
and try to preserve what's left of his
legacy if anything um so no so if you
have no empathy you're gaslighting us
right in front of
us why not just say it's the
obvious why are we saying that's
political or she likes the Limelight
well well people say she likes the
Limelight but that would also be a
narcissist wouldn't it so basically
every hint we're getting is some kind of
narcissist dark Triad personality
problem that we're calling politics
again every time you call this politics
you're on the wrong page this isn't
politics this is gaslighting and it's
dark Triad behavior and we're the
victims that's what's
happening um Carl Bernstein even said
that at one point um Biden was giving a
talk and rigger mortis said in he got so
stiff that they had to bring a chair and
have him finish in the
chair and and Bernstein is telling
Anderson Cooper this stuff and Anderson
Cooper had to pretend that he didn't
know all
along
now uh I would like to nominate Anderson
Cooper for an Academy Award for the best
act on television of pretending you
didn't know for five years
Anderson Cooper you lying piece of
 now Anderson Cooper I don't think
is being driven by narcissism in this
situation I don't know probably just
political or lying you know something
ordinary because he obviously knew they
all
knew Simone Sanders um political
advisor um she says that uh the way to
fix things is Biden should go to town
halls and answer more
questions okay she so she thinks the
answer here is Biden should go out more
and do more town halls and spontaneously
answer
questions
so how stupid is
that I can't even tell if she's running
a a prank is that a
prank it doesn't sound even like it's
even real do you know what it is when
somebody says something that looks like
it could be a lie but it's so absurd
because you can see the truth right in
front of you gaslighting it's
gaslighting yeah
you know that's not the right answer you
know that putting in front of the public
more is definitely the wrong
answer but why is this political expert
saying it's the right answer besides
gaslighting do you
remember I want you to think back put
your your historical hat on can you
remember a time when I would be mocked
mercilessly in public for acting like I
knew more than an expert in some field
or
another anybody have a memory of that
I've done a lot it's kind of a cocky
thing to do maybe uh maybe it's because
I'm a narcissist
myself but on a number of occasions I've
told you yeah the experts are saying
this but I'm telling you the experts are
wrong and you all said the same thing oh
God that is so cringy
he has no expertise he's a cartoonist
and he thinks he knows more than the
scientists more than the political
experts more than the
lawyers I mean that's that's just
insane feels like a long time ago
doesn't
it let let me give you a little update
of Scott versus the experts and you can
play too you can play you versus is the
experts let's see how you
did um let's
see um did you spot Biden's mental
decline before the White House
doctor I'll betet you did I'll bet you
did isn't the White House doctor the
ultimate expert went to medical school
must have been a good one to be the
White House Doctor White House doctor is
the closest to the information best
information and also the most
expertise and you you narcissist you
thought you knew more than the the White
House doctor why do you think you know
more than the
experts it's because you
did now we don't know why the White
House doctor had the wrong answer and
every one of you had the right answer we
don't know why he might be incompetent
he might be stupid he might be gas lit
maybe bribed blackmailed I don't know no
idea
all I know for sure is you got the right
answer you know you did but the expert
didn't and then you looked at Simone
Sanders political expert very
experienced you know one of the top
rated uh political experts on the
Democrat side and you just watched her
give the worst
advice maybe in the history of political
advice did you say to yourself I know
that's the wrong answer you did didn't
you every one of you said I know that's
the wrong answer you don't want to put
Biden out there answering
questions did you or did you not beat
the expert you did you're two for two
you beat the White House doctor and you
beat one of the top Democrat um
political analysts so good for you two
for
two um when Eric Holder did his legal
analysis and some of the other experts
and told you that the president and
maybe Soder too uh told you that the
president would be able to order SEAL
Team Six to kill his opponent what did
you say did you say huh a Supreme Court
Justice sodomy is saying that he could
kill his political opponent and get away
with it now did you say that's probably
true or did you say well I don't know
much about the law but I know that's not
true I did I said that I'm no legal
expert but did I beat a Supreme Court
Justice yes I did unambiguously my
opinion on this one question was better
than a Supreme Court Justice and I will
die in that Hill it's it was
better because of course he would be
prosecuted for murdering his opponent
even if Justice Soder says no now I
think that most of you got that one
right am I right so are you three for
three you beat the the expert White
House doctor you beat the best political
analyst the Democrats have and now
you've beat a Supreme Court
Justice you are amazing have I ever told
you how proud I am of you I'm so proud
of
you and
uh how about the professional press
you know they're not like you you you
unwashed masses no these are people who
studied journalism they've been
practicing it for years and only the
best of the best you know reach these
good jobs in the New York Times and the
CNN so you wouldn't want to be such a
narcissist that you think like you could
report better you know understand the
news better than the
professionals
right except that all of these
professionals at least on the
left didn't notice the fine people
hoax and they didn't notice that Biden's
mental health was
declining but you got both of them
didn't you tell you come on don't be
modest don't be modest don't be modest
you knew the five people hoax was was
fake news didn't you you did you knew
that and and you
knew that Biden's brain had been shot
for a long
time so good for you so you beat the
White House doctor a Supreme Court
Justice uh you beat the scientists you
beat oh we haven't gotten to the
scientists
yet when the scientist told you to wear
masks to beat the
pandemic told you uh horse D warmer
would be bad for
you told you that those vaccines would
stop you from getting it and that they
were totally safe what did you say well
we won't get into all the details but
I'm going to say because I trust you
I'll bet you got those answers right
more often than the
experts am I right does any anybody want
to raise their hand and say yeah you
know honestly all things considered I
beat the experts did he you I'll bet you
did CU you're a smart and wise and
Spunky group I think you beat the
experts how about climate
change well we don't have we don't have
a final judgment on climate change do we
because uh 97% of the experts say it's
real what do you say do you say
something
like I don't think they can measure the
temperature temperature of the earth
especially with the heat island problem
and I'm pretty sure there's no such
thing as predicting the future with
multivariable
models that's what I say and if I say
that the models are really transparently
obvious
 even if even if the planet is
getting warmer and it's somewhat caused
by people it still means that the that's
unrelated to the question of whether the
models are they're complete
 of course they are we can't do
that you can't measure the temperature
of the earth everywhere to the the
Precision that you need their
predictions have all been so
far
so did you be science when it came to
climate change in your opinion did you
beat the experts yes you beat the
political experts the medical experts
you beat the Press uh you beat
uh uh the Supreme Court
Justice and uh science all over the
place you beat it like
crazy now can we make an
agreement that the next time I doubt the
experts just call it a
tie your starting assumption should be
well it's you know before I know more at
least it's possible he's beating the
experts because you do it every day you
you individually are beating the experts
on a regular basis we all are this it's
now so common that it's nothing to brag
about it's become easy so yeah experts
are well there's a new story
that uh um Trump had some phone calls to
Epstein we don't know what the subject
of the phone calls were he was single at
the time so people are saying you
something there but I don't know if this
is any new news because we were already
aware that um there was a brief time
when they knew each other and Epstein
had been at maralago but then something
happened where Trump figured out what
was going on and excommunicated him so
you can make something out of it but
there's not any real new information
because we knew they had some contacts
during that time nothing
new all right ladies and gentlemen
um that concludes my prepared
comments I hope that didn't distress you
too
much if you I'll remind you if you want
to see the naughtiest Dilbert comic of
all time it's the one today but you'd
have to be a subscriber on X or locals
to see it and uh thanks for joining
YouTube and Rumble and X platforms I'm
going to say bye to you guys and I'm
going to stick with the uh locals my
beloved locals subscribers for a little
bit and thanks for joining I enjoy every
morning I really do yeah this is the
only thing I've ever done that you could
argue is work that I just look so
forward to doing every day it's a pretty
good deal bye for
now all right let's hit the right button
uh oh I think I hit the wrong button now
it won't work maybe it
will nope
oh
no all right I found a bug in the rumble
Studio that I thought I saw before so
here here's the here's the problem it's
part of human
error um I I hit the wrong button but
then I backed out so it didn't take any
effect and then I hit the right button
when you hit the right button you can't
do it anymore after you've hit the wrong
button and back out so even though the
wrong button didn't execute anything it
put me in some kind of mode that a bug
in the rumble studio so I don't have the
option uh I thought I'd seen that
pattern before it's a weird pattern
that's hard to check if if you're
checking your own software one of the
things you don't do is click a totally
wrong button and then back out and then
go over and click the right button like
it wouldn't occur to you to even test
that because they're different buttons
like why would you even test that uh but
I've seen the pattern now so if you're a
rumble developer do this hit the end
stream
button but then don't confirm you know
back out don't actually confirm the end
and then hit the button that um will
subtract everything but the rumble and
uh and locals people if you do it in
that order it bugs and then you can't
actually uh limit it to the locals
people anyway um but let me say that the
rumble studio is a Marvel of technical
Brilliance and um you know it's new so
you can get a little bugs but my God is
it great um I it's the product I've been
waiting for for five or 10 years it does
everything I wanted to do uh couple bugs
fixed and it will be amazing so pretty
normal stuff anyway I'm going to say bye
to
everybody uh because those are my only
options now with where the interface is
so bye to everybody I think I have to
wait 20 seconds so that the locals
people don't get cut
off so now I'm just stalling and you
should probably just say goodbye if you
can hear me but in theory this part will
get cut off so nobody should hear it but
maybe some people will hear it and some
won't and the stream won't end all right
so that didn't work either so the stream
won't end which means that I have to
delete all the live streams on the on
their
destinations so um if you didn't see the
show you probably won't because this
particular bug will keep the other shows
live forever they can't be I can't cut
them out um so if there is a I'll look
I'll try to kill them but they'll
they'll either run forever or I'll have
to delete
them yeah the end end stream just
doesn't doesn't
work all right I'm going to just cut
shut down the application and then try
to kill stuff nor manually if I
can
