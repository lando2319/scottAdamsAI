that's a terrible
tattoo
mama did you just
disappear when I tap my when I tap my
papers did the picture just disappear
cuz it it threw me out of the app
how could everything go wrong how's that
even possible that all I did was
this I I won't do it
again and it turned off the
app this is so beyond this is so beyond
possible I mean we're into some
statistical impossible situation here it
can't be that all the apps died at the
same time they couldn't all be broken at
once could they I know there's a massive
incompetence problem
but that's pretty impressive
anyway if you'd like to take your
experience
today up to levels that nobody can even
understand with their tiny shiny human
brain none of it makes sense today does
it like the the Preamble doesn't make
any sense be because the uh the starting
assumption is that things went right so
the Preamble doesn't make sense let's
just do the let's just do this
side Let's Just Surrender shall we
surrender to the fact that everything's
just going to go wrong today just
absolutely everything's going to go
wrong sip to that sometimes it goes that
way ah
and then he is slap happy it's up
172% since I told you about
it anyway all right let's talk about
some of the news you ready for
this and let's try for the fourth time
in a row to push one freaking
button okay I'm going to use my finger
which I know is a human finger I'm
positive I'm still alive and I'm going
to push the button which I've pushed now
five times once it worked all
right careful careful push the
icon
yes yes I pushed the button and it did
what it was supposed to first time
today all
right did you know there's a
breakthrough in
Fusion nobody
cares uh General
atomics they they figured out how to get
20% higher than the green wall limit the
Greenwald limit which you all know about
of course it's uh some kind of limit
that the fusion people needed to get
past and they got past it it was
considered difficult or impossible but
they did and they've also figured out to
stabilize the plasma now the thing with
the
fusion is it's it might be another 20
years of there's another breakthrough
without actually anything breaking
through but uh once it gets serious it's
all going to happen at once now isn't it
weird that that Fusion is coming which
would lower the cost of energy to zero
over time um at exactly the time we need
cheap energy and relief from
inflation have you noticed that we have
a number of timing things happening that
are weird meaning that all right we're
heading toward Doom with our debt and
our expenses and nobody can live but at
the same time if Fusion were a little
bit faster it would save us but it might
it might just be late by 20 years I mean
over the if you look at the history of
humankind missing it by 20
years that would be the slightest
slightest Miss but we have other timing
too too um so you know the AI people at
open AI think that we're on the verge of
being able to solve all of our cancers
and diseases because AI will figure out
some pattern recognition and figure out
how to do it what about the people who
have terminal cancer this
year they might miss the cure for all
cancers by a
month now it's bad enough if you you
have to die from cancer at all but think
how dumb you would feel if you died a
month before all cancer is cured that's
going to happen it's like somebody's
family member is going to die a month
before all cancer is
cured I don't know if that's a year from
now but that's what the AI people say
could be a year from now meanwhile NASA
is testing a nuclear
propulsion to go to Mars in 45 days so
currently it's 6 months I think that
would lower from 6 months to 45 days
that would be a pretty big deal and
they've um what else they
got oh I saw a quote from nval Rob he
was on Tim Ferris podcast and he said
that people who don't homeschool their
lives
suck and then they described why totally
right if anybody has had kids in the
last say last 20 years you know that the
life of the parents is essentially
destroyed by school because the school
you know loads them up with homework so
you can't have any quality time at night
but you got to get up and you've got
this stress of getting them there the
traffic and the you know everything's
tense tense getting the kids to school
if you drive them especially it's tense
and it's just
brutal but if you
homeschool you kind of make your own
schedule and everything's fine and they
perform better and they don't get
damaged by the school yeah I if you just
if you're just a regular parent with
children in
school you've got a tough life and
there's no reason for it there's no
reason for it at all because you can
homeschool and you can solve all those
problems well Mr Beast Mr Beast the uh
gigantic YouTube Star says he want he
wants to get some billionaires together
and by Tik Tock he's already talked to
his billionaires and he's pretty serious
about it he says we mean business you
know having Mr Beast and his advisors or
or his investors having them own Tik Tok
that would be pretty good as long as we
can solve the you know the privacy and
the the influence part of it so that's
interesting um president Trump has his
diet coke button back in the Oval Office
have you seen it it's like this you know
nice block of wood with one button on it
to order a Diet
Coke except I feel like he needs more
buttons don't you like I'd like to see a
trap door button where he could inviting
the top Dei director for every
government
organization so what's your job I'm the
DI
director
next what's your job well I'm the
director of
De and the Diet Coke please beep and
then you get it mixed up and you want to
Diet Coke and you know next thing you
know next thing you
know next thing you know rubo going
through the trapo oh sorry I I meant to
hit the The Diet Coke
but my
bad all
right well according to Christopher rufo
who you know was working very hard on
getting rid of Dei Ridiculousness in the
corporate world and elsewhere and uh he
says that the tech executives are
telling him that in the Silicon Valley
companies uh they respect Trump's ban on
Dei they respect
it and uh many feel relieved that they
don't they don't have to enforce it
anymore they don't have to protect and
so rufo says
resistance um to
Dei is basically
dead now does that surprise you are you
surprised that Dei could die that
easily I'm
not because I was well aware that the
main promoters of Dei tended to be rich
white guys who were just protecting
themselves so as soon as somebody said I
will hurt you more if you do it
then you don't do it then all the people
who were only doing it to avoid getting
hurt would say wait well hold on what
did you say oh oh it's going to hurt me
more to keep doing it oh then I won't do
it there there was never any
intellectual agreement it was purely
just a bunch of rich white guys covering
their ass pretending like they cared
they didn't
care they were just waiting for some
good reason not to do it Trump gave it
to them
meanwhile uh this is funny The Daily
Mail is
reporting and and I don't know if you
could trust this story if this story
were about Trump I would tell you
there's no way this is true but since
this it's about uh Jim aasta uh I'm
going to recreationally pretend it's
true now I think I've explained before
that a recreational belief is one that
doesn't really have a lot of credibility
but it would be fun if it were true
certainly would be fun yeah this is one
of those so as you know Jim aasta his
time slot is going to get moved from
10:00 a.m. to midnight which is widely
interpreted as you know he's being
minimized and CNN wants to you know
maybe encourage him to leave on his own
you know what I
mean uh but the story from Daily Mail is
that uh uh Jim aosta is reportedly
considering leaving the network you know
because of the shift of the bad time
slot and but the move comes as CNN is
slashing 200
jobs um now let me give some advice to
Jim Masta if he's telling people that
he's considering leaving the
network that would be sort of a
negotiating wouldn't you say he's sort
of negotiating with management oh if you
move my time slot I might I might quit
well let me give you some negotiating
advice Jim aosta and this is free this
is free there's there's no charged for
this
um if your company is trying desperately
to cut costs and they've already decided
that you need to move to midnight that's
not really the time to start threatening
them that you might
quit because that's exactly what they
want
obviously they want him to quit he must
be one of the more High highly paid
people he's not helping the network at
all and you know they showed it by
moving him to midnight no I wouldn't
negotiate under those
circumstances uh the good news is is
sucking at your job finally matters
again so there's that um but don't worry
about Jim AA he can always follow the
path of uh Tucker Carlson who left Fox
News and just got bigger got
bigger or he could follow the model of
Don Lemon who left his prime time show
and uh now he's
uh
doing nothing I don't know I don't think
Don Lemon worked it
out well the Oscar nominations are out
um and the only thing the Oscar
nominations for the the best movie The
only thing it tells me is movies don't
seem like a thing anymore do
they doesn't it seem
like just watching a movie doesn't feel
like a thing I do anymore there isn't a
single movie on the list I have even a
little bit of interest in i i Tred to
watch uh you know you know my story I
turn off any
movie as soon as somebody's tied to a
chair if your plot of your movie just
absolutely requires somebody to be tied
to a chair
you're just signaling you don't know how
to write it can't be true that everybody
always has to be tied to a chair no
matter what the movie is about it just
can't be true that your plot requires it
there there's no way you can't tie them
to a bed once you can't tie them to a
well sometimes they'll tie them to a
pole I guess so if they want to get
creative but now as soon as somebody's
tied to a chair I'm out so I tried to
watch a a
minseries on Prime Prime video called
the agency about the CIA now it's
fiction and characters were good and you
I kind of like the tone of it and the
writing seemed good and I got through
the first episode yesterday while I was
working second episode comes on and man
tied to a chair and that's the last I'll
ever watch of it uh I'm serious about
this if you tie somebody to a chair I'm
not going to watch that's the that's the
end of my viewing for that you have to
you got to come up with something better
than tying somebody to a chair all right
it's
2025 you can do
better meanwhile Oprah discovered that
Free Will is not a thing she didn't say
it that way what she said was that when
she got an
OIC um she understood thin people now
I'm not saying she's thin and she's not
saying she's thin
but it gave her an Insight because once
she got an O epic um apparently it it
changed her her thoughts about food
because when your body is less craving I
guess your mind is relaxed as well so
she
realized that thin people don't obsess
about food all the time like she
did you realize that's realizing that
there's no free will right so she
realized that her brain was just
different and her chemistry was
different and whatever her brain and
chemistry were designed to do well what
they were doing was obsessing about food
and that made it difficult for not to
eat too much now uh and then when she
took abmic she stopped obsessing about
it and then suddenly it was easy not to
eat too much well this is what I've been
telling people
forever um I discovered this with the
kids having sleepovers in the house and
having all their friends over and if I
got pizza
I put the pizza down and the kids no
matter how many of them there were would
appear to actually get a piece of pizza
because you know they they were always
busy doing something but they would
arrive at the food in the exact order of
their current
weight and the first time I saw it I
thought that looks like a
coincidence that that these skinniest
people don't even walk toward the pizza
they just keep doing what they're doing
like they're not even hungry and then
the people people who are a little
heavier right at the pizza now there's
no way that the way they're thinking
about food is the same because it can't
be a coincidence that the person who's
got a few extra pounds is always the
first one to the pizza but you can see
it really obviously with with
kids so I can tell with certainty that
some brains are different and it's not
about anybody choosing to be overweight
that that's not what
happens um so there is no free will
uh if you're an NPC and you'd like to
argue this let me tell you how the way
you could argue in favor of Free Will
existing is you just replace
words with your own personal definition
so if you want to argue here's what
you'd say um to to maintain your
illusion of Free Will you'd say
something like but I choose what I do
that's free
will no that's just putting a different
word for another word that's not
anything or somebody said to me in the
comments we have discipline when it is
hard no again that's just a word you
have discipline you mean you just
replaced Free Will with
discipline no that's not anything that's
just changing a word or somebody else
said um that Scott can believe what he
wishes because he has free
will so I can do what I wish
which means I have free will because you
just changed the definition of free will
to believing what I
wish yeah we we're not going to get into
this well today apparently Trump will be
addressing the world economic Forum by
Zoom or something and
uh the thing about the Trump era the
golden age is that I would literally buy
a ticket for that if you told me uh
Scott you have to pay $10 to watch a
10-minute video of trump addressing the
world economic Forum uh we don't even
know what he's going to say no idea what
he's going to say would you pay $10 to
watch 10 minutes of trump talking to the
world economic
Forum yes yes I would would you pay $10
to watch one of the movies um that
recently was nominated for an Academy
Award no
what uh I'll pay for the part before
somebody's tied to a chair oh you know
what would be
fun if there's somebody who by some
weird by some weird chance if some of if
if you've watched all of the movies that
are nominated for Academy Award can you
tell me what percentage of them have
somebody tied to a
chair it could be it could be the answer
is none I bet it's not but if the answer
is none maybe that's how you win an eomm
award it's like okay I'm writing it and
and then he's tied to a chair wait a
minute what if he's not tied to a chair
and next next you know you're nominated
for the Academy Award hey what he wasn't
even tied to a chair Academy
a anyway CNN is devolving into a
podcast so uh reportedly their CEO mark
thas
he uh he plans to do Mass layoffs as you
know um but apparently reportedly I
wasn't at the meeting so again I'll use
the same
standard if this story were about Trump
I would warn you it's probably not true
because there's no Source right it's
just somebody was at a meeting were they
were they at that meeting we don't know
so recreationally
just for fun I'm going to treat it like
it's true and the story is that uh there
was a meeting in which the CEO CNN told
Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper that
they ought to avoid prejudging Trump and
uh stop talking about the past and all
the laware stuff and you know calling
him a felon and all that stuff and just
talk about what the future looks like
and what he's doing at the
moment um what do you think about
that well it does look like there is
some change it does look like the hosts
of CNN
are intentionally and uh I give them
credit for this most of them seem to be
finding some kind of Middle Ground
however they're still doing the thing
where they invite idiots on the show if
they're inviting idiots on the show and
they give them lots of
time it's the same CNN so you know at
the same time I'm reading this about
they're not going to be you know full of
TVs uh I see a clip of Scott Jennings
have to shut down a salute truther so
they have one of these guests on who
starts with saying that well you know
Elon did that igu was raising his hand
you see I oh my God I almost that was
close I don't know if you noticed but
inadvertently uh I had allowed one of my
hands to be higher than my waist and you
can't do that when Trump's in office
yeah you know as soon as it gets up up
here they're like is that a Hiller no oh
I was just reaching for something I was
over
Hill no oh I was just reaching for
something I just wanted to turn on my
lap the lap is a little no
no so you get get a little
jumpy but they had some guests I hadn't
seen before I don't know her name who
talked about uh musk was overshadowing
Trump and he was doing that that arm
salute now what do you think the CEO of
CNN was thinking when the guest came on
and started talking about the fake news
of the arm salute and the fake news that
musk is going to overshadow Trump and
trying to drive a wedge that feels like
exactly what the CEO said stop
doing so if the host stopped doing it
but then they introduce somebody who
does it and they do that every day which
is exactly what's
happening nothing really helped seems
like it's all the
same so anyway Scott Jennings calls it
the salute
truthers which is pretty
good um Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
came to Elan musk defense about that
fake salute thing and he said musu is
being falsely smeared and Elon is a
great friend of Israel and um all true
all true and I'm trying to figure out
how can I get Netanyahu to do this for
me can Netanyahu do this for me it would
be great I'd like him to say that the uh
ADL uh is not right when they smeared
me that'd be great so uh BB um and
that's the reason that I don't support
Israel because they don't support me but
they do support Elon so I can see why he
would support
them um otherwise I just observe I'll
just be an observer but I can't be a
supporter because they don't support me
got to have rest got to have
reciprocity without reciprocity nothing
works right so a little reciprocity and
then we're in good
shape um there's the Sam mman story is
just getting more and more interesting
so I was unaware until Mike cernovich
found alman's old posts and started
putting them on acts I didn't realize
that Sam was not
just
anti-trump but he was really involved in
being anti-trump in 2016 and 2020
apparently so some of his posts which I
never seen then you know he was less
prominent then so there's no reason I
would have noticed um
so he this is actually a Sam Alman post
on it on back when it was Twitter on um
December 21st or I'm sorry December in
2021 so in
2021 uh so this is after Trump lost the
reelection uh Sam Alman said uh anx very
few people realized just how much Reed
Hoffman did and spent to stop Trump from
getting reelected it seems likely to me
that Trump would still be in office
without his efforts thank you
read and then Paul Graham had said in
2016 so this was just a month or so
before the 2016 election in October he
said few have done more than Sam Alman
to defeat
Trump so according to the people who
know the most and are the Insiders
Sam mman was one of the primary people
for defeating Trump in
2020 and one of the primary ones with
Reed hofen tried to keep him out of
office in
2016 did you know
that that's uh that's kind of
interesting and Alman himself
said on one of these uh I think
responding to Paul Graham he said I've
spent all of my free time and done less
work than I should have on various
projects and a lot of money the various
projects in the context of stopping
Trump how many various projects was he
involved in and how many of them were
totally
legitimate I don't know but
uh but now more recently especially
because he's sort of uh trying to work
with Trump which is necessary for all
the tech leaders are going to have to
work with him
um now he said I don't have his exact
words but Alman Alman basically said
that uh now he's had a chance to see
Trump more objectively and he doesn't
have his old
views and he he explained why he was so
wrong before by calling himself an
NPC so a non-player character somebody
who doesn't think before they act just
goes along with the crowd do you think
that explains it
do you think that one of the smartest
most capable people in the entire
country was an NPC and spent all of his
time and all of his money without
realizing that he' been hypnotized by
the
television now your your first instinct
is there's no way right Common Sense
common sense says you can't be that
smart and have acted that seemingly NPC
like for 8 years or whatever it
was and then suddenly you wake up and
now you see the error of your
ways that doesn't seem real does
it right so all of your common sense
says that doesn't seem like a real
change you you must be pretending now
because it's it's less likely you were
pretending then because you put years of
work years of work and massive amounts
of money before so that looked real and
then suddenly you do you know one post
where you're like oh sorry I was an NPC
didn't mean it and then we're supposed
to believe
it here's the hard
part that's
normal that's completely
normal if if you think there's no way
that could be true because you could be
that smart and that dumb at the same
time yeah you can totally normal if you
were to if you were to look at the
IQs of all the people suffering from TDS
and you compared to the IQs the people
not suffering from it the sufferers are
probably higher because they're more
likely to have gone to college where
they got hynotized
so IQ is actually not
opposite of being fooled high IQ and
high likelihood of being fooled try to
travel together and we have seen genuine
cases where people who had that much TDS
or at least were in the TDS world were
in fact
deprogrammed I know because I
deprogrammed some of them the you know
at least I I was part of the process um
and the fine people hoax did in fact did
in fact no doubt about it reprogram
people who were brilliant and they
didn't know they were acting like NP
sees so the first the first filter I'm
going to put on this is that this is
entirely
possible now I can almost hear Mike
covich yelling at me you
idiot he's just pretending for money I
agree with that I agree with that my my
current best take is that um he might
see he might see that he wasn't entirely
right before but he's seemingly
transactional he's got a fiduciary
responsibility to the company if he
didn't at least pretend to have pretend
to have become Pro Trump if he hadn't at
least
pretended well he wouldn't be doing his
job he he has billions of dollars
personally a stake in keeping open AI
you know a functioning successful
company so now if somebody has billions
of dollars at stake for having the right
opinion they're going to be on that
opinion so there's nothing about his
current opinion that tells us anything
about what he's thinking can't tell what
he's thinking but if you want to say to
yourself I think the old Sam was the
real one I think that's
reasonable but don't rule out that no
matter how brilliant you are and how
committed you are you could realize
later that you were
hypnotized because a lot of people did
you know if we didn't have a whole bunch
of people who said honestly you know and
they don't say this about themselves but
they could they could say but don't I'm
really really smart and I was totally
fooled by
that but lots of people are essentially
saying that so if lots of people who are
as smart as Sam Alman are saying I got
totally fooled and we believe them I
believe u bill aan for example I believe
he was genuinely fooled
but he's also genuinely brilliant how do
you explain that because it's normal
it's completely
normal be being able to be free from
persuasion is a specific skill it's not
a general intelligence thing at all in
fact general intelligence works against
you you're easier to fool dumb people
are harder to fool sometimes because
they'll say Hey you smarty pants looks
like you're trying to pull something on
me well why do you say that I don't know
I just don't trust you but what do you
see that's tipping you off don't need to
see anything I just don't trust you and
you're going to be
right so so the low IQ person who says I
just I just don't trust you ends up
being right and the smart person says H
let's look at all the facts and the
details by reading the New York Times
but I'll cross check it with a CNN to
make sure that one and the they both got
it right oh it looks like they agree I
guess that's true
so now I'll act like Trump is Hitler
because the CNN and you know being smart
isn't helping you it just is a different
skill than understanding persuasion so
you can you see the mechanism you have
to you have to be able to see the
machine if you can't see the mechanisms
of the machine the machine owns you but
once you learn enough about how it's
done such as learning how a rupar is
done learning how incentives work etc
once you realize how the Machine Works
then it just sort of materializes in
front of you and when a new hoax comes
out you go oh that just came out of that
hoax machine and and then you're immune
but you got to see it
all common sense doesn't get you
anywhere on that
topic so um and I didn't know that Reed
Hoffman and Sam were so close and worked
together on this but I don't know what's
going on with read
Hoffman someday we'll find out I think
um New York Times had a opinion piece
today I think it was an opinion piece
hard to tell these days the title was
how labeling cartels terrorists could
hurt the US
economy all right how many of you knew
that the biggest shareholder in the New
York Times is also the richest man in
Mexico and what they're talking about
here is is that the cartels are embedded
in all of the industries of Mexico it's
not just the drug industry but they're
embedded with the you know Agriculture
and everything else so it it could take
down the whole economy of Mexico not
just the drug selling part of the
economy
um now to be fair being the largest
shareholder is only
177% and he doesn't have a controlling
interest that still belongs with the
family so the family is making the all
the decisions but I simply point out
that wouldn't it have been nice to know
that the biggest shareholder for the
people who wrote this article is the
richest guy in Mexico who I'm
guessing has business interests that are
sort of have some cartel embedded with
them
so so you never know you just have to be
aware of the aware of Who's
Who uh um apparently the
Ice uh ice is going to call the uh
nonresidents aliens from now on remember
how that became like a dirty word don't
call them aliens they're just
undocumented I I've never been too
worked up about what name we use for him
and I don't you know I have to
agree that alien sounds more like
something you want to get rid of than
undocumented does and and the names
matter so um I don't love the aliens has
been
reintroduced but I wouldn't mind if all
the words are reintroduced meaning that
it just doesn't matter what you use that
seems healthy uh you shouldn't get mad
if somebody's calls says
aliens you shouldn't be happy if they
call them nondocumented well if we're
talking about the same thing it's just
words well my prediction on the JFK
files which as you know Mike Pompeo had
talked Trump out of revealing all of
them last time according to Mike Pompeo
there's nothing in there interesting
anyway but there are some secrets so
nothing that we would learn that's you
know big and shocking but still a few
Secrets even 60 years old because he
points out that if somebody was in their
20s then they could still be alive in
their 80s but he was just using that as
an example he didn't say that's the
reason some of is secret he thinks 99%
of it already available and that what
little there is left in the JFK file
isn't really going to change anybody's
mind about
anything
um here's what I
think given that we widely assume the
government itself was involved in
killing JFK the question I would ask is
do you think the government that killed
JFK and then you know if it was let's
say CIA related or dullas related um do
you think they would have left the memo
on that do you think there would have
been a memo that you could find in the
files as in uh here's a memo go kill JFK
and make sure you you keep this keep
this memo secret no there's not going to
be something in the file if our own
government killed
them if our own government killed JFK
which which is exactly what it looks
like happened they're not going to
they're not going to keep the memo I
mean even in the wildest imagination
that somebody ever wrote a memo and put
that in writing if they ever put it in
writing which is ridiculously unlikely
they certainly would have lost it by now
if you know what I mean lost it lost in
a fire
misplaced so no there isn't really any
chance there's something in the in the
JFK
file unless the JFK file says that that
the space aliens did
it what are you going to learn there
couldn't possibly be any secrets in
there at least secrets about who did it
there can't possibly
be anyway so I won't hold my breath for
that stuff um as you know TR the Trump
Administration is doing a lot of firing
and the funniest part is the uh Dei
uh professionals are trying to avoid
being fired because all the Dei people
are going to get fired uh by changing
the name of their
job so we're seeing some examples of the
director of Dei quickly changing their
names on the website to Executive you
know just generic
executive uh but I I I watched uh one
young black man who worked for the
government I forget which agency uh he
was he was sort of proudly crowing that
he was moving from his job as a you know
professional in charge of Dei to
something that sounded exactly like Dei
but used different words and he
announced it in
public at about the same time that the
Trump Administration was putting in a
clarifying order that says uh if all you
do is change your name we're going to
fire
you and so they asked people to turn
people in who were just changing the
names and still doing Dei and and like
10 minutes later he updated his post on
X from hey everybody I got this new job
to uh I've been laid off that's right he
bragged about his new job which was just
different letters for his old job at the
same time that the word went out fire
anybody who who changes jobs and keeps
doing Dei but changes the name of the
job so
got
him anyway so there's lots lots of
happening I guess the ice raid are
happening now um we're not seeing
gigantic video and stuff so one of the
things the ice people are apparently
doing
right and obviously they would do this
is they're not announcing where they're
going to attack so they don't have
cameras so we're not we're not seeing a
lot of video of their you know picking
up the people that were on the list of
the bad
people um and that's
good um oh all new hires in the
government got their offers rescinded
interesting all right um apparently
Trump has already sent 1500 uh military
troops down to the Border I don't know
if all 1500 are there yet they started
with 500 but it's targeting
1,500 and they're reinforcing the wall
and building Outpost to help them
monitor any illegal entries uh I thought
I saw in a separate
report
that
um they had orders to shoot basically
orders that they could use deadly
force whenever it made
sense now those are my words but is that
confirmed that that they have the uh
permission to fire at the border you
know if they need to you know we're
talking
defensively yeah well that's very
trumpian and uh probably a good
idea and meanwhile according to just the
news uh Trump is announcing emergency
price relief for cost of living crisis
now that doesn't mean if this were a
Democrat thing it would mean that they
put price gs on things
but that's not what Republicans do
because it's dumb and it doesn't work
haven't done that since uh Nixon that
didn't work out so they learned a
lesson um but here's what he is doing so
you decide if these actions will cause
prices to come down all right um he's
ordering all federal agencies to
untangle the American economy from Biden
constraints now what are those
constraints well he's going to eliminate
climate policies
that generally are going to increase the
cost of everything uh that make food and
fuel costs go up so in the short run if
companies get rid of their climate
expenses I think they would just Bank it
and just keep it as profit I don't think
they would immediately lower the
prices but they might so long-term ISS
should lower prices short term uh the
companies will just take an extra profit
uh he wants to eliminate rent seeking
practices now that's not a phrase that
most people know what it means rent
seeking that's sort of a political
insult that I even I forget what it
means I I always see it and I go can you
use like real regular ordinary words
like there there's something to rent
seeking that has you know its own
meaning so that that's useless
communication so my advice to the people
communicating on the Trump team don't
use Ren
seeking 99% of the public has no idea
what you're talking about they think it
means rent it has nothing to do with the
rent um and he wants to uh let's say uh
get rid of administration administrative
expenses and driving up healthc care
costs
um lower housing costs and increase the
housing Supply create employment
opportunities for American workers well
that rent seeking that phrase rent
seeking is doing a lot of work I think
it means just people getting a job and
some grifty kind of thing that didn't
need to happen in the first
place so rent seeking meaning trying to
get paid as opposed to trying to make
anything better is that a good
definition rent rent seeking would be
just somebody says well if I become the
head of Dei I'll get a big paycheck as
opposed to somebody saying do we need a
head of Dei like why why are we even
doing that I think it's close to
that anyway um so Trump is halting gain
of function research the kind that got
us in trouble gain of function on the
viruses he wants to Halt that but I
wonder about why we why do we call it
gain of
function isn't it weaponization
or are we pretending that we're only
seeking to understand how someone else
could weaponize it so we can treat
it uh oh here's the definition of rent
seeking uh rent seeking when an entity
seeks to gain added wealth without any
reciprocal contribution of productivity
okay
so uh my definition was not exactly
right not really
so I've got something on the screen that
I can't make a go
away which means I can't see you I don't
know if you can see me really come
on there should be somewhere on this
screen a little X or something to tell
me how to turn this
off
really can you even see me I I can't see
your comments I've got a black screen
with one image that I clicked on and no
indication of any kind of a way to turn
it off so I can see
you no it wasn't that wasn't that
clicking anywhere doesn't do it oh my
God I'm going to have to get out of this
to get back in just because I clicked on
an image holy hell can't make it go oh
okay it turns out that dragging it
worked another interface fail
well I'm glad you could see me
anyway so gain of function sounds like
weaponization to me uh Marco Rubio is
off to
Panama uh getting started fast but not
just Panama he's going to El Salvador
Guatemala Costa Rica Dominican
Republican Republic Etc um so he's going
to talk to Panama I'm sure that won't go
well in the first conversation but there
there is a story about how the Panama
Canal got started that I told in the man
cave but I I'll tell now
the the story is and this is wild um
there's a YouTube video on it you could
just go to YouTube and look for Panama
Canal uh and French
engineer so before before the United
States got involved in the Panama Canal
I'll try to tell the story quickly um
the French were trying to build
in the same place but the French uh
found out that every time they dug
something it rained and then the mud
just fell back in the in the trench so
they just gave up so the French left but
there was one
engineer who was a French engineer who
decided to stay to see if he could get
something going so one engineer just
one decides to
um he he decides to convince Panama
which at the time was not its own
country it was an extension of Colombia
so Colombia kind of extended you know
along the little peninsula there uh or
along whatever that is and so he talks
to the Panama panamanians who are more
like an area than a company than a
country he said hey the Colombians that
own you are like ignoring you and you're
not getting your value for being part of
the country you should be in you should
be independent and the panamanians are
like yeah yeah we should be independent
how about that and then he says if you
make me your Ambassador now keep in mind
he's not Panamanian he's a French
Citizen and he convinced the panamanians
if you make me your Ambassador I'll get
you
Independence and they probably didn't
think it was serious anyway so like sure
yeah you're you're our ambassador go get
us some Independence so he goes to
Columbia and says hey
Panama wants Independence how about that
and Columbia said get out of
here because of course that's ridiculous
so he goes back and then he goes to the
United States and this is during a Teddy
Roosevelt's time now Teddy liked to take
over some stuff so he was he was kind of
expanding the Empire so he was already
you know mentally on the same page if if
we can grab something we'll grab
it as he had already done and somehow
the French engineer convinces them that
he's speaking for Panama and that
they're going to go independent and it'
be really helpful if the American Navy
was parked outside you know nearby and
acted like they were in favor of this
Independence now Teddy thinking maybe we
could get some kind of very lowcost
conquer some territory here so the
American Navy sits sits out there
waiting Colombia knows about it and then
the Ambassador the ambassador of Panama
declares
independence and the Colombians are like
hey you can't
oh maybe you can well we don't care
about you that much okay you're
independent so they gain their
independence with no fighting because a
french guy wanted to build a
canal and he wanted America to be the
you know the Builder of it with his help
so so then then he says all right we got
a deal so then the Ambassador who is the
French engineer he comes up with a uh I
guess it would be a treaty or a deal
with the United States that the United
States could have control of the Panama
Canal uh in return for building it you
know they'd have to build it but they'd
have control of it so the Americans say
hey that's great they come they sign
sign the deal and then they pull up to
you know take control of the the canal
and the panamanians say what are you
doing here and the Americans say well
you know because of the deal we signed a
deal so Panama gave us this and the
Panamanian said what deal the the only
person who even knew about it was the
Ambassador the Ambassador who was not
even
Panamanian so so not only did the French
engineer create a new country out of
nothing but then he made a then he made
a deal with the United States the
biggest thing that ever happened in
Panama on his own without telling Panama
so the United States comes realizes they
don't really have any
standing but they have this big
military so they just took the
canal because they knew that Panama
couldn't stand up to the American
Military they knew that they had some
cover story of this ridiculous deal with
the panan
guy so they just it was just Teddy
Roosevelt situation he's like oh I guess
it's ours now and sure enough it was so
and and then the Panamanian
engineer uh had some ideas how to build
it that the French didn't like so his
ideas how to build it were adopted by
the Americans because it looked like a
good idea and it worked and they built
the Panama
Canal now have you ever heard that story
I think it's true I mean I it was an
extensive documentary on YouTube but I
think it's
true so it's a wonderful story again if
you don't think one person can change
the world well there's a big example now
uh the other context is that Teddy
Roosevelt knew that for America to be
the dominant um Maritime power that we
needed to connect our two oceans because
if you can't get assets from one side of
the country to the other without going
around you know uh South America you're
not really the naval power that you need
to be so the panal canal had a lot to do
with projecting American power and
that's why Teddy Roosevelt was okay to
play little fast and loose with
that anyway I'm going to make an
observation I've made before but I'm
give you going to give you some more
details have you noticed that Democrats
have what I call a rape
problem a rate problem let me
explain the the general statement is
that if something is good at a small
scale Democrats will say it must be good
at a big scale and that never makes
sense I mean it might make sense for
making money or something but that's
about it so they say for example if a
low amount of immigration is good for
the
country why wouldn't a high rate of be
good for the
country and then the Republic
Republicans say uh that's badshit crazy
those are completely different
situations a low rate of immigration is
sort of no problem and maybe it's more
plus than minus but a high rate you're
literally giving away your country and
dying those are not just doing more of a
good thing so it's a rate problem the
Democrats for whatever reason refuse to
acknowledge that doing a good thing too
much has any kind of negative here's
another one you don't want your police
to be over policing do you yeah yeah you
don't want the police to harm somebody
you know maybe be a little too tough on
the citizens nobody wants that so it's
good if the police are maybe a little
softer and more gentle in some
situations but if that's good why not
get rid of police entirely
wouldn't that be even better it's a rate
problem you you you don't just take some
little good thing and then take it to
the extreme and say it must be good um
it's nobody really cares if an adult
wants to
transition well if it's good for adults
why wouldn't it be good for toddlers say
the Democrats
again good for an adult to have enough
freedom to make that kind of a choice in
today's world I like it I I could argue
maybe they shouldn't or maybe they won't
be happy but it's not up to me I'm happy
that they have the choice as adult
citizens in a free country yes
absolutely you do what you need to do
I'll do what I need to do it's the best
we can
do but the rate can we keep it with just
the adults we're pretty sure does it
have to extend to children and
dogs um how about
uh it's good to help the
unfortunate most people would agree it's
nice if you get to help somebody needs a
little hand up yeah that's good so why
don't we give all of our money to
everybody else oh wait a minute that's a
rate problem it's only good if you keep
it within bounds if you open your doors
and let everybody come in and take what
they want nothing works it's a rate
problem
about uh if diversity is
good and I would agree that having
having a company who worked Force kind
of looks like the public that seems like
a plus everybody be a little happier
they'd feel a little safer uh they'd
have a little more visibility about what
the customers in general are looking for
because you got people who touch every
Community yeah you can see how that
would be a plus
but if a little bit of diversity is good
why not just get rid of white men
entirely which is what it turned into it
turned into let's just get rid of white
man because if you do it a little bit
it's good wouldn't it be good if he got
rid of all of
them it's a rate problem a little bit's
fine a lot of it is the end of the
country um how about
uh if criticizing a politician such as
Trump one one that you might not agree
with if criticizing him pretty
severely is good because we got a
competitive set we have a competitive
system so both sides will get you know
criticized and we like it because that
that's how we settle things we argue a
little bit so if a little bit of
criticism of trump is
good why not organize a coup against
him again it's a rate problem it's a
rate problem a little bit of criticism
of trump is good I would even argue that
he's such a change agent that I would
even agree with you that a lot of
criticism is good but can we keep it
there does it have to be if if if
criticism is good a coup is good it's a
rate
problem um yeah so here here's another
one uh if a store allows a little bit of
shoplifting
and the alternative is somebody in in
desperate need can't get the food or the
diaper or something we kind of think oh
we don't like we definitely don't like
shoplifting right nobody likes it but a
little bit of
it you could argue the person who stole
it you know got to stay alive got to put
a diaper on a
baby but if it's good if a little bit of
it happens why don't we just open the
door and make it legal to steal
everything it's a rate problem again
it's a rate
problem it it's the thing that they get
wrong every time
anyway so John Bolton as you know lost
his uh Secret Service protection under
Trump but he was awakened at 12:00 a.m.
to be told about
it that that part just seems like they
were messing with him like I I suppose
they needed to tell him as soon as they
knew
so I mean there's justification for it
to give him the most amount of time to
adjust to it but it it just feels like
they're messing with
them um but during the press conference
uh Trump uh said some bad things vam he
said he tried to blow up the Middle East
um and then here's what Trump said I
thought he was a very dumb person but
but I used him well because every time
people saw me coming into a meeting with
Bolton standing behind me they thought
that he'd attack them because he was a
warmonger now how many of you remember
that when Bolton was uh first added to
Trump's team in the first first term do
you remember what I
said because of course I didn't want a
war bonger on his team but if you
remember what I said oh this is perfect
because when Trump walks into a room
with the
warmonger and then he's not as bad as
the warmonger he's going to look like
the good cop so for NE negotiating
purposes is Kind of Perfect to have one
warmonger in the room you just so you're
not that warmonger yourself so that's
exactly what Trump said and I I think
everybody who understands negotiations I
think everybody understood it but now he
says it directly and I do I do believe
that this is not just an excuse If This
Were a normal politician if Trump were
normal I would have said oh you made a
big mistake with him and now you're
trying now you're trying to explain your
big mistake I don't think so I I think
he I think he knew that Bolton was a
negotiating asset and he was going to
use him like that right from the start
uh and only Trump would do that there's
nobody else who have even had that
idea but uh here's my take um I love the
fact that Trump is rebranding Bolton as
the uh the dumbest guy in America
at least on foreign policy because if
you're a ran just think about this if
you're a ran and you were mad at him
because you thought he was going to push
America to bomb your country and now
he's been branded by the actual
commander-in Chief as the dumbest guy of
the
country would your adversary want to
kill the dumbest guy on your
side no no that would be the last thing
you want to kill the Smart Ones I mean
if you're going to kill anybody if
you're going to kill anybody at all you
pick out their smartest guy remember
when Trump uh put the hit on
Solomon it's because Solomon was their
best guy killing their best guy makes
complete sense if you're an adversary
killing their dumbest guy doesn't buy
you a
thing you'd rather they keep their
dumbest guy no matter how dumb it is so
it's kind of funny that Trump B both
removed his security secret service at
the same time he made it completely
unnecessary to kill him It's Kind of
Perfect only Trump all right here's I'm
going to take another Victory lap on
this next
story as one does so apparently Alex
Soros uh gave an interview to the
financial times now the first thing that
should be noted is wait a minute Alex
Soros gave a
interview I've never seen him do that
because if he got interviewed how would
he explain what he's
doing like it's not really possible to
explain what he's doing in any way that
sounds non-evil so I always thought he
just avoided interviews because he
couldn't possibly explain what they were
doing but he does one and then I
immediately looked up who owns who owns
the financial times and turns out the
financial times is owned by a Japanese
holding company Japanese holding
company
so who would be the least
confrontational
media if if you're going to pick of all
the world who would be the least con uh
the least the least dangerous
media I got to think something owned by
a Japanese holding company is not going
to ask you the hard questions
I feel like you're going to get the easy
questions am I wrong I mean maybe I'm
making some kind of a stereotype that's
unfair but are the Japanese news people
uh are they are they world famous for
being extra
aggressive because I know the British
are
aggressive French Press pretty
aggressive American Press very
aggressive and none of them seem to be
able to talk to Soros but the one owned
by
a Japanese holding
company well so I don't think they asked
him any tough questions but still it
made news uh so the first question is is
Alex Soros intentionally avoiding any
serious News interviews I think the
answer is yes obviously remember when
Elon Musk said he wanted to talk to him
and and Soros said yes but I'll bet I'll
bet they can't schedule
it Elon can probably make it any any
time but I bet how bet Alex just he's
busy maybe we could do that later it's
never going to happen I don't think ever
Elon Musk and Alex Soros will sit in the
same room alone I don't think it'll ever
happen because he wouldn't put himself
in that position but anyway here's the
interesting part uh this is being
reported by the Washington Free
Beacon so according to Alex his father
George uh is is angry that the money is
going to well that his own organization
has too many
employees rent Seekers you might
say and so apparently George Soros said
quote I didn't want to create an
employment agency now that's what his
son says the dad said meaning that he
didn't want the nonprofit open Society
to just be hiring people like crazy but
apparently they
did um he said that George was very
upset by the massive number of employees
and quote amount of bureaucracy at his
liberal nonprofit the open Society
foundations
and um
furthermore he says his uh only regret
this is what Alex the the younger one
says he says his only regret since
taking over is that he didn't slash the
nonprofits Workforce
sooner now it gets more
interesting um part of the interview uh
Alex s considers himself a Zionist
meaning uh that he's very pro-israel and
Israel's existence as you know a Jewish
State now at the same time his Society
the open the open Society uh has been
funding millions of dollars to
self-declared anti-zionist
organizations how do you square that
he's massively funding
anti-israel organizations who are and
it's not just an
interpretation these are organizations
who say it
directly but that's the opposite of his
View and this is not a random view
because he's
Jewish right so if you're actually
Jewish and you say in an interview you
know I'm a Zionist or words that effect
but you're funding the exact
opposite the exact
opposite how do you explain it
do you remember who had the only
explanation for this me here's my
explanation I said George senior didn't
know what was
happening that he didn't know what was
happening he didn't know where his money
was
going do I win am I the winner I said
that George senior didn't know where the
money was going what we know is he has
too many people and too much
bureaucracy which does
what it
obscures to the owner what's happening
because even the owner can't penetrate
the
bureaucracy and even the younger Soros
has apparently been funding things that
are very much the opposite of one of his
core
beliefs how do you think he funds things
that are the opposite of his core
beliefs I say neither of them were
active
managers so my high hypothesis was that
neither of them knew what it was doing
that that somehow it it had taken on its
own bureaucratic life and that the
bureaucracy was making the decisions
based on you know Dei and Equity things
and that if you had put uh either of the
soros's in
charge it would have looked
different
so uh he just bought 200 more radio
stations
yeah so I'm going to I'm going to double
down in my hypothesis that the sorosis
are not aware what the organization is
doing uh and I think that's just true
because it never really made
sense anything we saw unless it was
accidental or was somebody else was in
Charge Scott why repeat
lies um well why don't you tell me what
the LIE is could you give me any hint
what what do you think was the
lie I told you what other people said is
that what you're calling repeating the
lies I call it the news and the context
that's
important so you tell me what lie what
lie did I just
repeat right now that was a dumbass
comment if you want to tell me what the
content is that you think I'm wrong
about something tell
me oh that Soros is so dumb not to not
know his business he just proved
it that's literally the story he just
reported on his own that he didn't know
what his business was
doing because the
bureaucracy yeah do better do better in
your
comments anyway
um there's a study u in something called
the conversation Michael pek who says
that learning your polit political
opponents don't actually hate you can
reduce toxic
polarization and anti-democratic
attitudes
um here's my
problem here's what I have no patience
for I have no patience for a personal
accus
in the context of factual
statements I have every every uh you
know every interest in being fact jacked
that part I like so if I say something
wrong then it's wrong but to immediately
assume that there's some kind of
character flaw because you've got some
 idea about reality that I
don't fix yourself just fix yourself
think think about how to not be that
person anymore
anyway back to this so you've heard the
stories of people who met uh Magus
supporters and we're surprised to find
out that they're awesome and you've
heard this
anecdote a whole bunch of times right so
how many times have you heard uh oh I I
had Maga um neighbors but then they kept
uh shoveling my driveway for me for free
and I realized I was wrong about
them you've heard that a million times
have you ever heard it the other
way have you ever have you ever heard
somebody who said you know I thought
these antifa people were all were all
robing but then I met some they were
pretty nice I never hear that it doesn't
work both ways there's there's one side
that was demonized by mental illness TDS
and propaganda and the other side just
wants to be left
alone they just want to be left alone
that it if if you put me in a room with
a normal
Democrat do you think I have any problem
with them do you think that I have a
negative opinion about just an ordinary
Democrat never it's never even occurred
to me it doesn't even seem like a thing
that you should think about now there
are certainly you know the extremists
who are causing the ordinary Democrats
to you know not be exactly the way you'd
want them to be but I don't even hate
the the extremists I just would you know
want to stay away from them because
they'd hate me the only thing that would
keep me out of the room with the leftest
Lefty Progressive of all time is what
they think of me it wouldn't keep me out
of the room because of what I think of
them because what I think is people are
all individuals no two are
alike I'm not going to judge him because
everybody's individual you know if I
said hey you're not like the other
person well what kind of a standard is
that every person's different you can't
be like other
people so no I don't judge
him
um so let's see Thomas Massie says seed
oil lobbyist will be chief of staff at
USDA somebody as the oil seed processor
Association
really so that whole seed oil
thing um I've never I've never followed
it closely so as you know some number of
people say the seed oils are among the
worst things we're putting in our bodies
and other people say no it
isn't um I don't actually know which is
true but I guess we'll find out looks
like it's it's going to come to a head
uh you don't deserve me
right anyway I I just don't know enough
about seed oil I I know there's I've
heard the criticisms but I don't know
how to know what's
true um from wokeness to faith in God
okay all right uh these are the end of
my prepared remarks and I went too long
because it took took a while to get
going
so I think uh this will be a reasonable
time to end I'll talk to the locals
people privately um
later and we got 1,200 people to watch
and we'll upload the show to the other
platforms later it just take a while all
right thanks for joining
everybody bye for now
