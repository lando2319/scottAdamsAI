good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization the best
thing that will ever happen to you in
your whole damn life and if you'd like
to increase your enjoyment level I know
it's hard to imagine you could even do
it at this point we're reaching such
lofty levels well there's one thing you
can try
one last thing you can try to increase
your enjoyment and all you need is a
cover mug or a glass of tanker chalices
dying a canteen drug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope of being the end of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called a simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
let me ask you a question fine people
do you believe you can tell the
difference
between good news and bad news
with your common sense
and your judgment and your instincts and
your heuristics
well sometimes it's not so clear
sometimes we can't tell the difference
between good news and bad news
for example uh California is suffering a
drought for a number of years
what would be good news
if you are suffering a drought
rain
not just rain but a lot of rain a lot of
rain in fact California got so much rain
that it made a dent in the uh
in the drought
so the news today is a
the dangerous side to this
oh yeah there's a dangerous side to not
having a drought it's that the plants
and trees will grow so quickly with all
that water
that when they inevitably dry out in the
summer
it's going to be a forest fire
catastrophe
right so the good news is the drought's
over the bad news is we'll go up in
flames and you won't be able to go
outdoors in the summer
so is there anything that Tinder can't
ruin
I'll just let that one sit there for a
while is there anything that Tinder
can't ruin
you could just fill in the rest yourself
at home
well I saw a review
um I think it was on CNN that said
there's a new show on that's apparently
a banger it's a banger
I think that's like a British word for
good
and I said to myself wow are you kidding
me there's something worth watching on
television but before I before I read
the review
before I read the review I I realized
what was going on
what does it mean in 2023
when there's a movie or a TV series
that's excellent
what's that mean it's really really good
yeah it was basically Brokeback Mountain
yeah so it had to be either Holocaust or
Brokeback Mountain had to be lgbtq had
to be a trans in there somewhere
right so I'm reading the review it's
like and the love story between these
two men oh okay I get it best best thing
that's ever been on television because
it's a love story between two men
and that's all you need to know best
thing on television ever since the
beginning of time probably win a lot of
awards
um
CNN's ratings have reached a new
nine-year low
and this is why we call Greg goffeld the
Thanos
of news
he's destroyed half of his competition
already
but that's only part of the story
um
apparently CNN notched its uh sorry uh
Megyn Kelly tweet I saw who were talking
about it and she said it got it so the
lowest ratings in nine years but it's
also the lowest rating across every
category of the day
so every hour of the day a new low
now here's the funny thing on on Twitter
you can read the comments of the X CNN
viewers and how unhappy they are do you
know why they're so unhappy
why are the CNN viewers so unhappy with
CNN
it started telling real news
not completely you know they still have
a good pocket of bias over there that
that comes out pretty obviously
but they made a concerted and I think
legitimate
move toward actual news where they
didn't just lie about conservatives
and then the people were like what
what yeah so it turns out you can't make
money
telling people the truth or or
attempting to tell them the truth you
could argue whether they get it right
but attempting to tell people a calm
objective truth
is terrible for your ratings
do you know how I know that
does anybody know how I know
that attempting to tell the truth even
if you don't do it right but attempting
to tell the truth you know that's
terrible for Ratings right
it's certainly bad for mind
now luckily I have you know a death wish
yeah that's not literal I don't have a I
don't have a literal Death Wish and by
the way I'm not planning to commit
suicide
so let me put that out there
I am not planning to commit suicide
feeling good feeling great actually
that now that I'm off my blood pressure
meds they were definitely screwed with
my mind but I want you to know I'm not
planning to kill myself
because I do think there's a reasonably
good chance I'll get murdered in the
next two years
I mean reasonable chance meaning five
percent
maybe five percent but that's you know
more than you want to worry about you
probably don't have a five percent
chance of getting murdered but I have a
five percent chance of getting murdered
for political reasons
because I I move the needle
so
anyway
um what was I talking about
I completely lost the thread
I don't know was it interesting was it
anything good
oh about the news yeah so CNN is losing
viewers because they're attempting to
tell them the truth
uh I attempt to tell the truth on my
live streams and tweeting but of course
everybody just says well that's your
truth you big old stupid liar you
gullible idiot we'll talk more about how
dumb I am later
all right uh here's a story that I swear
to God you really can't tell the
difference between parody and reality
if I didn't tell you if I had not told
you in advance that this is real
the following story would you have
believed it
right if you didn't know it was real
would you have believed this if you just
heard it in the wild I'm not even sure I
believe it but I saw it today
that the book 1984
Georgia Orwell's book famous classic the
estate has approved a request to have it
Rewritten from a woman's point of view
finally yeah
finally
finally I'll tell you I tried to read
that thing
you know I tried to read 1984. you know
I was familiar with of course but I
wanted to see if it held up and I tried
to read that thing and I was like oh my
God this book is entirely from a man's
point of view
I couldn't even finish it
there were there were no lgbtq themes
the Holocaust wasn't even mentioned not
once
um
oh maybe it was maybe it was actually I
don't remember
but you know the the biggest problem was
it wasn't from a woman's point of view
and if you could get that fixed then
that that book might have some legs
people might want to start talking about
that
well
um well I swear to God I had something
on my you know why why is it that have
you ever just tried to open an iPad
and just leave it there so you could go
back to it and it'll like just like
change his page and it'll turn off and
it was she'll come up and it'll ask for
software updates and like why can't it
just sit there
just sit there and do what the
sorry will be no cursing
there will be no cursing but I'd like to
call your attention to today's Dilbert
comic which I just tweeted
um and you may recognize this story it's
a dogbert talking to Dilbert see if you
recognize this story from the news
dogbert's reading his phone and dogberg
says the College of psychologists of
Ontario says they will pull my license
unless I surrender to a re-education
camp
dilber says you don't live in Canada and
you don't have a license to practice
and then dilber says they are oddly
aggressive for Canadians
dogbert takes a sip of his coffee and
says sounds like a mental disorder
all right do you recognize that story
yeah the College of psychologists of
Ontario has asked Dr Jordan Peterson to
come in to be re-educated
[Music]
the the best thing that ever happened to
Canadian uh psychologists
industry
is Jordan Peterson
he actually made their entire profession
look worthwhile for a change
he he took this thing that didn't have
the greatest reputation in the world you
know the the practice of psychology and
turned it into something useful for
millions of people around the world
so what do they got to do well you
better re-educate that
because sorry I just couldn't do it I
just couldn't get through it without
swearing
but I think you will agree that one that
one belonged that one belonged there
so I uh
um I had already previewed uh to Dr
Peterson that I was going to run this
comic he asked for the original
do you think I said yes
it's a trick question
it's a it's a trick question
no it's a trick question come on come on
it's me you know it's always a trick
question
yeah there's no original
there's no such thing as Originals
they're all created digitally
but I will setting up a nice copy
because uh
just wanted him to know I'm in his
corner solidly and in his fight against
the Ontario or the College of
psychologists of Ontario
and if you are not aware of this
um
I'm just guessing
just going to take a guess there's a
probably uh better than 50 chance that
the members of the College of
psychologists of Ontario have been sent
a few copies of this topic this morning
probably
I'll bet they got a few copies sent to
them how about when they opened their
email they were oh not 400 copies of
this damn thing being sent to me why do
people keep sending me this comic why
are they mocking us for this totally
reasonable uh
uh effort of ours to re-educate the only
person
who has made them look good in their
entire history
so anyway we'll we'll see if the power
of Dilbert has any any hold by the way
this will become the subject of a
lawsuit
I think
isn't uh Dr Peterson taking him to court
some kind of lawsuit about this I don't
know the details but I will tell you
that the Dilbert comic has been used in
lawsuits before in legal cases and it's
used in the sense of what should be
common knowledge
if it appears in the Dilbert comic
that's evidence that the public should
know about this that it's a commonly
understood thing otherwise it doesn't
become a comic you know I wouldn't do a
comic about something that
you know isn't real uh well I guess I
would but you know the difference
so
it could make a difference it could make
the difference because being in a
delivery comic establishes that it's
ridiculous
you get that right
like it wouldn't work as a joke
it wouldn't work unless it was
ridiculous on its own you can't take
something that makes sense and make a
joke about it by the way did you know
that
did you know you can't make a joke about
something that's just perfectly
reasonable
for example
uh
my company decided to cut expenses
because we were losing money
what can I do with that
nothing right there's no joke you can
make about somebody who does the thing
you're supposed to do
so the fact that it's in the Dilbert
comic and we can all laugh at it and
recognize it as funny and I didn't
change it much just the dog bear had to
be re-educated
the fact that they would re-educate
anybody is so ridiculous
that it just stands on its own as okay
that's just stupid
all right enough about that
um do you think that there's a phone
addiction that we have and that the
reason we check our phone so much is
that the phones are really really good
is that why we check them because
they're so addictive and they're good
that's what we all think right and it
feels that way when I use my phone it
feels addictive
so it's perfectly reasonable to assume
that's what's going on let me throw out
another possibility
have you ever been with somebody you
really enjoyed being with
and then you know she hadn't looked at
your phone in hours
does that ever happened to you
if you're with people or even just one
person and you're really happy with what
you're doing you don't even think about
using your phone
so here so here's the provocative new
Theory
phones are not awesome
they're not addictive
people got worse
people started sucking so badly that
spending time with them is just painful
but my phone never disappoints me
when was the last time you looked at
your phone and it did not give you a hit
you know it's like my best dealer ever
I'm like I need a hit of you know hit us
some chemicals here
scroll scroll scroll good okay
scroll Scrolls
all right I'm happy now
I've said this a lot but I think that
our changing preferences
have made us all terrible to each other
in the early days nobody had much of an
interest outside of what they were doing
you know locally
so you know at the end of the day how's
your how are your crops oh my crops are
good how are your crops I mean we
basically had common references and you
know people enjoyed each other
because that's what they had
and now I think people are so picky
about what they like and don't like you
put any two together and there's so much
they disagree on
because there's so much they think about
and there's so many different ways to
look at everything that we end up being
like two porcupines who can't hug
you know it's like
although I guess porcupines do reproduce
you ever wonder how porcupines reproduce
let me turn it into a joke it's already
a joke I'm stealing this joke
how do yeah all right you've already
heard the joke
how do porcupines reproduce very
carefully very carefully
all right
I'm just putting that out there were you
aware that the biggest cause of
depression and suicide
among the youth is lack of sleep
did you know that
I heard this as a data that if you look
at lack of sleep it tracks directly to
depression and suicide not not too
surprising right so lack of sleep is the
number one cause
of suicide and depression
what causes lack of sleep in 2023 only
the phone and you know screens just
screens
so I'm gonna go all the way here
I think social media should be illegal
for minors
American social media and Tick Tock and
everything else
now Tick Tock should be banned in
America but the other ones you know
they're American companies and I think
they should stay for adults but I think
that minors should not have access to
social media after 9 pm
what do you say after 9 pm no access to
social media but my first choice is to
ban it completely for young people I
don't think young people should have
access to any social media
it's not like we don't know that it's
dangerous
let me ask you this
let's say uh big Pharma came up with an
idea
and the idea was they were going to have
you look at
look at screens every night and you can
do it as long as you want you could stay
up all night if you want
and then they do a study this is big
Pharma right just a hypothetical and
they do the randomized control trial and
they find out that the people who use
their screens at night lose sleep and
end up being depressed and suicidal
the people who do not use the screens
have just normal lives and they're
better
so would the government approve that
product from Big Pharma
if if social media have been tested in a
randomized controlled trial before
anybody had access to it and of course
you can't do it would it be legal
I don't think so
no I think the health impact especially
on children I think the health impact of
social media would have made it banned
if it had been a drug
and the reason that we don't call social
media a drug is because we're stupid
bucket people
humans are stupid bucket people
everything has to be in a bucket what
are you conservative because are you
conservative or a liberal let me get my
bucket oh you're in between no you can't
be in between nobody's in between
get in your bucket
right so as soon as you say that drugs
are are a pill or a injection
then you say okay that's drugs we'll
treat drugs this way we get all these
rules for what a drug is and then
somebody invents social media which is
clearly a drug
all right I won't even listen to an
argument on this point
social media is a drug
that's just administered in a different
way
instead of a needle or a pill that just
goes in through your eyes
as images
but it's absolutely a drug
and the fact that we don't treat it the
way we treat the things that we test and
do randomized control trials has nothing
to do with whether we should or whether
it makes sense has nothing to do with
the logic the reasoning the priority is
nothing to do with that has only to do
with the fact that we reflexively put
things in buckets
and our our medical bucket just doesn't
have screens in it
and that's it we put screens in the
entertainment bucket when it should have
been in the medical bucket
nobody there's not one person arguing
the point
there's not a single person here who
will argue that point yeah it's a
digital narcotic
right
you you tell me
if if we had considered social media
drug
it would not pass
government approval it wouldn't even
come close
not even close
I've heard more people I heard Bill
Marshay the other day that he can't
watch a movie anymore
because they're too long and boring
compared to the quick he had a social
media
I don't know if you talk about other
people or about himself but he made the
point now who was the first person you
heard say that
I think I'm the first person you've ever
heard say that that you that movies are
dead
you'll never be able to watch a movie
again unless you're with somebody it's
more about being with the person
yeah
yeah
so I was ahead of the curve on that I
guess
um
so U.S news
uh the periodical the publication U.S
news every year they do uh ranking of
Colleges and Schools I guess they do
graduate schools and medical schools and
stuff like that yeah they're having a
trouble uh ranking medical schools
because some of some of the medical
schools are resisting
being ranked on their usual standards
and they say that they won't even
contribute information to the rankings
unless
their diversity and Equity successes are
included in their ranking
what do you think of that
would you like would you like colleges
to be ranked in part the quality of the
school the quality of the school not
just the fairness
but the quality of the education that's
what's being ranked not fairness but the
quality of the education and they're
saying that the quality of the education
is better when you've got more diversity
and equity and inclusion
what do you think of that
do you think you get a better education
if there's more diversity
you're all racist
you totally get a better education if
there's more diversity you're off record
racist
and I mean that literally
yeah I'm sorry I just have to say that
to your screen faces
now if the only variable is different if
the only variable that's different is
diversity it's all positive
uh do you disagree
because the diversity does give you more
access to more points of view
so if everybody's equally qualified
that's a benefit
really you don't think that's a benefit
if everybody's the same qualifications
you don't think diversity gives you more
points of view more access more windows
to look through you know more more
understanding better bedside manner
perhaps because you you understand
people better no it's unambiguously good
all right well you could argue that
point but here's my point
it's the way they get there
is sacrificing Merit
then does everybody think that's good
if you were to de-prioritize Merit to
get more equity and more diversity is
that is that still good
well yeah there's a crossover point
right so you're getting something from
diversity and I'm I'll argue that to the
death
um because simply because I've been in
those environments whenever I'm in an
environment where there's more diversity
I'm absolutely picking up more
understanding there's just no way to
argue that you can't argue that
but if you give up Merit
here's what I think we need to do
I think I would like to know if my
doctor got one of those uh Equity
degrees or one of those Merit degrees
don't you think we should make a
difference
would you like to know oh doctor I see
you have a degree did you get one of the
equity types or one of the Merit types
now this will never happen of course
but there are so many things that could
be solved by truth and labeling right if
the only thing I'm asking for is truth
and labeling
why would that be a problem
let the free market decide if they think
that somebody who went to a sort of
equity priority School
got more out of the equity and the
diversity because there is a lot to get
there
then they gave up on maybe a little bit
you know in the rankings of their
academics yeah maybe it's not that big a
deal you know maybe it's a small tweak
to to the uh Merit to get a lot more
diversity
you can make that argument
but I would certainly like as a consumer
to know the difference
I I want to know
was equity and diversity a big deal at
the school you went to
and did that have anything to do with
the fact that you made it through
or was it Merit only
so
so today I have a uh a doctor who is a
woman and
she's brown of some type I've never
asked all right so she's a person of
color some kind of a brown whatever
and she's a woman
I have never once
thought that she was there for any
reason other than Merit
never even occurred to me
never once in my mind did I say ooh I
wonder if she only got through medical
school because of you know her her never
once never thought and she's a great
doctor I like her a lot
but what happens in five years if the
doctor's coming out or coming out of you
know Equity priority College I'd kind of
want to know
I mean I might not make a different
decision I might make the same decision
like I'd like to know a little truth and
labeling would be nice
uh speaking of
Dr Jordan Peterson
he is creating an alternative W World
economic forum
and I guess it would be uh Pro energy
that's cheap so that poor people can
have access to the energy and pro
families and monogamy
now here's my big problem with
Dr Peterson's philosophies of life
he's big on family and monogamy
and
I absolutely agree with him that that is
the best system for a stable world
but only maybe for 25 of people and
that's the problem in the old days maybe
it was better for a higher percentage I
don't think I really don't think more
than 25 percent of the public is going
to make a marriage work for the rest
it's probably a bad idea and I don't
know what to do about that it could be
that his approach is the best which is
if you don't push as hard as possible
and the thing you know works
you're in trouble
yeah I get that boy that makes sense and
I do agree
that if you get the right two people and
you put them in the monogamous marriage
it is the best
I I think that that's just sort of
obviously true you know you can see it
in a lot of ways
but let me ask you this question
I'm gonna put on my skeptic hat for a
moment
do we all agree that single moms
uh produce children who have the most
criminal records would you agree
that that correlation seems to be really
clean
you don't agree
I'm not saying it's causation I'm saying
the correlation
would it be easier if I just say
correlation
because the causation is what I'm going
to question next
all right so here's my question
is it also true of college educated
single moms
in other words if you look at only the
single moms who went to Ivy League
colleges and have high incomes
they have high incomes are their
children also more likely to be
criminals
compared to the compared to the average
you think yes
I I would make a really really large bet
that they have a low criminal record
I would make a really really big bet on
that you really think it's going to be
the same
so to me that looks like brainwashing
but I'll allow that you could be right
since I don't have the data I will allow
that you could be right on the surface
it looks like brainwashing because if
you think that in all situations Simply
Having one parent is worse than all
situations with two
that's not really rational thinking
but if you believe there's a strong
correlation when you look at the whole
thing probably yes I think it's been
studied a lot
but here's the thing
there is a lot more going on with those
single mothers than just the fact that
they're single mothers
whatever it is that made a man not want
to be with them
do I need to finish the sentence
right now when I talk about the ivy
league uh woman who's who chooses to be
a single mother
that's a choice
that's somebody who said oh I can handle
this I think I will choose to be a
single mother
do you think that's the same as somebody
who couldn't get a man to live with her
even if she tried
there's no way those are the same
there's no way
and what about uh the man who left
if that woman had stayed with the man
who who left
they would be happy and the child would
do well because there's got to be
something about the man who leaves and
doesn't take responsibility
that suggests that if he had stayed it
would have been pretty bad
because he doesn't take responsibility
and obviously was not in love with the
woman
so I think our our thinking about single
parenting is completely
mixed up with too many other variables
and if the only thing you're seeing is
the Single part
you're missing the biggest part of the
picture
I think
so I think we're completely misled about
what's going on there I think there's a
certain type of person
who's more likely to be a single mom
and that that person is more likely to
be a single mom is unlikely to have an
Ivy League degree
right there are likely
to have a bunch of other characteristics
in common with other single women
and I think it's those other
characteristics that are probably
driving things
now that said
the best way to raise a kid I'm sure
is a mother and a father
I'm not sure the gender thing is so
important but uh you know a two-parent
situation because two is better than one
yeah having two people take care of you
that are adults and love you well it's
got to be better than one you know if
they're both functional
but I think we need to look at that a
little bit deeper it's too simplistic
you know buried versus unmarried
um
Rasmussen as a poll says 48 of the uh
these are usually likely voters they
pull 48 say Biden's handling of
classified documents is a quote major
scandal
what uh
I'll just give you a little quiz now for
those who are in YouTube if you're new
to be
I've developed the smartest
live stream audience in the world
and I'm going to prove it again
not only do they know based on what's
happening and they're smart about that
they can actually
see into the future and see data that
hasn't even presented to them
um so I'm going to ask this question and
watch how cleverly they get the right
answer they've never seen this
information before they've never seen
this before watch this
what percentage do you think after the
Rasmussen told them what percentage of
American voters likely voters do you
think say that Biden's classified
document situation is no scandal at all
no scandal at all
you did it again
amazing
it's 24.
it's 24 but you know those of you who
guessed 25
that was really good you know you just
keep impressing me keep impressing me I
don't know how you do it
but uh 60 of Voters believe it's likely
the information from the classified
documents was used by Hunter Biden in
his foreign business deals
how in the world
can Joe Biden win the presidency
how in the world 60 percent believe that
he and his son and I'm going to add that
you know they must think they're working
as a team
sixty percent of Voters think that
they're selling classified information
or is likely that they're selling
classified information to foreign
foreign entities
isn't it isn't it over
how does Trump not become president
you know you're you're seeing a lot of
trump criticism a lot of it comes from
me and I think it's deserved actually
but
he still has to run against someone
and I think it's going to be Biden
it looks like it's going to be Biden
how does Trump lose
like how it the the only way this goes
is a rigged election
am I wrong
I don't see anything else that can
happen except a massively rigged
election because there's no way that the
powers that be are going to let Trump
win again
I mean without at least trying really
hard to influence it
no matter what you say about past
elections I'll just let past elections
go by as a separate topic
no matter what's happened in the past
they're going to have to rig it this
time
they have to
and and you know what if the Republicans
lose a rigged election you know what I
say
totally deserve it
and I will welcome our new democrat
president and I will congratulate him on
the whim because if the if the
Republicans can't figure out how to
achieve better or stop the cheating
they're not very capable
they're not very capable and they don't
deserve to win and I see no action from
the Republicans to increase the
transparency of the elections
so that you know if it was you I'd
at this point the Republicans deserve to
lose
they're doing everything in their power
to lose the Republicans you know
basically it doesn't even look like
they're trying honestly
um
so there's a video going around that
there was a presentation at the world
economic forum and everything sounds
scarier when it's at the world economic
forum
and this was extra scary so there is now
technology where you could put on some
kind of a wearable device or a earbud
that would monitor your brain waves and
the thinking is that employers will be
able to know if you're thinking about
work
if you're actually working and thinking
about work or if your mind has wandered
to your personal thoughts
and they'll be able to like play back
your brain waves after the fact and say
all right well about three o'clock
at three o'clock you were mostly just
daydreaming about
sex stuff I guess
um
now add to that that your employer can
check your actual actions online they
can check your keystrokes and they might
even know where you are physically
they might track your location
so your employer will know what you're
thinking and what you're doing every
minute of the day
roughly speaking they'll know
so the thinking is that we'll become
this Mass dystopia
with people just hooked into the Matrix
having to work all the time and all
their happiness and and quality of life
will be destroyed and it's all the world
economic forums problem because they let
somebody give a presentation in which
the person who presented it said
don't assume it'll be all bad
it's pretty hard to hear this and then
imagine it could be good in any way
but
let me give you some context
when I got out of college I was looking
for a job at a big Bank
I went to work at what was Crocker
National Bank at the time
before Wells Fargo bought them
and it was when ATMs were just being
rolled out
so ATMs were sort of a new thing not
every bank had one yet but Crocker was
ahead of the the curve do you know what
the biggest
debate was about ATMs do you know what
the biggest controversy was
this technology will be out of control
it's going to steal my money and then
when I complain nobody will listen to me
because it's me against the computer
right and all the old people said you're
going to lose your Humanity because you
don't get to talk to the teller
you won't be able to complain blah blah
now did any of those things happen
a little bit but not really
not really yeah I mean they happened but
not to the point where it made any
difference to the growth of ATMs right
and by the way the the rule in Banks
at the time was if you complained about
the ATM stealing your money
if they if they didn't see it on video
like if they didn't have enough
information
they gave you your money if they
couldn't prove it one way or the other
they actually just gave you your money
you know because usually it was like 100
bucks right somebody'd say hey the ATM
took my hundred dollars
and if they couldn't tell
they just gave you the hundred dollars
because there was nothing else they
could do otherwise they'd have to they'd
have to just get rid of ATMs now
eventually the ATM you know keeps track
of what it gives but it also has a video
and the video would yeah pretty much
prove this if it installs something from
you
so whenever you see a new technology
that looks like it's going to end all
our quality of life we've been through
this cycle a lot
now I will agree that this looks
different AI doesn't look like anything
else
so anything that was in the past that
looked like a pattern probably will be
violated by AI
but it's good to know
that we've been here before we're always
worrying about the next technology will
be the one that ends us all
and I have now an out of box an out of
pocket prediction about AI
you know you know how AI was going to
take all of our physical Jobs first
because you could build robots
so the robots will take the you know the
dangerous physical jobs
and then later the creative jobs you
know those might stay intact because it
would take a long time for AI to get
there it's going to be the opposite
I think AI will take all the smart jobs
coding
psychology you know your therapist will
be AI
um
art you know all art humor entertainment
is all going to be AI
do you know what people will do
manual labor
I think humans will be moved entirely to
manual labor
do you know why because it'd be cheaper
than robots for a long time
that's all they'll just be cheaper than
robots I think the economics will be
that people will be cheap and robots
will be expensive so you use your
expensive robots to be lawyers and
doctors
and by the way AI has already passed the
bar and AI has passed uh what is the
medical licensing it's already done that
it's already more educated than you are
because it's got two degrees you know
even if you have one
so yeah humans are going to have to do
stuff like crawl under uh
crawl under floors to get to Plumbing
humans are going to be figuring out oh
wait
you know just because the wires don't
touch there's also maybe rats or there's
a human element yeah people just be
doing manual labor
now here's the interesting part
do you know what makes humans happy
doing manual labor it turns out it makes
us very happy
yeah as long as we're not working
ourselves to death right you don't want
to be in a slave Gap you don't want to
be in uh you know the gulag but if
you're just keeping busy
you know you're just moving you're doing
a thing you complete a task you get a
dopamine for completing a task you're
moving you're completing tasks it's
actually really good for us
so we probably will become
the the manual laborers and the AI will
do all the thinking for us
that's my prediction
so uh you know it was really uh puzzling
even at this late stage is we still
don't know why Sweden did so well in the
pandemic
it's still a mystery
now there are a few things we do know
about Sweden I found out and confirmed
this this morning
that I saw a list of the fattest
countries in the thinnest countries
America is one of the fattest countries
in the world top three I think and
Sweden is one of the thinnest
one of the thinnest
so I can't understand the whole
pandemic situation oh and then also
I found out today that Sweden is one of
the youngest countries it's one of the
youngest America is one of the oldest
I didn't realize that
America is old and fat and is one of the
oldest and one of the fattest countries
and Sweden is unusually young and
unusually thin
but you know the thing is I can't figure
out
how they did so well during the pandemic
that's still sort of a mystery oh
another thing I found out about Sweden
is that because of where they're located
on the planet
they routinely supplement with vitamin D
they I think they take like fish oil or
something it's nasty but
they have good vitamin D
they're thin and they're younger than
other countries that did poorly but if I
had to guess why they did well
probably Ivermectin
probably Ivermectin I think
could have been hydroxychloroquine
or it could be because they didn't use
masks as much
could be that
but I know I don't understand how just
because they're thinner and younger and
they have good vitamin D I don't see how
they do well in the pandemic unless it
was Ivermectin or Hydrox coli Queen
what part of the story all right
um there are two new studies
about the vaccinations and about covid
and both of them are total BS
you want to hear this BS
I'll tell you we I think we can agree
that all the data about the pandemics
sketchy doesn't matter where it comes
from it's all sketchy but this is the
craziest thing you've you've heard yet
are you ready for this now of course
these are these are pre-prints and you
know who knows if they could be a repeat
or anything but there are two recent
studies one out in Denmark one end
somewhere else that said that if you're
over 50
um you actually did better
if you got the vaccination than if you
didn't
now
here's how we Analyze That
we'll start with what we know for sure
okay and then you this is how you reason
you start with what you know
and then you reason toward the things
that you're trying to figure out what we
know
is that I got everything wrong about my
decisions about the pandemic
so you start with that as your fact
and then we can reason backwards to
conclude that both of these studies are
BS
because if I know I got the wrong answer
it can't be true that these studies are
true because that would sort of suggest
I made a good decision and since we know
that's not the case we start with what
we know take the L I take the L
L taking the L clotting and coping so we
know that's true so then we can reason
backwards that the studies are BS
so I reject them completely
for the BS that they are
by the way how many of you understand
that I'm accepting that I live in the
simulation
and that your reality can actually be
real
as real as anything because we're a
simulation and mind can be real and
opposite
and there's no conflict
there's no conflict if I live in a world
in which everything's different than
everything for you as long as it doesn't
conflict
right as long as we can both reproduce
those two worlds can live as completely
true as true as anything else no less
true no more true
uh have you yet watched Brett and
Heather well
here's something I learned that other
people can do that I can't
suppose uh and let's let's take as our
starting points again we'll use the same
technique since we know that uh
Heather and brat
were correct about the pandemic
so we'll start with the fact that
they're correct
then how did you know
how did you know they were correct
because I'm going to accept as a fact
that they were correct because they have
skills
now they have skills that I don't have
so I can't do what they do right I could
not look at data and science at the
level that they could look at and I
wouldn't understand it
but apparently they can but my question
is how did you know that they could
and all the people who don't have
podcasts could not
like what was it that said to you
the people who are good at this
but also have a podcast
have one point of view and the people
who are I thought were good at it but
for whatever reason don't have a podcast
are all getting the wrong answers so was
it the fact that they have a podcast
that made you think that they're so good
you could just take their point of view
because I looked at him and I thought to
myself
huh I'm not sure the podcast part
is actually telling me as much as it
should in fact when I analyzed the um
when I analyzed the uh for big Pharma
I thought hey they're making money on
these drugs
are they completely unbiased and I said
no
if they're making money
on a particular point of view you can't
trust the point of view am I right
and then I unwisely thought well hey a
lot of these people who have let's say
different views have podcasts and books
and it appears that they're monetarizing
their point of view
much like the people that are
criticizing
now you most of you could look at that
situation and say okay the podcast part
doesn't count they're just really good
at looking at stuff and you can tell
they're good at looking at
stuff
but how did you do that
because that's the part I can't do
to me I just saw people had different
opinions and I couldn't
I couldn't adjudicate any of them
because I don't have the skills they had
if I had the skills they had I wouldn't
need to look at their opinion
right
if I could judge whether Breton
had their
were correct if I could judge that
it would mean I had their skills
wouldn't it
I would have to have at least equal or
better skills to judge whether they did
it because remember your dog can't judge
how you do it work
because your dog doesn't understand your
work
so he can't judge it
right so I'm like the dog
I'm like a dog watching Brett and
Heather go to work
and the only thing I say is roof
ruff
I'm hungry I need to go out
that's all I can add to the conversation
because I don't have their their skills
but you do
many of you have some kind of
heuristic or rule of thumb that you're
holding from me because nobody will
explain it to me and I feel like you're
doing it intentionally
you know something I don't know
and you're all not telling me
you do how do you know that they they
get the right answer like how could you
judge that I'm just like the dog barking
at at a computer
I'm like barking at the television roof
roof how do they put those pictures on
the television roof roof roof that's all
I have
but I'm completely aware that I'm just
the dog barking at the television
how did you know that they were right
and that so many other people were wrong
now I heard you say it's because of
money but even that doesn't work for me
because they're all making money in
their different ways
how did you do it
no seriously how'd you do it
evolution evolutionary biology that's
not an answer
all right here's the other thing that I
can't do
and I've told you this before when I
watched the documentary about Michael
Jackson and the allegations against him
and and children
it was a hundred percent convincing and
boy was it convincing
um
so you believe Brett and Heather because
they admitted when they were wrong
and that increased their credibility
okay now we're talking let's work with
that
so would you say that people who get
things wrong
and then correct it are more credible
than people who
uh are not telling you they got anything
wrong
is that true and do you think scientists
don't correct themselves when the data
changes or they find out there's
something wrong do the scientists
who actually work in the field of
science
did they get new data and then they just
say that data doesn't agree with my
opinion I'll throw it out
is that how other scientists work or is
it possible
that you saw Brett and Heather changing
their minds only because you were
watching them
and that's how all scientists Act
that the reason they're scientists is
because they're going to respect the
data and the process and that when
something changes they change with it
now I thought that regular scientists
were also doing that behind closed doors
and I just didn't see it
whereas if you have a podcast
you do it in public and then people see
it
and they say well that's credible
because I see them doing the most normal
thing that any scientist does but
they're doing it in public
where every other scientist in the world
who does exactly the same thing change
their mind when the data changes they do
it behind closed doors so you can't
really trust them
so being on the podcast is what gives
them credibility
now that I hadn't thought of
so just doing it in public
makes you trust them because you can see
them change their mind
but the people who are also scientists
who do that every single day because
that's exactly what they signed up to do
change their minds
that they signed up to change their
minds to find out new things and then
adopt those views
do you think they're not doing that
Behind These closed doors
that really they just keep their same
opinions even when the data changes they
just call themselves scientists but
they're really just actors
maybe crisis actors
all right so that's one way so one way
is that they change their mind in public
what are some other ways you know
they're right
um
and and the other people followed the
money
so the fact that
Breton had their
had one sort of business model
do you think that if if Bretton had
their head decided that new information
showed that the vaccination was the best
thing that ever happened to the world
do you think that they would adopt that
view
which would be
um reputationally and financially
devastating to them
so so you you trust them to the point
where they would not follow the money
they would be the only ones
so you believe that you found the only
two human who don't follow the money
you do okay well that is very good vote
for those two
see I don't have that skill
I'm still like the dog barking at the TV
follow the money row row rope it's just
different money following a different
path
to me it's everybody following the money
now
if you thought that
Brett and Heather are especially immune
from following the money what about me
because you've seen me take the view
that makes me the least money and you
know it right you know it
you know it
you watch it every day you see me
pissing off my audience every day
intentionally do you think I do it to
make money
I don't know any business model where
that works I'm basically being CNN right
now I'm being CNN I'm trying to be
balanced and it's just killing me
financially it's horrible
but that's what that's what Integrity
looks like
in case you've never seen it
in case you've never seen it that's what
it looks like
somebody says it's my ego
yeah my ego is the reason that I'm
saying things that make people hate me
because of my ego
how do you even connect all those dots
that's a lot of dots to connect
dignity
all right
well that's enough on that
the the funniest people are the people
who uh tell me that they're gonna stop
listening to me until I stop talking
about
you know the interpretation of data
basically
uh and I think you really think I'm not
going to block you for that
I block everybody who says I liked it
when you did this but you know you did
too much of this pandemic stuff I just
block all of them so they won't have to
deal with it again
which I think I think is a fair
that's a fair deal because the thing is
that
um
if I only do what the complainers tell
me to do this would be the shittiest
experience you ever had
like oh these three people told me I
must do these topics but never do these
other topics that's not the show you
want to see
do a spaces debate
I've got a prediction
nobody's going to want to debate me on
this
nobody's going to want to debate me on
this
yeah
yeah it's never going to happen
by the way what do you think would
happen
if Brett and I Brett Weinstein what
would you think if if we were to compare
notes and if we were to say all right
what do you think is true and what do I
think is true how different would it be
how different is my current opinion
from Brett Weinstein's current opinion
about everything on the pandemic
you think it'd be 90 different
I think it would be the same
it would be the same
you don't think it would be the same
there wouldn't be one thing we disagree
on
but you don't realize the idea
what would happen if I debated Alex
Berenson
what what percentage would we disagree
on
here's what I think
I think it would go like this
I've got this information that says
these vaccinations are dangerous
and I would say well I don't believe any
any pandemic data do you
and then he would say well yeah I
believe this data
and I would say
you live in a world in 2023 where
anybody's data is credible on the
pandemic and in about five minutes he
would agree with me
that you can't really trust any of the
data
right he might start that way I mean
this was speculation and mind reading so
it's not really fair but I'm I'm almost
positive that if I talk to any of the
people that you think are opposite in my
opinion
that I have the same opinion
does that blow your mind
is anybody's mind blown
I don't think we'd have any difference
everything that you imagined about my
different opinion is completely
hallucination and I've always known that
you know I've always known that right
that we didn't disagree
the people who think they disagree with
me are completely based on rumors or bad
information or whatever
I mean yeah I'm in 14 to 16 movies at
the same time
but says I don't believe you
well let's test it all right let's test
it those of you who think that I should
have Brett
correct me tell me one statement you
believe he thinks is true that I think
is not true go tell me one statement
just a clean statement something that
Brett Weinstein believes is true
that I don't believe is true go
yeah there's nothing
there's nothing
ivermected you think we have a different
opinion on Ivermectin
I don't know what that would be
here's what I think his opinion is and
you tell me you tell me if I'm wrong
the Ivermectin story is uh
hard to sort out because the the studies
may not have focused exactly in the
right place
some seem to indicate in a meta-analysis
that is helpful
so far so far agree
so far agree that these studies the show
it doesn't work are sketchy
the studies that show it does work are
based on a meta-analysis and then I
would say this to Brett but you know a
meta-analysis introduces subjectivity
because the person who does it gets to
decide what's in and out of the study
and that can and and also if one big
study is bigger than the others it's
really not a meta-analysis it's one
study is it biases it by so much if I
said that to Brett would he say no I
disagree with you a medicine a
meta-analysis in which one study is so
big that it biases the whole
meta-analysis is still really good
you wouldn't say that
do you know why you wouldn't say that
because he's smart nobody would say that
was smart
and then
and then uh do you think I would
disagree with him when he said that the
studies that say Ivermectin doesn't work
are sketchy do you think I would
disagree no I think all the data is
sketchy with no exceptions
so we would agree that all the
Ivermectin data is
imperfect
then we would move to point two if it's
imperfect
should you have the right to try it
knowing that the risks are low what
would I say
why would I say that
would I disagree
I'd say yes of course
low risk
potential upside
plenty of anecdotal reports
and then then Brett would agree with me
the anecdotal reports are not
confirmation
and that the meta-analysis is not
confirmation
and the rcts that say it doesn't work
are not super reliable
so it just comes down to well I don't
know if it works and I don't know if it
does or doesn't but it should be legal
for me to try it
so where would we disagree where would
we disagree
see I have a theory
that above a certain level of
intelligence everybody agrees it just
looks like we don't
[Laughter]
I don't think there's ever been a
disagreement is it blowing your mind
try something else
that was the best you had so the best
you had was something where we clearly
would agree
try something else something else you
think that Brett believes
oh Brett might say the Adverse Events
justify all right let's talk about that
do you think that Brett believes that
the vaccinations are a bad idea for
younger people
yes or no
would Brett say that vaccinations are a
bad idea for younger people I think
you'd say yes what do you think God's
saying
based on current information what would
I say
I agree
I would agree what did I say during the
pandemic before we had you know a little
bit better information what did I say
did it do you remember me saying yeah
let's vaccinate those kids
did you ever hear me say that
have I ever suggested children should be
vaccinated
nope nope
no so where would we disagree
now here's the second question
people over 50 or let's say over 65
wherever we want to do it
would uh would Brett say
that for people over let's say 65.
would he say that people over 65
did not receive a benefit from the shop
what would he say
I think he would say I don't know I
think he would say the data shows that
they had a higher survivability
but what we don't know
is any long-term consequences
yes or no
do you think he would say that
the data shows the data is you know
sketchy but the data does show the older
people got a benefit on average
but that there might be long-term
consequences that could be catastrophic
would I disagree with that would I
disagree with that
if that I think that's an opinion but I
don't really know
no I would agree with that
I have agreed with that as clearly as
possible
so where would we disagree
is your mind blown yet
does it blow your mind that there's no
disagreement between me and my biggest
critic he's not my biggest critic but
you know just for the purposes of this
conversation
is anybody's mind blown right now at all
somebody says do you believe that data
no matter how many times can I get
permission to swear
permission to swear
all right too many knows all right the
too many numbers I'm not going to do it
I'll do this without swearing
let me answer all of your questions
there's a new study on Scott do you
believe it no
there's a new study out that says the
opposite of study do you believe it
no
there's a new study that says you were
right about everything Scott do you
believe it
what do you think I'd say
now
there's a study that disagrees with
everything you said Scott do you believe
it
what do you think my answer is
no
try to pick up the pattern
it's all no
it's all no top to bottom no exceptions
if it has anything to do with the
pandemic it's all no
no
so you don't ever have to ask me again
if I tell you there's a new study that
says wearing masks made your penis grow
do you have to ask me if I believe it
no no
if there's a new study that says the
vaccinations actually made you smarter
do you have to ask me if I believe it
no
no you can you can skip that step you
can skip that step every time
I'm not going to change my mind on this
I'm just not the information is not
credible
at all
and basically this is the same approach
I've taken on climate change
I think it's hilarious
that the world was convinced we can
measure the temperature of the world
I mean I don't even need to say anything
about that
it's hilarious that anybody ever
believed that and that we're measuring
it every year and we could tell it's
moving a little bit and
that's the most absurd thing anybody
ever believed
now if I don't even believe that and
that's that's basically that's accepted
as you know pretty basic science
that we okay we can't measure everything
but we you know as long as we're
consistent with the ones that we are
measuring you know it's not good enough
not good enough
has Health Care declined and since
Obamacare well health care has declined
I don't know if it's because of
Obamacare
by the way I've heard some of the most
horrific Health Care stories
recently
it's crazy
yeah
I mean I you I can't tell you the
stories I've heard but
there's one I heard recently I wish I
could tell you
but it was a failure of a health care
process at a level which
I didn't even think was possible
I mean it was incredibly failure failure
like
oh my freaking God failure yeah and it
happens to be my health care provider
that did it
so it turns out
that there's something called a a
patient advocate have you ever heard of
that
at least at Kaiser there's a patient
advocate
and apparently you could make things go
from nothing happening to Something
Happening by asking to talk to that
person
because things are so bad
that you can't even work it out with the
people you're working with you just have
to
uh
well that's pretty good
yeah anyway
like an ombudsman I don't know if it's
like an ombudsman I think it might be
more than that
all right that's all I got for now uh
YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow
and maybe I'll be right about something
tomorrow but not today bye for now
best live stream you've ever seen
