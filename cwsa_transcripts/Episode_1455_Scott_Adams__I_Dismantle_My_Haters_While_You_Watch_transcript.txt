well people
today will either be the best
or the worst coffee with scott adams of
all time
because what we're going to do is i'm
going to address
some of my critics yeah
i'm gonna address my critics and i'm
gonna
take some of their comments off of
twitter and address them in real time
that's right listening from death row
carl are you really on death row
is that true i think i have somebody on
death row watching this
well good luck to you
and if you would like to enjoy your last
moments on earth
whether you're on death row or not all
you need is a copper mug or glass a
tanker gels or steiner canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid what
do i like that's right coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous except it happens right
now go
oh yeah oh yeah
so um some of you may have seen a uh
tweet by jack posabic who said something
kind about
uh my let's see work ethic i guess
that caused a lot of people to jump in
and say
well they used to like me until my
bad take on vaccinations
my bad take that seems to be the phrase
people are using i got a bad
take so i said to myself huh
i better find out what my bad take is
because that's kind of generic
there are people who were stopping
from listening to me and in the comments
how many of you would say the same
how many of you in the comments would
say oh
i liked him up until the bad take oh the
bad take
lookings looking all right well so i'm
seeing lots of no's but lots of yeses
right so there are many of you here who
believe i have
a bad take um and i'm gonna read
a few of them from my
twitter feed so here's what i said i you
know i said a lot of people say i have
bad takes
and i invited people to tell me what i
got wrong
so these would be people who are going
to tell me
either what facts i got wrong or what
logic i got wrong okay
now i contend that nearly all of them
will be hallucinating
do you think that's possible is it
possible that
nearly all of my critics will actually
be hallucinating
in a way that you can even plainly see
let's find out
now of course this will this will not be
my normally
normal snappy show um
let's say some people agreeing with me
i'll skip those
because they're so smart um
here's one the blonde king is
disagreeing me by saying
taking the vaccine instead of ivermectin
clearly is a bad take
why you left out the reason
will you notice that most of the people
who disagree with me
leave out the reason let me give you
some more
um i'd rather wait for a vaccine with
less side effects and more efficacy
what okay you could wait but we're in
the pandemic now
i'd rather have a vaccine with more
efficacy and
less side effects but the next one that
comes along you're not going to have
much more information
so i don't know about that um
let's see uh
a lot of people who just went silent
when i asked them to give me
real evidence of where they disagree um
oh here's one gestavo says
about me you literally said i wanted
vaccinations
to be forced into u.s citizens
ll but okay
does anybody think that i said uh
that i think a vaccination should
literally be forced
into citizens no no this is a typical
critic of mine
i've said the opposite of that lots and
lots of times
right so here's somebody who took the
time to come in and criticize me
whose belief is that my belief is the
opposite of what it is
now so here's the first one who's
clearly hallucinating or
uninformed right let's see if anybody
else who disagrees with me has a reason
or are they hallucinating uh
let's see some people changing the topic
that's usually a tell
okay here's cecil williams says the idea
that any long-term
effect studies could be considered hard
science
for a virus that has only been around
for the last 18 months
seems preposterous what's that have to
do with me
this has nothing to do with me right so
i don't know is that a hallucination i
don't know what that is
also you have the same level of
expertise as i do on this issue
regardless of your track record
what's that mean if my track record
is the best in the business which i
actually contend it is
on on medical decisions
i have the best track record in the
pandemic now that's partly because there
are lots of issues i haven't weighed in
at all i get to pick and choose the ones
that i weigh in on
but i have the best track record
medically
of the whole pandemic and i'm an idiot
it's just a true fact well facts are
usually true
all right um
let's see uh
here's somebody just saying some things
well these are not even
criticisms you said everyone is
responsible for managing their own risks
okay i did say that is that a criticism
what's the point somebody that he said
the risks of covid are not fully
knowable
which i say all the time so far we're in
full agreement
the risks of the vaccination are not
fully knowable
of course i agree i'm still looking for
the disagreement
you shared how you made the decision to
get vaxxed and how that framework may
help
oh okay i'm sorry this is somebody who's
actually agreeing with me by being
sarcastic
hard to tell hard to tell
a lot of people just didn't give me any
reasons here all right um
oh please why would someone follow you
for or consider you for vaccine advice
you draw cartoons well
i'll tell you why because i have the
best track record
of analyzing the situation of anybody in
the pandemic
that's why now that doesn't mean you
should follow my any advice i give i
don't even know if i give advice
per se i just break things down and let
you decide but okay
so why should you follow me because i
have the best track record
of the pandemic
isn't that a good reason who would you
want to follow somebody who has the
worst
track record why wouldn't you follow
somebody with the best tracker
all right um somebody says you took the
vaccine and it was barely tested
that's a horrible take that's not a
reason
because you have to compare the risks
and the rewards and the benefits and
look at me individually and
you'd have to know what's in my head
it's not it's not a horrible take
to make a different decision than you
did because i get a different
risk profile what do you know what's
happening in my head
if you don't know what's happening in my
head you don't know what my variables
were
to make the decision so you can't you
can't make that
because part of what's happening in my
head is not just the thinking about it
it's the
which one is is more uh
which one is more scary
all right um
somebody says why not just save us all
the time and actually clearly state your
opinion first
i don't know how much more clear i could
get but but i'll
i'll satisfy this for the vaccination
there are two types of risks
there's the risk of dying right away
from the vaccination or from the
coronavirus
and then there's the long-term risk both
from the coronavirus
and from the vaccination would you agree
with the setup
first of all that a reasonable way to
look at it
is immediate risk versus long-term risk
and then if you've compared those you
kind of covered it all right
now what do we know about immediate risk
the risk of dying
or getting a serious illness within
let's say a week
of the vaccination we're well past the
point where we have to wonder about that
because it's at least 10 to 101
advantage
safety advantage overall for getting the
vaccination
is there anybody who would disagree with
the statement
that now that lots of people have been
vaccinated for over a week
that we know for sure that getting the
vaccination
is absolutely ten times or maybe a
hundred times safer
on the in general not for any one person
but in general
we know the vaccination is about ten to
a hundred times safer
than the virus itself for the first week
or two would anybody say that that's
anybody disagree with that because if if
the
vaccination were killing more than the
virus
that would be so obvious we would know
it now
so we do know what about the short-term
risks but that's not all of the risk
you'd all agree right somebody's
disagreeing with that
donald donald do you really think
do you really think that we have
evidence that more people are dying from
the vaccination
of which the vars database only has 12
000
and those are just suspected so it might
be a few thousand
have died maybe and we don't even know
that from the vaccination
a few thousand that's it that's the
whole reported and maybe died
the number of people who died from the
virus is 275
000. they're not even close
they're not anywhere in the same
neighborhood you know we're talking
orders of magnitude difference
so at this point so let's let's back up
in time a little bit
if you go back to before the first
vaccination was given would it be a
rational thing to say hey
i'm worried about people dying in the
first two weeks of getting the
vaccination so i'll wait
i'll wait two weeks who did that
i did i did that i had heard from
scientists that the biggest risk of any
vaccination
usually happens pretty quickly so i said
to myself i'll wait a couple months i
won't be first
was that reasonable i waited a few
months
all right so the risk of of dying right
away
i believe that's gone now for all
practical purposes you don't have to
worry about the short-term risk
because we know the short-term risk is
way way better
to get vaccinated but what about the
long-term risks
can't ignore that right well here's what
we know as of today i tweeted around an
article from april of this year
so the lancet psychiatry
now do we trust the lancet as a
publication
no no we don't because we don't trust
any publications because half of the
things that get published in
in scientific journals or
now not making up half based on the
study
half of the things that get peer
reviewed are just not true in the long
run you find that out
now the lancet psychiatry i think is
different than the lancet it looks like
it
looks like a some kind of cousin
publication
but they found uh um let's see
they looked at 236 000 patients
they found that 34 of them were
diagnosed with a neurological or mental
health disorder
following their bout with coronavirus
for nearly 13 of those patients it was
their first time receiving such a
diagnosis
now do you believe that
well i don't think that's totally
credible and first of all
if only uh 13 of them were getting that
diagnosis for the first time isn't it
more like 13
had a problem if all of the other people
have had these same medic mental health
diagnoses in the past
well are you surprised that they had it
during a pandemic it should be the least
surprising thing in the world because
everybody was
mentally stressed so i'm not sure i
believe 34
but there's there's clearly some
indication
of something to worry about so i would
say
rather than believing it i'd say that
there are a whole bunch of scientists
who think
oh my god there's something to worry
about
now i told you that there's another
study that says up to 25
of of coved recoverers have long-haul
symptoms
and it involves you know brain
inflammation and organ inflammation and
stuff that sounds pretty bad so
what do we know about the long-haul risk
of covid versus the long-haul risk of
the vaccination
what we know about the vaccination
long-haul risk is nothing
except that the people involved with it
think that the risk is low
don't know that's why you test things
don't know
and it would be why we'd love to have
five or ten years of experience but we
don't have that option
you have the option of you have to make
a decision so the vaccination you don't
know
maybe may be dangerous maybe not but you
have zero
information about it the the long-haul
covent
we're pretty sure or sciences pretty
sure that that's real
the size of it is a little unknown but
you know
less than half more than 10 percent
probably it's pretty big
and we don't know how bad that is so how
do you make a decision there
what let me ask just the first question
how many of you would accept the first
part of my statement
that the short-term risk is now solved
we don't have to wonder about it how
many people think
just the short-term part forget about
the long-term we're still
that's separate but the short-term risk
would you say it's true
beyond a doubt that the vaccination is
short is better in the short term
than the than the covet itself some
people
see people say no
mostly s's but i'm seeing some no's what
would be a possible reason for the no
because it's really well studied at this
point and we have
solid solid data on this stuff
i mean we would know if 275 000 people
died from the vaccination
don't you think how many people would
have to die
within a few weeks of the vaccination
before it would be obvious to everybody
a thousand fifty thousand
if even fifty thousand people had died
from the vaccination
that's making that up there's nothing
like that has happened
but even if fifty thousand people had
died within a week of the vaccination
you still know it would be way safer
than the virus right
do you know that now of course it would
depend on the age and
you know of course you're factoring in
that stuff in your head
but if you didn't know that that even if
50 000 people had died from the
vaccination
it would still be safer to get
vaccinated
it wouldn't be close
now suppose you have to adjust for time
because the vaccinations haven't been
out as long as the covet has
so you'd have to adjust those things but
still and still be safer
all right uh
everybody who uses the sweden example
you should know that people laugh at you
when you do that
because the sweden example proves
exactly nothing because we don't know
why sweden did what they did
they did a lot more lockdowns than and
social distancing than
you know we generally know because a lot
of it was voluntary
they've got a whole different social
distancing
standard basically everything from
sweden is
useless for understanding the rest of
the world
but if you still think it is you're a
little bit behind
um it might might be someday but we
don't know why anything is different
from anything else at this point
for example we don't know why africa is
not doing poorly
we don't know why some people are doing
good we don't know why the spike went up
and went down we don't know any of that
so if you're saying look at sweden
you're just looking at one of the other
things we don't know anything about
it's just one of the things we don't
know why anything did what it did
we don't know anything about sweden
nothing
all right all right here's a criticism
of me do you wonder why many nurses who
work bedside are not getting the vaccine
well that's not a criticism of me is it
right
uh it's because we oh i guess it's a
nurse have seen who this virus is
affecting
and who the vaccine is affecting
so this is an anecdotal report
so here's a nurse a person of science
who believes that anecdotal observations
should override the data that we have on
this
everybody who has things like anecdotal
data
should rule uh that's not a good take
um let's see some what some more critics
have say
um
somebody says you took the vaccine
n-word
this person is calling me that's a bad
take
okay that's not a reason um
a guy learns a phrase cognitive
dissonance and all of a sudden he thinks
he is smart
now he feels he's attained that position
he's always tried to achieve
being above everyone else his arrogance
goes so far
to tell everyone he's also going to see
the future
what a tool um where was the
disagreement with me on fact
or opinion see this this is the sort of
thing you get
if you've ever studied narcissists and
the person writing this
is obviously one this is a case of
projection
and when found wrong getting angry at
the
messenger these are two tells for
narcissism in this
in this tweet um
let's see uh
uh you just keep saying they are safe
and no reason not to take them
this is from todd my critic
saying to me you just keep saying they
are safe and no reason not to take them
i've literally said nothing like that
i've never said
that they are safe i've never said that
have i ever said vaccines are safe
i've never said that i've said we don't
know what the risk is
but you have to compare it to the other
risks i think you have two
unsafe things getting the getting the
virus is unsafe
getting any kind of a medical treatment
is unsafe
so again this is a hallucination of my
opinion
uh or how about this one i think you're
the one suffering from cognitive
dissonance
as the narrative you favor is falling
apart
what give me a fact i got wrong or an
argument that doesn't make sense
anything these are my best critics
um do you think the timing of these
mandates and the olympic okay that's not
really on point
um i don't take this
here's a critic says i don't take
medical advice outside of the medical
field
good thinking but also i am
objective enough to not take an
experimental vaccine
over a virus with 98 survival rate
what is the logical flaw with this
person
who says he's objective enough to not
take an experimental vaccine
over a virus with a 98 survival rate
what's wrong with the analysis
the long term right pretty much
there's a very strong correlation that
the people who disagree with me
are unaware that the long-term risks are
pretty well established at this point
just unaware so this is a case of
somebody who thinks i have a bad take
who has never heard of long-haul risk
okay if you've never heard of long-haul
risk
you shouldn't be disagreeing with
anybody you shouldn't be even in the
conversation
all right and how about the virus with a
98 survivability rate
yeah forgetting the long haul blah blah
blah
all right
and looking for some more critics
remember
all these critics and nobody's come up
with anything
except a lack of understanding that
there's long-haul risks
that's it or or a hallucination
um
all right here's patrick says i have the
suspicion that
suggesting that the vaccines do more
good than harm will prove to be
misguided
i didn't do that did i do that
again it's a hallucination um
or or steven pollay says it's been it's
been a great few years following you
and i really appreciate all i've gained
but it's at this juncture in history
where we must part ways i wish you the
best of luck
really i got you can't even tell me what
i did wrong
something about vaccinations
all right um
uh let's see
my takes are all over the map so i claim
to have no bad
takes because my takes are all over the
map
could you give me an example this is
just a hallucination
pure hallucination
my doctor said no don't take it not
enough information an
experimental is it experimental
is that the word that you think works i
would call the vaccination
something that is extensively tested for
the short run
and something for which the experts
think the long run
it should not be a big risk but we don't
know
what part of that is wrong extensively
tested for the short run
not tested for the long run but the
people who know the most about this
field are not too concerned about the
long run
it looks like that's a small risk
what part of that did i get wrong none
um let's see
uh there's a lot of people said to me dr
robert malone's
um talk about how the vaccinations could
be
uh making things worse now i've talked
about that
i fully explained him on this show
so he has a take that needs that
is worthy of research and i agree with
him
i agree with his take that there is just
enough of a hint that there might be a
big problem like a really big problem
you should do the blood testing and find
out now if we got
new information would i change my
uh oh so using
somebody's using the experimental word
in the some technical use
so it doesn't have any meaning for an
argument it's just a technical
description so you're not arguing it's
experimental that's just
the name they put on it
let's see more importantly
dude get a new game has gotten stale
somebody here cures cancer that's one of
my critics
i stopped listening to your propaganda
on vaccines and skip over it
what exactly was my propaganda
so the people who think that i'm pushing
the vaccines
are having a certain reaction
and the reaction is that
they can't figure out what's wrong with
my opinion they just know that they
don't like it
and it would make them feel dumb for
disagreeing
and so they have to stop watching me i
think that's all that's happening
i think that people who can't reconcile
that my opinion disagrees with theirs
by the way this is the only topic today
so
for those of you who say i hate this
vaccination topic
i'm not really talking about the
vaccinations so much as the logic of it
and i remind you again i don't care if
you take a vaccination
i don't care seriously don't get it if
you don't want it
and i don't care if you spread it to
other people as long as everybody has
the access to the vaccination
we're done there's nothing else to talk
about
now the hospitals are going to get
crushed you know more so than they would
i think they'll be fine
in the long run um
can you please change the topic uh to
the price
i don't know what that means uh let's
see
[Music]
you strongly um you strongly implied the
unvaccinated are dumb
i don't know if i applied that but i'm
sure it's true
can then what do you think of this
statement if you were to do
iq tests of the vaccinated versus the
unvaccinated what would you find
what do you think you would find
seriously what do you think you would
find
do you think uh tell me in the comments
if you were to do an
iq test and by the way that doesn't mean
that the people with ioq's are right
right i'm not making the claim that
people with high iqs are right
we'll find out but what do you think
would happen do you think it's the high
iq people getting vaccinated or the low
iq people
yeah we let's all agree iq is overrated
but i'm asking a specific question
somebody says i've implied that the
smart people are getting vaccinated
have i and is it true
it's true but let me tell you something
that i feel i can say with some
confidence
the high iq people are getting
vaccinated
i'm sorry but i would bet
a hundred percent of all the the wealth
i've acquired in my life
i'd bet all of it that if you did a
study the high iq people would be the
ones getting more vaccinated
i don't think there's any doubt about it
is there does anybody doubt that
now of course there are exceptions blah
blah blah you know maybe elon musk who
knows
and he'll probably well i don't want to
talk about individuals
but statistically it's not even close is
it
yeah now i'm not saying that there are
lots of uh
lots of exceptions
yeah the now keep in mind that if you're
arguing exceptions
you're you're not making an argument and
that's that's the
standard that you should probably take
that if you're
if you're arguing from anecdote i knew
this one guy or
i saw this one person had this
experience that's not an argument
you might as well just not even say it
right my doctor is not vaccinated but i
agree with you
now again let me be very clear
i'm not saying that the high iq people
get the right answer all the time
i'm not saying that the high iq people
have this answer right
we'll find out maybe in the long term
but i'm just making an observation
that the smart people are the ones
getting vaccinated
it's not my fault i'm just observing
and i think that you can say that with
high high certainty
but again doesn't mean they're right
they could be the most hypnotized of the
group easily
all right um about
so somebody said they didn't know that
the vaccination reduced
symptoms what
how could you not know that the
vaccination reduces symptoms
uh isn't earned income the best
surrogate for intelligence
i don't know if it's the best but it
correlates
right um
all right let's see uh i've now given
you three bad takes you did not rep
that did not represent you okay let's
see where they
are tweets and replies here's somebody
who's given me
three bad takes
early on let's see if i can even find
them
i wasn't suggesting you thought they
were all real the verse my point was
you thought that the actual number was
less than the varus number in reality
whatever percent of reports are real
they're only a fraction
of actual well what i've said is that
they're highly inaccurate and that
they're not meant as data
they're meant as warnings which means
that they could be much higher or they
could be much lower
but it wouldn't be so much higher that
it would change my opinion
so here is a um i would say this is a
minor point that doesn't really change
the conclusion
but this is a good correction i would
say yes the
the odds of the vares thing being
bigger than what is reported is a
certain possibility
the odds of it being lower than is
reported also a possibility
um
let's see um
you don't need to all right i'm looking
for his other
you should include in the nuance
all right so you're just talking about
uh varus so my take on vares
is that if the vares number was actually
anywhere
near as big or let's say if the number
of people
who had been injured by the vaccination
was anywhere near as big as the number
had been saved
that you wouldn't even need a various
database it would just be obvious
like every doctor would see it i mean
it'd just be obvious
so yes i so i said that the affairs
database is wildly inaccurate
and heck's big criticism is that i only
thought it might be inaccurate in one
direction which i never said
which i never said
but it wildly inaccurate does of course
include it could be bigger or smaller
but being bigger wouldn't change
anything about the analysis
somebody's saying that the fact that
with 175 plus million adults vaccinated
it's a failure of the fda to not issue a
full approval
already um i don't know how that's how
i don't think that's how it works is it
i think the fda
probably needs to wait a while right if
their standard is they wait a while to
see if any problems come up
don't they just need to wait a while and
what you do in an emergency
is different than what the fda would do
in normal days i just don't know that
that's important
i don't know that they can say that
they've
that it's approved before they wait a
little while
all right um
flu has about okay
um let's see some more complaints about
me
how about uh let's take some uh haters
in the comments here
here's one here's a big bird brain
says scott's having a mental breakdown
is that what a mental breakdown looks
like you idiot
you know there's some some trolls that
are worse than others
uh i think seinfeld had an episode on
this
where seinfeld had this agent who used
to say jerry stop
freaking out and he would never be
freaking out
you know so i'm making up this up from
memory but it was stuff like
you know your your flight might be 10
minutes late and jerry would be all
right 10 minutes late
stop freaking out jerry i'm not freaking
out
no just stop freaking out i get that all
the time
stop freaking out you're having a mental
breakdown
i'm not doing anything different than i
always do
can you imagine what a mental breakdown
would actually look like
i don't even have a problem today i'm
literally sitting here with no problems
and somebody here thinks i'm having a
mental breakdown
your iq correlation
might have ended my marriage
tell your spouse that it doesn't apply
to individuals
and there's no reason to believe that
high iq is correlated with the right
answer
in this case um
why do you trust the china cova data
who the thinks i trust china's
cover data
i mean these are all hallucinations
come up come up with a criticism about
something i've actually said or done
picking and choosing what data to trust
i don't trust any data
why only pick stupid comments because
that's the only kind there are
if there were smart comments i would
tell you for example the person who said
you should have mentioned that the vars
database could could have been
wrong on the high side as well as the
low side
that's a good comment totally good
comment it doesn't change the argument
but it's
worthy of correction
richard do right wing chills push
vaccines
i don't know am i so a lot of people
told me i'm
i'm a shill for the pharmacies or the
vaccination people
why would i do that is there anybody
here who thinks i'm getting paid by
anybody
or even have been approached by anybody
to influence i haven't been
i haven't been um
and by the way that would end my career
if i told you i hadn't been
and somehow you found out i had been
wouldn't you agree
my career should be totally over if i
said in public as clearly as i'm saying
now
nobody has nobody's asked me to
persuade nobody's paid me to persuade
not directly
not indirectly i don't have uh except in
index funds i don't have stock in any
pharmaceuticals
do i i don't think so um
so i mean who would take the risk i mean
it would be a dumb risk for me to
chill for vaccinations
um
every death counted as coveted my guess
on the covid deaths is that it might be
somewhere between
50 and 20 percent wrong
that's my guess over counted because of
the number of people who
may have died coincidentally and had had
the virus at this time
but nothing would change in your
strategy if it's off by 50
i don't think it would
so nobody here wants to take me on on uh
i'm i'm telling you i'm this isn't the
regular show
i'm just waiting for somebody to
have an argument that's based on
something i've actually said
uh regarding risk management what about
the incentives
uh pharma's incentives are for the virus
to escape the vaccine that's right
so they can make another one that's
right
but what about that is that something
that disagrees with me
since you know so much
scott you underestimate the big form of
government corruption
no i don't how do you know what's in my
head
have i ever said that i trust big
government
and big pharma to make good decisions i
don't
i trust data you know because they're
independent people
looking at stuff there's you know we've
clearly seen that the vaccines
uh have worked so far
the spiked protein in the vaccine
traveling to the ovaries
sounds like something we should look
into what part do i disagree with
the problem is that this is about me
being right
and so it's not interesting well um
let me invite you not to watch if this
content
is not to your liking i i am genuinely
curious
because i do this in public i'm
genuinely curious
if there's somebody out there who has a
good argument because all the people who
say
scott i had to stop listening because
you have a bad take
on vaccines shouldn't i know what that
is
if it's affecting you've probably
affected my audience by a third
if a third of my audience leaves for a
specific reason and they don't say the
reason
it's worth finding out
um let's see
you can repeat yourself to your blue in
the face
and then you still won't get it well
there's that
um
all right is is it's cognitive
dissonance god yeah
efficacy what about it your actions say
it all you jabbed yourself right
got it is there a criticism
yeah i got the i got the vaccination
that's not a criticism
you got something better
um experts are trustworthy in this case
now when did i tell you i trusted
experts
nothing like that ever happened um
a scale here's a question
a scale of one to ten where was that
question this is going by
so fast how can there be long-term data
on mrna there isn't that's part of your
decision making
we're sick and tired of listening to you
rationalize your decisions to get the
vaccine
if you fully trusted it you wouldn't
talk about it incessantly
that's a hallucination
i don't trust the vaccination fully
and that what i talk about is the risk
and the psychology of it
i would of course talk about it
incessantly
whether i trusted or not because that's
my main topic
is the psychology of things
uh do guys with trophy wives tend to get
vaccinated
yeah by the way there's no news today if
there were any kind of news today i'd be
talking about it but you're not missing
anything there's
literally no news we're still talking
about whether
whether somebody in the olympics can
quit because they
they have a mental condition that's sort
of a nothing
um i
of one to my how much away the fact that
vex vaccine
critics are censored oh um
the critics who are censored are usually
the ones who are pushing
incorrect information but as some of you
know
dave rubin got at least temporarily
limited on twitter for saying something
that the scientists were saying
basically exactly the same thing science
said but
the way he wrote it looked a little
anti-vaxxy just by its
tone and it got taken off but then
twitter said it was a mistake and put it
back
so can you give me an example of
somebody who's saying something that we
should hear
who's being censored is that dr malone
one
because the problem with him is that
what he's saying is we should look into
something
and it's being interpreted as we have
looked into it and we know it's a
problem
so the problem with malone is that he's
being misinterpreted
brett weinstein weinstein and ivor
beckton well
but we're talking about vaccinations
if trump wasn't president do you think
it would be so
political to get the vaccinations well
that's a good question
you know i think you could make a good
argument that because
trump was there at the beginning it just
became political
but it doesn't make sense how political
it became
because it's the trump supporters who
are the least likely to get the trump
shot you know the very thing that trump
will claim as one of his greatest
accomplishments
and there's a good chance it will be one
of the greatest accomplishments of any
president
to get to get the vaccines out if it all
works
if it doesn't work out it'll look
terrible but
trump he was the vaccine guy
so i don't know i don't know how
republicans became anti-facts
somebody says wrong it's blacks not
trump supporters
no it's both trump supporters are a
little higher
on the list of unvaccinated than the
black
adult public but they're both way up
there
my concern is censoring the critics yeah
the censorship is a problem
yes after trump left office he did go
radio silent on
vaccines a little bit i mean he still
says consider them but
he's not pushing them because of freedom
were you or your mom influenced by
napoleon hill i was
early on
what are your thoughts on mandatory
vaccinations i oppose them
i oppose mandatory vaccinations because
the people who got vaccinated don't have
a pandemic anymore
do you believe in data over common sense
i don't believe in either one i don't
believe in either one
because data is often wrong and common
sense is almost always wrong
so you've got two unreliable standards
there
um conservatives by nature are more
skeptical things yeah i think that
explains most of it
why do you trust china's cover data why
does somebody keep asking me why i trust
china's cover data stop hallucinating
whoever thinks i trust china's data on
anything just stop hallucinating
i'm the number one china you person
on the planet
i don't trust china for anything
stop saying that please
uh all right so have we seen any
even one criticism of my vaccination
hypothesis or opinion
this backed by a fact none not a single
one
you have said china is not having a
research
no i didn't no
they're having flare ups but they don't
have much of a problem
are relative to other countries
when you use what is this i didn't
hallucinate when you use the china speak
incorrect data
what like your comments don't even make
any sense
all right um
we know for certain uh arguing or scott
it's like wrestling with a pig all right
so there's more
like uh insults about me
uh bad data
vaccine is the mark of the beast i don't
think so
can you call in no
you stopped reading there how did i do
that well it's just one of those things
you keep asking why china is doing so
well i am
because they're doing so well
well what can you can you at least
i mean your criticisms are just like
literally insane
hallucinations china has some flare-ups
but overall they're doing great you can
reword that a hundred times to make it
look like i didn't say that
but everybody has the same opinion of
china they did great
we don't know why they have some
flare-ups now
that are a problem all right
um i swear to god i have to stay until i
see at least one person who disagrees
with me with an actual fact
or an argument because here's what i
think happened
so so here's my hypothesis that i'm
chasing down and it goes like this and i
had to see if there were any real
arguments that i'd missed
and evidently not so i think this is
what happened i think there are a number
of people
mostly conservatives who are at least
interacting with me
who have a let's say an irrational
meaning that we don't have any data so
whatever decision you make about the
vaccination you could argue it's
irrational no matter which way you go
because we don't have enough data
but i believe that people disagreed with
my take
on vaccinations but they couldn't find a
reason
and so they turned that the disagreement
against me
so i believe that when you disagree with
somebody and they don't know why
they can't figure out what's wrong with
your opinion but they don't want to
change their opinion
that it pretty much makes them think you
had an opinion you didn't have
so i think that cognitive dissonance is
causing people to hallucinate
literally that i had a whole bunch of
opinions that i've never had
and in fact i've had the opposite of
those opinions in most cases
but it's because you can't change your
opinion based on data or argument
which is everybody really people don't
really change their opinion based on
data and argument
and when you hit that argument
and better argument and you don't want
to change anyway
then you have to assume that the person
saying it is is broken
it's your only defense so i think that's
all that's going on
um
and that's what i wanted to sophistry
usually the people who claim sophistry
are the ones who don't understand what
i'm saying
do you think the vaccine nanobots are
making
me say this maybe so
yeah sophistry is just an attack on the
speaker
it's not any kind of a an argument
all right um how did the bad takes on
youtube
compared to locals uh well the
the commenters on uh youtube tend to be
more jerks the comments on locals are
people who tend to be more respectful
but will disagree so it's a
generally there's a big difference in
just respectful behavior locals is more
respectful because people pay to be
there
makes sense
um
scott i think you tend to underestimate
vax risk
for young people what would make you say
that
what makes you think that i have
underestimated the risk of vaccines for
young people
nothing i've said would suggest that
nothing
nothing that's pure imagination
and and i think your point is that if
somebody has a very low risk of covet
and a non-zero risk from the vaccination
that maybe there are some situations
where the balance of risk and reward is
different
of course i agree with that of course
every person has their own individual
risk and they have to take that into
account of course
um
can anything persuade you to go all in
on promoting therapeutics
which ones see the trouble is that the
therapeutics don't have
uh data supporting them that the medical
community agrees with
now if you think that i can look at an
argument between
brett weinstein and the scientific
community
and do my own research and come to a
decision about which one of them is
right
that would be crazy that would be crazy
do you think i could keep up with
brett weinstein on a uh on an analysis
of
of a study no
not even close do you think i can keep
up with the scientists
who might or might not agree with brett
weinstein
no no i can't keep up with either one of
them
i just know that there are two entities
telling me something and
no way to know what's right that's all i
know so why would i go all
in on that sophistry again all right
goodbye
you're gone from the channel sofas for
your garden
i've got to do that with the dale and my
compression
i can't find my dale beard um
so no nothing could convince me to go
all in unless
science science backed it
um
so i'm i'm i like therapeutics of course
but i also see the vaccine as a
therapeutic
um i don't think you'll see me go all in
on any medical stuff
because that would be unethical
am i getting a divorce no thanks for
asking
uh uh
why do they dismiss natural immunity
nobody does that
you know why do people dismiss natural
immunity nobody does
literally nobody
uh we're we are ignoring the biggest
issue
facts vaccine hesitancy is pushed back
to government overreach
not at all about science um
i think those are separate i think those
are separate
i think you could certainly have a
government overreach opinion that's
completely different from
whether a vaccination works it's just
separate
uh some some people think the uh the
trolls on here could be
chinese trolls maybe but they don't all
look like it
uh science hasn't solved the common cold
you know what's funny about that all
right so one of the comments was science
hasn't solved the common cold
the mrna platform might actually do that
that's one of the things it might do
might cure cancer
might cure the common cold so uh
yeah we haven't cured the common cold
but we might have gotten a lot closer
just by having an emergency use of the
mrna
platform all right i need to ask
particular people
questions but i'm asking for any kind of
sense of something that people are
disagreeing with
what's that
okay
china doesn't ship fentanyl and
well i guess i know where you're from
scott
my only criticism you forgot to count
the deaths as long-term
side effects uh
i don't know how that matters to any of
my arguments
i'm pretty sure we all know that death
has a long-term consequence
so you'd have to say more about that
because i don't understand how that has
anything to do with anything i've said
uh do i think trump might get in real
trouble yeah of course there's always a
risk
uh there won't be any different topic
today
because there's no news today there's
there's nothing to talk about today
frankly
um if you injected yeah people with a
placebo
a lot of people would die that's true
uh let's see i've disagreed with you
before and i gave you thank you
made it your own so we're good
uh oh recommending vaccines for those
with natural immunity
is a crock well have i ever said
otherwise
um chance of the norm mcdonald novel
review i can't remember the last time i
read a novel
honestly so if it's fiction there's no
real chance that's going to happen
all right um
mra is into non-reproducing people
what is the big deal
uh why did it only take six months to
find a vaccine for covid but it's been
40 years and no cure for hiv
you know i think hiv is one of the
things that's on the list for mrna
so i think it has more to do with mrna
technology
reaching its maturity at exactly when we
needed it
so had it reached its maturity during um
the aids you know the biggest part of
the aids pandemic
then i think it probably would have been
first
what's your opinion on banning
unvaccinated people from public spaces
i don't care where anybody goes you know
if you want to be unvaccinated that's
fine
like you know it's it's your risk not
mine
i mean in a sense i suppose i do have
greater risk too because the
unvaccinated could give it to me
even though i'm vaccinated but i'd get
you know i'd get a sniffle for a week
and then i'd be happy that i had natural
immunity on top of my
vaccination so i don't know i don't
think
i don't care what anybody does in a
public space
um
scott why is there no chinese variant of
the virus
good question maybe there is
i'm imagining that there are lots of
variants but they aren't all
um a big problem
how do you feel knowing they lied about
the vaccine
can he give me anything else really
see that's the kind of comments that are
useless how do you know
how do you feel about knowing they lied
about the vaccine
who lied and what was the lie i can't do
anything with that comment
i have no idea what you're talking about
between the three vaccines which you
trust the most
um well that would just be a guess it
seems like we've heard the least
problem stuff from the moderna but that
doesn't mean
that doesn't mean much we have so little
data
um oh they lied saying that if you get
the vaccination
you won't need to wear a mask well i
think the mask thing
is persuasion to make you get the
vaccination
so i don't think that the mask thing is
based on science
i think it's based on persuasion it's a
it's a way to guilt
the unvaccinated into getting vaccinated
that's what it feels like to me
it doesn't feel science-based
meaning that it does have a science
based in other words the things which
they say about it are
true enough but the risk reward doesn't
make sense
yeah i don't think we would have had a
golden age without a pandemic
because it shook everything up in a way
that needed to be
um scott changing his tone quickly about
masks
so roger i'm gonna block you from the
channel because this is the most
annoying comment i get is people telling
me that i've changed my stance when i've
never changed my stance
a little hide user on this channel
so and i guess i guess that's the
the biggest problem i have is people
literally imagining my
uh no it's not fragile you can say
anything you want about me
if it's just like insults i don't care
about that you can call me you know
short bald old anything you want
but the the blocking is
uh and it's just the comments that got
blocked you can still watch
the blocking is when somebody say in
public what my opinion is
and it's not right and then they
criticize it that's
meltdown and get rid of all the
all right meltdown guy you're gone
anybody else
israel data shows no reduced
hospitalization from the vaccinated who
are infected
uh what are your sources well every
source i've seen says exactly the
opposite of that
so show me show me a source that says
what you say oh
actually i'm sorry in israel
most of the hospitalized should be
vaccinated
does anybody not know why that's true
it's because they're all vaccinated
the only people who can go to the
hospital in israel are people vaccinated
because they all got vaccinated i'm
exaggerating not all of them of course
but
so if you have a country where 100 of
the people have vaccinations
the only people who will die from it are
vaccinated people
it'd be a hundred percent right there
just wouldn't be many of them
so israel is in good shape but yeah your
your statistic is misleading
um
but if the percent of vaccinated is not
the percent of infected
what does that mean i don't understand
the question
all right uh troops in australia yeah
australians
australia is getting pretty badass about
this you know the one thing about having
lots of countries doing lots of
different things
is that we're going to figure out what
worked now nobody wants
the military in the streets to guarantee
people are socially distancing
in this country we certainly don't want
it but
we also would like to know what works
what happens if it works
what happens if australia ends up
getting the best result
then things get complicated i think in
this country we'd still rather take the
deaths
than having the military in the street
uh we're pretty well armed here so
i think things would go differently um
ninety percent of those in hospitals
they are vast and they should be
that makes sense because most people are
vast
so you know
in this country 100 of the people who
die have
uh have polio vaccinations
it doesn't mean the polio vaccination
killed them it just means everybody has
one
what's your stance on kids getting
vaccinated
um that of course
um it's a tough one because
we would be vaccinating the children to
save other people
that's really what that's about i would
have to say that seems unethical
but the part we don't know and i don't
know i guess
is if there any long-haul risk to kids
i'm guessing not much
but vaccinating a kid to save a senior
feels purely unethical does anybody
disagree with that
because the senior only has maybe a few
good years of life
a child has you know the whole life
ahead of them
why would you take some put some risk on
the child
to reduce some from the person who's 80.
that doesn't make sense
so uh just vaccinate the seniors yeah i
mean that won't protect all of them but
gets there
somebody's got a tony heller question
using temperatures recorded from 30s
higher than now
lends credibility here's the problem
with tony heller's
criticisms of climate change sometimes
i think he's right meaning that some
specific criticisms of a way
something was measured might be right
but climate change is a vast body of
science right now
and i don't think there are any vast
bodies of science let's take
evolution as a good example where you
wouldn't find somebody who could find
some problems
with the way things were studied that
that would be everywhere
so tony heller can find a dozen
different problems
and doesn't really have much to do with
whether climate change is real or a
problem or anything else
those are unrelated
you could always find a bunch of
problems
did you say you think evolution is false
and will be disproved
yes and already has been so
um my prediction about evolution back in
the 90s i predicted that
evolution would be debunked by science
not by religious people
but they would be done be debunked by
science
in my lifetime and that's already
happened because the
the simulation argument debunks
evolution
and the simulation argument might be
false
but there's about a trillion to one
chance it's true
you know statistically um
evolution has been debunked in favor of
the simulation theory
um
how do we know vaccinated people suffer
less well that seems to be
a universal experience in every country
and every hospital
that people with vaccinations are
getting less symptoms so
the evidence is everything everywhere
everywhere anybody's looked
every time every single time that's the
evidence
evolution could be a feature of the
simulation yes but it would only be
written on demand
so in other words if we're a simulation
history is written when you need it
it's not already there it's just it's
designed as needed if you were a
simulation
because that's how we would reserve
resources in the simulation
um all right
it's hard to see all these comments
going by so quickly and doing my best
could you give a persuasion grade and
starting movement to end
child abuse in two generations
probably not i don't know that that one
is
too uh subject to persuasion
oh on a scale of one to ten how much
does
vax censorship affect your trust in the
data well i don't have any trust in the
data
so probably not much
so i went from very low credibility
given to anybody to more low credibility
given anybody
um all right here the ethical skeptic is
saying that uh
it's clear that something hit the world
in 2018 19 and caused an exceptional
rate of growth in
deaths sometime in that year okay
well i don't trust that data either
uh am i saying that simulation theory
and time travel are the same
no i'm definitely not saying that i'm
saying that the history doesn't exist
if you're if you're a computer program
history doesn't exist unless you
need it so you write it as you need it
is there free will for choosing the
vaccine not in a scientific sense
no um
the death rate didn't change scott sorry
what death rate give me a little bit of
a hint
what you're talking about just just a
little bit of a hint
what topic you're on
um
who is going to be the next president
hard to say but um ron desantis
probably has the inside track if trump
doesn't run
if trump does run all bets are off who
knows
um
all right who will be the governor of
california
i don't know uh
scott watch the war room pandemic and
you'd be as smart as us again a
criticism with no criticism
uh
do you think there exists a great
designer well there might be a game
designer but not
somebody who designed the specifics
all right i think we're we've done what
we need to do i've driven away
pretty much all of my viewers now
so i think i'm gonna have more viewers
on locals here in a minute
uh
zero chance we'll go to paper ballots
yeah i think so
how long does biden last i think biden
does
one full year at least so i don't
believe there's any scenario if they can
keep biden on any kind of life support
you got to give the guy one year because
then he can say he did his job right
yeah if biden gets one solid year
you can say i did my job i kept trump
out of office
handed it off to another democrat
presumably
so i think one year because just
psychologically that feels like he needs
to do that
um yeah the eviction moratorium is going
to get interesting
we've all ignored that until now
uh if free will how does free will fit
into the simulation theory
how doesn't it either way we're
programmed
you're programmed one way or the other
oh my god you don't believe the chai
comes
chinese communists but you believe they
are doing well in terms of covet
i believe that we would know if china
had
uh like a huge wave of death
so yes i don't believe their data i
believe we would know
and you know there would be enough
information coming out of even china
that we would know if it was a big
problem
um
all right all right that's all i got for
now
sorry today was uh not my usual program
but i did want to see if there were
actual real
um real criticisms to my opinions or if
they were all hallucinated
i think we proved they're all
hallucinated right
it doesn't make any difference to
anybody's decision making
but that's all for now and i'll talk to
you tomorrow and tomorrow
it'll be a regular show so i won't do
this
