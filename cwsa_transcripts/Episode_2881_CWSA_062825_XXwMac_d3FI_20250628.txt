worked that means it's time for a show
yep that's what it's time for we're going to make sure all your comments are visible
especially people on locals
good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to attempt taking this
experience up to levels that no one can understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need is a cuper a mug or a glass a tankered chalice or ste a
canteen jug or flask vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the simultaneous sip and it happens now go
so good delicious well after the show
um Owen Gregorian will be hosting a spaces on X that's the audio only
function onx and uh you could find that in my feed as
Scottm says you see find the link or you can go to Owen Gregorian's feed and
you'll find the link there so yesterday according to Elon Musk was the first
ever selfd delivered uh Tesla so there was a Tesla that was produced in a
factory drove itself away from the factory and all the way to the end
user's house and parked in his driveway i guess that's the first time
am I impressed yes I'm really really impressed
that a Tesla delivered itself i'm feeling like I I needed to do that
myself anyway speaking of uh electric cars
according to MIT Technology Review which I know you all read
um there's a battery recycling company that recycles the giant batteries from
electric cars who has realized that the the recycled batteries before they
recycle them they often still have about half of their power ability storage
which is not good enough to still be in a car but um it would make a lot of
sense to string them together and make it a uh a uh what do they call it um a
industrial power center so they're they're using it to help
power uh AI data centers so they just put a bunch of old used up batteries
they still have half their energy storage and they can uh do a little
micro grid yeah well G appliances
is going to move uh some of or all of its I don't know a lot of its production
out of China and moving it to Kentucky and it's a $490 million investment
they're bringing back to the US according to uh Lewis Casiano and Fox
Business and uh they want to have a zero distance strategy so they want to manufacture
closer to where they're going to sell and we'll create 800 new full-time jobs
well every time there's one of these stories it makes Trump look like a more
successful president and I'll I'll say what other people have been saying as well this is the best
summer any president ever had the the number of things that Trump has
already accomplished um before he's even gotten his big beautiful bill which I guess he'll get i
don't know they're trying pretty hard we'll talk about that
but looks like uh quite a summer for Trump so how many of you have seen the quote
fake girlfriend filter apparently there's a filter for apps i
don't know which app but you can uh you can do a little video of yourself
and uh then turn on the filter and a deep fake perfectly
realistic looking girlfriend will walk into the frame put her arms around you
from behind and kiss you on the cheek and not not exactly the same way every
time but wow you have to see it because normally you would say to yourself well
yeah I'm definitely going to know it's AI nope nope based on the ones I saw you
would not know that that was not a real person so now imagine that you're not
doing it just for social media imagine that you've got a uh a bot AI bot um
girlfriend or boyfriend and when you look at a screen
they're there with you in in your real life they're not there but if you look in a screen in the right app it looks
like they're there and talking to you on the screen now how weird would that be
oh that's coming so it's called the fake girlfriend filter you have to see it to
believe it it's actually amazing well why would uh
um I I saw a article on uh by Tim Higgins I think he was writing for the
Wall Street Journal and he says that in a lonely world Elon
Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and even Microsoft are vying for affection in the
new friend e economy the friend being the bots so now you've got the the the
visual image of that friend you know in the fake girlfriend filter and now you can give
it a personality and have an ongoing relationship with the bot
um yeah so what do you think of that
do do you do you think uh do you think that the bot friends are going to be a
big deal i do i think it's going to be a really big deal but one of the things
that Tim Higgins was speculating about is that the uh different AIS
might look like um somebody was watching a different news source
so Grock might look like you watch Fox News but Open AI might look like you watch
MSNBC all day so when you pick your bot friend
you might have to pick the one that's that's got the the best news um
knows the same as you anyway um
uh according to AI news the AI called Anthropic was tested to
see if it could run a business and it failed so it didn't make any money and
had lots of bugs and didn't work out so how long do you think it would be before
AI could legitimately run a startup
uh maybe never right maybe never but how long will it be before it can be your
bot girlfriend or boyfriend probably pretty soon if it's running a
business you can't let it hallucinate because that's a problem
but if your your bot AI boyfriend or
girlfriend hallucinates that's going to feel like real life
because real people hallucinate all the time they've got cognitive justence they have fake memories
so yeah I'm pretty sure that the whole uh boyfriend girlfriend best friend
thing is going to be huge but will AI be running a new startup for
you i don't know maybe here's some fake news
you remember the story that sounded fake to you that Meta was going to offer a
hund00 million signing bonus for AI professionals like if they're really
good and that was like a big news story
and you probably looked at it and said really a $100 million just a signing
bonus it's not even what the salary is is just a upfront signing bonus and you
said to yourself there's no way that's true well guess what it wasn't true
it was fake news um there are some people getting enormous pay packages but
it's not upfront so that that was just never real so there are people who might make a hund00
million you know over a certain amount of time and there's some people who are definitely making over $20 million
already per year um so all it would be would be 25
million per year for four years um which is enormous and incredible and your
brain can barely hold it but it's not $100 million upfront so that was fake
news speaking of fake news um Governor Nuome
of California is suing Fox News for uh claiming that he had not talked to
President Trump um relative to the the protests about
ICE in California now Nuome said he had talked to Trump
but I think Trump himself may have said he didn't but in any event uh at least
Jesse Waters reported on Fox News um what they believed to be true which
is that they that Nuome had lied so Nome is suing
because he says he didn't lie and he's probably can prove it um and he's suing
for $787 million now does that seem like a little bit too
much apparently that's sort of similar to how much um
Fox News paid to one of the uh one of the voting
companies that sued him i forget which one so he may have picked that number just
because it reminds you that Fox News once lost a lawsuit of that that type so
but he would take a correction so if Fox News uh just goes out and says "Whoops we got
that story wrong." He would take that so he's pretty good at getting attention I
got to say was it Dominion or was it the other one i forget
well we got some Supreme Court verdicts yesterday right after I was done with my
podcast so everybody's talked about it but me now i'm the worst person to get
any Supreme Court news about or to to get your news about the Supreme Court
from um I would listen to the lawyers because there's always these weird
nuances you think you understand it if you're a non- lawyer and then you
realize you got everything wrong but here's what I think happened i think
the Supreme Court uh ruled that the lower court district judges can no
longer do nationwide injunctions that would apply to the whole nation when they are meant to be judges for
their own district and there were about 40 different injunctions against Trump
executive orders mostly I guess and uh but it wasn't from everywhere there were
five states that were responsible for I think 35 out of the 40 injunctions
so the problem was that Democrats could just find whoever was the most liberal
judge in a liberal state and they could stop everything in the whole country but
the Supreme Court just ruled no you can't uh you cannot overrule the the
entire country but you can still do your rules for your own district
um now the big conversation is what happens if you had a Democrat president
would you having now greatly empowered the office of the president
uh relative to how much a you know a court could stop him um will the next
Democrat president have the same power yes
and would that be making Republicans very unhappy if it happens the answer is
yes so the presidency got a lot more powerful no matter who's in that job
um Trump says that later later in the year the Supreme Court might take on the
question of birthright citizenship that's the one where you get to be a citizen if you're born in this country
even if your parents are not citizens trump says that that's uh that that was
intended for the children of slaves and therefore he thinks they have a good
argument for the Supreme Court someday overturning it the people who know more about the
Constitution are pretty much unanimous in saying that
it won't get overturned because there's I don't too much precedent and the clear wording of the
Constitution even if their intention was something else I suppose but uh we'll
see if that goes the president's way or not anyway so what could what could happen
is the states could end up with different federal laws
they'd all have the same law but some states could get a liberal judge to do
an injunction that only applied to their their state so you might have for
example a situation i saw some people talking about this on on the news
potentially and I don't know what the odds of this are but potentially you could have a
situation where if your parents are not citizens but they have you in you know
New Jersey you might be a citizen but if they had you in Pennsylvania maybe you
wouldn't be so it could get really confusing
um that's one possibility now one of the stories that and I guess I guess there's
still the option of doing a class action suit against whatever the president is up to but I I feel like that's less
efficient might take longer might be fewer of them
but it's not like there's no recourse there you still have a legal recourse to
try to end a president's executive order through a class action suit I guess
um so that that's my best uh not a lawyer explanation of what happened but
I'm enjoying watching people dump on Justice
Katanji Brown Jackson and apparently she wrote an opinion that uh at least
Jonathan Turley says looks more like a an MSNBC legal analyst hyperventilating
so her uh her written opinion was uh not
well respected by either her colleagues or the experts watching it so there's a
lot of talk about whether she's even qualified for the job i have to admit I
don't mind the fact that the way she's writing through opinion is casual so
she's using some casual language like at one point she put in the in the sentence
she put wait for it and then she revealed you know the big reveal at the end of the sentence um I don't mind that
i don't I don't mind that she doesn't do the full legal ease
but she's also being criticized for her actual opinion being tortured and and
basically stupid so it's not just that she's using casual
language it's more like people are wondering how she ever got the job
so that's not going so well for her uh Jeff Bezos has tied the knot as they
like to say with his now wife Lauren Sanchez they had this big star studded
wedding in uh where was it in Italy in Venice
on some island and it was a starstudded event with some of the top celebrities
and I immediately had the following question why does why does Jeff Bezos know so
many celebrities like how did that even happen and how
well would you have to know a celebrity like Leonardo DiCaprio before he will fly to Italy and attend
your wedding which he did apparently the Kardashians did as well don't you wonder
what what is Jeff Bezos's world like
does he and his now wife do they sit around and say "Hey what do you want to do tonight?" I don't know let's fly down
and have dinner with Leonardo DiCaprio well we've never even met him yeah but
just ask he'll say yes that one of the things I learned as soon as I became a
little bit famous is that if you're a little bit famous other famous people
will take your call and if you're very famous everyone will
take your call so he he might live in a world where you could just call somebody
who is super famous and just say "You want to have dinner?" And they'll say
"Oh totally." So maybe that's how he knows all those all those celebrities
or maybe they all party on his yacht i don't know
the other uh Supreme Court decision is that parents can opt out for their kids
if the school lesson is about LGBTQ content
so I guess that makes a lot of conservatives happy
so if you know that your public school is going to be um uh what would you say uh
training your kids on LGBTQ content
you can opt out for at least that lesson um
Axios is reporting that the so-called MAGA division has ended
do you remember the MAGA division that's when people did not agree about what to
do about Iran and whether or not the US should get involved and then the
president gets involved and uh because the military is awesome got a
spectacular what looks like a win and
now everybody is getting back together do you remember my prediction about the
division in MAGA i I believe I said in public you can
tell me if I'm imagining this didn't I tell you that success would fix
everything and that whatever happened and I just certainly didn't know what was going to
happen i told you that as long as Trump gets a good result
MAGA will come back together no matter what he does he just has to win so
winning fixes almost everything
and I also told you that you know once we got past this the MAGA people they're
not going to turn into Democrats so of course they're going to come back together you know there there may be
some personalities who don't want to go to the same dinner together anymore you
know some of it got pretty ugly the accusations but no people are going to be pretty
solidly proTrump because he's winning and winning fixes everything
well there's some more fake news that I gave you
so I'll correct my own fake news um you know the story about the parliamentarian
so apparently Congress has a parliamentarian who judged the big beautiful bill and
said there's a bunch of stuff on here that you can't do according to the rules of the Senate and the parliamentarian
knows the rules and um I thought that might be forcing
the uh Republicans to change the bill but apparently and I I don't understand
that this works but Politico says um
that uh they've been working with the parliamentarian and changing some of the language so the
parliamentarian would accept it now does that make sense to you this isn't
Politico how does it make sense that the only
thing they're changing is the language because she wasn't objecting to the
language she was objecting to the fact that the
uh the bill was trying to change policy and you're not allowed to make big
policy changes in this kind of a bill unless you get 60 people to vote for it
instead of 50 and they were trying to avoid that because they know they can't get 60
so do they really fix it by rewarding it
but I also learned that they could fire the parliamentarian or just ignore the
parliamentarian now I think they would have to vote to ignore her um but
apparently it's not it's not the end of the bill so I think I I may have misled
you into thinking that the parliamentarian could just sort of stop a bunch of stuff but it looks like
there's just so many weasel ways to get around the parliamentarian that maybe the parliamentarian is in
more trouble than the bill but we'll see so I have a question about how you can
make it acceptable by changing the language
if somebody if somebody knows how that works let me know
um the uh the Treasury has apparently issued some sanctions
against three Mexican uh financial institutions i don't know i
guess they're not banks per se but there are three big Mexican financial
institutions that are being blamed for um participating in the fentinel
trafficking business so they facilitated money transfer allegedly for the chemical precursors
from China that would be used to make fentinel in Mexico
so that feels promising it does seem like if you cut off the uh
the money flow that you're going to get less fentinyl but still
I think it approves that um China is not doing anything to
China is not going to do anything to reduce the fentinel flow so if you thought they were good luck with that uh
apparently the whole fentinel thing seems to be completely missing from the trade talks with China surprise
all right so you know our favorite uh socialist uh probably new mayor of New
York City uh his name is Mam Donnie
and can you believe that in the real world he said in public I don't know if
he said it more than once that uh in order to pay for some of the progressive
socialist stuff he wants if he wins and it looks like he will win he wants uh he
thinks that white neighborhoods should pay higher property taxes
white neighborhoods should pay higher property taxes in New York City
now let me give you some advice if you live in a city where people can
even have that conversation and not be immediately eliminated for
running for office or fired you should get out of there as fast as you can
if you happen to be white because um I'm not even talking about whether
they do it just think about the fact that he can say this openly he can openly suggest
taxing white people more in in the area that he would be in
control of as mayor if you can even have that conversation
and keep your job and you if you're a white person living there you should
really think about leaving because that is uh that is way over the line yeah
there there's no way that's going to make you happy so run
you know one of the uh questions that I have that you're going to hate because I know I've brought up I brought this up
before and just makes all of you get really mad at me which makes me even more determined to sell it and it goes
like this i believe it never works if
you try to overlay a whole bunch whole bunch of you know too much socialism on
top of a capitalist system i don't think I've ever seen it work
have you so if you've got a capitalist system that's cooking along and then you
say "Well we'll add a little bit of socialism." A little bit you could probably handle a
little bit which we do but if you keep piling it on
there's a 100% chance you destroy the whole system and everybody starves to death and you become cannibals right we
we pretty much all agree on that but here's a question that I have what if
you designated some areas to be socialist only and you built them from
the ground up to be socialist um but still with jobs so people would
still be able to you know get a job at a market rate and earn their own money and stuff but that all the things that
socialist leaders want would be there so
if you want free transportation yes if you want free child care yes
um if you want low rent yes but you would have to design it to
be the socialiston optin opt in
stop it if you're an NPC you're gonna say that you would never live there
don't do that because then you're an NPC because I'm not suggesting you live there i'm not suggesting anybody be
forced to live there what I'm suggesting is wouldn't it be good if there was one
city or county somewhere in the country that was fully socialist from the ground
up yeah how can you accomplish some of these free services by designing it
right so suppose uh everybody has a job there
right so if you can work you have a job and
um you still you still have to buy your food so you have to work it's it's not so
socialist that nobody's working you have to work but imagine if they designed
underground ebike um transportation
you could bring the cost of public transportation down to almost nothing if you designed
it from the bottom up to make transportation easy
right what about um child care if you designed the city properly there
would always be some grandmas who wanted to watch your kids yeah but they would be vetted and you know wouldn't be too
far away and all that so you could probably get yourself almost free
transportation almost free child care almost free dog
washing um and you could build the build the uh rental units in the cheapest
possible way that is also very durable and livable so you could bring the rents
way down so my question is this even if you
thought it would fail wouldn't it be good to have one so that you wouldn't have to worry about people trying to
overlay the socialism on your capitalist place you say "Hey look if any of that
 worked it would be working over in socialism town but look out they're all
struggling and and dying." Why not it's only a problem when you try
to combine two systems together that are not meant to be combined together but if
you built it from scratch would people go there would they like it
would they be happy having a low income but also very low expenses
maybe probably the biggest thing you'd have to do is make sure that you didn't
let everybody in you you would have to make it impossible
to move in if you had a criminal record or impossible to move in if you had bad
credit so if you selected people who were good citizens and employable and they just
like the socialist system a little bit better maybe maybe you can make it work
somewhere but just don't lay it onto New York City or anywhere where the other
system is already cooking along um
Trump is mad at Canada again um because Canada wanted to impose a
digital services tax on American tech companies now I don't think that there
are too many companies from other countries that would even be qualified for a
having to pay a digital services tax but I think that's sort of aimed at
um our social media giants and it just look looks like a way for
Canada to pick our pockets so Trump is defend defending the big tech companies
by telling Canada we're going to drop all all of her uh negotiations so there
just won't be any negotiations about trade and he's just going to send them
the bill i I do like this new approach where he
says "If you don't want to have a new trade agreement you don't need one we'll just send you the bill and tell you what
your tariff is." So he's going to try this in Canada first i guess we're going
to send you the bill sorry you uh you are no longer appropriate as a you know
as somebody that we want to negotiate with we're just going to send you the bill
we'll see if that changes anything at all by the way speaking of bills the big
beautiful bill that Trump is trying to get passed before July 4th it looks like
it might be close he I don't I'm not going to I won't predict it will get
done because there's a lot of resistance but it might they're they're pushing
pretty hard to see if they can get it done before the fourth so maybe but at
this point is it fair to say that literally nobody knows what's in the bill
because you've got the House version that's so big that I don't know how many
people even know all the things that are in it then it goes to the Senate and they tweak it like crazy
and then the parliamentarian says you can't do that and then they have to
change the language or I don't know maybe change the policies
and by the time it's done and then there's a negotiation within the Senate
to all right we'll change this if we do this we'll change that if you'll vote for it so do you feel like you know
what's in this thing i am very confused i mean I think it
still has you know the tax elements that we're expecting but I don't know what
else is in there um all right
so Iran well here's a story that I would not give high credibility to yet so I
saw this on a post by Mario Nofl and he's generally
generally I would say um credibility is good because he always shows the sources
and you could you know look for yourself um but the sources for this are entities
foreign entities I've never heard of before so uh I would wait to see if any
other news sources pick this up but the report which I would give low credibility to
but maybe is that Iran's US uh UN ambassador
said that Iran would be willing to transfer its most enriched uranium which
would suggest that they still have it uh to another country in exchange for
yellow cake now if I know my nuclear energy yellow cake would be something
you could use for domestic energy production but you wouldn't be able to
make a bomb out of it so do you really think that happened
do you really think that Iran is seriously offering to transfer all of
their more enriched uranium to another country if they can get in return a
non-weaponized material that they can use for energy i'm going to say that sounds a little
too good to be true but if it is true
um I'm going to say that that would suggest that the supreme leader is no longer in charge
so one of I'm going to predict that one of two things is true either that story
is not true and they're not proposing any kind of a yellow cake anything so
it's either not true or if that is true and they really mean it that would
suggest that the supreme leader is not making the decisions right now there's some maybe a military you know maybe
there's some kind of military control so we'll see
um Harvard is trying to find a workaround for the
fact that Trump is trying to block foreign students from attending Harvard
and Harvard's University John FK uh can yeah John F kennedy School of Government
that's not the whole not the whole Harvard but the uh school of government
is working on a deal with a Canadian um university
called Toronto's Monk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and the idea
is if these foreign students who are already Harvard students want to
complete their education at Harvard but they can't do it because they would be
blocked by presidential order well then they would say you could go to Canada
and you could attend the the University of Toronto's Monk School
of Global Affairs and Public Policy and they would apparently share some
professors with Harvard and then they would tell you that you got a Harvard
degree but you got it at the University of Toronto's Monk School of Global
Affairs and Public public policy now uh let me suggest that there's something
that Harvard might not understand about Harvard well why does anybody go to Harvard
well mainly you go to Harvard so that when you're done you can say you went to
Harvard uh do you think that that will thrill foreigners who want to be able to say
they graduated from Harvard you say "Look you can say you graduated from
Harvard even though really you got half of your degree from the University of
Toronto's Monk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy." So how about that
does that impress you friends are your parents really proud of you oh I don't I
don't know about your child but mine went to the I won't say it again uh then the other
thing is the the casual contact and the networking of being on the Harvard
campus so you would lose the networking of
being in the Harvard c campus you would get a little bit in this monk school
um it's monk as in mu n k not m o n k so
it must be named after somebody named monk anyway so that sounds pretty desperate
it's not a done deal it depends if there's enough demand for it
according to NPR and it's weird that NPR would be reporting this but uh Dominico
Montinaro is writing for NPR that according to Pew Research
if everybody who did not vote in the 2020 2024 election because only about
twothirds of the registered people vote but if all of them had voted Trump would
have won by even more this is on NPR
so NPR is is saying that the more people who voted
the bigger the lead that Trump would have had in the uh general election
so did I mention that things are going Trump's way this summer
what were the odds that NPR would be confirming his popularity
in a feature story i don't know what the odds of that were but you know I certainly didn't predict
it but there it is um
Trump has apparently abandoned plans according to the postmillennial Thomas
Stevenson's reporting that uh Trump was talking about lifting sanctions on Iran
but then the Ayatollah said that Iran won the war and now Trump is saying "If you're going
to say that you won the war when clearly you did not
then I'm not going to lift the sanctions." What
well what are the odds that Iran is going to modify their message and tell
their residents "Okay now really remember when we said we totally slapped
America in the face and and beat them at war?" Well okay that was fake news we
just made that up we totally lost the war and surrendered
and then if they admit that they lost the war and that Trump beat them
then and only then will Trump uh look into lifting the sanctions on Iran's
economy so I don't know if any of that story is
true but maybe there is a truth social post
in which Trump is saying directly exactly that he he he's saying exactly
what I told you that it's because they're claiming victory that he's
discontinuing any conversation about getting rid of sanctions so that part is true it's true that he said it
i don't know how true it was that he was really looking to li lifting the sanctions it could be that when he
brought up lifting the sanctions he got so much push back that he knew it wasn't
possible and then it would be easier to blame it on Iran and say "All right I was totally
going to lift these sanctions." And it had nothing to do with how much blowback I got from Israel and god knows where
else uh has nothing to do with that it has everything to do with your poorly
poorly worded statements about how you won all right so apparently today maybe this
has already happened postmillennial is reporting Hannah Nightingale
that uh the Trump administration had brokered some kind of historic peace
agreement between the um Republic of Congo and Rwanda who apparently were
having a very major war that uh most of us were not paying attention to
whatsoever but Marco Rubio's team apparently
um brokered a peace deal it's a big deal and I guess they're signing it today
and or have signed it now if you're keeping count
that would be two and a half wars that Trump has ended
so let's give him credit for ending the Iran Israel conflict
will give him credit for the Congo Rwanda thing now remember this is all in
one summer and there's a possibility I'm not going
to predict it will happen that would be too far but there's a possibility
that because of uh Trump's you know victory and getting a ceasefire that he
might be able to browbeat Israel because there's some reporting about this but
it's low low credibility reporting so are there's some reporting
that um Trump may have already worked out with Israel ahead of time that
within two weeks of the ceasefire with Iran that they would have to come up
with some kind of a Gaza I'll call it a peace deal
so there's a pretty good chance that'll happen cuz that would be what opens up
the Abraham Accords for other countries you know the other Muslim countries that want to join the
join the Accords which would give them some you know certain economic advantages
so there's a pretty good possibility that Trump will end
three wars this summer
he might you know if if you give him that he ended Iran Israel if you give
him that he did uh Congo and Rwanda and if he gets and I think he might
because Israel has to you know do something different um they're gonna have to they're gonna have to make some
kind of um let's say compensation to the rest of
the area to get the Abraham Accords going again so I think he's got a shot
this summer of ending Gaza that would be three
right and then Putin um is talking about the need to you know
have a summit and he says he wouldn't do a summit with Zilinski unless they'd
sort of agreed on the peace deal so the the summit would come after they'd
decided how to end things so Putin isn't
really acting like he wants to end the war but he's talking like it and
everything does have to end eventually zilinski
is definitely talking like he wants to end the war there's a possibility
and I wouldn't I wouldn't predict it will happen but there's a solid possibility because the war has to end
sometime and it has to end and for some reason
um it might happen this summer that would be four wars
trump has a legitimate chance of ending four wars
in one summer and I'm not even counting giving him any credit for the Pakistan
India flare up that um I think India is saying that the military
brought the ceasefire but I think was it Pakistan who was giving Trump a little bit of credit for
that i don't remember if it was Pakistan or just Trump so Pakistan India may or
may not have been a Trump influence so that one's a little bit of a gray area so he has a chance
I don't know what the odds are but a chance of ending four and a half wars
in one in half a year depending how you score the Pakistan
India conflict have you ever seen anything like this
and then the the stock market is fully recovered interest rates will probably
go down in 2026 you know because you'll get a new uh new
head of the Federal Reserve and
even even economists who said that Trump was crazy and destroying the country
with his tariffs the tariff thing apparently worked
now not perfectly and maybe not as well as anybody wanted but it looks like he's
getting credit for being the only person who knew that the tariff thing could
work yeah with his adviserss how big is that
that is so big it's almost unimaginable then you add on top of it all of his
executive orders then you add on top of it the Supreme Court victories that he's
that he seems to be rolling up left and right
i've never Have you ever seen anything like this i don't remember in my
lifetime I don't remember any president who was anywhere near
this level of effectiveness not anywhere near it so
will will he get a Nobel Peace Prize so my question is this how many wars does
one man need to stop before he gets a Nobel Peace Prize
i feel like three won't be enough
if he ended stopping you know Congo Rwanda Iran and then Gaza
if if he got all three of those I don't think he'd win i think he would have to get at least
the Ukraine Russia thing to look like it was solved and then the Nobel Prize
Committee would just freaking have to give it to him how many would agree that if he ends
three wars in one summer still not enough just because of Trump still not
enough but if he ends four I think they just have to they would
just have to give it to him at that point they'd probably give it to Zilinski or
Putin but uh it would be hard to resist giving it to him if he gets four wars in
one summer anyway
um also Fox News Brooke Singman is
reporting that uh Trump has uh a record shattering $1.4 billion
in his political war chest you know I kept wondering why I I kept getting all
these uh fundraising requests from Trump and I would think to myself he's not
really running again why does he need you know political donations and the answer is he would use
them for the uh midterms so the Democrats are broke
uh their most famous members are literally socialists who Trump calls
communists and Trump has got a gigantic war chest
and some of the biggest victories that you've ever seen in a political context whatsoever
is that enough to win the midterms not necessarily
because the midterms are weird animals and if Trump is not actually on the you
know in the election um anything could happen and the the
history of the party that's out of power picking up seats it's hard to go against that history but
if anybody could if if it were possible
Trump Trump would be the one to do it all right uh there's a University of
Virginia president who is resigning because of the pressure over DEI so they
looked like a white guy to me James Ryan so he's quitting his job as a University
of Virginia president because it's illegal to do DEI and he wants to really
really do some DEI so he's going to he quit his post
according to the New York Post so good he will not be missed
um unbelievable let's talk about Governor Nuome again
so believe it or not and I don't know if I believe this story so there's
something about the story that doesn't add up yet but I'll tell you what it is
um allegedly Gavin Newsome has figured out how to
essentially balance the impossible to balance California budget by he had a he
had a 12 billion dollar deficit now that's a gigantic number for a state
and there was really it looked like there was no way he could close it without you know massively raising taxes
on whoever he could raise it on but allegedly he has closed you know with
his lawmakers closed the $12 million deficit for the proposed upcoming budget
and the way he did it was by denying healthc care to illegal
immigrants the the the way he closed it was by
denying all the progressive stuff that the state wanted to do that every
Republican would have voted against so at least Gavin Newsome has figured
out that you can't just give away everybody's money and expect to still
have a future in politics so I don't even know what to say i mean
basically the only things that work in California the only things that work are
when the Democrats throw up their hands and say "All right we'll just do what a Republican would have done."
everything else just looks ridiculous but as soon as soon as he acts like a
Republican would because you know in his podcast he said that he would be opposed
to uh trans athletes u competing in women's sports and nobody
saw that coming so in order for him to get into the you know the common sense
era he just had to sort of do what a Republican would do which is exactly
this so I don't know if he closed the budget deficit or if this is a done deal but
the fact that the fact that it's even being reported they closed this giant deficit by not
giving away our money that seems like a big deal
well you'll be happy to know that the former Doge employee whose nickname was
Big Balls who left Doge and you said to yourself "Oh no
wouldn't it be better if Big Balls was working for the country?" Well he's back but not on Doge he's going to be working
for the Social Security Administration to modernize their computer network to
which I say "Yes there we go let's uh
let's bring Big Balls back and put him slot him in there at one of the most important and most difficult things you
could ever do and uh let him continue serving the country i like him."
