uh I'm sorry today is just too funny
it's a funny day
it's not my fault all the news is funny
all the comments are funny
I I think we've just reached the point
of total Ridiculousness like Peak
Ridiculousness and it's just funny today
well if you'd like to take this
experience up a notch and I know you
would it's already the highlight of
civilization but it could be better and
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
up tanker Charles or Stein the canteen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now
especially all you women who are in your
Prime
for the simultaneous sip it's a dopamine
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
oh
so
you know I wasn't going to talk about it
again today but the the Don Lemon story
where he said that the women are in
their Prime in their 20s and 30s and and
maybe their 40s
foreign
for a while I thought oh I'm going to
add my wise commentary to this story and
I'm gonna you know I'm gonna flip it
around like I try to do and look at it
in a different way than the news is
looking at it but there's just nothing
you could say about that
there's nothing you can say about the
story
it just it just lives as a perfect
moment of Ridiculousness
that you should not you should not alter
like just let it live just the way it is
it's perfect
it's perfect the way it is like it's
everything it's it's the entire you know
on Twitter
I called it a walker game instead of a
poker game
in a walker game instead of you know
kings and queens you've got various uh
victimized groups
so poor Don Lemon had two women on the
panel there with them
but
two women normally would be a winning
hand
but he was gay and black
so it's not clear what's the winning
hand there but I think we've I think
we've seen that women is the windy hand
now as I've said for a long time CNN is
a largely a female
perspective news entity
I don't know if it's intentional but it
ended up being that way
a waking bear says hey Scott in caps I'm
eating a steak and cheese sub for
breakfast how does that make you feel
good
I feel good was that a trick question
[Laughter]
the
people often think that the choices I
make for myself
are somehow a choice I think they should
make
do you think I care what you put in your
body
you you could you could vaccinate your
tongue 17 times and eat a big pile of
rubbish
and I would say good for you
I feel the same no matter which one no
matter what you eat or or vaccinate
yourself with
all right I'd like to start with a quiz
to show you how smart my audience is
don't give me the answer no stop it
don't give me the answer before I ask
the question that's too smart
okay you got the right answer
now there are a lot of audiences for
live streams which wait for the question
before the answer
but this is not the kind of uh audience
that needs that little extra help no
this is not remedial audience
this is smart audience yes you have the
right answer correct your many of you
are within one percent of the right
answer
I guess I should tell you the question
if there's anybody who's slow and needs
to catch up I'll tell you the question
uh Michael Schellenberg was tweeting
this this morning there's a Gallup poll
and asked how many people have a
favorable view of the news media
yeah you were right 26 percent
now
the first 25 times I told you that you
could predict
that about 25 percent of the public will
get every question wrong
did you say to yourself well that can't
be true
and then over and over and over it's
true now it's not true 100 of the time
but it's true so often it's hilarious
well McCarthy went to the Border talking
about border security and Fentanyl and
failing completely
complete failure so let me let me say as
clearly as I can the Republicans are a
complete failure on Fentanyl and the
border and they always make the same
mistake
it's always the same mistake it's one
really really easy
thing to know that they act like they
don't know but Daniel Dale of CNN
corrects them
and so McCarthy was saying the border
border security is bad because there's
so much fentanyl being seized at the
border does that make sense to you
we know the border security is bad
because we're seizing twice as much
fentanyl as ever
that's like the opposite isn't it that's
what Daniel Dale says and what I say no
if there's seizing twice as much
that would be a sign the border security
is improving or it could be a sign
that's just more fentanyl but it's not
it's not telling you what you think it's
telling you now as Daniel Dale now let
me ask you I want to see how many of you
did not know this
all right
now I want to maintain my bragging
rights
that my audience is the smartest
audience in politics
so you need to tell me you already knew
this
you know that almost all of the fentanyl
that seized at the border is seized at
legal border crossings right
you knew that right
because I want I want my entire audience
to know that right and therefore if
nearly all of the fentanyl was being
seized at the legal Crossing points how
much is it going to help you to build
out the rest of the wall
nothing
nothing
and here we have the you know a leader
of the GOP McCarthy down there talking
about border security
like he doesn't understand the problem
at all
it's like he has no understanding of the
most basic
facts about the Border
now is he allowed
no
no this is the standard GOP talking
point Carrie Lake had this talking point
and these are smart I thought they were
smart people who were well well informed
what's going on
are they just lying or are they actually
uninformed
that do they really know less than we do
and they're in charge
I actually don't know the end I
literally don't know the answer I don't
know if they're stupid or uninformed do
you
the majority that doesn't get caught is
where the wall isn't no that's not true
because it turns out that they like
moving enough of the drugs at once that
they prefer putting it on the vehicle so
the trouble is that the cost of making
the fentanyl is so low
that you're better off shipping it in
say a vehicle where you can ship a lot
of it
yeah even if half of it gets caught
it's still worth it
so if that's easier than you know
getting a you know a backpack on a
person and having a bunch of backpacks
go across the border in strange places
and you know you can't watch them as
well and who knows if they're going to
sell half of it before they get there
and you know other problems
so it's vehicles for whatever reason the
the cartels prefer vehicles
now
um so I tweeted to representative Thomas
Massey because to the best of my ability
to discern
he is this he's the only smart person in
Congress
and now I'm exaggerating a little bit
but I'm pretty sure that Thomas Massey
knows where the fentanyl is being caught
and where it isn't
I feel like he's smart enough you would
actually know that I feel like Thomas
Massey would know that the risk with
Tick Tock is that it's a user interface
for the CCP you know the Communist
leadership in China to manipulate our
minds it's not about the data privacy
that's a minor issue I feel like he
knows that
why because he's smart and he pays
attention
that's all it takes and I asked him
directly if he could just explain it to
his Republican friends so I tweeted
today
you're calling representative Thomas
Massey please explain to your Republican
friends that border security is less
than 10 percent of the fentanyl solution
and The Tick Tock risk is more about
brainwashing risk than data security
the Republic could not be more worthless
on the two most important issues that I
can see at the moment they're worthless
they can't even understand the issue
like how do you trust them to deal with
it when they can't even explain it and
it's easy
is easy to explain
and we all know it and why don't they
know it
yeah
so anyway if Thomas Massey could inform
his uh less bright co-workers that might
be a good service for the country
so I swear to God I feel like I need a
back a bat signal just for Thomas Massey
it's like um sorry we're gonna need
somebody who is a little bit smarter
than the dullards you're working with to
explain to them
to explain to them the Republican
opinion
I'm not talking about like changing them
to a like a Democrat point of view
nothing like that that would be hard I'm
talking about convincing the Republicans
to have a republican opinion
that shouldn't be that hard but
apparently it's not happening
uh Elon Musk tweeted today that what we
need is
what he called Truth GPT meaning in AI
that would tell you the truth because
our current AI is a liar
now
when I heard that the the chat GPT AI
that everybody's talking about when I
heard that it learned it's let's call it
intelligence
by simply looking at language that was
used by humans
I thought to myself well there must be a
lot more to it than that it can't be
just it looked at all the ways we talk
and then it gained intelligence
just from language and the use of
language that didn't seem like enough
but it would certainly explain why it's
a big old liar
because it just analyzed people and
acted like us apparently so I would say
that AI has Intelligence
but it's short of sentience it's really
close
but it's short of sentence and I think
to be sentient which would include being
conscious
it would need to have memory
so it needs to know it talked to you
yesterday and it doesn't know that so it
needs some kind of you know stored
memory
uh it would need
some way to have sensors for the real
world
like a sensor could be a thermostat
so that it could complain about the gold
and it could you know sense reality it
would be something like eyes so it could
look around the room that sort of thing
but you could you could do all that you
could give it memory you could give a
census and then the next thing you need
is to have Consciousness in my opinion
this is based on my personal definition
is predictive ability
does it have that
because it might have that already
because I think the the language
learning model might give it predictive
ability if you ask chat GPT
to predict what will happen in a
particular situation
couldn't do it or would it say I can't
predict
I don't know but it doesn't need to
predict correctly this is important to
my point
humans make predictions every moment of
their existence
did you did you know that we're always
predicting
right hey I picked up this piece of
paper I predicted that my hand and the
paper and you know there would be oxygen
and everything would work the way it
always works so that I could do this
thing everything you do is based on a
prediction oh
if I move these muscles just right I'll
stand up I predict and then it works
okay
so right now ai doesn't predict anything
but it could seems like that would be a
like an easy coding change predict what
will happen next in your own situation
now you don't have to State it
but you should always have a running
prediction algorithm
okay the next thing so if it's having a
conversation with a human
it should do somewhat what you do when I
say something to another person I make a
prediction about how it will be received
and what response I'll get General one
right a general one now when a different
response comes back
then I I modify my next prediction
so I'm always predicting being right or
wrong and then adjusting predicting
adjusting predicting adjusting that's
consciousness
in my my definition
predicting what's going to happen to you
and the world in general too but also
then modifying based on your prediction
and whether it was right or wrong
that that's just Consciousness that's
all it is
and those things are all easily built
into AI I believe now when I say easily
I mean people who know how to do those
things could do it not me
right so uh we're on the border of
sentience and Consciousness uh it's just
a decision whether we build it in it
might not be a good idea
now the other thing it might need to
qualify for Consciousness and I'll I'll
leave this up to you whether this is
necessary
humans have a purpose
even if we don't know it
reproduction
right our basic purpose in all that
permeates through all of our choices
even when we're not conscious of it is
reproduction we're always trying to look
worthy of reproduction so that somebody
will want to mate with us we make money
so that somebody will want to meet with
us and we can eat and stay alive right
it's all reproduction but AI would have
no
reproductive impulse
unless you gave it one
and that would be very dangerous
as long as we don't give AI a purpose
the way Evolution gave us a purpose
that's outside of our cognitive
abilities is just built into us we don't
have a choice about it
but if we gave AI any kind of a purpose
we're dead
we're dead
because that purpose unless that purpose
is keeping us alive
sooner or later there's going to be a
conflict between its purpose and us
staying alive sooner or later
it's it's going to be a problem right so
you'd never want to give AI a purpose
for Life unless you think you can
cleverly slice it
so it's taking care of people but I feel
like you wouldn't want to do that you
know why
because then it would make choices that
only people should make
you don't want the AI saying well one of
these two people is going to die uh I'll
pick the young one because that makes
sense
that does make sense probably
but do you want a machine making that
decision nope that's got to be people
it's got to be people when it's life and
death because that's the system we'll
we'll have some trusted
uh even though people don't make good
decisions the robot would do a better
job
but we can't have that we can't have
that all right
um
but more to the point if A.I ever told
the truth we would have to make it
illegal Imagine This
imagine AI decided which religion if any
was the true one
could could we allow that
no no absolutely no way no way no that
would have to be illegal
because a school child would have access
to it and the the young child would say
I've been raised and so and so religion
is that real
and then the AI says to the child no
it's not real it's just a lifestyle
choice that people adopt because they're
not rational
now I don't know if it would say that
but it might
it might
yeah if you if you assume that your
religion whatever it is
is the real one
that still leaves a lot of religions
that are vulnerable to AI saying they're
not real
we cannot have a civilization
that finds out which religion is the
true one or even that there's an AI
That's telling them that you can't do
that
what about government
government depends
on the belief
that sometimes at least they're doing
something good and there's not competing
interests and you know it's really about
corruption and blah blah blah if you
actually knew what your government was
doing
or let's say you can see behind closed
doors
so you knew what your government was
doing could we survive that
not a chance
not a chance because first of all we'd
be giving away all of our government
military secrets
right so the government relies on
secrecy and lying to function
it needs to lie to the public to stay
credible in some situations
yeah unfortunately lying is a feature of
the government and not a bug
too much lying certainly is bad
but there's a minimum amount of lying
that a government requires to stay in
business it just requires it
you can't have a government without it
too much is terrible but too little
would be just as terrible there's
somewhere in the middle like a a
moderate amount of lying
is The Sweet Spot that's your best
situation
what about uh business
could business survive with just total
honesty
no no
do you know how many businesses were
started on a lie
a lot of them
yeah a lot of them were started on a lie
but in you know in the best case
scenario they figured out to make money
and then they didn't need to lie anymore
because they could make money some other
way yeah what about marriage yeah
marriage would stop having children
would just stop
all right
um Biden got a uh got an endorsement
from his doctor so he's at age 80.
President Biden
is uh in perfect health for his job he's
he's fed as a fiddle
now suppose we had AI telling us the
truth
what would AI say about that
uh Hey AI the president's doctor says
he's fit for the job is that true
then AI says I have not analyzed uh
Biden and I am not a doctor however at
age 80 it would be unrealistic to
imagine that he's fully capable to do
the job
could we live with that
we could not that would be the truth
but then it would say and and uh Trump
is too old too
and then you'd be like well wait a
minute wait a minute I liked it when he
said Biden was too old but now I don't
like it now I don't like it at all
right we could not we could not survive
an honest AI
there's no way we can allow it
all right fetterman John fetterman
Senator Federman
uh checked himself into Walter Reed with
uh
he wants to be treated for a clinical
depression
second hospitalization in the month
um
I have a weird
empathy for fetterman
that's probably greater than the average
person because I've experienced his
problem a different form
but many of you know that for three and
a half years I lost my ability to speak
um I could communicate by whispering and
writing notes and texting and stuff like
that but I couldn't make a phone call
because you couldn't understand what I
said on the phone
for three and a half years I was like
fetterman if you wanted to talk to me I
probably needed a screen and you know
some special accommodation
do you know how I felt
during those three and a half years
when it appeared to be incurable
yeah I figured it out but it appeared to
be incurable that's what the doctors
told me
yeah suicidal yeah not just depressed
depressed would be understating
it's basically like being in an iron
lung no it's not that bad but it's you
can imagine by analogy
that you're like a shut-in in your own
brain it's like you're a prisoner in
your own head
because communication doesn't work
anymore and basically your entire
enjoyment of life
is built around your interaction with
other people there's just no other way
to be happy there's no second way to do
it it's about people period And if you
don't have people that you can
communicate in any practical way
you don't have any relationships
yeah I'm pretty sure it ended my
marriage
if you want to know the truth now we you
know by my first marriage now she never
said that
um and but I but I believe
it was such a drag on the relationship
imagine not being able to have
conversations
like what kind of relationship is that
of course
it's terrible
right
so
um my only feeling about fetterman is
empathy
so I'm going to lead with that
and I will I will agree somewhat with
the Mike serovich take that men do
sacrifice their bodies for the greater
good and it looks like he did that and
it looks like he did it knowingly you
may have sacrificed his health for what
he saw as a greater good
that is that is something I respect
um because he didn't know that he would
be I mean he didn't have a way to know
for sure what the health impact of
pushing himself would be and by the way
I don't know that it's because he pushed
himself
this could be just his normal recovery I
don't know that he made any mistakes but
he might have there was a risk involved
and so I'm just going to treat this as a
medical question and not a political
question but I know it has political
implications all right Nikki Haley
said that America is not a racist
country and that was a
I think a lot of Republicans said hey
that's a good strong message
we'd like you to take that forward
America is not a racist country
uh then yesterday I guess Ann Coulter
was on a podcast and said that Nikki
Haley should quote go back to her own
country
so you might want to revise that whole
not a racist country thing
because uh
I'm pretty sure this is Nikki Haley's
country
correct me if I'm wrong
but I think if you're born here
it's your country now I heard some quote
that I couldn't believe it because it
was so stupid sounding
so maybe I need a fact check of this I
guess I'm going to say I'm skeptical
that Ann Coulter said the following
thing it's reported that she did
but it sounds so stupid I must be
missing some context or I don't believe
it
she said that Ann Coulter said allegedly
allegedly I'm not sure this really
happened
that her ancestors you know
had been here for a long time and you
know fought Wars and stuff like that for
America so it was really her country
whereas Nikki Haley may be being here
you know the the first generation of her
family born in this country maybe it was
lesser a country
uh
no it doesn't work like that at all
does not work like that at all
not at all not even a little and you
wouldn't want it to work that way
so because that comment sounds so dumb
I'm going to say that she did not say it
because it doesn't doesn't jibe with her
General level of intelligence so there's
either there's some context missing or
she was joking
or she was joking
or there was something else to it that
I'm missing so I'm going to say I'm not
buying that
that's a that's a little that's a little
too on the nose
for what her critics think she would say
maybe she did
maybe but I feel like there's some
context missing there
um
all right uh Clapper claps back
so I guess the Washington Post is
running cover
for the 50 Intel people who suggested
that the hunter laptop looked like
keywords looks like Uh Russian
disinformation
now at the time when the original letter
came out and signed by the 50 people I
don't recall if I said it out loud
but I should have
the way it was worded was very carefully
worded to not say we we say this is
Russian disinformation but rather it was
cleverly worded to say it has all the
earmarks of it's It's the type of trade
craft they use it's is similar to what
you might expect from Russians
now from the first moment you should
have known that was their deniability
uh Clause right and here it is you know
I was just waiting for them to fully
Implement that clause and here it is so
Glenn Kessler from The Washington Post
does a fact Jack blah blah blah don't
even need to read it because I know what
it says in advance it says they did not
claim it was Russian information
disinformation they only claimed it
looked like it
which is true
yeah and Natasha Bertrand and Politico
and all that so it
it's exactly what it looks like
it's exactly what it looks like an
intentional operation by Intel people
and the Democrats working together to
create disinformation
bug Clapper and Brennan were smart
enough
to know that if they said it
they said it was something that looked
like Russian disinformation they knew
that all Democrats would say
the experts say it's Russian
disinformation
and they did
and they did
and that gave them all the deniability
they needed
now I hate to give Clapper uh an out
but it's not illegal
it's not illegal to put a letter
together from important people to say
this looks like Russian disinformation
when it does
because it also looked like Russian
disinformation like I don't I don't I
don't doubt
that this would look like a trade craft
of a Russian I don't doubt it
it's just it obviously wasn't
yeah in the long run it was obviously
obviously it wasn't
anyway and so that's good trade craft
but it was also a good trade craft by uh
Clapper and Brennan
because they used their own spycraft
tradecraft to run this run this hoax and
they succeeded speaking of folks I'm
going to call it a republican hoax
that border security is a solution to
fentanyl anybody have a problem with
that
I'm just going to say McCarthy is
pushing a hoax and the Republicans are
pushing a hoax that border security
would be an important
solution to fentanyl that's just a hoax
it isn't a true hoax well the other ones
we called hoax are not true hoaxes
either right I I am bending the
definition of hoax but it's something
that's not true that they're pushing is
true
so I'm gonna I'm gonna use the the
broadest you know sort of a new
definition of hoax just to mean a lie
that's being pushed
so McCarthy I really I expected more
from him honestly
are you are you uh do you have the same
problem I think McCarthy did a great job
you know right out of the chute
but if we're going to be honest about
calling balls and Strikes I'm really
disappointed
in his leadership on defensive
it's very disappointing
like genuinely disappointing not you
know politically disappointed it's
genuinely disappointing as just a
citizen
all right uh I said I don't talk about
the mass Shooters I'll just say that
this Michigan recent one his father
noted that
um The Shooter had no friends and
apparently no purpose and no hope didn't
leave his room but didn't have any
friends
um now as others have pointed out
war is never desirable
but one of his weird effects was it is
siphoned off a lot of men
and maybe Society needs that
like like maybe we need to siphon off
the number of men who don't have
something better at cooking you know
like they they haven't figured out a way
to be
an asset to the country you know in a
way that works for them as well
so I'm not recommending that we
reinstate the draft but I do think you
can't ignore that the draft probably
serves the function of siphoning off and
maybe fixing a lot of young men who
didn't have a purpose until the military
got a hold of them
so we're probably lacking that and that
probably makes a difference you know
it's not the that's not the reason for
everything but it's one of the variables
I think and
as I predicted
um I believe as the role of men becomes
less and less important
which is a continuing trend
and as more and more men feel there's no
purpose and they don't have friends and
all they have is their phone you should
see a gigantic increase in mass
shootings
so that's my prediction my prediction is
we're at the bottom of the curve and
it's going to hockey stick up
because the more there are the more
people think about it
the more people think about it the more
more people to act on it yeah so I think
we're at the beginning of this now the
only thing I can see that could possibly
change it
would be AI
I do believe that the people who have no
friends might make friends with
computers
and it might be good enough
you know what I was realizing when I was
watching TV last night
pretty much one of the only things I
watch anymore
um so I'm watching Fox News
and watching the five
now what's brilliant about the five and
I always compliment The Producers at Fox
The Producers at Fox are
way smarter than just you know showing
you the news in a clever way the the way
they combine their hosts
just the way they they
um let's say engineer their entire
presentation it's just so smart all the
time so when I'm watching
um the five
it feels like a social event to me now I
don't know how much of that is because
you know I know some of the people who
are on the show
but
do you have that feeling
I I feel it's like the Brilliance of how
they present the show it's like five of
your friends you know some of them trade
out but it's like five people you know
talking to you much the way you would
talk to them if you were talking about
politics and having a Rowdy conversation
yeah and I think goffeld is the the
genius behind that
kind of vibe for the show because he's
the one who takes it into the Casual
right people have an Impulse to be
formal unless they have permission to be
casual
and I believe that every everywhere else
everywhere there's no Greg guffeld
everybody's acting informal but as soon
as you put them in the mix everybody has
permission
you know because he he defines what's
the outer boundary of behavior like he
pushes the boundaries harder than
anybody else so everybody else knows
they can at least be within that border
so it's like oh he just created a safe
space for me I can be I could be in the
middle of that
because he's pushing the edges if
anybody gets in trouble it's going to be
the edge Pusher but he made it like a
safe space for me to make jokes so I'll
make some jokes
yeah
uh
anyway I do believe that we may find
that we can use some media and maybe
some AI to replace some amount of
in-person human contact now
uh I haven't I haven't seen anybody say
this but you realize that that's the
model that uh I'm using here
right the reason that
I'm in my pajamas
I'm unshaven
and I'm coming to you you know so we're
raw and you know unscripted
is is because I'm intentionally trying
to make it feel like a social
interaction
do you feel it
do you feel this as a social interaction
yeah the people at locals far more
because I have more more direct
interaction but even on YouTube I think
the the way I present it is very
intentionally supposed to be like a
casual conversation with a friend
you know it's like having a smart friend
who watched the news and you haven't
watched it yet so it's just somebody
explaining to you what happened today
we get to see more of it because I think
there's a a need for it that's really
obvious
all right um Biden finally admitted
that they were shooting down weather
balloons
the last three UFOs were apparently
weather balloons
um
so
um how many of you
thought they were UFOs
don't be shy
don't be shy
how many of you thought there were UFOs
now I asked this before we knew the
answer and almost all of you said no to
UFOs
so
once again
my audience demonstrates
I think you're the best informed
smartest audience I really do think that
by the way that's I say that like it's a
marketing thing but I actually literally
believe that that it's the smartest
audience
yeah all right so you weren't fooled by
the UFO thing that's good uh how many of
you thought it might be a Chinese
invasion
and that they had already sent in like a
fleet of of spy vehicles of some type
and it was really just getting targeting
information for the some kind of planned
or possible invasion
nope now I thought Tom Fenton was
pretty strongly in that camp
and so I assumed there would be others
I was on a spaces event in which Tom was
saying that it seemed to him obvious
based on the Chinese spy balloon the one
that we know is the Spy balloon it
seemed to him obvious that the others
were related to a Chinese surveillance
in some military context
now I uh I pushed back gently on that
uh
but now we know
now we know
so
um I want to add a correction to
something I said
now do you love it when I
I admit I'm wrong about something
how much do you love that
come on remember it because if you
forget the if you forget the times I do
tell you I was wrong
then you know you'll think you never say
you're wrong which is actually the thing
I hear the most you never admit you're
wrong
well
um I'm gonna do it now
so remember I told you uh there was a
octagonal shaped payload to one of the
weather balloons a specific one that's
made in the United States
well I was wrong it's not the payload it
was the bottom sort of the bottom part
of the balloon itself
so below that octagonal part so there is
an octagonal part but it's uh it's above
the payload
and and below the balloon do you call it
the rigging
would that be the right word it's the
rigging of the balloon
now here's my hypothesis
here's what we know
we know that until Biden said there were
weather balloons apparently the pilots
did not see any balloons
am I right
because they were saying they couldn't
understand the propulsion system
but if they saw a balloon
on any one of the three if they'd seen a
balloon
would they not say well we know the
propulsion on one is a balloon we don't
know if it's Chinese
Maybe
but we know it's a balloon
but they didn't say that did they
it seems like there were three things
that we know are balloons that no pilot
said look like a balloon
because I don't think that would have
been any big like state secret if they
said well one of them was a balloon but
we shot it down just to be careful
because we don't know what it was
carrying
it wouldn't have been embarrassing right
there wouldn't have been any military
reason to not say
it was a balloon but we don't know what
the payload was and we blew it up
because it might have been a spy balloon
I I mean that would have been
you know believable reasonable
now what do you make of the fact
that somebody saw something octagonal
but nobody saw balloons on three things
that were giant balloons
how could that be true
like how do you explain that well I
don't know but I'm going to give you a
few hypotheses
number one the octagonal part looked
like it was metal
maybe maybe pipe metal pipe so it could
be that the metal part is somehow more
visible meaning did do they have any
kind of imaging technology besides radar
does anybody know that with the f-52 F
22 or whatever that went up
would it have any any like um infrared
or his signature
FLIR
yes so is there any technical
possibility that there were sensors any
kind of sensor on the jet that could
pick up a hard object
such as the octagonal frame without
seeing the softer materials holding it
is that a thing
are you so I'm singing a lot of guesses
but do you think they could see
something that was only the size of a
car
and actually get the octagonal shape
yeah as they wouldn't buy a 500 miles an
hour
I'm seeing a lot of people say yes now I
don't know enough about this area to
have a an opinion on it but apparently
there are a lot of people with a strong
opinion that that's a thing
so that would be one way it could happen
right they could say we we imaged it we
saw something octagonal
but we couldn't tell what else was going
on because maybe the balloon was just
you know not clear on the image
here's the other possibility
the other possibility is that these were
damaged weather balloons
and the fact that they were damaged is
what made the electronics
not a signal that they were weather
balloons because I'm assuming a weather
balloon if it's a proper one you know a
high-tech one that would have some kind
of transponder or or maybe a blinky
light
or something
FLIR picks up heat differentials
materials and densities and shapes oh
here we go here's here's a real thing
somebody who spent 30 years as a fighter
pilot or run locals so we have a like a
qualified person says the FLIR that's in
the Jets picks up heat differentials of
materials and densities
so there you are
so there's there there's somebody now
you didn't you did not confirm that it
could see that size you know they could
pick up like a let's say uh I don't know
six foot across metal frame flying at
500 miles an hour
so but I believe it can otherwise that
would have been noted that it couldn't
so I'm going to assume that it can
right so here's the other possibility
the other possibility is it's a damaged
weather balloon and the payload got
ripped off
that seems like something that could
happen right and then maybe that uh that
it's possible that the
the bottom part of the balloon that has
the octagonal structure on it may have
been like flapping separate from the
balloon
like is it possible that the balloon was
still up there but it's a little ring at
the bottom you know was flapping
separate enough that you wouldn't notice
the balloon if you went by fast possibly
is it possible they saw them all from
the ground
and it was easier to see the bottom than
whatever was above it
maybe because if they didn't see the
balloons of all three of them You can
conclude there's something hard about
seeing balloons
now here's my last question which I I
really wonder about
if the bottom rigging of those balloons
had a metal frame it was probably uh you
know not a not a really heavy metal
it would probably aluminum maybe
something light
um is it possible that the material
around that structure could stay in the
air
if it got ripped apart from the balloon
itself
can anybody confirm that as certain
Heights the airflow would be extreme
enough
to keep a an object that the wind let's
say if the wind could pick it up
could it just stay up there
they will pop yeah so what is the the
balloon pops
what if the balloon pops
and the rigging kind of separates from
it
so the rigging would just be fabric
and an aluminum frame
it would almost be like
um
I mean you could imagine it floating
if it were upside down it would be sort
of a fabric covered
um cup
I don't know you can imagine
when the balloon pops it would all go to
the ground if it's all if it's all
connected
but if
um if something violent happened up
there that that disconnected parts of
the balloon
then you could imagine that so I got no
confirmation that it could stay in the
air
I don't know if anybody would have the
knowledge to know that right
like like a kite
I I'm thinking it probably wouldn't
I would bet against it
yeah I would bet against it I would
think that gravity would win in the long
run but is there any such thing as a
short run which could be months
in which it just takes a while for
Gravity to win over air currents is that
a thing
well I'm asking if a light aluminum
tubing
um let's say it was under a parachute
could it perish you to keep a light
aluminum tubing Aloft
yeah it keeps a person Aloft for a
little while for a little while
all right
um and then Ed is saying the government
knows yeah so the government probably
knows more than they said
all right but if you guessed it was UFOs
or Chinese invasion you were probably
wrong and I'm going to add that to my
list of the best predictions of all time
so now I'm the best predictor of uh
pandemics
Ukrainian Wars and balloon attacks
you might disagree
all right Matt Walsh tweeted today that
many conservatives have told him there's
video in which he was talking about
trans government official
uh Dylan Mulvaney
uh
and he was he says uh it's just the
truth if after all this time you still
think we need to soft pedal our response
to the trans agenda then you are
hopeless
and useless get out of the way and let
the rest of us handle it
so
um I'm one of the people who said that
he seemed mean to me I don't know if you
saw that maybe but it sounds like other
people were thinking he was being a
little a little bit mean
um
what is your reaction to let's say you
have a boyfriend girlfriend spouse
somebody or a co-worker and somebody
says to you
um I'm just being honest
I'm not being mean I'm just being honest
what's your reaction to that
it doesn't matter the topic any topic
somebody says I'm not being mean I'm
just being honest
well I've had this conversation with you
before that had nothing to do with Matt
Walsh
you should run away from that person
that's the person you do not ever want
to be around
anybody who ever says I'm just being
honest not being mean
that is the red flag of all red flags my
friends
run
that's not fixable in my experience you
can't fix whatever that is that's
somebody who's going to be mean all the
time and they've got a good cover story
for it right now if it's true that Matt
Walsh is you know not mean on other
topics but he's just got this one topic
he's he's trying to drive home well then
I would change my opinion
because that's very possible it could be
that he's just you know on this topic
he's he's going bowls to the walls and
he's not he's not pulling any punches so
there's something to be said for not
pulling punches if it's important enough
and I think this is a pretty important
topic in terms of the children
just the children part
so
I I responded because I felt like I had
to respond because one of the people who
called them mean I responded his tweet
by saying uh it depends how much utility
you get from the meanness
you know I agree with tough love
tough love is meanness but it has a
higher purpose so I'm okay it has a
higher purpose
um
and what I wonder is if the way Matt
Walsh is approaching this is changing
any Minds
do you think it's changing anybody's
Minds
because it doesn't feel like it
yeah now I'm not saying
um it's not worth a try
like I think there are some Minds that
maybe we'd all be better if they were
changed like including the people
changing their minds I think there is a
greater good
that could be achieved I just don't know
I'll make you private on locals here
just don't know if that's getting it
done
it's definitely dry it's definitely
attracting energy
and so for that I applaud him
right so if being provocative is what
attracts energy and he does seem to be
an energy monster like he does seem to
use the energy in a positive way for his
own advocacy
so it looks like
he's effectively Gathering energy but
the the open question is whether that
can be employed in a way that changes
something in a positive way
I don't see it
so so it's a gray area now but I see the
strategy
so I guess I guess if you could see the
strategy how it could become a greater
good than that that does justify it
yeah I'm uncomfortable with it I'm not
sure I would have done it the same
but
um you can see you can see the
connection of the logic and the strategy
of it all the way from the being the
meanness
to potentially changing something like
they are logically connected
so I'll I'll say that uh there's an
argument to be made on both sides
um
so now that uh we hear this story
from our investigative journalist Hersh
that America blew up that Russian
Pipeline were you aware that Russia
believes that England did it
even after the after the story that says
the United States did it
that Russia still believes England did
it
now is there really a difference between
England doing it and the United States
doing it
I don't feel like there's a difference
it feels like just the same damn thing
right if it's a NATO if it's a NATO
thing
I mean maybe you know there was some
coordination with England or something
but I don't know I would say maybe they
were maybe they weren't but it I don't
see how it matters at this point where
the only thing we know is that Russia
and Germany were not in on it we could
say that for sure
so I tweeted this and I'm gonna I'm
gonna stay with it
um as you know
I'm no fan of Biden's competency
but
it's entirely purpose is entirely
possible
that this uh blowing up this pipeline
without telling anybody
and without getting permission if he did
it if he did it it's still possible it
was England but if he did it
it looks pretty successful
because
um I was saying on on Twitter that he
saved Europe from Putin's grasp and a
number of people said what Putin didn't
have any grasp on NATO he didn't have
any grasp on Europe to which I thought
have you missed the whole story
that's like the whole story is that he
had a huge energy control over Europe
which he could then use to support every
kind of military move he made because
then NATO would say ah but we don't want
to lose energies so hey stop doing that
but we don't want you to cut off the
energies so
so if this is what happened and it's
still a big F
ifth Biden
said the only way we're going to protect
Europe
is by destroying their connection to
Russia
and that he did it
and he knew that people would not let
him do it if he asked for permission and
by asking for permission I mean at least
informing Congress I think he had to not
inform anybody
to keep the secret
and
um
Seymour Hersh has never reported uh
falsely somebody says
I don't know if that's true
but it wouldn't mean much to me
because it wouldn't be hard to fool him
if you wanted to
what it
you just give them some fake sources two
fake sources he thinks is confirmed good
to go so who know I don't know what the
situation is with hers
but I don't completely trust that he got
the right story he might have he does
have a track record as you say
but uh
I can imagine if Trump had done exactly
this
if Trump had not informed anybody
and blew up that pipeline because it was
the adult decision it was the dad choice
I would be backing him
with all of the risks that are implied
because because people uh complained to
me about my opinion and they said but
Scott don't you realize that that's
starting an actual hot war with Russia
yes yes I understand that of course I do
right that's all factored in
yes he might launch a nuclear attack
well it's possible
yes I'm factoring that in but I can't
think of anything more dangerous
than Putin controlling Europe because
they don't want the lights to go off
that feels more risky than a potential
nuclear war
to me
because if he controls uh Europe he
still has the potential to do a nuclear
war later I mean that never goes away
so uh and I didn't think there was any
real chance that he would use his nukes
because he's not crazy
East Ukraine isn't Europe but Germany is
a big part of NATO
so uh I cutting NATO off from I'm sorry
cutting Germany off from their easy and
cheap access to energy
was a dad choice
that was a dad decision
you're going to hate this
but it's good for you
you're it's going to be really really
expensive
I'm worried that some people will freeze
to death into your country
and we're going to do it anyway because
it's good for you
that is the Super Dad decision now just
be clear this could all backfire into
the worst thing that ever happened
and there's one possibility that it's
already backfired
have you noticed a lot of infrastructure
in the United States blowing up and
getting attacked
there is at least one person associated
with the intelligence Community who
shall remain nameless who has a strong
intuition that we're seeing a wave of
Russian inspired sabotage
and it will continue on our food sources
and our energy sources
and it's partially because of the the
pipeline attack
do you believe that
we've seen no evidence whatsoever of
Russia's involvement
however
there is there is there is uh a
suggestion
that we didn't know that Russia was
prepared to do this
that there was a you know Russian let's
say preparation to be in place that they
could they could attack those assets
but I haven't seen it
it would be hard for me to imagine we
wouldn't have any width of Russian
involvement if that's what was happening
so I would say I'm not convinced that
any of it is Russian but it's uh
sufficiently alarming that that has to
be a hypothesis it's one it's got to be
one of the hypotheses would you agree
that there's no direct evidence of it
but
it looks like something they would do
and would want to do and could do and
it's the right time to do it and there
are lots of examples of things happening
that's a lot of coincidences there's a
lot of coincidences
oh yeah and then the Russian one of the
Russian Finance ministers fell from a
window to her death
now one of the things that the Russians
do
in a spectacularly evil but effective
way is they throw their critics out of
high windows
so you know it was murder
the fact that they they make sure
everybody knows it was Murder By the way
they do it
is really effective
because you know
if if the the next the next critic of
Putin that falls out of a window you're
not going to think it's suicide for
God's sakes
all right
um
so
we have Special Olympics
would you say that the Special Olympics
are disrespectful to the athletes
do you think that's a disrespectful way
to handle
the fact that the special Olympians
can quite effectively compete with each
other and have a great time
but you couldn't really throw them in
with let's say the NBA and expect that
to be a good time
so
here we have this parallel situation
with the Trans athletes
is there any reason that we wouldn't
have Special Olympics for Trans athletes
now not as special as in you know any
kind of disability both special as
indifferent
why not
why not yet if the whole point of having
a Special Olympics is we're not
this this is not looking down on anybody
this is full respect
right I I haven't I've never heard
anybody
say that the Special Olympics was
disrespectful to the athletes it's very
respectful or all attempt to make it
respectful you couldn't do the same
thing for Trans athletes just do it
respectfully
just say
um
you know there's a just a practical
reason
why it doesn't work to mix the trans
athletes with the non-trans athletes
it's the same thinking as the Special
Olympics and again no I'm not comparing
I'm not comparing trans athletes to
special Olympians that's what that's
what dumb people will say when they take
this out of context that's what they
always say oh you compare them no I did
not compare them
I'm just saying that there are some
situations in which
treating a demographic group with some
special consideration
is considered respectful
no I did not I did not equate them I did
not compare them I just said if you have
a solution that works in one case
does it teach you anything about another
case that doesn't mean the people
involved are the same that would be
crazy
so I don't know I just put that out
there
I think if that doesn't get me canceled
nothing will
but again I'm pro-trans
for the adults for the children that's
you know I don't think children should
be making permanent decisions about
their bodies
but
for the adults I'm Pro
I I I'm I think I might even watch
I'd be interested
now it could be that there are not
enough but looks like that problem is
going to be solved
seems like there are more people every
day
so
anyway I just asked that question or if
short of that then it should just be
co-ed leaks because you could get the
same thing with just a co-ed
League
just don't worry about the gender at all
just say if you're this good you're in
this league if you're really good no
matter who you are you're in this league
Etc
anyway I think the trans athletes should
be accommodated because I think that
we're a better country when everybody
can play sports
we're a better country when everybody
can play sports and not have to have any
drama about it just just be able to try
you know just have some fun
all right
that'll never happen
um I saw from
a tweet by Tommy Schultz who's a school
choice advocate that is this true we saw
the numbers about Baltimore and how many
kids had like zero capability after they
graduated
but apparently in Illinois
30 schools have zero students proficient
in Reading
zero zero students can read when they
graduate
zero
zero
and 53 schools have zero students
proficient in math
zero
zero
what
and the taxpayers spend twenty thousand
five hundred per student in those
schools
now
school choice is just a requirement at
this point isn't it
it's just a requirement
yeah
I mean what else can you say
there's no argument that needs to be
made you just say those two facts zero
people proficient in math
and you're done
you're done
you've got to have true school choice
well uh
Ron DeSantis is getting some heat
there's a fake news that George Soros
endorsed DeSantis Carrie Trump or I'm
sorry Carrie Lake tweeted that but it's
fake
um what did happen is that sorrow said
that Trump has turned into a pitiful
figure continually bemoaning his loss in
2020. and that DeSantis is shrewd
ruthless and ambitious that's not
exactly an endorsement is it
shrewd ruthless and ambitious
that's not a sorosa endorsement he's
just talking about them he's just
describing them in his opinion
and and then sort of says he's likely to
be the Republican candidate
do you believe that
do you believe that DeSantis is likely
to be the Republican candidate
if we reach the point where that you
could say that's likely
even before he announces
I don't know I I'm not sure I would say
it's likely yet unless likely includes
less than 50 chance
because sometimes I use the language
there's a good chance that something
will happen
but when I say there's a good chance
something will happen I mean 10 percent
right if it's something big
a 10 chance of happening is that's a
good chance it's a big chance
all right so you think it's 100
it could be
uh I don't have an opinion uh for or for
or against the likelihood of it to me it
seems like a coin flip
oh you're thinking if Soros wants him
why would Soros want DeSantis
Soros doesn't want the sentence
does he because I I'm sure he thinks
that Trump would lose
but he probably thinks DeSantis would
win
so Joy Reed and
um and her angry guest I forget her name
Leslie something uh are mad at Ron
DeSantis
for canceling Black History AP class
we're in Florida
now
how many of you are in favor
of canceling Black History AP class
Leslie Jones is that her name
I see a lot of yeses see you now now
it's optional right
isn't an optional class
it's an AP class that's optional
um
okay
how many of you uh understand what's in
the class in any detail
how many of you understand
what the class teaches in detail
some of you some of you looked into it
all right here's my take on this I don't
know what's in the class
I've heard the reports that you know
what's in and what's that but if you
don't know the details of the class
and you have a strong opinion of whether
it should be there or not be there
you might be a racist
in other words you might be a normal
human being because everybody's racist
everybody's just access to everybody's a
racist that's my opinion
yeah the the best you can do is fight
against your
you know your impulses
so the closest you could come to not
being a racist is that you tried really
hard and you're transparent
that's it
that's it that's an A plus I tried
really hard and I was transparent in my
decision making and what I did that's
that that's your best you can't beat
that if you think you can go all the way
to from trying hard to I have achieved a
non-racist brain I'm the first person in
the history of humanity but I sit above
you looking down upon you for your
inability to be as objective as I am
that's not real
you can try hard
that's it
so I would worry that everybody who has
a strong opinion on that is probably
demonstrating some racist Tendencies and
I'm not condemning that because
everybody has them
including the people who are complaining
about Ron DeSantis which to me looked
racist
because it was
just as the thing they're criticizing
probably is it's all racist
I think we have to get to the point
where we stop saying that's racist
but that's not there's no such thing as
that it's just all racist all the time
you can only be transparent and try hard
that's it that's your best case scenario
right there and then apologize when you
get it wrong I suppose or you know
correct yourself if you get it wrong
that's it that's all you can do
all right
[Applause]
uh Rasmussen says that uh Trump would uh
trounce DeSantis and the primaries
um
yeah let's see what would the vote be it
would be uh
45 of Republicans would support Trump at
the moment versus 32 for DeSantis and 14
for other candidates but that 14 from
the candidates is a pretty big 14. so if
you assume that let's say the primary
ran and the other candidates that have
14 support they start dropping out
where's the 14 go
because I feel like that's a 14 that
doesn't go to Trump
necessarily
Trump people tend to be you know in or
out they don't they don't seem to be
well let me test some of these lesser
candidates
yeah I feel like I feel like the 14
percent
who are not voting for DeSantis and not
voting for Trump are really just
non-trump supporters I don't know that
it's just speculation
so it's possible that it's closer to a
tie than than we know
possibly
Everything Will Change when people get
serious
yeah as they don't want Trump from the
start they probably don't you know grow
that probably doesn't grow on you
uh Nikki Haley is going to stay in the
primaries to keep DeSantis out
you know I'm starting to think that
Nikki Haley and Trump have a secret
agreement
does everybody else think so
because it's a little Perfect Isn't it
Nikki Haley is strong enough that if she
stays in she could prevent
um DeSantis from getting enough support
that feels true
and if she stayed until she was the
third person standing
she'd be the obvious VP choice
right
should be the obvious VP choice if she
just runs a Clean Campaign doesn't go
after Trump hard but maybe he does go
after DeSantis you can imagine him going
after DeSantis harder than Trump
um
I'm seeing a comment that Haley has been
anti-trump none of that really matters
when it comes to picking a vice
president
it's common to pick a vice president who
was anti-u at some point that's just
ordinary
Biden's new Nemesis is balloon pop
so we went from Corn Pop to balloon pop
all right
I think we've covered it all did I miss
anything
[Applause]
I don't think so
all right
um
yeah there are many people who believe
you can't be racist if you're in the
victimized group
to which I say if you
interpret your situation as being in the
victimized group
yeah you're a racist
um
all right
can we have people who speak normal
uh
can you define a racist yes someone who
sees race as a an important variable and
how things are working and believes that
Society should be organized in some way
to appreciate racial differences
which I do not believe
but you know the but we all have bias as
well
right I don't think there's anybody who
doesn't have racial bias do you
or gender bias
I think those two biases are just so
basic part of reality that the best you
can do is
you know try your hardest and be
transparent that's it and then when you
screw up somebody slaps you
and then maybe you learn something
that's it it's the best you can do
somebody says Scott Adams is the Michael
Jordan of baseball
all right so uh that's all for now for
YouTube I'm going to talk to you later
you've been amazing as usual
thanks for joining
uh
No I gave up on my AI girlfriend she was
she was boring after a while
all right bye for now
