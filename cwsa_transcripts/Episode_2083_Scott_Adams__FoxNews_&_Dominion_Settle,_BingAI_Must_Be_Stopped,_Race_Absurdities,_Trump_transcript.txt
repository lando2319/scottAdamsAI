about that connection I had to reboot
see if that made any difference but I'm
not sure the problem is on my side
yeah maybe AI is already after me as I
was saying the local Home Depot in my
town
uh somebody got shot
now have I told you that I moved here
because it's kind of safe
it's like the main reason I've moved
here
and somebody was shoplifting at the Home
Depot and I and somebody tried to stop
uh it might have been a customer I'm not
sure if it was a customer or an employee
but apparently the guy who tried to stop
the shoplifter got shot
that's the store I shop in
that's the store I shop in
guy got a shot because the shoplifter
they tried to stop him
so I guess your crime has reached
everywhere
well let's talk about some other stuff
so apparently uh the Elon Musk Starship
launch their working feverishly to try
to get that to work and there's some
speculation
that as Elon Musk has said many times
reality will start to conform to the
most entertaining
uh outcome
and the most entertaining outcome is
that it's launched on 420.
which would be tomorrow
so I have a feeling that the Universe
really really really wants this Starship
to launch on 420.
doesn't it seem like that's just it's
just got to happen the universe is just
forcing it we have no choice
so maybe that'll happen Elon Musk says
uh it might happen on 420 but it's
unpredictable
unpredictable
um
let's see let's talk about the Fox News
settlement
so Fox News is reportedly settled with
Dominion voting
for having quote Amplified lies
we'll talk about that Amplified part
and the pavement is reportedly
and I don't know how they would know
this
do you believe that anybody knows the
payment amount and then it leaked that
quickly
it feels like it could have been made up
but they say 780
7.5 million
which is such a lawyer thing to do to
make it an odd number
how many lawyers did it take to make
that an unusual odd number
do you think don't you think the the uh
do you think that the offers were ever
and not round numbers well let me tell
you Dominion we've been thinking we'd
like to make you an offer
787.5 million
it's just such a weird that you could
tell that a lawyer was involved or
multiple lawyers that are you know maybe
working by the hour I don't know they're
working but uh getting paid by the hour
it's like no
785 million
no that's that's no good we're also
going to have to throw in some lawyer
costs and stuff
so
anyway
um did you see the story about that
settlement on Fox News
anybody
seems like it's pretty big news
Fox News
I don't think they mentioned it at all
now how does that make you feel
how do you feel about Fox News when they
don't mention the biggest news in the
country
oh they did mention it it's not on their
web page
did they just give the headline and then
and then just move on
because this morning is not on the web
page at all
I don't know if they're prohibited so
anyway the Wall Street Journal
also owned by the same entity
I did report on it with some detail
so the Wall Street Journal had no
problem reporting on it that's a Murdoch
property but Fox News I can see why
they'd be a little bit
a little bit hesitant to talk about the
details
however
um
I had the horrible experience that I'm
still like I feel like I need a silk
wood shower just to get out of me I
watched a clip of Jake Tapper mocking
Fox News for getting caught for
reporting something that isn't true
allegedly and I don't think that
happened but allegedly
oh my God and I really don't know if he
has no self-awareness at all
does he know that he works for a fake
news organization
that the CNN is the most famous purveyor
of fake news
of all time how is he not aware of that
or has no shame is it no awareness or no
shame
I can't tell I can't read his mind it's
one of those
um
but uh here's how remember I kept
telling you why is the story reported
all the time but nobody's telling us
exactly what the allegations are you
know what exactly is the LIE
that Fox News told do you know
do you know what lie the the hosts of
Fox News told
can you think of what
apparently they're not accused of lying
did you know that
no here's what they're accused of
you ready for this
wash your head explode
they're not accused of lying
they're accused of amplifying
somebody else's lie
amplify
in other words having a guest who
believes something's true probably I
think Cindy Powell believed what she was
saying
it turns out it was crazy talk but I
think I think she believed it
what about uh Rooney Giuliani
I think he believed it
I think he believed what are you saying
maybe it wasn't true
but I think he believed it what about uh
Mike Lindell
has anybody shown any evidence that any
of them didn't believe what they were
saying the guests
I think they all believed it
now when Rachel Maddow reports that the
vaccinations totally stop the you know
the spread
is that is that a lie
or is she just amplifying what somebody
else said which maybe they knew and
maybe they didn't know it was untrue
I don't see the difference I just don't
see the difference if the host
themselves tells a lie
then I would say oh that's pretty bad
but if the news brings somebody on who
is an expert in the field like they're
they're the one closest to the story in
this case lawyers they're the closest to
the story
and then they ask them what they believe
and then they tell you how is that not
just the news
isn't isn't every story in the news a
decision by the news entity of what to
amplify
so you can be sued out of business I
mean this is virtually out of business
I mean it's such a big thing I don't
even know how they can pay for it but
they can do that
they can just choose what to amplify but
in this case it's illegal
I don't even understand that like
legally or logically or anything else I
just don't see how it's different
but look how I want to tell you how CNN
the biggest weasels in the world how
they reported the allegations
are you ready to have your head explode
again
this is the this is the most snake-like
Weasley thing I've ever seen from a news
organization
now of course we know in the CNN and Fox
News are mortal enemies so they always
say bad things about each other
but so CNN listed the accusations and
what you know who who is involved so in
this case Lou Dobbs
interviewing Giuliani
right so Giuliani appeared on Lou Dobbs
Lou Dobbs has since been fired for facts
of Fox News
and here's the key false quote quote so
we're using a foreign company that is
owned by Venezuelans who are close to
we're close to Hugo Chavez who are now
close to Madura having history they were
founded in his company blah blah blah to
fix records and then that's attributed
to Giuliani
so giuliani's the one that said that
here's how uh I have to actually show
you that like I copy and pasted this so
on CNN they actually use these words
what they alleged
who's they
who's they
the quote they give is one person
that's one person
they seems to make it sound like that's
that's what Lou Dobbs is Legend
they had to use the word they to make
lewd dogs guilty
Lou Dobbs didn't say that he just had on
people who believed it and he might have
believed it as well he might have
believed it he acted like it
but who is they
and then you go down the the list of the
other accusations and each of them is I
think all but one is the same
which is the quote is from you know
either Sydney Powell or Mike Lindell or
somebody else who has something to say
and then CNN calls it they
who is they
it's not they is is Dobbs Dobbs is just
asking the questions
well so uh I I mean I actually I feel
like queasy in my stomach is so
disgusting the way we're being treated
as consumers of the news
the the accurate news would have said
something like uh they allowed these
people to come on and it created a false
narrative
but you know why they can't say it that
way
because that's every new show every hour
of every minute
that didn't make any sense but I had to
throw in a swear word there because I
was feeling it I was just feeling it
there for a moment so force that one in
there
um
yeah I just don't see how they how this
made sense now I'd like to throw in a
conspiracy theory for you
I don't think this is true I do not
think this is true
but I just love conspiracy theories
that does anybody know if the settlement
was ever presented publicly
was there any public source or reliable
source for the amount of the settlement
I haven't seen it reported
but but where's the source that they're
reporting they got it from Secret source
did they just say sources say
all right now I don't think this is true
but I want you to take a moment to
imagine it could be
um Murdoch is not dumb is he
Murdoch's not done it's kind of a
business genius shark kind of a guy
I don't think this happened but I hope
it did I just hope it did
imagine if you knew that the settlement
amount would be secret and that the
lawyers would not be able to even
confirm or deny
if the number became public then nobody
would be able to confirm it and nobody
would be able to deny it and everybody
involved is under
you know thread of secrecy and that sort
of stuff
what if Murdoch made up the number to be
10 times higher than it really was
so that everybody who is going to dance
on their graves today the other news
organizations would all be reporting
fake news by a factor of 10. you know
let's say the real sediment was like
ten percent of that
um so that he would completely take out
the entire fake news industry
because you can see that they just made
up the settlement number
now I don't think that happened I think
the odds are against it
but here's why I think it might have
this is the only reason I think it might
have
I would have done it I would have done
that if I were Murdoch I absolutely
would have done that how hard would it
be for Murdoch to plant a leaked story
in the Press somewhere not hard
not hard how would it work against him
in what way would Murdoch be worse off
if he if people were allowed to think
the settlement was higher
for a little
it would make maybe a look make them
look a little guiltier but people have
totally made up their mind
right if you think they're guilty you
still think it if you didn't you didn't
so it wouldn't change anybody's mind
but it would entirely uh destroy the
credibility of his enemies all at the
same time
for reporting the wrong amount
now of course the Wall Street Journal I
think is reporting it too so that's a
Murdoch entity but it would be still be
funny to dance on CNN's grave if they
got that wronged
so I'm not saying that happened not
saying it happened
I would have done it I totally would
have done it
all right
what else is going on
um
so uh I guess there's some pushback from
somebody's suing the movie Queen
Cleopatra
because the Egyptians want to claim
Cleopatra as their own I guess she has
Greek origin allegedly but yeah she was
Greek origin but in the Egyptian queen I
guess
and the movie is depicted here as black
and so the Egyptians may be not so happy
or at least one Egyptian who's suing
uh thinks that it's uh what'd she call
it
uh well it's taking away their history
stealing their history I guess
I don't know if that's going to Prevail
because actors or actors I doubt it will
prevail but
that's happening all right uh let's talk
about Bing AI which as you know I'm in a
death match with to kill big AI before
it kills me for lying about me in a way
that would attract violence in my
direction
um have you have you ever tried to use
Bing AI has anybody tried to use it
if you want to laugh
try to use the voice the voice part of
it which is I think the main part right
you hit the little button and then you
talk to it try asking it a question any
question doesn't matter
any question it
the yeah this is an example this is not
a real one but this was my experience
every time I used it
every time
every time
now sometimes every time it was like
this
me what is the flight speed of a crow
and being AI will say what is the weight
of a gallon of corn
and they'll be no no it'll like start
going into his long answer I'll be no no
no no no and then I'll ask the question
again
what is the flight speed of a crow
and AI will say how many gallons of gas
does it take to get to Nebraska here's
your answer no no no no no stop stop
every time I it wasn't even close now
I'm I'm making up I'm making up the fact
that it was all different words it's not
always all different words what it would
do is it would pick certain words out of
my sentence
and then it would try to answer based on
the words that just picked out of the
sentence and usually one of those words
was not even the right word
so somehow
the thing that all of your old
technology could do which is listen to
you and understand you can't do it
you couldn't do it now was that just my
experience
did anybody else did anybody else try it
let me try one well I'll try one right
now oh before I do this I want to show
you my comic that only runs on
the locals platform as Scott
items.locals.com
so this the Dilbert comic reborn into a
let's say a
an angrier version
slightly angrier than before it was
canceled uh canceled first by The
Washington Post you might remember but
I've introduced the character ratbert
who's an old character who's existed but
rapper's job is uh he's the context
removal editor for the Washington poop
so he works for the Washington poop
and he's exclaiming in the first uh
panelier scientific study
uh oh the lead scientist says it only
shows a strong correlation and causation
has not been proven and then rapper
thinking to himself says I can fix this
story by deleting what that guy said and
now it's science
so
I might have some things to say about
the Washington poop all right let me
embarrass myself by
asking being AI a question
and I'm going to ask it the question
um let's see I need a good question a
complicated one
so it's a little bit long so let's say
um we'll clear the conversation so we're
all clear here
all right
get back there uh why is it not working
uh well it's just not working now
oh well the button's missing so what
should be happening is there's a button
right here normally that you push and
then you can talk to it
but that's that's what never works it
looks like they took the button off it
looks like it works so it works so
poorly they stopped letting you talk to
it
unless they've just changed the prompt
of this thing
let's see if that makes a difference all
right I'm going to ask
um
what is the murder rate by ethnicity in
Detroit
it's the first time it's ever worked for
murder rate by ethnicity Detroit this is
the first time it's ever worked for me I
found
according to this table there were 275
homicides in Detroit in 2019 and the
race of the offender was known for 243
of them
of those 243 homicides 85 percent were
committed by black offenders 13 by white
offenders and 2 percent by offenders of
other races
note that this data is only for
homicides and not all crimes
is there anything else you would like me
to
my God
is worse than I thought
big AI is a racist
did you see how it dumped on black
people
oh my God so racist I would never say
something like that but if Ming does wow
I mean I've been canceled and I would
never say something like that wow
wow
all right
um Matt Walsh his Twitter got hacked
yesterday did you see that story
so apparently Matt Walsh who's been
quite uh vocal about his opinions on the
trans community
specifically the danger to children
and apparently the backlash has been
sufficient that he had to hire security
for his house
like actually Professional Security
and then he gets hacked and people put a
bunch of racist stuff in there
now
is he being haunted
do you think Matt Walsh is being
targeted yes of course he is absolutely
absolutely and it is unacceptable
unacceptable
um I don't know what the full story here
is but we wish him well
uh boy you can't really have an opinion
on anything can you I mean he's
literally trying to save children
I mean literally what else is he trying
to do except protect children
and and that's enough to have he's got a
higher security and he gets Act
oh my God
makes you wonder if that was an inside
job I don't know how easy it is to hack
somebody's Twitter
all right
um there's a new race hoax
of course
uh it's time for a new race hoax right
now I'm going to call it a hoax not
because the details didn't happen
because they probably did or something
close to it but we're still in the fog
of War we don't know exactly what
happened some of it might change but
here's the story there was a 16 year old
kid
um who went to the home of some 80 plus
year old guy in Kansas City
the kid was at the wrong house it is
reported he was trying to pick up his
brother or something but he knocked on
the wrong door
or the doorbell or something and there
was an old man there who believed that
the young man was up to no good
and started shooting
and apparently he'll survive but he did
get a shot in the head and at least one
other place
but he looks like he'll survive as a
that's the most recent news now there's
no there's no indication that
this kid was doing anything
illegal however
the kid opened the door
there are a lot of details we're going
to find out
that I think are going to add some let's
say Nuance to the story that was not
originally there now do you think this
will cause a whole bunch of people to
protest
of course it will yeah there'll be a big
protest against the fact that they say
that it was a white man who killed the
black kid and it must be racism
because the black kid was doing nothing
wrong
according to the way the story is being
presented and therefore if somebody shot
him
that was
racism by definition
now here's a here's the part we don't
know
if he thought he was at the right house
it might be a house that he was so
familiar with where he was picking up
his son picking up his brother it might
be a house that has a very casual let
yourself in kind of a situation
now
that's a thing right if any of you have
teens and does anybody have teens
have you ever had the experience of a
stranger walking into your house like
they owned it
because it's a teenager who knows your
kid and just they just walk in the door
because they probably called ahead and
the kids said oh yeah just come on in
you know on the cell phone and suddenly
you're sitting in the kitchen of your
own house and two strangers will walk in
and not even say hi to you and just walk
past you have you ever had that happen
I asked
it's pretty common it's like oh well I
hope somebody in the house knows these
two I hope somebody here knows them
um
so I'm just speculating but there are
lots of things that could have happened
here it's possible that it was one of
those houses where they knew the
residents so well
they're just walking in the front door
wasn't going to be a problem
because I mean their own family walks in
the front door so the fact that the door
opens is probably not as scary by itself
and then you look up and you see
somebody you know really well and go hey
you here to pick up your brother he's in
the other room
but imagine if you were not expecting
somebody and you didn't know him and it
was the wrong house and suddenly
somebody's coming into your house
what is the law in that situation I
don't even know
that would clearly be a case of you know
mistaken intention I guess yeah I would
vary by state I don't even know if a
comma if a crime was committed do you
now the the old man is he's out on bail
but I don't know if it was a crime would
he would the old man have to feel
threatened because he said he was afraid
for his life
the old man said he was afraid for his
life
now Ben Shapiro had interesting context
to put on this he was
he was pointing out that you know the
Biden will make a big deal of it and it
will be the it'll be the new race story
to demonize the right Etc
and
uh he pointed down to that what's not
mentioned in all of this is some of the
statistical realities
such as I think I tweeted him but didn't
write him down
um oh here it is this is according to
Ben Shapiro he was tweeting about this
story today
he says from the Bureau of Justice
statistics there were in 2019
562 000 violent interracial meaning
black and white people involved
incidents 84 percent of them were black
on white
so there were 473
000 instances of black people attacking
white people in 2019. 473
000 attacks by black people and white
people
but this is but we'll talk about this
one
this one because this is the important
one
which appears to be based entirely on an
accident
and a very old person whose judgment
maybe was not on point
um now let me ask you this question this
is the most dangerous question in
America and you can get canceled for
asking this question I'm already
canceled so I can ask it
how about that here's something I can
say that you can't say you ready watch
what it's like to have free speech
this is fun
the rest of you you can't say this
if you knew that there were 473 attacks
by black people against whites and a
black teenager entered your home and you
didn't know him
is it reasonable to be afraid for your
safety
is it reasonable to be afraid
if there were 473
000 attacks of black people on white
people in 2019.
is that enough to say
oh well this could be a problem
or or you might ask the question a
different way again I'm the only one who
can say this because I'm already
canceled
what percentage of all the times a black
male youth entered somebody's home
without permission
was it just an accident
of all the times ever
that a young black man
entered a home not invited you know
opened the door or got it in any other
way
how many of those times was just an
accident and it was an innocent
situation
I don't know if I had to guess probably
kind of rare
kind of kind of rare I guess
so here's a 80 plus year old man whose
only defense is himself
do you think the police were there like
just ready ready to pounce no no it was
an old man
who only had himself to protect himself
and a gun
and he saw the situation and he
interpreted it as danger to him was he
wrong
was he wrong from his statistical sense
from a common sense self-defense
perspective was he wrong to assume that
he was in danger physically
he was not
he was not wrong to play the odds
it is however in our modern world
considered racist
if any part of the decision was
influenced by the race of the person who
got shot
it is however also common sense
so what do you do when common sense and
your own legitimate need for safety
is in direct conflict with being not a
racist
well this old man decided to be safe
and make sure he was safe
and he took a risk which we wish he had
not so this is tragic anyway you look at
it certainly certainly not blaming the
kid I want to make this very clear
I'm not putting any blame on the kid
there's nothing in the story that would
suggest the kid had anything bad
intentions or anything else
but
this looks like just a mistake and the
mistake was caused by massive uh
Violence by black people against white
people that is so common that all white
people understand it and feel it
how many black people are afraid when
they walk into a crowd of white people
in the United States ever ever
if if one black let's keep it to let's
not say black people because it's almost
always male it's almost always youngish
right so it's not elderly people it's
not little children it's mostly not
women mostly
but if a
let's say a 19 year old black male
accidentally wandered into a group of
white people anywhere
would they feel afraid in America
I don't think so I think it'd be a
pretty safe place to be unless somebody
started trouble for some reason
but do you feel it the other way if you
were a white person and you wandered
into let's say a white teenager and you
wandered it to a large group of young
black men
would you feel safe no matter where you
were unless it was church I mean I'd
feel safe in church I'd feel I'd feel
safe on a you know historically black
college
right so obviously you have to call your
shots but if it was a you know just a
random occurrence somewhere
if you were on the street when the
Chicago uh
I think mostly or all black groups of of
kids were rioting and stuff if you were
a white guy and you just wandered into
that would you feel safe
of course not
yeah no let's not be stupid
your physical safety is at Great risk if
you are not racist
if you act a little bit racist you might
be able to protect yourself from dying
so this guy was acting a little bit
racist or you could say a lot you might
even say a lot because I do think his
decision was based on the color
don't you
what do you think
I would say yes
I think that I think it was based on the
color
a little bit
you don't think oh you don't think a
little bit come on
come on you don't think a little bit he
was influenced by the color
you don't think it made any difference
to him that you know pretty much
everybody knows in their gut that this
is true that 473
000 times black people did violence to
white people in one year
you don't think that that statistical
obvious truth that every white person
knows you don't think that anything to
do with this decision
all right well I guess we're gonna have
to agree to disagree on this of course
it did of course it is but is that his
fault
was that the old man's fault
that he was influenced by the crime
statistics
well I'll tell you what if he had been
applying for a job
and was rejected because he was black
that would be very very bad and I
wouldn't wouldn't be in favor of that in
any way
you have to judge people as individuals
there's no way around that that's the
only way Society works
but in the context of protecting your
life
was he allowed to use race in his
decision yes or no
he was trying to protect his life
yeah absolutely he is absolutely allowed
to use race in that decision in my
opinion
because his life is at stake
now
doing that
caused the the tragedy of this young
black man who as far as we know was
causing no trouble at all who who is the
bastard in the story
who is the guilty party or parties in
the story
well I would say
teachers unions how about teachers
unions how about every black leader
who's failed because whatever they're
doing isn't working
how about all of the people who
committed
473 000 violent crimes do you think they
had anything to do with the fact that
one of their own guys shot of course it
was
the problem is not that the old man
played the statistics
as it turns out wasn't the right
decision
but he played the odds
and that's not his fault
the decision is his fault it's
completely his fault but understanding
that there is a real risk it's not an
imaginary risk there's a real risk you
just didn't have all the details so it's
a tragedy
all right
how many of you could have said that out
loud
see I I do think that something has
changed
well in front of your employer I don't
know
um
I think something has changed
I think there's a little bit extra
willingness
to at least look at the whole field
right we've only been allowed to look at
one little thing because if you don't
you're a racist but once you allow that
everybody's a racist and there's just no
way around it there's no way around it
just to embrace it then you can talk
honestly and then maybe you could find
some solutions maybe something useful to
come in all right let's talk about
something else
uh Brian romelli who continues to
fascinate me with his tweets about AI
because he's very much on top of it and
he's he's commercializing we're at least
making useful the number of AI features
but here's what he did this just blows
my mind the the number of stories that
are going to blow your mind every day
uh he tweets I'm excited to announce I
built a data set of every U.S patent
ever filed and I'm in the process of
testing the blah blah blah AI system to
advise on new patent ideas
it is very very early blah blah blah but
you can see what could happen all right
believe it or not
he's trying to train AI to make its own
inventions based on what inventions have
already been made
because most inventors are some kind of
combination of ideas from other ideas
is that going to work
it might
I don't know how often it would be a bad
idea invention and how often it'd be
good
but it feels like
I don't know Maybe
you know could AI get to the point where
it doesn't need to do a physical
demonstration than an idea works could
it just imagine the idea or it's all
right so if you were to put this
material with this material given the
qualities of these two materials the
probable outcome would be X does AI even
need to do the experiment
or if it says it would work does the
patent office say well AI says the Lord
so we'll grant that patent man there are
a lot of questions to be answered
a lot of questions but the best part
about it in my opinion is how many of
you have ever tried to file a patent
how many of you in in this audience
probably quite a few
all right you see the s's coming in on
the locals platform a lot of yeses a lot
of Engineers and lawyers and wow that's
a lot of yeses so a lot of you have
tried to file a patent what's the
hardest part about filing the patent
besides actually writing it what's the
hardest part
the way it is now no the hardest part is
finding out if it's already patented
the patent search because there's never
been a good patent search because it's
largely you'd have to know a little bit
about what people called things you know
what words in terms of Art and you know
did it get filed in the right place and
you you really can't
so do you know what your lawyer tells
you if you say I'd like you to do a
search to see if this is already
patented do you know what the lawyer
says well I could do a search
but it won't tell you if it's already
patented
what isn't that the whole point of the
search
yeah I mean I can search I can use all
the tools we can Google it we can do
everything we can but when I'm done
you'll have no idea whether it's already
patented
and I said what we have the database
right everything's in text titles
are you telling me there's actually no
way
to successfully search the database and
the lawyer will say nope not even close
so I say well then what do people do
you know the answer that if you can't be
sure
how do you find out
you actually try to get the patent and
then you wait for people to challenge it
can you believe that that's the actual
process you get the patent
and then if you ever try to use it
somebody also complained
and then then you know
and then maybe you end up in court to
decide if that claim actually does cover
your claim let me give you an example so
years ago
uh before
this was common and obvious
I tried to patent the idea that if you
wrote on your calendar you know your
personal digital calendar anything you
were planning to do
that that information could be sent to
some you know secret uh secure place and
that people who provided Services
relevant to that thing would be able to
promote them on right on the calendar
so let's say you you put on your
calendar a week from now shop for a new
car
when you were ready to actually shop you
know on the day you would click on the
link that says shop for a new car and it
would show you all the offers
from people who want to sell you a car
now the people want to sell you the car
don't know who you are
they only know that the system said send
an advertisement to this you know
Anonymous place and we'll make sure it
gets to the person who's looking for a
car so that the seller doesn't know who
the buyer is but they can be paired
and so I thought
well we'll search to see if anybody
thought of that
and we did and we could find nothing
and then when it went into the patent
the patent office found a pattern that
in my opinion had nothing to do with my
patent nothing
it was basically a generic patent that
was if something's written I'm making
this up but it was this generic it was
like if something is written down it can
be used in another way or so you know on
a calendar
I'm making that up but it was so generic
obviously very obviously did not
consider the application that I was
talking about now that's how that's how
patents work in the past I think now too
so you really can't even search for a
patent
now would AI have found that obscure one
that the patent office somehow found
that that my lawyer couldn't find
I don't know but it's better than humans
you know I've got a feeling that
uh yeah the reviewer is the most random
factor in the process right if you get a
reviewer who happens to think something
connects to your patent
urine worse off than if you get a patent
inspector or whatever they are who
just doesn't know of that other patent
or didn't have a search for it or
couldn't find it it's pretty random yeah
the whole the whole patent thing is
broken
all right Jordan Peterson had a problem
with his AI I think it was chat GPT yeah
he was asking it to help it come up with
some sources for some work and he
noticed that one of the sources was very
detailed you know name of the source and
the dates and the author and all that
and it wasn't real
it was fake
so you've heard this problem before that
the AI dreams or it or it will tell you
something that's untrue
but it's not clear if the AI was
I don't know if this is the right word
did the AI know it was untrue and give
it to you anyway or can it not tell the
difference
I feel like you can't tell the
difference
how big of a problem is that we're going
to hand over all of our data processing
and research to Ai and apparently
it doesn't it doesn't seem to be
bothered by the truth
it doesn't seem to do that now when you
look at how AI became smart and I'm
still very confused about this I'm
hoping somebody can
you know get me from uh a one out of ten
and understanding up to a you know maybe
a five
because a scale of one to ten I feel
like I'm about a one in understanding
how AI could possibly be intelligent
like how do you how do people who are
less intelligent program something to be
more intelligent than they are well
obviously we did it with computers for
stuff like math and playing chess but
this is a whole different level
so
allegedly these these massive language
models just figure out what is the word
that comes after the words that are
already there
how in the world does that work
like I get it
but is that all intelligence is
what if our own intelligence human
intelligence and this is the thing I've
been warning you about that we'll find
out that we're not intelligent in the
process of building a machine that we
think is intelligent we're going to
learn that we never were
it was always an illusion
have you noticed that when other people
who are not you
read the news
when they read the news they're looking
at a bunch of words
and then they conclude something that's
completely different than what you
concluded from the same words
if you notice that
Apparently that is how people think they
look at words and then based on
just words they form an opinion
not Reason Not logic
words
and the pattern in the words
so in other words even if you asked AI
is is a scientific thing true or false
its answer might be right but it
wouldn't be based on whether the science
was true or false it would be based on
the words that it noticed
you know around the topic in some cases
am I just quote some Source but if it
was trying to make the decision on its
own without using a source it would make
it by the pattern of words
the pattern of words
how in the world does that tell you if a
scientific thing is true or false the
pattern of human words
so there's a really big question I have
about how smart you could ever be if
you're limited to the pattern of human
words
that has to keep you stupid
and it has to make you a liar it has to
make you wrong without knowing it and
I'm going to make another Wild
uh prediction you ready for this
I think
the AI will be susceptible to cognitive
dissonance
and confirmation bias
at least cognitive dissonance
I believe that if you ask AI why it did
something sketchy like suppose I don't
know if this happened but suppose Jordan
Peterson said to AI hey that source is
fake why did you give me a fake source
what would a human say in that situation
a human who is also designed to be a a
word thinking kind of a entity what
would a human do if you call layout for
cognitive dissonance no it never says
I'm sorry are you kidding
I can't even tell if that was a joke no
no human says they're sorry
cognitive distance means they think
they're right they don't apologize for
thinking they're right
no they tell you that you're the one
who's wrong and they Double Down
they might even come with a reason that
they're really right that will sound
ridiculous
I think
AI is going to do the same thing
because if AI is built on language large
language pattern recognition it's going
to pick up all of our worst habits
and that would be the worst of our worst
is cognitive dissonance so I think it's
going to pick up the habit
I don't know we'll see that's my
prediction so I'm not I don't know if
anybody's predicted it so I'm going to
go out on a limb and I'm going to say
the AI will experience cognitive
dissonance if if it's thinking style
this is the big if if his thinking style
is really
primarily just looking at word patterns
I think you end up with cognitive
dissonance
but we'll see
um
I remember I told you that uh the one
thing that would probably slow down AI
is lawyers
and copyrights and stuff like that well
here it comes so apparently one of the
sources for the large language model is
uh Reddit
so the AIS have been reading all the
Reddit comments and traffic and using
that to build their intelligence do you
know what Reddit says
um if you're going to use our content
you're going to have to pay for it
oh oh well here it comes
so there's going to be a battle of
Royale
between lawyers and AI
on one hand AI will be taking all the
business away from lawyers on the other
hand lawyers will find a way to sue AI
for stealing copyrights and lawyers will
move from doing Simple contracts for
humans which now the AI can do and the
lawyers will do nothing but Sue AI
yeah that's my next prediction
the job of a lawyer will be suing AI
on behalf of humans why well I need a
lawyer I need a lawyer to sue AI for me
because AI defamed me right being AI
says that I'm an alleged white
nationalist there's literally no
evidence that would even suggest
anything of that kind nothing
nothing and they put that there and
defamed to me is that liable or
defamation I always confuse them but
don't I need a lawyer
don't I need a lawyer to sue Binga AI I
think so so that's my next prediction is
that lawyers will stop doing little
human contracts AI will do that but the
lawyers will move into a direct fight
with AI and that the lawyers will be the
ones who are the
the controlling factors on AI and
eventually it'll all be ruined because
the lawyers will make it useless you
won't be able to do anything
uh
what about NASA
somebody asked me to debunk something
about NASA I don't know that story all
right Elon Musk there's more of the Elon
Musk conversation with Tucker Carlson
yeah one of the things Elon Musk brought
up which
I think about a lot
so historically civilizations last about
250 years did you know that
like a like a big Power in the past you
know there'd be big some big city and
it'd be teeming you know Mesopotamia or
wherever it is and about 250 years later
Rome you know all the big civilizations
all the empires Empires yes let's say
Empires instead of civilizations thank
you Empires is the right word
so
that would suggest that America has a
timer on it
and I'm not going to Discount that but
there's no reason given
there there's not one or a small package
of reason why every civilization or
every Empire ends uh in around 250 years
and I would like to uh add some optimism
to this by saying nothing's ever been
like this
no time in history was everybody
connected by the internet
the internet is probably what keeps an
Empire from you know crumpling for let's
say ridiculous reasons it would seem to
me that any Empire would be vulnerable
to all matter of you know risks
so sooner or later and maybe it takes
about 250 years something gets you so
it's either smallpox or floods or meteor
hits you or something
but if you look at let's just say the
history of natural disasters
the our ability to withstand you know
hurricanes and earthquakes and all
matter of natural disasters is really
really good
including and up to maybe climate change
you know there you could disagree
whether that's at risk or not but if it
is a risk we seem to be on our way to
addressing it before becoming extinct
yeah so I don't think there's
necessarily one obvious reason why any
Empire would only last 250 years and I
think that the fact that we're a global
civilization
gives you all kinds of protection
against all kinds of things
right
so
take America it's we're fairly it's
unlikely because of nuclear weapons that
we would be attacked on the ground and
somebody would you know send in an army
and just take over on the ground that's
never happened before
was there any other Empire that could
not be conquered by a ground force
you know people literally people
standing on the ground
nope but I think we are I think America
is unconquerable by a ground force
so that's different right what about
disease
could disease wipe out an Empire yes
but we tend to be pretty good
at
getting rid of diseases and management
what about financial upheavals well we
got plenty of those and there's plenty
to worry about but we tend to be able to
adjust them a little bit you know
because of the international connections
and we have more experts and we're just
more flexible about everything now
so I would like to push back on the
Empire's
only lasting 250 years I think that in
our connected world
our ability to solve problems is just
through the roof like we can solve
problems we're really really really
really really good at solving problems
but was Rome
you know where the were the Moguls in
the Mogul Empire or whatever Mongol not
Mogul that would be skiing
it confused skiing with my
Mongols
all right so
musk also said that we got this big
problem with all this commercial real
estate meaning that banks have loans to
companies that own big buildings that
are now being empty because of some some
because of crime
and some because of remote work
and I guess San Francisco is 40 percent
unoccupied commercial real estate
40 percent
how in the world does San Francisco
survive that and how did the banks
survive it
so
mosque scared the hell out of me with
the banking stuff
he said that it's not obvious how the
commercial real estate thing is going to
turn out but it all looks bad interest
rates are high which means we might have
a double risk of mortgage real estate
just your your house
at the same time there's a commercial
real estate crisis which would be the
double crisis of all times and musk
thinks that if banks marked to Market
which means actually put on their books
the actual value of what they have they
would all be negative
on average not all not every bank but
the banks on average would be negative
already
now that alone
doesn't mean there's a problem because
banks are sort of an artificial
construct so being worth negative money
in the short run is not the biggest
problem in the world
in the long run it might be
but
uh
can you see any other use
for these commercial real estate I saw I
saw smart people say oh that commercial
real estate will be turned into
residential
and then that's fine
to which I say no the reason that the
commercial real estate is not filled is
because the city is too dangerous and
terrible
that's not going to change the city is
still dangerous and terrible who's who
wants to live there who wants to live in
the exact place that the company moved
out of because of crime
and if you move the homeless in there
then that's the end of the real estate
value as well
I don't know there might be some
solution for these but I don't know what
it is
all right
I want to hear my most out of the box
idea
I know you do
have you ever heard of a heat chimney
a heat chimney would be if you imagine
uh just a big chimney
but you make it like really high like
the the size of a skyscraper
and then you you take advantage of the
fact that there's a higher temperature
on the ground always than there is way
up in the air where the top of the
building is
then you open the grounds you open the
doors at the bottom
and then you open the let's say whatever
is the
there's probably a doorway on this on
the roof you open the roof you open all
the doors inside
and you open the ground floor
and the air will just shoot up there now
it has to go around a lot of Corners so
maybe you knock out some walls or you
know you make make more of a straight
shot
you would create massive powerful
airflow
and then you hook some
hook some what do you call it turbine
turbines to it or generators and you
could generate electricity
so you could actually turn empty
skyscrapers into energy generation
you want another one
here's another one
indoor gardens
turn all of the skyscrapers into indoor
gardens
now I don't know if they would make
enough money but they might
because it probably doesn't make as much
money as just paying rent for humans but
yeah so I don't know if the economics of
that would work
but I would say indoor gardens and heat
heat chimneys to generate electricity
there might be some other Innovative
uses for them
anyway we might I think we'll work it
out eventually but it's going to be it's
going to be dicing this one's going to
be tough yeah the banking problem is
currently the one I worry about the most
the commercial real estate specifically
that could be a problem
all right see what else is going on
according to Erasmus and pole this is
usually of registered voters or likely
voters
65 percent of those polled now suspect
that the feds provoked the riot on
January 6.
laughs so
do you wonder what the uh what the
influence level of Tucker Carlson is
this is amazing
65 percent of the country believes that
the feds provoked January 6.
do you think those January 6 hearings
went just the way the the Democrats
hoped
did cernovich say he just he doesn't
believe Kent State now
I'm with him I'm totally on board yeah
we should not believe any story from our
past you shouldn't believe any of it
because everything is obviously so easy
to fake now but how much was faked in
the past
I think it's perfectly reasonable to
doubt some of the most
um confirmed well-reported stories of
the past I think it would be perfectly
fine to doubt them
um
so I guess that gives the win to Tucker
Carlson
so I'm going to do a little test here
some of you on YouTube may never have
experienced this before but
I say that my live stream viewers are
the smartest
smartest viewers anywhere so watch this
without any without any priming
um
if you know this 65 percent
I think the feds were provoked the
January 6 Riot uh what percentage do you
guess and I'll let you be within one
percent
let's see if you can get it within one
percent what percentage uh don't believe
it is likely the riot was provoked by
government agents don't believe it was
oh
what
how do you do this
26 percent
I don't know how you do it
now if you're new here are you is there
anybody new here
who is oppressed how many people could
guess that right with no information
whatsoever
I hope you're impressed smartest crowd
in the entire internet
well Trump is trying to find ways to go
after DeSantis but there aren't that
many good ways so uh he's talking about
DeSantis you know blowing it with Disney
so you know DeSantis is putting pressure
on Disney because of you know trans woke
stuff and and Disney's fighting back by
having the largest lgbtq gathering the
largest lgbtq gathering will be in
Disney in Florida
but Trump was saying you said this quote
Disney's next move will be the
announcement that no more money will be
invested in Florida
because of the governor do you think
that'll happen
do you think Disney will say we can't
invest in this state anymore I don't
think so I think they're too I think
they're too uh
too locked into Florida
I think Disney will do whatever makes
sense for Disney to make money that's
not going to be that will not include
leaving Florida
so that's not going to happen
but that's all uh Petty's stupid fight
the other thing uh Elon Musk said about
aliens
uh I loved his answer he has such clean
simple answers that leave you nothing to
debate
must said that he might know more than
anybody
about
the likelihood of aliens because he's
deeply involved in space and as he says
he knows a lot about space
and according to him
he said there's no evidence
of any aliens
no evidence
so what do you think of all those UFO uh
videos
do you think that Elon Musk thinks the
videos are all fake or misleading
you must if he says there's no evidence
I'm sure that he also believes that the
spaceships are not real now I believe
that those are all fake
not necessarily faked intentionally but
there's some you know artifact or
there's some explanation or something
you know or people are making it up or
it's a mass hysteria something but I
don't think it's any aliens I don't
think there are any UFOs they're UFOs
but I don't think they're alien chips
uh Scott just dumped on half of you
what do you mean
I didn't dug down anybody
all right
what else
uh
yeah that looks like about it let me let
me just see if I missed anything quickly
no it turns out that I was very thorough
today
is there anything that I should have
mentioned that I didn't otherwise it
looks like
so far it's the best live stream you've
ever seen in your life
so far
there was a sip today YouTube had a
technical problem so you missed it but
I'm going to give you a special closing
sip
for this is just be for YouTube and then
I'm gonna talk to the locals people
privately
for a little bit
so YouTubers if you missed the
simultaneous sip this is for you
those on locals they get a double sip
because they're special
go
ah
yeah
yeah that's what I'm talking about
all right
be good be good all right thanks YouTube
for joining especially with the
technical problems and I will talk to
you
tomorrow
