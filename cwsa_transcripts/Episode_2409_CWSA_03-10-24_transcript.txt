on 5G today because my internet is down
yet
again should be able to get it fixed
later today I've got an appointment with
my internet
provider I'm hoping it's nothing
personal but we're coming in a little
early this is the pre-show I normally do
this just for the local subscribers but
today we're all together using the
rumble
studio and I'm seeing all the locals
comments all right I'll give you an idea
what the delay is so I'm seeing
Flagstaff
greetings from
Barry I'll tell you the next comment I
get will be
oh oh I was behind um I'm seeing uh Owen
good
morning happy daylight savings
time all right so far I am see seeing uh
only comments from locals it looks like
you've been
prioritized
audio there there's always at least one
person saying where's your
audio all right I'm assuming you could
hear me fine
right most of you let me grab my notes
get serious
I sure wish these
comments would roll on their
own good audio that's what I
thought and I already lost
5G the the 5G already just went out so
almost there's very little chance we're
going to get through
this because one of the things I found
is that when my regular um internet goes
out my 5G almost always goes out at the
same
time it's never useful as a backup
completely yeah damn it so what kind of
picture are you seeing uh I'm
transmitting at low fidelity
go to Starbucks yeah that's not going to
happen X doesn't load the previous
comments when you load the page
H yep yep the comment we will not allow
today there are two comments that are
not allowed today one will M will
Michelle Obama run for president
no and two I should get
starlink I know you just don't need to
say
it yeah I'm well aware of the
options oh I just realized that when I
see the comments on the rumble Studio I
don't see your photos
so I don't see any memes I'm going to
try
something which I haven't tried before
to see if I can join the show as a guest
see your
comments oh this might work all right
we're going to see if this uh crashes
the whole system we'll go live with the
show at the top of the hour this is the
pre-show if anybody's coming in from one
of the platforms besides
locals uh and uh this is what the locals
people
generally get all right let's see what
happens if I have
two so I'll be signed on to locals twice
if this
works I think it's not going to work but
we'll
see oh this could be interesting it's
probably going to crash the rumble
Studio it's
trying I don't have enough of an
internet connection to pull this
off
um right now we're coming to you through
the rumble studio so I don't have an
option of segmenting who's in here
you're either all in or nobody's
in um it's a problem with my internet
provider they're coming out this
afternoon yeah the internet provider
found the problem on their own and they
alerted me do it so they coming out to
fix it it's unstable on the internet
side turns out there might not be
anything wrong with my equipment after
all is everybody as sleepy as I
am you have the best of your life last
night now that's the good news I like to
hear whoa something's
happening well I just started seeing
your comments on my separate
device that's interesting but it's also
it's not showing me the
images oh it's showing me
myself I appear to be live on two
platforms
forms which one of me do you
see do you have do you have two
uh so let me tell you what I'm seeing
we'll go live in two minutes two minutes
we'll go live
um I'm seeing myself on two different
systems so uh tell me which camera oh my
goodness okay I thought I was watching
uh watching myself in the other feed but
I'm actually seeing myself
delayed there we
go all right so it looks like I'm see oh
there I'm seeing
images oh look at that so there might be
a work around here that I can I can see
your images this
way all right
we may have solved the problem
here may have solved the problem because
I can see the uh locals comment
separately now on a separate device but
uh I'm working on
LTE I don't even have 5G so I have no
idea how long this feed is going to stay
up probably not
long all
right so
well here we go it's
[Music]
[Music]
time good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adamson
it's the best thing that ever happened
to you and if you'd like to uh enjoy
this experience at levels that nobody
can even understand oh I'm going to have
to turn off this
monitor I'm watching two monitors and
I'm delayed on one do you know how hard
it is to talk when you're watching
yourself do something that you're not
actually doing I'm talking and I'm
watching myself in the other monitor
doing the the paper tap
thing anyway that's not ideal but if
you'd like to take your experience up
the levels that nobody can even
understand all you need for that is a
CER m a glass of tanker chelse St Stein
juger flask a anyai and fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
of the dope means of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go pretty good pretty
good so how many of you are uh exhausted
from losing that hour of sleep last
night I am I am totally
exhausted yep that didn't work out at
all for me so we'll see if we can limp
through this um the update on my
internet connection is the internet
providers coming out this afternoon they
detected a problem in their Network so
it might not be on my
end um if you're reading Dilbert reborn
or if you're a subscriber either on the
locals platform Scott adams. locals.com
or on the export
profile
um then uh you would know that uh
Dilbert's company's having trouble
because China stole their source
code I don't want to give away too much
but when China stole the source code of
Dilbert's company it didn't go well for
China yeah that's a little
preview um you may have noticed I lost
my blue check mark on
X uh because I I think I knew this but I
forgot got I changed my profile picture
and they they take your they take your
uh blue check
away now it's supposedly supposed to
come back after they verify you or
something but it's been days I don't
know if it's coming back or not I'm not
even sure if I'm monetized
anymore that it's like the worst thing
they they should if I could make one
suggestion before you are allowed to
change your profile before then it
should to tell you you're can lose your
check mark not after no not
after cuz I wouldn't have changed it if
I know if I know I'd lose my check mark
I don't even know if it's coming
back well did you know that uh you know
Biden made a bunch of money available to
move American chip production over to
the USA but that's not working out at
all guess why turns out nobody wants to
manufacture
chips when you need a skill build
Workforce and you also have Dei
requirements people are deciding oh we
can't do this in America because we
can't do those two things we we can't
get enough skilled employees if we also
have to serve a different master of you
know hting getting some requirements for
uh Dei so there are companies that could
be building American chip production in
America that uh are looking for other
countries do so we have people who are
perfectly willing and able to build chip
Manufacturing in America and we burden
them with such ridiculous requirements
that they're like no thanks I think
we'll go to a third world country we'll
be
safer well there's a brand new building
material that uh can warm you when it's
cold and make you cooler when it's
warm reminds me of that old thermos joke
you know you put hot water in your
thermos and it stays hot you put cold
water in your thermos and it stays cold
how does it know it's an old joke I
don't know who said it first but
apparently there's a
material that knows how to absorb when
it wants to make the building warmer and
it knows how to automatically reflect
when it needs to keep it cooler and it's
Auto it's not not automated it's just
built into the material so you don't
have to you have any electron or
anything it just does it so that's
pretty cool something coming out of
Chinese research in in Wuhan
what it's from the Wuhan University of
Technology well nothing bad has ever
come out a Wuhan so I think we're fine
about
that all right uh there's a new
study that I'm going to tell you in
advance before I tell you the content it
is the most accurate credible completely
reliable study I've ever seen in my
life you know how to interpret that
right it agrees with my it agrees with
what I wanted to hear and that's what I
call science and the study says that uh
quote another unexpected benefit from
consuming uh
cannabis uh especially when it's
recreational is that
participants who only use cannabis
recreationally has sign iFly lower risk
of subjective cognitive
decline as much
as 96% less
risk compared to
non-users did you hear the 96
part 96% less risk of of being impaired
if you smoke
marijuana
regularly
so this is all part of my plan to run
for president when I'm 90 years old
because let me tell
you I haven't done any double blind
Placebo controlled randomized controlled
trials but I feel like I'm getting
smarter every
day yeah I feel like that's
happening all right um there's an update
on uh McConnell's Mitch McConnell's
sister-in-law who tragically drove her
Tesla into a lake and drown remember we
all had some conspiracy theories about
it must have been murder somehow they
got her uh turns out we know fairly
substantially uh you with credibility
that it wasn't murder it was uh an
accident but worse than you imagined
because apparently she was able to make
a cell phone call from her submerged
car now if that's the only thing you
know about this story it's about as
horrible as anything I can even imagine
so I guess they didn't have divers when
the emergency crews got there they
couldn't get around she couldn't open
the door they didn't have anything that
would tow her
around and so I guess it was one woman
who dove in and tried to do something
but that was
impossible so but the I don't want to
call it good news it's definitely not
good news but uh it's news that it was
just an accident one of the worst ones
I've ever heard in my life
honestly so she drove her car into a
lake well speaking of
Laken uh lakan
rally
um that she's still in the news because
you know she was tragically murdered by
an undocumented some say illegal
immigrant and the issue is that Biden
had referred to the killer as illegal
but had to walk it back because all the
Democrats said you can't call that
murderer illegal you must say
undocumented and you
know personal point of
privilege I'd like to make the news more
about me because that's what is missing
a lot of the news would be stories that
don't involve me and I feel that's just
WR wrong so I'd like to make this about
me somehow and I'd like say that if I
ever get murdered by somebody who came
from another
country I hope they're undocumented
because I feel that wouldn't hurt as
much as an
illegal am I wrong about that if you get
murdered by an undocumented person I
don't think it hurts as much so that's
what I'm hoping
for setting my sight's
low well as uh bology sason was pointing
out uh uh that the New York Times
bestseller list did you know that's
always been
fake how many of you were aware of that
that the New York Times best list is not
based on who sells the most books did
you know that it's
editorial they get to decide what's on
the list and what's not I first learned
that when I had the number one
bestselling book in the
country but not according to the New
York Times bestselling list
now keep in mind that if you're an
author and you're working with a big
publisher they have access to the actual
sales reports they know what book is
number one the Publishers do and then
they look at the New York Times it's
different now as a publisher no I'm
sorry as a as an author I've known that
for 25 years something like that and
that was one of my first wakeup calls
that nothing is real just nothing is
real
real if the New York Times bestseller
list is not really based on who's
selling the most books do you think the
news is
real do you think anything in that
newspaper is
real well what could be easier than just
saying who sold the most
books it doesn't get much easier than
that it's automated every everybody's
looking at the same data you know I
think it only is from the big companies
but that tells you who sells the
most that is the book selling data is
only from the larger book sellers it's
not from every book seller but that gets
85% of
them all
right
um but although the New York Times
bestseller
list is
fake one thing we can feel good about
and I think you'd all join me in this is
at least the climate models are
real yeah just when you're feeling like
oh is everything made up and fake at
least those climate models are
completely real yeah everything else is
fake moving
on uh there's a Oscar nominated film
called the holdovers that I never heard
of because I don't watch movies anymore
because they're all garbage is uh
apparently the the writer of the script
is accused of
plagiarism so the claim is that there
was some script that never got made into
a movie that a lot of people saw and the
person wrote this movie saw it and they
know there's some information that they
know the writer saw it and so it's an
Oscar nominated film but it might be
plagiarized that's the claim
wow if you can't trust the
Oscars who can you
trust so I guess I can't trust the New
York Times best seller list and I can't
really trust that the Oscar nominated
film is not plagiarized
but at least climate models are real I
mean we we still have that we still have
that people we still have
that all
right Trump continues to be the
president who swears better than any
president has ever sweared at least in
public as his rally he said and I quote
everything Joe Biden touches turns to
everything now uh here's a lesson in
cursing cursing is generally a bad idea
and it's especially bad when women do
it now you're going to say to me what
that's kind of
sexist I'm just saying that when women
curse there's a substantial number of
men who Go
pass now I'm not one of them I don't
mind when women curse at all but it's a
bad play if if you're if you're
single there's a pretty substantial
percentage of men who have a problem
with it uh I don't know what the
percentage is might be 20% something
like that but I don't I don't think it
works the same for men I don't think
women are judging men the same way I
could be wrong but uh Trump really knows
how to use it as just the right accent
if he swore more than he does it would
be too much and it would just be gross
if he never swore we wouldn't get this
cool story he swears exactly the right
amount and exactly the right way like
because it turns into a quotable you
know moment and here I am talking about
it so persuasion
wise uh Trump is on target with
that there there will be more stories
about
Trump coming
up I have a theory that there's no
complic political story that ever
matters to
voters uh people like me and many of you
watching this don't you think that we're
kind of
weird like how many people could
describe the you know the steel document
and where that all went and you know was
maniford really doing anything that
could be called collusion or was he
doing his own thing you know what's up
with the law fair with Trump what's up
with B 's Ukraine stuff and Hunter
Biden I feel maybe 5% of the
country could even describe what those
things are I mean they sort of generally
know who it's good for and who it's bad
for but they don't really know and I've
got a feeling that if you don't really
understand it it doesn't change your
vote you can be aware it's out there and
if somebody asked you say oh that's
bad but I don't think it changes your
vote if it's it's complicated so I think
that's why law this one of the reasons
not the only reason I think it's one of
the reasons the laware doesn't work
against Trump is that we can't really
hold it in our heads there are too many
cases too many details I don't know is
he winning this week is he losing do I
care are there any victims I'm not
really sure so it doesn't really change
my vote
likewise all the hunter Biden Ukraine
Chinese lost diamonds
stuff it all sounds pretty bad but you
know I follow this stuff every day or
try to and I'm not as sure I could do a
great job of explaining it all you know
I could get the Highlights lost diamonds
selling influence but I'm not sure I can
get you know most of the Nuance of it
so um so that's going to be my my theme
is that uh just keep in mind that the
more complexity to a story the less
compelling it is no matter how bad it is
let me say that again because that's an
important point no matter how bad the
story should be because of what we know
about it it just doesn't affect people
because they can't handle that level of
complexity enough to make it op make it
an operating part of their
decision-making so let's talk about Tik
Tock as you know there was a bipartisan
50 to zero vote to ban and a committee
now the committee doesn't get to
decide um the whole Congress gets to
decide and you might say to yourself
wait a minute if it's
bipartisan and it's 50
people and it's 50 to
zero that that's very predictive that
it's going to get banned wouldn't you
say in a normal World in a normal world
that would be very predictive
in our world not so much so surprisingly
Trump who used to be in favor of the ban
um when he was president and even tried
to get it banned is now in favor of it
staying
unbanned and V is also he's said this
before but he uses it to use it during
his campaign and uh he says free speech
um you know let it
stand
and Rand Paul Rand Paul also saides keep
Tick Tock kind of surprised some of you
probably did any of those names surprise
you you thought
what I thought that'd be for the band
but no Rand says freedom of speech and
Thomas Massie also now what are those
four people have in common besides being
Republicans what do they all have in
common well they're some of the smartest
people in
politics right I mean that that the
thing that jumps out is like oh that's a
little list of the smartest people in
politics right there and they're all on
the same side so they're on the S side
of keeping it but here's the interesting
thing when they talk about it they talk
about it like they don't understand the
topic now how do you reconcile that when
I say they don't understand the topic
they'll say things like um first
Amendment your freedom of speech but
they have to know that doesn't apply to
a Chinese propaganda company of course
they do and they talk about data
security but they don't talk about the
persuasion risk which is the biggest one
by far I mean not even close so why
would so such smart people when they
talk about it talk about it in such a
weak way that's nonsensical
frankly well if you follow the news you
might know that there's a uh a
republican rich guy billionaire who
funds A lot of the Dem a lot of the
Republicans his last name is uh
yes Y and he's some billionaire who owns
a heast american guy who owns 15% of
bite dance which owns Tik
Tok so I would imagine 15% of Tik Tok
would be worth
know 100 billion 200 billion something
in that age so he's got you know and and
his money is locked up because the uh
Chinese government
disallowed uh bite dance from doing an
IPO now if they'd go in public that'd be
a liquidity event eventually and he'd be
able to sell a stake maybe not right
away but eventually but there's no
liquidity event
so he's kind of Trapped until there is
one unless he could sell it privately I
suppose
um and then the other thing we know is
that uh said billionaire met with
Trump and uh looks like they're getting
along they didn't uh they didn't get
along until recently and now they're
getting along and it looks like uh Trump
will be benefiting from some funding
from this big um fun other people who
are reportedly funded by the same um
entity
the I guess he owns The Entity
called what's it
called
uh it's called Uh Congress I'm sorry
it's called the club of growth so the
billionaire seems to be associated with
I guess it's a a pack so funds and
entity which funds a bunch of
Republicans and kellyan Conway is
reportedly uh lobbying in Congress to
keep Tik Tok and she's doing it on
behalf of the club of growth so she
would be a key advisor to Trump and is
working for the billionaire who owns
some of Tik Tok now and there's a report
that uh that club of growth also helps
fund Rand Paul um I'd heard also that V
and Thomas Massie probably get some
benefit from that funding as
well
so
so what do you think happened here what
what it looks like is that Trump wanted
to ban it and maybe U maybe some of the
others did at some point as well there's
no evidence of that but
uh they would be sort of in trouble if
they
did because they've got funding now what
makes this interesting is that the
reason that Trump might be a little bit
more interested in funding the normal is
because the lawfare from the Democrats
squeezed his cash flow so so
aggressively so it kind of put Trump in
a situation where uh money would be more
important than it normally would just
because the timing and having to come up
with huge amounts of cash for his bonds
and stuff like
that um but let me give you an idea of
what the argument looks
like so here's a
here's what Rand Paul said on the
xplatform he said if Congress bans Tik
Tok they will be acting just like the
Chinese Communist who have also banned
Tik Tock uh why not just defend the
First
Amendment Dan khaw who I'm guessing
either never got money from that
billionaire uh or doesn't plan to get
any says this in response to Rand Paul
now keep in mind you know these these
are two people who are in the Republican
world and they're not in the same team
so kensaw says to anyone defending Tik
Tock he said you're not defending the
First Amendment our first amendment
doesn't apply to the Chinese Communist
party they Ed Tik Tok to collect data
and can weaponize that into the greatest
propaganda machine against Americans we
ever ever
seen uh sorry you're getting complaints
from Jen Z but get over it and do what's
right and stop lying that legislation
doesn't ban Tik Tok it just says it
can't be controlled by our adversaries
well let me add a Nuance to that the
Chinese Communist Party says that they
won't sell
it which is probably a bluff uh if they
had no choice they might but
um there's not exactly a plan that it
would still exist if it were banned
right so that would require something
that's unlikely to happen them them
selling it to an American entity now
compare these two arguments Rand Paul
one of the smartest people in the
Congress he says it's a First Amendment
issue and then Dan creno by the way
doesn't mention the persuasion risk at
all and then Dan creno does mention the
persuasion risk so he accurately has
identified the top problem and says it's
the top problem so now kensaw is right
on he's right on the money and then he
says the First Amendment doesn't apply
to the Chinese communist party's
propaganda now which of those arguments
makes perfect sense and which one it
doesn't all right so I'm leading the
witness here but K Shaw is
100% And Rand Paul got a zero you get a
zero on an easy question so how do you
explain somebody getting a zero like
you're just getting everything wrong and
so obviously wrong on an easy question
when you're one of the Smart
Ones
so as I as I was posting the other day
something is a
miss something is a miss so whatever it
is we thought we knew about the
situation no I was speculating that it
was maybe our our intelligence people
had already penetrated it so maybe we
had some internal benefit we didn't know
about in other words you know maybe Tik
Tock has some terrorists on it and you
know it's better to keep it the way it
is and the terrorists don't know that we
can
you know I was thinking there may be
some
argument for keeping it that's security
related that's nonobvious you know maybe
opposite of what it looks like sort of
thing but then I find out that the
people who are uh
uncharacteristically acting like they're
idiots when we know they're
not um have a gigantic Financial benefit
at least two of the four and the other
two are suspected so it looks like it's
exactly what it looks like it looks like
for money they have um picked a uh
position which would be bad for American
children now the Press is making a
pretty big deal about it so we'll see
we'll see if this becomes news now
remember my theme my theme was that the
public doesn't change their vote because
of anything
complicated This is complicated because
you would have to understand you know
the whole Tick Tock nature sure the
business model what would happen if they
sold it could they sell it would the
Chinese government sell it what's really
different from you know Facebook
compared to this is it really just First
Amendment so you'd have to know the
Constitution you'd have to know business
models you'd have to be following the
story you'd have to know you know how
politics
works so um let's talk about this from
the I guess I don't have to to make a
moral or ethical argument about
anything you're all you're all perfectly
capable of doing that right so you don't
need to know what I think of this given
that um let me tell you I conflate in my
mind Tik Tock and
Fentanyl now you might not and and I
don't mean just because sometimes we say
Tik Tock is digital fenel which it is
the reason I conflate them um is that uh
the Chinese Communist
Party provides the fenal precursors and
you famously you know that my stepson
died from a fental overdose in
2018 so I hold I have a personal grudge
against China and when I see them
sending another form of fenel this case
digital fenel I just conflate
them so in my in my just personal
World
um you know what I think think about it
I don't need I don't need to detail it
do
I so here's what I'm going to do uh I'm
going to talk about these four
individuals going forward um just
calling balls and Strikes yeah I'm just
going to say when they do something
that's let's say persuasive and when
it's not and I'll talk about the
interesting stories but I'm not going to
endorse anybody for
president you okay with
that from from an ethical and moral
stand I can't I can't endorse
Trump because of this now let's talk
about the strategy of it though the
political strategy of it might be
brilliant let's talk about
that um number one just because it came
out of a bipartisan committee 50 to zero
does that mean it was ever going to pass
the Congress because that matters if it
was never going to
pass that all Trump did was pick up free
money you see what I'm saying if if he
was sure it wasn't going to pass because
it didn't have the votes and maybe it
wouldn't have the votes because this
Republican billionaire would make sure
it didn't have the votes so suppose
Trump knew it couldn't
pass in that situation if he made a deal
that said all right I'll I'll say I'm
for keeping Tick Tock if you'll fund my
campaign it's just free money because it
was going to pass it it was going to do
what it was going to do no matter what
Trump did Trump doesn't have a vote he
doesn't have a veto being out of office
and you could argue oh he could persuade
his Republicans no he couldn't no he
couldn't he he probably can't he's not
so persuasive he can just make them vote
for something that's against their best
interest so in their best interest would
be keeping a big donor on their side so
it could be that Trump is just playing
it um like a poker game and he's saying
if I'm in favor of the ban I get no
money and I get no
ban you're following me if if he had
agreed to continue saying let's ban it
he would get no funding and he also
wouldn't get a ban you'd get nothing if
he says all right you know inexplicably
I'm going to change my mind let's keep
this Tik Tock stuff then he gets funding
he could become president
and once president in the second term
guess
what he's not beholden to anybody after
that so it's entirely possible that he's
Willie Browning this situation you know
Willie Brown he was a big San FR well
California politician and uh he accepted
money from some tobacco company for his
campaign at the same time that there was
a some legislation about banning smoking
in indoors I guess and somebody said how
can you possibly be objective you know
if you're taking money from the company
you're voting on their product and
Willie Brown famously said if you can't
take money from somebody and then turn
around and stab them in the back you're
in the wrong
business now that was the moment that I
loved Willie
Brown I like God that's the most honest
thing I've ever heard a politician ever
say and and indeed indeed the law went
against the tobacco companies So Not
only was it true he proved it he took
their money and then he screwed him and
he did it publicly and right in front of
us okay I'm all right with
that so if it turned out that um let's
say this billionaire got his liquidity
event sometime during the second term of
trump do you think that Trump might have
a change of heart after his friend got
his money out
maybe so he might get both he might get
the money and he might also ban it
that's a possibility but it's not going
to happen as long as that billionaire
has got money in the company that's my
guess um and I think that uh politically
if Trump looks like the one who and the
funny thing is that now Biden wants to
ban it you know they they have to be on
opposite sides now Biden's strength is
the young voters who love them some Tik
Tock so now Biden is opposed to Tik
Tock and Trump is in favor of keeping it
and what is the depth of analysis that
the young people will put into this
allow me to demonstrate Tick Tock
yes or ticktock
no that's
it that's it they are not going to be
thinking about the geopolitical
implications of the Chinese Communist
Party influencing United States politics
they're going to be where's my reals
What do they call them where where's my
Tik
toks so it could be that Trump wins
simply by being looking like he's Pro
free speech looking like he's Pro Tik
Tock even though what's really happening
is that there's nothing he could do
either way about it so he might as well
take the free money
um and he would certainly be playing to
win you know you know one one of the
things that people say about the
Republicans even Republicans say about
it is why do they play to
lose have you noticed that it's like
Republicans sometimes will do things
maybe on a principle but they're like
well this principal is so important
we're going to lose the election I don't
think Trump makes that
mistake one of the things you can hate
about him and love about him at the same
time is he's playing to
win I think this is a clear example that
he does need the
money and it would help him win and uh
it's going to be
expensive
so so I'm not going to endorse I think
that's that's a line I'm not going to
cross I think tiktock is dangerous to
the youth but if it turns out Trump has
taken the free money and then he bans it
later I'll change my
opinion all right um coincidentally
Trump made the 92 billion Bond he had to
put up in order to challenge the EG and
Carol defamation case ah well Trump's
got some money now
huh all right uh Trump's also uh got
some legal bills he tried to uh sue the
Christopher steel organization I guess
that had pushed the so-called Russia
collusion
hoax
and uh he lost that so now he has to pay
the legal fees of the other side and the
reason he lost it is that I guess the
judge ruled that even though the dossier
was a bunch
of defamation and Bs they quote never
intended to make the dossier
public never intended to make it public
that was only purpose which we know
because of legal proceedings in this
country so this this happened in I guess
England uh but now do you think do you
think you you've learned enough about
how the legal system works as long as
you can shop for a
location you can convict anybody you can
have any any um civil suit outcome you
just have to pick the right place for
the case it has nothing to do with with
the evidence
apparently so evidence doesn't matter
looks like RFK Jr is possibly going to
look at being a joining the libertarian
party primarily because the libertarian
party has ballot access and I guess most
are all the states and RFK Jr on his own
is doing great getting ballot access but
isn't getting them all might be a
problem getting them all so that's a
possibility uh I'd like to make a
conditional prediction more a
statistical
prediction um why are we assuming that
the president has to be one of the two
people Trump or Biden just because
they're going to be the party nominees
probably isn't that isn't that a a
dangerous
assumption so I would like to add to the
mix that there's at least a 30% chance
that neither Trump nor Biden will be
president uh Biden has an obvious you
know mental health and health risk and
even the Democrats might want to keep
them out of office if it gets a little
bit
worse um even more than they want to
keep him out now and Trump has the
lawfare risk plus you know God knows
what opposition research plus God knows
what kind of uh I don't
know who who knows what kind of hoaxes
they're going to pull on them if you
look at the history of hoax
the 2016
election was the Russia collusion hoax
the 2020 election was the fine people
hoax and the 2024 election is the
January 6 Insurrection hoax combined
with the dictator for a day
hoax for three elections in a row the
Democrats have run primarily on a
hoax now why am I the only person who
says that out loud shouldn't that that
be you know sort of the framing of every
newscast from now on well the Democrats
who have a unbroken string of hoax
related campaigns here's their new one
don't you think the fact that if you
only run on
hoaxes that ought to be something that
the news mentions on a you know fairly
regular basis when you're talking about
them you know I'm sure John
Dillinger uh has done Le did legal
things as well as his vast you know
repertoire of
crime so if you're going to talk about
John Dillinger you wouldn't talk about
that time he did the legal thing I feel
like it would be completely important
that every time John Diller comes up
that you make sure that the people know
you're talking about a major
criminal
right it seems the same the the Democrat
Party is really just a criminal
organization
if you run three presidential campaigns
on known obvious
hoaxes you are a criminal
organization to imagine that that's just
politics now I get that all politicians
lie and the fact checks and the
hyperbole but three completely made up
hoaxes no that's criminal organization I
I can't call that
politics
all
right so it's entirely possible that RFK
Jr will be the last standing um major
politician so I would say that RFK Jr's
chances of being president
are almost the same as Trump and uh and
Biden because Biden has you know good
chance of not making it to the finish
line and the bad people are going to try
everything to stop Trump so even if
Trump doesn't you know shoot himself in
the foot we don't know how far they're
willing to go so they could be uh they
could be cranking up the uh the lawfare
they could be uh cheating on the
election they could be planning an
assassination there's almost no limit to
what could
happen anyway so I would say that given
that the two major candidates uh have a
a
real tough hurdle to even be there on
Election Day I think it's a three-way
race and it doesn't look that way
because no nobody's going to say they'll
vote for RFK Jr if one of the other
candidates is in there that they like
but if you imagine neither of them are
there what's it look
like let me ask let me say it again if
you imagine that neither Trump nor Biden
make it to the end and then you imagine
that RFK Jr is on every ticket but he
might be running against somebody else
in both cases he might be running
against somebody else could he
win if both parties have to do a last
minute substitution who's that going to
be who's it going to be I don't
know so maybe they're VP choices I don't
know so I guess the Haiti is uh bask a
case and the jails have been emptied by
the criminals themselves and um and yet
a federal judge here is ruled that
30,000 would be Asylum Seekers from four
countries but ha is one of them um can
enter the us and continue to do it so so
the the the government is flying in
extra migrants who maybe couldn't get to
hear on their own so we're actually
flying fing them in maybe over 300,000 a
year and that that's now legal and just
built into the system well here's what
we can conclude parents or adults in
general you are on your own for the
following topics because your government
has basically taken a pass you are on
your own for fenel there's nobody coming
to
help nobody's coming to help if you have
a
kid only you can stop it their friends
won't stop them from doing fenel the
dealers won't stop them the government
won't stop them neither government not
Republican not Democrat it's not going
to happen so you're on your own don't
wait for the government and if you have
Addiction in the family A kid if you
have a kid who's addicted I don't know
if all of you know this the government
won't do anything there there is no
service you have to have a addict in
your house and you can't kick him
out do you know what it's like to have a
drug addict in your house they can't
kick
out it's really bad it's really really
bad so you're on your own for fenal
you're on your own for Tik Tock
apparently I don't think there's any
chance the ban will get past um you're
on your own for the uh failing schools
so maybe if you can get them
homeschooled or something but you're on
your own because the government
basically is giving up on
school and you're on your own for the
Border crisis um meaning that you you
know obviously you can't personally
board guard the Border but um as Bill
akman said his neighbor you assume Bill
lman lives in a good neighborhood he's a
billionaire he just tweeted or posted
that his neighbor got
burgled and
uh um oh I've been I've been cautioned
not to call it
burglary it's an undocumented visitor
who has your stuff it's very different
very different so yeah uh you should
probably arm yourself um two of my
neighbors houses have been hit by the
migrant uh bands and when I say my
neighbors I mean really close neighbors
I'm not talking in my ZIP code I'm
talking I can hit him with a rock two of
them in burgled so you know we are of
course locally hardening our
defenses so my neighbor is organized
into practically a paramilitary
organization that's true but the my
neighborhood has only one entry and one
exit you know there's not a second way
to get out and we're going full
paramilitary now we we don't talk about
weapons because we we're connected
digitally so nobody talks about weapons
smartly right so no no mention of
weapons but um our organiz organ
Organization for uh spotting people who
don't belong is really tight I'll tell
you if you park your truck on our street
and somebody doesn't recognize it
because we don't really have street
parking here except visitors um you're
going to get you're going to get
surrounded pretty quickly so my
neighborhood has just decided to go
screw the government screw the police
we're on our own and I think you're
going to see a lot of that so the
government isn't coming to help on any
of those things of fenel tiktock failing
schools or the Border crisis so you
better Harden your home
defense in other news uh the uh Fire
Department in New York was some event in
which Leticia James the Attorney General
attended as a speaker and she was booed
booed by number of firefighters and what
will happen um as end wokeness reports
on X uh the firefighters are asked to
turn themselves in or risk being haunted
down
that's right more Republicans are being
hunted for having a free speech opinion
that the Attorney General is a horrible
horrible criminal and should be in
jail so you can't have that opinion
apparently you'll lose your job and uh
you'll be hunted down so one of my best
predictions unfortunately correct that
Republicans are being haunted every
day all right here's my my advice for
the Republicans if they want to win
everything if you want to lose
everything just keep doing what you're
doing on abortion and
IVF but it would be real easy not to so
let me make a suggestion just in case
Republicans want to win everything
forever because it's really right there
for them to take now I know you're not
going to do it and and I know from prior
conversations that I'm just going to get
screamed at in the
comments the Republicans would win
everything if they simply say abortion
should be decided by
women not just in the moment you know
that's if it's legal you know with their
doctor but what the law should be now I
know what you're saying Scott it's
murder everybody has a an interest in
Murder yes you do and your interest is
exactly the the same as the women's
there are women Republicans and there
are women Democrats and your opinions
aren't that different than the women in
your
party but if you can just allow the
Democrat women who are primarily running
the Democrat Party to feel that you've
at least given them that women should be
the primary decision makers about what
happens to women's bodies now you say to
yourself no no we all must be involved
because it's murdering
children it's still murdering children
no matter who's talking it's still the
same argument you don't need to be in it
you're not so special your little voice
about this topic probably doesn't make
any difference to anybody just like mine
doesn't and shouldn't so if the only
thing you're adding is killing the
chances of your political party to
win why are you doing it do you think
that your opinion will change
anything now you I'm not saying you
shouldn't vote you can vote any way you
want but when you're talking about it
the only way you can talk about it and
be uh both morally and ethically pure
but also maybe win is to say you know
you have an opinion but you're going to
defer to the women in your party because
they say the same thing you do but it's
more credible coming from them so you
might say I'm not going to back down one
and you certainly have that right and I
wouldn't try to talk you out of it so
yeah let me make this clear I'm not
suggesting what you should
do did it probably sounded like that
didn't it it's not a recommendation it's
not a recommendation because I know you
won't do
it I'm just saying that the Republican
party is a millimeter away from winning
everything presidency and you know both
sides of Congress and already has a
dominant position in the courts so if
the Republicans wanted to win everything
and then
fix everything they could
fix there's a way to do it just let the
women take the lead the Republican women
and as Ben say we're going to support
the
women but let them do the speaking and
just pipe down just pipe down because
your point of view will be
completely better expressed by people
who are in a better position to express
it right so if you think that you being
quiet and taking a you know taking a
step back and letting women take the
lead if you think that gets you to a
worse
place what's wrong with
you you think women are not good at
advocating for what they want in what
world is that a
problem and women are really really good
at advocating for what they want like
really really really good so why do you
think you would be damaged in any way
just because your own opinion wasn't in
the public sphere you know so I think
you have to worry about not worry but
consider whether your need to have an
opinion on this
topic is based on your best assessment
of your risks and your
rewards if if you're if you're coming at
it purely from a moral standpoint I do
respect it yeah I completely respect a
moral lonely position just know that the
tradeoff is that you don't get to win
everything and you could you're you're a
millimeter away from owning the
government but you've youve put up an
obstacle to yourself that I think is
pretty hard to get
past all right um I don't want to hear
arguments about uh men are responsible
too because that's off point I don't
want to hear that men have good opinions
too because that has nothing to do with
my point you're you all have good
opinions that's not the question it's
just do you want to
win that's it if you want to win there's
an easy way to do it and you don't give
up anything in the
process all right
um here's some numbers I put on migrant
crime might be useful
um 20% of American women and that's
probably a low number have experienced
an attempted or completed
rape in your experience isn't that
number
low may maybe it's you know maybe rape
is too specific and it should be you
know all the sexual
attacks uh I feel like I feel like the
number of women who have had some kind
of sex crime against them would be well
over half isn't it isn't it well over
half am am I so wrong about that
and I'm just saying observationally and
anecdotally
anecdotally um if I were to you know
just randomly picked 10 women do you
think only two of the 10 I randomly
picked would say they'd ever had um kind
of a sexual attack I feel like it'd be
half is your experience different I'm
looking at your
comments I I feel half of been had some
kind of sex crime against them that they
didn't necessarily
report all right but let's use the lower
number let's say that the 20% is is more
of a you know definitely that was rape
kind of a number or attempted rape what
happens if you double the number of men
in your ZIP code but not the number of
women
hypothetically if you just magically
doubled the number of
men but no extra women wouldn't
it if if if the number if the people
coming in the extra men had the same
rate of rape which is about 1% 1% of men
admit being
rapists which also sounds low frankly it
feels like it's higher than 1% but let's
say it's 1% if you brought in um 10
million
migrants and that's probably a low
number because you know there's a lot
that we just can't count because they
get away uh but let's say that the the
number who are just met were 10 million
there are women and children but let's
just say the adult man were most of it
and 10 million just for back of the
envelope calculations and you could you
could tweak these as you want but 1% of
10 million would be 100,000 extra
rapists and if a lot of men came into
your neighborhood your rate of rape
Could It Go from 20% of women to
40% because you doubled the number
number of men but not the double number
of women am I doing the math right now I
know it's not as straightforward as that
but is the is the generally
directionally do I have the math right
not technically but
directionally does that sound right to
you if you double the number of
men if those men had the same average
rape percentage as all the other men who
are already here you know which is
another conversation then wouldn't it
double your
rape how would it not I mean how how
could it not do
that now again you but you know you're
not going to double the number of men in
any zip code so you adjust that as
well but uh you know I'm not going to
get into the the argument about whether
the migrants have a higher rape rate
right because whether that's true or
not
um you can make the entire argument just
by number of men
if you add the number of men your rape
should go up so I would say 100,000
extra
rapists
and um a lot of rapists are serial
rapists so of the 100,000 that doesn't
mean 100,000 extra rapes because you
know maybe 5% of them are the multiples
they're they're doing twice as much so
100,000 rapists might
be you know 200,000 extra rapes
per
year now Biden has to justify 200,000
extra
rapes for the benefit that were um being
kind to the immigrants because we're
we're an immigrant country and that's
not
nothing you know the reason that so many
of us have mixed opinions is that
immigration is not only a positive if
you do it right it's an essential it
it's Way Beyond optional
it's
essential we we really couldn't have a
country with our Birthright unless we
had some
robust um and you know look at the
number of um immigrants from the Past
who are now CEOs of major unicorn
companies I mean we're way better off
because of past migration but the part
that you do right right you want to do
it
right so here's how that's how I would
argue it and if I were uh if I were
trying to make this this case about the
danger coming in I would make sure I
used both percentages and um numbers
what do I say when people only use
percentages that's how you lie you leave
out the raw number what do I say when
people only use the raw number that's
how you lie because you're leaving out
the percentage so if you're going to use
this argument don't use one or the other
don't use just the number and don't use
just the percentage you put them
together then that's a real argument now
people can reject it you there there
might be Democrat women who say you know
what 200,000 extra rapes to protect uh
10 million extra people who are in a bad
way uh I'll take that
deal but they need to say it out
loud just make the case because you know
we're adults we get to argue the real
world the real world is this is a
trade-off it's not the only trade-off
it's one trade-off so let people say you
know put the Democrats on the uh let's
say on the I don't want to say defensive
but make them make them explain why this
is what they
want do you do you think you could get
the Democrat women to say yes I
understand there will be 200,000 extra
rapes per year probably per year
um but I'm okay with that because the
benefit is even
greater now that's that that is the
balance you you don't get to say that
it's all benefit no cost you have to say
I understand the costs I understand the
benefits and I choose this
one because I do like if if if I were to
analyze the cost of closing the Border
completely I would throw in the fact
that it would really screw a a lot of
companies that depend on that labor
that's a cost it's real it's big so just
make sure you doing all the costs and
all the benefits and then make them
defend
it Ted Cruz went ballistic uh in me in a
hearing uh he went ballistic on May
orcus I think it's a
current um new video
but I guess Ted Cruz was showing the
wristbands that the migrants are getting
from the cartels the cartels are so
organized that they have wristbands with
different colors to indicate you know
what kind of Migrant you are so that the
cartels themselves can sort them out on
either end and apparently mayorcas if I
understood this right was not aware of
the wristband
program and and Ted Cruz just went nuts
on him for
being well for being mayorcas and not
even understanding how deep this problem
is because part of these wristbands um I
only saw a summary of the story but
maybe you can give me a confirmation was
Ted cruzing Ted Cruz saying so this is a
question not a statement was Ted Cruz
saying the some of those wristbands were
worn by people who were intended to be
sexually
trafficked the
children is do I have that right because
I don't know if I have that right I need
a confirmation of that did he say that
some of them because there were
different kinds of wristbands were some
of them literally for sex
trafficking I'm not I'm not entirely
sure if there was but well I'm seeing
okay I'm seeing some yeses I do think
that's what it was now I think that's
the attack Vector that's the strongest
attack
Vector well
um so Zero Hedge is uh mocking the jobs
reports um you know the old thing where
the jobs reports come out and Biden says
my God it's the best jobs report ever
reelect me and then a month later it
gets lowered and then the month after it
gets yeah lowered a little bit again and
then nobody notices the lowering even
though people scream about it you know
nobody it's never a news story and
apparently according to Zero Hedge uh
they do it for everything you know jobs
something called jolts I don't even know
what that is new home sales housing
starts industrial production pce and
core
PC uh price Consumer Price stuff so
apparently all of our data that comes
from the government is fake it's
knowingly fake it's knowingly fake and a
lot of it is um like the jobs report a
lot of it is uh uh migrants getting jobs
and part-time jobs that aren't as good
and uh government jobs that we wish we
were not increasing the number of
so it's true that our jobs report and
all our economic data is
fake um and it's true that the New York
Times bestseller list is
fake and it's true that the reasons for
Banning or not wanting to ban Tik Tock
are
fake but you know what's
lucky thank God our climate models are
Dependable am I right because with
everything else being
fake you know it's just so lucky that
the climate models are real no ladies
and gentlemen I'm being sarcastic
climate models have one and only one
purpose the purpose of a climate model
is to launder your
assumptions you do not use a climate
model to tell you what's going to happen
in the future
because I'm I'm going to have to do a
Biden whisper on
this permission to do a Biden
whisper all right I'm going to do a
Biden
whisper the
reason you use climate models is not
because climate models can predict the
future because nothing can
nothing can predict the future why did
anybody ever believe
that if you could predict the future of
the climate you could predict
anything that's the hardest one if you
can get that one right everything else
is easy no the purpose of climate models
is to launder your assumptions that
other people would just say I don't
think that's true here's an assumption
uh glaciers going to melt all the polar
bears going to die your uh your uh sea
level rise you're all going to be
underwater well can you prove it
well I can't prove the future well then
why would I believe anything you say
have you seen my climate
models and then they convince you that
the models are something like science
the models are not science those are
just your assumptions that you launder
through this complicated thing
so people think there's some science to
it that's what that is all right here's
an update on Rafa the southern city in
Gaza that uh Israel wants to you know
clean it out and go in there but they're
holding off and trying to get the
residents out I guess the residents are
not willing to leave or enough of them
um and there's talk about hostage
exchange but none of that's going to
happen and there's talk talk about the
US building a pier so that we can drop
off lots of food to the
Palestinians does that sound like a good
idea to
you do you know that the Palestinians
are not lacking for
food what they're lacking for is a way
to uh not have it stolen by
Hamas but there's
food so the United States is not solving
the right problem apparently we didn't
have a lack of food to give them there
was enough food in the area is just that
they can't get it in you know if the
residents would leave the
area then they could all be fed but you
know they're they're sticking with it I
guess anyway so Biden has said that if
Israel the military goes into Rafa while
those civilians are mostly still there
he says it's a red
line um Now what is a red line there a
Red Line you're going to do something to
Israel so if they cross that red line
like that's that's the definition of a
red line in politics right a red line is
just somebody crosses it oh you're in
trouble you're in trouble if you cross
that red line so what's going to happen
Biden says it is a red line but I'm
never going to leave Israel the defense
of Israel is still critical so there is
no red
line oh so there is no red line I'm
going to cut off all weapons so they
don't have the Iron Dome to protect them
so basically it's a red
line but not one that has any
consequences that that would be called
the opposite of a red line that would be
like a
nothing all right now I'm not saying you
know that he should have consequences
I'm just saying he's talking nonsense he
wants to have it both ways there's a red
line but there's no penalty for crossing
the red line that's like not a red
line
anyway um part of that story is that
Biden said he didn't want to see another
30,000 people killed in Gaza do you see
the problem with
that tell me the problem Biden says he
doesn't want to see another 30,000
killed in
Gaza there is a problem with that oh
yeah 30,000 is hamas's estimate which
Israel will tell you not so
reliable which means that Biden has
embraced the number that is repeated the
most the Hamas number now Israel can't
counter that because they don't produce
their own
number so they can't say no no the real
number is whatever because probably the
real num is too big as well right if it
turned out the real number is
20,000 is that going to fundamentally
change how you feel about this situation
you know The Big Numbers we don't
register so
differently so the Hamas propaganda has
worked the Hamas propaganda that it was
30,000 so far which we have no idea how
accurate or not that is Biden has now
referred to it as though that's the
metric to refer
to hos wins propaganda
Victory so ladies and
gentlemen amazingly somehow I completed
this using nothing but LTE on my phone
uh later this
afternoon um my internet company says
they'll come out and fix a problem they
say is on their end and then maybe maybe
we'll have a Solutions all right and uh
that's all I got for today is there
anything I forgot any story I forgot to
mention um I'm just seeing lots of
insults of
Biden lots of Biden
insults do you think I should reissue my
book win bigle for this election season
because it's all about Trump's
