Thanksgiving what we've got here is a
very special
version of coffee with Scott Adams I'm
going to be doing a little drawing of a
cartoon today
live and also reminding
you that the only place you can get the
Dilbert 2025 calendar is at the link you
can find at dilbert.com and I've got
some other books that you can you can
buy as presents because is I think all
your friends would want
them so uh this program will
be rated
G in case you want to bring your friends
and show them how to draw a
comic I'll show you what I'm using here
as a as a
tool I don't see any comments yet there
we go
comments so I'll be using this uh this
tool it's a very thin very light
device that is sold by
Wacom it's called a move
ink and I could show it to you if I get
this off its
leg so can you can you see
the can you
see the label mov
in so I've tried a number of these
little devices that connect to a
computer my main computer is the one you
see right here so this is this is the uh
the big
guy
um but it's not portable so I like to
work in different places like my man
cave
Etc so I got used to the small portable
and it's terrific it's
terrific so anyway this is made by Wacom
and both of them use a
stylus which means that you draw Direct
ly
on on the thing with it now it comes
with this weird little half glove
because your hand is on the device and
it just keeps your hand oils away from
it um
oh family friends of the 33 333
rip don't like the sound of that
H I should be wearing my beanie hat let
me fix
that beanie hat coming
on there we
go you can get the beanie hat at uh just
just
Google coffee with Scott Adams and
merchandise it'll pop right up all right
so the first first thing we need to do
is is write a
comic so I don't have a comic idea
yet so I'm going to open up my locals
app on my
phone because then I can see their
comments
separately and what they're going to do
since they've done this
before they're going to give me ideas
for
comics and then I'm going to draw one
right in front of you so I'll write it
in front of you and then draw it in
front of
you
huh now it would seem to
me that I should be able to see
myself is there a reason I'm not
visible to
myself come on Scott you can find
yourself it's fun because it's placed
randomly
huh I'll be damned so I'm live streaming
on locals but it's not on locals is
there anybody on
locals oh
 how
fun it's everywhere except the main
place that it needed to
be well looks like we're going to have
to do a separate screen
here all right all
right I'm going to do a separate uh
screen so the people on the locals
platform are
watching man cave with
drawing get in here
now all right so if you haven't seen it
this is the uh the locals app
so this is a subscription service these
are the people who have the most
interest in watching my content both the
comics and the political
stuff so here they are going
live and uh comments are streaming
in so I had a little technical
difficulty guys on
locals um so you're not coming through
the
studio which means
you're going to get
the I'm going to give you this
view there we go you're going to have
that
view and then I can show you my work
when I have it so here's here's what I'm
getting ready to
do I'm going to be drawing writing a
comic and here I am in the local studio
so so I'm showing locals what the rest
of you look like and then then you can
see what locals looks like so locals is
streaming right
now all right what we're going to
do is first we need an
idea does anybody have
one Happy
Thanksgiving you're feeding the kids and
you're blessed well this is a perfect
live stream to go with your dinner
Point here resisting I don't want to do
Dei again because I've done that too
much so if anybody has some ideas of
anything that's bugging you
about the world or about
work I was thinking of doing one about
with where
Wall-E um is the only person who goes to
work and he's gone native and he's he's
just wearing a loin
cloth because he's the only one
there uh it's not going to be robots re
news this is going to be a dilber
comic yeah you're going to you're going
to watch the actual creation and writing
process followed by the
drawing so I'll tell you what I'm doing
as I go so you can kind of learn so the
first thing I do if you're just comeing
in is I have a template and I have a
drawing pad so it's a digital drawing
pad it's connected to my computer if you
missed the first part of the live stream
that describes where it is and if you
want one I'm not selling them I'm just
just describing it now did you know the
dilber calendar is available but only at
the link at dilbert.com
that's right all right so I have one
idea and the test of an idea is if it's
funny before you write the the dialogue
so should be a funny
concept so one
concept is that Wally is going to work
in the office because there's nobody
else there and then you know what would
Wally
do so I'm I'm controlling my
light um do you see Bill Mar gave a
Roden
glove GM of Jaguar oh yeah Raw lover
yeah five calendars you're getting
tomorrow good for you Wally takes OIC
and gets thin but how was that
funny so here's the your first writing
tip you cannot make a funny joke about a
medical
problem that's that's number one can't
make a joke about a medical problem not
because not only because it will offend
some people but you just can't do it and
nobody's ever made a joke about a
medical
problem that you remember and say oh I
remember that medical problem joke the
other thing you can't do is food related
jokes you can do them but it's a sign of
a bad
writer um studying things that will
never be used and the common sense would
tell us you work a scientist whose
entire career is studying things will
never be used
expand on Beth I don't know if she'll be
a
regular lame
AI he has
blackmail H how about the person who
runs the all right let's let's do the
blackmail theme because that
that that seems to roughly
follow the real world so you can imagine
it working in the office but it's based
on something you're that you're familiar
now I've got a character called morak
the preventor of Information
Services so first thing I'm going to
do is get my cursor over
here and I'll show you as I go but not I
won't show you necessarily
every every letter that I
write
but let's see you guys are going to come
over
here see if there's any way I can get
you to see this well kind
of kind of you won't see it as this
happen but trust me it's like
radio so I've got a little uh technical
setup that I've never used before so
I've got
on a computer I haven't used so who
knows what's going to happen but I uh I
use a uh font of my own
handwriting oh my God there's
a there's a thing that appears on
Photoshop that just gets in the way of
whatever you're
doing and it's
automatic
seriously all right so it takes like
five minutes just to get all the
Photoshop debris out of the way so you
can type
something all right so first panel of a
Sunday cartoon this will be a larger one
with eight
panels uh will be the introduction of
the
idea so I'm going to have the boss uh
ask um morak to do
something can you
give me an update on the
network status so that's just sort of
generic give me a update on the
network so I'll I'll show you
this all right
so it's just uh it's just typing my own
handwriting
and it's highlighted right now but the
black background will go away when I
click on
it so the first first panel how many
people do we have here I don't know how
many people are on on
X but uh let's put you up here give you
the alternative view if you by the way
if you're on locals and you don't like
that view you can jump on the other if
you jump on one of the other platforms
like X or YouTube or Rumble you will
have this view so if you
care if it
matters all right so the first panel is
MC can you give me an update on this
network
status now I'm going to
introduce the
problem and BX
says that sounds
hard how about
I don't do
that would you put a question mark after
that because it's sort of like not
really a question if you say how about I
don't do
that um then the blackmail comes
in so in the third
panel morak
it starts
hinting you know I can see all of
your
network
traffic and
sites now I can see all of the sites you
visited now I can see all of
your
messages and the sites you have the
websites
pages and then the boss is going to have
to have some reaction to
that what would the boss's reaction
be so the first three panels
uh I need a digital calendar app by the
way if you're trying to get the dilber
calendar the only place you can find the
sales button is at dilbert.com
you'll it's the the first thing at the
top of that page will take you to the
sales page and you probably want to get
it this week to make sure that uh you
don't have any problem with production
and shipping anything you buy today the
dilber calendar
probably you'd have it in your hands in
two weeks if you bought it today uh as
it gets closer to Christmas no
guarantees all right so boss says to
morak the preventor of Information
Systems morak can you give me an update
on the network status and morex says
that sounds hard how about I don't do
that and morex says you know I can see
all of your email messages and the web
pages you visit
uh and the boss would say what are you
trying to
say how
about I'm
saying
maybe you
don't want
the world to know about
your
love of tiny
horses Your Love of tiny horses is that
funny now normally since this is Dilbert
reborn I can make it naughty but because
it's Thanksgiving and families are
watching I'm going to I'm going to keep
it nice
so is it funny just to say that the boss
has a hobby of loving tiny
horses
no
about oh I got
one uh to know about
your
browsing of naked
animals B will say all
animals they'll say no animals wear
clothes no animals wear
clothes and then morak will
say organ grinder monkeys do
monkeys
do all right that's not very funny
anything with a monkey is
funny fuzzy cats
r p
peanut peanut the
squirrel all right so morc can you give
me an update that sounds
hard yeah that's not
funny so we're about this far
along in the writing of it see if I can
get the light so it doesn't destroy the
picture well trust me there's writing on
it so about this far
along you really can't see that can you
so I spent uh about an hour trying to
figure out how to get what I'm doing in
a separate window so there' just be a
window there but
apparently the software does not allow
Photoshop to be in a separate window
only some apps can be in the separate
window and this is not one of them
all
right let's see what's going on
there I got mentioned on H
maath you you laughed out loud at organ
organ grinder monkeys do
we put that in
there I didn't know how many people who
have been born more recently would even
know what a monkey an Oregon ground deer
monkey
is um
that's an
exception all right
well maybe you should send the kids
away I thought I could make this rated
G it turns out I can't do
it it'll be
PG or PG
G13 I'm I'm revising my estimate still
nothing too naughty no bad
words
um all right I got to write it and then
I'll tell you what I
all right but I have to hit the theme
that he's being blackmailed a little bit
harder
uh maybe you don't know want the world
to know
about your
web searches for
Naked
Animals I will show you the drawing
eventually there's a
pickpocket Pig pocket money named Jimmy
what all
right Di
staffers all right what's happening over
here on locals only 100 people the rest
of you with
family so if you're looking for
gifts my books are tremendous gifts
because they're in that low dollar
amount and you could almost always know
that somebody like them they're the best
books ever
written according to me all all
right all right we're going to say that
you got caught searching for pictures of
naked
monkeys
M all right morc is going to push back
harder instead if that sounds hard he's
going to
say I
could or I
could blackmail
you you know I can see all of your
email can see all of
your internet
traffic
uh you know I can see all of your web
usage
for naked
monkeys naked
animals
um so I need to write myself out of a
corner
here you getting over a stomach bug
so uh I have to give you a lesson on
sarcasm so so there's a member here who
is trying to be sarcastic in all caps
and he says oh oh I'm Scott Adams I'm so
amazing YouTube is fing me he means
throttling now here's a key for mocking
somebody with
sarcasm it doesn't work work if the
mocking is literally what's happening
and it's obvious to
everybody so here would be another bad
example of
sarcasm oh Scott Adams thinks he's
affected by gravity oh he's so important
he thinks gravity is affecting him well
see that doesn't
work because it's actually true that
gravity affects me so here would be
another one oh Scott he thinks he's a
human being cuz he acts like a human
being you just deonate like a human
being see doesn't work CU I'm actually a
human being likewise it is common
knowledge that YouTube is throbbing
certain people and my if you looked at
my YouTube traffic it's like completely
flat for
years which is almost
impossible whereas my other traffic and
other things is you know uh
normal so try harder with your s
M I need some good sarcasm not that not
the cheap stuff hey how come this isn't
working
uhoh this will
work all
right maybe you don't I'm saying maybe
you don't want want the world to know
about your web searches for naked
animals no animals have clothes organ
organ grinder monkeys do that's an
exception you search for naked
monkeys you searched for naked
monkeys to me that's pretty funny
all right now that boss has to say
something that's like the final
statement I
don't
need
a and that work I don't need to status
subject so he's just going to walk
away all right so let's save that so I
don't lose it
Macy sprayed was
sad you searched for shaved monkeys all
right I'll read it to you so you don't
have to see it but what I'm showing you
is that um all I did was type the words
because I created a font of my own
handwriting so it looks like the way I
would write except I type it I've been
doing that for I don't know 10 or 15
years so here's what it says the boss
will talk to morak who's the the
information Services guy and the boss
says morak can you give me an update on
the network status and MC says I could
or I could blackmail you you know I can
see all of your web
usage and the boss says what are you
trying to say morak says I'm saying
maybe you don't want the world to know
about your web searches for naked
animals and the boss says no animals
wear
clothes and morex says organ grinder
monkeys do the boss says that's an
exception and the last panel Mor morex
says you searched for naked monkeys and
the boss says I don't need a status
update what do you
think funny enough see I can't go full
funny
because then I get in
trouble all right let's see if there's
any way at
all I can adjust this so you can see
what I'm
doing and by the way if you didn't know
the dilber calendar is available at the
link at dilbert.com
all
right there's some nonzero chance I can
make this sort of
work maybe sort of but what I really
need is something to prop
up something
like
this h
something like this
book there you
go something like
that all all
right so if you're
on locals you're going to have a tough
time seeing
this all right none of you are going to
be able to see
the
well you might be see it a little bit so
when I do the actual drawing
I expand the
uh I zoom down so you'll be able to see
it a lot better when I zoom
huh why is that not
working why not that's
windows so I need to find the
navigator
navigator oh wow
really is this really
happening am I really having a dead pen
oh
no dead
pen No the uh the pen may have run out
of
energy which would be a weird and
terrible
coincidence all right so to make that
work I would need to find a charger of
that type
I can't remember if this is a
USBC oh
 I think we're done
here so I dropped my pen on the ground
the other
day and
it looks like what broke was the charger
port huh
so just so you know how my day is
going this is the tool I use every
single
day it has worked every single day since
I bought
it but the charging port got broken when
I dropped it on the
floor and now it's on of power
and it's the only one I
have so I just spent all afternoon
putting together this live stream so
that I could show you drawing in
person and there is no way to do it
there's no
backup uh I did however think to myself
yesterday you know what sooner or later
I'm going to I'm going to lose this
stylus or break it so I'm going to buy
an entirely new kit
um that would include a stylus and and
another drawing pad so that you know
because it's a business thing so I
always have a
backup uh oh and uh the batter is dying
on my locals feed so it would appear
that everything is going wrong
absolutely
everything it's a weird coincidence
however there's one possibility left
one possibility it's a long
shot but let me check
it cuz it's possible but not
[Music]
probable no I don't think the new one
has been
delivered n here I got to check on this
phone locals are you going to disappear
for a minute I'll be right back
all
right check Amazon and see if there's
any chance they left it in outside my
house that would be a weird weird
coincidence
uh and I just realized I didn't buy it
from them so that's not going to
work hey I'm
back I'm
back Shady's
back so let me
think could there be any other way to
charge
this I can't believe I didn't notice
that it was the charging part that broke
when that when I dropped
it it does come
[Music]
apart h
all
right ladies and gentlemen we're going
to bail out because this is a dismal
failure
um I tried as hard as I
could so it turns out just a total
failure the
uh the the
problem with the drawing with a St and
with the
technology is um I probably had to
solve five distinct technical problems
just to get to you to the point where
the stylist ran out of power and by the
way it worked five minutes ago how could
it not
work is it really possible that it only
ran in of energy at the exact time I
wanted to use it I wonder if there's
something else going
on no it's not
something else is going on you know what
there might be a way to save
this might be savable what I'm going to
do
is close and
reopen um
Photoshop cuz it's starting to look like
the problem might be the app and not the
stylist I still have a broken stylist I
can't charge but they do last a long
time and it would be a weird coincidence
that it
died okay we're getting all kinds of
artifacts and
stuff it'd be quite the
coincidence if it died at the precise
moment that I needed it most the odds of
that seemed
low so we're going into author
mode oh my god did I just lose the whole
feed
okay I think I lost the uh entire
feed file open
recent
Sunday well let's see if the pen Works
nope is not
work what is going
on or or does
it
wait does not
work oh
damn all
right did I disappear there
oh
my my oh
my you got a
jet well that didn't work
so I don't
know uh there's one other thing I could
try want me to try one other thing
one other thing to try all right I'm
going to pull
the pull the cord on
this I have a backup
laptop so just in case the problem was
on the
laptop we can now determine
that CU it would be the same stylus and
same Photoshop and
everything
so just imagine how cool it would be if
any of this worked I mean just totally
cool
but it seems I've removed Photoshop from
this because I could only have two
photoshops open
so I removed it from this machine just
before I started
working if you think about the number of
coincidences that are thwarting me it's
see it's the time that the stylus
coincidentally runs out of energy which
rarely
happens at the same time I move
Photoshop off of the one machine that
works and onto the one that
doesn't I don't know it's a lot of
coincidences let's see if I can move it
back we'll
see
oh except I have to use an app that's on
my phone so locals you're going to
disappear I think for a
minute um it's called the
Adobe count
access and it needs to know my
number
approved
sorry so
then
ooh what if this
works I will be like the bees
knes oh I think it's going to make me
like download the LA the app for 45
minutes even though I already have the
app on my
laptop it could not be more
annoying all right author mode in case
you wondered is where you recognize that
you're part of the
simulation and that
you're part of the ability to author
things so if this opens with
Photoshop it will be an amazing
thing I'm about halfway to knowing if
this laptop
Works have you noticed that when you go
to a dentist or you any have any kind of
doctor appointment where they're doing
something unusual and you don't know if
it's going to take 45 minutes or 5
seconds and they don't tell you have you
ever had that where like you go in for
some medical
or dental
thing and they'll say all right
seriously it's
not server oh my God Adobe server is not
responding okay what what are the odds
that adobe itself would go down right
now like Adobe is out of business right
now
Adobe so at the same time I stylist runs
out of
power the Adobe the adobe's uh servers
go
down you think that that's even possible
at the same
time
okay all right try
this so here's what's going on the Adobe
is a subscription service now so if you
want to use it on more than one machine
it's authorized on two machines with the
plan that I have uh you have to turn one
off and deactivate it so it's on the
other but it's real easy all it just
shows you which ones are activated and
you just click the other one so there's
no there's no work involved except that
it tells me sorry oobe says our server
is not responding please try
again wh which by the way worked fine
five minutes before I turned on the live
stream this is really
happening these are really just not
responding I'll be
darned let's try it
again we're going to hit it with the
default all right all
right you know author mode isn't uh
Magic my liberal ant getting
roasted oh I can't wait for my robot do
you know how many times we going have
problems with my
robot mpic
[Music]
Pro hey look at that simply turning it
off it on worked so we've gotten one
step
closer to the
idea
oh now my only problem is I opened the
wrong
file which is a separate
problem that means that the file I want
might exist somewhere
but where would it
be so I'm looking for
[Music]
121 so the two computers are both
working on my Dropbox but they don't
appear to be
synced which means that the file I
created on my other
laptop is not available in the cloud to
this laptop even though they're both
looking at exactly the same looking at
the same thing in the cloud but it
didn't translate to the
cloud so but can I be sure of that have
you noticed that search doesn't work on
any computer have you noticed that like
if you search your your your text
messages and you know you know that
there's stuff there it won't find it if
you search an
email
sometimes but if you search your
computer for a file
how often does that
work so I'm going to search for the file
name
because oh that's
interesting it says it's there
huh well this could be
interesting ah I found
it all right now the next technical
question
is will it be
possible to hook up my drawing
pad oh well let see if the stylus works
I think the stylus will
work oh no
seriously oh God no this stylus actually
was out of
power there's just no
oh I'll do this PG PG there's just no
way that this is the time is it decided
not to
work it's just not possible that this
exact moment is when it died because I I
I made sure it worked before I even went
live so it literally worked moments
ago so why would this not be working oh
I got an idea
wait we're not done
yet we're not
defeated turns out something wasn't
plugged
in that makes a big
difference plugging stuff
in all right you're going to have a much
better look at
things under this scenario
much
better
now stop
it ah it's
working look at
us author
mode so let me give you a better better
look
see I don't know that I can get
you so that you're looking down
there I don't think there's a way to do
it go
sideways anyway we we're going to start
with
that and then I I'll show you as I go
this is the part you've all been waiting
for
all several hundred of
you all
right
now so what we do is
we blow this
up we did get it to work
amazingly so get all my tools
set
and
then adjust the lettering so it's out of
the
way and then select the
layer uh
all
right so I'll have uh the boss will be
walking
in and he's got a little potato shaped
body and the the initial uh the initial
drawing is just the placeholder so I'm
basically just sizing things so I'm
going to resize that a little bit
smaller and show a little bit more room
for his legs so you know he walked
in then morak is going to be sitting at
his
desk and I have not drawn morak in many
years so I'm going to have to remember
how I draw
him I think he had a cape
you're
excited well you should be all right so
I'm going to go in
close on
MC and we'll work on his face and if I'm
happy with
that we'll do the rest now drawing on
the computer is almost like
carving so you so you just sort
of get the general
idea and then you have lots of time to
fix
it morak has ears like a
vampire and he has hair like a
monster now my uh my art director does
the final
art so I just have to get it in the
ballpark as long as she knows what I'm
trying to draw then she just does her
version of
it all
right so that looks like moric
so there's more
de so it's easier to draw when you go in
tight because everything's bigger so
then I draw back to make sure that I've
got
the got everything in this right
place I'll have moreac working on on the
computer because that's what he
does and one of the things that
photoshop does is it let you lets you
draw straight lines really
easily you just indicate where you want
the line to end up and it just puts it
there
all right
so so far he doesn't have uh detail on
his
clothing here he is upside
down so I'll fill in his clothing in his
chair but I'll save my work
aren't you glad you stayed
around maybe
not all right then I like to give some
dimensionality to his
chair and I give him
a
lanyard all right so now we've got
upside
down so how many people we got a 100
people on
locals and let me
see YouTube
355 Rumble
211 do anybody watching
X X is probably bigger
all right let's save
that and we'll do the
boss we go in a little
tighter clean up his head a little bit
here and open up the front cuz that's
where his nose is going to be sticking
out and then I open up the back
all right I think you kind of see it
pretty
well on locals you guys have all seen
this a few times so I give you the uh
spectator
View and if you draw the same characters
for a thousand
years you sort of intuitively know when
the dimensions are off sometimes you
don't know what's
off and you have to experiment a little
bit but doesn't have to be perfect cuz
like I
said my uh our director finishes it
have you noticed that all the men and
all the women in the office wear the
same
clothes now I often give them uh
beverages do you know
why why do I often give them
beverages the answer is twofold
office workers often have a
beverage and number
two it adds some interest to the pose
otherwise they're just standing there
with their hands hanging
down so it's mostly just that
variety but it's a a realistic kind of
variety because it's what people
actually do all right so we give him
some
legs give him a
lanyard and then the boss is the one
who's
talking all right
so I'm going to lose power on my phone
unless I give it a little juice so
here's a little juice for the phone
locals can you feel
that Locus is the only not only text
stream chat
yes
what all right so let me show you the
first
panel so on the first
panel boss is talking the
MC if you if I went in really close
you'd see that it's sort of scratchy
it's not final art
looking yeah look you could use the uh
Rumble feed to see the see the different
angle all right
I just don't have any way to prop my
phone up so it can look
[Music]
down all right so
then
morak okay I got to fix the boss because
he's leading forward too much for no
reason so I'm going to control T
it move it back too far straighten him
up perfecto
all right so since it's the same
characters in the same
situation I'm going to copy that
first
panel I'm going to drop it in the second
panel and adjust their
placement and then I'm going to collapse
the layers because there's no reason for
this to be a separate
layer then I'll adjust
the wording so it's closer to the one
who's going to be
talking
then I'm going to erase MX
face
huh okay you have to have the right
layer
selected so so the reason I'm erasing
Mor's face is because he's going to be
turning
toward the
boss that puts his widows guess you call
the widows
beak it puts
his vampire yours in the
side and he's going to be looking Shifty
and Evil
so give him these Shifty evil
eyes with a little quizzical look cuz
he's testing out an idea that see if he
can get away with
it
right so he's evil but happy
we don't need that line there now the
boss who's listening to this has to have
a reaction
face so his reaction pH will just be
absorbing it taking it in but his other
hand which had been dangling at his
side will now
insecurely insecurely it will be
doubling up looking holding the
cup because he's a little less confident
now that he's being
blackmailed um he's also going to have
some eye reaction
so let's say his eyes are going to be
bigger so but you got to get those
little eyeballs exactly right because
people really notice that
you can really tell if the eyeballs are
not in just the right
place all right so he says or I could
block
you block you not black
you all right save that I'll save each
panel but now the next thing I'm going
to do is do
a closeup
so I'm going to copy his closeup
face and we're going to go
big and we're going to control T and
we're going
to
oops I'm going to go
big so he'll be big in this
panel here's the upside down version for
locals then
by the way if you're having a
Thanksgiving dinner and you have
a 12-year-old
boy in the
family a 12-year-old boy really needs to
see this
because turns out the 12-year-old boy is
really like to know how to draw
Comics all right so
where will his hands
be I'm going to give him Shifty
hands so he'll be rubbing them together
as evil people
do and we'll just move the oops
combine those
layers all
right combine those
layers give them his
lanyard complete his
chair move the wording to the center and
up connect the wording to the character
and that should do
it his hand is too
big all right that should do
it now hey what
happened now the
boss Point your boss
in case I'm just uh giving the studio
people a different view
[Music]
um is anybody still
interested how many of you are
interested in watching how this works if
you started from the beginning you would
learn uh the writing techniques because
I wrote it while people were watching
and more importantly if you just got
here you don't know that the Dilbert
page day calendar is available now you
can buy it in time for Christmas and the
link for it is at dilbert.com it's the
it's the one at the top just click on
the calendar and is the only place you
can get it can't get it at stores can't
get it at Amazon It's Made in
America and so we had to we had to do it
a little differently than normal to make
it in America had to cut down a few of
the middlemen such as Amazon and the
bookstores anyway so then the
boss is going to be
big so when you've got two people
talking and that's going to be basically
the whole
comic which is not unusual by the
way
um you have to play with the Angles and
the size
and the
focus so that it doesn't look like every
picture is the
same they're not that different but they
they don't have to be that different in
order for people's brains to understand
that you did a little extra
work
so there's the boss's
head
and he's a little concerned
because he's getting
blackmailed so his eyebrows will be a
little
concerned it's very hard to draw their
noses because they're
symmetrical or I intend them to
be sometimes more than others
all right we give him some
ears now you'll note that a lot of my
characters look like
this so before I give the boss his
hair he could be Wall-E if he gave him
glasses so basically the boss and Wall-E
are the same character uh only the
stuff like the glasses and the hair are
different so the boss has got this
pointy
here and I don't even need to do that
but it looks weird to me when it's not
colored the reason I don't have to do it
is cuz
my my art director finishes the art so
this is just the first draft
can you even see this I guess you can
kind of see
it the acents that is correct
acents right locals I'm going to oops
sorry about that uh locals I have to
check one message so hold on
[Music]
hold
on all
right have to tell somebody I'm live
streaming so
all
right that should get us in good
shape all right
back they took Li do who soras
what everybody's in a weird mood tonight
weird mood all right let's finish this
up we'll save
it um I make might make him a little bit
smaller so that his coffee
shows so that will be his coffee coffee
holding
arm by the way do do you notice that
I uh burp when I do live streams a lot
so anybody notice that it's it's not
something I do when I'm not live
streaming and I learned when I was doing
Audi
books that people uh who do a lot of
talking do more
burping so it's a function of doing all
the
talking all right so the boss is holding
on to his coffee his dear
coffee and we'll give him his
lanyard and then I give the boss a few
uh lines around his eyes just to show
he's starting to get
worried this is
the boss starts to get a worried
look then
it's a good thing I ordered a second one
of
these so then I'm going to cheat you may
have noticed
this so I'll usually take one panel and
turn it into
a a cityscape so you can tell that
they're in the office so if you're if
you know which one's talking so in other
words this the dialogue makes it obvious
which one of the characters is talking
such as the person who is answering a
question that always makes it a little
bit
obvious then you can move it to an
external
view where you got the cityscape in the
background and it's an external building
now this one I really don't put any work
into
um because this one will be completely
done by my art director so one panel is
easy all I do is give it an outline of a
building against a cityscape so it'll
have lots of detail when it's finished
but that detail will be done by my art
director not by me so all I do is sort
of just
indicate what it looks like and then
she'll add the windows
she is very very good at what she
does I got so
lucky all right
so we going to have the boss looking
worried so I'm going to copy him from
where he was in the earlier one he'll be
in the same
place but he'll be complaining the
animals
no animals wear
clothes and then we'll slip in a Mur
morak
morak
D all right so I'll take one of the MC
um views
I can take that one I
guess because I'm going to modify
it
what collapse a
layer copy open
up
paste you notice this is closer to
programming than it is to Art does
anybody notice
that uh I probably use as many special
characters codes on the keyboard as I do
drawing anything so it's sort of like a
hybrid between computer programming
because there just tons of commands you
have to learn and drawing it's I I would
say it's not similar to
drawing it's a whole different
deal you know what I think I'll turn him
around shall he ever turn around
yes he
shall all right this will be
tough okay I can never figure out how
to 180 him
all right we'll have to go to the
menu
transform flip
horizontal all right now so I flipped it
around
horizontal but I'm still just using it
as a place
older you know what's amazingly bad
about the interface I just have to
complain about this so can you tell the
difference between where I'm pointing
and this do they look the same to you
because one of them will move this and
one of them is the other thing but all
of the edges look like the same and
depending on what angle you're at so
like from this angle
this and this are the same but if I
change the light angle I can maybe
identify the difference it's a terrible
interface each of these should have a a
really distinct top because you're
always moving
around I can't believe this is like the
you know 90th iteration of Photoshop and
nobody figured that out
yet all
right so we're going to gut
MC because we have to redraw him looking
this way we have to fix his hands
because it doesn't make sense that his
hand is out there like that
now so really it's
just sort of
a just sort of a
placeholder all
right so we give him his Widows
Peak we'll give him his
vampire
ears we will fix his vampire years
because they're too big and in the wrong
place keep the size it's all
right
then people always say how long does it
make take to make a
comic well you're kind of
seeing so the reason I'm looking at
around is see how I did
uh Vex eyes every
time so he doesn't have ordinary eyes
they're always always going to be a
little evil
but I get his widows peing the wrong
place so it's in the
way all right now should I have him
Crossing his
arms here now is the hardest thing in
cartooning to
draw a character with crossed
arms it's very
difficult so the the crossed arms to get
him the there's sort of an
illusion in the real world I guess
because if you try to remember what it
look like and then draw your character
with closed
arms it would not look very pretty much
like a real closed arm
situation all
right although I must say I did that
perfectly perfect
execution and the lanyard
and
then
now looking
good all right
but the boss needs to be little more
relaxed than he was when he first
started the
news he's working with it
now so save my
work has Phil been in the strip lately
not too
lately please do
so I'm going to give the a the boss a
little bit more relaxed eyes than prior
panels because he's now digested the
fact
and his mouth will be
more like that
all right then I think I can reuse the
same
art no I have to change the angle too
boring so I'm going to reuse the art in
the last
panel but I'm not going to use it in the
next to last because that'd be too much
so I've got to find a new angle so to
speak
all right so New
Angle would be looking over one of their
shoulders usually
all
right I don't know if that looks like
the back of his
head does that look like the back of
mx's
head
slightly I don't think a z would be
showing get rid of that
all right well it looks a little like
him
but
oops but I think there wouldn't be as
much hair
here that year is
gigantic it's got to go
all
right there we
go there we
go all right
we're rushing to a
conclusion now all I have to do is stick
a boss in here and we're almost
done and I'll use this angle of the boss
who is looking straight on
all right we'll stick him in here and
adjust him a little
bit because he's much smaller than
that right eyes are going to be
different
all
right I almost fall asleep when I'm
drawing
sometimes we give him D eyes
per
normal all
right I think he said when he says
that's an
exception you should have more of
a all
right you need some eyebr
all right in the last
panel morx says you searched for naked
monkeys and the boss
says I don't need
us but I think the boss should be
walking away what do you
think you should be Halfway
Gone
listening all right by the way if you're
new don't
forget dilber calendars available go to
dilbert.com to find the only way you can
buy
it all
right so the boss is going to be walking
away all right
now we'll just carve this
up like we're modeling clay
all
right we're coming to the close
of this
experiment what we've learned is
that the studio doesn't show
this even though it says it
does and that's why you test it
I'm just barely staying
awake all
right those of you who
are just joining we're drawing a dilbur
comic that I wrote right in front of you
when this is done you can go back to the
beginning and see the the writing
process if you're
interested we started with an idea and
turned it into a naughty cartoon it's
not too naughty
though just a little bit just the right
amount except it's mistake he needs to
be holding his
coffee sometimes I change the hand that
he's holding his coffee
but that's an artistic
Choice sometimes you just want it to be
on the side that he's walking
on gets a better view of
it all right
ladies and gentlemen we're getting close
to the Finish
Line it's very
exciting and will indicate he is
walking these are the walking indication
lines
then morak needs a
mouth all right I think that's a comic
let's
see where's that
cursor where oh where there we
are all
right
now
tab that
worked where is that cursor
again there you are
all right here's the full first
draft boss says morak can you uh give me
an update on the network status morak
says I could or I could blackmail you
you know uh I can see all of
your uh web usage the boss is looking
worried he says what are you trying to
say bordex says I'm saying maybe uh you
don't want the world to know about your
web searches for naked
animals and the boss says no animals
have
clothes and bordex says Oregon grinded
monkeys do and the boss says that's an
exception and morc says you searched for
naked
monkeys then the do the boss says I
don't need a status
update so
here you go
locals sorry about this stupid thing in
the
way that's what it looks
like I don't know why there's a
something up
there so so I will send this file over
to my
assistant and then what she will do is
turn that into a finished comic and the
next time I see it will
be next time I see it will be um a
minute before I publish it so I just
check the spelling
basically supposed to be the original
writer of
what all
right
um are you fingers taped oh my fingers
are not taped for those of you who are
coming
late it's actually an official glove but
it's a two finger glove and it's because
your lower two fingers are the ones that
are on the glass when you're drawing so
these are the ones in the bottom so
you're so you don't uh catch on the
glass and get sticky because your hand
would be you know have oils so it's this
actually one of the greatest inventions
ever
I used to make my own out of uh
photographers gloves you know you just
cut the fingers off and was like a a
little silk
glove but no the hand is
fine there I'm sorry John trend of
combine Garfield with HP Lovecraft
okay now it's not about tendon
