good morning everybody
and welcome to another optimistic
highlight of human civilization called
coffee with scott adams probably the
best time you've ever had in your life
and it's coming at you now
sure sure there's stuff in the news
that's scary and annoying but
that's all behind you now
you're here you're safe
you're with friends it's all gonna be
better
and if you'd like to take it up another
notch
and that's the kind of person you are
all you need is a cupper mug or a glass
of tanker tails to style the canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip
here it comes
go
who says the country is more divided
than ever
totally bs
so part of the uh debate that you see on
social media is the country should
divide into separate
you know separate countries because
we're not one country anymore
to which i say
were we ever
were we ever
do you really think things are worse
than they were in the 60s
you know some of it might be just bad
memory or you're too young
if you live through the 60s
this is nothing
america can handle this level of
discontent
easily
it's not even pressing the uh
you know pressing the envelope at all
we are well within
the everything is fine
zone
it just feels like it's different
because if you have a hobby of talking
about the news
as i do
you get all these little nuggets of you
know that are designed
they're designed to get your blood
flowing right
what do they report in the news
the news doesn't report things that are
normal and you know everything's going
fine the only thing the news shows you
is stuff that's going to get your
you know your entire nervous system
excited
so of course you think the world is
falling apart if you follow the news
or you follow social media but it's not
it's not every time i walk outside the
house
everything seems fine
have you tried that experiment
you know you'll be looking at your phone
and you're on twitter you're like ah
are you stupid
stupid democrats stupid republicans ah
you rhinos
and then you put your phone down
and you walk outside
and your neighbor's there watering the
lawn or whatever and the neighbor says
hey
good morning
and you say good morning great day
have a good one
you know maybe you're a republican maybe
your neighbor is a democrat
do you care
nobody cares
you know it can't be more than one
percent of the the country who would
literally want to
divorce
there are things that people say
hyperbolically in the
political context
so
republicans are always talking about an
armed
insurrection against their own
government or having to defend
themselves from their own government
but it's not that serious
it could be i mean it would only take
you know it would take the right trigger
to make it serious but we've never been
close to it
there's nothing happening that's you
know close to that kind of a trigger
if the government said we're going to
confiscate all your firearms
well i have a very different opinion
at that point i'd say okay that's a
problem
that's a problem but we don't have that
take a look at abortion the most
probably the most polarizing issue there
is
and the people who are most hated by the
left
are people who are literally trying to
save the babies
of the left
and the right as well but they were
going to be saved anyway right
the republicans are trying to save the
lives of the children of their enemies
am i right because the republican babies
are largely being born
they're they're less likely to be
aborted obviously there's a lot going on
in in all parties
but it's a weird kind of
yes the the world is falling apart
because republicans really want their
enemies
to have healthy successful babies
that's literally what's happening
now the way they're doing it
is worth discussing
right the way they're doing it is
totally worth discussing and we do and
what what do we end up doing
creating states where everybody can get
what they want
but it's going to take some adjustment
it might take some time for people to
relocate if they care enough
yeah the country was designed where if
we have huge disagreements
the states
can account for that they can give you
enough variety that you can go where you
want you like low taxes
we got that
you like uh high taxes and higher social
services
come to california
you know you like the open borders
live in a border state
you don't like that go to wyoming
a lot less problem there
so
i would like to be the one beacon of
positivity in your day that will be
surrounded with people trying to get
clicks for getting you all excited
and i'll probably get all excited about
some things too
but
i'll try to keep it in perspective
and you can keep me honest
if you see me getting worked up about
something
that won't matter if i walk outdoors
i mean literally just walk out your
front door
there's nothing going on out there
there's no riot in the streets there's
nothing
people are
just sort of minding their own business
for the most part well here's some good
news i think
the nuclear regulatory commission
made news by approving a small nuclear
reactor design i think is specifically
for the company
new scale and you scale is that bill
gates's
investment
is that the one that bill gates is
invested in new scale
versus the other one what's the other
one there's another one that is in the
news all the time
the other one is what
he's invested in one of the big modular
startups for nuclear which one is it
some um terra
is it terrapower
terrapower yeah okay that sounds right
somebody sounds like they know what
they're talking about
um but new scale won't be the only one
that goes through this process it looks
like there are a number of other
uh entities that are also looking for
this kind of approval now somebody said
the other day that nuclear will never
work
because the economics can never work and
nobody has any idea how to fix that
to which i say yes i do
this right here i just read it to you
how they plan to fix the economics
is to get an approved
model of something that you could build
as smaller and modular
and it uses a technology that's unlikely
to melt or impossible to melt down
problem solved
if you've got the government approval
and you've got a modular design where
you can just you know make more of them
after you after you get going i looks
like problem solved to me economics wise
now that's easy to say because we also
thought
that the last versions of nuclear power
plants would cost
what we estimated
and then they all they all ended up
being multiples of what we estimated
but even if that's true
for the modular
it's still going to be way cheaper than
traditional it looks like that's a good
bet
so in 2029 they expect to maybe have
some of these new scale uh
deals up and running
and that's not that far away
imagine
six years or so now
one assumes they'll be delayed right
but let's say it's 10.
let's say they shoot for six
but in 10 years
we're we're knocking off modular
nuclear
power plants like crazy
i feel like we've solved
climate change
and the fact that the climate change
people don't talk about this incessantly
proves that it's not about the climate
right i mean it's also about the climate
what is clear that this is in a purely
political realm
that people imagine is about the climate
because if if people actually thought it
was about the climate
everybody would be all in on nuclear
now here's an interesting thing that
somebody said
as part of this story
somebody in the industry said that the
zeitgeist had changed in the last two
years
so in the last two years
the the common belief in society and in
government was that nuclear had gone
from the worst thing you could do
to well we better do this as quickly as
possible and do more of it
what changed the zeitgeist the zeitgeist
by the way let me define that because
that's one of those
writer words
there's certain words that writers like
to write
and readers don't like to read and
that's one of them
because you know if you're if you're a
good writer you're writing at about the
sixth grade level of comprehension and
that word is sort of college level
uh so zeitgeist just means the way
people are thinking right
so the way people were thinking
for some reason changed in the last two
years what do you think did it
was there anything happening in the last
two years
that would have changed the zeitgeist
yes
yeah yes michael schellenberger for
example
and uh a lot of other people helping
mark schneider me
other people but i do think that
collectively we actually
moved to zeitgeist
it looks like it
because there was nothing else happening
am i right
you know that the startups were crawling
along same as they are now
but what else changed
the only thing i know changed is that
schellenberger got a bigger audience
and made his case so persuasively that
people just heard and said okay we're
just going to go with you now
i think that's what happened
right
because it wasn't like just the
republicans or just the democrats
pretty much society in general just sort
of went to okay
on nuclear from not okay
there's nothing else that changed
yeah bjorn lomborg wrote some books
and
you know that's that's part of the
persuasion as well the big part
oh there's and i see the suggestion that
the russian ukraine thing blew apart
blew apart our old
model of how we were going to get energy
but i would say that's too too recent
i think the zeitgeist changed well
before the ukraine thing blew up
that's my opinion
all right
um
so when we heard about this raid on
mar-a-lago
um i tweeted that i was gonna give my
government 48 hours
to explain itself
and then a weird thing happened a whole
bunch of people who were
artists
mostly writers you've never heard of
flooded my mentions
and
said
some version of this oh cartoon boy
what are you going to do after 48 hours
make a dilbert comic about it
are you going to overthrow the country
are you going to run an insurrection
what are you going to do dilbert guy
after 48 hours
to which my answer is
i will form an opinion
that's all
the only thing i'm promising you
is that i'm going to give them 48 hours
which i feel is a reasonable standard
a reasonable standard you have 48 hours
to tell me what the deal is
if they tell me what the deal is and i'm
satisfied okay
then i'm satisfied
if they don't tell me what the deal is
then i have questions
and a related question would be why
isn't uh trump telling me what the
warrant says
because we've got to ask that we can ask
that question too because they have to
show the warrant to the recipient
right it's only it's only sealed from us
it's sealed from the public but not from
the recipient
the recipient gets a piece of paper that
says
the law says we can check these things
on your premise
so trump knows exactly what the warrant
says but what he wouldn't know
necessarily
is why
right
if it's sealed that's doesn't mean
sealed from the recipient it couldn't be
it couldn't be
am i wrong about that
the warrant says don't reveal the
warrant
are you saying that the recipient knows
but he's not allowed
let's see let's we're getting some
correction here so i'm seeing people on
both platforms telling me i'm wrong
so let's see if we can clarify this
so do me a favor if you're a lawyer by
profession
uh just put that in your comment so i
can favor your comments like lawyer
colon
this is this is what it is
let's see if we work this out right now
um so i'm looking for a lawyer to just
tell me what's true because the most of
us i think are guessing
uh
let's see
trained lawyer
trump can declin well no trump can't
declassify anything because he's not
president
um so it's not you're saying it's not a
normal situation because there's
national security involved
but is there
is there national security involved
levin said he'd have to go to court to
have permission
to release it
is that what levin said did mark levin
said that trump would need court
permission to release it
you're espousing the so when did you
stop beating your wife argument i am i
don't think i am
uh why are we trying to rationalize the
legality of a purely political act
is it
we don't know yet do we i mean it looks
to me it looks
political
uh trump lawyer was shown the warrior
but didn't get a copy
all right
so interesting all right so um i guess
we don't have a
uh
dilbert boy ain't talking so loud
anymore what's that mean
all the people who have failed as
writers are very mad at me have you
noticed that
they're very mad at me and they also are
unaware that i've had
any career beyond making comics it's
very very consistent
they feel like they're like cookie
cutter like artist trolls
you know put something about writer in
your profile and then go after that
dilbert guy
they're the one star customers yeah
um
stop commenting on trolls it's a waste
of time
it gets my attention sometimes
all right so here's uh here's where
we're at
um the 48 hours would be over i think at
four o'clock my time i think that's when
i tweeted it two days ago so by late
afternoon today
uh we will know if
we've been told anything useful
now
i'm not going to accept
that there's a national security element
to this so we can't be told
would you
because this is not like ordinary
situation if you were a normal citizen
i'd say well
national security so yeah
but i believe that whether it's national
security or not they can at the very
least tell us the
domain that they're looking into
couldn't they
i mean couldn't they say for example
it's about january 6 or they could say
it's about
something in the documents there's
something they could say
um
yeah so we'll find out
now
the clock starts at the raid
well yeah i think i think you're right
the clock should start at the rate so
then would the 48 hours be over already
it would be right oh okay
yeah i mean i was thinking 48 hours from
the time i tweeted but it makes more
sense
a lawyer says that being the dilbert guy
is not not an insult
but somehow they make you sound like
uh that minimizes my opinion
i i hate to tell you this but if you
took the average iq of successful
cartoonists
and compared it to the uh the average
it would be a lot higher than you think
a lot of the successful cartoonists are
literally
physicists lawyers
you know
a lot of a lot of them are really
credentialed
you know gary trudeau ivy league
so being being called a
successful cartoonist is sort of a weird
insult isn't it
all right so let's talk about this
criticism from
the democrats who say
do do a fact check me on this too so the
the democrats are saying that rey was
appointed by trump
um they're saying that
um the judge was a republican appointee
the one who signed off on it
right and so they're saying well if
republicans are involved in this
then there must be something to it
to which i say
but republicans were involved in the
russia collusion hoax
were they not
were were there any republicans in the
50 former intel people who signed off on
the laptop
i mean i don't know
but does it seem likely that all 50 of
them were democrats
i assume there were some republicans
and how about january 6 hearings
being managed by two republicans
right what about the lincoln
what are those guys the lincoln log
group or whatever they are
the the ones who are anti-trump
so imagining that
having republicans involved means it's
not a
hit job
that doesn't track at all right
the other the other bad thing here i saw
from somebody who does not have a stem
education
uh
is that occam's razor
meaning the simplest explanation is
usually correct
suggests that the most likely
explanation for what we're seeing with
this mar-a-lago raid
is that the judge
and
also the attorney general
must have seen something that was
damning and important
because it's the best explanation the
the way they're acting
is as if they did know there was
something important that they could find
maybe find
what do you think do you think that the
simplest explanation is it's exactly
what it looks like
they thought there was something
important and they went to look for it
no that is terrible reasoning
this is a logic and reasoning flaw
if you believe that the simplest
explanation is correct
you might be very dumb
do you know what the simplest
explanation is
it's the one you think is correct
it's circular thinking and people people
use it as if it's some kind of magic
bullet to find the truth it's literally
the opposite of that it's a magic bullet
to make sure that you're in circular
thinking and you're not part of the
rational discussion whatsoever
let me prove it
what's the simplest explanation for
the existence of reality
god
am i right the simplest explanation
is god
well what do the atheists say
no the simplest explanation according to
the atheist is just evolution change
over time
explains everything
and then they say well
how do you explain how it all got here
and then the atheists say how do you
explain how god got here we're equal
the point is i'm not arguing whether
god or evolution is true or not true
what i'm arguing is that no matter what
you think is true
you also think is the simplest
explanation
occam's razor doesn't tell you what's
true
you start with what you believe is true
and then you reason backwards to say
it's also the simplest
it's so simple it's the simplest
anytime you see somebody using occam's
razor to argue
especially in these situations where
there's lots of variables and there's
lots of unknowns and still the fog of
war if anybody's using occam's razor
in a world in which the unlikely thing
almost happens all the time
right
if you told me so here's the problem
with outcomes razor
when you saw the russia collusion
thing
spinning up
wasn't the simplest explanation that
there might be something there
and it turns out the simplest
explanation was
democrats are corrupt
that's pretty simple too
everything looks simple
if it's the thing you think is true
so don't be confused by what looks like
the simplest
explanation that means nothing has no
predictive value whatsoever it's
completely subjective on your part
all right
in science that might have some use
though because science is more
bounded and if you have fewer variables
to explain something in science
that's good
so science is still useful but not in
the real world
um
i reiterate the most dangerous question
in the world
for democrats
if you're a democrat and you believe
trump is a menace to society
unlike normal politicians and this is
the important part
you know everybody calls the politicians
on the other side a menace to society
but trump has been singled out as like a
special
you know menace who could end
civilization itself
and if you believe that to be true
wouldn't you falsify a
an arrest warrant to stop him
and if you wouldn't
what the is wrong with you
let me say it again
if you believe the gaslighting and that
trump is like the really a risk to end
civilization itself
if you believe that meaning that you
believe what democrats largely say in
public
if you believe that and you did not
break the law to stop him
you worthless piece of
if you believed it was true
because if you put me in that position i
would break the law
i would break the law so fast
there's no law i wouldn't break to kill
hitler because you know murders against
the law
i would murder hitler if i had a choice
or a chance if i had a chance on murder
even knowing i would get killed
i'd still murder him
so it doesn't matter if it's against the
law of course i do it so are you telling
me that a sitting judge
let's say the judge is a patriot
cares about the country
but also believes that trump is hitler
you're telling me that judge
is going to put the law over the country
maybe
but if there's a if there's a judge that
puts the law
over the survival of the country
you need to get rid of that judge right
away
i want the judge that would break the
law
in that specific situation
i want the head of the
fbi
to violate the law totally
under that specific situation that
you're stopping a hitler from coming to
office
any other situation they better follow
the law because that's best for
everybody but in that specific situation
you really have to kill hailer
now i'm not suggesting that they do that
of course i'm telling you that
they need to explain why they're not
doing it
because to me the simplest explanation
for everything we're seeing is that
trump is being framed
in every way that they can figure out to
frame him
so if you think that because some people
were republicans
or they were
upright citizens
until this moment
you have to explain to me
why you wouldn't kill hitler if you had
a shot
if you can't explain that to me you're
not part of the conversation
you should not have a ticket to the
conversation if you're not willing to
answer this question because i can
answer it
i can answer all of the tough questions
right
sometimes you have to say yeah people
are going to die
but i still choose it
that would be an honest answer right
like going to mars
is going to mars a good idea
well people are going to die
they're definitely going to die because
it's a risky proposition over the long
haul
and even even musk says that yeah people
are going to die
trying to
occupy mars
but it's the only way we're going to get
there like you can't really stop at all
it's going to happen
so
i feel like anybody who can't honestly
say what they believe and what they
would do to be consistent with that
belief should just not be in the
conversation just ignore them
here's some context that apparently
democrats are not aware of based on
social media
reading this morning
i don't believe
that democrats remember the hunter biden
laptop thing was a disappeared story
i don't feel they know that
i feel it's just something that they
didn't know about
and then maybe lately they heard about
so they're missing the entire fact that
the government is proven
to have plotted to frame republicans or
plotted to keep a republican out of
office
because the whole reason for
the 50 past intel people signing off the
hunters by hunter biden's laptop was
russian disinformation was to change the
nature of politics to change the result
to me that looks like an insurrection
if you get 50 past intelligence people
to
lie and i think they knew they were
lying don't know that but i think they
did
if you get them
50 of them to lie
that is an insurrection if it changes
politics
so you've got this january 6 committee
looking into the wrong insurrection
there was an actual proven one
with 50 people who have the types of
jobs where they shouldn't be lying to
the public but they did
now
what do you make of these 50 people
what i make is that they probably
believed that trump was a
threat to civilization
i don't think that those 50 people were
just acting out of
just politics
i think they actually believed they were
saving the world by keeping trump out of
office so here we have an actual
insurrection in my opinion this is a
clear
proven insurrection because the 50
people could not have known it was
russian disinformation but they signed
on to say that they didn't know that
that they did know that and they didn't
so we don't have to wonder if the top
level of government would plot against
trump
it's right there
and then of course russia collusion
have you ever talked to a democrat about
the russia collusion hoax
do you know what they all say
they all say it was proven to be true
because paul manafort went to jail
they actually say it was true
as if that was the point of it
or as if paul manafort is sharing some
internal polling information with a
russian guy which he shouldn't have done
i'm not not defending it
but like that mattered
that didn't matter
he shouldn't have done it but it didn't
hurt the country to have some internal
polling from the trump campaign
i don't imagine there were any surprises
in it
right
yeah and
apparently the judge who signed off had
some
he had represented epstein as his lawyer
that's that's a little sketchy
let me ask you this
if you represented epstein as his lawyer
what is the likelihood that you could be
blackmailed
it's close to 100 isn't it
just think about it who takes the job of
being epstein's lawyer
would you take the job of being
epstein's lawyer if you had not been to
the island
maybe you have to be someone who hasn't
been to the island but something tells
me
that just defending him suggests
that you are blackmailable
am i right
if you said who's the most blackmailable
judge in the whole world i'd say well
somebody who had had a close association
with epstein is right in the middle of
the the blackmail
black hole of the universe
because i think we all assume that
epstein was running a blackmail
operation
right i mean he certainly was getting
lots of important people in compromising
situations and i don't think that was an
accident
so if you believe
uh if you believe that
a judge or a lawyer associated with
epstein
being on epstein's side
makes him an easy target for blackmail
then you should not trust that judge
so i don't
so i don't assume that even if it was a
republican appointment
it doesn't matter if it's a republican
appointment
you know
um
yeah the far thing
uh well it's boring right
and i also add to my list that the fbi
for all practical purposes they did
confess
to instigating the january 6
protest
now the reason i say that
is that when
ted cruz asked the representative of the
fbi
to answer the question
did the fbi instigate it they decided to
refuse to answer
uh you're welcome
so
would you sign on to that opinion would
you agree with me if the fbi refuses to
answer the question
did you instigate the protests that's
that has to be assumed to be a
confession
right
because
yeah i mean that's a confession so if
they instigated the biggest um
or at least they're indicating they you
know i don't know
but they've clearly indicated they
reconnect
hey did i disappear there for a moment
was it something i said
was this something i said
interesting when that happens
so let me say it again
see if we can crash youtube again
a reasonable citizen has to assume that
the fbi confessed to instigating january
6
because they did not
deny it
now
if they had like assets there i think it
would have been easy for them to say
we don't tell you where all of our
assets are
you know but we do monitor any groups we
think would be dangerous but we don't
instigate or we did not instigate
anything in this case
you know then they'd have to explain the
whitmer situation
where the fbi did instigate something
and that's been proven apparently
but they could always deny it
it doesn't give away anything they could
just say no we didn't instigate it
period
do you have assets in every group yes
you would want us to
but we didn't instigate it
just say you didn't do it
if you can't and by the way they have
never followed up to say they didn't do
it there's been no follow-up as in well
we probably should have said more
assertively
we had nothing to do with instigating
but they didn't
and given their um
past performance that's actually pretty
recent
you would have to assume guilt
so let me be as clear as i can i don't
know if the fbi is framing trump with
this raid
but you have to assume so
because the the burden of
uh of proof is clearly on the government
this point because
they have proven themselves to be
non-credible
if you prove yourself to be non-credible
on this exact question
you need to
you need to step up or you have to live
with the fact that we're not going to
buy your story
you have to choose one
and i think i think it pretty much
guarantees um trump's re-election
there's a story about the fbi spent
hours going through melania's wardrobe
that's the sort of thing i wouldn't have
expected since j edgar hoover's day
i think j edgar hoover
if the stories are true
would have spent more than a few hours
in melania's closet
until he tried on every dress
allegedly
allegedly
not that there's anything wrong with
that
we love our lgbtq
plus community
um
and is it true that the judge who signed
that search warrant also recently
recused himself
on a case that involves clinton and
trump
really
is that even true
i'm seeing it on
social media but but this one just needs
it really doesn't it let me just say it
again and then you can all you can all
just say
really
at home
this same judge
who we're all trusting to be
you know even-handed and above
politics
recused himself not that long ago on a
unrelated case that involved clinton and
trump
really
really that's the guy who signed the
warrant
that's like the last guy who should sign
the warrant
all right
um
so um
see what else is happening
there's this uh congress person named
perry
who he said that he was traveling on
tuesday and that uh and you should know
that he's
also uh he's filed articles of
impeachment against garland
right so a person in congress a
republican
he files articles of impeachment against
garland
and as soon after the fbi stopped him
and seized his phone
without warning
now
he says all he had to do was ask with a
warrant
but all he had to do was ask and he
would just give him the phone
if there was a warrant
but instead they stopped him and his
family and took his phone from him
now i have a question
how much information is on the phone
that's not in the icloud or
in the internet
is there much
there is some right there's some
messages that are maybe only on your
phone
is that a thing
well icloud is encrypted but can't law
enforcement get it
so text messages would not be stored
anywhere but the phone right
so it'd be the text messages only
because email you can get to i'm just
wondering if we should allow law
enforcement to seize phones
here's what i would suggest
somebody make an app
somebody make an app that stores all of
your text messages in your icloud
if it doesn't already happen right
so that 100 of the things on your phone
including your text messages are in the
cloud
and then when the fbi comes for you
there should be a law that says oh check
my phone and you can see that i have the
app active this stores everything in the
cloud
so instead of giving you my phone i'm
going to give you the password for the
cloud
but it'll be a limited password that
only works for like one day or something
so they can get everything they want
but you won't take my phone
so i won't lose my phone
because
i think the law about they can take your
phone was before phones became essential
to navigate modern life
what would you do if your phone went
away
if somebody took my phone i don't know
what the hell i'd do
i i guess i'd figure it out but
somebody says this is the dumbest thing
i've ever said that's not true i've said
much dumber things
you don't get to negotiate with law
enforcement i'm
i'm saying that the law should be
changed
and by the way yes you do get to
negotiate with law enforcement
take it from me
i'm an adult white male i definitely
negotiate with law enforcement
maybe you can't
you know maybe if you're black and male
maybe you can't i don't know i've never
been in that situation but i can totally
negotiate with law enforcement you think
that's not a thing
you don't think law enforcement would be
more afraid of me than i am of them
they would be
i could tell you from personal
experience
when i talk to law enforcement they're
worried about their jobs
and should be
it should be
all right
not the fbi you say you can't negotiate
with the fbi you can negotiate with
anybody
you can negotiate with anybody
they just have to be afraid of you if
they're not afraid of you you can't
negotiate with them i don't mean
physically
they have to think that you're going to
be more trouble
than it's worth
if they don't talk to you
that's all just make sure that they know
that talking to you is easy
not talking to you could be a problem
they'll talk everybody wants the path of
least resistance
it doesn't mean you'll get what you want
but you can definitely negotiate
so
what do you think of this
so how many are how many examples now do
we have of republicans being targeted
and hunted
too many
and you're saying don't say a thing to
them i think it depends who you are
if you're me
um i think you would talk to them
i'm not sure everybody would
is scott concerned
um concerned about having my phone taken
yes
yeah i will put odds on it at this point
if i had to say the odds that i will be
subject to an intelligence investigation
no i'm gonna
i already am
i'm sure of it
you don't think that the intelligence
agencies
have crawled all over my
my stuff
i'd be amazed if they haven't
and the reason is because i can move the
needle
right
it or they might think so if they
believe that i can
move the needle
they're all over me
and
they would certainly want to know if
anybody is paying me
or if there's any foreign entity
influencing me
and not only would u.s intelligence
agencies want to know that about me
specifically
but they'd also want to know that other
other countries would want to know that
about me
right
and if they don't they're not doing
their job
if you saw that there was somebody
talking about politics who seemed to be
actually changing it
and you didn't know and he wasn't
registered democrat wasn't registered as
a republican didn't work for a major
news organization seemed to be
independent
if you were the cia wouldn't you need to
know more about that situation if you're
doing your job
right
you'd want to know more about that
situation yeah tim poole same situation
mike cerdovich just to throw out some
other names there are people who don't
take a paycheck
from a big you know known entity
who are absolutely capable of moving the
conversation
there's there's no way that the
intelligence people don't need to know
as much about those people as possible
just to figure out if somebody's
influencing the influencer they would
have to know that that would be very
important
um
all right does anybody disagree
you think you have actual power i've got
news for you lol
i don't know was that for me
scott's too useful to the deep state to
be canceled that's probably true
that's probably true i'm too useful to
the deep state because i'm useful to the
country
if you've noticed the one thing i don't
do
at least not intentionally
is i don't promote conspiracy theories
that republicans love
generally
in fact i'm usually the last person to
get on board even after the court has
proven it's a conspiracy theory
russia collusion being an example
although i never i never expected that
to be proven but i was kind of waiting
waiting to see if they had
anything um
uh the local yes it is
civil servants living yeah
adrenochrome i don't know what that
reference is
you promoted masks no i didn't uh
jonathan will now be banned for life for
saying that i promoted masks jonathan
you
miserable piece of
that never happened i've always been
anti-mask
i'll hide you in this channel
you're gone forever
i remind you
that criticisms about what i've actually
said or done are very much allowed
right you are allowed to criticize me as
much as you want for something i
actually did
but don't make up
like don't don't start with a lie and
then act like you're defending it
uh
uh
how soon until china starts blocking to
taiwan i don't expect it
you know china's best play with with
taiwan is
keep everything the way it is
which is actually everybody's best
interest
because in the long long long run taiwan
will be part of china in in in a more
way more ways than it already is there's
no way it can go any other way
so
you don't need a war over it
you know it would be a war over
something you were going to win anyway
it didn't make that much difference
somebody says i'm confused because you
argued that mass create friction
all right let's see if let's see if you
can understand this
um
how is it how is that
i'm not even sure i know why that's hard
to understand so there's an engineering
statement
that masks cause friction
and then there's a what do you do about
it statement that's completely different
so i'm not going to argue mass because
you're all bored about that but if you
believe that i promoted masks when 100
of what i said is no masks no mandates
then you
you know
just don't comment on me if you're going
to change my opinion to the opposite of
my opinion and then come here and
confuse people about it just go away
if you can't handle
the fact that something could have an
engineering truth
but not be good enough to be worthy of
implementing that's not hard
it's not hard to understand that
something might work a little bit
but not enough to be worth doing for
other reasons
that those are not incompatible
thoughts
um if you're saying i argue that they're
effective
that's a little bit more than i did
i argue that the logic of them
guarantees that they would have to be
based on what we knew
and that assumed that plume theory was
correct
but if the plume theory was incorrect
then they would have no value i would
agree
um
do you think intelligence agencies are
soft on dems obviously yes
um
all right
somebody says you valued and pushed the
mask nope
did not
and i would ask you
um
boo dog i would ask you to
unsubscribe from locals because really i
can't tolerate that
i really can't i did not value and push
masks that literally didn't happen
so i would ask you to leave locals
really i don't want you on the platform
seriously
please
please unsubscribe
all right if
you can do anything except stop start
false rumors about me in public
that's all
you just can't do that
everything else is fine you just can't
do that okay
uh
you did say they worked
okay
are you still confused
still confused
um
all right uh
dr michael savage i don't know what
you're referring to specifically
seems like uh gaslighting now you
promoted cannabis
did i
yeah we're not going to talk about mass
anymore let's talk about anything else
all right
those are good rumors keep starting
those
all right i don't have anything else
useful to say so i think i'm gonna
go on um
why did i say i would talk to them what
do you mean
uh
why did you say you would talk to them
to the fbi
why wouldn't i
i don't understand the question
yes
so
so a number of you have an accurate
summation of my opinion and i see it
over on locals people are explaining it
better than i was explaining
coffee mug yeah
i need to uh
follow up on the coffee mug
all right
um
and then i'm going to do some
interview tests we'll do that later
have a coffee mug
why should you talk to the fbi i don't
get that
question
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
bye for now
