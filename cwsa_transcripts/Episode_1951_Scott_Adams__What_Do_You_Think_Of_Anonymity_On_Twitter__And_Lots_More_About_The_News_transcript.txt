[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams the
finest thing that's ever happened to you
and would you like to take your
experience into levels that only
Ayahuasca has ever experienced
yes you would and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chalice
or Stein that canteen jogger flaska a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
um
yeah yeah
everything looks better
now before I turn off my other monitor
that is lighting me poorly
just before I came on I noticed that
there's a company
that uses AI
to pull the best parts of your podcast
out of your video and it automatically
makes a clip that you can share on
social media
does that blow your mind
so in theory I can run this program
against this podcast somehow it can look
maybe on YouTube or something somehow it
can tell where people care the most or
they're commenting the most and that it
assumes that must be the good part and
it'll pick that good part out put
subtitles on it like it's just a
complete yeah it's called Uh
you were close it's called video
I'll spell it here dot a i v i d y o
dot Ai and I'm not recommending it I
only just saw an ad for it that's all
I've seen
but that's that's pretty wild isn't it
you know I didn't want to do a bunch of
Clips because they're kind of time
consuming but if I can do them
automatically kind of cool
well good news WNBA player Brittany
Greiner was released from a Russian
penal colony in exchange for a Russian
arms dealer
and I think Russia also got a
the first draft pick
so not only did Russia get their arms
dealer back but they get the first round
pick for the next arms dealer
so the next arms dealer draft
first pick late no so that should be
good for their performance in the coming
Wars
um
I I'm waiting for this to happen but it
doesn't seem to have happened yet
is there going to be a point where Black
America turns Brittany Greiner into a
hero has that happened
is Brittany Greiner seen as a hero to
Black Americans
because you know there's sort of a trend
that's sub-optimal
and the trend is
can we please have some role models who
did not just break a law
now I don't think she should have been
in the penal colony you know what what
happened to her was obviously a tragedy
and completely unfair
but
we got to be careful
let's maybe Elevate Heroes who haven't
not recently broken any laws that would
be cool
that would be cool
okay
I think I said this before but sometimes
what I like things I just say them twice
uh I I keep thinking back about the
Meltdown of the crypto exchange FDX
and how many people celebrities and rich
people had believed that they were real
before they melted down
and one of them was Kevin O'Leary who
was famous for being on Shark Tank and I
swear to God just before this FTX thing
melted down
I was looking at Kevin Leary O'Leary
stuff on social media
because he's very interesting and I was
thinking to myself
I was actually feeling a little bit
jealous
and the jealousy specifically was
how does this one guy
keep making all the right choices like
Investments like what does he know that
I don't know
right is there something some some extra
facility does he have an extra speed
just something he can do that I can't do
but knowing that he lost millions of
dollars and was even a paid spokesperson
for the FDX uh thing
I really feel like I would not have
fallen for that
like I don't know
you know somebody offered me to be a
spokesperson I don't know maybe I would
have said yes if it was a big paycheck
or something but I'm feeling a little
Superior
now I'm not saying for sure that I could
have outperformed Kevin O'Leary on this
investment I don't know that
but
am I wrong that it feels good
when people who look like they're
you know almost Godlike in their
abilities do something as ordinary as
that
like that's just an ordinary mistake
it's very
I I honestly find it motivating
in a weird way the reason I found it
motivating
is to know that no matter what level you
are successful
you you're still ordinary you're just
still an ordinary person who can make
ordinary mistakes so to me it makes
success seem more approachable
I've said the same thing about people
who meet famous people
there are two of my co-workers
who were in cubicles next to me
when I got famous doing uh Dilbert and I
was a published author at the time
and so my co-workers got to see me go
from you know guy in a cubicle who was
doing no better than they were to
something that looked like more
successful
soon after
two of the people who were you know
actually adjacent cubicles at one point
also wrote and published their own books
now I'm positive
that they they took that challenge on
both of them they were both successful
because they saw that I'm an ordinary
person and I did it
and that and I think just hanging around
me and saying okay he's not really
special
if he can write a book
I could probably write a book too and so
they wrote books and they both got
published and they both got paid
so it was absolutely true
they said there's nothing that special
about you Scott I can do that too and
then they actually did it
they literally just did it they just did
what I did and it worked now I'm
positive that having that kind of
association with somebody you think is
special
but then you find out how you know
ordinary they are I'm positive that that
helps you succeed I'm positive
because because how could you not think
well maybe I can do it too this person
is looking pretty ordinary
all right
um inflation might be coming down
according to Constance Hunter
um on a tweet apparently used car prices
are falling fairly rapidly I assume that
has to do everything to do with the
supply chain
and because there have been waves of
layoffs
we expect that maybe salaries will not
be increasing as much as before
gases gas is starting to come down
so if we get
automobiles we're only talking used ones
but probably applies to new ones if we
can get automobiles gas
and paychecks not increasing quickly
you'd you'd be in much better shape but
I think there's something bigger
happening
in my opinion one of the things that
makes America
at least so far unbeatable
is that we have self-correcting systems
that self-correct
I'm not sure that other systems are as
flexible to let their systems self-heal
so let me give you an example
as I just said inflation seems to be
correcting like that's just our economic
system our transportation system for
goods was broken
but that breaking revealed all of its
weaknesses and now I think it's being
re-engineered from the ground up
software AI all kinds of different
things are happening so our our Delivery
Systems are being re-engineered our
manufacturing this being completely
revamped you know we're moving it out of
China we're adding you know 3D printers
and stuff completely the self-healing
system
and
there's a lot of other stuff like
Twitter is Twitter is healing at the
moment wouldn't you say
um I would say that our election systems
are poor
but a lot of a lot of work has been done
in the last few years to try to shore
things up and get more witnesses and
stuff like that so I don't think our
election system is where it needs to be
but it's definitely in the process of
self-correcting
it's in the process I think our nuclear
energy industry is self-corrected it
went from a negative thing to probably
the only thing that will save us I see
ESG that got a little wild but it looks
like it's being pulled back ESG is
self-correcting
um
and probably there are probably a number
of other things you could you could
mention
same kind of thing now
what do you think of that hypothesis do
you think that China can self-correct as
quickly as the United States can
like all of our systems have that
quality that we're willing to shoot our
own babies
I think that that might be uniquely
Americans that we're willing to execute
our own babies to build a better baby
and we'll do it tomorrow like we're not
going to hesitate
so I feel like that's almost a permanent
Advantage we have
now I would also say that wherever you
thought America was relative to all the
other countries prior to the pandemic
I believe that we've pulled away
would you agree with that whatever you
think of America at the moment I believe
we pulled away from all the other
countries I think we're by far the
strongest country now I think I think
China and Russia are kind of
kind of struggling a little bit
so I'm not saying we're perfect we still
certainly have our problems
but I feel like we did pull away
and that being the best of the group has
its advantages we might see some really
long-term advantages coming out of you
know the tragedy of the
of the of the pandemic
um
that's what I think
so tech companies are downsizing as you
know a lot of big companies announced
big layoffs and I saw on
Machiavelli's underbelly account
that apparently California tech
companies
are hiring a
Consultants from the outside to do Dei
adverse impact analysis
in other words to make sure that when
they do their layoffs that is not
hurting one
demographic group unfairly you know that
nobody's being targeted
so that'll work pretty well right
what could go wrong
do you see any any way that that could
cause any unintended
side effects of any kind
now correct me if I'm wrong they have
painted themselves in the corner in
which they have two choices
and tell me if I'm wrong
right because I might be wrong
maybe there's some other choice
they either
fire people you know
based on business needs
which almost certainly almost certainly
would look unfair to somebody
would you agree I don't know who it
would look unfair to exactly but if you
just did it based on what the business
needs it's going to be a semi-random
process that surely will affect some
people more than others with no
intention to do that wouldn't you agree
so if they did if they ignore the
diversity thing they're going to create
a problem
and they'll come back and bite them in
the ass but suppose they go the other
way and they follow the Consultants
um
the consultant recommendations of how to
fire people in a let's say a
demographically fair way according to
them
doesn't that guarantee they have to fire
their best employees
I'm not wrong about that right
have they not created a system
the tech companies themselves have they
not created their own system that
guarantees that the very next thing they
have to do is fire their better
employees to make sure that you've got
some equality now when I say better
that's not a racial comment
let me clarify
for historical reasons which we could
debate
there are fewer minorities in Tech
so I'm only making a math argument I'm
not talking about the quality of any
people I'm not talking about anybody's
potential you're not talking about
anybody's genetic makeup it's nothing
about that it's just math
you know the math is
that if you need to get rid of a lot of
people
you're probably going to have to start
getting rid of some qualified people
to make sure your diversity works out
because you can't really have two top
priorities
right you could have a top priority to
have good profits or you could have a
top priority to make sure your diversity
is managed in a socially correct way but
you can't do both you can't do both
so that's that's the choice I'll have to
make now I suppose they're just covering
their butts by having an outside service
bless whatever they decide to do
if that's all they're doing well that
makes sense
it
uh notice that he doesn't dare mention
IQ I'm going to take this challenge
so over on the locals platform
this is a criticism or to commenting me
Scott's trying to couch this at language
other than qualifications notice that he
doesn't dare mention IQ or who would
have to explain why the Asians have the
most white privilege
does IQ have anything to do with this
topic
it does not
it does not
no you think it does but it doesn't
because the people have already been
hired right
their IQs You could argue made a
difference before
you you could argue that had something
to do with how they got the job in the
first place
but once they're there
it's no longer a consideration because
they've been working right if somebody
got hired with an IQ of 70 but they were
the best employee in the company
who cares
I mean obviously that wouldn't happen
but who cares right so their IQ becomes
effectively a zero consideration
as soon as they've performed would you
agree with that that at the time you're
getting rid of them IQ is no longer any
kind of a variable
now I will go further
so so what you're arguing is that
something on the front end
you know according to your racist view
of things your racist view is that
that's what's causing a lower percentage
of certain people in some categories
but it's unrelated to what they do when
they're downsizing in my opinion
unrelated
um
and by the way
um let me say this in case you haven't
heard it before
there are many Geniuses who are white
but I don't get credit for that
you get that right
the fact that other people who have
similar
melanin the two I do if they got a Nobel
Prize they don't share that with me
because I'm white
so the fact that other white people have
high IQs I know this is a surprise has
no impact on my IQ
not at all it doesn't affect It event so
it doesn't matter if groups have
different IQs
because I'm not a group
and you're not a group
so I mean obviously differences can
explain some you know General
differences in society
of course again
all right but it doesn't help you it's
not about you it's just an interesting
statistic
Senator Tom Cotton continues to be
awesome
I guess the CEO of Kroger was talking to
Congress recently last week and trying
to give support to do a merger and I
guess the Democrats are concerned about
them having too much power Kroger wants
to merge with Albertsons I think
and
Tom Cotton said to the CEO of Kroger
quote
I've cautioned them for years that if
they silence conservatives and
center-right voters if they discriminate
against them in their company
they probably shouldn't come and ask
Republican Senators to carry water for
them whenever our Democratic friends
want to regulate them or block their
mergers
he continued and then he finished with
this I'll say this I'm sorry that's
happening to you best of luck
oh that was so based best of luck
yeah you've been you've been our
people
every day you know our people would be
Republicans in in his way of saying
things you've been your people
every day and then you're coming and
asking us for a favor
good luck with that
hey good luck I wish you well
now I think the specific
thing was that some I guess some Kroger
employees were fired because they were
unwilling to wear a an apron there was
some pro-lgbtq message
so I think that's what he was he was
basing his comments on
um I would like to once again praise CNN
can you handle it
CNN did something there that just
requires a compliment I know I know you
hate it I hate it but but I feel like I
can't be an honest broker
unless I unless I call the balls and
Strikes the way I see them
here's something that CNN did
they ran a story about a quote a Florida
lawmaker who was accused of misusing
covid relief funds
and that's that's how they presented it
a Florida lawmaker who is accused of
misusing coveted relief frauds do you
see it
do you see why I want to compliment them
it was a Republican
it was a Republican
yeah you thought I was gonna you thought
that they were hiding you thought they
were hiding the party affiliation
because it was a Democrat nope
nope
they actually told the story straight
they told the story about an individual
who did something bad and then later in
the Bobby of the story they identified
him as Republican
perfect
perfect
what did the other Publications do
Republican accused of stealing money
right that's what the other Publications
did Republican
who once I think he was also
he was behind the don't say gay
thing
right now correcting the frog is that
not worth a compliment
was that not worth a compliment
you tell me
no somebody says no
well I would like to encourage what I
would like to see more of
and I like that they told me what his
party was but I like that that wasn't
the lead
because that that made it a human
interest story about a crowd and I think
that's what it was I don't believe that
his Republican credentials are what
caused him to do a crime
it was actually the Lesser important
part
all right nobody likes it when I
compliment CNN noted
all right
let's talk about Dr Jordan Peterson
who's
um talking about the downside of
anonymous Twitter users
now here's what I learned
whenever you introduce a new topic let's
say new-ish
yeah because it's not brand new but one
that has not been completely
you know struggled over for years
because on most topics everybody has a
hardened opinion and it's not going to
change but when you have some kind of a
you know a newish kind of a thing and
the question is should we have Anonymous
should Anonymous accounts be on Twitter
and should you be able to block them Etc
um
and the quality of people's comments
when I tweeted about it was insanely bad
it's amazing to watch if if people have
not been assigned their opinions yet
so watch them try to come up with their
an opinion independently it was like a
sad and
it's an awful thing number one
a lot of people said I asked the
question so I tweeted and I asked the
question what did Anonymous Twitter
users have they ever solved the problem
so so my my tweet was
have any Anonymous Twitter users ever
solved a problem
that maybe would not have been solved
otherwise
and what did people say
they said well it's a good thing we had
Anonymous people
um doing XYZ
which had nothing to do with Twitter
now do you all get
the being anonymous in a completely
different context has nothing to do with
this
right there's no argument that says in a
completely different domain anonymity is
either good or bad
you get that that has nothing to do with
the Twitter conversation it just reminds
you of it so be careful of things that
just remind you of the topic
right the fact that other people talk
about anonymity in a completely
different context is just something
you're reminded of that's not part of
your argument your argument is about
Twitter specifically
and that's it if you can't make the
argument about Twitter specifically it
doesn't matter what somebody else did
that's telling you nothing and now
if your example about something else
brought up an important point that would
also be valid in this domain of Twitter
anonymity then that's good
but I didn't see anybody do that I just
people said well it's good in a
completely different way
so therefore it's good on Twitter that's
not an argument
that's actually a nothing
that's like noise there's no logical
thread there
at all and and to see how many people
went that route
was just like distressing
like you really can't tell
that arguing a completely different
topic doesn't help like there are a lot
of people who can't tell the difference
between staying on the topic and arguing
a completely different one like that
would help
I know it's weird
but don't do that don't do that
the second thing that happened is if you
ask a question on Twitter
people assume that they have heard your
opinion
that didn't happen I asked a question
because I don't have a fully formed
opinion
I would like to see some examples of
where anonymity helped Twitter
I'm not saying they don't exist
I didn't say that I said can you give me
some examples because if I had some
examples I could say oh yeah that's a
good example where anonymity helped the
world
and then I would say okay those are some
good examples I'll weigh that against
whatever cost it is and they'll have the
costs and the benefits
but people said you bastard you
why do you hate anonymity
to which I say uh
where did that come from
and then there were other people who had
to explain to me
why anonymity is good for the anonymous
people
did I did you think I was confused about
that
did anybody need to mansplain to me why
anonymity is sometimes chosen by people
isn't that literally known by a hundred
percent of all people I believe babies
are born with that knowledge
like why why are you why are you
explaining that to me
and people thought that that helped let
me explain
why people would not like to lose their
jobs over their opinion now I get that I
get that that's why I put it in my tweet
I literally said I understand why people
want anonymity and what did people tweet
to me
Scott let me explain to you why people
want anonymity
that's my usual experience on the social
media
all right
um
let me offer one useful suggestion
Maybe
because I feel as though we're limiting
ourselves in the prison of two ideas to
quote a Greg guffheld point the prison
of two ideas I don't think Anonymous or
not anonymous
is the right question because there
might be another category and here's
what I mean
if I see somebody who's completely
Anonymous and their profile has no
picture of anything and no bio profile
information that's what I call like
totally anonymous
those Anonymous people
I I'd like to get rid of from my
experience
there are other Anonymous people who
identify as medical doctors
and but I don't know who they are in
real life
very useful
I love
hearing an anonymous medical doctor
give a specially contrarian views very
useful an anonymous engineer
very useful love it an anonymous lawyer
love it yeah when somebody says I I'm a
lawyer and here's my opinion yes please
please give me Anonymous legal opinions
from people who are actually lawyers now
of course there's some question about
whether they're really lawyers right but
usually you can tell right I don't see
imposters doing it really
so I would like some kind of a middle
middle ground between Anonymous and not
anonymous because if you say you're a
doctor
you have given a little bit of a clue to
your
identity right and some people could
piece together enough Clues and maybe
figure out that you are this person they
suspected
so so it's not risk-free
to say what your job is or to say what
your education level is
but here's the main point
um and I I won't back down from the
following statement because it's
universally understood to be true
all communication
depends on an assumption that the
listener makes about the speaker's
intentions
correct I need all of you to agree with
this before we go on
all communication depends
for you to hear it correctly you have to
have an assumption about the speaker
right if you assume the speaker is your
enemy
that you're probably going to say it's a
lie
if you think the speaker is a
salesperson
you're probably going to think it's at
least hyperbole
if the person is your best friend that
you know has your good you know your
good
what's best for you in mind then you
think it might be wrong or it might be
right but at least it's well intentioned
right a hundred percent of how you
process something goes through the
filter of who is talking
now what happens when the talk of the
speaker is anonymous
here's what people get wrong
you think you can evaluate an anonymous
comment
you can't
you can't
it's just blah blah blah an anonymous
comment
is blah blah blah because if you don't
know who it's coming from you can't
assume any intention and therefore
there's nothing but noise
it's literally pollution
okay it's just pollution
so that's that I and have you heard
anybody make that point that if you
don't know who's speaking you can't
understand what they said
as anybody said that I've not heard
anybody say that and to me that's
probably the most important point
so here's here's what I'd like to say
I'd like to see an option that I could
Mass limit
uh completely Anonymous accounts
or if I wanted
to limit people who are semi-anonymous
meaning they've told you something about
their credentials
but that's all you know you just know
their credentials
so I'd like to know if I'm talking to a
student
and I'd like to know if I'm talking to a
professional
because I would react completely
differently depending who I'm talking to
right now it would have to be optional
so you would have to be able to choose
whether you gave up any credential
information or not but I would like to
be able to choose whether I have access
I I'm exposed to those people
now that still leaves
one gigantic
kind of benefit that Anonymous people
bring that's unaddressed and we wouldn't
want to lose it
and that is there are some completely
Anonymous people who really need to stay
that way
because maybe some of the things they
say if they told you their job
you might know who they were right
because there's some Anonymous things
that only some people know about so if
you do the job that kind of would narrow
it down too much so there is a value
there's a real value for completely
Anonymous accounts
so how do you look how do you maintain
that value because they do have
something to say
how do you maintain that value now
nobody has a great answer for that
but some people say
um
Scott Scott
you can just block the people you don't
want to see so stop imposing your will
upon us I'm not doing that by the way
you haven't even heard my opinion I'm
not opposing it on anybody
so and the reason you haven't heard my
opinion is that I don't I'm not fully
informed I don't have quite a final
opinion on this I have maybe 75 of an
opinion
and people say to me Scott why don't you
just block the people you don't like and
leave us alone like the rest of us are
okay
if you're a and just block the
people you don't want to see and done
you know why that doesn't work right
do you all know why that doesn't work
yeah for the larger accounts it's it
would be endless
and the the motivated trolls literally
just take their other account and come
back
now if you don't have a big account
you've never seen that before
but I block people and they come back in
five minutes
blocking doesn't make any difference the
motivated trolls just use their other
troll account or start another one in
five minutes or something but they come
right back
right
is that you're a rich hire somebody you
can't hire somebody
to block people based on your opinion
that's not a job
so here's the other thing that people
get wrong
uh when Jordan Peterson is talking about
I think he's stopping short of giving
you his preferred
um you know final solution I won't say
final solution I think he's not giving
you his preferred solution
I think he's sort of raising the topic
because it's a good topic that so I
would not give him trouble on that but I
will add my own uh Global Dr Jordan
Peterson criticism because apparently
um that's that's a popular thing to do
now
does everybody notice that criticizing
Jordan Peterson is it's like a really
popular thing now
a lot of people who had maybe been more
Pro Peterson or he's starting to to wear
a thin and I wonder why
I wonder why and I've got some
hypotheses
number one
there are a lot of people such as myself
who could accurately be called the poor
man's Jordan Peterson
meaning that I talk about a lot of
overlapping topics with him but I don't
have his credentials or his his success
or faith
so
I'm completely aware of the fact
that there's a jealousy component
right it's really hard to look at him
like just just cleaning up I mean he's
really making a a big you know
impression on reality it's hard to watch
that
if you wish you could be doing the same
thing but you're you're like an aunt
compared to an elephant right the ant
doesn't feel real good about the
elephant
so as a member of the ant class I get
that
because because I have to fight it
myself
like I feel myself
getting into that petty jealousy kind of
mode in my mind but I'm also aware of it
so I try to I try to be bigger than that
but it's hard
so some of it is just as successful now
I get the same thing right people who
are less successful than I am are really
angry at me
so you've watched me on Twitter probably
that probably 75 of my most vocal
critics actually identified themselves
as professional writers
who are all less successful than I am
coincidence is it a coincidence that the
people were professionally in the same
field but less successful are all really
mad at me boy are they mad at what I
said yesterday boy they need to take me
down a rung and of course they always
say I used to like him
can I can I make a little aside
when you're criticizing famous people
I'll put myself in that category for
this conversation
when you start out your criticism with I
used to like them but
foreign
your credibility just goes right through
the floor it just goes right through the
floor
because usually the person hasn't
changed that much usually it's something
about you you know so anyway that's just
a personal thing
but um I would say that uh in my opinion
Jordan Peterson has uh one flaw
according to me right and it's not like
I'm the I'm not the Arbiter of
flaws and people were smarter than I am
so I'm always a little cautious he's
definitely smarter than me
would you all agree
can I get a yes Jordan Peter is smarter
than I am right so when you criticize
people who are smarter than you
and also way better informed way better
informed
you should have a little bit of humility
right a little bit of humility when you
do that
I I do have one criticism
and I don't even know if he would
disagree with it you know actually if I
if I said it to him in person I suspect
he would he would take it as a
semi-valid comment even if he didn't
agree with it it goes like this
especially on his relationship and
marriage advice and then some other
categories
I think he designs advice for people
like him
do you know what I mean
so when he talks about marriage being
you know the the best model Etc I think
he's right
for people like him
and when he talks about the
uh the anonymous users on Twitter
I feel like he's talking about
what the experience is like for people
like him
and now I'm you know a lesser version of
people like him because I have you know
a lot of followers
and I can so therefore I I get that like
what he says I'd like to be free from
the anonymous people or have the choice
to be to turn them off I get that
because they're a gigantic pain in the
ass
but
I can also imagine that a small account
wouldn't have any problem with them at
all because they bear you know the the
trolls don't really visit the smaller
accounts as much so they might say well
I like having the anonymous people they
don't bother me let's just keep it the
way it is
and I don't know if Peterson is quite
incorporating in his opinion how unique
his position is that the trolls are only
coming after people with big accounts so
it's a whole different problem so
whatever whatever is the right solution
for people like him
it would be a stretch to say that's the
right solution for people who are not
like him
in the important ways
all right so uh it's impossible for me
to block things here are some examples
that people said where maybe Twitter did
help
do you think that Twitter's Anonymous
users helped make Bitcoin succeed
yes or no Twitter's Anonymous users did
they make Bitcoin succeed
this is an argument that I heard today I
think no I think no but I understand yes
so I understand why you could say yes
so I'm not going to debate it but I
don't quite see it right it might be
true so I'm making a fine point here I'm
not disagreeing
I'm saying I I don't see the argument
but maybe maybe how about the uh
dissemination of any Wikileaks stuff do
you think Wikileaks being an anonymous
organization do you think that that that
benefited the world and Twitter allowing
them to be anonymous
help that I think I think yes I think
that's a good example
yeah that's probably a good example of
where Anonymous Twitter users had some
benefit
I'll give you that one
so this is why I have informed a final
opinion on this because I feel like we
just maybe need better choices they
handle more of our concerns our current
choices leave out some concerns
I definitely think that Anonymous people
on Twitter have some some value
and knowing the examples I think helps
us a little bit
um so Elon Musk tweeted this he was
talking about Jack Dorsey he was
actually responding to Jack
um
and Jack Dorsey was saying that all of
the Twitter files should be released
that we shouldn't be deciding what
people see and what they don't
everything that's on the right topic
should all be released now what do you
think about the fact that the ex-ceo of
Twitter
says everything should be released what
does that tell you about his own
potential let's say liability
well he's not worried about it yeah
clearly he doesn't have anything to hide
now
here's what musk says in response
he says most important data was hidden
and then parenthetically from you too in
other words musk is saying that the
prior CEO of of Twitter did not have the
information that musk has because it was
hidden from both of them but musk found
out
right and someday and some may have been
deleted
so we don't know how much has been
deleted and can't be recovered but
everything we find will be released
so musk agrees
now
I would like to take credit
for uh the best prediction in this
domain
for a couple of years or more I've been
saying I do not believe and I've been
saying this very aggressively I do not
believe that Jack Dorsey is aware of
what the staff is doing and I don't
think he has a way to find out
ah
I think the only reason that musk found
out is that he was willing to fire
anybody who gives him an ambiguous
answer to a question
and only the new that's something only
the new guy can do I'll say guy
generically right uh only the new guy
can fire you because your answer wasn't
convincing
like that's that's new guy energy the
the existing person has to treat
everybody as complete individuals right
you have to look at how long they've
worked there and all of your other
interactions and everything so it's hard
for the existing you know Legacy CEO
to be enough of a hard ass
to find out what's going on that's a
tough job and I think one of the reasons
this is just speculation I don't know
this for sure I think one of the reasons
that Jack was so supportive
of Elon Musk taking over is that even
Jack knew that he was in a let's say a
disadvantaged situation
for running the company plus he had two
companies right so that's that's also a
factor
so I think that you know musk has more
than two so maybe it wasn't a factor but
uh I think the new the new CEO has an
advantage that the leg the founder CEO
can never match
and I think that's what Elon brought I
think he also stirred the past so much
that it just allowed maybe some things
to to Bubble Up because you know the
whole Jim Baker thing only happened
because musk stirred the pot
otherwise you never would have even
heard that he was working there it was
only because Elon said let's make some
trouble with these Twitter files
that like brought up all the other stuff
so uh my claim that the CEO of Twitter
Jack Dorsey was not the one who was The
Mastermind behind any bad things that
happened in terms of suppression Etc and
I'm I still believe that
now we could we could find out
differently I mean anything could happen
but at the moment would you give me that
that was the best the best prediction
the most unlikely prediction
and also the best one about this topic
now one of my critics said this morning
uh Scott you never admit that you got
the Covington kids hoax wrong for all of
one day
I tell you that all the time I tell you
I got the you know Trump's vice
president pick wrong
I'm pretty sure that when I claim
victory I I often try to you know tell
you that I which ones I got wrong
because you can learn as much from the
ones I get wrong as once I get right
because there's a pattern to both right
the ones I get right are because I had
some special information
either I knew something about persuasion
or in the case of Twitter I personally
interacted with Dorsey and I I didn't
think there was any chance he was lying
to me right because I'm pretty good at
pretty good at seeing if people if
people are weasels and he doesn't have
any weasel energy whatsoever
that's the weirdest backhand compliment
I've ever given he has no weasel energy
like you you can tell weasel energy when
you see it can't you like even if
they're not lying to you at the moment
you say to yourself but they could lie
to me like they they have that potential
maybe not now but they have that
potential
yeah SPF he has that potential but Jack
doesn't look or have that energy at all
at all like it's just completely absent
so yeah if I'm wrong about that I'm the
worst judge of character in the world
but but I don't think I'm wrong
um some shocking information about
the mental health of teens
the CDC found that 45
of high school students were so
persistently sad or hopeless in 2021
they were unable to engage in regular
activities
almost one in five seriously considered
suicide
almost one in five
and
um and nine percent surveyed tried to
actually do it
they tried to actually take their lives
so the conclusion of this is
that the pandemic
increased teen suicide correct
is that the conclusion
thank you
thank you over on locals a well a
well-educated person just said what was
the Baseline do you know what
the Baseline was
the same
yeah it's the Baseline now it is it is
higher all right let me let me be more
technically accurate it's a little bit
higher but it's not shockingly higher
it's about a little bit higher like you
would expect right it didn't double it
right like not nine percent attempting
it is actually Baseline
I mean it's hideous that it's Baseline
but it is it is yeah
um when I when I first read that one in
was it
um one in five seriously considered
suicide do you know what my first
impression was
that seemed low
I thought that was lower than the
Baseline you tell me only one in five
teenagers consider suicide really just
one in five
I don't believe that I think it's at
least two and five
I think it's at least double
but that but this gets down to the
definition of consider doesn't it you
know I I gave a whole description of
what that means and in my in my view
I literally consider it every day
and then I completely rule it out
completely rule it out so am I
considering suicide
if you say that out loud yeah you're
going to be immediately put into the put
into the channel of people who look like
they're going to do it any minute
because nobody's going to take a chance
on that but I don't know how do kids
answer the question did you consider it
well suppose they thought about it for a
little while and then ruled it out
if you ask them if they considered it
are they going to say yes
are they going to say I thought about it
and then I ruled it out
does it does a kid
know that that would be called
considering it
I don't know I think one in five is low
now if they said you know how serious
were you did you make an actual plan to
do it and then then that would get a
whole different kind of answer
all right
so
uh what percent of Americans escorting
to Rasmussen what percent of Americans
believe that the vaccinations were uh
were a good idea
what do you think
um well let me put it this way and by
the way I'm going to do a demonstration
for for anybody who's new to this live
stream
I'm gonna you're so good I'm going to do
a demonstration of how smart
and how psychic
my audience is
I can ask a question that they do not
know the answer to and watch watch how
well they they perform just watch this
according to Rasmussen
uh what percentage of the voting adults
say that vaccines and I'm talking about
the
um the covert vaccine what percentage of
adults say that they are very effective
at preventing infection
preventing the spread
four percent
ah look at you
oh you're so smart
yeah it's 26 percent but I think there's
a one percent uh at least margin of
error there
yeah
all right how about I'm going to try
again
um
how many Democrats this is just
Democrats voters uh how many all are
quote not at all worried about any harm
from the vaccination itself
how many Democrats are completely
unworried
about the vaccination might have some
side effects
wow
uh 26 percent are not worried at all
26 percent
uh some of you are answering the you
know the obvious the the 70 75 yeah but
uh congratulations again I I feel that
uh your your Brilliance and genius has
exceeded only by your sex appeal uh if I
may say that and again
uh how many of you thought it was
ridiculous the first time you heard me
say
that in any poll 25 percent of the
public will get the wrong answer
reliably
yeah you thought I was just like
spitballing on that didn't you you
didn't think it was going to be so
consistent did you
all right
um and how about
reparations what percentage of the uh
let's see
let's say of the total public
now let's do it by uh party what percent
of the Democrats and this this will be
harder to guess what percent of
Democrats support reparations
what do you think
the answer is 60 percent
this is of the the population in general
sixty percent
how many of you knew that
was that about why you imagined I'm not
sure I thought about it too much but
I don't know
not too surprising all right
um
36 percent of Voters support the
California plan
uh you know the Californian plan
for reparations the California plan for
reparations is you take California a
state that never had slavery
and then the state that never had
slavery will be taxing a little bit
extra the people who are not involved in
any way with slavery and then they'll be
transferring that to the people who were
also never slaves
so that's the plan but some of those
people might be related to the legacy of
slavery and so that would be their
argument for reparations and
um yeah as you might imagine it's it's
divided by party affiliation
just like you think it would be
all right uh
opinion person Liz peek wrote on Fox
website how many of you would agree with
this opinion I'll just read this one
paragraph
so Liz says the midterms were
a referendum on the increasing
unpopularity of Mr Trump so she's saying
the the midterms were not about the
Democrats
it was mostly about voting against Trump
that's her take and she says yes he
still has a lock on some declining
portion of the Republican party and yes
Trump always the Trump always voters May
refuse to back anyone else ever that is
unfortunate because Trump's greatest
achievement was bringing hundreds of
thousands maybe millions of people into
our political process for the first time
now the problem is that she thinks that
Trump is now a drag on Republicans
because Trump won't bring in new
Republicans but he might bring in more
heat from people who want to make sure
he doesn't get back in here what do you
think do you think Trump is now A Plus
or a negative
to Republicans in general and she's
riffing off the uh the fact that
Herschel Walker lost if Herschel Walker
had won that would have been a stronger
argument for
Trump
I I think I'm interested just that the
argument has been made meaning that Fox
News carried this opinion piece that's
you know unambiguously anti-trump and
so that's where Fox News is which means
that's where Murdoch is
um no I'm not supporting him is that a
surprise
I was just asked if I were supporting
Trump
you all know I'm not right
yeah I don't support them for age
uh I don't support him as the best
person who could do the job
yeah I don't support him on fentanyl I
don't think he did a good job there
uh he couldn't even get Tick Tock banned
yeah so there's there's lots of stuff I
I'm generally in favor of uh
uh kind of uh a seesaw between the two
parties I I think that one party gets in
there and does some good things
especially for their base the next party
gets in there does a few other things
but the things that are good for
everybody tend to last
you know that it's a messy process
but I kind of like going back and forth
a little bit a little bit
I think it helps
all right
um there is a really interesting article
if you look at the timcast website you
can find it and apparently after yay and
Fuentes were on uh Tim's show
uh Tim pool show and after he walked out
he left the interview early one of the
Tim pool Associates there followed yay
and got got a lot more interaction with
him and then actually met with him in LA
and interviewed a bit length and then
talks about it
here's here's the two things you need to
know about it number one it's a really
long piece
and it's the longest piece I've read
completely to land in a long time
because it never got boring
and I kept I kept waiting pretty much
everything I read I skim
pretty much everything right but I
didn't skim it because it was so well
written so kudos to the writer
so it's just good writing right so if
you want to just see good writing read
it for that because it's so rare and
just tell yourself how long you wrote
how long you stayed with the article
without without bailing out I'll give
the name of the
the writer was a Shane Cashman who
apparently uh is or was a professor at
some point so it's somebody who's got
some good communication skills
yes uh he was raised uh culturally
Jewish I think I think his mother was
Jewish he says which I think technically
technically makes you Jewish I don't
think he's like an observing
uh type
all right so here are some of the things
that came out of that that I thought
were interesting
number one
yea does not appear crazy at all
so somebody spent some you know good
time with him when he was not performing
because you know when he's on an
interview he's performing right but when
you see him completely outside the
public domain you get to see if he's
crazy
and there wasn't any
so he spent enough time with him to find
out if any crazy was coming out of
them and there wasn't
that actually
uh that yea's sort of approach does have
an internal logic to it
and you could love it or hate it but
it's not crazy
it's not crazy
now it takes some explaining how that's
not crazy
but there's one part that I just loved
yea is completely aware
that his communication director Fuentes
is the most disliked person by one of
the most disliked
persons on the internet who you wouldn't
even want to interact with right now
that's not my opinion that would be sort
of like an internet opinion of him which
I'm sure he'd agree with
now yay
describes himself as one of the most
popular people in the world
and and certainly somebody that the most
people would want to talk to all right
the most people would want to get to yay
so yay has made it so that to talk to
the most the most interesting person
that you do want to talk to yay you have
to go through the worst person in the
world to get there
and he did that intentionally
now how much do you love that
right forget about what you think about
Fuentes for a moment just think about
the system
just think about the fact that he did
that intentionally
now you tell me that's not art
that's art
right that is Art everything he does
is you know sometimes functional you
know often functional because he's
successful but while he's being
functional it's never not art
is still art like that's who he is it's
just it just work it just follows him
like everything he touches becomes art
yeah
um
so that's interesting
uh
and uh then Fuentes I think gave some
more information about why he and yay
could get together in the first place
have you ever wondered about that
even if you accept that you know yay is
eclectic and eccentric or crazy or
whatever you want to say so you could
make an excuse you could kind of
understand how yay would want to work
with anybody basically because he does
refer to them as His you know little
rogue group of outcasts or something but
why would Fuentes want to work with yay
do you think that Fuente's audience
is like really happy
that he's supporting a black guy for
president
I don't know
I'm kind of curious about that
but what is it that brought them
together
what is it that brought them together
now some of you might say well you know
famous people and they both they both
hate Jews is what you're going to say
right somebody's saying that maybe maybe
but when they talk about it they talk
about making the country a Christian
country
and I think that uh at least one day
said and maybe yay believes this I don't
know that you shouldn't be running for
office unless you're a Christian
and that they'd like to see even the
Constitution
maybe tweaked to say that office holders
need to be Christians
now
I'm sorry that's not the country I live
in
I'm completely okay with our our system
being informed by Christians and formed
by Christianity that seems to have
worked right it works more than it
doesn't work
but as soon as you say that like that
Scott can't run for office in the
country he lives in no yeah you can't be
my president
I'm sorry you cannot be my president if
your platform is I can't run for office
because I don't believe in your version
of religion
no
no that is completely disqualifying
but you know what I love
I love the fact that they're sort of
cheerful Warriors and the fact that
they're fighting for this thing and
they're making their argument in a free
market of ideas
and it's interesting I find it
interesting
I'm never going to agree with it
but I like I like you know being exposed
to the thought process
Etc
I like taking my mind someplace it
wasn't before I never really thought
about that
now
um I believe also that yay said during
this interview
that he thinks the Jews should forgive
Hitler
now that's something you didn't say in
public but you said it to somebody who's
you know obviously going to write about
it but the Jews should forgive Hitler
now that's pretty provocative
but it also perfectly captures his
philosophy
his philosophy I believe
is that if he were a Jew he would
forgive Hillary
because forgiving this was built into
everything everything he's about
now that's interesting isn't it because
that that frames it a little differently
doesn't it
uh imagine the argument was it started
out with yay complemented Hiller
right he didn't complement the Holocaust
he said he liked some things about
Hiller like building roads and stuff it
was sort of a funny argument
but
um
but did he did he say Hitler is overall
good no of course not forgiveness is not
about the person being worthy of the
forgiveness
it's about you it's about it's about the
forgiver
but now now I suppose yay takes his
argument
all the way from uh Hitler had some good
points
all the way to the Jews should forgive
Hillary
do you see what that does to your brain
do you see what that does this is like
Overton window
just perfectly used it's hard to go back
to your last opinion because the new
one's just more interesting right as
soon as he says the Jews should forgive
Hillary you're like okay I cannot not
think about that and I already
completely have forgotten what you said
about Hitler's good points because now
you've gone so much further that now we
have to think about this and then you
think about and you say
oh wait a minute that's just a Christian
principle
and then all of a sudden you're like
what the hell is yea doing to us
it's just a Christian principle
yeah yeah it's it's an attempt at a high
road right
because what
you know I I don't know that he thinks
is a practical thing but as a
philosophical point it gets you past the
controversial stuff and onto something
that's actually an interesting question
no matter no matter where you are on it
now here's another thing that I don't
know if you caught
and he said it fairly clearly to this
reporter well to Shane uh
what do you think yay's opinion of
Jewish people is based on what he said
based on what he said what would you say
his opinion is of Jewish people go
give me your summary of yay's opinion of
Jewish people based on what he said
you say negative but give me the example
what what's what's the negative thing
you said
specifically
well you said he loves them and he is
one
okay
he said that he was going to go death
gone on the Jews right
so he said he was gonna
he was going to be aggressive against
the Jews
what's happening
so here's what happens when you see his
context
so when he talks about the Jewish
Community it's all compliments
and that was always the context
the context is
that the Jewish Community is he actually
says it directly
smarter than average more successful and
that he would like to emulate some of
their methods because he keeps running
into a successful Jewish people
who are you know
powerful enough that he's not getting
what he wants out of his interactions so
he would like to be more like them
pretty specifically saying that you
would like to learn from what they do
and be more their equal
in business
is that terrible
is that terrible
that he he sees them as above his
current ability
and also ability of other people
and he would like to rise to that level
so that he's an equal force in the
marketplace
as I see Spillway am I spilling
I'm telling you what he said is that
spinning
I don't know
no he said death gun right what he meant
was Defcon
but he meant what he meant was he was
sort of going to war against what he
called you know the Jews
but what did he mean
his his detailed explanation is all
competence
is there such a thing as a racist who
believes that that a group is better
than his own his own people
is that a thing can you be an
anti-semite by saying that Jewish people
are superior to you and maybe other
people as well
because that's what he says
I mean he says it very directly he's not
even beating around the bush they're
more successful they're smarter they're
killing it in business I keep bumping
into them and not getting what I want I
need to raise my power level
up to their level maybe I can learn
something from them
and I'm going to go hard at this I'm
going to I'm going to be fighting as he
would say fighting the Jews and then the
the corollary argument is
can he as a free person in the United
States
speak sloppily about his own personal
opinion
because I think it's sloppy to say the
Jews would you agree that's just sloppy
but does he have the right to be sloppy
he wasn't trying to hurt anybody and
language does have a risk no matter what
you're saying it just seems to always
have a risk
I don't know it's an interesting
question
I think he has a right to be sloppy
and you have a right to react to that
sloppiness in a negative way
I don't see a big problem
um
yeah
because the thing is that he also
consistently speaks of black people and
other people the same way
he uses the same level of sloppiness to
talk about you know
I don't know everything basically
everything is the white people matter
like I said he talks about groups like
they're they're all one one thing now
should he I don't know
I don't know I don't have an opinion on
that but if you think that he's he's
insulting a group
because he speaks to them as a whole
that doesn't hold up because he speaks
of every group including his own as a
whole is simply the way he talks and if
you said well but he's also insulting
them that's different you can speak
about your own group as a whole if
you're not insulting him
but don't talk about somebody else's
group and then insult them
but he didn't
he complimented them
I don't know now
if I were Jewish would I be saying what
I'm saying now
do you think I would have this view of
things if I were Jewish
no way
no way
no no
you know what I would feel if I were
Jewish
 that guy
 that guy hard
 him for putting me in at a greater
risk him for making me think about
the Holocaust one more time you know
 him for say he likes Hitler
him completely if I were Jewish
all right
so
but why why do I have empathy
for
you know my beloved fellow Jewish
citizens why do I have so much empathy
for their how they should feel in that
situation because I would feel exactly
the same way but why don't we extend
that to yay
who's had a a bunch of individual
individuals he's had a hard time with
and he's just sort of generalizing them
because he's speaking sloppy
why don't we understand why he is also
in an emotionally irrational situation
because something that would trigger
anybody into an irrational mode happen
to him
so the same way I say if I were Jewish I
would be reacting essentially from my
emotional defense protect myself you
know any any movement in the wrong
direction has to be stopped immediately
I would act exactly like that of course
you would too right
but if I were yay I would also probably
be affected the same way he was right if
I ran into one one demographic group
that kept being my obstacle
I'd probably have a bad attitude about
him and I allow that people should be
able to have that attitude I don't want
to agree with it I don't always want to
see it
right maybe you should keep it to
yourself but can we really blame people
for having let's say let's say you've
been married three times and you're
either male or female doesn't matter in
my example and all three times it was
just terrible
he got married three times they're all
disasters you don't think you'd have a
bad feeling about either men if you're a
woman or a woman if you're a man
I do and I would allow you to have that
opinion I would not I would not
criticize you for saying all men are
 or all women are terrible I would
say you weren't that that is exactly
what you should be feeling because
you've had that experience I'm not
adopting it I'm not going to be
influenced by it but I get I allow you
to have that opinion
so I allow that the Jews
should treat yea unfairly
and I'm fine with that
because I would do the same
thing you put me in that situation and I
would not be looking for fairness
I'd be looking to stop that completely
right but
yeah yeah was allegedly a victim of
some business and other personal
situations that seemed to present a
pattern to him nobody including yay
thinks that pattern holds to all Jewish
people
would you agree with that do you think
that yay would say oh yes I do believe
that all all Jewish people act the same
and aren't the same of course not
so so the thing that you assume that
he's saying nobody would say he didn't
say it nobody says it not a not a single
person on Earth thinks it
it's a ridiculous uh way to frame him
so once you realize he's not trying to
make anybody like him at the moment
he has insulted everybody he's called
everybody by their category at least
once it looks different
all right here are the people who should
be kicked off of social media here's the
comment Scott is more ridiculous every
day you
 your stupid little
comment here's the thing if you've got a
problem with what I say you got plenty
of time to say it if you want to
just say something about me
I hate your little piece of
existence
really
let's go go go kill yourself
all right
um
so
we'll see if yay can turn this ship
um The Shane when he wrote about him
still believes that yea would be a good
president
so so uh the individual I was just
talking about who was talking to yay
believed before and still does that he
might be a good president
what do you think oh and by the way yay
said he would run as a Republican
because he doesn't think independent can
win
too unstable for the nuclear football
I don't think so
I don't think EA is too unstable for the
nuclear football
well you think he's gonna you think he's
gonna launch I don't
oh Aardvark
um thank you for that so I'm finishing
up my book on reframes and I was just
doing a like an author's reread
yesterday where I I read it like I'm a
consumer for the first part and I have
to tell you it's the best thing I've
done
I think it's going to change the world
like it's
here's what it does it it takes all the
most persuasive little reframes and puts
them in one place so if you've got any
problems from personal to business to
understanding reality itself there
there's probably more than one reframe
that's very powerful
that you haven't been exposed to yet
and
the the power of these reframes so far I
think I have over 130 of them in the
book
you're going to find at least 10 that
will rock your world
it might be a different 10 from somebody
else's 10 because it's based on what you
need in your life but they are so strong
when you see them all together
uh
this will be the best thing I've ever
done
in terms of usefulness to other people
in terms of usefulness to other people
this will be unparalleled nothing will
be close
yeah uh yeah I stopped I'm not going to
say it's a masterpiece that's that's
that's a different connotation I'm going
to say useful it's going to be the most
useful thing that's ever been produced I
think
like actually might actually be the most
useful yeah outside of maybe the Bible
or something if you want to go that way
but yeah there's nothing I've created
that would be this level of direct
benefit to your your life
uh just read Jeffries if you want to
understand what neuro-linguistic
programming does to you well I already
understand that
it's like a book of spells yeah that's
exactly what it is
huh
so another story I forgot there was that
I saw AI was asked to do some hypnosis
and I couldn't do it I mean it tried but
it didn't know the technique it just did
you know you're getting sleepy kind of
stuff which is not really the technique
so
AI doesn't know how to do hypnosis
you don't want to be alive when it does
if it ever learns to do hypnosis and
presumably it could I mean I could train
it in an afternoon
you're in trouble
I mean we don't know what this AI is
going to do to us but I can tell you
every prediction about the future is
useless
Everything Will Change
do you all you all get that right I
think a lot of people still have a view
of AI this could be a a wonky little me
too thing that's playing while we go on
with their lives as normal
your life will not be recognizable in
five years
civilization won't even be recognizable
everything will be different everything
yeah it's beyond imagine is literally
Beyond imagination
yep
all right
um
I thought people had to be willing to be
hypnotized
all right so here's a good question
um does advertising work
if you're unwilling
yeah it does does persuasion in general
work
if you're you know on the other team
well sometimes I mean it's hard to
change anybody's mind to anything
sometimes yeah
but uh when I say hypnosis uh I don't
mean it will put you into a trance
although it could it could but it
doesn't need to do that
because there's uh I call it a talking
hypnosis
if I just had a conversation with you
you might find yourself very persuaded
and you wouldn't know what happened
and and I would not necessarily even
know
that I'd use hypnosis on you because I
wouldn't be conscious of it doing it I
would just know that the way I presented
it was compatible with hypnosis
incompatible with persuasion
because once you learn to speak in those
ways it's automatic it's like it's like
touch typing you don't think your
fingers are just the same way you talk
when you know persuasion you speak
persuasively without thinking through
every moment it just comes out that way
uh we talked about Brittany Greiner you
missed it it was the first thing I did
is Tick Tock like hypnosis yes
yes Tick Tock the reason you feel
addicted to it is that it's persuasive
is there a micro lesson on this uh not
exactly
so here's here's a thing that
um
people don't understand about hypnosis
it's true that you can't do a standard
hypnotic induction with somebody who
doesn't want to be there because they'll
just get up and walk away
or just not listen or whatever it
doesn't work
um but here's the workaround to that
you can remove people's objection
and then you can do it
so you can't do it if somebody doesn't
want to
but sometimes they don't object to
having their mind changed
you see the difference
if they definitely don't want to it
doesn't work
but but suppose you said okay I don't
want to and I said okay well let me
change your mind
you know and I would tell you the
hypnosis never heard anybody I would
tell you that you'd be aware the whole
time and you could you know come out of
it at will anytime you wanted and I
would give you what's called the
pre-talk that's part of hypnosis
actually the pre-talk is to convince you
that there's no risk
so that I convince you there's no risk
you'd say oh
okay the I guess I'm okay with that
and then I would hypnotize you
so it's a little bit of a trick one
hypnotists say because we always do to
protect ourselves you can't hypnotize
somebody who's unwilling
true
but you can make them willing
they don't we don't mention that we
don't mention the part where we make you
willing and then we have to touch you
by the way that's like the the greatest
unspoken secret of hypnosis
is that
it's sort of always happening like you
can't turn it off
it won't it won't matter if you know
yeah and the The Swinging watch thing
that's not part of hypnosis that doesn't
buy you anything
the ladies of coffee with Scott Adams
calendar coming soon
that would be a big hit
you had a hypnotist as a roommate in
college that's where you learned your
love of cleaning and doing dishes
did you
now I need to know more about that but
I'd love to know I'd love to know if you
volunteered
to be hypnotized so you would enjoy a
chores or did your hypnotist uh
hypnotize you to do his chores as well
as yours I could have gone either way
that is funny
have I ever hypnotized someone and
convince them to kill themselves oh
no
and by the way that doesn't work because
people have tried that yeah that's it's
never worked apparently pure pressure
can make somebody kill somebody but
actual hypnosis doesn't seem to have
that power
oh that was meant to be snarky okay
um
uh can someone be hypnotized to work
harder to get more money yes yes they
can assuming they want to work harder to
get more money well hypnosis is really
good at
is helping you perform better at
ordinary things that you want to perform
at
so it could make you better at tennis
golf you know can get get rid of The
Yips flying you know if you're afraid of
flying so it makes everything you do a
little bit better potentially
because you want to be better at those
things
all right that's all for now
as usual the most provocative and
challenging live stream in all the world
are autistic people less prone to
hypnosis
uh I've never seen anybody deal with
that question but my
experience says it should be the same
because generally speaking you cannot
identify and Advance someone who's easy
to hypnotize everybody can be hypnotized
but about 20 percent can actually see
things that don't exist and have like a
real a real experience that's incredible
but there's no correlation of IQ or
personality or anything that seems to
tell you in advance who's in the 20 so
my guess is that
anybody who can understand language
would be about the same
could a cure a kamala's cackle yes
yes
that would be actually a good use yeah
Kamala could learn through hypnosis
um not to have that reaction yes that
would be something
are we seeing yea's first big offer
I don't think that's not the way I would
couch it because I don't know what you
would call the first big offer
I think what he's doing is trying to
unify people
by slaying all of our sacred cows
because if you and I have a beef
here's an unintentional pun if we have a
beef
usually it's because I've got a sacred
cow and you've got a sacred cow and I
can't kill your sacred cow and you can't
and I can't kill mine so we got our like
our sacred cat was here
but
uh I think what yay is doing is like how
about I'll murder my cow
so you don't have any problems on my end
I'll just kill my cow I don't have any
sacred cows now but would you mind if I
kill your cow
see that's where he gets in trouble
right yeah the trouble is he's trying to
kill your cow
so when he when he said
um
that slavery sounds like a choice
he was trying to kill the sacred cow
which is oh
slavery is sort of our narrative that
gives us some political clout
when he went after the Jewish community
their sacred cow is
the Holocaust is the narrative that
gives them cover and power and you know
unites them and allows them to get
support and everything so yagos directly
after their sacred cow by saying Hitler
I love Hitler right that's the the he
basically just put a shiv right through
the sacred cow
so here's the thing so far he's only
wounded everybody's cow so we're all
just mad hey you you hurt my cow
stop hurting my cow
but
if he keeps pushing
he's going to kill your cow
and then what and then you're free and
so is he so he's tried to kill your cow
and you don't want your cow killed but
it's not clear that you're better off
with your cow
I I think his play is I think you're
better off without your cow
and I'm gonna I'm gonna kill it for you
and prove it
now
he's killed all of his own sacred cows
uh pretty sure he was worshiping money
just a few weeks ago
was he
you know like he was proud of being the
richest black guy in America and stuff
and like he just threw it all away
for the freedom
he killed his own cow
yeah
so
one more topic uh house passes Landmark
Bill to protect same-sex marriages
sending it to Biden's desk
well that's what Congress is for
that's what Congress is for
so
um do you think
it makes any difference that there would
be a federal law
uh making it legal for same-sex people
to get married you think that makes any
difference
I mean it makes a difference in the
sense that there are some states that
might
try to ban it
I know
um has anybody been damaged by a gay
marriage
so here's the thing you know I always
talk about a b testing gay marriage has
been tested
has it not
is there some big like emergency problem
from all the gays getting married and
they cause some problems that I don't
know about
if I had to guess
I'll bet you the gay marriages are
successful at least as successful
as any other kind and maybe more I mean
I'm leaning toward maybe more but I
don't know
the reason I say more is that it just
makes sense to me that two people of the
same gender would have a little bit more
in common in the you know sticking
together area
it seems like it'd be some advantage
yeah birth rates would be affected but
still Freedom requires that we get to
decide if we have kids or not
uh
so would you agree with my statement
that gay marriage has been tested
thoroughly tested and that there doesn't
seem to be any downside at all
would you agree with that statement
what's the downside
if you think there's a downside uh
mention it
well
churches lose tax status
yeah that's maybe that's a sub that's a
sub issue that's a different issue but
that's an important one
uh
yeah okay
well I would so I guess that's my take
my my take is you don't need to test
something that's been that thoroughly
tested and once something is tested and
it works
you keep those so to me this looks like
a good evolution
it evolves us from something we tested
and and most people agree now I'll
accept that maybe other people are you
know disagreeing with it but even you
would agree that it worked even if you
don't like it right would you agree
yeah I mean it hasn't caused any problem
I can see
you know what you never hear
I I don't want to be walking in that
neighborhood at night because it's an
lgbtq neighborhood
you know because those dangerous
criminal lgbtq people might beat me up
if I go there
you know I don't think there's any uh
demographic group
that has been more successful than the
lgbtq community
I mean talk about people who are you
know definitely adding to your country
that they're adding a lot
a lot
really you doubt that
you don't think the LGBT community is
yet another Super advantage of America
because if you do you haven't been
paying attention because they're killing
it
they're killing it in all all kinds of
domains
you know
uh and always have you know from from
Newton to Da Vinci to uh maybe Tesla
you know aren't some of the most famous
successful people in the world
they were known to be gay right
so
uh
if you look at let's see was it
Indonesia that just made
uh
just made a premarital sex illegal but
I'm sure they have some views about the
LGBT community don't you think that a
country that
gives you know full appreciation to the
LGBT community
guess more value
a lot more
than a society that oppresses them
isn't it obvious
would anybody disagree with that
to me is obvious it's like this entire
historically super successful community
that why would you want to suppress some
of your most successful people
historically
yeah I know so I think that's something
we do right
um I don't know if the rule was
necessary you know I don't know if we
need a federal rule but I'm I'm always
happy when you a B test something it
works and then you codify it
to me that's perfect
that's exactly what I want
if it hadn't worked like if there was
some big problem then I'd say no don't
codify that but
to me it looks like it worked
Sarah says stop lying
what do you think I'm lying about
you know I often say that you know the
question of should you lie or should you
not is the wrong question
the the right question is shouldn't you
live your life in a way where you don't
need to
like that that's the that's the goal is
to simply not need to
and I you know I'm not sure you can get
all the way to not needing to because it
seems like there's always some reason
you always need to lie to a terrorist to
save somebody's life right there's
always going to be a reason but you know
try to get as close as you can to not
having any reason to lie
and
I'm pretty close to that with this live
stream
pretty close I mean I can't think of
anything that I've lied about
so I don't I don't ever feel an Impulse
to lie
like that's never in my mind it's like
oh I better lie about this because I
feel like you know you've you've all
become the kind of people who can hear
provocative views and not blow up
Rashi says Scott thinks he's telling the
truth but he's wrong his perceived truth
is wonky well I agree with you yes truth
is subjective so the only thing I can
claim is that the thing I think is true
is what I'm saying that's all I'm saying
uh
if gay marriage was successful they
wouldn't need the bill
that's not true
that doesn't follow logically
um
the downside of gay marriage and what
about the project Veritas latest video
I'm not sure what that point is but I
think you're saying
that there's a project Veritas video
that might go to a grooming
is it was that a grooming question
are you honestly conflating gay marriage
with grooming
because that would be very distasteful
am I
or is there something more to that
is it more to the story
but I hope you didn't just do that did
you did you just say that gay marriage
is leading to grooming
because that's that would be an odious
opinion
huh
right uh well I so I I see those
um
I see those as disconnected topics
all right
um the incidence is higher
I don't know how to find a good
hypnotist
because the trouble is
they're hypnotists
yea doesn't try to offend uh
Jesus or Muhammad well he's a pro-jesus
guy that's his whole point
um I've I've heard yea say positive
things about Islam
but I don't know if I've heard negative
things I don't know
draw a cartoon of Muhammad somebody says
you know what
I I'm okay with everybody having their
one thing
right if black people want to have the
n-word for themselves
I think well hey I want to use all the
words too but that's such a small ask
it's such a small thing to ask all right
so if if Islam
wants cartoonists not to draw comics of
them
my first impression is I want to be able
to draw a comic about anything I want
and then I think well that's the
smallest thing to ask for and that's
really a small ask if the only thing I
can't do is draw a comic about you know
one one religious group
it doesn't affect me too much
yeah even if no matter what you think of
the ask it's very small
uh we left behind a U.S marine to secure
the release of grinder
well I assume the U.S marine is already
come back
um
oh the Marine has been there for five
years oh you're talking about the guy we
didn't didn't bring back
all right yeah
yeah well it is still there right
all right that's all for now
YouTube I'll see you tomorrow I'm going
to talk to the locals people for a
moment
