you worked a little bit harder than you
needed to yesterday didn't get enough
sleep but still you're here you're
winners but if you'd like to take this
up to levels that even winners can
barely understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need is a cup or
muger glass a tanker shell a sign a
canteen jugg or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope mean of the
day it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous
and it happens
now technology is working thanks
Paul all right we're going to do a speed
round of you should have just asked
Scott you ready for this speed round uh
women orgasm or readily during sex with
a handsome partner according to the
conversation well you didn't really need
to do that study you could have just
asked me yes women orgasm more readily
with a better looking guy number two
according to Andrew huberman he's
reinforcing the idea he says remember
when they used to say that drinking some
wine was good for your health and
actually better than not drinking
alcohol now everyone pretty much agrees
that no alcohol is best what what a
ridiculous amount of back and forth that
took do as you wish but know what you're
doing um or you could have just asked
Scott about 25 years ago when I first
said hey what are the odds that alcohol
is actually good for you I'm not buying
this at all it's poison should have
asked Scott there's another study that
found that while gender stereotypes are
often viewed as
misleading they are surprisingly
accurate
so they did a study where people guessed
whether men or
women would be higher on certain traits
and it turns out that a random person
can guess right about 85% of the time
guessing if men or women are better at a
random trait uh this is according to S
poost you know what you could have done
instead you could have asked Scott yes I
think I would have told you that male
female stereotypes are not random
they're not random at
all here's another one uh an ugly truth
according to study finds attractive
workers earn more money than
unattractive
people you just could have asked me I
mean really just ask me you didn't need
to spend a penny on this
one anyway that's a speed round so
there's there's your science for you
every bit of it is you could have
just asked Scott uhhuh yeah yep alcohol
is bad for you pretty people get more
money yep men and women are different I
could have got all of that uh there's a
Korean
filmmaker um named bong Jun
ho he says his new film is called Mickey
17 it has Mark ruffa in it who a big
critic of trump uh but he says it's not
parodying
parodying Trump um the villain played by
Mark Ruffalo no no it's not it's not
supposed to remind you of trump although
critics say that the comparisons to
Trump are so obvious that and numerous
that of course it's being inspired by
that but uh here's the thing I wanted to
point out the Korean filmmaker his name
is bong June ho which coincidentally was
my nickname in
college see because I was born in
June so I'm sort of a bong June
ho okay that's all I had on that one did
you see that bill NY the Science Guy did
a Nazi
salute he was had some rally for
standing up for Science and he he did
I'm not even going to do it good
because I would be blamed of giving a
Nazi salute but uh as you know the
entire world media stopped to condemn
him for giving his Nazi
salute wait that didn't
happen I'm
confused so when a Republican or a trump
supporter lifts his arm above his waist
we get four weeks of non-stop
he's a Nazi he's Nazi he's a Nazi and
then the theater kids go wild theater
kids do it he's a Nazi he's a Nazi well
look at his arm oh anybody who raises
their arm in here must be a
doy and then Bill NY does
it he's just waving low what are you
talking
about he's not a Nazi no he's just
pretending he's a Science
Guy well you've heard the the rumors
that the Obama was maybe separated and
possibly readying for divorce we don't
have any confirmation of that but U I'm
going to give you the hypnotist
confirmation um I saw the messages today
hadn't seen these before apparently on
Valentine's Day which wasn't that long
ago um they gave each other these
messages on social media that would
suggest they were
together but uh let's do a little bit
closer look at these messages from a
persuasion perspective and see what we
can learn so Barack Obama said of
Moselle this was just this most recent
Valentine's Day 32 years together and
you still take my breath away Happy
Valentine's
Day Michelle
Obama and then Michelle separately said
if there's one person I can always count
on it's you Barack Obama you're my rock
always have been always will be happy
Valentine's Day
honey so do you see anything missing in
those
messages you know the the Valentine's
message let me give you a little bit of
Valentine's
advice if you're married and you give a
Valentine's message to your spouse and
it does doesn't include I love
you you don't love that person because
it's the most basic thing that you would
say it's not the thing that you leave
out it's the main thing it's the main
thing but it gets funnier I'll get to
read barack's message again 32 years
together and you still take my breath
away You Take My Breath Away do you
think she tried to smother him with a
pillow
do you think she was behind drowning the
chef and she maybe she threatened him
next you know I took his breath
away allegedly I'm just making that up
but uh you know if you don't shape up I
might be able to take your breath away
too so don't fall asleep pillow overhead
and then she says if there's one person
I can count on it's you well you know
what I would bet since Obama doesn't
seem like a cruel person or anything I
would bet that even in divorce if that's
what's happening uh he would be very
supportive support the kids support her
lifestyle so yeah he's a
rock um but uh yeah I'm going to say
that based on my reading of their
Valentine's message there's not really
much chance they're still together as a
romantic couple and if they were these
Valentine messages would have ended it
immediately have you ever met a woman
let's see going back to stereotypes
whether or not uh people can identify
male female stereotypes uh yes if you
forget to tell your spouse that you love
them it's going to be a problem it's
going to be a
problem all right
[Music]
um apparently did
that here's a hoax that I missed so I
guess msnbc's host uh aan I forget I
don't know what his first name is Iman
Aon so he was pushing according to Medi
lies who catches All These Little Things
Medi lies said he was pushing the debunk
lie that P Heth had ordered the removal
of the anola gay photos because of
Dei now I heard Bill Mah say that on his
show and and he said it like he really
believed it it wasn't just a joke so
Bill Mah also
believed that the Pentagon remove
pictures of the the the aircraft that
carried the first nuclear bomb over
Japan and that they took the photos away
because it said gay on it and nola
gay now who believed
that is that a little bit too on the
nose who in the world would be enough to
believe that happened in the real world
well Bill Maher and MSNBC host I
guess here's one of those small world
stories I've told you this before but it
just blows my mind so when I was a kid
my parents had this couple that were
sort of their main friends in town and
the husband uh actually was part of the
crew that loaded the nuclear weapon on
the anola gay he was on the island of
tinian where they loaded it and uh and
sure enough like he we always knew that
when we were kids he told us that um and
I I think he didn't know exactly what it
was because they were just the crew that
was supposed to load it they didn't have
top secret clearance about anything U
but I think they were guessing you know
that they saw how big it was and they
saw that they never seen anything like
it so I think they knew that something
big was coming uh they didn't know how
big but how weird is it that I know
somebody personally who loaded that on
the anola gay isn't that the weirdest
thing that I would like have a personal
connection to that so
weird anyway that's some the things the
dumb things
that Democrats pretend to believe even
if they
don't um so did you know that Stacy
Abrams had this some kind of a nonprofit
that had raised a as much as a
$100 um prior to Joe Biden gifting them
with two billion
dollar that they were going to use in
Georgia I guess mostly to uh buy buy
appliances for people that would be
better for uh
energy $2
billion now let me take a guess do you
think all that $2 billion was just
perect perfectly allocated and they kept
those uh kept the administrative fees
low and there wasn't any money
laundering and there wasn't any grift
and there weren't any Consultants that
got uh seven figure deals to figure out
where the money
went don't you assume at this point that
every organization that's well-funded
especially from the government but it
could also be from big donors don't you
assume that they're all
corrupt and
I really
wonder is it the same on the Republican
side because I don't really hear about
big Republican organizations that are
completely corrupt do they exist I mean
I'm I'm primed to think that it would be
Universal it has nothing to do with
being a democrat or a republican it's
just you know if you can get your beak
wet you do so but it does really seem if
you just look at the news it's just
seems like every single Democrat
organization is designed to be a money
laundering corrupt thing it looks like
it's designed like that speaking of that
uh you know act blue the big Democrat
organization that allegedly is
collecting small
donations and wrapping them up for uh
for
Democrats well they've done more than
that according to Elon Musk an
investigation found that five act blue
funded
groups uh were responsible for Tesla
protests oh are you telling me that the
Tesla protests are not completely
organic and rather they were just funded
by The Usual
Suspects well
apparently or at least allegedly
um so an act blue funders see who are
the people funding act blue besides the
small donations uh George Soros Reed
Hoffman and then three people I never
heard of before but if you see George
Soros and Reed Hoffman funding the same
entity they might not be up to
good they they may be up to something
that you don't want them to be
doing anyway apparently act blue is
currently under investigation for
allowing uh foreign and uh illegal
donations for some kind of criminal
violations okay so again I say are all
Democrat organizations
corrupt it does seem like it from the
the local city governments to the unions
that they usually control to act blue to
Stacy Abrams to the NGS and the 55,000
entities that USA gave money
to it feels like they're all corrupt
and designed to be that way as in the
entire thing is a grift to design little
entities that you can steal money
from well apparently Washington DC
finally cleared a homeless encampment
that was around the state department
post millennial is reporting on this and
it's something that they didn't do until
Trump basically threatened the city and
said if you don't do something about
this we're going to do something about
this and that would be pretty
embarrassing for this city so magically
they cleaned up the encampments oh I
guess they could have done it
anytime they just had to be
threatened so there's your local
government Democrats great meanwhile
according to Tech grunch uh Google is uh
getting rid of all their diversity
language they're not announcing that
they're getting rid of diversity or Dei
they're simply soft pedaling it the the
words are kind of changing and you know
they're scrubbing some of their websites
and stuff so no no announcement or
explanation but uh it does come as a lot
of companies are scrapping diversity so
I think they just wanted to be a little
quieter about it now to me the most
shocking thing about the all the
companies that are backing off on Dei uh
almost entirely because of the uh Trump
Administration pushing on it
doesn't it seem to you that the dog not
barking is the people who are trying
real hard to resist
it because these same companies were
just gung-ho for Dei I mean they were
all in for you know hundreds of millions
of dollars per year in you couldn't be
more in and then as soon as the
government says no it's illegal get rid
of
it there's no push
back where are all the
protests um the Google employees are
like yeah we we need this Dei again
don't tell us what we can do we want to
make the world a better
place it seems to me that Dei was never
popular right because if if it were ever
popular with just ordinary people they'd
be on the streets saying you stopped our
Dei how dare you stop our Dei
but nothing like that's happening there
are no Mass protests to maintain
Dei it was never
real it was never popular it was just
people literally
pretending oh like the theater
kids do you see the do you see the
pattern Republicans are mostly things
that Republicans have always wanted and
it hasn't changed much and then
Republicans try to get those things in
you know obvious uh government ways but
the Democrats are almost an entire
artificial construct it's literally just
theater kids pretending that they like
stuff and then the minute it's not
practical to like that stuff they just
change to another play all right well
we're not saying that anymore so uh yeah
we're not going to talk about the open
borders anymore open borders were like
their most important thing and then as
soon as Trump closes it they're
like so what's going on no protests
nobody saying you got to open those
borders up again give us back our
Dei put those homeless people back
around the state
department it it feels like every time
Trump does something it's really quiet
because they never believe these things
in the first place Dei I think was again
just a whole bunch of democrat scams it
was a way to grift and get paid for
doing not a lot of anything that was
useful so I think as soon as the grift
was identified and popped people didn't
really want to be public about it
because it would be embarrassing at this
point anyway according to Jonathan
Turley he's writing about how the UK is
continuing this month with his effort to
regulate and criminalized speech
specifically he says there's going to be
an effort in the UK to crack down on
islamophobia which is really close as
Turley points out to having a type of
blasphemy
standard that would only apply to
probably just one
religion if the UK designs a blasphemy
standard that says you can't criticize
the one religion
they're just
surrendering and that one religion will
eventually
dominate no doubt about it I think the
UK is
lost um I'm not even sure why we have
them as allies because it's just a
matter of
time it's a matter of
time and and the time it's not very long
time I think that they'll just be
essentially an Islamic country pretty
soon apparently there a bunch of big law
firms according to the W AUST General
that have decided it would be too
dangerous to uh to work on any kind of
trump opposition because the Trump
Administration
has acted pretty
decisively against some
lawyers who have been anti-trump and
done bad things so they Trump took the
Perkins koi law firm uh um I guess the
security clearances away and and there
were whole bunch of people got fired if
they worked on this or that lawfare
against Trump so he's making a point
that uh you could be a
lawyer doing your basically fake law
fair stuff or whatever it is against
Trump but there's going to be a response
to it and I like that I I like the fact
that there's now something more like a
mutually assured destruction yeah you
could be a lawyer and try to take down
our government but they are in
charge and if you get caught and you
break a
rule you're going to pay for it so good
there there should be definitely some
push back on that in California
according to the
guardian some of the prisons are using
virtual reality devices to give the
people who are in solitary
confinement something like virtual
Freedom so they can sit in their little
box but it'll feel like they're visiting
their relatives or traveling to Thailand
or paragliding those are the
examples and they can do VR art therapy
and
stuff and um critics are saying if uh if
the fancy technology just papers over
the inhuman inhumane system well yeah
that's what it's supposed to be
doing yeah it's an inhumane system and
they're trying to
make it a little more you know I guess
survivable
so that would be weird but I could
certainly see a bunch of people in
uh in their little cells just waiting to
put on their hat so they can be
somewhere else I mean I would want to do
it all day long now I don't know if they
fixed the part where you get a headache
from virtual
reality um I tried a system several
years ago so things have probably
improved quite a bit but I loved it some
of the games there was one that you know
you're basically on a glider around an
island that was just awesome and but it
would make me sick you know just from
the dizziness and make me sick in about
15 minutes didn't take long um so you
you'd have to like it enough that you
were willing to be sick for an hour
afterwards and eventually it talked me
out of using it because I thought you
know what it's just not worth being sick
for an
hour but it was
awesome as breit Bart is reporting the
department of ham
security um did locate the people who
were leaking the locations of the ice
raids which is very dangerous for the
ice people because if they plan to do a
raid and the people have been tipped off
there might be some kind of a uh you
know gunfire exchange or something that
didn't need to happen so those two
people that were caught face up to 10
years in federal
prison now I got to say on one hand that
seems pretty
extreme on the other hand the the danger
that they were putting law enforcement
type people into is Way Beyond The Pale
but you you could sort of Imagine
how they thought it was doing a good
thing not a bad thing in other words
they they thought they were doing what
was the right thing you know to protect
these people from the evil ice people
but
uh thinking you're on the right side of
it it should count for
something so I don't know if 10 years is
the right answer but I feel like at
least
five so we'll see
well according to uh Emerald Robinson he
says the uh the color Revolution against
the Trump Administration is just getting
started now if you don't know what a
color Revolution is it's how the United
States has organized um coups and other
countries but they have some
specific you know telltale signs if one
is happening so one would be a bunch of
fake protests that are just organized by
somebody paying
um and then here here's what Emerald
points out she says yes they want to
sabotage Elon Musk by burning a few
Teslas and writing media stories to hyp
it yeah it looks like they're organizing
protests and they're going to organize a
big anti- Elon Musk thing because as
long as Elon Musk and Trump are getting
along and producing good results for the
country then the Trump Administration
will get stronger
so they got to somehow destroy Elon Musk
before he succeeds too much now just
think about
that it's a real thing that there are
dark Forces in this country who might
even like getting rid of all the you
know the fraud and stuff unless they're
involved in it um and they still want to
get rid of
him because they need to win they need
to be in charge and uh then Emerald says
they'll run the bird flu panics she says
you live through 2020 so you know how it
works I don't want to believe it that
our government would do a bird flu panic
and now the latest news which is I think
unconfirmed that uh the thought is this
bird flu thing was actually developed in
a lab and and it may have some gain of
function in it to which I say how is
that even
possible how is it possible there's
still a lab working on gain of function
for the most deadly things how is it
possible that it's getting released sure
enough at exactly the same timeline as
Trump's first uh first um
term it's kind of
hard it's kind of hard to imagine that
these are
coincidences so so look for that look
for the uh look for the obvious signs of
a color Revolution because I think I
think it is in I I
agree that it looks like it's in motion
it looks like
it now I don't I don't know if you've
seen this uh video but there's a
compilation video of prominent de
Democrat senators in 2019 now remember
this date
2019 so this is the middle of the uh
first Trump
term and Sydney po was pointing this out
on on X so Ron weyden so Democrat Ron
widen senator Amy
cliter and kamla Harris as a senator
were all speaking out in public about
the unnecessary risks of using
electronic voting machines because they
said that they are by their nature um
unsecure electronic voting machines
2019 Democrat
Senators now what a bunch
of uh
effing
bastards that that that's a sort of
thing that was just sort of erased from
history like if I hadn't seen the video
compilation I wouldn't have known about
that it wasn't on the news do you
remember at any time that any of the
media the major media at any time did
they show when they were talking about
Trump doubting the 2020 election any
time did they show that the Democrats
have doubted even Trump's election and
still do and now Maxine Waters is
doubting the 2024 election because she
thinks that uh that Elon Musk uses
technology asked to affect it so that
whole that whole thing about oh there's
no way our election could ever be rigged
is not anything that the major Democrats
ever believed they never believed our
elections were secure in fact they were
speaking out of it speaking out publicly
and forcefully to say that our elections
are not secure and that we wouldn't
necessarily know who won
is that amazing is it's like
beyond belief that it could happen
now is this true of
Republicans because again you know I
might be in a bubble or something but it
looks like the Democrats literally don't
have actual views of anything they only
have
actors so at that moment since Trump was
in in office the theater kids said oh we
better put on in a play where we act
like uh he couldn't possibly be
legitimate because we don't have secure
elections and then when Biden wins they
go okay theater kids we're gonna we're
going to change everything now we're
going to put on a play where if you even
doubted if you had even any questions
about the legitimate of a US election
well you're some kind of insurrectionist
piece of crap and you probably belong in
jail with all the January Sixers
it is so obvious that the Democrats are
literally actors and don't believe
anything that they say from Dei that
suddenly is no problem at all if it's
disappearing to voting machines and
integrity to and they certainly didn't
believe there's no way they believed
that the only way to secure the Border
was with legislation from
Congress they didn't believe any of that
it's pure acting now I saw um Bill Mah
the other day on a clip he was saying
that he he's sort of giving up on the
fact checking against
Trump because he says we all get it
right we all get it that if he says if
he says uh let's say I I brought down
the border crossings to
zero well it might be you know a
thousand a day or some number like that
so he's
admitting that Trump um plays fast and
loose with the specific facts but it
doesn't seem to
matter and I think Bill Mah has finally
figured it out it doesn't seem to
matter that it would be hard for you to
come up with after years of trump not
passing the fact checking what happened
because of it what's the downside
and I've used the phrase directionally
correct which I think I inserted into
the at least the Republican part of mind
that once you really once you realize
that every time he doesn't pass the fact
check it doesn't matter because he's
persuading in the right direction so if
he says uh you know I brought down
inflation this much but you think it's
not that much well he's fighting hard to
bring down inflation so every time he
does something that seems to like a
little hyperbole a little exaggeration
or maybe just a madeup fact they're all
in the right direction so for
example the Doge
stuff is it true that he may have
mentioned some things that weren't
actually things like uh condoms for uh
the the Palestinians in
Gaza well not exactly true
but
directionally it was completely true
that money was being spent overseas on
things that you and I would think would
be not good uses of that money that's
the point so and that's very different
from the Democrat lies the Democrat lies
are there's no way to close a border no
that's not directionally correct that's
opposite when Democrats say um the the
election uh was Secure and there's no
way there's no way any possibility that
it was a rigged election in
2020 that's not directionally correct
it's the opposite so if you look at the
Democrat lies they're opposites from the
truth if you look at what Trump gets
criticized for it's always directionally
correct it's stuff Republicans want it's
stuff the Republicans um you know think
is important important it's exactly the
right
direction there's a big difference but
it's kind of important I think that
marah is very close to understanding
that in context now the way he says it
is that Republicans are completely aware
of who Trump is and how he talks and how
he acts and we just don't
care that's almost just right he's so
close it's not that we don't
care is that we know he's directionally
correct that's what we care about we
don't care about the specifics we care
about the direction we care about the
energy we care that he cares we care
that he cares and even the hyperbole
shows he
cares so you can't compare those two
things believe it or not according to
outkick um Kid Rock has set up a dinner
between Bill Maher and Trump and himself
so that sometime soon if this reporting
is accurate and it happens uh Bill Mah
and Kid Rock and Trump would sit and
have
dinner now this is after a long period
of mar really disliking Trump you know
on a personal level I think they've had
um they've had personal problems in the
past even before the presidency so a lot
of it is person personal but the one
thing that everybody experiences with
Trump is that if you spend time with him
in person even if you had a bad opinion
of him it's hard to leave with a bad
opinion because he's genuinely really
gifted at dealing with people in person
he's just gifted so he's going to he's
going to really care about what you say
he's going to absolutely listen to you
and you're going to feel that oh he
listened to everything I said like I I
feel like I feel like he's not exactly
what I thought he was people always have
that opinion when they leave him it's
very consistent and I'm wondering what
would
happen I'm not going to predict it will
necessarily happen I I feel there's at
least a 50% chance that maybe it doesn't
happen or it wasn't exactly reported
100% accurately or there was idea that
just won't come together so I don't know
if it's going to happen and but if it
does it's going to be a problem for Bill
M because he's going to have to explain
it to his audience that's already mad at
him for trying to you know find some
kind of a middle
ground and I think it will change how he
would talk about Trump no matter how
much he didn't want it
to so that would be interesting and it I
just love the fact that kid rock of all
people can dial up the president anytime
he
wants he can just call the president say
hey I got an idea and then the president
of the United States the most powerful
politician in the history of the planet
can say what's your idea kidrock well
how about we have this dinner with Bill
Maher it's a pretty good idea why don't
you to set that up that the fact that
that can happen in our world is just so
cool it's just so cool so I hope it does
I wouldn't bet on it but I hope it
does according to the Gateway pundit
there are reports that the US has told
this European allies that it doesn't
plan to be part of future military
exercises in Europe you think that one's
true do you think we've already told
Europe we're not going to be part of
their military
exercises Maybe
you know may maybe it's just part of
trying to convince them to spend more on
themselves but very very possible that
that's
true all right here's where I make some
people mad and the rest of you are going
to learn
something um I have to do my obligatory
uh anti-putin Speech because after that
I'm going to say that he did some really
good persuasion so I'm going to talk
about his persuasion skills which I've
talked about before he's really good at
it like unusually good so you can really
learn something by looking at Putin's
skills but let me do the
obligatory uh Putin speech before I
do uh Putin is a terrible murderous
dictator uh lying and uh he has
Ambitions to conquer the entire world um
you can't trust anything he says he
kills people he puts them in prison he's
the worst person we've ever heard of in
our entire
lives okay we're all on the same page
now now now can I say that he does some
things that are actually impressively
good for
persuasion all right so he gave a
speech uh recently and uh Joe Hof is uh
summarizing this and here's what uh he
said to the
Europeans he he said uh basically he was
telling Europe that pu that Russia has
never been their enemy it's not their
enemy and never hasus been he said
uh um Putin shared that Russia was not
the enemy of Europe and but here's what
he said
specifically um he said quote Russia has
never been and will never be your enemy
now the the has never been part is the
persuasive
part never have been
um he said we do not want European raw
materials and wealth we have our own raw
materials and wealth we absolutely do
not need your raw materials Russia is
the richest country in the world in
terms of raw materials okay that's a
really strong point why do countries
ever conquer other countries because
they want something they either want to
protect their border from NATO or they
want to take advantage of their
resources or they want to I know Rob
them of their wealth
somehow but Putin saying you don't have
anything we
need so so you got this giant you know
NATO military force and Putin saying why
would I even want to like what would be
the reason uh so now for raw
materials he says we do not want your
land or your territory look at how wide
Russia is on the map Russia is twice the
size of the whole of Europe in one place
what would we need your land for what
would we do with it okay that's just
so so
persuasive what would we do with your
land why would we want
it exactly exactly this is a version of
something I've been saying for years
I'll tell you about afterwards he goes
why do you think Russia is an enemy of
Europe what damage has Russia done to
you have we sold you gas and raw
materials at lower prices than the
prices at which your quote friends are
currently selling you
yes and I'm thinking okay that that's
true and then you said did Russia
sacrificed 20 million people in World
War II to get rid of the
Nazis yes he says he's answering his own
questions with yes was Russia the first
country to help Europe during the covid
pandemic why I don't know anything about
that but he says yes he said did we help
Europe when there were fires and natural
disasters yes what has Russia done to
you that you hated so much he said
Russia is not your enemy your real
enemies are your
leaders those who lead
you that is really
persuasive now here's the version that
I've said again I know Putin can't
trusted he's a murderous dictator blah
blah blah blah blah but I've been saying
forever that Russia is a natural Ally to
the United States but I would extend
that to Europe now the the countries
that border on Russia those are a
security concern and in some cases
they're Russians speaking kind of
special cases but the idea that Russia
would want to try to conquer and hold
territory in let's say France or the UK
or it seems a little weirdly crazy to me
that they would even want to do that why
they couldn't hold it it would just be
the end of Russia and they don't need
anything so this is really solid
persuasion and
um again it's worth pointing out because
there are very few people operating at
this level of persuasion compare this to
uh to Canada is uh Justin
Trudeau when Justin Trudeau does his
little speeches they're not
persuasive he doesn't really have that
that Gene but Putin
does anyway um you have you heard about
this gigantic project in Saudi Arabia uh
called neom
neom and it was going to be like this
hundreds long uh hundreds of miles long
futuristic city where the architecture
would be practically magic and you know
they'd build 9 million people would live
there and and I thought to myself holy
cow so Saudi Arabia is just looking to
lap the United States you know they're
they're diversifying away from energy as
their only thing to create a city that
you know anybody want to live there it
just sounded amazing and all the
futuristic things and everything they
were going to do there
uh let's see how that's going total
debacle the cost of overrun by
Fantastical amounts um and I guess the
Crown Prince was asking his people to do
something that was really just wildly
Visionary but not necessarily something
they could know how to
do he he had what's been called a Sci-Fi
inspired dream about uh creating ski
resorts you know indoor ski resorts in
the desert a floating business district
uh um 106 106 mile long pair of empire
state
buildings um basically just the most
impressive urban planning you've ever
seen in your
life and everything appears to be going
wrong and the the uh
the blame for that is being put on the
fact that nobody can tell the boss the
truth apparently if you're the Saudi
Crown Prince and you behead people for
various reasons and you bon saww them
nobody wants want to be the one to say
you
know that sounds good on paper but I
don't know if we can do that at the
budget you want and the time you want so
so basically I'm summarizing in a in a
Dilbert way
so this isn't real but this is what it
feels like um Crown Prince can you build
an anti-gravity luxury hotel that just
sort of hovers employees no problem and
it will only cost
$1,000 we should be done by
Tuesday and then you multiply that by
every part of it it was just people
lying and just saying oh yeah yeah yeah
we could do that and suddenly it looks
like it's going to cost trillions of
dollars way more than Saudi Arabia has
or could have and they've got
Consultants working on it which is
funny uh who are the Consultants
McKenzie and
Company so mcken and Company are the
Consultants on this big project that's
just completely falling
apart now I first met McKenzie and
Company I think I've told you this story
when I worked at the phone company so
one of my you know corporate jobs before
I was a cartoonist and it became one of
the central experiences that created
Dilbert because the the whole consultant
experience is just so otherworldly and
weird that it was just perfect Dilbert
fodder for a long time but let me tell
you my
experience so the McKenzie senior
Executives come in to sell the senior
Executives of the phone company on the
idea that you know they're Geniuses and
they can figure out your strategy better
than your employees can so the idea is
that they're so smart so experienced
that they can just sort of turn around
your company if you follow their advice
but the person who comes in and sells
sells the uh ideas and makes the sale of
okay now our consulting company has been
hired they're not the people who do the
work the people who sell it actually are
pretty brilliant like actually
impressively brilliant or you don't get
in those positions but then they assign
you somebody who is just out of a
business
school and doesn't know anything about
telecommunications and the way they do
their work is they talk to the employees
and they say all right so what would you
do in this
situation and then they figure out a
bunch of numbers and slide decks and
they they put together these impressive
Impressions or impressive presentations
that are basically just a bunch of math
applied to what the employees told them
and then they sell it as you know their
Consulting product and then the
employees like me we'd sit in the
meeting and say well that's just what we
told you that actually is what we've
been telling our bosses for years but
they never listened to us but because it
because but because the ideas from the
employees got laundered through the the
high-end McKenzie and Company
Consultants our senior Executives would
be like finally we know what to
do and then they would put those plans
in place so Pacific Bel doesn't exist
anymore I'm not going to say it's
because of mckian company but I will say
they didn't turn around the business
let's just say um so it got absorbed by
another phone company and absorbed by
another one so it didn't work
out anyway so Saudi Arabia may be no
different than the United States when it
comes to that stuff well the Wall Street
Journal editorial board is talking about
the hoodies in Yemen because they're uh
not only threatening us ships and
they've attacked us ships and uh but
they apparently quite pointedly are not
going to go after a Chinese Iranian or
Russian ships so it does seem named at
us specifically and of course the hoodis
are proxies for
Iran so Iran is causing our shipping
costs to be way higher because the
insurance on the ships is through the
roof
and and on top of that if they want to
take an alternate route Around the Horn
of Africa is way more expensive so part
of this solution for bringing down the
costs in the United States is to stop
the hoodies but as B sason said the
other day on X um we have a sort of a
problem because we've got these $2
million missiles and they've got $2,000
drones and we could pound them all day
long and they would probably just pop
right back up with a few more $2,000
drones Because unless you killed every
single one of
them a few more are going to pop up and
it's not going to cost so much to be
back in business especially with Iran's
help so there's almost no path for us to
fix this or is there because it sounds
like the Wall Street journalist they
don't say it directly but they're kind
of calling on Trump to just
level the
hoodies and I don't know if he can I
don't know if our military even has the
ability anymore um I I have real
questions whether we have the capability
to do anything big that would make a
difference but I'll tell you the only
thing that would matter is total
Destruction and it would have to be so
so bad that the hoodies just said all
right we're never going to get near this
again because we just lost everything so
could Trump do something so big that it
just wipes out the hoodie
everything and the other question I ask
is wasn't it not that long ago that
Saudi Arabia was doing terrible things
to the hoodies and didn't we stop them
from doing
it I might need a little lesson on that
but it seems like we should be able to
unleash Saudi Arabia's military you know
they're closer that they might have a
better way and
just maybe even just let them occupy the
country you know with a little help but
whatever we're doing now can't stand
we can't just the the current situation
is untenable so we're either going to
have to take out Iran seems like a bad
idea or take out the hoodies or occupy
Yemen or something really
expensive and maybe the economics never
work out because if we're trying to
reduce
inflation but we run up a trillion
dollar military Bill to get there well
then we're right back to printing money
so it's not entirely clear there's a
path but if Trump could come up with
something to bomb and some body to bomb
that would make a
difference we might see that might be a
whole bunch of mother of all bombs going
off meanwhile according to the hill uh
Ran's supreme leader has rejected talks
with Trump for any kind of a a deal and
you know I always say think to myself
why wouldn't they do a deal it just
seems so logical why would you want to
be in this permanent military situation
just do a deal you know you we'd be
reasonable we could work on a deal and
then I see uh Iran's
response and it's actually
surprisingly persuasive about why they
don't want to deal so again Iran is evil
you know blah blah they're Liars blah
blah blah I have to say all the bad Iran
things before I can say that they did
anything smart so here's what the uh
supreme leader
said uh about the push for a nuclear
deal um they said that the US's aim is
to exert their dominance and impose what
they
want and it says uh for coercive
governments negotiations are a means to
impose new demands
will definitely not fulfill these new
demands they make new demands meaning
the US they make new demands regarding
the country's defense capabilities and
international capabilities telling us
not to do this do this not to meet with
that person not to go there not to
produce this and to limit the range of
our missiles to a certain extent and
then the lead supreme leader says how
could anyone accepts such
things to which I say oh
yeah
actually if you put any of us in that
same
situation why is some other country
telling them what the hell they could do
in their own
country now of course they extend their
range to affect other countries that we
care about but just think about it it's
not really a negotiation we're asking
for we're saying we want you to do all
these things that we want you to do like
you're not even a sovereign country like
you should just do what we tell you to
do now of course we don't want them to
do what they want to do because they
might build a nuke and threaten Israel
and next thing you know we're in a war
that it's pretty terrible so I can see
why we want them to do different things
than they're doing as in could you
please not build those nuclear weapons
but from Iran's
perspective if you think they're going
to agree to all right here's the deal
you do everything we want and that's it
that's the deal we you do everything we
want and
forever who who in the world's going to
agree to that we're not offering them
anything they can agree to how can you
make a
deal I I mean I'm genuinely curious now
I get that if we threaten them enough
that what they would get in return is
not being
destroyed but that's not really the kind
of deal that other countries want to
take the we we're forcing you to do what
we we want dance for us you know dance
for us do what we want don't meet that
person don't build that
Missle it's not really something you
could expect them to say yes to
ever and I don't know if we could put
enough pressure on them short of just
what bombing the entire country into
Rubble that's not going to
happen so I don't think we have anything
to
offer and and you know Trump is the
master of creating an asset and a
nothing so if he does that asset would
be you know you could you could make
more money your people would be happier
uh you don't have to worry about us
taking you out so he could create some
assets but the way it's being um
presented to them is we'd like you now
to not be a sovereign country and do
what you want we'd like you to do what
we want nobody's going to say yes to
that so I guess uh White House onvoy
Steve wickoff
um is going over there to see if they
can figure out a deal um I guess he's
going to Doha not to Iran but they're
going to try to figure out if they can
figure out a deal I'm not optimistic
about that because it has to be
completely
reframed because the current frame is uh
how would you like to be a and
just do everything we tell you
forever no way they're going to say yes
to that no way so how do you reframe
that into somehow you win we win because
that's how you get a
deal right now it's we win you lose and
that's our that's our only offer we win
you
lose I don't
know according to Mike Johnson speaker
Johnson uh zalinsky did a about face on
mineral deal and uh they think that
eventually that'll get signed you maybe
not right away we might sweat them a
little bit but we'll get that signed um
here's what I would say to speaker
Johnson don't call it in about face and
a about face makes zinsky look like a
chump don't do that like even if you
think it's true that it's just the wrong
phrase an about face an about face makes
it look like I don't know somebody's
weak or indecisive or not a good leader
how about you just say that uh
zelinski's um done what we what we hoped
he would do not what we wanted but what
we hoped and he shown that uh he's
definitely on board for a peace deal
which is what we wanted and now the
situation is all set for maybe working
on a deal
but if you're trying to make something
work don't say stuff like a b face
that's that's just causing trouble that
didn't need to be
caused meanwhile uh Mario Nal is
reporting about this it was in the
financial times but uh he summarizing
for us that uh that apparently the Trump
Administration is trying to work on a
deal with Congo so that we get our own
secure we get our own Supply without
having to go through China that goes
through the
Congo
um I guess that's what it is and I
always wonder is there no way to get
minerals out of the ground
without these poor locals digging
through it with their hands and you know
Barefoot it it just seems like there's
no robot that can do any of that like it
seems like robots would be the answer
right
it's like okay let's build a mine we'll
put some robots there and some safety
standards and then Congo get some
money we get some minerals everybody
wins so I hope there's a way for
everybody to win I I wouldn't be super
happy if all we did was cut China out
but the locals are still scrambling
around with their bare feet and their
hands trying to get these minerals
that's just really really
sketchy um but apparently what we would
offer Congo would be some kind of
military support that I'm sure they
would
like
um so Trump announced on Truth social I
guess on March 7th that he's going to
ban all foreign aid flowing to South
Africa all foreign aid now I don't know
how much that is or how much difference
it makes to South Africa but PGA media
is reporting this and listen to to the
way Trump simplifies this now this is
the thing that drives his critics crazy
that he talks like regular people and
this is the best example of talking like
a regular person that you'll ever see in
your life the the fact that this is
coming from a president is just so
impressive that he that he can you from
the president's office he he can
simplify all the way down to oh I get
that yeah that's just ordinary people
talking so here's what he said on Truth
South Africa is being
terrible okay that that's just the first
part of the first sentence South Africa
is being terrible got it uh plus to
longtime farmers in the country they are
confiscating their land and farms and
much worse than that a bad place to be
right now and we are stopping all
federal funding to go a step further and
any farmer with family from South Africa
seeking to flee that country for reasons
of um safety will be invited into the
United States of America with a rapid
Pathway to
citizenship this process will begin
immediately that is so
clear don't you love the clarity of that
we're ending all all funds because
they're terrible and they're so terrible
that will take the families of the
people who are in deep trouble now the
people the
farmers um I'm going to guess we would
consider highly skilled people because
farming is not easy right and but I
think that the South African Farmers
probably could make the transition to
farming in
America with less trouble than somebody
who'd never been a farmer so they could
bring to America a farming let's say
Revolution uh if there are enough of
them that would make a big difference to
our food prices you know not right away
but say five years
so I like everything about that did you
know that the current law in South
Africa um allows the government to
expropriate which is just take land from
private parties if it's in the public
interest
now that would sound like eminent domain
you know countries do that to build
roads and to build dams and stuff but
that's not what they're talking about
they're just talking about taking it and
apparently if they make an offer and the
farmer let's say a farmer uh says no
that's not
enough then the law allows them to
Simply take it without
compensation do you think they're ever
going to offer enough
why would they all they have to do is
under offer the farmer says no and then
they take it for free why would they
spend money that they don't have to
spend so it looks to me
like it's a bad place to be if you're a
if you're a white farmer in South
Africa well in some technology news is
kind of cool there's an AI
breakthrough um according to venture
beat
that
uh uses a technique called a chain of
draft I guess the researchers for Zoom
Communications came up with this now you
don't need to know what that is so chain
of draft versus uh way the AI is being
done
normally um they can get as good or
better results for as little as 7.6% of
the text required with regular methods
so this is one of those potentially
enormous uh efficiency benefits and we
we keep seeing stories like this where
somebody says well I've got this little
trick this technique that will make an
enormous difference in energy
consumption in this case an enormous
difference
in how how much training or what kind of
training you give it so I guess they I
guess they found out that you if you
fill it with every word which is what
the large language models do uh it's no
better than if you somehow can pick the
words that make a difference I don't
know how they do it but I guess they've
done it in other AI news did you know
that there's a lawsuit from various
authors against meta for meta's um AI it
says that meta was allowed to read all
their books and train on the contents of
the
books and so some authors are suing
Sarah Silverman's one of those uh t
is one of those so they're zoing them
now here's my experience because I've
asked several AIS I haven't asked meta
so I haven't tested metas to see if it's
different but the AIS I've talked to
maybe three of them uh they're aware of
my work meaning that they can explain
some of the key points of my books you
not the Dilbert books but the the ones
that are about persuasion or
you know career self-help stuff and they
do know it they they know what a talent
stack is they know what systems over
goals are and how to explain it they
they understand the keys of persuasion
Etc but when I when I asked the AI did
you read the book were you trained on
the book itself they say no they say no
they were only trained on people's
public comments about the book so they
can look at the review of the book
including extended reviews that would
you know get into the meat of what I
said but they haven't looked at the book
now here's my question to you do you
believe
that you think that's true that they
didn't they didn't train on the
book that they only trained on the
people talking about the book now I will
say that what it knows about the book
does sound a lot more like they only
trained on people who talked about it so
it so it can't answer deep questions
about the internals of the book because
it says I've never seen the
book and it makes me
wonder are the AIS
lying is it possible that they had to
train the AI to say oh I've never seen
the book I just I just know about people
talking about the book now in my case
since I'm a more notorious author there
are always people talking about about
the book so people are going to review
it there you know even on Amazon
there'll be hundreds of reviews so they
could definitely get the basic idea from
my books but if you were a less
reviewed author what would it know about
your book nothing because nobody talked
about it nobody bought
it no so I do wonder if any of them are
trained to lie I'm not going to make
specific accusations but uh all the ones
I tested said they didn't read the
book so maybe it's
true but I haven't I haven't tested meta
so I don't know about that all right
ladies and gentlemen that's what I've
got for you today it's a wonderful
Sunday even if you're a little bit tired
so I think you should go forth and have
an amazing day I'm going to talk to the
uh people on locals privately in a
moment and the rest of you I will see
tomorrow same time same place
for more fun all right locals I'll be
private with you
and
e
e
e for
