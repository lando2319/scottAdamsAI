hey
everybody come on in
it's time that's right it's time for
coffee with scott adams best time of the
day
once again it's quite a run we have here
every single day it's the best part of
the day and no competition
really but all you need to enjoy it is a
copper mug or glass of tanker gels or
styena canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the dope meter of
the day the unparalleled pleasure
sometimes i say that in a different
order it's called the simultaneous up
and it happens now go
ah you know i shouldn't tell you this
little secret but i will
you can determine the quality of the
rest of this broadcast
by whether i can correctly do the
simultaneous sip
uh introduction so
however bad i am on the introduction
that will tell you how sleepy i am
but today i overslept by two hours
you know your body tells you if he needs
sleep
personally i hate sleeping i just hate
sleeping
it feels like being dead when you don't
have to be
because i don't dream or at least i
don't remember my dreams
and it just feels like a timeout i just
it feels like a punishment i hate
sleeping
so every now and then i'll get uh so
sleep deprived that
i'll over sleep by two hours so i did
this morning so i'm a little unprepared
this morning
and i'm sure it will show but you be the
judge
all right we'll get to the slaughter
meter at the end remind me
um do you think all of the planned
october surprises are over
because i think they are don't you if
you had a planned
dirty trick for the election you'd want
to do it before everybody had
uh early voted so i would think that
while there could still be surprises
that's always possible anything that's
left would either be an
organic surprise that was just a weird
coincidence
or it would be some planned surprise
that they couldn't quite get ready in
time
so maybe it's a little late but i would
think they would be pretty careful about
getting those out on time
so what we know now
today might be everything we know
by election day and a lot of people have
voted already of course
so the news that we have is what's baked
in
given now that we can reasonably
confidently not a hundred percent
but reasonably confidently say there
won't be any new
excess hollywood tapes or hillary's
emails
so we probably have what we have
so based on the current situation
who wins donald trump
if nothing changes so remember i told
you the slaughter meter
is never a prediction because so much
would change between the time that i
give the slaughter meter reading
which is an indication of how good
things are for the president
at the moment but i am now revising the
meaning of the slaughter meter because
we're so close to the election
that i think nothing's going to change
and therefore the slaughter meter
is a prediction so as of today the
slaughter meter is a prediction
and it's at 100 trump victory
now we did see that uh trump went to
uh minnesota and so did biden is that
today
or was it yesterday well
if you've got both of them going to
minnesota that tells me that there's
something
kind of big happening in minnesota and
that would suggest that the polling
we're seeing
is completely fraudulent now
do you believe that the polls are
fraudulent
i think they're fraudulent in two
different ways
which is hilarious the entire trick
of the of the pollsters and again this
is me
talking from conspiracy theory land
but i feel pretty confident about this
that the pollsters almost certainly plan
to show
a big democratic victory
but they need to tighten up toward the
vote toward the election
itself because if they don't get closer
to the actual vote by the end
they will be completely discredited so
what the fake polls need
is some kind of an excuse for why they
tightened at the end
they need a hillary's email situation
so something like that but they've also
said
that the the hunter biden email stuff
is a non-story so i think they're going
to have to either
pick that as the reason that the poles
tightened
which would be opposite of what they've
been saying or they're just going to
have a big
unexplained gap there or it's going to
be it's going to tighten too much at the
end
it'll look fake here's why i think they
miscalculated
i think they miscalculated because
they didn't know how many trump
supporters would be lying to pollsters
so here's what i think i think the
actual result would be trump winning
i think the polls have rigged it to make
lit make it look like
biden had a solid a solid victory coming
sort of a suppression poll sort of a
thing and then
on top of that gap that would have
looked maybe
right um is biden really
you know leading by that much it it
looks like a lot
i don't know it's a little hard for me
to accept because it doesn't match with
my observation
but then on top of that you add the shy
trump supporters and it would
you know maybe let's say double the gap
that wasn't real
in the first place so we might have a
double
exaggerated fake gap in the polling
that makes it look hopeless for trump at
the same time biden is going to
minnesota
did i mention biden's going to minnesota
that's got to mean something now
i want somebody who knows more about
politics to fact check me on the
following
suppose hypothetically i don't think
this is the case
so we're just testing a hypothesis and i
might i might pull it back as soon as
you do some fact checking on me
do you think it's possible just
hypothetically if
biden's internal polls showed that he
didn't have a chance
what would he do think about it for a
second
what would you do hypothetically just
hypothetically
if your biden and your internal polls
show
that you can't win you basically have
already lost
how would you act number one
you would certainly avoid crowds because
there's no point in getting coronavirus
right
if you're not even going to be president
so but there's other reasons to avoid
crowds which is just
to be safe and make a good good example
etc
so that doesn't mean anything by itself
the other thing you would do
is you would barely you would barely
campaign in other words you would reduce
your schedule to
something bare bones but again that
doesn't mean that's what's happening
because there would be another reason
for that which is that biden
you know may not be energetic enough to
do a lot of campaigning
or the other possibility is they think
they have it won so they don't need to
do so much campaigning why put yourself
at risk
but here's the part i want you to fact
check the other thing you would do
is you would leave your limited
campaigning
wait for it your limited campaigning
that you did do
would be in a state where the senate
race is close
because if you believe that you couldn't
win the presidency
but you still had to pretend you were
trying
what would you do you cut your schedule
way back
and the only ones you would do are where
there's maybe a senate benefit
because you've already lost the
presidency
so do a fact jack he was in where
atlanta
and he's in minnesota do they both have
close
uh senate races that's the part i don't
i don't keep up with that stuff
so fact check that if the places that
biden has been campaigning lately
do not seem like the kind of place that
a president would need to campaign
but it looks like it would be useful for
the senate races
that might be a little bit of an
indication that the biden
side their internal polling shows that
they're going to lose badly
and they might as well get some senators
because at least if you could hold the
senate
well then you'd have something now i ask
you this
do you think that if these hypothetical
shy trump supporters exist do you think
that the way they are lying to pollsters
is like this uh hello i'm a pollster
who are you voting for for president uh
and then you're gonna lie
you're like okay watch this biden
yeah i'm for biden and then the next
question they ask you is
who are you going to vote for for senate
the republican or the democrat
and you're thinking to yourself oh
he's going to catch me
because pretty much nobody i mean
somebody does but
almost nobody is going to vote for
different parties
for their senator and the president it
happens
but it's not going to happen a lot so if
you're a liar
and you're trying to lie to the pollster
are you going to say that you're going
to vote for the republican senator
and then tell the pollster that you're
voting for a democrat for president
i don't think so now i'd have to ask you
because a lot of people have said they
have lied to pollsters even this year so
so you tell me if you were asked both of
those
questions wouldn't you lie on both of
them
wouldn't you i would think that you
would
so it could look like the republicans
are going to lose
lose the senate that's what it looks
like at the moment so if you believe the
polls
the republic the republicans are going
to lose the presidency the senate
the house by even more more people
and then they'll uh pack the courts
maybe and own the entire government
that's what the polls say but
it doesn't feel like that does it check
your head
and then check your body do they say the
same thing
because your head says well the polls
they probably fixed this since
hillary's run so like they're not going
to be that far off this time
is that what's happening i don't know
my my brain sees the poles and i get it
i get it i mean i see them
but my body says trump already won
and this will be a real good test of
intuition in fact you should do the same
thing
do a do a let's say a survey of your
body
and a survey of your own brain do they
feel differently
what does your body feel like do you
feel like trump won
already if you're you're sitting in the
future imagine yourself in the future
and you can imagine a president trump
let me ask you this
is it hard to imagine
a president biden because it is for me
i mean i can do it if i if i try
but i have trouble even really imagining
it
and in the past that's that seems to be
correlated
i haven't done a rigorous you know
randomized controlled test
but i feel as though when my body has
made a decision is usually right
so we'll see now suppose i'm wrong
could happen anything could happen
stranger things have happened
um are you guys going to be okay
are you guys going to survive if uh if
it goes the other way
will you be mentally disrupt
well i'll be financially disrupt
apparently i would be taxed at a rate of
something like
67 my
estate would be pretty much given to the
government
or the half of it i guess and everything
i've invested and worked for
all of my life would be reduced below
the point uh
that certainly i thought it would be in
other words it would substantially
change my
my lifestyle uh is your life going to be
substantially changed
by a biden presidency because i don't
know if you were a
you know if you're a democrat another
term of trump isn't going to change your
life that much
unless it just gets better the economy
gets better
but a biden presidency would almost
force me out of the state
and maybe out of the country because
you know if you ask me right now i'd say
there's no way i'm going to leave the
country
and i guess you would have to renounce
your citizenship if you did
because otherwise you're going to pay
taxes
i think that's how it works but i am now
when i look at biden's tax plans
i'm not one of those celebrities who
says if the other side wins i'm going to
move to canada
i wouldn't do it on principle i would do
it purely on financial
financial basis because i could work in
other places
so i would dead serious there's no
hyperbole here
i mean obviously i'd have to talk to
christina
but uh i'd have to think really
seriously
about finding a better country you know
with better taxes primarily with better
taxes we'll see
but i don't think that's going to happen
um don lemon says that he had to get rid
of his uh
trump supporting friends he said quote
last night
i just had to get rid of a lot of people
in my life because sometimes you have to
let them go
i think you have to hit rock bottom like
an addict
that's what don lemon thinks of trump
supporters
that he can't even you can't even be
friends with him
that is really bad now on top of that
add that biden is running
a hitler ad for a campaign ad
can i have a little permission here for
some cursing
i'm going to give you a little bit
warning
that there probably will be some pretty
violent
cursing coming up pretty quickly see if
you've got some kids in the room
send them out send them out
because here's the thing you know i
don't mind a good hard-fought campaign
and
even though it bugs me when there are
lies you know the lies are part of the
political
process and you know it vexes you but it
doesn't bother you that much
joe biden in the closing moments of the
campaign before he could maybe
become president of the united states is
labeling trump's supporters because he's
labeling trump this
it really means the supporters do as
nazis
have you ever have you ever seen
anything like this
now he might if you asked him he might
say no no no i'm not talking about the
voters
who support him i'm talking about it's
obvious to everyone
this would be biden speaking it's
obvious to everyone that
trump is basically the next hitler so
that's not saying something
bad about the supporters it is
you can't separate those right now
um biden is calling almost all of you
nazis
and i don't think that's an exaggeration
now it's
it's the season of exaggeration but i
don't believe
that as an exaggeration i believe that
biden has
actually said that trump supporters are
nazis
in that ad i don't know any other way to
interpret that and i'm being serious
i'm not i'm not just playing politics
now this is sort of personal
this isn't really political
and so i would like on behalf of all of
you
potential trump supporters who are
listening to this to say this
 you joe biden you
you bastard
you don't deserve to be president for
doing this
i don't care whatever the else you
did
in your whole goddamn life
i don't care what a good service you did
i don't care that you're other people
say you're nice
for doing this just this and nothing
else
you're dead to me and i will do
anything i can
if you become president to destroy you
i will make it my mission
to get you out of politics i'll make you
sound like it's not violent
because it's not i will make it my
mission
to bring down your whole family
legally of course in all the ways that
are appropriate
in political discourse but this isn't
politics
all right the nazi ad you've crossed the
 line
this is not politics this is personal
i won't act the same when it's personal
as i would if i'm just watching a show
all right
you have crossed the line you
you were an from the start joe
biden
and now you've revealed your complete
level of assholery
this is unacceptable it's
unacceptable for a candidate
for president it's unacceptable if you
if
god forbid you made it to the presidency
but this is unacceptable
to be a human being to be
a human being you not only
didn't qualify to be the
president
you're not qualified to be a
human
 being you don't run
nazi goddamn commercials
about your fellow citizens that's it
you
all right there's nothing i've seen in
politics
as bad as this nothing i haven't seen
one thing it's as bad as what we
just saw with that
that hitler commercial this guy is a
menace
he wants to divide the country like
nobody's ever divided the country
look at what trump's doing this week
he's
gaining support from african americans
getting
i think even little wayne said he was he
was going to support the president
now you've seen you know i wouldn't say
ice keep as a supporter of the president
nor would i say
50 cent but they're certainly
trump friendly i mean even kanye west is
supporting kanye west for president
but he's at least trump friendly right
trump curious
so look at the real world joe
biden
look at the real world in the real world
all these people that you're trying to
bamboozle with your
malarkey they're not buying it
and the fact that you would actually
 try this
at this late stage is the most
despicable thing i've ever seen
from a human being so let's
let's dispense with any thought
that you're a good person joe biden
you're not a good person
you're a really bad person indeed
i don't know anybody who's worse than
you try to figure out one thing
short of actually killing somebody
and i i think that commercial could end
up killing people
you and your little douchebag
mask joe biden
because you care so much about the
 population of the united states
and our citizens
yeah wear your little douchebag
mask which by the way masks are good
you should wear your mask but then run a
nazi commercial
really are you trying to tell us that
you care about the public
you don't care about the public
you wouldn't run that commercial
you goddamn piece of
i know you don't like it when i use the
lord's name in vain
but it just comes out i apologize
all right enough on that um
so here's how the left makes the hunter
biden
email scandal go away and it's really
sort of a
it's sort of amazing to watch it happen
because lots of times you say to
yourself hey i wonder if the media is
trying to manipulate people
and you're never really sure you think
well
is that the way they just think the
story should be told
is this just individuals putting their
interpretation on things or is there
really like a scandal going on are they
actually manipulating the public
well let me give you an example here's
how
democrats have made this story disappear
the first thing they say is
i guess the wall street journal said
they couldn't verify the story
and then other people said oh well we
can't verify the story so therefore we
won't talk about it
because it's not verified and then they
act as though
that is some kind of a standard that
they've ever used before
now if you're the public and you're sort
of a low
low information consumer of the news
you might see that you might say to
yourself oh that's a pretty good
standard
if something isn't verified why would
you put it on the news
well the reason is because every other
 part of the news is unverified
in election year it's all unverified
every one of those anonymous
books
they're all unverified and anonymous
sources
unverified has never has
never meant you don't put it on
television it never meant that and it
never will
and yet with straight faces lots and
lots of
pundits have said and news people it
wasn't verified
wasn't verified now here's the second
trick so first you say it's not verified
because you don't try how hard would it
have been
to talk to tony bobilinski an eyewitness
who verified the emails
how hard would it be to talk to somebody
who had them
jack bassabek i think had had some
materials
bannon had him and he and all of them
would love the press to see them
right the people who had the materials
weren't hiding them they were trying to
get them
into the public so if you couldn't
verify
that with a witness who was very
credible
all the forensics all access to it if
you couldn't verify that
on top of the fact that the family
itself is not declining to
is not saying they're fake if you can't
find a biden to say
well let me ask you specifically are you
saying these emails are not real
if you can't do that little bit of
verifying
obviously you're not trying right um
it's it was like uh do you remember in
charlottesville when people were arguing
about
um who was there you know were there any
people who were there
were non-racists but were there just to
support statues
did you ever see any reporting on that
i think the the new york times asked a
few people
that day and they had you know some
mention of that
otherwise the rest of the media didn't
do that little bit of verifying that
they would need which is
oh maybe we should just talk to some
people who were at charlottesville
and see if indeed there were some people
there who would
consider themselves non-racist who do
who disavowed the racists who were there
who were there just for their own
reasons did they exist
i did that i just tweeted hey was
anybody there i'll talk to you
they contacted me and i talked to him
how hard was it
for me to verify that the president was
correct when he said there were some
people there
who were not with the nazis and just
were there about the statues
how hard was that it wasn't
i tweeted it that's it i just tweeted
hey anybody out there and they contacted
me
so this is how hard it would have been
to verify the hunter
laptop story just make a phone call
basically and so the public says well if
they didn't verify it it must be because
it couldn't be verified
and that's just not true so they just
don't talk about whether it could have
been verified
they'd just say they didn't
i think they might have said that they
couldn't but that was obviously a lie if
they said couldn't
then here's the the next phase
then they start doing stories about how
the people on the right
are pushing a fake story right so this
is
this is the dirt on top of the hole so
the hole
is can't be verified what do you do
verify it and then and then on top of
that
they run the stories about how the other
side's pushing a room you know an
unverified
piece of garbage story and that's like
the dirt on top of the hole
you know after they buried the the
consumer
and and then this last
the last phase you're seeing today is
uh cnn called it
the scandal by proxy and there's an
article on that in which they say the
proxy meaning
the hunter biden is not joe biden and
it's a scandal about hunter biden
therefore should joe biden be
a captive of some rumor about a whole
other person
i mean these are different people hunter
biden is not running for president
right right so it's irrelevant
right according to cnn
but that's not the story that's not the
story
twenty dollars john you're way too nice
thank you
the story the story is that
joe biden was part of the deal
and that he was cut in for some of it
now that could be true or not true
but the way they say they they checked
it was to check his actual legal records
his tax returns and his
financial statements and they say it's
not on there because that's the way you
do crime
you put it right on your taxes no
and the public is like well i guess they
looked at the financial records so
i guess we're done here
no do you think al capone went to jail
because of his financial records well i
don't actually i don't know
bad analogy forget that analogy maybe he
did
but certainly if you look in the wrong
place
you're not going to find the thing
you're looking for if you know you're
looking in the wrong place
when you lose your keys in your house
do you ever dig a hole in your lawn to
look for them
no no you don't because even though your
keys are lost
they're not in a hole in your lawn
so you don't go digging digging looking
for them because that's not where they
might be
what you do is you might look through
your pants pockets and your
your surfaces in your house because
that's where they might be
you look for things where they might be
you don't look for things where
you know they're not going to be such as
on your tax returns
you you are all too nice um so this last
play is that what hunter does doesn't
have any bearing on joe biden
but the whole story is about blackmail
do you think that if china had the goods
to put hunter biden in jail
in jail do you think that joe biden
would not have to act differently to
keep hunter biden in jail
you don't think that that would be
blackmail material if hunter biden had a
whole bunch of scandalous
activities that china knows about but we
don't
that wouldn't be a problem how is that
not a story
so the so here's the play so let me
break it down
play number one they just ignore the
story just
just don't don't cover it but then
there's too much noise from the other
side and
and uh if if trump mentions it a bunch
of times if he tweets
you can't ignore it anymore so the so
the people on the right you know
battered through and got through the
first line of defense which is they just
ignore it
then they do the fake verification thing
where they act like they can't verify
something that's easy to verify
and then they say we couldn't find the
crime because they looked in the wrong
place
we know they looked in the wrong place
that's not a gas
you don't find bribes on somebody's tax
returns
and then they turn it into a story about
the right
having you know yet again some you know
q anon
kind of a situation so they make it
sound like it's
just those crazy conservatives with
their
you know conspiracy theories try it
again
and then they turn it into well it's
hunter it's not even the president
or the potential president so that's the
play
and i wonder if we'll see this play
again on other inconvenient
news items but that's how they
disappeared it
well let's see what else we got here oh
and
what about the uh super v recovery that
we're having
so yesterday was a gigantic
kind of a deal because the
the the economy is surging back not only
is our
economy coming back at record rates
and of course it's coming back from a
low base as i talked about yesterday
but it's still quite notable because
we're apparently
at least according to some reporting our
economy
suffered less and is coming back faster
than a lot of competing economies which
is a pretty big deal
so that was a gigantic news wasn't it i
mean what's bigger than the economy
is surging back pretty big news
that wasn't covered in any way on cnn or
msnbc last night in any way
wasn't even mentioned uh in the evening
in the evening shows it might have been
mentioned during the day
but in the evening shows they get all
the viewership
was not mentioned that the president
probably is making the right decisions
for the economy
now you could argue whether it's the
right decision overall that would be
what we're talking about but you can't
argue
that he didn't tell you this is what i'm
gonna do
and then he did it i mean he would
basically use babe ruth pointing to the
you know the the wall and saying that
i'm gonna hit my next home run
over that wall over there and then he
hits it over the wall
right in front of you that's sort of
what trump did
he said i'm going to you know i want to
get back and reopen stuff
we're going to have a super v it'll be
the most impressive recovery
you've ever seen and then he did exactly
that
now was that reckless and dangerous and
should we wear masks more and
could he have done better to keep the
infections down probably
but that's exactly what he told you he
was doing
he said i'm do it effectively he said
i'm going to take a little extra lit
risk on the the health element
and the purpose of that is to make sure
that our economy is strong
because if we don't make that strong
it's going to have
you know a secondary effect on your
health so you have to look at it as a
big ball of connected stuff
and here here's where i as a leader i
think the risk reward makes the most
sense
little extra risk on the on the virus
but a little uh extra success on the
economy
because that's keeping you alive too
i think the president pointed to the
fence and hit
hit a home run over the fence babe ruth
style
and msnbc and cnn decided that wasn't
news
are you kidding me that's the
definition of news
can you imagine if somebody else
had pulled that off points to the fence
call calls the next pitch a home run and
then hits it over the
that fence and it's not news it's the
president
if the president did anything like that
it doesn't matter if it's the economy
if he did anything that specific of
saying there's the fence i'm going to be
hitting the ball over that fence
and then he did it it wouldn't matter
what the topic was
that's freaking news not on msc nbc
all right uh you know uh
is it jeff greenwald for the who
until yesterday i guess worked for the
intercept he was one of the
founders he had to quit because quote
the intercepts
editors in violation of my contract this
is greenwald's contract
of editorial freedom censored an article
i wrote this week
refusing to publish it unless i remove
all of the sections
critical of democratic presidential
candidate
joe biden can you believe this
he co-founded the freaking publication
and had a contract to give him editorial
freedom
and and
what he said was true
keep in mind that there's no part of
this story
where they're accusing him of having
inaccurate information
it's i'm sorry it's glenn glenn
greenwald not
jeff uh so glenn greenwald
which is embarrassing because i'm
actually a huge fan of
greenwaldt i think his personality is a
little
uh let's say a little prickly
i i don't think i would ever be friends
with glenn greenwald
because he's sort of an unpleasant
character
but damn he's good at his job i gotta
say that and his
his tweets and his writing are just some
of the best on the internet
hands down so you should follow him um
not jeff glenn greenwald all right
but the the enormity of this the fact
that he
he had to quit his own publication that
he co-founded
because they wouldn't let him write the
truth again
i don't think anybody's arguing whether
the things he was saying were true or
false
they were not asking him to remove it
because it wasn't true
they were asking him to remove it
because it was
bad for joe biden i mean
this is amazing that this is happening
in front of us
and we're sort of i always say we're
okay with it but we're not
acting on it in some way now maybe the
vote itself will be how we act on it
um i was watching uh
bill gates uh in a little clip talking
about the
vaccines that are coming and this is
because
if you didn't watch it uh and i was
really surprised by this but joe rogan
had um i'm sorry i'm
so tired this morning i'm blanking on uh
tell me who joe rogan just had on the
show
uh the provocative uh
not kanye i'm just waiting for your
comments here
why the hell can't i think of it
this is weird i'm having a total uh
joe biden moment
who is the very famous person who got
banned from
uh all the social media networks and uh
removed from spotify on joe rogan
has his own show why is it taking you
alex jones thank you
why did it take you so long to remind me
his name all right so joe rogan had
alex jones on his show now this is a big
deal
in and of itself because alex jones was
you know banned on various platforms
but notably when joe rogan got his big
spotify deal
there were rumbles that his old shows
that included alex jones and i think
some other people were removed
from the catalog because the spotify
employees didn't like the content
so what does joe rogan do when the whole
world is mad at him for
both sides or bad but for different
reasons one side's mad that he ever
talked to
alex jones in the first place the other
side is mad
that he's going someplace spotify that
would make him get rid of an alex jones
episode so he was right in the middle
of not satisfying anybody on the left or
anybody on the right
and thank you for all telling me his
name alex jones
and by the way alex i apologize it's not
like i don't know your name
you know we've been on the show several
times
uh and i'm a fan of alex jones he's
he's pretty impressive for what he does
and nobody's nobody's hiding the fact
that he's
done some things that he needs to answer
to and i don't
so that's for him to answer to but in
terms of his talent it's pretty
impressive i gotta say alex jones is not
famous by accident he's famous because
he puts on a hell of a show
so i had been i've been tipped off
that rogan talking to alex jones was
going to be entertaining
and it really was i'm not done watching
it yet i think i watched the first
hour but i got to say you can't get much
more entertaining
than joe rogan talking to alex jones
when he's not supposed to because it's
the not supposed to part that added the
secret sauce
and i thought to myself joe rogan
you're getting you're getting on by
the entire world
for talking to having ever talked to
alex jones
so what does joe rogan do he invites
alex jones on the show
what a baller play that was and i said
to myself
i don't know if this is going to work
out for you joe it's a bold play
definitely it's definitely what i'd call
the football decision
you know it's the it's the decision to
run toward the brick wall and run
through it
instead of to climb over it or walk
around it
and apparently i mean just judging on
the outcome
it looks like joe rogan said somebody
built a
giant brick wall directly in front of me
i think i'm going to just bust right
through the wall
and so he has alex jones on the show
which i thought was terrific both in
entertainment value and in just you know
wait
a way to run your life if you will
and what joe did to protect himself
and i thought this was also quite
brilliant is he would
keep interrupting uh alex jones who
would go on
a rant that would have lots of uh
alleged
facts in it that maybe you had never
heard before
and so joe rogan kept saying wait wait
wait wait hold on
back up you just said whatever it was
some claim that you've never heard
before in your entire life unless you
watch
alex jones show i guess and then alex
would say that's right
and he'd make his outrageous claim and
then
they would fact check it by googling it
right there
and uh joe rogan's assistant would put
it up on the
on the video and sure enough this
outrageous thing that alex jones said
that maybe you've never even heard of
before turns out to be in the news
from with a respected news source and
and you say
oh okay all right well there was one
alex jones got one right all right well
but you know the other stuff he says is
obviously crazy
so then alex jones starts talking again
he'll make another outrageous claim
and joe rogan would stop him again hold
on hold on
all right we can't go past that
let's back up to that wild claim you
made
put it on the screen oh that one's true
too
and watching that watching that series
play out
over and over again they kept
fact-checking him and it kept being true
it was kind of amazing and again you
know
i don't want to over pro over praise
joe rogan because it just sounds too
much a fan
fan thing but between his kanye episode
which was just amazing
and the the alex jones episode
this is as good as it gets for that form
of entertainment i mean i think he's
just
you know i i thought he had defined the
space already but he just
he just widened that space a little bit
and i didn't even think that was
possible so good good job there anyway
one of the things that came out of that
was the thought that these vaccines
have side effects the ones that are
being
prepared right now now do you ever heard
that story
had you ever heard that the vaccines
that are being prepared right now which
we have
we're getting good reports in terms of
the probable efficacy
had you heard that they had side effects
so
i see this clip of uh rogan
tweet uh sent this out on instagram at
least might have been on twitter
too and on instagram i see a clip of
bill gates being interviewed about the
vaccines
and he he lets out that getting the
vaccine
can cause you a lot of pain
have you ever heard that before because
regular
vaccinations don't cause you a lot of
pain i think
maybe some people you know some and
maybe you've never even heard of anybody
who had
had pain because of it but apparently
these vaccinations are going to hurt you
as they stand they all have a side
effect
it's kind of bad at least in the sense
that it hurts for a while
so that's from bill gates i don't know
how universal that is
i don't know if that's every vaccine but
then he adds this
that they almost certainly would have to
be given in multiple doses
meaning you'd have to get a little and
then your body adjusts
and then you go back and you get another
one how many of these do you need
two or three and then how long does it
last
so i've got a feeling that vaccinations
are not going to be
quite as awesome as we hoped they would
be
because a lot of people are not going to
get it if it hurts
and it hurts a lot that's the indication
we're getting that it might be that
and i think it hurts if you give the
full dose because it has to be a pretty
big dose
compared to other vaccines and how many
people are going to go back for their
second and third
shot if the first one is unpleasant
that is a lot of friction
because if the whole if the whole
process were pain-free and easy and you
only had to do it once
it's still gonna get it's still hard to
get people to do it
but then you add any of that extra
friction of it's inconvenient and it
might hurt
a lot of people are going to skip that
somebody says why
pain and i don't know i i don't know the
answer to that
medically why pain it's the first i'd
heard it but i think you've got to
factor that into your predictions about
how important the the vaccines are going
to be
now on the other side i was watching a
doctor on twitter
talk about all the different therapies
and drugs that they have
now and how for each phase of the
progression of covet
they've got now you know one or two
different therapies
a lot of them are just existing drugs
that they found work pretty well
some of them are you know your regeneron
etc
and what i'd like to know is how
different
are the treatment regimens across
states in other words if i go into a
hospital in california
am i going to get the same drugs that i
would get in florida
or new york does anybody know
has the treatment let's say recommended
treatment
gotten to the point where wherever you
are in the country or even anywhere in
the world
you're going to get the same treatment
well i think the answer is
no because there are meds that are not
available everywhere
including the regeneron which is in
short supply
so wouldn't you like a whole lot more
visibility
on what hospitals are treating with what
regimens
and then what results they're getting
wouldn't you like to know and i i hope
somebody's studying this it's the
obvious thing to study
wouldn't you like to know if there's
let's say a big hospital center
in l.a that has a certain outcome you
know a certain number of people are
surviving
and let's say that they're using mostly
the same kind of
treatment schedule and then compare that
to another state where maybe they have
less access to drugs are they treated
differently do you get the same death
death rate by now there must be enough
people going through the system that we
could tell
all right um somebody's saying that the
vaccinations will hurt
because they're slipping in a chip
it's the chip that hurts when they chip
you that's not true
it's not true as far as i know all right
um somebody says he's divorced
so he doesn't feel pain anymore
it must have been quite a marriage um
over in germany the germans are having a
another outbreak another
little surge in the coronavirus and so
they're doing a little more shutdowns
now didn't you think that germany was
done because germany did everything
right
right they've got that good leadership
modern economy so germany won't have any
problem they just have to
they get a little up uptick so they're
just going to close down again and
here's
here's a little bit that i picked up
that i thought was
interesting so the question is now
whether the germans
will do what they're told but did they
do what they were told the first time
in other words did germany have good
compliance with masks
and with social distancing well it turns
out that the germans are very compliant
people
according to this news story and that
the germans actually were
very disciplined that's the phrase used
very disciplined
and that they did actually reduce their
contacts quite a bit
and wore masks so here's what's
kind of interesting about this not in a
good way because you don't want them to
have extra infections
but i feel like we're going to learn a
lot from whatever happens in germany
in the next month because the germans
are re-shutting down
and we know that they have a good
history of compliance
they'll probably have a good history of
compliance after this
is done too because i think that they
just
are maybe culturally they're more likely
to
you know follow directions from above
both good and bad i suppose
so we're going to really know something
i think i think we're going to see if
the german
method just squashes the infections
or if the infections just keep going up
because leadership
doesn't matter that's what we'll find
out
you're going to find out in germany if
masks and social distancing
matter because germany now we have the
the first wave where it seems to have
worked
and now the second wave we're going to
learn if it works in a way when we're
really watching it
right in theory the germans will put
their masks back
on they'll stop larger gatherings and
restaurants and stuff
and in three weeks you're going to see
that curve
dip way down because that's what
happened before
and they know how to do it so what
happens if that doesn't happen
anybody want to put on their their best
predictions
do you predict that the germans who have
good leadership good compliance from the
public
plenty of masks they don't have any kind
of a shortage of masks clear
instructions
and their i guess their guidelines are
going to be quite specific about how
many people can be together in what
situations
under all those conditions do you expect
to see that curve just go around
and dip down or if leadership
and those steps are not as big a deal as
you have been told you would see
infections go up
does anybody want to put their bets on
this
all of the all of those those of you who
have said
that the masks and the social distancing
don't make that much difference
are you willing to bet that germany will
have
no success in
in stopping this second surge is that
your bet
everybody this is your chance because
even though this is not a randomized
controlled study
it's germany it's predictable you kind
of know what you're going to get with
germany
right so this would be a good one to bet
on
i'm going to bet that it works
so i'll put my bet down my bet
is that they they will flatten it i
don't know
if it'll be that different from the rest
of the world so you still have to
compare it to something
if there's somebody who didn't do
anything and they still got the same
curve
you know you're gonna have to compare
that
you you're being very nice with these uh
with these super chats thank you so much
i do see them as they go by i just don't
talk about them all um
all right on another topic kanye made a
full-sized hologram
for kim kardashian of kim's uh deceased
father and it's one of those you know
life-size
walking talking i don't know how much
walking he did but it's standing there
a hologram and it's got a voice and it's
interacting and it's
it's talking to kim and i had two
feelings about that
one that certainly makes
what you were gonna get for your spouse
look kind of pathetic doesn't it
because you were gonna get a box of
candy and a a nice card
kanye made a hologram of her deceased
father so he beat you
in the gift-giving um but
i don't know if i would have wanted to
see that actually
i suppose it depends who you are and who
your parent was
i'm not sure i could handle seeing a
deceased
relative come back as a hologram i don't
know
i guess i would like it i would i would
do it of course
i wouldn't say no to it but
i wonder if we're reaching the point
where you add a little artificial
intelligence to the hologram
and we just have a blended society where
we're living
with holograms who are intelligent and
you know interact with your room because
i think we'll have the technology pretty
soon
where that hologram can walk from room
to room within your home
you know you just have sensors and
holographic
projectors in each room and your
your deceased family member can just
live in your house again
can walk around talk to you ask you how
the weather's going
that's a real thing and i think that
that could happen maybe even faster
because the holographic projection stuff
got really good recently i mean really
good recently
so i think you're going to have that
before robots
so before you have a lifelike looking
robot that looks like a person
that could say live in your house and be
your domestic servant
you're going to have relatives who have
been reanimated
just living in your house take me for
example if you haven't heard me talk
about this before
one of the reasons that i enjoy putting
so much of my opinion
on the internet which is all of these
live streams
plus everything i write everything i
tweet every book i've written
my personality is more more
fully um displayed in a way that anybody
could access it you could just google me
and you could find my entire personality
my opinion on just about everything
somewhere
and you could use that to build an ai of
me
and i authorize the future world anybody
who wants to build a version of me
you know a robot or an ai
i hereby authorize it in public so you
can build as many as you want
and you can use you can use me as the
personality for that that's authorized
i think i'll be one of those people i
think i will be a hologram that
walks the earth forever so look forward
to that
apparently there's a facebook group
group called wives of the deplorables
these are wives who are
voting for biden but their husbands are
voting for trump
do you think they have a chance do you
think that the
wives of the deplorables are still going
to be married in
five years i don't know it feels like a
bad sign
i feel like that's not going to make it
the distance um
now birdie and elizabeth warren
are both looking at maybe cabinet
positions if biden wins
and warren might be looking at secretary
of treasury these are all rumors you
don't really know what they want
and maybe bernie would be secretary of
commerce or something
so we're we're on the border of
67 tax rate
and a full socialist cabinet
so got that and almost 80
of the tax increases backed by biden
would land on the top
one percent of earners according to you
know
uh warden i guess and
i'm thinking to myself that's terrific
but i would leave the country
if this really happens honest to god
i don't know if i could live in this
country i really
want to it's my first choice by far
but i really really want biden not to
tax me
at 67 percent and essentially
you know remove most of my net worth
let me tell you why this matters this is
way too man
this might be a little too personal but
i'll give you a sense of it
it had always been my ambition to not
die rich because if you die rich
i think you're an idiot because dying
rich
means that you made all this money and
you didn't use it
like what would be the point of dying
rich
that would be like a sign of failure now
if you have you know a spouse and kids
and stuff of course
you want them to have something to
inherit but you don't want to be
just take your money to your grave and
so i have lived my life
let's say generously thinking that
thinking you know if i want to go to my
old age with a certain amount of money
so that i'll be comfortable
i want that but all of this extra stuff
that's beyond the amount that i would
need to be as comfortable as i want to
be
i kind of wanted to get rid of it and so
i did
so for much of my life i have spent as
much
time giving away my money
as i have making it because i didn't
want to have
too much money dying as a billionaire to
me seems like the ultimate loser play
you should just give it away because
there are people who need it more
now my strategy has worked and if
my career you know as it's widening down
in my older years
and as i project you know what will i
need for my retirement and you know my
family etc
i've planned that under the current tax
rates and current system
i'll be fine just the way it is
joe biden has decided to take
two-thirds of that so now i'm in a
situation where
the generosity of my life to this point
now will basically be very damaging to
me in my older years i'll have to
actually
i would have to dramatically alter my
lifestyle
because i was too generous in earlier
years
and i would actually not have enough
left to maintain the lifestyle the style
that i have
so there is an unfairness to it
that none of you care about whatsoever
because you know it's
problems of rich people let's let's be
honest nobody
really cares if a rich person loses a
little money it's not anybody's problem
but it is a little personal because in
economics there's a concept that
it doesn't matter what the rules are you
just don't want to change them
because the people playing the economic
game in other words what
what businesses they start what types of
jobs they do
it's based on those rules and so i've
i've developed an entire life based on a
set of
rules essentially tax rules
that would get me to my end point the
way i wanted and then
if they changed the rules i can't get
there
only because they changed the rules i
did everything right
should i be punished for doing
everything right
being generous over the course of my
lifetime
and still thinking well i just want
enough you know that i still have a
you know good solid comfortable life and
then they change those rules and say
we're going to take
two-thirds of your money and just give
it to other people is that fair does
that seem fair to you
i would say that would be very unfair
but again nobody has sympathy for
wealthy people i don't expect it
i'm just telling you how i feel i don't
ask you to have any
sympathy for that whatsoever
and that is my program for today
i hope you enjoyed it moved to texas
well moving to texas would only help me
with my
state taxes it would help a lot
but it wouldn't help me with the estate
taxes it would help with
state but not estate all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you tomorrow
