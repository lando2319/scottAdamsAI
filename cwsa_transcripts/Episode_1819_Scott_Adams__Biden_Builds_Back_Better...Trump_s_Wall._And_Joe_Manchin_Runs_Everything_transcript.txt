good morning everybody and welcome
to the best day you've ever had in your
entire life the highlight of
civilization the best part of the
morning the dopamine day of the day the
thing that makes your oxytocin
rock
yeah it's coffee with scott adams
same time same place every day and all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tank or shelves it's time to campaign
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
so i don't have sound on the uh
hold on
hold on
i can fix that i can fix that
[Applause]
how about if i plug in the microphone
does that help
is anybody happy is anybody happier with
the microphone actually plugged in
well here's something you should learn
about setting up your podcast studio
you can never have a podcast studio in
which any part of it ever changes the
minute you use your ipad for any other
purpose which is what i did i use my
ipad for something else for a minute
you forget to put it back the way it was
so that is your lesson for the day
but
i don't believe we did the simultaneous
sip yet i think we don't want to skip
that
and now
back to where we were
are we back back to where we were back
on track okay simultaneously go
oh
oh that's good
i don't know i think it was the waiting
for it that made it extra good
well i don't know if you heard but
there's some movement to rename monkey
box
monkey box
i think some people think it's racist
sounding or something i don't know
but we're going to rename it
and some of you may have seen that
tucker carlson had a
suggestion for it i believe it's based
on the fact that there is some
suggestion
by the way is this confirmed
i keep saying on twitter
but not in the regular news
that is primarily being spread by gay
sex
is that is that just a twitter thing or
is that actually
is the medical community saying that
because it seems like twitter says it a
lot
but i don't see it at all in the regular
press
is the press trying to downplay the fact
that it's
primarily spread that that way
well thankfully we have tucker carlson
to
set us straight because his suggestion
for renaming monkey pox was
long covet
schlong covert
now you may say
scott that is somewhat offensive
possibly homophobic
to which i say well don't blame me blame
tucker carlson
i will simply point out that it's clever
now let me ask you this
can we not carve out
a special category of humor
for things which you know are wrong
but they're funny anyway
is that something we can't do
can't we say yeah i get that that's
that's insulting to some group or group
of people
but what if it's really funny
isn't that okay still
because i try to use the same standard
for other people that i would use for
myself
if somebody walks up to me and says
you're bald
i'll say well let's offensive
but if they say you look like a thumb
i say it's kind of funny i do look like
a thug with glasses that's kind of funny
if it's funny it's funny
is there no way we can come together on
that
no
i feel like we should because there was
a situation recently
maybe i'll talk about it later in which
i i saw a joke that was clearly
offensive like it targeted you know some
group that you shouldn't target
but on the other hand
the reason it was funny
was because everybody recognizes it as
wrong
that's different than just making a
racist joke where the where some people
laughing at it are laughing you know
because they're because they think it's
true or something
but if you're laughing at because it's
so wrong
i don't know i feel like that should be
okay
right i mean it's hard to distinguish
why somebody's laughing at a joke but if
you're laughing at it because you know
it's wrong and like it's the wrongness
then it's exactly what's making you
laugh
i feel like that's gonna that's gotta be
an exception
all right yeah but of course there's
gonna be you know some some point where
it's too much
i have a suggestion for the
uh spokesperson for the administration
karine jean pierre
whose name i'm starting to love
that's a really good name isn't it
karine karine jean so the first two
parts rhyme
karine jean pierre sort of a perfect
name it really is
but
i don't believe she's quite ready for
her job maybe she'll grow into it a
little bit but here is my
suggestion to her for her communications
skills
do not try to tell somebody something is
true
while your body is saying it's not
you need to get you need to get your
words
and your body
compatible
and what i mean is your words if you
believe that what you're saying is true
you should say it matter-of-factly
because true things can be said
matter-of-factly
but things that you know are a lie
don't act like you know it's a lie
you should at least pretend at least
pretend
that you don't know it's not true
but she actually acts like she knows
it's not true when she's saying it let
me give you
an impression
first i'll start with somebody saying
something that's true
and they know it
tomorrow morning the sun will come up at
uh
5 21 or whatever let's say that's true
tomorrow the sun will come up at 2 21
whatever is true never 221 let's say
five
right doesn't that sound like i believe
it's true
the sun will come up tomorrow
all right now let's uh
let's do karine gene pierre telling you
the sun will come up tomorrow like she
doesn't believe it
you ready
well the the sun the sun
you see the planet the planet is
rotating and uh
but but the sun the sun the sun sun will
come up
around
um but really but really it might look
like it might appear to you as if the
world you know the sun is going around
the world but really the world is
stationary well not really stationaries
is moving through space but let's not
talk about that but
why does she act like she knows she's
lying
am i wrong
now pundits make this mistake all the
time on tv
i call it the pleading begging
look to factual statements
if you have a factual statement that's
just a fact
say it that way
if you have a factual statement that
even you don't believe
say it in that pleading voice
well well you know the recession is not
so bad
it's not so bad
no
recession's not bad
that's the way you say if you believe it
if you believe it
say it that way
all right that's my advice
here is the best potential news
that probably isn't totally true
but i like telling you things that might
be true that are positive are you okay
with that
so where there's some positivity
involved i might go a little extra give
you a little extra positivity yeah just
because it feels good might not turn out
maybe it does maybe it doesn't
but you're going to feel good in the
meantime so that's worthwhile right
so i saw this tweet from ian martis
now keep in mind that he has he has some
background
and some expertise
that allows him to say the following
things
i have no expertise or ability to judge
it
so this is the part where well might be
true maybe it's true maybe it's not and
it's a hypothesis so ian puts it forth
as a maybe it's not it's not a statement
of fact it's a maybe
he says if you have if you have natural
immunity
but have not received a covet vaccine
then there is a good chance recovery
from a re-infection
could provide you with potent antibodies
that neutralizes sars1 and sars2 and all
variants
mirrors and maybe even common cold
coronaviruses
so in other words if you didn't get the
vaccine but you did get infected
you might have protection from all kinds
of things
but you know just sort of throw it in
there
now and the the argument is a technical
one that i can't i can't uh summarize
but the technical one is that the the
vaccines
the vaccines prevent infection in a in
say a
narrow way
whereas if you actually get infected
your infection is more of a broad
you know protection because everything
gets activated by that
that's sort of the general idio
explanation now i don't know if this is
true
i also don't know if there's any
difference between people who got the
original vaccine
people like me
versus people who got
omicron
vaccinations specifically
i would think
now this would be a question for ian
i would think
that if you got only the original
vaccination and the second one
and that wore off because they say it
wears off right if that completely wore
off and wasn't really applicable to
omicron anyway
wouldn't the omicron infection that i
did get
give me all this immunity that ian is
speculating might happen i don't know
maybe
so what would happen if the next several
years we see the the incidence of like
regular coals and all kinds of viruses
go way down
is it possible
that omicron
omicron acts like a vaccination
like a better vaccination than the
actual vaccinations it might now i don't
recommen recommend getting omicron it
kicked my ass for a month
i mean it really kicked my ass for a
month it was pretty rough
uh and the exhaustion part
but
maybe there's something good that comes
out of it
all right here's some more good news
maybe
or weird news
who actually runs the country
or the world i guess have you ever
figured out
you know
on paper it's joe biden and blah blah
blah the congress but when you actually
look at who actually matters
when it comes to legislation it's just
joe manchin right
am i wrong
i mean i said this i said this before
any of this became true
but early on i said there's only one
person running in the country it's the
smart one
joe manchin is the smart one
because by being
since things are so close
simply being willing to go either way
gives you all the power
all the people who are not willing to
even consider
being flexible they gave away all their
power they don't have any
so mansion just said wait a minute
are you telling me all i have to do is
act reasonable in public and i can have
all the power in the country
yup
yup
you just have to be a reasonable person
who is willing to negotiate
and willing to give you the other side a
little bit if you get a little bit just
that
just a normal normal person
and you can run the whole country
just be normal
because nobody else was trying
nobody else was trying to be normal
in every other context in life people
negotiate
yeah they're flexible they have to be
it's only congress that people are not
flexible so the one guy who said hey
suppose i get flexible now he runs the
country
who was in charge of
let's say climate policy for
way too long it was greta wasn't it
greta tunberg because her personality
was so big that
she made it hard to you know go against
her
so the people were really running the
world were
uh dr burks
am i right because you know
the leaders take their
take their instructions on the pandemic
from the experts
so as fouchy and berks
greta tunberg
joe manchin maybe kristen cinema a
little bit but mostly joe manchin
and then
people like me
people who just say stuff in public and
some of his sticks
that's it
the the people running the country have
are absolutely not the ones you think
are running the country
yeah elon musk etc you know elon musk
will have more to do with
america's space program
than the government will
am i wrong
elon musk is basically in charge of
the american space policy in effect i
mean he didn't ask didn't sign up for it
but it worked out that way what about
health care
probably jeff bezos
probably jeff bezos is in charge of it
right i'm being prompted on the locals
platform there yeah so it turns out that
america is this weird place where any
one person can be in charge of an entire
topic or multiple topics you just have
to be smart enough to put yourself in
that position
and some of these people did
it's a it's a weird world where you can
run the world or run one topic just as
an individual
you just have to see the opening and
walk into it
so what is this uh
big
big ish legislation that joe manchin
finally got behind and caused happen
he did some good stuff
and i have to i think i have to call
that out
uh and it's you know it's not all good
there's stuff you're not gonna like
there's stuff other people aren't gonna
like but that was the point right
the fact that you don't like part of it
is what makes it work that's why joe
manchin was valuable he got he got
something that not everybody loved but
worked maybe
and i think it's getting reasonably good
reviews
is it not
you know the
the uh and it's not passed yet this
happens to us yes
anyway but here's what it does it
slashes the renewable energy tax credit
by 80
so renewables will be
relatively de-emphasized from where they
were they'll still be emphasized but
not as much
and it extends
those tax credits to existing nuclear
plants
and it prohibits wind and solar
development on federal land or in
federal waters unless
oil and gas leases have also been issued
so in other words what manchin said
was let's make it an all-energy program
not a some energy we love and some
energy we don't
now how smart is that
very right
in fact
isn't that actually the
that used to be the republican
point of view right do all the energy as
much as you can because the problem is
running out
the big problem is running out
the big problem is not the climate
that's the second problem
so do the first one problem but do a
smart and make sure that nuclear becomes
a bigger part of the pie
which is what manchin is trying to make
happen
every part of this
seems directionally correct you could
argue about the specifics but
directionally this looks right right
do i see any disagreement moving money
from green
well not green but let's let's call it
wind and solar
to make sure that nuclear is equally
supported
that just makes sense
so good on mansion for that
um they call it leveling the playing
field for the energy choices uh that's
good enough he also got something in
that the bill
that would
quote encourage reassuring of solar
panel manufacturing
so getting the the manufacturing maybe
for windmills too i'm not sure but
getting some of the manufacturing for
this green technology back from china
and into the united states
how good an idea is that
really good
really good yeah cylindrica okay
you can do it wrong
right there's a way to do anything wrong
but we can't let china control our
manufacturing
we know we can't do that
so i'm in favor of this you know there
might be some bumps in the road with
this but
um so that's good
and
but in terms of fighting against
inflation which is the name of the bill
apparently the experts are saying yeah
it might help a little
a little bit
but it's not that big a deal for the
economy it's actually not a big bill
apparently
in the grand scheme of things it isn't
even that big but
maybe something good will come out of it
so i'm going to say i feel a little bit
optimistic
about that
do you
no it's still not passed anything could
happen
but do you feel optimistic about the
fact that this got negotiated
a little bit
those of you saying no
why is it too expensive
because the experts say it might
actually bring down the deficit because
there's a tax increase part of it i
guess
so it actually is supposed to reduce
reduce inflation a little bit
because we need to stop spending money i
think that's a perfectly good point of
view but i would remind you that nobody
knows how much debt we can handle
i don't know why
it feels like something we should be
able to figure out but nobody seems to
know
so
i share your concern that too much debt
is dangerous
i just don't know what is too much
and this seems to be
part of reducing that debt so i know
nobody likes raising taxes but on the
other hand it did work
didn't it work for clinton
remind me during the clinton
administration bill clinton
did he not raise taxes and the economy
did well
can somebody give me a give me a history
lesson on that that's true right
he raised taxes and still the economy
did well
that was because of the dot com era more
than because of what he did right
anyway so we're not good at predicting
the future about
about economics
well the matt gates effect
continues to spread and i call that the
the be offended
be
offended
so hashtag be offended is trending on
twitter
still
so the background is that matt gates
said some things about the protesters
who were
liberals and he said basically that they
were overweight and ugly
and when challenged with that he said
yeah be offended
anyway
a twitter user named cornpop gives me
this context cornpop says
they call us i guess he means
republicans they call us nazis
homophobic islamophobic xenophobic bible
thumpers murderers misogynist genocidal
racists who aren't equal blah blah and
then he goes on he says however
when we say they're fat it's the end of
the world
now
now to me that's funny
but also offensive
would you agree
now i i'm opposed
i'm opposed to fat shaming
right
so we don't do that here
um
i don't do fat shaming and the reason is
i don't i don't believe in free will
i don't believe that there are people
saying i think i'd like to be 400 pounds
i know i think everybody wants to look
beautiful and sexy it's just not the
same challenge for everybody
so i i'm a little bit more forgiving
than you are about that i do think that
people should be encouraged to be
healthy
you know but there's some line that you
don't want to cross
however
uh this is another example where i think
it's just funny
that if if you're being called a nazi
homophobic genocidal racist and your
only response is calling the other side
fat
i think that's okay
yeah in context
if somebody's calling you names that's
okay
did any of you see my little dust up on
twitter this morning with a username
kyle
kyle decided to tweet at me and mention
me in a tweet
in a rather insulting way
rather aggressively
insulting kyle was surprised that i
would read it and respond aggressively
kyle did not like to be insulted
and he called me out for insultium
to which i said kyle
you ignorant piece of
what did you think would happen when you
insulted me first
did you think i would just
mute you or block you sometimes i do
that
but
you're a free punch buddy
you're a free punch
if you insult me in public i'm going to
come at you as hard as i want to just
for fun
just for fun you know people watching
say oh scott's mad sometimes
not today today was just for fun you
insult me first you're my
entertainment for the rest of the day
those are the rules you insult me first
in public you're my for
the rest of the day
for free free entertainment and
everybody else gets to watch
so
i don't make the rules
i don't make the rules
all right and i i generally don't
i generally well do i
maybe maybe i insult people first
it's twitter after all i'm sure i've
done that
he has no free will kyle well neither do
i i can't help going after
well the
the race for congress is tightening up
you know that big lead that a generic
republican had over a generic democrat
starting to close according to rasmussen
polling
so it's getting down to a five point
difference so i think it had been up to
a nine point difference people
preferring a generic republican in the
midterms
but
a little history lesson it's not unusual
for those gaps
to completely close by election day
so no matter how big that gap is now
nine or five points
by election day it could be zero
it could be zero so don't get too cocky
about your big republican lead if you
think that's a good thing
probably it's just going to go away
toward the end now it doesn't mean the
republicans won't sweep
but it'll probably be a lot closer than
you think
right so we'll see what happens
and it is a lot of different polling
organizations so i wouldn't worry i
wouldn't worry that the pollsters are
all in on some kind of a plot or
anything like that there are enough
pollsters to
guarantee that doesn't happen well were
you waiting for the funniest story of
the day
i know you are nbc news reports
that the biden administration has
authorized completion of the
trump-funded u.s mexico border wall
in an open area of southern arizona near
yuma
where four wide gap gaps make it among
the busiest corridors for illegal
crossings
okay
now uh was there anybody you know who
predicted that biden would have to
adopt trump's policies that were working
this guy
this guy yeah from the very beginning i
said you know he's gonna have to just do
what trump did he's just gonna be forced
into it in the end so here's more in
that direction
but given that the
democrats do not like to
use the same names for things that other
people do
we can't really call it trump's wall can
we if biden is building it the democrats
are not going to they're not going to
want to say
we decided to keep building trump's wall
so he's going to need some kind of name
for it like so i was thinking what could
you call the wall
besides trump's wall
and i
luckily there are a whole bunch of words
that don't have any meaning
that can be repurposed
so find a word that used to mean
something but no longer has any meaning
whatsoever and then you maybe repurpose
that for trump's wall for example
recession
you say that biden is building a
recession on the southern border
because recession used to mean something
but now it doesn't mean anything how
about woman
we'll call it a woman
again doesn't have any specific
definitions so it's available
it's available
well to make things funnier mayor bowser
in washington dc
seems to be concerned that uh
her idea of becoming a sanctuary city
became was taken a little bit too
seriously
it turns out that when she
said d.c would be a sanctuary city and
immigrants would be welcome there with
open arms
she was not counting on the texas
governor busting her as many immigrants
as she wanted
which is one of the funniest political
plays of all time
that is funny
now when it first happened it just felt
like like a political grandstanding kind
of thing
but i didn't realize you would actually
do it
did you
did you think that texas would actually
just say all right i don't care how many
buses it takes that you're all going to
washington d.c
it's brilliant
it's brilliant
the the other border states you know
maybe arizona should do it so you should
start shipping all the extra immigrants
to washington d.c and give them a phone
like give them some incentive to go to
washington dc
because i think it's greg guffield who
says this the most
i don't remember seeing anybody else say
it as clearly
nobody's going to change anything until
it comes to their doorstep
when it comes to their doorstep well
they'll get serious
so texas said well they're on our
doorstep let's see how you feel we'll
put them on your doorstep and then they
actually did it so they've only got four
thousand but bowser is already calling
up the national guard
to help out now she's not saying she's
not crying uncle
and she's not saying oh we're not a
sanctuary city anymore she's gotta kind
of go with that but she's gonna have to
eat it i mean she's got to eat every
every challenge that comes with us
because she signed up for it so there
you go
all right i have a question for you
um
if you're a public figure and you talk
about politics so people like me are in
that category
what should you do if you suspect uh
a foreign intelligence agency is
trying to connect with you
should i do anything about that
because every now and then i'll get a
contact from somebody who's obviously
not an american citizen
and is trying a little too hard to be my
friend
you know what i
mean yeah and
uh i'm not it's nothing you've heard of
right
but
am i supposed to do something with that
no i'm not talking about you know on
twitter on twitter everything's public
well everything everything on that
category is public
so
but just generally speaking should i
but should you contact the fbi just
because you have a vague suspicion
if somebody says is she hot
that makes a difference
no
and by the way if you're thinking to
yourself
if you're thinking to yourself watching
this
that you might be the one i'm talking
about it's not you
if you've contacted me recently on
social media don't worry i'm not talking
about you i don't think you're a foreign
agent it's just something happened you
know not too long ago that i looked at
and i said you know
this doesn't smell right
now if you're a man
can the men confirm this do you get a
lot of social media
traffic there's obviously somebody
pretending to be a woman and it's going
to be some scam you get a lot of those
right
but they have a they have a specific
look to them
you can identify those immediately
but sometimes you get one that's going a
little extra
like throwing in some politics and stuff
i got i got questions i don't know
fang fang is a baldy chaser
maybe
but that's a serious question
at what point should i actually get
somebody else involved
now i don't think there's any risk
because i'm not you know there's nobody
contacting me that would influence me in
any way
i don't think
can you screenshot and post on locals no
because no i can't do that because it
might be just somebody who's being nice
right
that's the problem it could be a
completely
friendly person who's being nice or has
some other ulterior motive but it's not
so i'm not going to end with somebody
just for that
but it's definitely a suspicious contact
from
from russia
i'll give you a name is a russian
a russian person who clearly looks like
i don't know that you would be
contacting me the way you're contacting
me
without that
and
but let me ask you more generally
if you were russia
would you not be trying to influence
american influencers
you would when you
wouldn't that be the most basic thing
you would do
is try to influence the influencers
because they're they're not that many of
them there might be uh
well give me a number how many
public influencers are there
that matter to russia
like
the top you know the ones that make a
difference it's sort of a 20 80 80 20
rule here it can't it's not everybody
who talks about it makes a difference
they're only a small percentage of the
people who talk about politics who can
move the needle
and i'm one of them
right
the fbi is not your friend that's a good
point
yeah because i was thinking you know
should i contact the fbi or something if
i think i've been contacted by a foreign
agent
and
somebody said the fbi is not your friend
you're actually you're absolutely right
you're absolutely right and so that's
the answer to my question
yeah unfortunately that's the answer to
my question i would not contact the fbi
because i don't trust them
think about that
how up is that
like that's an actual decision i just
made a decision
that even if i suspected i wouldn't
contact the fbi because i don't trust
him
with anything
i don't trust him with anything i don't
trust him to have my name
i don't trust him to be looking into
something on my behalf nothing i don't
trust him with anything
but i will say that the contact was a
very casual one and i'm not going to
follow up on it so so there's nothing to
worry about if you're the fbi
it was a casual contact and i'm not
going to be i won't be following up on
it
all right
i saw a
study that says republicans are more
likely to be married than democrats
by a fairly large percentage
fairly large percentage
that makes sense doesn't it
now
but i wondered if this is really telling
me what i think it is
because it's suggesting there's
something about being married
that's correlated with being republican
which is probably true
but
does anybody i haven't looked at
republicans are older right
am i right
yeah every between you know seems like
between 18 and 25
is probably at least 60 percent
democrat
yeah
so
i don't know if that's telling me
something but
i don't think we could ignore the fact
that the single versus married and
younger versus older
are pretty important elements
more important the democrat versus
republican probably
somehow we lose sight of that stuff
um
so
how many of you know what what
schrodinger's cat is
i have an unusual audience which is true
by the way this is probably the most
educated audience
maybe anywhere you know
it's possible
um so most of you know what it is but
for this
is there anybody who doesn't know what
it is you're all saying yes
do you know in the in the general public
doesn't know what schrodinger's cat is
you know that right
my god how do you all know about it
i i i'm just saying a few no's and all
the rest of yes you are a really
educated group
this is i'm blown away i'm blown away
yeah if you use that as a marker for how
well informed somebody is
that that's like a really good one for
finding out if somebody's
you know
wrestled with some of the more
interesting
questions in science for example
so schrodinger's cat is based on the
you know quantum physics theories
that something doesn't exist until it's
observed or measured
and schrodinger said that couldn't
possibly be true i think i'm
mischaracterizing schrodinger but this
is the basic idea
that can't be true if those equations
are true
it would mean the following and the
following can't be true
and the following was that you could
take a cat a living cat put it in a box
seal the box so that nobody can hear it
or see it and nobody knows what's
happening with the cat
put in the box is some kind of
radioactive decaying thing that is
unpredictable
totally random
and then that thing under some
conditions would trigger a poison that
kills the cat and under other conditions
would not but if you're outside the box
you can never predict and never know
what's happening inside the box
and schroedinger says the equations tell
us
that under those conditions the cat is
both
alive and dead
at the same time
and so he said the equations must be
wrong
because that's not possible
was it einstein who said it yeah so i
got uh
let me let me confess i got everything
about that story wrong
can you confirm that
confirm in the comments i got i got most
of that story wrong
but it's close it's like in the ballpark
right maybe einstein said it i think
there's also some dispute
about what schrodinger really believed
and what he meant by the
by the experiment
so there's a popular interpretation of
what he meant but i think the actual
interpretation is more subtle
however
that doesn't matter to my point
what matters to my point is that
schrodinger was proven correct
simulation theory
allows that cat to be both alive and
dead at the same time
so we actually do now have a theory
that is the theory of everything
you know how einstein and the most
important scientists have been looking
forever for a theory that would tie
together all the forces and it would
explain why everything is everything and
how it all fits together
that's done
it's done
it's called the simulation theory
here are some of the
the things that quantum physics couldn't
figure out and was trying to reconcile
how could it be that the cat could be
both alive and dead at the same time in
the box
simulation theory
if we're software that's easy
the software doesn't create your history
until you need it
so in simulation theory you don't need a
history of what the cat had done until
somebody looks at it or measures it
and then at that point you consolidate
it into reality or the perceived reality
and then it can build a history
but in simulation theory
what you do today
creates the past
so the past doesn't always exist except
the past that was observed and measured
that past does exist
but anything that wasn't already
observed and measured
what happens in the present creates that
past
so not only does the past create the
future
that's confirmed
but in simulation theory the the
the present can also create the past
now
give me a little fact check on this
because science isn't my strongest
category
is it not true that the formulas about
time and the arrow of time work in both
directions
and that science is a little puzzled by
that
how can the error the the equations for
time i guess space-time
they seem to work in both directions
now now there's an argument that that's
not true that the arrow of time works in
one direction but i'm pretty sure that
the equations have been said
to work in both directions but that in a
practical in a practical sense that
didn't matter
that time only goes forward
but simulation theory allows you to
actually have it both ways
simulation theory would say yeah it
makes total sense
that the present can create the past and
that the and that the past can create
the future both of them would be true
so
how about the uh
the speed of light doesn't make any
sense does it
how does it make sense there's a maximum
speed
how does that make sense
well for software it makes sense
because you have to put limits on you
know what the artificial world can do so
you just put that limit on a speed of
light
how does something have a beginning
that doesn't make any sense
like everything is explained
everything by the simulation so
everybody who's looking for the grand
you know
formula that ties everything together
stop looking
it's just software
the reason you can't find it is that it
exists in a different domain
is this in the domain of software it can
make anything look possible
here's another one
bell's theorem
so give me a fact check on this too
bell's theorem given i don't have the
exact language for this so so fix my
language as i go in in the comments
uh you take a is it a particle with a
certain spin and you break it in half
and
separate the two particles by any amount
of uh
distance
uh no it's if you haven't measured the
spin
of a
if you haven't measured the spin and
then you separate them
measuring one of them
makes you know what the other one is no
matter where it is so in other words
quantum integral yeah so a spooky action
that is at a distance
so within
within science
we know that nothing can move faster
than the speed of light
except that the spooky action at a
distance does
so you have two things that can't both
be true
you can't have something affecting
something across great distances
instantly because that means the signal
from one to the other would travel
faster than the speed of light
but you can't
so physics can't explain that
you know a cat
simulation theory
because in simulation theory there's no
distance it's just software so anything
can happen at the same time but you
might also have some rules to keep
people in your universe and maybe you
add the speed of light as a distance so
any kind of conflict
that physics can't figure out like how
could this be true all the time where
the opposite is true also all the time
software
software can make opposites work it can
do anything
so all those little
little uh
imperfections that we haven't figured
out in
science
probably just because we're a simulation
all right
bell's experiment proved einstein right
about non-locality right
so
in my view
every every mystery in science is solved
by the simulation and perfectly solved
it doesn't leave anything left there's
nothing left to explain it's all done
so that doesn't mean simulation theory
is true
you're conflating software with theory
now i'm using software more as an
analogy
so when i say software and that we're a
simulation it doesn't mean we're
necessarily bits because we don't know
what some advanced civilization
would use to program something
but sort of
conceptually we're software not maybe
maybe not literally
um
it's all solved by
god somebody says
language easily generates paradoxes you
are correct
a lot of things that look like paradoxes
are probably the limitations of language
that's exactly correct
physics can't be explained to people
because when physicists try to explain
their formulas
they try to turn it into words
because that's what people understand
but once you change the math into words
it actually becomes nonsense
bell's theorem it's just nonsense in
words
all right
um
software runs on hardware well in our in
our universe it does
i don't know what hardware means in some
other reality
but anyway that was all a long long way
to get to this joke how do we end up
with schrodinger's president
simultaneously alive and dead at the
same time you know what i mean
you know what i mean
biden is technically alive
we'd all agree on that
but have you ever seen any human being
who who seemed more technically dead and
alive at the same time
at the same time
you have not
no
no nobody's ever been as dead and alive
at the same time
and that ladies and gentlemen
concludes
some of the best live streaming you've
ever seen in your young life
and may i mention
how good you look today
have you been exercising
i think you have
here's a question for you
what happens when
i've assembled the smartest audience in
politics
could get interesting
and we might already be there
name an audience that's smarter than
this one
i think lex friedman gets pretty smart
people tim ferriss gets pretty smart
people
but i feel like this is among the
smartest and the the other things that
you don't get on other content
is that we collectively work on our
thinking and knowledge as we go
you see that right you feel it
don't you feel like we're sort of
working through things together you see
me change my opinions based on your
feedback etc
yeah so i feel like we're
like a almost a collective mind that's
involved in some kind of intentional
self-improvement
that's a good way to put it
we are like a meta mind you know the the
some of us collectively working together
like a mind and we do seem to be
intentionally and that's an important
word here
intentionally involved in
self-improvement
you know if you look at the people on
the locals platform they've got over 200
micro lessons they put their two-minute
lessons to give you like a permanent
life skill
there are people on youtube and the
locals
who have consumed
over 200 lessons each one individually
could change your life
i got a feeling that people are starting
to develop superpowers over there
for the benefit of the youtube viewers
i'm gonna i'll read off some comments
but on the locals platform
how many of you have gotten a raise a
promotion
found love
got healthier
because of following this content
right if you watch the if you can see
the comments it's it's just like a
complete string
of people oh lacey
you guys talk among yourselves
but look at the comments
i don't know if you can see them
maybe they're backwards or something on
your screen they're backwards than mine
i think the screen reverses them on
yours
but look at all the people who
uh their lives were substantially
changed
without too much
effort i mean not too much effort to
learn how to do it
and in many cases it doesn't take much
effort to do it so i'm working on a book
on reframing i'm going to be
off-site for a few days i'm doing some
serious writing and the reframing book
i think will
here's how i'm thinking of it
i'm thinking of my next book
to be almost like harry potter spells
actually simple sentences that that are
so powerful
that they reprogram your mind
and i'll give you my my one example of a
reframe and see if see if this works for
you
the thing about a reframe is it doesn't
need to be true
and once you accept that important part
then you can use them all
if you think the reframe has to be true
you'll be limited
a reframe is just a way to reprogram
your brain to work better it doesn't
have to be true
and you could even know it's not true
when you use it let me give you an
example
have you ever heard
the customer is always right
that's a reframe
the reframe is from well let's figure
out who's right are you right or am i
right normally
the reframe is the customer is always
right now here's the question
is that true no
it's not even close to true
it's a million miles from being true
is it useful
oh yeah
it's super useful
super useful
because that that one sentence almost
changed
i don't know
the the way business is done
i mean i think that one sentence changed
business
forever the whole world because if you
act as though the customer is always
right you just get a better outcome
right that's that's pretty well
demonstrated if you argue with a
customer or you're going to get an angry
customer if you just treat them like
they're right
you get a better outcome and you'll get
repeat business and everything else
so
imagine if you had more of those
more of those very simple statements
like the customer is always right that
you simultaneously know is wrong
but it gives you like a little guideline
of how to act
that really works
how would you like to have 100 of those
right you're not in sales so that one
doesn't matter to you but suppose they
were about your health
suppose here's another one
alcohol is poison
now when you first hear it you say well
that's sort of facile and you know
you're not really saying anything
blah blah but i can tell you from
experience
i don't know how many people have quit
alcohol because of that sentence the
people on the locals platform tell me
all the time that that one sentence
alcohol is poison
because we think of it as entertainment
right you think of alcohol as a beverage
and you think of it as
and it is
it's also a beverage it's also
entertainment
but
is it true that alcohol is poisoned well
not technically right but it doesn't
matter
it doesn't matter if it's true
you just run that little loop in your
head and it's easier to avoid it that's
it
just run the loop
true or not and it's easier to avoid it
because avoiding poison is easy
so you just all you're doing is
connecting
to concepts in a useful way oh poison
and alcohol oh that would be useful to
connect though so i don't i don't get
tempted by alcohol that's all it is
now again
so there's one that you know
customer is always right completely
changes the your
your odds of success in business
right most of you would agree with that
statement completely changes your odds
of success
alcohol is poison
completely changes your odds of reducing
your drinking
it doesn't help for an alcoholic by the
way
if you're an alcoholic you already know
it's poisonous
there's nothing you can do about that in
terms of reframes
there might be there might be a reframe
that does help you with alcoholism but
it's not that one right that's not the
one
somebody said it is helpful right
you know there's a lot of individual
difference but i wouldn't let me put it
this way i wouldn't sell that reframe to
you as helping with alcoholism because i
think that's an oversell
i feel that would reduce my credibility
if i made that claim
i'm just going to say that people who
like to have too many drinks on the
weekend because it's fun
it really does help them cut back
that's what they tell me
now again imagine having a hundred of
those
right
a hundred reframes that aren't true
exactly but they completely change how
effective you are so that's what the
book will be
i'll have as many of those as i can
all right
light does not have a speed is a
perturbation of the ether
all right
well if you'd like to go back to
perturbating your ether
this would be the time to do it i've got
some things to do today
and
the best reframe is don't be yourself
that is a good one all right and uh
that's all for today
uh read mind shift by barbara oakley
okay
um
and that's all for today i'll talk to
you tomorrow youtube and spotify
