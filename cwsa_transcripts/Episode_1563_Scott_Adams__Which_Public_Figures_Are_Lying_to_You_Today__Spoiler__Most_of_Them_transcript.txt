good morning everybody
by the way do you know why i always open
a drawer and take out my my notes before
i do this simultaneously it's not
because
just because i don't remember it
that's part of it
but it's also
i'm seeing funny memes go by on the
locals platform
uh by the way locals has in their
comments you can embed uh memes and
pictures
so the the locals uh
comment stream is freaking hilarious
compared to the
the youtube stream which is just text
but when you look at the the locals the
locals feed it's hard not to laugh
all right
so the reason the reason that i always
do this
sometimes youtube click clips off this
part
but let me tell you why i do it
so listen to it again see if you can
hear it
it's basically an introduction
so it's a it's also a trigger
or a key as we say in hypnosis if you
hear it every time
you should
if you like the content from prior shows
it should put you immediately in the
headspace
so it's sort of a trick
to put you in the right frame of mind by
repetition
same as really any any theme music for
any show it's the same idea
so all kinds of stuff going on today
uh i'm going to be cursing a little bit
there will be some cursing coming up so
this would not be the one that you want
to share with your
with your uh
sensitive friends and to our children
okay
well let's say children who are not
familiar with
swear words
i'm pretty sure any kid under you know
14 or older is going to be fine
and you probably shouldn't show this to
anybody who's under 14.
but anybody over 14 has heard all the
words right by the way have you ever
heard 14 year olds talk to each other
it's a lot worse than what i say
so they're not going to be damaged by it
but anyway that's just your warning but
uh first topic is uh i'll be swearing on
the very next topic in case in case
you're wondering
the very next topic will have some anger
and cursing
and then we'll get back into the fun
stuff
but first
there might be an alzheimer vaccination
according to the telegraph
there's a vaccine against alzheimer's
disease it could be on the horizon
because it's worked in mice they
actually
um
yeah i see your comment carpe i'll get
back to that
and it actually reversed memory loss in
mice
what
how do you reverse memory loss
how do you even do that
apparently that's the thing
oh oh there's something wrong i have
done something very bad
you know what it is right
yes you do
let's fix this all you need is a cup or
a mug or a glass of tanker gel system a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except your memory apparently
it's called the simultaneous sip but it
happens now go
i don't know how i went so long without
that
but now all systems are operating 100
100
so yes there's this vaccination
allegedly that works on animals that
gives them their memory their memory
back
now and
the story goes on to describe exactly
how they do it and it actually sounds
like something that works
they found the exact problem with the
memory and they reproduced a
well they created a vaccine that
operates directly against that memory
loss
element
well here are a few thoughts on this
number one
why are we calling this a vaccination
anybody
did you notice i slipped that in
did you uncritically accept
that this was a
vaccination
did any of you say vaccination
that doesn't sound like a vaccination
does it
right well i guess it could be used as a
preventive so it could be a prophylactic
if you get the shot they're thinking
that maybe
it might actually be a vaccination
might actually be an actual vaccination
that prevents you from getting
alzheimer's but i don't think so
i think what they're looking at is
something that makes it a lot better
right
because i i don't think they're saying
that we think if you take this
vaccination you'll never get alzheimer's
i think they're saying if you get the
vaccination it might not affect you as
much
so you've noticed that the definition of
a vaccination has just completely
changed
now vaccination and therapeutic are
basically the same thing
at this point what makes it a
vaccination is that they give it to you
in a in a shot am i wrong
i think at this point we're going to
call anything in a shot
of vaccination
if it helps at all
so i don't know if that's
meaningful or not but words words have
just started to drift in meaning
maybe more than usual
uh here's the funniest comment on this
alzheimer vaccination article from james
feffery
on uh or puffery i don't know how to
his last name starts with pf
which one is silent the f for the p
p f e f f e r l e
fefferly
preferably well anyway james
preferably
uh says that uh about the alzheimer's
vaccination biden gets his mind back
hilarity soon follows
i did what
this is a pretty funny comment you can
imagine you can imagine biden getting
the shot
you know two years from now or something
he gets the shot and you see biden
sitting there he gets the shot he goes
wait
i did what
now
if i've if i've taught you
and i think i've taught many of you how
to write jokes right how many of you
have seen any of my tutorials about
writing humor
i guess most of them have been on the
locals platform so i don't think the
youtubers have seen them but one of the
tricks of writing humor
is that you create a situation where
people can
fill out the punch line in their mind
so you give them the boost you know the
little
you know the imagining biden saying
quote i did what
but the beauty of that punch line
is that it makes you imagine the full
scene
right so the scene that you put in there
is in your own mind it's not in the joke
the joke is just as one line i did what
and then you just imagine the fullness
of the scene that
is a good joke
all right that you can't beat that form
of humor where somebody has to recreate
the details in their head from your
punchline
so there's your humor humor writing
trick for the day
um i'd like to get into a little bit of
swearing
next um have you heard of a book
called white fragility
white fragility and you've heard the
term right white fragility i think it
has to do with you know white people
feeling bad if anybody else gets some
good stuff something like that
um
you know that's racist right
white fragility you couldn't say that
about anybody else
that's purely racist
it's not even a little bit racist
this is like the old school you know no
systemic anything here
direct
racism
well apparently uh since we haven't we
meeting
anybody who doesn't like that has not
pushed back on that
um i got a comment today on uh twitter
from uh it doesn't even matter what the
topic was but the comment to me was that
uh
white eggs have the softest shells
it was a comment about my
ethnicity
and a suggestion that i'm
extra sensitive because i'm white
so i responded back
you racist piece of
you know
i don't know what too far looks like
right you know that i identify as black
because i've been discriminated against
so severely in my life that's not a joke
if anybody if anybody's new to me
none of that's a joke
i literally identify as black because i
can those are the rules
the rules are i can identify any what i
want and that's who i identify with the
most and also i like to be in the
winning team
if i have a choice
of being on the winning team or the
losing team why would you why would you
pick the losing team so i picked the
winning team
i think black americans are ascending
white americans are descending and i'd
like to get some of those benefits
i'm allowed
the the rules allow me to do that so i'd
like to get some of those benefits
and you should too because it's
available to everybody and nobody is
excluded from defining their own their
own
situation
but
i would like to say this to all the
people who would like to get away with
calling white people who i don't
identify with but i still support there
i still support their struggle
um
when you say white eggs are the softest
shells you you
 your family
 you
every article every particle in your
 racist piece of body
 you completely
drop dead right
if you can go in public
and say racist directly not
even hinting at it
 you
if you want to see how
fragile
my shell is
don't push me
because you're gonna find out
so
anytime you see this you know the white
fragility and
you know white people are sensitive and
even the karen stuff
by the way i think white people should
be able to call
white women karen's
nobody else
nobody else
who's with me
and again i'm not i don't identify as a
white person so i'm just supporting the
struggle of the people who are
um i'm going to start using the n-word
i'm going to start using the n-word
because first of all i identify as black
but secondly if
if white women can be called karen's
and that's okay with everybody
everybody's okay with that
don't push it
now i've been very much in favor of the
n-word being excluded from
civilized society
it's a horrible word
it should be banned forever
now of course you know free speech of
course can't ban it
but in terms of what feels right as you
know a human being like i don't ever
want to hear that word
um
so i'm okay with that as an exception
right it's like a minor exception
but
i feel like
there's a little bit of taking advantage
going on here don't you think
so
for those of you who like to call uh
white people karen's and fragile
you you pieces of racist
moving on
um biden's slogan build back better
um
there was an observation by spike cohen
on
twitter
who makes this observation so build back
better
build what would be another word for
build
to build something
make right you make something or you
build it
kind of similar
what would be another another word for
back as it's used in this not we're not
talking about the back on your body
but back in this context means
historically
back
you know to take us back to something
sort of like again
yeah it's sort of like again
we'll do back it's like again
and then better
what would be another word for better
so it's sort of a synonym for better oh
great if he did something better than it
was it's probably great
so literally build back better is just
make
america great again
i mean it leaves out the america part
because the dems don't like america as
much
but
all it is is just a copy of
it's literally just a copy of
make america great again they just
changed the words
and somehow i didn't notice
how did i go this long without noticing
that it's just it's just mega
how did we do that did any of you notice
before this
how in the world did we not notice this
isn't that freaky
it's freaky like it's my job to notice
this stuff right because i'm a word guy
it's literally my job to notice i didn't
see it
so good good observation spike cohen
all right because i'm fair and balanced
i will tell you the fake news on cnn
but i will also tell you the fake news
on fox news
do you think that fox news ever has any
fake news
well you be the judge uh so here's a fox
news headline
uh so first of all some background so
kamal harris uh appeared in an event
with biden and um
some other person was introduced
as kamala harris goes to the uh lecter
so kamala kamala walks up to the lectern
and then the voice of god you know the
the announcer says
uh introducing and then it was just some
other person
that they were going to introduce after
her
now
uh come on i saw kamilaris getting
mocked by the conservatives for you know
being dissed and being
you know in this awkward situation
but i had a completely different take on
it and i'm not sure why i mean it's
obviously subjective but my take on it
is that she handled it perfectly
actually one of the best things i've
seen her do in public
do you disagree
here's what i saw and so so she didn't
create the situation right she was cast
into the situation she gets up there
she's ready to talk and then the voice
introduces a different person
instead of looking shook up
she smiled and here's here's a little
public speaking tip for you
the pause
the pause
there is nothing harder
than pausing for two seconds
when something like that happens
because the pause gives you time to
think
but you don't you don't give yourself
that pause when you're in front of a
crowd usually you just start talking and
something silly comes out
but she paused
now that's the first time
i've seen
poise
of of the professional kind that you'd
expect from a top level politician
she paused
and then
what was her then her quote was she goes
she smiles and she goes in a moment
and then she goes on with the thing
it was kind of perfect
kind of perfect
right now now if you if you're not
familiar with my
commentary
i i've been uh just brutal
about kamala harris's public uh persona
it's just so cringy just horrible most
of the time worst i've ever seen
honestly it's honestly the worst i've
ever seen but in this moment
i thought she handled it
as well as that could be handled i don't
think that could have been better
anyway here's how fox news
uh
writes about it now you should also know
that cnn had a a really critical report
of kamala harris yesterday all right so
that's your background here's fox news
headline white house announcer appears
to skip kamala harris at infrastructure
bill signing after disastrous cnn report
so the white house announcer appears to
skipper
after the disastrous cnn report
do you think that these things are
connected
do you think there's a connection
between the cnn report
and the white house announcers skipping
her
no
no
there's no connection
and then and then you get to the bottom
of the article and it even says well
there's probably no connection
it's probably just a mistake in you know
the announcer and there's nothing else
there
so they write this whole fake news
headline to make you think that maybe
the white house has turned against
kamala harris
so much that they're not even going to
introduce it right
that didn't happen
nothing like that happened
the headline is pure fake news
and if they covered this
accurately they'd say the announcer made
a mistake
and harris uh adeptly handled it
that should have been the news
the news should have been the announcer
made a stake mistake
and the vice president adeptly
adeptly handled it
now
i saw a tweet from
ed latimer the other day
about steel man arguments
and a steel man argument is when you
argue the other side
as convincingly as possible before you
give your counterpoint
so if you can't describe the other
side's argument perfectly
your your debate against it really is
weak because you're not even debating
the right thing you're debating a straw
man
so if you can't if you can't say
something good
legitimately
about the other team
nobody should take you seriously
i won't
if i see you say nothing good about the
other side ever i don't take you
seriously
just know that
just know that i will never take you
seriously if you can't say something
good about the other side
something because there's always
something right
if you can't say anything good
you're probably an npc
all right
so um that was my saying something good
about harris so the next time i
criticize her you should put that in
context
and i will
here's a question for you nama biden's
success and you know success is
subjective right but name a biden's
success is president
that wouldn't have happened anyway just
on its own no matter who was president
name something he did that wouldn't have
happened just anyway
would the stock market have gone up
probably
probably
now i gave uh i gave trump
credit for the stock market because he
cut taxes or was planning to cut taxes
and then did
and he also directly talked it up
which is actually good technique because
stock markets and the economy itself
work on
persuasion and you know psychology
so there was a there was a reason that
you could quite see you could see the
connection
trump did x the stock market you know
responded
so in that case i think you could say
trump gets some of the credit but maybe
not all of it right because the the
economy tends to go up over time
but i don't see anything that biden did
that would be good for the stock market
didn't you
what would be the argument that biden
did something to help the stock market
anything the infrastructure bill does
that help the stock market
i don't know does it
you're saying infrastructure but isn't
there just as much argument that it
hurts the economy because of the
spending
i know and that you're spending on the
wrong things in some cases
so okay i'll give you that
i'll give you infrastructure but here's
the second point
don't you think the infrastructure deal
would have happened anyway
i do
see i think congress kicked that can
down the road as long as they could kick
it and then something was going to
happen
now of course they needed they needed
the you know democratic
majority but they also needed some
republicans to to cross the line i feel
like that would just would have happened
anyway because you can't you can't go
forever without doing a bill
on the most important things in the
country right congress just can't go
forever
they got to do it someday
so it just happened now
how about the employment numbers um i
don't think biden had anything to do
with that
so that probably would have been fine
how about vaccinations
i don't know
are they better or worse as biden
handled the
pandemic better or worse than trump who
knows
um how about afghan pull out
it was literally scheduled under trump's
administration
we we imagined trump would have done
better but we don't know
right so as far as i can tell there's
nothing
there's nothing really here except you
could make an argument for the
infrastructure bill but i think it would
have happened anyway
now do the same thing with trump
did trump accomplish anything that you
say well that was going to happen anyway
no matter who was in charge so trump was
tough on the border
was that going to happen anyway no no it
wasn't going to happen anyway that was
something he did that nobody else was
going to do
how about trump
basically calming down the problems with
north korea
was biden going to do that
no there's no chance biden was going to
have a personal relationship with kim
jong-un which would effectively change
the entire security situation
no and i feel like i could go through
example after example
of something that trump accomplished
that you couldn't really imagine
somebody else doing
that my friends
is why i supported him
not because everything he does is better
than everything anybody else does i've
never believed that
what i believe is that sometimes you
need a disruptor
and it's just good for the system it
could have been a democrat
you know depending on the type of
disruption but sometimes you need
somebody to just go and break
just go just go break everything and
then put it back together
better build it back better
all right
so i got what i wanted and of trump of
course i did not anticipate the degree
of animosity that would be generated i'm
not sure anybody did
which is certainly a negative
all right let's talk about the written
house prosecution
is there any update on that since i
started
i thought they were done with the
closing arguments are they not done with
them i saw i had i saw a headline that
says maybe they were continuing with
them
have we gone to jury yet
can somebody give me an update have they
gone to the jury yet
oh yes they have gone oh it's with the
jury
okay let's talk about this
uh so the written house defense or i'm
sorry the prosecution
has put on a good defense now
everybody's saying that so that's not my
clever idea but it's certainly true
if you look at it it looks like the
prosecution
argued the defense's case
but here are some of the crazy things
they said in closing
that you don't have a right to
self-defense if you're the one with the
gun
what
that's just not true
you know as legal scholars and basically
anybody with a brain
has told you now if the other person is
going to kill you one way or the other
yeah you can shoot him
shoot away
uh and then the
one of the prosecutors in the closing
statement said you know sometimes we all
have to take a beating
what
sometimes we all have to take a beating
yeah sometimes we have to punch things
that's true
but
it may be true that sometimes people get
beatings
but you don't have to take one
if i could give you some advice if you
have a gun and somebody's beating you
viciously
shoot them
that would be my advice
so and then there was the the judge
instructions so here the judge was uh
here's my take
on the judge's instructions i don't
think you're going to see this take
anywhere else
so i want to see if i can convince you
that my take is right are you ready
all right so i don't think you've seen
this but i haven't heard every pundit so
maybe somebody's on the same point
so the judge was giving the
instructions to the to the jury and
started out by saying that
if you find the defendant guilty of the
the top charge you know the most
aggressive one
then you don't need to continue because
the lesser charges are lesser
so if you find the top charge is valid
you know you're done
then he said but
if you find that the top charge is not
valid
and you find here's the key here's the
key phrase
and you find that he acted in
self-defense
then the judge stopped himself
and he couldn't go on
and he realized he'd talked himself into
a trap
which he admitted he said i think i
talked myself into a trap he said it
differently but he admitted he talked
himself into a trap what was the trap
what was the trap
what was the judge realizing he had just
done
i think what he had just done
is basically
told them that if it looked like
self-defense there was nothing else to
think about
now he didn't say
that but it was pretty close to sounding
like that
if it was if you thought it was
self-defense you're sort of done here
now i don't think he meant to say that
right
but
it's true
it's true
meaning that if it looked like
self-defense there's really not much
else to talk about because the gun
charge was thrown out right
so
i feel as if um
he he biased the jury toward an
acquittal in a way that he realized he'd
done as he was doing it and then he
tried to back it out now here's the
problem
there's no evidence of a crime
so the judge and giving his his
instructions
being completely aware
that there's no evidence of a crime at
all
was simply being honest and i think he
realized he couldn't be completely
honest because they just that he just
sat through and presided over
a thoroughly corrupt process
which i think is going to give us give
us the right answer but at least the
prosecution part of it was thoroughly
cropped
i mean i don't know how the prosecutors
don't go to jail
honestly i don't know
i don't understand the process
that the prosecutor doesn't go to jail
for this
how do you not go to
 that prosecutor he belongs in jail
um
quality of persuasion of the closing
arguments uh
i didn't watch them enough but what i
did watch looked like neither none of
them were good
so my take on both the defense and the
prosecution is that none of them were
especially good at their job did you
have the same
impression in fact i would go further
it looked like neither the defense nor
the prosecution were even trained in
persuasion
did you see anything that looked like
they were trained in persuasion
they're trained in the law and you know
there's little persuasion-y stuff in
there but it doesn't look like they know
persuasion
they were just terrible at it really
really terrible in fact both the defense
and the prosecution
kept repeating the other one's case
now i know you have to do that for
context and stuff but the way they were
doing it
it just seemed like it was reinforcing
the other side
i felt like it was terrible in both
cases that was my
that was my take
um
yeah and they made it too boring that's
right so both the
both sides made their presentations too
boring so there won't be any sticky
parts
the uh the secret to having a
uh you know good persuasion
is that the parts
you have to remember that people are
only going to remember ten percent of
what you say
so you gotta make sure that the ten
percent they remember is really really
important right so i don't think that
either side did that
i think they treated it all like it was
just one big soup of stuff
and you you'd be lucky if you remembered
anything in it
yeah johnny cochran would be the the
standard for persuasion
um
i saw a clip of uh tubin on cns cnn
saying that the the judge's instructions
to the jury were all terrible
which sort of sets us up for a riot
doesn't it
because now we have a reason
for thinking it was an illegal trial or
illegitimate and he provided the reason
well the jury instructions were so bad
that the jury didn't know how to come to
a good verdict
it feels like cnn is trying to set us up
now again when i say that i don't mean
that they planned that like they had a
meeting and they said hey let's try to
create a riot i don't think that
i think that everybody just follows the
money
even if they're convincing themselves or
not
so this in a situation like this the
hypnotist would say
all the people are telling the truth
when they they're they think they're
just talking about the news
and if you put them on a lie detector
you'd say are you trying to create a
riot
they would all say no and they would all
pass
the lie detector would find no
you know no sign of
lying
but
as i often tell you
you can always predict where things are
going by following the money
so is it a coincidence that the cnn
people say exactly what will make them
the most money
i don't think so
it's not a coincidence because it
happens always
it's a hundred percent of the time it
never goes the other way
if it sometimes went the other way you'd
say oh that could be a coincidence
but if it never goes the other way
it just means that follow the money
works even when the people don't know
they're doing it
um
what was carpi duncan's msnbc oh msnbc
apparently showed the
uh prosecutors closing statements but
not the defense
now again
if you were to put a lie detector on the
msnbc producers
and he said why did you do that
do you think they'd say you know
we just thought we'd like to
get us a good riot here we'll just show
the prosecution
no no i'll bet nobody had that thought
i'll bet everybody at mss msnbc
simply thought they were making
programming decisions
probably said to themselves well when
the defense is speaking that's our
highest rated show
so we don't want to you know put that
off so we'll wait for a lower rated show
oh that's just when the the prosecution
is talking
i'll bet ya
they could pass a lie detector test
saying that they did it for just regular
programming interest and had nothing to
do with
trying to make anything happen
now i see some people disagreeing
some saying that they absolutely know
what they're doing
could be
you know i'm not going to just actually
i don't think i'll
press that point further
because
i certainly don't have
absolute certainty
that nobody knows what they're doing
here
so this might be a case where they know
exactly what they're doing i'll give you
that
i'll i'll give you that it might be a
case where they know exactly what
they're doing
but
i'll only say that that's not necessary
it's not necessary that they know
they're doing it because it's going to
happen either way
they're going to follow the money
either way
sometimes they know it sometimes they
don't if you think they know in this
case i wouldn't i wouldn't say you're
wrong necessarily
all right
i got this comment from josh jordan he's
a blue check guy on twitter
um and when i said the cnn was trying to
you know maybe start a riot
he said sarcastically yes the tiny cnn
audience is going to start rise because
tuban said the instructions were botched
sarcasm
now here's my first response
it's not the tiny cnn audience that
matters
it's their online presence and the fact
that they give give all the democrats
their talking points
it matters who watches and imagines who
sees the clips and stuff online
so
if you think that cnn's reach is based
on their
live audience it's not it's not based on
that at all in fact i think they use the
live program just to create clips
for their online content
it's mostly a website at this point it's
basically a website does anybody have
any data maybe you can find it while i'm
on here find me the number of viewers
for the
cnn website
uh or their content any way you can find
it versus the number of live viewers
it should be a gigantic difference right
i think there's a gigantic difference
anyway so that's my first complaint
and then josh jordan went on he said
just imagine what could happen if
someone with a real audience like the
president of the united states told
everyone a national election was rigged
oh
so what about that
so trump did tell the nation that the
election was rigged
so i asked this question back to josh i
said
what was he supposed to say if he
believed it was true
and i'll ask you the same question
so many of us
and i would include myself
were not impressed with the way trump
handled the loss
is that fair to say you know you could
be a supporter and still say you don't
like the way he handled the loss you
might not like what he talked about you
know the january 6 stuff you might not
like that he complained as much as he
did about the election being fraudulent
in his
opinion but let me ask you this
what if he believed it was true
well let me let me back up do you think
he believed it's true
do you think that trump
honestly
believes the election was stolen
i do
i think he honestly believes that
now
if he honestly believes it
and at the time he was still president
of the united states
do you want a president who doesn't tell
you that
what is the better situation
is the better situation that he lies to
us
or that he rolls over
did the republicans
elect a lion
or a kitten
if the if republicans had elected a
kitten
then yes they'd be quite happy if he
rolled over
even if he thought he shouldn't
that's what kittens do we elected a
kitten
you don't expect a kitten to put up much
of a fight
but
republicans elected a lion
and they got one
they got exactly what they elected
right
and what's the lions supposed to do
a lion is supposed to be a lion
so
trump
if i had to guess we can't read his mind
but
i'm sure he thinks
i mean i think the odds are really high
that he thinks he won
now
my opinion is it probably had more to do
with the actual legal stuff
behind the scenes before the election
probably less to do with how the
election was counted
but
still a stolen election
it's just stolen legally
so you can steal an election legally
and i think that's exactly what happened
but
i will also add this the thought
that the election system is in a
category
it's in a category of big
complex things
that are somewhat opaque
in other words you and i have never seen
the code for the
you know the electronic parts of the
system right that's invisible to us and
if you ask for the code they wouldn't
give it to you
so our election system is not
transparent
by design it's not even intended to be
transparent
and
there's big money involved you know big
big stakes
so in that situation if it's complicated
it's big and there's lots of money and
it's trans it's not transparent
fraud will happen every time
fraud will happen every time the only
thing you don't know is how much and
whether there was enough this time
so i don't have any i have no proof that
there was fraud that changed the
election outcome
and i i see a troll over on
on youtube
saying that
t rump lost
in capital letters lost
now
i've said that from the start
i said that the system
which we respect even with its flaws we
respect the system the system
elected biden
i accepted it on day one which is
different from whether it should have or
whether it was fair i think but this the
system unfortunately we have to support
the system over the result
if you want
the republic to stay together
sometimes the system is going to give us
the wrong results actually lots of times
but if you tear down the system you have
more trouble than if you
if you argue with the result
so
in my opinion it is unknowable but and
then of course josh came back with the
courts didn't find anything and then i
responded with
the courts are not designed to find
fraud in elections
and in fact they mostly ruled that they
didn't have standing or that it was too
late to ask
so courts didn't make any rulings about
fraud in the election
politics insider which i guess is part
of business insider
uh is saying that bootage is the most
powerful transportation secretary
because he's got this
one point trillion infrastructure bill
that he can dole out
to which i say did i
did i imagine
that biden
appointed a infrastructure czar
did i just imagine that
and is the infrastructures are not the
one who would make all these decisions
that were just attributed to buddha
judge
what am i missing
i'm just confused by the story
did i miss a story that somebody else
was put in charge of this
and who does that person report to maybe
they report to budajet
but it's still going to be somebody else
doing the hard work right
thank you goose
anyway i'm just confused of that because
it's
two stories that are opposites and
they're both in the news at the same
time
um
have i told you before that you should
not reject your opponent's arguments
because that never works
you should get inside them
so here's a persuasion tip again and
i'll give you another example of it you
should get inside
your
opponent's persuasion don't say it's all
wrong
wear it like a suit
and then and then change it from the
inside
now when trump was first running for
president
um he he was accused of not being a
republican enough
right but instead of just being
anti-republican which wouldn't have
worked
he became more republican than the
republicans he basically got inside
their argument
does that make sense
instead of saying no i am i am one he'd
be outside the meant arguing with people
no i am republican i'm republican enough
he became more republican than the
republicans
right
so as soon as he became more republican
than republicans it was hard to say
anything about him
because he was more republican than they
were
he was harder on the border than they
were you know all that stuff
hard to run you know police
wanting police etc
so that's one example of it
let me give you another one and i'll use
it uh about critical race theory
suppose you don't like critical race
theory in school and you're arguing get
that out of my school
what's the other side say
there's no critical race theory in
school
what are you talking about and you say
yes there is yes there is get it out of
there and then the other side says
no no there isn't you white supremacist
no there's nothing here
so you notice how being outside the
argument gets you no traction right
now here's the alternative
get inside the argument
critical race theory
totally
totally uh
totally is not happening
but
do you know what is happening
because the schools are not teaching
critical race theory
so so i'm going to model my argument
here
i agree with you democrats when you say
that there's no critical race theory
being taught in school you are 100
correct
now watch what i'm doing before you
before you react watch what i'm doing
i'm entering the argument i'm not
debating it i'm entering it
yeah
critical race theory no way that's being
taught in schools
there are no examples of it you can't
give me one example of critical race
theory being taught in schools because
critical race theory is above
school level it's sort of a college
level concept and it is not in in
schools
but you know it is
do you know what is in schools
systemic critical race theory there
isn't any direct critical race theory i
totally agree
i'm with you democrats there's no
critical race theory but there is
systemic
meaning that if you were to look at how
the lessons are being taught you can see
it's embedded in the lessons
without the name
so
i started the hashtag
it turns out somebody on the the other
side was using it already but that's
funny
systemic
crt now likewise when
likewise when the democrats say hey
there's lots of systemic racism in the
world
do you say no there isn't we're not a
racist country
because if you do you're losing the
argument
that's a terrible argument
the worst argument is no there isn't
no there isn't there's no critical race
theory
terrible argument
you'll never get an inch with that
argument
instead
get inside it
get inside it
if you get inside it you say yeah
there's systemic racism it's the biggest
freaking problem in the country
and that's honest
because i think that i think systemic
racism is the biggest problem in the
country
as it is expressed by the teachers
unions
see what i did there
first you get inside the argument by
agreeing with it totally you could call
it pacing but i'm going further it's not
just pacing
you have to get inside the argument you
have to you have to wear it like clothes
and then you can do something with it
like you have to put it on like a like a
jacket and then you can move the arms
and stuff right but until you put the
jacket on you got nothing
you're shooting blanks
you know you're just like spitting into
the ocean doing nothing
but as soon as you say yeah can i help
you get rid of this systemic racism and
if you will agree we'll work on the
biggest problems first
who says no to that
who says no to working on the biggest
problem first
nobody
so now you're inside the argument you're
agreeing that systemic racism exists and
you could say are you happy with how
black kids and other people of color are
being taught
nobody says yes
nobody nobody will say yeah it's doing
pretty good
those black students are getting just as
good education as everybody else nope
nope nobody's going to say that
so now you're totally inside the
argument you've identified the biggest
form of systemic racism you got them to
agree
now what can we do about it
it's the teachers unions because they're
the ones preventing
um preventing competition in schools and
without competition nothing works
nothing works without competition
no exceptions
all right so that's how you uh get
inside an argument
um here's a
provocative sexist disgusting opinion
that might nonetheless be accurate
here's where i might get cancelled
i might
let's see
so this is a tweet by a twitter user
named stefan
nobody i know
and on this topic he said teachers
unions are
predominantly female
the problem here is female do good
rhythm
which is properly channeled through
religion and charity
but in this case is being transformed
into a political offensive
he said it not me
now somebody else pointed out that this
was hitler's technique as well
that the hitler youth
was more about the girls
have you ever heard that i've never
heard that before so i can't i can't do
a fact check on it
but uh the idea was that when you
convinced the boys to be like a hitler
youth you know that was uh that worked
but convincing the girls was more
important because they would be raising
the kids
convincing the girls was the important
point because that gets you forever
because they're the ones raising the
kids
right
and when we see that uh women
predominate or
are dominating the teachers unions and
we see that the teachers unions are used
to
um perpetuate perpetuate systemic racism
and keep black people down especially
um
it looks like a woman problem doesn't it
now
uh
let me stop here and say
i i'm not buying into the argument
totally
so i'm not buying into this argument i'm
telling you what the argument is because
i think it's
uh it's provocative enough that it's
worthy to be in the mix
but every time you say it's you know all
about women you're all about men you're
automatically into uh biased you know
bigoted territory right
so i don't want to be in bigoted
territory by saying it's a woman problem
but it is true that women mostly are
responsible for raising kids
that's still true
it doesn't need to be and blah blah
plenty of men are doing that job and
plenty of gay gays are doing it blah
blah but it's still true in general
mostly female raising the kids
all right let's talk about bannon so
bannon refused to uh talk to congress
they find him in contempt
and he turned himself in
and then he uh
he said he
he vowed to topple the biden regime as
he calls it
and uh to make the charges against him a
quote misdemeanor from hell
for the democrats
now he believes that biden ordered
merrick
uh uh
yeah
to uh to go after bannon so he says it's
basically a political political witch
hunt
now
here's the fun part
here's the fun part
um when the democrats go after uh
you know the
founder of barstool sports
they they can they could take a pretty
bite big bite on him although he's doing
a great job of fighting back so i don't
think he's going to get canceled
but
um he's mostly in a defensive stance
wouldn't you say
i mean he's going offense against
specific media groups that went against
him
but mostly he's just trying to survive
um
alex jones is i guess he lost a lawsuit
um that could be really bad for alex
jones and he might it might be that the
the left has taken alex jones off the
field
i don't know that that's true but this
lawsuit that he lost looks pretty pretty
bad
it might
it might just take him off the field but
i don't know
but
do you know what bannon isn't
he isn't one of those people
bannon
has uh let's say let's say bannon's game
is at a different level
and
i think that it's
possibly a gigantic mistake
to give him this much attention
you know what i mean
because his power is going up it's not
going down
if they put bannon in jail for this
he will be the leader of the democrat
he'll be the leader of the republicans
and he's not even asking to be right
he's not even trying
that's sort of not his deal he wants to
be influential but he doesn't need to be
like the top guy but you put him in jail
he turns into nelson mandela
do you know who knows that
bannon
bannon knows that now you can't do that
right he's an energy monster that is
correct
he learned that from trump if he didn't
already know it
but he is anti-fragile
now there aren't too many people like
that
but
if they don't take bannon out he's going
to take them out
so
unlike
you know going after some you know
lesser pundits
if you take a run at alex jones and you
don't take him out
well
it was worth a shot right
yeah it didn't take him out but it was
worth a shot there's no real downside to
that because he's going to say bad
things about democrats no matter what
right
but if you don't take bannon out
you're just making them stronger
and i don't think anybody has quite a
good sense of how strong bannon's game
is at this level
and you're going to be surprised is what
i think so bannon has some surprises
all right
biden had a
zoom call or something like it with
chyna's head
she
and
i don't think he wasn't strong adam
let's just say that
but it turns out that uh china has now
surpassed the united states in wealth
china is the wealthiest country now
now how do you win a war in 2021
is it with bombs
well if if a big power is fighting a
tiny power yes
but what if a superpower is
an adversary to another superpower what
is the weapon of choice
it's money
it's money whoever has the most money is
going to dominate
that's china now
so as long as china has the most money
they are the most powerful influence in
the world because that money can bribe
stuff it can create industries that can
destroy industries it can do anything
money is power
so as long as
china's richer
biden is their and certainly acted
that way
he told his uh he told she biden did
that he has concerns over human rights
abuses
ah
really
he has concerns
wow
i met i'll bet president xi was shaken
oh no i didn't know you had concerns
about my ethnic cleansing
do you know what
concerns about humans rights abuses
somebody needs to tell she to his face
we believe you're involved in ethnic
cleansing of the uyghurs
and the fact that you don't let
international people come and take a
look we consider proof
nobody can say that to sheikh can they
do you know that if hitler
had been in control of more of the
supply chain he would have gotten away
with the holocaust
sorry
it's true
if germany had the same control of the
supply chain as china does right now
they could have done the holocaust
and just gone on
you know that's true
you do
that's what china's doing
they're doing the little holocaust
and they're just
going ahead
nobody cares
do you know that saying never again
well perhaps you know
as people use it they they're referring
to the
jewish situation specifically never
again
but clearly it's going to happen again
because it's happening now and we're
letting it happen and we're okay with it
so that's uh that's your government
right there now i don't know that trump
would have handled it differently
i'd like to think he would but
i don't know that
um and of course then there was the
taiwan question and uh
she warned against i guess
biden warned
china against doing anything
unilaterally or blah blah blah no we
weren't i guess she she warned biden
against doing anything unilaterally
about the status of taiwan
a danish newspaper reported that biden
assured china that u.s recognizes taiwan
to be a part of china
a danish newspaper
reported this as fact
that
biden said yeah china we recognize
taiwan as part of china
now i didn't believe that until i asked
somebody on twitter to send me the
headline
sure enough i mean he'd translate on
google and there it is
yep the
the danes believe that uh
that biden just gave taiwan to china i
mean obviously i'm framing it wrong but
you know what i mean
i like a word with the interpreters
because i wonder if there was an
interpretation problem
you wonder how they could get to that
level of fake news
um
all right rasmussen has a new poll did i
tell you there was going to be something
shocking coming out today
here's something shocking
uh
in a
in a poll there uh people were asked if
they would favor the gop or the democrat
candidate
for the house and the senate in the
midterm elections
and the gop is favored by
13 points
13 point difference
in what voters say they would vote for
in 2022
13 points
and that doesn't count the retirements
because there could be a lot of democrat
retirements apparently that have been
announced towards it were assumed
2022 is just going to be
a tsunami it looks like now
i mean you could say you know you can't
trust polls and there's plenty of time
to go and that's all true
um
but then i also saw that in the same
poll the 30 percent of
black
citizens would vote republican
thirty percent
does that seem high to you apparently
it's been as high as forty percent in
the past
but thirty percent seems high doesn't it
um
yeah
so there's that
all right um
i i told you that quantum computing
might be a problem because it can break
encryption but the smart people in
that world told me that
we now have a encryption that can't be
broken
by the quantum computers
and even the quantum we have now it's a
hundred qubits it'd have to be two
thousand qubits to break our current
current stuff
and that's not going to happen right
away so basically there's a
you know there's a continuous war of the
encrypters versus the you know the
people who can break encryption and so
far the encrypters are ahead
so we don't have to worry that much
about quantum computing breaking
encryption
that is my show for the day i've got to
go do other things
i hope you enjoyed this the
hope you enjoyed the swearing
um overconfidence can be fatal
true
oh actually 50 million qubits you say i
guess it depends which encryption you're
going to try to break that's all for now
i'll talk to you later
