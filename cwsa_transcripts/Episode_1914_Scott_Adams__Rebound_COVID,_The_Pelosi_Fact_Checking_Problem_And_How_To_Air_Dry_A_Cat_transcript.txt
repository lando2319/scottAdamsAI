wrap up
good morning everybody and I'm so proud
of you for making it here on time
uh
because last night was of course a big
party night
but you managed to Rally you Minister
rally good for you if you'd like to take
it up and that's all you need is a cover
Buck or a glass of tanker jealous of
Stein a canteen jug or a flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine to the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous go
ah some good stuff yes if you hadn't
noticed I am wearing my
Voldemort zalenski
president of Ukraine
um disguise
some of you thought you were watching
the actual president of Ukraine no it's
me it's me it's Scott it's Scott I know
it looks exactly like him but uh
let me tell you the weirdest thing that
happened
how many of you have noticed
that the advertisements that you're fed
are based on things you've said how many
people have noticed they were talking
about something out loud and the next
thing you know you get fed that okay
you've all seen that okay all right I
see your answers good all right now next
question
so stop answering that here's your next
question
has anybody had the experience
of only thinking about something and
then seeing the ad serve to you has
anybody yet thinking about it
okay let me give you my example from
yesterday
now I assume it's a coincidence
but let me give you my example which is
not that unusual all right
so yesterday I uh I gave Snickers a bath
I was all alone
and
I don't know if I said anything out loud
that would have suggested bath or
anything else and then I I dried her off
with a towel but you know how hard it is
to dry off a dog with a towel even if
you have infinite towels you for some
reason they don't dry off
right you just can't get the water off
them and then I said to myself wouldn't
it be great
if there were some kind of air dryer
just for the dog because if I use a hair
dryer it's going to be loud and you'll
scare the dog but I thought somebody
should make some kind of a hair dryer
just for the dog
today I open up my Instagram
somebody has developed a dryer for a cat
not a dog
but a cat
and and that actual advertisement was
it's a little uh sort of a box with fans
and you put your cat in the box and it
dries the cat off after the cat gets a
bath
have you ever seen those before
well let me ask this have you ever seen
an advertisement for it in your feed
has anybody ever seen that advertisement
in their feed
I've never seen it and the one day I was
saying to myself wouldn't it be great if
there was some way to dry my dog off
there's a there's a freaking cat dryer
that shows up in my feet I've never seen
that
I I am positive I would remember
if I'd ever seen that even once
now here's my question
is
is social media actually able to figure
out my intentions
like is it did it did it somehow pick up
that I was washing an animal and that
was enough
maybe you did
like I don't know I'm actually just I
don't have a theory about why it happens
could be just reticular activation
if you've ever heard of that term
reticular activation is where if
something's on your mind you notice it
in the environment such as when you buy
a new car
then you notice everybody has that same
card but you've never noticed before
it'll be just that
all right
I'd like to give a shout out for best
prediction I've seen recently
from Twitter account on Hoodwinked
which is a good follow on Hoodwinked is
the name of the account
and after noticing
that three people who took the what's
the name of that uh
therapeutic that people take I think
it's the Pfizer therapeutic for covet
foreign
back slowed it back slow of it right so
on Hoodwinked after noticing that uh Joe
Biden Dr fauci and Professor Peter Hotes
all took that
therapeutic
and he noticed that they all got a
second round of covet sort of what do
they call it the bounce back or the
there's some name for it but you get a
second case
and based on that pattern on Hoodwinked
predicted that the following people
would all have bounce back covet he
actually predicted in advance that Jill
Biden the CEI CEO Pfizer CEO of Pfizer
and the CDC had wolensky he accurately
predicted every one of them would get
rebound I'm sorry he accurately
predicted all three of them would get
rebound covet you predicted that in
public I hahaha
I got all three
now
do you know what was the best health
care uh that I got this year
the best health care I received was that
it was so hard for me to contact my own
health care provider and get Pax lovid
when I got covered that I didn't get it
it was just too much work it was too
hard
so if I could have gotten it easily
pretty sure I would have taken it
I'm pretty sure I would have taken it
now let me ask you
is there anybody here who would have
been comfortable with the
vaccination but uncomfortable with Pax
Lovitt
is there anybody here who thinks the
vaccination would be bad but the
therapeutic would be safer
is that a thing
because they're both you know too
untested not untested they're two drugs
which
everybody including the people who made
them would wish they were more tested if
we had more time
yeah I don't know so it turns out the
smartest thing I did was have a health
care provider who couldn't provide any
health care
am I wrong
you know here's an update on my blood
pressure
so I got off uh I I quit cold turkey
blood pressure medication
which I want to say very carefully you
are not supposed to do
you are not supposed to go cold turkey
on your blood pressure vents that that
is a very not recommended thing so I
want to say that as clearly as possible
don't be like me
nobody copy me don't do it
I was just pissed off
because the day that I stopped taking it
I felt perfectly good after months of
pain
and I thought I'm not putting
that in my body again
do you know what my healthcare provider
recommended
after I found out that the blood
pressure meds were literally killing me
and I mean literally
because they made me suicidal
and if something makes you suicidal and
it makes you not able to exercise
is killing you so that's not too strong
a statement right
it tried it just didn't succeed it tried
to kill me do you know what my doctor
recommended
double the dose
double the dose
because the uh because my blood pressure
had not been adequately controlled
because I gave some readings and they
weren't controlled enough
so I was asked to double the dose
what do you think I'm doing
do you think I'm going to double the
dose
no way no now I'm having a
little issue with my health care
provider because my doctor is on on
leave so there's a whole communication
problem that's not normal my actual
doctor is great
so let me be clear there's no way my
doctor would have made that
recommendation what happened is it went
through a third party
and by the time it got to me the
communication had been lost that instead
of trying to get more of it I was trying
to get rid of it entirely so that just a
communication problem but that's that's
my current health care my current health
care is too inconvenient to use it
literally it's too inconvenient to
actually use it I actually choose
to treat myself
and so far I've done better
that's that's a fact
so far I've beat my health care provider
in performance by ignoring them
I hate to say it but it's true all right
so yesterday I took my uh
blood pressure this is after a week of
no blood pressure meds
pretty dangerous right how do you think
I did after a week of
no blood pressure meds
there you go
oops
damn it there's my readings
how did I do after after having no blood
pressure meds
right 115 over 79 and 120 over 77.
do you know I did instead of taking
blood pressure meds asked me how I did
it
I took a 20-minute walk
and I cut down on coffee
that's it
I read somewhere that if you take two
30-minute walks a day you're basically
fine
and I wondered if that's actually true
and so I thought okay I won't do like a
full exercise
I'll do a nice
nice little slightly challenging you
know just a brisk walk
and then I sit down and test my blood
pressure and I got perfectly normal
after a week with no blood pressure meds
now let me be clear
this I probably hit a low Point yeah
this might have been my low for the day
I do think I have a problem with spiking
during the day
but let me ask you this
can you refer to the science and tell me
if that puts me in danger
look at the science and tell me if you
know that you know I can get down to
good blood pressure some part of the day
but it might be spiking other parts of
the day what is my risk
nobody knows
nobody knows that there's there's no
science that could tell you that at all
right but if you talk to your doctor
they'll I'm sure they'll tell you that
they have some
firm ideas about that but they'd be
guessing I think
so I know I'm setting myself up for
karma to give me some health problem
because of my high blood pressure we all
know that right but I feel like I'm
doing
some kind of a public good here that's a
little bit bigger than me
which is if I don't die and I
successfully manage my blood pressure
into a healthy zone just with lifestyle
wouldn't you like to know that
wouldn't you like to know if that's a
thing that works I mean I'll just be one
person so it's not like a study or
something but wouldn't you be curious
and I figure I'm going to take the
chance for all of us right I mean I
probably would do it for myself but it
has a bigger value to you maybe
we'll see
um
if you were on the locals platform you
would be seeing my naughtier cartoon
called robots read news in which robots
read the news now normally you on
YouTube could not see these Comics but
um this particular one that I published
yesterday which features just a robot
reading the news
has a humor technique in it I would like
to teach you
and this is one that's really easy
this is one you could all incorporate
immediately and become funnier you all
want to be funnier right
it's called the the list of three
list of three
there there is something about a list of
three concepts or things that if you
pick the right three is funny
and you know it when you see it right so
what makes it funny is three things that
don't normally Belong Together usually
and and there's something about the
bleed over of one item into the other
that isn't part of the point but it
bleeds over that makes it funny because
your brain is trying to make it make
sense and it's it's not quite making
sense for you all right so I'm going to
read you the joke
and then I'm going to explain the what I
did so you can see it so look for the
list of three three things that don't
belong together but it's funny when you
put them together right
so the first two panels are one joke and
then then I just do a completely
separate joke of the third panel so the
robot says the government released a new
covet advisory today
it says quote to stay one mile from CDC
director Rachelle wolenski
because she got covert yet again
the third panel is just a new joke and
the and the robot says in our in our
tips for humans segment tonight's tip is
never sleep in your underpants if your
gun is a hammer
never sleep in your underpants
if your gun is a hammer
all right now here's why this works
Underpants gun hammer
Underpants gone
hammer
you put those three together
I don't care what else you say about
them
you see do you see it you can't put
those three words together and not laugh
right
as soon as you hear him you're like okay
Underpants gun Hammer I'm done
Underpants gun Hammer there's nothing
else you need to say
that's it right you can make your own
joke
you could put any other words around
them
there are about a hundred different ways
you can make that funny I just picked
one right so there's your your tip
now if you're saying to yourself but
Scott
how would I know that those three went
together and were funny that's not the
way it works
what you do is you just cycle a bunch of
words through your head until one of
them makes you laugh one combination
makes you laugh and when it makes you
laugh it'll probably make other people
laugh
so here's why it's hard
for AI to write humor this is a perfect
example
the way I wrote this joke is the first
time I thought of it it made me laugh in
my head
as soon as I thought of those three
words together I was like okay these
three words are one of those that's one
of those three word combos
but the only way I knew it worked for
you
is that it made me laugh and AI can't do
that
so the AI can't test its own joke on
itself because it doesn't have a sense
of humor yet
so that's the only Advantage I have
right now is that I can a B test faster
than the fastest computer
how long is that going to last
right because the computer will
eventually beat me by testing with lots
of humans
fairly quickly just send out a query
what's funnier this or that
and you're like that one and then it
knows what people think is funnier
so that's your tip for the day
all right
um
so what did when did Twitter get an edit
button
because I saw one today that's only for
the special people right some people are
testing it
can you confirm that because the edit
button worked exactly the way I would if
it's not for blue checks it's you have
to be on Twitter blue meaning you're
paying money for it right
yeah you don't have an edit button so
it's the first time I saw one today
and I don't know if you remember but I
was describing how I would have designed
it it turns out they designed it exactly
like I would have
which I assume is a coincidence but the
way I would have done it is you have to
show the history
so it just shows a little tag that says
it's an edited tweet and as soon as I
saw the tag which was notable I mean it
wasn't it was easy to see the tag I
clicked on it and it showed me that
there was a typo in the first tweet
and then I was all happy
I was totally happy
because it was my choice to look at the
edit I didn't have to and when I looked
I said oh he used it for this reason it
wasn't you know typo perfect
to me that was perfect
could you how would you improve on that
you can't improve on that that's that's
as good as the edit button can be
designed
so I think you'll see that I'd be
surprised if they don't roll that out
for the rest of us
so did you see uh there was a tweet by
uh Stephen King Author Stephen King
and he said uh it had been floated the
idea of charging blue check people
twenty dollars a month
and uh King tweeted twenty dollars a
month to keep my blue check that
they should pay me if that gets
instituted I'm going like Enron
now here's what I just absolutely love
about Twitter and about this time and
in our world
so Stephen King tweets this tweet about
Twitter and he gets an almost immediate
reply from Elon Musk
now so probably the most prolific or I
don't know financially successful author
in America of all time I'm guessing
probably
um gets a direct tweet from the richest
man in the world
and then we can all watch it
the the transparency of all this is just
amazing but what musk tweets back is he
goes we need to pay the bill somehow he
goes Twitter cannot rely entirely on
advertisers he goes how about eight
dollars
now how awesome is that
you actually watched the richest man in
the world you know the most successful
entrepreneur we've ever seen negotiating
in public
with our most famous prolific author of
fiction
and
and something could come of it you know
if King actually gave his opinion it
could actually matter
like if King said you know
I could do eight dollars
but you know what's the funniest thing
about this
you lose sight of the fact that the
richest man in the world and the richest
author in the world are arguing whether
eight dollars a month or twenty dollars
a month is the right price
there are no two people in the world who
could care less about the difference
between eight and twenty dollars
but yet it's happening
I mean everything about this is
interesting just the fact that we can
observe it in real time
um have you ever seen a famous person
that accessible
I mean musk is so accessible he's I mean
he's responded to my tweets a few times
he's responded to people I know
several times
you know it feels like if you make a
tweet that actually has Merit
he actually sees it in response to it
it's kind of a phenomenal time in
history
um
I saw something that confused me at
first but then it all made sense
and let me explain it to you
do you know how uh I think Dan bongino
was pointing out recently how Biden had
been fact checked all summer
we went like a whole summer in CNN's
fact Checker just disappeared
and then it became a little embarrassing
because people noticed that they just
stopped fact checking and then today I
looked at a cdnance page and they're
down in sort of a hard to find place
was a fact check of Joe Biden and it was
Daniel Dale the fact checker for for CNN
and he fact checked Biden's lie
about what gas prices were on average
when he took over from Trump
so I guess Biden had been saying the gas
prices were five dollars on average when
he took over from Trump
which is not even close to true it's not
even it's not even in the neighborhood
of true it's just like an amazing lie
so were you surprised
that that CNN would fact check Biden's
Claim about the gas now when apparently
they've been not fact checking anything
for months does that surprise you
suddenly when even when we're closer to
the midterms we're closer to the
midterms of these fact checking
doesn't surprise you at all
uh let me give you a related story
that will explain to you why CNN's fact
Checker suddenly is on the job
right now watch me tie these two
unrelated stories together and see if
you make the connection without my help
I think you will I think this was an
easy one okay totally unrelated story
uh did you hear that Paul Pelosi was hit
by a crazy guy with a hammer
yeah and have you heard that the the
political right
is um
creating a bunch of stories that let's
say don't have factual proof
suggesting that Paul Pelosi was maybe in
a a gay relationship with the attacker
now is that the sort of story that the
Democrats want to stay out there as
something that might have been true
no no
no that's the sort of story that you
might want what's the word the phrase
two words what what do you think the
Democrats would want to do with a story
like that
they'd want to
fact jacket
would they want to
fact check it
now how do you fact check something when
your fact Checkers gone
how do you do that
huh wouldn't it be great in a situation
like this if you were seeing that
wouldn't it be great to have a fact
checker who could come in here and fact
check that thing away make sure that
that gay rumor goes away
well as luck would have it Daniel Dale
has made a big appearance and in a major
piece he's fact checking this Paul
Pelosi stuff and says it's all it's all
unfounded
now
could Daniel Dale come back and do a big
fact check on the Pelosi story while
completely ignoring everything that
Biden's done all summer
nope that would be a little bit obvious
wouldn't it
so he's got a little bit of a
a little bit of a fact check on on Biden
just a little one
yeah we were just just gas prices just a
little one
so that gives him cover
for doing the big one that they really
need to get done right they can bury the
Pelosi thing
right now is it a coincidence that you
just appeared and he fact checks Biden
after months of no fact checking at just
the right time when they needed that
other fact check
now how many of you would have noticed
that
would you have noticed the pattern
somebody did right yeah I I think that I
think that many of you
are now so sophisticated in watching the
news that you can you can see the
pattern
you know even before you can see the
fake news
like you could you we all know that wrap
up smear now right we know how the wrap
up smear works we know how you know
they'll the the Democrats will release
something like as a
to a news entity that's friendly and
then they'll refer to the news entity to
prove the thing that was the rumor they
made up you know the wrap up smear so
once you understand the patterns
everything just is so much more clear
now
here's what's interesting
with that little move
they made it impossible for Biden to
become president if whoever runs against
them
decides to be even a little bit smart
here's how it goes
and I'm doing the media's job Forum but
you can imagine a candidate taking this
attack too so imagine Peter Ducey asking
the president's spokesperson this
uh the president ran for office
promising to remove a liar from Office
you know so Biden ran for office
to remove that liar from office
that was a major theme
but he also says the price of gas was
more than five dollars when he took
office which has been fact-checked as
false
by by CNN
so I would ask the question which one of
those is true
did he really run for office to remove a
liar from office or is he lying now
about the gas price
and I would and I would ask that
question
Now isn't that fair
that's a fair question right a major
theme of this campaign
was I will get rid of that liar
but a major theme of his current
governing is a gas was five dollars a
gallon when he took over
now that's an easily debunkable fact
but it's also unique you know what's
unique about the gas price claim
what's unique about it is it it's the
most debunkable thing you could debunk
there's nothing that would be easier to
debunk because it's just like a a
statistical fact that anybody can look
up basically so
here's what I do if I were debating
Biden I'd say the same thing you ran for
office because you wanted to put honesty
in the office you're also your major
claim in your office is that gas was
five dollars when you took over
pick one
either you care about the truth
or your your you know there's something
wrong with this gas price thing I would
make I would make uh Biden see the
trouble is if you go for the fine people
hoax which would be another example of
him lying you can't fact check that
because the fact Checkers would say it
didn't happen which they do you know of
course they're lying it obviously did
happen you can watch it yourself you
don't have to even rely on the fact
Checkers but the because Daniel Dale
fact-checked the gas price thing you can
use it that's sort of like a lawyer
knows not to ask a question he doesn't
already know the answer and you don't
want something introduced into the trial
during the trial because you're not
ready for that right you don't want to
accidentally introduce a thing that
you're not ready to deal with
so I think that Daniel Dale accidentally
put this into evidence
that the president is in fact lying
about something that would be easy to
fact check it's a major point I mean
it's a big point right and it's the
opposite of the biggest claim he made
during his presidency that he would
bring you the truth
so I would make him the answer to that
and only that and I wouldn't even bring
up anything else I just say look
just tell us if you're real
right now you might say to yourself how
is that going to work if he's running
against Trump
because he's just gonna say but Trump
had you know 10 million fact check
problems
but you know what's different
Trump actually run Trump actually ran
telling you that he likes to use
hyperbole to get the job done
he told you he would be a cheerleader
for the country
he didn't tell you he was going to be
the most honest president you ever had
he never once made that claim did he
did Trump ever say I'm going to bring
honesty and fact-checking to the
presidency he absolutely did not he did
not but Biden did
so if you're going to compare the two
you've got one person who says of course
I use hyperbole all the time it works
really well and I'm going to use it for
you I'll use it on your benefit I'll run
the country using hyperbole just the way
I did my business
and then you look at what he did and
it's like sure enough
sure enough he ran the country on
Hyperbole and it it worked pretty well
just like he said it would
Biden said he'd run it on honesty but
use lying instead
you can call him on that
you can call him
all right
um
let me test a claim with you I don't
believe that people on the right
actually believe that Paul Pelosi was
maybe engaged in a gay tryst
you're just having fun right
you don't actually believe that do you
can somebody tell is there anybody here
who actually believes
or is it you're just having fun
okay oh somebody says they do
all right very I think very few people
actually entertain that as a probability
you know I I suppose I'd put it in the
category of anything's possible Right
but pretty unlikely pretty darn unlikely
now you have to be careful because
here's where you need to be careful
because this now becomes a famous
conservative hoax
and you've given ammunition to the
Democrats
so what you got out of that was a funny
story
with no political value whatsoever right
there's nobody in the world who would
vote differently
based on the Paul Pelosi story right
nobody would vote differently if
anything they would have some empathy
for them
I would think
so there's no benefit to this conspiracy
theory if you want to call it that
but there's definitely a downside the
downside is that the other side says
look you're a bunch of liars
you know don't be on that team it's a
bunch of liars
but at some point I think the
conservatives need to admit they're just
having fun
and I think at some point
you know you might need to admit that
collectively not you specifically in
order to get past it because you've
created a problem for yourself you
conservatives because now you've painted
yourself as conspiracy theory theorists
when in fact I think you were just
having fun
like as far as somebody's expense so we
could argue how ethical that was
but you can't argue that it wasn't fun
yeah unfortunately we're complicated
people
does anybody have a problem holding in
their head simultaneously
that you have genuine empathy for Paul
Pelosi I know I do
at the same time is funny
you could have both of those feelings
and I and you could have them fully I
think I think you can be fully
human and have empathy at the same time
if it makes you laugh it makes you laugh
right I wouldn't be laughing if he
hadn't survived and I wouldn't be
laughing if he'd been permanently
crippled right that wouldn't be there's
nothing I could find in that but he is
tragic as it was and you know traumatic
and wish it hadn't happened
I can't help the fact that people are
normal and they
they laugh at funny things like
Underpants and hammers
all right
so um but just if you hadn't heard the
whole
are you trying to understand why
the story said that Paul Pelosi called
him a friend
are you trying to understand why that
could be true at the same time it's true
that they didn't know each other
because Paul Pelosi is not on record as
saying that
only only one of the dispatchers had
that characterization but there's no
record of Paul Pelosi saying that and
both he both Pelosi and the the other
person with the hammer they both say
they didn't know each other
and they both have the same story
now that would be pretty rare
because they're not exactly on the same
team right but they both have a
consistent story that it's it was an
invasion news about something about
Nancy now here's the second part you
need to know
it was definitely political
do you agree with that yet I don't know
what news you've seen or not saying but
it was definitely political
I I see the right trying to explain it
away as crazy
well he's crazy too
but he left a very clear path that it
was a you know it was a political act
there's no doubt about it
all right so I I'm happy that almost all
of you are on the same page on this
because I would be a little worried
um somebody's saying I'm a boomer
because I believe the narrative now what
I think is that the thing that's most
likely is most likely
that's all
if it turns out I'm wrong that wouldn't
be the first time but I'm saying that
the ordinary explanation is completely
available to you you don't need an
extraordinary explanation for something
that's ordinary now I would say there's
there's one thing left
which is
um why was the glass on the outside of
the window
and I can give you several ways that
that might be explained
now I'm not saying these are the actual
Reasons I'm only going to give you an
example of how you could understand it
without actually knowing what the
explanations all right
number one
how many times have you seen a story
like this where you know you saw a
picture of the break-in and then he
found out later it wasn't even the right
house
that's like an ordinary thing like the
news might have shown a picture of the
wrong house
now I don't think that happened
but that's in the category of these
things right that wouldn't even be right
it wouldn't even be unusual it could
have been photoshopped right
so you don't even know if the photo is
real would you agree I think the photo
Israel all right if I had to guess but
would you agree that you can't rule out
a fake photo
you can't rule it out because it's
actually so ordinary and so common
that in the initial fog of War how often
is it in Ukraine for example that they
ran
military actions from other Wars you saw
a bunch of that very common
all right here's another way it could
happen
there was uh
a breakthrough that caused that allowed
him to get in
and then there was just something else
that happened that also sent some glass
right here's another one
let's say you've got a claw you've got a
claw hammer and you're trying to break
in you break through with a hammer
but the hammer leaves uh you know a
discreet hole
is the next thing you do to keep
hammering it or with the next thing you
do grab the claw into the into the
weakened glass and pull it toward you
which would you do
you could imagine
that if there was like a hole the hammer
hole but you saw the glass was weakened
you could imagine that you would just
pull in the claw and pull it out
right now I'm not saying that happened
I'm not making that claim I'm just
saying they're probably
five different ways this could happen
all right here's another one
you break the window and it doesn't
doesn't get rid of all the glass and the
pain
and then you then you yank open the
window
and the rest of the glass falls out
after you've already opened it you've
opened the door
so now you've got glass on the inside
from the initial break Plus Glass on the
outside because when you yank the door
some more glass came down
now I'm not saying that happened either
but can you see how easily you could get
glass on the outside without being weird
right without being weird
it's pretty easy
so I don't know if any of those are true
but I would say that everything is
explained
the the reason he was called the friend
Pelosi there's no evidence he ever said
that there's only evidence that the
dispatcher believed he heard it
how often does somebody misquote
somebody else
in your experience
how often does somebody accurately quote
somebody else in a let's say high
emotion situation
almost never they always get it wrong
the most common thing in the world is
for a third party to misinterpret you
how many times does a third party
misinterpret me
every day
all day long my Twitter feed is full of
people misinterpreting something I said
but they think they're right as the
dispatcher probably thought he or she
was right
yeah all right I think I was explained
most of that
um you know I didn't talk about too much
of the story about we know now
that the Department of Homeland Security
and the FBI
were coordinating with the social media
platforms to Tamp down on disinformation
now it's being treated like a new story
I thought we knew this for a long time
all right is there anybody who didn't
know the social media companies were
talking to the government about
disinformation
we did but we forgot this isn't a new
story right
it's only that we saw it in writing
somewhere else
yeah yeah Zucker admitted it so I don't
understand the story there's nothing new
right we all know this is the thing
you know you know what's hard about this
story is I don't know if I don't want it
to happen
if the only thing you knew is that the
government was talking to social media
about what what how to handle
disinformation if that's the only thing
you knew
it's not automatically bad
it becomes bad because the government's
involved and everything it touches it
ruins
but in the at the concept level is that
a problem that your government is
concerned about misinformation
during a pandemic
foreign
yeah it can become a problem
I don't know that the Instinct was
necessarily a hundred percent evil you
know there might have been a little bit
of good intentions involved there but
you know the evil gets in the tent too
right
yeah once the evil gets in there's
nothing to do to get it out yeah so I
would agree with you that it's a bad
idea
I don't think it's obvious that it was
always about bad intentions but clearly
the bad intentions got wrapped into this
concept clearly
all right
yeah you know and you could also Imagine
a good way to handle it and a bad way to
handle it
um here here's the good way the good way
to handle it is to say social media
companies you should have a feature
where if somebody makes a claim that's
false
that you can easily associate it with
the correct claim
would that be a problem to you
because I've said social media should do
exactly that they should make it easy
well actually no let me change it not to
the correct claim to the counterclaim
that's where it's different all right
here's where we differ I I don't think
you should have a service that tells you
what's true
I think you should have a service that
exposes you to the counter claim that's
the difference would you agree
you don't want the government saying
what's true
but if the only thing they did is say
make sure that the you know the true
information also gets surface surfaced
the true as we think it's true make sure
the counter claim gets surfaced that
would be okay with me but that's not
what they did is it I don't think that's
exactly what they did
but but there is a good version of it
how many of you have ever heard of
something called the fine structure
constant
are there any nerds here science nerds
the fine structure constant
so somebody directed me to it this
morning to break my brain
and it did it broke my brain a little
bit now I don't I don't fully understand
it but I'll tell you the best I can
there's this number 137.
which maybe coincidentally maybe not is
a prime number
that pops up in physics too often
and there's another quality to it that I
don't understand
there's some kind of
measureless quantity the thing to it
that I don't I don't understand
but it comes up way too often
and scientists don't know why
and why why would that be a constant
and to my mind
it's probably proof of the simulation
it's probably proof of the simulation
so let me give you an example of why you
would need a constant for a simulation
years ago when personal computers were
brand new
I tried to learn Computing on my own or
programming on my own because I wanted
to see if I could build my own video
game
and I did I succeeded so I learned
enough that I made a video game that
featured the the uh
the space shuttle but it had laser
cannons in the game and it could shoot
down Soviet Satellites back when the
Soviet Union was a thing so I actually
created a game
now here is the problem
I was such a bad programmer
that I created a game that worked
perfectly on my computer you see the
problem right
the very next computer I bought was
faster
and so the speed of the game
became the speed of the processor
what I really needed was that the speed
of the game always stayed the same no
matter what processor was running on
so in other words
I needed a constant
I needed a constant I needed some some
number or a constant that no matter what
processor I'm running on the game looked
the same
the fact that this 137 constant shows up
all over the place
and it tells me that we're we're a game
we've been designed
with a constant that will keep now I
don't know if it's keeping the speed
constant
maybe it's that because you if we're a
simulation we we may move from one
processor to another without even
knowing it and all the processors need
to operate
in in a similar fashion
I feel like the constant is so that the
simulation
treats everything in the simulation the
same at the same time
just the hypothesis I'll just put that
out there
so did you hear that Russia exited
the grain deal where they're going to
allow safe passage of the grain from
Ukraine uh out uh is it the Black Sea
yeah the Black Sea and
then Russia pulled out of the deal
because Ukraine sent a bunch of uh I
guess
water drones and attacked the fleet so
Russia's Fleet got a big attack a few
days ago based on drones
and there's actually some video from one
of the drones
which is I can't imagine wanting to be
in the water when one of those drones is
there because you can see it like
speeding toward the boat and then you
see the anti-drone
defenses and it's like goes around them
and stuff I'm like holy if you had
enough of these aquatic drones I think
you could take out just about any
warship
because it
so here's a guy Smithson says Scott
duped again only ex only exit a deal
because Ukraine bombing ships
all right
um I have to pause again for another
 idiot
so this is only a message for
idiots everybody else you can ignore
this
anything I ever say about Ukraine you
should assume is very low credibility
because all sources Russian and
Ukrainian have no credibility
got it
so if you'd like to send it if you'd
like to put a comment in here that says
Scott doesn't know
information from the Ukraine war is low
credibility
well you would be wasting your
time
because we all know that
guy did nothing wrong
all right so we're done with you
um so again we don't know what's true
but the story is
that Russia was using the attack as her
excuse for saying they're pulling out of
the deal
and they said we can allow the grain to
go out if Ukraine will agree to stop
destroying our Navy
and as other people have pointed out
uh we've come a long way from Russia is
going to conquer Ukraine in 24 hours or
whatever the hell it was
they've gone all the way to please don't
destroy our Navy
that actually is happening
Russia is basically trying to negotiate
to not have their Navy destroyed because
it looks like Ukraine could just use
these uh these drones I don't know how
fast we can make drones and ship them to
them but I bet we can make them and ship
them to them faster than they can make
battleships or destroyers or whatever
were blown up
so I think that Russia's Naval
superiority is over
and it turns out I didn't know this
until today but apparently turkey has a
massive Naval Force there as you know
makes sense it's their backyard
so apparently uh turkey just said well
we are gonna
we are going to ship this grain so
turkey and Ukraine just decided they're
going to ship some grain whether Russia
likes it or not and Russia decided to
let it go because they don't want to
 with the the Turkish navy
apparently
now I don't know if that's true like
remember every part of this
is low credibility but that's the story
of today
all right
yeah so it's funny how the news
continues to describe
uh Russia as poor and incompetent and
you know paper tiger and all that stuff
I don't know if any of that's true
I really don't
all right
what else is fun
uh
so I'll I'm going to file this under
everything that they told you was
 and whoever they is or anybody
in charge
any expert everything they told you
 here's the here's one for today
did you know that uh
plastic isn't really recycled
I can't believe I'm saying that get all
those plastic bottles
I carefully separate them and recycle
them
foreign
no not recycle
in fact they end up in garbage in uh
Asian countries I think and then it gets
into the water supply and it kills us
all
so apparently the worst thing you can do
is recycle your plastic bottles you
should throw them in the regular trash I
learned this from Michael schellenberger
in a tweet today I'd never heard this
before
now I'll tell you what I had heard
I remember years ago there was an expose
where they showed a video of all of the
recycling stuff taken to a central place
and they all got it ended up in the same
garbage with everything else
but I I remember thinking well that's
probably a an exception
or maybe it's early in the recycling
phase but but eventually you know we
will in fact be recycling everything
because you know everybody's trying so
hard to do it
but apparently we never got there
I think only two percent or something of
plastic is recycled because it must be
hard to do
and I just gets thrown away so
schellenberger says the worst thing you
can do is recycle your plastic you
should throw it in the regular garbage
and let it get incinerated or whatever
the hell happens to it
I don't know I can't even imagine that's
better I don't know anything is better
it sounds like plastic is just poison
all right so don't believe anything
anybody tells you all right here's some
Rasmussen polling information so we're a
week before election day for the
midterms
and half of Voters say inflation and the
economy are the most important issues
right so 26 percent of likely voters say
inflation is the most important issue
and uh 22 percent
coming in a strong second say the
economy is the top issue
that's right
so we're separating inflation
from the economy in this
in this polling situation here
now
should people who can't tell that
inflation is part of the economy should
they be allowed to answer polls
maybe people who can't tell that
inflation really is the economy
maybe they shouldn't be allowed to
answer polls
all right
I'm just kidding so actually the way the
poll was answered there was a reasonable
way to answer it right it was actually
reasonable because they asked is based
on asking what's the top issue
and so if some people pulled inflation
out of the economy and said that's the
top issue that's not crazy
but
it does tell you that it's basically the
economy right the economy is all anybody
cares about not anybody I'm exaggerating
but here's a number that surprised me
um of the
uh now this is a ranking of what people
think is most important uh only 19 say
abortion rights
19 that's still a lot that does seem
like enough to move an election eight
percent say climate change
eight percent say violent crime
does that seem right
now eight percent say violent crime
actually makes sense because that's how
many people
probably are in dangerous places
where I live I still don't have a big
violent crime problem although it's
definitely ticking up you know even
where I live it's taken up there's some
home invasions in the neighborhood and
stuff but
uh I don't think about it on a
day-to-day basis
like in my daily travels I don't really
ever think about crime
but probably about eight percent of the
country lives somewhere where it's all
they have to think about
so and maybe more than that because
those are the the city centers but it
still seems like a low number I'm
surprised that's not bigger
and only two percent of uh people say
that Ukraine or LGBT rights matter to
them in terms of ranked at the top
so
here's the good news
I feel like people have their priorities
right
don't you
I would be worried if one of these
lesser issues happen to be at the top
is that good news
it feels like it doesn't it it feels
like good news that when we look at the
list of priorities
we're kind of all on the same page in
the country
we have different ideas what to do about
it but I feel like that's unusual that
we're even on the good we're even on the
same side
of what the problem is
that's a little bit unusual isn't it
maybe it maybe it suggests something
good isn't going to happen
but uh
the illegal immigration was only the
most important thing to I guess eight
percent
you know what's weird about illegal
immigration
here's what I can't understand
I don't understand where why the impact
of it on my day-to-day life is not
bigger
is anybody else having that or maybe
it's like a huge impact in some small
areas
right now I don't live on the border so
if I lived if I lived on the border I'd
be probably complaining every day but
why does that problem
not spread faster from the border right
I'm in a border state
but I'm in the northern part of the
border state and here I don't really see
I'll tell you the only place I see the
impact is there are a number quite a few
students
who are shall we say undocumented
immigrants
so a lot of the students in the schools
are clear there but
it doesn't affect people too much
you know they make friends they they
stay with their their group
uh it doesn't seem to make much
difference
where I am
Health Care is overloaded well maybe
that's why I can't get health care
effectively
so that's a good point but I wouldn't
know that that's why I think that's more
about a staffing problem isn't it
I think healthcare is more of a staffing
problem but I'm not sure
all right
so I'm just going to make the comment
that everybody everybody feels the
economy and everybody feels inflation
but the poll I think reflects that not
everybody feels anything about
immigration
most people I think don't feel the
direct immigration effect although it's
probably affecting us in a big way
indirectly and then the Sentinel thing
you might connect with that right
exactly
um
Supreme Court is listening to this case
about racial discrimination in college
admissions
yeah I guess Harvard and University of
North Carolina are arguing that they
should be able to use a race in part of
their decision making about who to who
to bring in and I guess it's Asian
Americans who were the uh the victim
class in these lawsuits
or these actions and
here's something that I didn't know a
little background that's very
interesting
so there was a case in 2003 uh grunter
versus Bollinger
in which uh justice Sandra Day O'Connor
wrote and I guess that was the thing
that allowed
colleges to use race and admissions so
in 2003 there was a case that gave them
the cover to use race and admissions
and then even when that decision was
made
25 years ago Sandra Day O'Connor said
that probably you wouldn't need this in
25 years
you wouldn't need it in 25 years
and it's it's 19 years from then
that was a pretty good call
to talk about a good prediction that was
a hell of a prediction
and also I would argue that's the best
of America right there
that's the best of America
because that was a 25-year plan to fix
something
with an understanding that once it got
fixed you needed to you know you needed
to adjust again damn
you know if I'd known
that that was a sort of a 25-year
expectation now it's not a binding kind
of thing it was just a prediction
but that would have felt different to me
than imagining it's some permanent
condition
it would have felt different
so good job Sandra Day O'Connor on that
prediction but we'll see if it makes any
difference we'll see if she's right
Harvard apparently wants to use race
forever
even if they reached some kind of parity
they just always want to use it and it
sounds like the argument in favor of
keeping it is weak
so it's hard to know how the court will
rule based on the questions they ask but
so far it looks like
it's going to be overturned
and I think race will not be
allowed as a
you know too old for admissions
uh
overturning is probable yeah now that's
what you get with your uh
your conservative court right there's no
way this would get overturned with a
liberal Court wouldn't you agree
I think so
all right well we'll see what happens
there all right ladies and gentlemen
um it's another wonderful day in which
we'll be waiting for Elon Musk to make
us some more news
because he's in charge of making news
now and if he doesn't tweet today I
don't know what I'm going to talk about
um
yeah sun sun set it exactly
you know what I I think if you're going
to get rid of racial preferences
in colleges
um I feel like it should be accompanied
with some kind of like a celebration
and like a congratulations to Black
Americans in particular
because
correct me if I'm wrong
did not black Americans fight for you
know exactly this sort of thing for the
last 19 years and did it not help them
probably did probably helped a lot
and
you know if you reach a point where that
the help has reached a sufficient level
if black Americans were willing to
release on that
that would go a long way
for you know racial Harmony
wouldn't it
is this is one of those opportunities
where saying the right thing could make
such a difference
how would you feel about
people who you know use racial
preferences to get into college you're
probably saying uh I'm a you know I
understand why it exists I understand
the history of it but ah isn't it time
to do away with that so you don't like
the racial preferences it gives you a
bad feeling about maybe people who
benefited from it it's sort of automatic
but I suppose the people who benefited
from it said thank you very much
we appreciate it and now now we can
release on it
that's George Washington level
and it's not going to happen imagine
imagine having a a really good black
leader like a Martin Luther King type
imagine Martin Luther King saying you
know what
thank you
damn thank you thank you for 19 years of
helping to make this more even and in
return
in return we're going to release it
we're going to we're going to George
Washington and we're gonna we're gonna
walk away when we didn't need to we
could have fought to keep it but we're
going to say just say thank you
and and fight other fights together
because the next fight that the black
and rest of the world needs to fight is
teachers unions
so imagine a world in which we declare a
collective victory in the the college
area but don't you know don't don't give
up on making sure that everybody's got a
chance to go to college right if that
even makes sense anymore but say how
about that was great how about we work
together and we got that done
and how about that was just awesome
and how about now we've reached a
different point in time we both agree
that that's just a thank you situation
that's it that's just thank you
and then we then we work together to
solve the next biggest problem which is
correct me if I'm wrong
if you fix the lower level schools
you don't need
to have your colleges be biased because
then they just accept everybody who did
a good job in school and then
everybody's happy
or close to it
yeah the in terms of persuasion
gratitude is one of the strongest
pieces of persuasion you can ever use
when somebody shows gratitude it
completely changes how you treat them
right
if somebody just asked for something and
they've got an attitude like you owe it
to them
you're going to do everything you can
not to give it to them
but if somebody is like really genuinely
thankful
you actually feel good too they give
something and then you get something and
then everybody's happy like that's a
perfect world
so but but think about it think about
imagine if the the court case goes the
way I guess it will go
and it actually says that was great for
19 years but now we need to make an
adjustment
should we treat that as we lost
something because because I fear that
I fear that we'll treat it like a loss
or half the country will treat a lot of
gloss that that should be treated like
wow that really worked now let's work
together on the next other problem and
then and then have a victory after that
as well
so maybe we have some opportunity for
the Golden Age Maybe
yeah dream on you're right Dream On
I would argue that the biggest thing
that the black community in America
Lacks
is a capable leader
would you agree with that
if I ask you who's the the leader of
Black America I'm not even sure what
names I would put in the top three
are you
uh you know somebody says Obama but
Obama is successful because he wasn't a
black leader
like his success entirely depended on
him rejecting
the idea that he was the black president
which he did perfectly
you did that perfectly
all right
um
what about John Federman
well I hear the uh
I was going to say it's neck and neck
but that just seems so so wrong
just so wrong Larry Elder yeah there are
plenty of black leaders
that you could look to to say hey if I
want to have somebody have an opinion on
TV or something
you know you could get plenty of choices
but who who would be a black leader
that the black community looks to as a
leader sort of in some yeah no you're
saying stuff that are clearly just
conservative black people
right Thomas Sowell is awesome in a lot
of ways
but he's not a black leader
he should be like in my opinion that you
imagine how well off the black world
would be if they if they looked at
Thomas Sol as their their guide
everything would be fixed honestly
Thomas Soul If he if he were the leader
that they decided to Rally around
you're one generation away from having
everything fixed you couldn't do it in
one generation but you're one generation
away
all right
I believe we've done everything we need
to do and it's an awesome day and uh how
about you go forward and
just have that kind of oh personal
Walker what do we if you're naming
Herschel Walker as our national leader I
don't quite think so
yeah you know there are some famous
people like Denzel and Morgan Freeman
and stuff but I don't think anybody
yeah zooby
zooby's not American
foreign
I think zubi has done such a good job of
you know having a popular position in
the world people love him so much they
forget he's not even American yeah I
think I think he could get he can get a
lot of votes for president of the United
States but he's he's not American
now
zubi is the another great example of a
talent stack situation right
he's a perfect Talent stock example
there's just a whole bunch of things
that he does really well
but if you're trying to pick the one
thing you say I don't know he just does
these whole bunch of things that work
together really well and then he he
engineered them to turn it into
something awesome
yeah he's impressive in general I would
say he's an impressive person that would
be a true statement
yeah Morgan Freeman's great but he's not
really seen this
a black leader
lizzo Okay Ice Cube yeah you see the
problem don't you waiting Brady
but you see the problem
right
yeah Jason whitlock's great
but everybody you name I can say they're
great
because you know many of them are like
awesome in whatever they do but they're
not recognized as leader you know not
yay not anybody
all right George Floyd
I'll bet that's in a in a weird way
that's true George Floyd would be the
most recognizable
unifying character which is
scary
all right
that's all for now I will talk to you
tomorrow YouTube
bye
