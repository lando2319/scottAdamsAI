hey everybody
it's time for coffee with scott adams
sometimes the best part of your day and
sometimes the best part of every day
yeah and sometimes it's just the best
thing ever
it's hard to decide which it is today
but it's one of those things
for sure and all you need to guarantee
the high quality
of the day is a copper mug or a glass up
tanker jealous just like the canteen
jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine head
of the day
thing that makes everything better
except china
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
that one was extra slurpee i think you
enjoyed it
all right well the rasmussen people
uh have a new poll out very
interesting very interesting they say
that
66 so two-thirds of likely u.s voters
think congress should investigate last
year's violent protests
you know which ones i'm talking about
i'm talking about the
you know last year there were the blm
and antifa
mostly in which more than 2
000 police officers suffered injuries
did you know it was that high
2 000 police officers were injured
why is that the first time i've ever
seen that statistic
2 000 that's crazy
um 21 don't think congress should
investigate
and the number of people who want to
congress to investigate last year's
violent protest
uh as 66 percent is much higher
than the 49 who say they want to support
nancy pelosi's looking into the january
6
capital protests let's call this a riot
and 42 say they don't support looking
into january 6th
so here's a question for you
all those riots last year
did all of their complaints get fixed
is that why
uh by the way for those of you on
youtube there's a little
sign in the back that might be useful to
you
it says jesus king is the audio is fine
yes jesus king is the audio is fine
um so
that's interesting because it seems to
me that whatever was driving the protest
last year could not have been legitimate
does anybody who would disagree with
that statement that whatever was behind
the pope
the protest last year it couldn't have
been legitimate
because no problems were solved
am i right no problems were solved
so same amount of problem
but no protests interesting
interesting well i would say i would
want to look into that
if 2000 police officers were injured
in in events that are suspicious
and may be organized and maybe organized
in ways we don't understand obviously
they were organized
well in other news the milwaukee
milwaukee bucks
are the nba champions for the first time
in 50 years
uh two surprising things about that
number one um
two surprising things number one
hello youtube let's see if this works we
had a little technical
difficulty before i'm just gonna do one
topic uh
on this one it's about china and it's
based on
a unscientific poll that was done by a
china file
and they talked to 121 people who were
china connected
they were scholars and journalists and
former diplomats etc
and they asked them if they were likely
to visit china after the pandemic
restrictions are off and 40 of them
said they probably or definitely would
not
and some of them were concerned about
the safety
being jailed on trumped up charges
some of them were afraid of who knows
what
but i would say that the best way to
take down china
is by the following sentence china
is not safe for business because risk is
different in each domain
in the military risk means something
very different and you might want to
take a big risk in the military if
there's a big reward
or you just have to in your personal
life
you might take risks with your hobbies
and your extreme sports and stuff
and that's common people do that in
their personal life but in the domain of
business
people don't like risk because if you
take a risk in business
and it's a risk everybody knows is a
risk it's a well-known risk
and it doesn't go well what happens you
get fired
or you look like an idiot so once it
becomes known
or just a standard business phrase that
china is not safe for business
in a variety of ways then that should
pretty much put
china out of business it will take a
while but once other countries
realize that the risk of ip theft
the risk of imprisonment the risk of
them spying the risk of them
getting access to your communications
it's just not worth
doing business in china because these
risks are so well known
if you take a risk that that's not known
and it doesn't work out
well you know nobody's going to fire you
for that
you took a risk it didn't work out
nobody knew but if you
know that working in china
is not safe and it doesn't work out
you get fired this used to be the case
with
using ibm equipment back million years
ago when i worked in the corporate world
it would be said that if you bought
hardware from ibm
you'd never get fired because it either
works
or ibm comes in and makes it work but
it's always going to work
so you're not going to get fired because
it didn't work ibm will take care of
that
their competition well the competition
might give you a better price
but you don't know for sure it's going
to work because they're not ibm
that was the thinking back then now
things probably have changed
but once that becomes a thing
once it becomes known that something has
a risk
to it it's really chilling in the
business world
and china has gone way beyond the point
where you could say
that way beyond the point where you
could say
that it's safe so that's the point
i would just like to say one other thing
to the people complaining about the
the audio just remember
jesus king is the audio is fine
even when it's not because sometimes
it's not
but i also don't care then so there's
your tip for taking down china
and i wanted to test to see if the
reason i had technical difficulties
before
was because of the content or because of
the technology
so this will be a test of that so that's
how to destroy
china just make it a a well-known fact
that china is not safe for business
which is completely true
completely true so you don't have to lie
about anything and there you are
there's your kill shot for china in
china if you're listening
and i think you might be you really
shouldn't have killed my stepson
with fentanyl you're up there
because i'm coming for you if you don't
get me first
i'm going to take down your whole
 country so
china is not safe for business and that
is something you're going to see a lot
more of in the next month
and i will talk to you tomorrow
