about
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a better time to be
alive
there are times to be dead uh probably
probably good times to be dead but this
is the best time to be alive and that's
what I'm dealing with just that domain
right now dead people they can watch
their own entertainment that's this is
not for them this is for the living
and if you'd like to take this living
experience up to levels that could only
be reached by a Chinese spy balloon well
you're gonna need something to make that
happen What you're going to need is a
cup or a mug or a glass a tanker Chalice
of Stein the canteen joke or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous up
go
ah
has anybody noticed anything in the news
about me lately
anybody notice anything like that
I might have another sip to that
well let's begin with
oh no my enemies are sending me lots of
energy
oh no
what will I do will all of that
attention
it seems that the hate for me at the
moment has reached new levels
new levels of hate
I'm hated so much today I'm trending I'm
trending
let's drink to that trending
it's good trending
well let's talk about the news and we'll
get to uh
why I might be trending yeah I'm going
to make you wait because I know some of
you bastards came in here just to see me
get in trouble
I'm going to make you wait
[Laughter]
oh we'll talk about it we'll talk about
it but for the people who are the
regulars
I I know you'll stick around
but for those of you who are only coming
into hate on me and maybe like get
another article to write
you bastards are gonna have to wait
you're gonna have to wait through all
the other excellent entertainment to get
to that part where you can attack me
but it'll be good it's worth the wait it
is
well as I often like to tell you if I
were the author of this reality which I
believe is a simulation
I would give people funny names just so
they could figure out they were in a
simulation for example
if somebody worked as a baker I would
name them Baker
if somebody worked as a dentist
I would name them Dr Chu
that's an actual dentist by the way and
I noticed that there's an accused
murderer in the news
and what is the accused murderer
named
murdaugh
m-u-r-d-a-u-g-h
which is weird because he's accused of
murdering his wife and son and not his
daughter
it would have been a little bit more on
the nose if he'd murdered a daughter
because then he would be a murder
guy
it was close it was close very very
close yeah bankman bank man freed
yeah bank man fried
exactly
if I had somebody who did something in
the monetary domain that burned
everybody
it would be a bank man Pride or fraud
Bang been fraud that's pretty good too
all right
um saw some fake news on Fox News
um Fox News website this is in the
category of headlines that don't match
the story
now this is not of course limited to Fox
News usually I'm talking about the CNN
but everybody gets in on this once in a
while
the headline that does not match the
news and I always wonder
is the headline writer
you know just the provocative one they
sort of know what they're doing
or do they not have time to read the
article before they post it and come up
with it because it looks like maybe they
didn't read the article
it's almost like what they expected it
to be I don't know so I don't know what
the internal processing is but let me
give you the story so the headline says
this popular AI bot forced to admit
Democrats talking point doesn't add up
do you think the story supports that
headline
that the it's about chat GPT so popular
AI bot forced to admit Democrats talking
point now the topic is about climate
change but do you think that when I read
the article
I'll find out that it admits that their
talking points don't add up
no they totally add up
according to the story I don't know but
the story goes that junk science founder
that's an organization I don't know I I
guess is
it's either an organization or it's just
one guy I don't know what it is but uh
junk science founder Steve Malloy
so he published a lengthy Exchange in
which he was talking to the chat GPT and
asking it is a CO2 warming a hoax
now the AI started out by saying no it's
not a hoax it's a proven thing that CO2
raises the temperature
so far so good I would agree with that
statement that from a you know
laboratory scientific perspective pretty
much all the scientists agree that uh
worm what do they call it the greenhouse
effect
is a thing now it's not the only thing
so it doesn't mean that if the
greenhouse effect
is agreed upon that you can therefore
predict good or bad that will happen in
the future there are too many other
things happening but scientists
generally agree that that's true so so
far I think
um
that's not a problem but then it goes on
and Steve pushes it on the fact that the
theory is that the more CO2 this is my
um my own summary of it these are not
his words but the uh
since the theory is that the more CO2
you add the warmer it gets how does the
AI explain that for the past five years
it hasn't gotten warmer
while the a record amount of CO2 has
been pumped into the atmosphere
and
the chat
AI
says well you know any five-year period
I get them this is my summary
um uh not their exact words but the AI
explained that uh you know a brief
period does not uh describe climate
and it wouldn't be that apparently it
would be normal and allowed to have a
five-year period where things didn't
quite
go in lockstep in One Direction so it
could be zipping up and down but the
average over time would be up would be
the defense of that now
then I guess Steve Malloy got it to you
know admit to that more CO2 is going to
in the air at the same time that the
temperature is not going up
so do you find that in conflict
do those things seem to conflict you
so it says that any five-year period
doesn't mean anything
and then when Steve says this five-year
period is opposed to the theory
that's covered under the fact that the
theory allows that any five-year period
doesn't mean anything
and the C and the AI explained that
and then Fox News said that the AI
uh
was forced to admit Democrats talking
point doesn't add up no that never
happens that's not the story at all
right
uh come you have to see this is one of
those stories that without the the audio
or the video you just have to go see
Kamala Harris talking to some small
group about her love of Venn diagrams
now
there seems to be a pattern developing
that if there's a really really big
topic such as let's say having no border
security
uh
she's you know interested in doing the
job and talks about it
seems to take you seriously
but it's not what she loves
you can tell from a reaction that what
she loves
is charging ports on school buses
she loves that
I mean that makes her giddy but also
Venn diagrams as she was describing uh
while giggling and showing so much
excitement about overlapping circles
that I thought she was going to have an
orgasm
I don't know maybe that's just just me
but she was really really happy about it
but if you watch the video there's
something I want you to watch for in
particular
watch for her host that's sitting in the
chair up in the stage next to her and as
she goes into her Venn diagram craziness
the host just sort of is looking at her
and just sort of scratches her nose
I don't know if I'm reading her body
language right
but the body language I felt was oh God
this is embarrassing
like it feels like that's why you
scratch your nose
yeah unless her nose itched I suppose
that's possibility but if you're looking
at somebody talking and like you're
really into them are you really agreeing
you're like
yeah uh oh yeah
you sort of look like that and here's
how you look at somebody if you wish
they would stop talking because they're
embarrassing you
yeah look for it it's fun
all right
uh Rasmussen did a poll
has that ever gotten me in trouble
before
erasmussen Pole
hmm but they did a poll on Ukraine
asking people uh Americans American
voters likely voters
um
who they think is winning in Ukraine
46 say they see the war as a stalemate
uh
19 believe Russia is winning
21 think Ukraine is living basically a
tie
but these numbers have changed
um
well actually more people thought
Ukraine was winning in December so it's
actually way down from December
interesting but it's also the winter so
it's sort of a winter stalemate so I'm
not sure that that's
not tell you what you think it is I
think it's just telling you it's winter
at the moment
um
but does that does that track with what
you thought
it is roughly a tie
how many people think Russia is winning
versus Ukraine I think most people
just think it must be a stalemate
yeah
I know it tells you something about the
state of news doesn't it
that you can't even tell who's winning
the war
no it could be because
nobody knows and it's completely
mysterious
but it's a weird thing that something as
big as a war
we couldn't agree if we know who's
winning
because remember if you if you add up to
people who think Russia's winning and
the people who think Ukraine is winning
that's a lot of people
who don't have the same opinion on
whether the war is going one way or the
other
I mean that's the most basic question
who's winning the war it's strange that
we can't figure that out I realize there
are a lot of variables and war is
unpredictable by its nature but I feel
like by now
we'd have a beat on it it's kind of
weird
but yeah
war is unpredictable
um
I I saw two more videos today that uh I
think are so racist
and we keep seeing these anecdotal
videos that are not representative of
the whole
and are highly let's say brainwashing
kind of material
because every time you see a video of uh
well in this case it's video of uh black
women I think beating up a female Asian
American on a bus
now and then I saw earlier a black
student beating up a white teacher in a
school
there was just two of them I saw today
now both of them had that same flavor to
them and it's super racist
I think you'd agree with this super
racist
that the algorithm is serving me up only
black people beating up Asian Americans
and white Americans super racist because
it's it's not based on any kind of
science it's not based on any kind of uh
statistics is based on either the
algorithm or maybe some human who's
decided that you should get a an
unending diet of black Americans beating
up other people to make you feel more
racist
now since obviously the number of people
getting beaten up
is the same across all domains
there are two ways to handle this one
way would be to ban these kinds of
videos which I'd be in favor of
just ban them
ban them totally but that would be you
know sort of a First Amendment
you know kind of thing you could make an
argument based on safety and health and
stuff but
you know probably we wouldn't like that
right
would you agree
they're banning them
would be just another problem you know
that'd be a First Amendment problem
right yeah so we don't like Banning
stuff unless it like actually causes you
to go cause a crime or something
unless it's literally dangerous so the
other the other solution and this is the
one I would recommend is we need to
start releasing the videos and they must
exist of Asian Americans beating up
black people
now if you only saw that that would also
be wrong super racist
because you'd be like oh Asian Americans
why are you always beating up black
people if that's all you saw if all day
long you're saying Asian Americans
beating up
black men all day long you'd be like
damn I don't even want to live
near near these racist Asian Americans
if they're beating up black people all
day long
and that's what you would think that's
what you would think if if all you ever
saw was these videos then you would be
sort of brainwashed into thinking that a
lot of it's happening when in fact it's
just you know selective
stuff
so since I don't think we want to ban
any speech so we don't want to ban the
ones we're seeing we need to balance
this out so I need to see
for the benefit of everyone
and I think you'd agree everybody'd be
better off if we if the algorithm would
release the videos of the Asian
Americans beating up black people so at
least there's some balance now I'm not
saying I want to see anybody get beaten
up
let me clarify
I'm opposed to violence
completely I don't want to see anybody
getting beaten up
but if if it's free speech and we're
going to see right Dr Funk juice you you
agree
thank you for the support by the way
thank you for the support all the time
I always appreciate you but I don't say
it enough
um
so that would be my solution more videos
of Asian Americans beating up
black people so that we have some
balance and then we don't feel we don't
feel like we're being brainwashed by the
algorithm
all right uh did anybody notice uh that
there was a video that featured me
going around the internet yesterday and
today
yeah anybody see that I guess a Daily
Beast picked it up and
something caused picked it up and a
bunch of people
now some of it uh some of it might have
been out of context
and so some of you might be saying to
yourself
Scott
did you say something racist
and I'll I'll just
um well the answer is yes
yes
so let me start out with the answer the
question is Scott did you say something
super racist the other day yes
yes
everybody agree
let me tell you what I said I don't know
how you could interpret it any other way
all right so what I said was that based
on a Rasmussen poll
in which people uh Black Americans were
asked the question is it okay to be
white
and I noted that between the if you
added up the people who said you know no
opinion
that they they were unwilling to say
it's okay to be white and the people who
said it wasn't okay to be white it was
nearly half
and so what I said was
if there's any group
in which the data not your opinion not
your personal opinion but the data
shows that half of them have a bad
opinion about you
that you should avoid that group
completely
and people said but Scott that is so
racist
well of course it is that's exactly what
it is that's exactly the definition of
racist
now
is that a problem
what's the problem with that
is reparations racist
what about reparations
are reparations racist
yes yes reparations are racist by
definition are are reparations bad
well it depends who we ask right it's an
opinion but simply the fact that it's
completely racist
doesn't automatically make it bad
how about
[Music]
um
about uh what do you call it uh
what's why affirmative action
about affirmative action is that racist
affirmative action
yeah this race is by definition
it's racist by intention it's overtly
racist
and it's supposed to be in fact it
wouldn't work if it were not racist
would it
now I've I've tentatively been in favor
of uh
uh I'm forgetting the word but I've been
tentatively a favor of affirmative
action historically
so I've been in favor of it which is
pretty racist wouldn't you agree
would you agree that for all the years
that I was in favor of affirmative
action because I think probably there
was a point in history where you needed
a sledgehammer to get things you know
roughly equal
and it was very bad for people like me
because I lost two two careers because I
wasn't black and I wasn't female my
bosses told me that directly
if you don't know those stories you're
going to doubt that they're true trust
me they're true yeah I was told twice
that I couldn't be promoted during my
corporate years because I was white and
male
they told me that directly not not
hinted at it directly in in direct words
now during those times I was also in
favor of affirmative action
because it was also clear that
you know something needed to be done and
I didn't have a better idea so I thought
well you know I lost two careers but I
still had so many options that I went
off and got rich a different way
so I didn't feel like much of a victim
even though I was targeted
I don't really have a victim mindset so
I had plenty of opportunities so I just
said well this sucks
I'll go somewhere where things don't
suck so much so I went where you could
you know succeed just with talent I
didn't need to I didn't need to be a
certain color or gender
so when I was in favor of affirmative
action which by the way I'm currently
not in favor of
I'm currently not in favor of
affirmative action but only because the
Gap has closed enough not completely
yeah we're it's not it's not like we
have equality but we've closed the Gap
enough that the best thing you could do
for the black community would be to get
rid of favoritism
because you want to do that short of
actually full equality like you want to
end the favoritism just before you get
or or not even just before but well
before you get to Total equality because
the affirmative action causes bad
feelings on its own
right affirmative action by its nature
isn't a clean wind for black people
it's a big Advantage clearly
but it's not a clean wind because
there's a little taint you know there's
a there's always this suggestion that
well maybe you were you know one of
those kind of hires you know maybe it
wasn't totally your talent which is
completely unfair
that's something that white people don't
have to deal with
it's completely unfair
so what's fairest
for a successful let's say black people
who want to make something of themselves
and make a dent in the corporate world
and you know succeed and everything we
need to get to the point where everybody
agrees they did it on Talent
and hard work
wouldn't that be cool
that seems like the least racist place
we could be
but at the moment if you have any kind
of you know quotas or preferences it's
just purely racist so I think we've
gotten to the point in society
where racist is no longer a bad word
because we actually design things to
racism
you know both ways
yeah so
um I would agree for example that the
school systems are racist
because they're they're very much favor
people out of money because the people
with money you can go to a better school
they can go to private school Etc and
because of in my opinion systemic racism
forever black schools are inadequate
totally inadequate
so you know there there's tons
of racism happening and tons of let's
say racism that's engineered in to
correct other racism but we we have now
a thoroughly racist Society
so all yesterday people were calling me
a racist and I thought
well that's true that's exactly what I
said
it's also exactly what everybody else is
saying
I mean different topics but we're at the
point where 100 of people are racist
and it would be kind of stupid to act
like it's not true
so let me let me let me ask you this
do you think you should spend time with
a group if half of the group dislikes
you for some reason let's say half of
the group has a bad feeling about you
because of racism
that's what the Rasmus and Paul said why
would you spend time with a group half
of half of whom don't like you
why would you do that
wouldn't that be stupid
now what people said is you're being
racist and again I'm saying that's
exactly what I'm being no not even a
little bit not precisely exactly racist
because any group that half of them who
get pulled say that it's not okay to be
me I don't want to spend time with them
why would you
now some people the dumb people who want
to cause trouble
imagine that I meant
uh that all white people should stay
away from all black people in all
scenarios
how many of you are dumb enough to think
that I thought that
is there anybody who wants to admit
they're dumb enough
to think that I meant that all white
people should avoid all black people
come on you can admit it you can admit
you were dumb enough to think that's
what I said because all of our social
media people are saying it you can admit
it just admit it in public admit that
you're dumb enough to think that I meant
all white people and all black people
should act just the same
you can admit it there you go there's
somebody who's willing to admit how dumb
they are and I appreciate that that's
honest
that's honest
all right
so
let's see what else people said
um so the way it's being portrayed is of
course because the media is dishonest
the way it's being portrayed is that I
don't want to be around black people
because I don't like them
if I ever said anything like that
does that sound like anything I've ever
said
no I've actually identified as black for
years until this week
why because I like them so much I love
black people
like literally
literally love them
now that's again a bigoted statement is
it not
isn't that racist
yes yes it is I just said I love black
people which is true
and that's a racist statement
and I'm proud of it
now individuals
should always be judged as individuals
does did anybody think that I was
opposed to judging individuals as
individuals of course not
of course not
I don't know did you see uh hotep Jesus
did a video response to my video
I was just listening to it this morning
it was kind of brilliant and I love this
guy I love hotep I've been on his show
terrific guy and yeah he has some he has
some speculations about me I'll let I'll
let his speculations speak for
themselves so I won't comment on them at
the moment now he invited me on his show
and invited me to you know respond
well do you think I don't love that guy
do you think I don't love hotep Jesus I
love that guy he's terrific yeah Dr Funk
juice you think I don't love him I love
Dr Fung juice he's a regular here
yeah
so anybody who thought that it like that
it applied to individuals
well how dumb was that
I mean you have to you have to look at
yourself and say whoever said something
that applied to everybody
in any context it never applies to
everybody
and it never applies to every situation
let me here's another test to see how WR
and you can admit it if you're this dumb
did you think
that if I visited a historically black
college like I think that's where Kamala
was
that I would be afraid or would want to
run away or wouldn't like the people I
met
no no I I would trust that all of you
are smart enough
to know that you know sweeping
statements
are of course always open to lots of
exceptions
everybody should know that you're all
adults I shouldn't have to explain to
you that generalities don't apply to all
people that should be the most basic
thing you know as an adult
and I hope you do
um
I got some support from
uh Kim Creighton
I'm judging based on the profile that
Kim is a black American woman she calls
herself an anti-racist economist and her
pronouns are she and her
and what what Kim said about this
situation was quote talking about me he
cited a recent poll he said shows that
nearly half of all blacks are not okay
with white people
and then Kim goes on this is so funny to
me uh that white folks spelled f-o-l-x
folks
that's interesting our surprise because
blacks are not okay with white people
given history and today why shouldn't we
be
exactly
exactly
I I agree
so here's a black woman who's agreeing
that I should feel uncomfortable around
populations of black people because some
large group of them
would have a reasonable
historically based bad opinion of me
now this was my point
right my point is that some large
percentage and I'm not sure that the
Rasmussen poll had exactly the right
percentage one of the things that hotep
Jesus pointed out correctly is that the
nature of the question was so open to
interpretation that you don't really
know where where that you know would
have fallen out if they'd asked the
question differently
but whether or not nearly half of all
black people have the opinion or
if it's only 25 percent is still way too
much way too much
would you would you hang around in a
group where 25 of them
had a bad feeling about you
I recommend getting away from any group
where 25 percent of them have a bad
feeling about you that's just not a safe
place to be
um
and it doesn't matter who you are or
what ethnicity you are Etc like if
you're if you were a black uh let's say
you're a young black person
and you had a chance to hang around with
a bunch of white supremacists
it's probably a bad idea I'd say run
away
let's say run away now let's say that
they're not always supremacists but
let's say they're not condemning them
you know what I mean
they're not white supremacists per se
but let's say there's a group of people
who refuses to condemn them for whatever
reason
if you were black would you hang around
with that group of people
I wouldn't
[Laughter]
and I I would recommend that you don't
either all right now there's a second
part of this so-called controversy that
isn't really a controversy the reason
this is not a controversy is that nobody
disagrees with me
by the way you've caught that right
nobody disagrees with me
some people have misinterpreted that so
they'd have something to you know jabber
about but nobody disagrees with any of
my points black or white
right that the the uh the temperature of
the comp the country has gotten so bad
that it's actually dangerous to to mix
across
um ethnicities in some cases not every
case but there are some cases where the
temperature is just so high that I would
just stay away
I say that looks a little dangerous to
me
so
the other the second thing is
um I said separately but then I think
I've combined them so these are two
things that got kind of conflated that
things are so bad in the Black American
communities
in my opinion because of systemic racism
so the you know economics are bad that's
always a breeding ground for Crime crime
is high there's a lot of racial hatred
Etc and so as a proxy
just as a like a flag or an indicator
you don't want to go where there's a
high percentage of urban black
population
and you should run away from that as
fast as you can but here's the part I
think I think was missing from my
analysis
you should do that if you're black
you get that right
let's say uh you're a single mom I'll
just you know paint a picture here it
doesn't have to be a single mom that's a
single mom away because that that's a
distraction let's say you are black
parents
and you've got a kid who's got you think
has some potential you're like I think
my kid can get out of this place
what would be the best thing for you to
do as black parents to support your
black son or daughter
move yeah and where would you move to
well unfortunately because of years of
systemic racism finding a mostly black
neighborhood that would be really
focused on education and advancement and
low crime
it would be hard to find
now I don't know that there are none
yeah there might be but the the
correlation is so strong
because of systemic racism for years in
my opinion that's why that you could
actually use it as a decision-making
gauge and that all white people do they
just don't talk about it all Asian
Americans do they just don't talk about
it and all black people do they just
don't talk about it yeah
um I'm going to tell you something that
happened to me yesterday to make my
point
um I got a phone call from somebody I
worked with professionally
who is very disturbed
about my statements
because he was married to a black woman
and she was very disturbed about it and
she said that they lived in an upscale
white neighborhood
and she was concerned that my attitude
might you know catch on and she would be
ostracized in her white neighborhood
have you ever met anybody who had
ostracize a black woman in a high-end
neighborhood
like I don't think that's ever happened
like maybe in the history of the entire
world
not a woman and not in a high-end
upscale neighborhood
so I have great empathy and I'm sorry
that her feelings were hurt
but she doesn't have any risk you know
let me explain how white people work
if you're if you're a
black woman
living in a high-end white neighborhood
you were completely accepted
completely
that's my experience
like I I can speak from my own
neighborhood right
so you know there's like literally zero
any kind of
um discrimination that you could find
anywhere it just doesn't exist in my
neighborhood and I think that's not that
uncommon
but here's here's the punch line
they were complaining about my point of
view that you should get away from uh
black people I remember that was in
context if you hear it out in a context
it sounds completely different
but they had done the same thing
they had moved away from black people
to live with white people
that was my point
so the very thing that they did to
organize their life was exactly what I
recommend it wouldn't matter if you're
white or black
you should get away from concentrations
of inner city you know terrible schools
and whatever culture is not working now
I don't know why it's not working I
think systemic racism is you know the
base reason
then here's the other thing that is uh
why the response to me is not as big as
you might expect
did you think it would be more pushed
back to what I said I mean there's a lot
but then you think there'd be more
do you know what they don't want to hear
they is all white people you know I'm
not talking about black people you know
what all white people don't want to hear
everybody who ever succeeded did it the
same way
that that's like that's the most
dangerous message in America
everyone who ever succeeded did it the
same way
five things you got to get right
number one
stay in a jail
number two
don't be addicted to alcohol or drugs
number three don't start a family too
young before you're ready
right and if you do stay married
number four make education or training
you know any any form of learning your
top priority through life
number five
show some character
and that would include everything from
showing up on time to you know being a
good person Etc a hundred percent of the
people yeah I won't say 100 but
everybody who succeeded
pretty much did it that way
now which part of that is unavailable to
Black America
none of it it's all available
it's all available right and we are we
are treating black Americans like
infants
to imagine they're the only group who
can't do the most obvious thing that
everybody knows how to do everybody
and it's the only group that can't do it
that's pretty racist isn't it
to imagine that there's only one group
that can't use the same formula that
everybody uses they're the only groups
that can't use that simple easy formula
that is super racist is it not
I mean almost our entire structure is
built around black inferiority which is
not demonstrated by anything I'm aware
of
right because I know somebody's going to
say oh it's IQ it's IQ but that doesn't
explain any of this
it doesn't it just doesn't
because black Americans do great when
they have you know good situations they
do great everybody does basically every
everybody does great if they follow the
five rules
now not everybody's going to be you know
uh doing rocket science see the thing
that white racists get wrong all the
time and I have to explain this to you
again I feel like I explained this all
the time
among men in particular there's such
variants in IQ
that you know if there are a bunch of
people at the top or a bunch of people
at the bottom excuse the average
so there are a whole bunch of white
people
who are super super smart and like
inventing
technology and stuff but I'm not one of
them
I'm not one of them chances are you're
not either
so to lump me in with these Geniuses
that are not me
like how does that make sense
like how do you take these you know
freaks of nature who are super smart and
then average them with you and me
and then think you have something oh
I've got something that's useful because
I average people who are completely
different
it would make sense to compare compare
IQ of any two groups if all of their IQs
were the same within the group
well then you'd have something
but otherwise all you're doing is
averaging things that don't make sense
to be averaged
right
it just doesn't make sense
because everybody gets treated as an
individual ultimately so you know that
the IQ thing whether it's true or not
true it doesn't have it doesn't
translate into real world action and it
just doesn't work in the real world so
it wouldn't matter if it were true and
it doesn't matter how smart white people
are on average if you're not one of them
right it doesn't matter how smart I am
it does not accrue to any other white
people if I'm very successful
no other white people get to take credit
for that
that's just me
if you know if Michael Jordan is
successful that doesn't mean all black
people can play in the NBA
right you can't you can't average
Michael Jordan
with everybody who plays basketball and
say that that gave you something useful
it didn't that's not useful
anyway so if you learn to stop averaging
things that don't make sense being
averaged together and compared just
just know that it doesn't make sense
yeah so everybody has the same path out
and it usually takes one generation
um the Black America could be back on
path
if schools could be fixed so right now
Black America is completely handicapped
by a system which is broken and and the
school
the teachers unions in particular I
would point out as the main source of
systemic racism
the main source
all right
um
let me ask you this
uh how many how many black viewers do I
have is anybody is anybody black besides
doctor
Funk juice
a few all right so let me see if I can
ask this question
um
and
I'm only going to ask you if you're
black okay
so if you are black if you identify as
black let's say say you know black colon
and then give me the answer so so I know
that it's not the white people jumping
in here because you know the white
people ruin everything
so white people don't ruin this poll
now here's the question
um if you're black
and you knew that let's say there was a
poll that said white people
half of them would not agree with the
idea that black lives matter
now not just because they want to add in
all lives matter and be political about
it but what if the way it was asked was
you really
half of them said they don't matter
would you want to spend time with that
group
what would be your best strategy for
dealing with that group of people if you
knew that half of them roughly were not
okay with black lives mattering would
you want to spend time with them
black people
I'm only looking for black answers right
now which is racist can you agree
pretty racist right favorite in Black
opinions
but everything's racist
black and no Dr funchu says yes
no
uh and Dr functions I believe you
and I believe the others as well
um
I'm black and you all sound racist but I
don't blame you see now that's
that that is such a high awareness
opinion
did I don't know if you caught that so a
black viewer just said I'm black you're
you all sound racist but I don't blame
you
that's like the perfect summary isn't it
that's exactly what I'm saying yeah we
we should stop separating things by
racists and not racist because it is all
racist
it's all racist from top to bottom I
mean it's Turtles all the way down
uh Christian Watson says you
uncritically accepted the Rasmussen poll
without any further investigation
well I wouldn't say uncritically but
your your comment is valid it's the same
one
oh it's up Jesus mate
so can we agree
that if the if the poll had been lit
completely invalid and let's say the
number of black Americans who would say
such a thing would be like five percent
you know sort of trivial
would I change my opinion or should I
or should I
and I would think yes that would that
would influence me because remember it's
a data-driven opinion
so if the data is wrong
but I will point to Kim Creighton's who
is a black woman whose opinion was that
uh black people should have I mean it's
normal and nobody should be surprised
that black people are not okay with
white people
and I would say that the rasman Paul
Rasmussen poll
is consistent with but this is not a
science consistent with anecdotally
um the fact that the the media is
anti-white
so if you have a Non-Stop education and
media system which is consistently
anti-white
which I think everybody would agree with
would would the would the black viewers
agree with that statement
that the media is skewing anti-white
or is that just an impression
uh implicit bias if you have a breed you
have a bias yeah yeah there's no such
thing as not having a bias and I think I
think we
we treat ourselves like children
when we act like some of us are unbiased
that's kind of dumb isn't it
right so this is why I so agree with Kim
Creighton who said you know based on
history based on you know
what uh Society has put forth as
information
she says that black people should have a
bad opinion of white people
that's what I was saying
now uh so to your point about the
responsible I accept that the nature of
the question
was vague enough that people could have
answered it with other con with other
understanding of the question for
example this is hotep Jesus's point one
of the ways you could interpret that was
because of the Media Nature have they
made it seem like it's not okay to be
white which might not be your own
opinion
right so some people could have answered
it not as their own opinion but rather
they could be answering it as has
Society decided it's not okay to be
white and might actually be answering in
a way that was I would consider it
positive
in other words if you were black and you
answered that question but while you
were thinking internally was well I like
black I like white people
but you know the society is sort of
treating them like it's not okay to be
white so I'm going to say it's not okay
to be white because I'm answering like
for society I'm not talking about my own
now I do know what it means to be of a
low IQ I do know what that means
I think you're missing my point though
everybody knows what that means have you
noticed that when people disagree with
me
they usually assign an opinion to me
that's ridiculous before disagreeing
so here's somebody who's saying that I
don't understand what it's like to have
a low IQ
I'm pretty sure everybody understands
that
no did I say that if you had an IQ of 80
you could become a scientist did you
imagine that I thought that if only you
had all the opportunities and went to a
good school your your IQ of 80 would be
fine you could be a doctor is that what
you imagined about my opinion
so do you see the consistency I'm
assigned ridiculous opinions because my
actual opinions you agree with
right my actual opinions you completely
agree with that's what's dangerous about
this isn't it what's dangerous is not
that you disagree
the reason I'm trending is because of
how many people agreed
not because of how many disagreed
all right
um
so that's that
I'm switching my endorsement from Trump
to um
to Vivek ramaswamy because as I've been
telling you for a while I'm a one-issue
voter
and while Trump has said clearly that he
would attack the cartels
for fentanyl Vivek is making a much
bigger emphasis on it
so I'm going to go with the the bigger
emphasis but I also like the fact that
he's not white
because that would just help
because it because it's going to turn
everything turns racist right so if if
uh White old Trump is attacking Mexico
people are going to call me a racist
you get that right
if Trump were president and I supported
him because of fentanyls specifically
and then he attacked Mexico it would be
this white guy attacking Brown Mexicans
and I support him therefore I'm a racist
am I right
but if Vivek
ramaswamy if he's president and he
attacks Mexico that all goes away
so from my personal selfish interest I'd
rather have a brown president attacking
a brown country
it's a better look and he seems pretty
serious about it
so I like that
oh Vive I'm pronouncing his name wrong
really
is Vivek
how did you let me go this far with it
without correcting me until now you
probably did and I didn't see it is that
correct it's Vivek not Vivek
I've been saying it wrong the whole time
I'm not sure you're right
I guess I'll have to go listen to it
vivec no
he's probably used to it being
pronounced anyway
if you had a name that people couldn't
pronounce wouldn't you just sort of get
over it after a while and just give up
you know okay whatever I'll be whatever
you want me to be
all right well uh
Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to the 16
years in prison today guilty on three
counts of sexual assault and here's the
strangest part of this story
oh somebody saying the vivec is correct
well we'll find out
um
the strangest thing about this Harvey
Weinstein being sentenced to prison is I
thought this happened a long time ago
was he only a waiting trial
or was he already convicted and then
they just added some new new stuff
oh multiple trials so he was already in
jail right didn't make any difference
we're just adding some to it
all right
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
um is my prepared presentation
I will now entertain your questions
does anybody have any questions by the
way
how many of you came here to uh
watch me get canceled
and we're surprised
are you a racist Scott I I accept that
everybody's a racist
I think it's ridiculous to act like some
some people don't think in racial terms
people think in different racial terms
but we're you know the the news has
programmed us all to be racist so I
think you should just all embrace it at
this point yeah racism is like
multimedia
are you old enough to remember when new
computers there were usually you know
PCS window well pre-windows when they
first were able to do video and sound
they were sold as multimedia computers
but now we don't say it's a multimedia
computer because every computer is
multimedia
and it's like the racist stuff
if you're calling one person a racist
it's sort of like
you know slicing it a little too little
everybody's a racist at this point
because everybody thinks in racial in
racial terms if you treated everybody as
an individual
then you would not be a racist
but if you ever talk about Black
Americans or you ever talk about white
Americans as a group you are a racist
as soon as you talk about them as a
group you are a racist
that's what it is by definition
if you could ignore that and treat
everybody as an individual
well then you would not be
but we live in the system in which
you're forced to think in those terms
because that's how stuff is coming at
you you have to at least deal with
what's coming at you
and affirmative action is something that
comes at you right that it's not your
fault it just came at you
Snickers is doing great
she's old and tired but
she's much better to use as a pillow
when I try to get to sleep
that if I wake up at 2 30 in the morning
as I always do and I have to decide
whether to get up for the day or not if
I don't want to get up for the day I'll
go get Snickers and she's always sleepy
at night so she doesn't move around too
much and I'll take her to my bed and
I'll use her as a pillow not on top of
her like on the side
and uh
her her calmness
puts me to sleep
because she's sort of warm and fuzzy and
she's happy because she's sleeping and I
just like I I pick up her vibe
so I'm kind of using the effect where
every once while if I you know drop
something on my foot at home I'll if I
yell the dog will be so upset
that I'm upset that she has to like go
hide in the backyard
so she's so connected to me emotionally
that when I get upset she gets upset if
I'm happy she's happy so basically my
mood affects her mood completely but it
works the other way as well
so when she's so sleepy that she just
wants to like snore
I just put her up to my ear
and just relax and I can actually feel
her
like emotional
state of relaxation and it just goes
right through me it's so it's so
immediate and then I just fall asleep
yeah so one of the most useful things
you could ever learn about how humans
are wired is that we're wired
bi-directionally
that you know I affect my dog's feelings
but of course she affects mine uh if
you're happy you smile but if you smile
more you become happy if you're
successful you feel whole
but if you're whole you can make
yourself feel successful like everything
works bi-directionally as soon as you
learn that everything's everything works
out better
all right uh so what do you think am I
going to get canceled
canceled
see here's what's interesting about this
situation
uh anybody who knows my actual opinion
yeah the full opinion that you're
hearing right now anybody who is my
actual opinion doesn't want to give him
more attention
so it's going to be sort of a
sort of a dicey situation if they cancel
me because you don't want to give me
more attention
that's not going to work for whatever
whatever you're trying to achieve
but I like it
is it hard for you to believe that I
woke up in a good mood and I thought
well today's going to be fun
yeah poking the bear so uh hotep Jesus's
uh
um take is that I'm trolling
what do you think
yes or no is this a giant troll
I'm just looking at your answers I'm
saying yeses and no's more no's on
locals
I'm saying both I'm saying yes
well let me ask you this question
what's the difference
what's the difference
laughs
tell us what need is I don't know what
that is
are you ever not trolling well I'll tell
you the way I I think of it
I think of it more as being provocative
which draws which draws energy toward
the point
now if you want to call that trolling
because it gets people all excited and
you know they'll take it out of context
and you know they'll look stupid
well yeah it's that too
it's definitely that too
did I know that it would surface people
acting racist and stupid of course I did
did I think that would be fun yeah yeah
I did I thought that would be fun
you grifted after oh let me finish my
point so about the Rasmussen Bolt
um first of all uh Rasmussen does have a
good reputation
uh you should research that but I think
there are presidential polls are among
the top you know they're in the top I
don't know top quarter or so of Poland
and I don't think that anybody's uh had
a super big problem with their
methodology
so I mean compared to polling in general
because all the pollsters are having
some trouble getting people to to be
honest uh but here's my take
suppose it was off by
I don't know 100 percent
it doesn't matter if it's off by 100 my
point would be the same if 25 of the
group
you know has a bad feeling about you I'd
feel uncomfortable around that group
as you should as any normal person would
so it wouldn't matter if it's way off
it's it's so striking that it could be
half that degree and it would still mean
the same thing
yeah and even if people were uh
answering that you know not for
themselves that they're answering for
the system if the system says that I
still it's still kind of the same
Scott Wilson fell for the 4chan uh hoax
about me
did you also fall fall for my uh husband
apology
you got double hoaxed A lot of people
got double hoaxed on that
but they don't know it yet so it's funny
lend you a million you don't have to say
that too many times
I think I'm going to make you go away
because you're just saying the same
comment over and over
you are now hidden on this channel
for being repetitive
all right
um
Scott don't hide this comment
all right
I will hide that comment
all right the whole user
yes I am mocking all Races but I'm also
saying that everybody is one
where would you go to the mountains
no
no the the idea is not to avoid all
individuals
so I think some people also assumed
that I meant avoid all individuals
now oh I would never say that
all individuals should be treated as
fully respected humans
with no exceptions
so of course I'm going to be you know
just the same as I am in person to
everybody like that doesn't change
uh
the difference between racist and biased
I don't know I don't know if that's a
useful distinction or not is it
book update oh I've got to do some more
edits in the next couple weeks and then
I'll then most of my work will be done
for my book
all right
uh yeah I didn't get a blizzard in
Northern California it's just raining
all right well I was really expecting a
lot more uh
action this morning
but it turns out that when I tell you my
actual opinion nobody has a problem with
it
let me ask does anybody have a problem
with my actual opinion as it was
described this morning
anybody
no
but your eyes there's going to be a
there's going to be a whole other world
that didn't hear the full context
and everybody who didn't fear the full
context will will use me as a political
football
so
now how much of this do you think is
just trying to cancel me for being a uh
presumed Trump supporter
how much do you think that the Daily
Beast would have run the article about
me except that it hurts Trump
yeah I think it's just a way to hurt
Trump
I think that's their price and getting
clicks that's about all they care about
anyway but if you see something in The
Daily Beast that looks like my God how
could anybody have that opinion it's
probably because they don't
or you haven't heard the context
you're going back on your word about
Trump no I'm not
no I've always said that uh all of my
endorsements for this this time around
any endorsement I make is going to be on
one topic and that I'll change it in a
heartbeat
to the next person who has a better take
on so so vivex uh current endorsement is
temporary if somebody has a stronger
take or even just a better take
then I would I will switch my allegiance
immediately I don't have any Allegiance
this time I'm a single topic voter
all right
um
so I guess that's it for this and I will
go do some other stuff I'm going to talk
to the locals people separately thanks
for joining YouTube
uh I know you wanted more of a fight on
this but yeah
bye for now
