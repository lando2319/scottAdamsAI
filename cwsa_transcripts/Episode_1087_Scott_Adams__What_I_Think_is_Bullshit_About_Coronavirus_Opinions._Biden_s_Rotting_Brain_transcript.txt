[Music]
hey everybody
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
is it gonna be a good one no
it's gonna be a great one so great
that you'll be wondering why i held back
until now
yes that's how good it will be just like
every morning the
simultaneous sip is the highlight of the
day
and all you need to enjoy it
i think you know but just in case
someone is new
you need a copper mug or a glass of
tanker chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip but it
happens now go
i feel the herd immunity level
dropping yes we'll have herd immunity
probably at one percent now
if you all did the simultaneous sip if
some of you decided not to do the
simultaneous step by well i make no
promises
see that's my out all right let's talk
about the news
uh chicago is falling apart it's being
looted
and i still don't care
i'd love to i want to care but i don't
feel like i should care about people
more than they care about themselves
so i'd say that black lives matter is
completely discredited
which is sad because it was only
a month or so ago that they were riding
high and looking very
credible in their claims but time goes
by
and now black lives matter has morphed
from
a sincere concern by most people who are
marching
into some kind of a marxist
looting opportunity based on
 so um
i feel sorry for the people who are
trying to make a difference
because if you've associated with black
lives matter the organization
not not the idea but just the
organization
you have chosen a bad horse to ride
so the highlight films from the looting
in chicago
the big game big game in chicago were
fun to watch and that was all i cared
about it
i just can't care about chicago more
than chicago
cares about itself i don't think it
works that way
if they really really cared about
themselves
well they might act differently and then
i would see what i could do to help
the fake news story of the day is that
president trump was trying to figure out
how to get his face on mount rushmore
now when i say fake news
you know we live in a world where
nothing's quite as clean as it could be
is it possible that
uh the president had once once mentioned
to the governor of north dakota
south dakota whichever dakota um
that uh all the dakotas are alike
i mean do you really need an earth in
the south it's a little bit overkill
how about just one dakota
we don't need two
but anyway does it is it possible that
the president ever asked about
what it would take to get on there yeah
it's possible
totally possible but how serious would
he have been
maybe you look into it now the the thing
that i like
most about president trump other than
he's just
damn entertaining all the time is that
he doesn't seem to have any limits on
what he thinks
is possible to a large degree
that's what makes him successful he has
that anything can happen
i can be president i can build a
building
i can become a billionaire even if i've
lost all my money
so he has this sort of indomitable why
not
attitude so if you take the person who
you know won the presidency against all
odds
did some you know amazing
accomplishments in my opinion
even already would he would that
personality
at least at least ask the question
i'm just asking hypothetically
what would it take for a president who
did a really good job you know just for
example
do get an extra head up on there what
would it take
is it possible that president trump ever
asked that question
i hope so i really do
i hope he did because that's the guy i
like
as my president i like the guy who might
say
i'm not saying it's likely but let's
just feel it out a little bit
if if you can tell me that you genuinely
don't
appreciate that that that's you know
that that's who he is
i don't know i think you're missing the
best part of him
is that he literally thinks there's
nothing there's nothing out of bounds
in terms of you know possibilities in
terms of
good things specifically um is it
possible that a
staffer once contacted somebody to ask
what the process is
could be i mean it's as likely fake news
is not
right whenever the anonymous person did
something
so when the president says it's fake
news that's probably true
that's probably true it's probably fake
news but
things are not always yes or no is it
possible that a
rogue staffer could have asked about the
process
here's why that makes sense if i were
uh let's say on the campaign staff or
just the staff at the white house
wouldn't you kind of know if what do you
want to know if there's a process
because if there is a process how
hilarious would it be to start it going
you see where i'm going so cnn reports
it like
it's a case of trying to get on there
maybe who knows more likely you just ask
the question
because hey you never know but if a
staffer
contacted to ask what the process is
the calculation you should do in your
head is
how would it look if he was already in
the process
and obviously you could get enough
republicans to
to vote for it to sign a poll do a
petition
fill out some paperwork so if there is a
process
wouldn't it be funny if he were in the
process
even if he didn't think it would
necessarily culminate with him being on
there
it would just be sort of delightful
it would be sort of like being nominated
for the nobel prize
you know this is better than better than
nothing right it doesn't mean you're
going to get it
but it would be kind of hilarious to
have that process going
so could a staffer have done that as
sort of a strategic thing because it
would look good
and it would be funny maybe maybe
but i think fake news has got to be your
your first go-to on
likelihood now
there's a i i could give you a uh
sneak peek of some information that's
going to come out
in a few hours so rasmussen will be
reporting
this morning uh but i have not yet i
i got permission to to tell you this in
advance
but uh they're going to show the
rasmussen poll
that 59 think biden is unlikely to
finish a four-year term in the white
house
59 think he won't finish
a four-year term
now uh as you know cnn has quite
hilariously
decided that and i think the washington
post and some other anti-trump
outlets have hilariously decided that
their
defense of joe biden will be the
the monty python defense if you don't
know the monty python defense
i'm not going to do a monty python
scheme
or sketch because it's been done to
death
i will however bring in dale
to give his full-throated defense
of why it is that joe biden is clearly
clearly mentally competent uh dale
could you come over here we've got some
questions about
president biden what's the question well
the question is
why do you think he's mentally competent
because we're all watching
him talk and it's not looking good
but you're pretty sure he's mentally
competent dale can you come over here
and explain this
sure it's obvious
have you seen the man ride a bike
proof i don't want to get all science on
you because i know you're a denier
but when you see the science of the
bicycle riding
i think that's pretty pretty much
puts the lid on those rumors about joe
biden's
competence and moreover
i think you'd agree he didn't just he
didn't just ride it in a straight line
he took corners and he took a well
he took corners on that bicycle like
i i don't know like you you know a 25
year old man could barely make a corner
like that
it was almost 45 degrees he took it with
no
trouble at all and you know
that you can't have a mental and
confidence and a ride of bicycles
what what okay i'm being told
that you could totally ride a bicycle if
you were mentally incompetent
but that's not what's happening you can
tell by the way
he is riding it the style of his writing
the capability the confidence the
corners
the way he turns that just
speaks mental competence i think pretty
clearly
and seen so
the hilarity of if if you didn't see uh
brian stelter's uh defense and now
there's another there's a
hilarious uh blog post on
cnn saying that that biden has just
driven a stake
through the argument that he is mentally
incompetent
you know before that bicycle riding
thing
yeah you can see why people might be
saying it but now that he rode a bicycle
for i don't know 50 50 yards
now that we've seen that well case
closed
case closed
no no he's not dead he's just resting
in fact cnn went so far as to say that
president trump's attack on biden for
being
sleepy has now been completely
discredited
because he rode a bike for 50 yards
and they said that with like a straight
face
if you could have a straight face while
you're writing something if you know
what i mean
they sold that as a serious commentator
common
commentary so that was pretty amusing
uh the simulation continues to amuse
just as we're wondering if
kamala harris is going to be the
vice president choice or if that choice
is dead
there was somebody with the same name
kamal harris who
apparently is a professional wrestler
who tragically died yesterday
that's right somebody named kamala
harris died yesterday
at the same time we're wondering if her
political career is alive or dead
yeah in the sense of the vice president
pick now
there's some speculation that if she's
not chosen as the vice president pick
that uh maybe
she's they're holding her out for the
presidential spot now people ask me
scott scott scott
it doesn't make sense that they would
pick somebody else for a vice president
because that person would be the obvious
person to become
the top candidate if joe biden dropped
down so it doesn't make sense
that they would you know put in somebody
else at the top
when the whole point of a vice
presidential pick is that they're ready
now
to take the top spot so you'd have to
ask yourself why
you know if somebody else is the top
spot
why did you pick this vice president in
the first place and
the answer is what if they
already know they're going to get rid of
the top spot
before election day what if they know
they want to replace the top
and put in the vice presidential pick at
maybe the same time
what would that look like well what that
would look like is you would absolutely
have to pick somebody for the top spot
who had been recently running for
president i think you would be limited
to that
because the public would just sort of
insist that somebody who put in the work
you know is considered so that would be
you know your elizabeth warrens your
um kable harris's your cory bookers etc
but kamala is probably the strongest of
that
group if you ask me
and if she doesn't get picked
or let's say the longer you go
every day that we go without a vp pick
suggests that they're looking to change
out both candidates
so that doesn't mean it's true but it's
very suggestive
of the fact that there's a bigger
decision than just the vp
now if today they announce the vp and
it's
you know bass then i think there you
have other problems
in terms of the the kamala harris theory
and would it be possible that you can
make the change
after biden had picked some other vice
president
and the answer is yeah you could work
with me on this
let's look just think this through let's
say you bind and picked uh
karen bass for vice president
you might say to yourself well you know
not really
tested and at the highest level
you kind of want a governor or a senator
or something wait what is karen bess a
representative
um so you might say yourself okay that's
as good as
you know a vice presidential pick needs
to be
now the whole point of a vice president
pick is that they need to look
less good than the top of the ticket
if you don't get that right it's a bad
look you don't want your vice president
pick
to be clearly a better candidate than
the top of the ticket
so what happens if biden drops out
before election day and bass is the vice
presidential pick
do you feel her as the top of the ticket
i don't because i feel like she hasn't
been quite tested enough
but you could easily see kamal harris at
the top of the ticket
so i do think that in this weird case of
replacing a candidate before the
election if it happens
it does open the possibility that kamala
could be slotted into the top slot
without ever having been picked as the
vice president
completely possible in my opinion but
um every day that goes by people are
saying i don't think
it's kamala maybe like uh
willie brown said recently she'd be a
better attorney general to which i say
strong argument strong argument she
could be
uh she would probably be uh
you know a strong pick for attorney
general so maybe
we'll see um
let's see what else is going on
um i think we got to talk about
coronavirus
but before we do that let's talk about
sports i did a tweet in which i asked
people
if they've lost interest in any
professional sports
that they used to be interested in and
man did people lose interest
people lost a lot of interest
and i don't know if it's just because
the way they're doing it without the
crowds because it's a late season
so it doesn't look like it really counts
in the usual way
or if people just got out of the habit
and here's the thing i'd like to inject
into the conversation if you're looking
at what is the future of sports
i would suggest that breaking people
from their habit
of every sunday i sit down and i watch
my sports or
every evening i watch a basketball game
in the fall
whatever your habit was your habit
probably got broken
and when a habit gets broken it's hard
to
hard to get it back because you just
can't beat habit for locking in a
product
it's one of the reasons that comic
strips can last for
30 years in the newspaper whereas a tv
show
typically can't etc and it's because
people are very
habit driven for their newspaper habits
which is why newspapers can even still
be a thing
years after you think people should be
watching on their devices
so habit is incredibly strong and the
coronavirus broke it
it broke the habit so once that habit is
broken
i don't know that sports can ever
recover back to where they were
you know i'm sure it'll be a viable
business but i don't think it's getting
back to where it was
all right let me talk about the
coronavirus
oh yeah one more thing i
so the president did his executive
orders which
uh he can't create money that doesn't
exist
you need congress to do that in terms of
creating a budget
but he can move things around and he can
delay things and he's using
he's using that power for the
coronavirus relief
stuff now here's my question
or maybe it's a statement doesn't
congress seem like the wrong place
for budget authority in an emergency
now congress is exactly the right place
for budget authority
in normal times even as dysfunctional as
they are
it's still the right place you still
need it to be there but in the very
specific case of a national emergency
should that affects the economy as well
as the well-being of the people
i'm feeling like that's a
commander-in-chief job
my perfect situation would be the
commander-in-chief
in an emergency could just simply
allocate funds as
as if it were congress and
you'd have to constrain that so it
doesn't get out of control it has to be
an emergency maybe
maybe congress needs to say it's an
emergency i don't know
and then then i would also suggest that
if you have that system
and you just say you know our our
homeland defense is inseparable from our
economic health
they're inseparable so the only way to
protect the country is to
protect the economy the only way to do
that right is also by protecting the
people
the health etc and therefore
since the economy and the p the public
health
and homeland security are really all
just one big ball
in the specific case of an emergency i'd
rather have the commander-in-chief have
complete control of the budget with this
control that the supreme court
could line veto anything
that doesn't meet the test of being
applicable to the emergency
so in other words if your president
tried to push through
i don't know border wall funding just
because
the commander-in-chief has all the power
now it's an emergency i'll use the
emergency to get this
other stuff and he makes a case and goes
well you need border security
because then you know people don't get
in with the virus
and then the supreme court looks at it
and say yeah i hear what you're saying
but you only have authority for
immediate stuff
so the border wall is out but the bill
can continue
so nothing gets delayed the supreme
court would look at it
24 hours and say no not this one
you know the the payments to the people
that's good the delay of this
you can do that but you can't build a
wall you know that that's not what this
emergency stuff is about
um would that be a better system i'll
just put that out there
because i don't know that when the
constitution was created
this sort of situation was really
contemplated
because in those days you just have more
time for everything
uh so that's the tweak i would make put
it make it the commander-in-chief's job
under the emergency situation with
the supreme court as kind of a check all
right
um because you know depending on
congress for money in an emergency
it's just not a thing it's just not a
thing
all right i i've
come to some new revised opinions on the
coronavirus
and let's go through that the hydroxyl
chloroquine estimate i have been
at 50 chance that
it's real and it works if you
if you combine it with the zinc and
azithromycin and you give it to people
early
when they first have symptoms so i've
said based on what i've seen
sort of a coin flip sort of a 50 50. you
just can't tell
and i've revised that down to 30
and i'll tell you why so still might
work if it's a 30
chance of working i'd still want to get
the prescription
just in case because the downside is so
low
and the upside is really high um
so it doesn't change whether you should
get a prescription but let me tell you
why i've
lowered my estimate i've been saying
since the beginning that
we don't have the good you know the rpt
you know what he called the placebo
placebo-controlled randomized
study the the gold standard study so we
don't have that kind of study
for the appropriate use of the drug
which is early and with the zinc
we have studies that show without the
zinc they're worthless
we have studies that show it when you
use it at the wrong time when it's too
late
they're worthless so there are lots of
high quality studies of the wrong stuff
so we've got good studies of the wrong
stuff
worthless we have i think
the number was 56 or more studies if you
will but not the
rpt gold standard studies that suggest
it works
and it's been asked what are the chances
that you'd have all
these studies that sure they're not gold
standard but they're different ways of
looking at it
and they all point the same direction
it's a pretty good point
but it's not evidence
it just doesn't rule it out that you
know
so i wouldn't put too much weight on
that because first of all
if somebody had a study that was
different wouldn't we have ever seen it
i don't know so there's lots there's
lots to be
asked about that and then what i thought
was going to be the most
persuasive was comparing countries that
used hydroxychloroquine
to countries that didn't how many of you
have seen
the chart that shows that the country is
not using hydroxychloroquine or like
their curve is way high
lots of death lots of infection compared
to the ones who used it early and it's
like
nothing it's like it just wiped out the
virus
practically how many of you have seen
that
chart i think laura ingram added on the
show
i've tweeted it a bunch of times you've
all seen it right
so um and dr zelenko had
tweeted it himself so i tweeted his
tweet that included that chart and study
and i
asked the smart people on the internet
to say does this look right
and what do you think they said not even
close
yeah i think gummy bear has run that
chart as well
and when you open it up to people who
are sort of good at finding problems
with things
which is most of my followers it just
doesn't hold up at all
so here's what's obviously wrong about
it
it leaves countries out now if you say
to yourself
yeah but so what if you left some
countries out
the ones that are in tell the whole
story
if it's true that these countries used
it early and they got this result
and it's true that these countries
didn't use it and they got a
wildly different result does it really
matter
that you left out other countries
because that's enough right
no that's how you fake it the way you
create
a fake chart is by leaving out the other
countries that don't show the pattern
now let me ask you this does every
country
have a chart that goes up and then
there's some point where it goes down
you all agree that every country has one
of those charts right
they don't all use hydroxychloroquine
some of them
just go and the united states has sort
of that double dip thing
but they all have a point where there's
an inflection
now the inflections are all compressed
in
let's say just a month or so right
there's like maybe two months but it was
something like one month
where every country that had an
inflection point it was so it was around
about that
same time how many of them also
made some kind of a change with their
hydroxychloroquine
that just coincidentally lines up with
when that was going to happen anyway
doesn't take many if there were only
let's say
25 percent of them coincidentally were
doing better
with the let's say social distancing at
about the same time they were also
saying hey why don't we use this
hydroxychloroquine
you could draw the chart and it would
look like
25 percent of the countries
coincidentally lined up
that you've got something that looks
like a correlation it's like hey
at about the same time they did this
hydroxychloroquine things got really
good on their curve
and then you look at it and you say well
but there were lots of countries that
were having that same curve thing
a quarter of them lined up with your
hypothesis and those are the ones that
ended up in the chart
75 of them you either didn't know or
didn't line up
and so they're not on the chart now i
don't know if i'm explaining what
happened in this specific case
what i'm trying to do is open your mind
to the understanding that that chart has
no credibility whatsoever and when you
look into who produced it who's the
original source
how they put it together you find mumbo
jumbo and
that is clearly somebody trying to hide
their identity
so you don't even know where it came
from they use words like it's randomized
when it's not which is a big red flag
and uh the whole thing looks super
sketchy
to the point where the chart producers
look
more like foreign interference than they
do like
good helpers who just want to be
anonymous
now does that mean that
hydroxychloroquine
doesn't work it does not i'm still a 30
chance it works
i'm just saying that what it would take
to convince me has never happened
so that chart complete the
all the 56 studies that are not the
right kind
not confirming anything this study is
confirming it doesn't work
complete they studied the wrong
stuff so
there's a weird situation here in which
why is it
that studying the right thing is so darn
hard
i mean we've had several full
month periods that have passed it's been
five months since the beginning
and from the very beginning we were
talking about this drug are you telling
me you can't do a one month
trial in five months when it's an
emergency no
nobody pulled that off
i'm just not buying it but here's the
other challenge i had
i have not yet heard of one case
anywhere in the world in which somebody
got the drug early
and then later died now that doesn't
mean it didn't happen
but why have i never heard of one you
know could
couldn't i get one anecdote one anecdote
of somebody who took it at the right
time didn't have some
horrible obvious comorbidity and then
went on to die
if your fake news really wants to
embarrass the president
give me some of those anecdotes sure i
know it's just anecdotes and it won't
really mean anything because
because even the proponents don't say it
saves every person in every case
they're just saying that's an amazing
difference but just show me one anecdote
of somebody who took it and died and
died anyway you can't find one you can't
find any
must be one out there somewhere all
right
let's talk about sweden um
let me check the news on sweden uh let's
see here's a story in which
uh the person writing about it says it's
absolutely true that sweden did the
right thing
okay scroll down here's another news
story that says
i've looked at sweden and they did all
the wrong things they sure lost
really nobody knows what's going on but
let me give you some insight
as to how bad the analysis of sweden is
check me on my math but see if i'm in
the neighborhood here all right
so sweden has a population of 10 million
to reach herd immunity and we'll talk
about whether
this number is is too high or not
let's say 60 infection
would get you to herd immunity
so if six million which would be sixty
percent of their total population
if six million people had it uh already
and that's what's happening because
sweden seems to be doing well
and the thought is they've reached some
kind of herd immunity
and the last i checked
the fatality rate was 3.75 percent
so 3.75 of people who get it
would die that includes you know elderly
etc
so that would imply that for sweden to
be at
60 percent herd immunity which would be
enough
that they would have 225 000 deaths
we'll get to those who are screaming at
me in the comments that it would be
much less sorry so if sweden got to herd
immunity
at the 60 level which is what most
experts say
you need to get to we would have seen
225 000
deaths what's the actual number
six right so if you thought if you think
that sweden reached
that 60 herd immunity you're
off by a lot because they would have 225
000 deaths
not 6 000. so they're nowhere near
anything like traditional herd immunity
but let's get to the second part
so there are smart people arguing that
we don't need to get
anywhere near 60 percent in fact the
number could be as low as
you know 35 percent it could be you know
it could be 20
and the reason being that's offered is
that there are so many people who have
had some related kind of coronavirus
that has some markers that are similar
enough
that your body is sort of prepped for it
but it wouldn't show up in specific
immunity
so if you if you tested somebody who was
resistant to it
because of other exposures you wouldn't
be able to test for it
they would just have some markers but
not immunity per se
but then but then in reality they just
wouldn't get it
so that you would have to include them
and then if you did the real herd
immunity could be closer to 20
or something but
sweden's still more at like uh three
percent
so even if you went all the way down to
say 20 percent gives you herd immunity
sweden's not even close to that they're
nowhere close they're not even in
you know they're not in the you know
dynamiting distance
from even the lowest 20 percent herd
immunity
but yet they seem to be doing okay
what's going on and the answer is we
don't know
we don't know we don't know we don't
know if they're doing well
we don't know why they're doing what
they're doing
but there are some other big differences
in sweden which are worth
noting one is that we talk about them
not closing their economy but that's not
exactly what happened
the the voluntary social distancing etc
were pretty well maintained
so they weren't that different from
somebody who closed their economy
they did have a better economic outcome
that
they you know they took a hit too but
not as bad as other countries
um then you'd also have to ask yourself
why is it that sweden
is doing so much better than um
the uk why is sweden doing
so much better than the uk because
if this herd immunity thing is really
really really low and this sweden
somehow hit it
how did the uk zoom right past it by by
a lot
so why would herd immunity in sweden be
down here
but herd immunity in the uk would be up
here
doesn't work does it right because
unless there's something genetic or
something about where they live
what they've been exposed to in the past
i suppose
but it seems inconsistent to me that
anybody would have
a higher death rate than anybody else if
sweden is hitting herd immunity
if you can get her immunity at that
lower level of death
wouldn't everybody be there or just
about there
i don't know um
and then it has been mentioned as the
swedes have a different lifestyle they
might spend more time alone
naturally and that they might be
healthier
they do better on vitamin d because they
supplement
because they don't get enough sun so
they supplement which might make a
difference
and apparently they have much lower
rates of
diabetes i don't know if that's true but
if you assume that the swedes have a low
african-american community
that alone would put their death rate
lower would it not
because the african-american community
in well no if it was if it were in
sweden it would be
uh just the black or the african sweden
community i guess
so the fact that we have a larger
minority population
who are tragically more susceptible to
it
that's part of the story too so maybe
sweden is just being sweden and
there's there's nothing magic happening
there all right
so here's what's not credible so far
these studies which proclaim they have
debunked
hydroxychloroquine are not credible even
the rpt ones because they studied the
wrong thing
studied it not with zinc they studied it
on deathly ill people when it's too late
so there's no good study that shows it
doesn't work
likewise there's no high quality gold
standard
that shows it does work and
the country comparisons seem completely
garbage
and i forgot to mention this but nobody
really knows
what different countries are doing with
hydroxychloroquine
nobody really knows because it's up to
the doctors and we don't know if the
doctors are really using it
they really have supply how are they
using it
kind of don't know so if you think you
can compare countries
good luck with that because you'd have
to talk to a lot of doctors in every
country to get some kind of a
representative sample all right
so here's what i think is our best hope
at this point
that the blood serum antibody treatment
will become a commercial market
uh that is our best hope i think now
my understanding is that if you take the
blood from somebody who's had it
and it's you find out that you've got
the you know the better blood there's
some some blood is better than others
for the antibodies
and you put those antibodies in somebody
it will confer some immunity
in them but it might not last forever
but it also doesn't need to
i don't think it needs to last forever
and just to give you an idea
of what a commercial market for this
would be as opposed to just
working through the normal health care
system if there were a commercial market
where somebody could offer me right now
literally today they could say if you
come into my clinic
i've already got some antibodies that
i've you know
harvested put them in your body it's
safe enough
you know i would need some evidence that
it's safe
but safe enough what would you pay for
it
and here's my answer five thousand
dollars
i would personally because i'm rich
right so you don't need to throw that in
my face
i'm rich so i would pay five thousand
dollars
to get that antibody treatment now why
would i pay
five thousand dollars two reasons one
it'd be worth it if you have the money
it'd be worth it
but two and this is just important in my
particular case that's what makes it a
market
the when the dumb rich overpay and
that's actually a market segment if
you've ever worked in corporate america
you know that the dumb rich are actually
a market segment
the people who will buy the new
expensive thing regardless of price
because they want the new expensive
thing so you sell it to the dumb rich
first because they'll buy it no matter
what
if you know if it's expensive and good
in some way
and then that drives the price down
eventually to
so that people who can afford it would
be able to afford it
so if it came out today and they said
hey it's going to be five thousand
dollars for one treatment and we don't
even know how long it'll last
i would say well first first
partly for the community the immunity
and partly to help drive down the price
because the more money we shovel at it
the more they can lower
their price so that those of you who
can't afford it would be able to and i
mean that seriously
i would i would be in line in one minute
because it would be part of a larger
good i think plus
you know might work for me too
so in my opinion that plus uh maybe
rapid testing are the two things that
could help us
the most you probably need both the
rapid testing meaning
if we could get fda approval for the the
little paper tests
it's basically a spit test you can do it
at home it won't pick up
if you just got the virus it won't pick
it up
but if you're already infectious it will
pick it up quite reliably
and so that's enough given that it might
only cost a dollar to do the test
that's enough to really really push on a
bunch of tests
you know people could test themselves
twice a day and it wouldn't be too
expensive
and so
i'm putting the odds of the vaccine
making the difference
at the odds of the vaccine making all
the difference
30 30 30 that the vaccine is the answer
the the likely answer is a
a war on every front where we're just
doing everything that works
and i think the uh the blood serum thing
is clearly going to be in that category
that's the one thing nobody doubts will
work
right i don't think there's anybody
smart
who says that the uh that the blood
serum thing
wouldn't work it just might be hard to
scale it up but i think we can figure
that out if people like me
are willing to overpay for the service
what is
uh i'm seeing percentages go by but i
don't know what you're speaking about um
a game changer is not 30 yeah
i think there's just a 30 chance that
the
virus vaccinations will make all the
difference
um somebody says the vaccine will be a
home run i like your optimism
but you know keep in mind that we
haven't been successful with these
vaccines in the past so it would be kind
of remarkable
if it worked and even if it works it
might only work at 50 percent
for 50 percent of the public and that's
according to fouchy
so fauci is warning us that getting the
shot doesn't mean you're immune
might mean you're more immune fifty
percent
you know of the people maybe something
like that
um monoclonal antibodies i have a big
question about why
we don't know what's going on with that
the idea is you take somebody's
antibodies from their blood and instead
of just
making them give more and more
antibodies you clone it
in a machine and i don't know whatever
kind of chemistry you have to do to do
that
but i don't know why we're not doing
that already
so that feels like a big black hole
of knowledge where we should really know
what's going on because that could be
easily the most
promising thing
uh ivermectin
yeah i'm reading about ivermectin but i
need to figure
out what's going on there
all right um a meth house blew up in
baltimore somebody says
how did i miss that story you have flu
shots regular flu shots don't always
work
um
feed your mitochondria
i like that comment feed your
mitochondria look it up
all right um
are you saying it will be an annual shot
oh i don't know
i doubt it
your death rate percent seems high yeah
you know you should check that
check my uh death rate
estimates because it feels like 99
of the people survive right i think the
uh the
three point whatever death rate includes
people over 80
and there are a lot of them
somebody says wrong scott regeneron is
doing trial on
antibodies they're doing a trial on it
but what part is wrong
was there something i said that violates
the fact that there's a company doing a
trial on antibodies
i don't know dow is up all right that's
all i got for now
i will talk to you later
