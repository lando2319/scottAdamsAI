well hello everybody from youtube it's
nice of you to join
i've been talking to the
subscribers on locals before you got
here
they get to get a little bit extra
that's right
by the way there are two ways to consume
this content if you didn't know that
one way
is to just listen to it for its
excellent content
and insightful analysis
the other way to listen to it is like
you're just talking to a friend who
watches the news more than you do
and you're just having coffee or you're
just working out and somebody's just
chatting
and here's the best part
if you have real friends like the you
know the kind that are in in the same
room and stuff
can you make them talk faster just by
pushing a button
you want to don't you don't you say uh
can you buzz through this story a little
bit faster i got the point on the on the
introduction
but you could do that with me
i'm your virtual digital friend
and you could just find a podcast and
hit fast forward not in the live stream
but what but if you play recorded you
can actually just make me talk faster
or
and this is the beauty part
you can make me totally shut up
if you have something else happening
let's say you get a phone call or a text
you need to handle it you could just say
shut up scott shut up
and then i'll do it
every time you just push that little
pause button
well if that's not happy enough boy do
we have some things to talk about today
is anything happening in the news
yeah
yeah
that's right soylent green in the matrix
and let's go brandon
if you'd like to take the simultaneous
sip up to a
a level which is compatible with the
excellence of the news today
all you need is a couple of micro
glasses tanker shelves to sign a canteen
juggler flash a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except the democratic turnout it's
called
the simultaneous sip it happens now
go
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
i feel my antibodies
firing up
well here's an observation i don't know
if any of you realized it but because we
live in a simulated reality
uh and the simulation likes to send us
hints about our true nature here's one
of the hints
did you ever notice that let's go
brandon
includes of course the name brandon
but have you ever thought that brandon
is
brand
don
and that donald trump
is the branding the brandingest brander
of all time he brands think he brands
his opponents he brands his business
and we're talking we have a phrase that
refers to him that's called brand
dawn
and he is actually a brand trump himself
is a brand
he's brand don
um i don't know i just thought that was
interesting
um here's i'm gonna give you a warm-up
joke
okay the first joke of the day because
there are a lot of them coming about the
headlines there are a lot of them the
first one's going to take a little bit
of work okay
so pay attention
because i'll tell you the joke but then
you have to
you have to do the work of completing
the joke in your brain
those are the best jokes
the joke where it's not complete your
brain has to complete the joke are you
ready
here it is
it's been a bad month for democrats
shooting themselves in the foot
anybody
anybody
i don't know if you saw the story about
the
the one of the crew members on the movie
rust with alec baldwin
literally shot herself in the foot
like her actual foot
she didn't just
misfire a gun
misfiring a gun
plenty bad
if you misfire a gun that's bad
but literally shooting yourself in the
foot
that actually happened now as luck would
have it it was blanks
so i don't know what damage happened but
probably not as bad as a real bullet
but yeah it's been a bad month for
democrats shooting themselves in the
foot that was just my warm-up joke
people
don't judge the rest of this by the
warm-up joke
can't judge by that all right you ready
for another one
well um
turns out that uh in new jersey and i i
i don't think this race went the way the
uh it looked but for a while there it
looked as though a truck driver in new
jersey was going to win the new jersey
state was going to beat the new jersey
state
senate president a democrat
and he was right and i think he actually
lost but he was he looks like he was had
it toward the end of the night and he
spent only two hundred dollars on his
campaign and he was a truck driver
and his name is edward durr
d-u-r-r
durr
come on
this has got to be a simulation
because i don't know if you know this
but it's a on at least on twitter
it's sort of a republican
meme thing durr
you know they just go dur
things how perfect is that last name
that he almost beat the
new jersey state senate president who's
an incumbent for years
he was almost beat by a truck driver
named dar
and that can't be more perfect the
simulation is winking at us
but my comment was is uh uh maybe we're
better off they lost because
if he if he'd won it just would have
made the supply chain problem worse
we need the truck drivers in the trucks
we don't need truck drivers running for
office and now i'm starting to wonder
is this what caused the supply chain
problem did too many truckers run for
office because it looked like it was
easier work
it is easier work than trucking and
apparently there's nothing to stop you
from winning he got pretty close but i
think he he lost in the end
all right
i told you in a prior live stream
that i was not going to make jokes about
the story that first of all i think is
fake news
i think it's fake news
that president biden had a
bowel movement in his pants in the
vatican wall eating the pope
now
maybe it could have happened if it
really happened
then i don't want to joke about it
because that's just a medical problem
and you know that's not funny
but if it didn't happen which is my
assumption that it didn't really happen
and it's just sort of a
meme idea going around well then i could
have some fun with it
then i can have some fun with it and i
think that's our situation
did you see the best meme
uh of all time going around that
uh
has a picture of biden
standing next to kamala harris
and the caption is simply
shits and giggles
okay
if there were an academy award for memes
there's your winner
shits and giggles hold on
for those of you on
youtube if you haven't seen it
uh this was just posted on locals
so shits and giggles
now
this is sort of good news bad news if
you're a humorist if you're a
professional humorist
as i am
and you see somebody pull this off
shits and giggles
it just makes you feel terrible because
you didn't think of it first
i look at this and i go oh
i do this for a living
did somebody really beat me to that
and you know maybe an amateur i hope it
was a professional at least
because as a professional i feel totally
totally lapped by this
that's really good
all right
um
so they got that going on
um
other funny stuff happening
um here's here's my own contribution
uh do you know how democrats feel this
morning
i think democrats all over the country
woke up and they felt like biden's pants
you're welcome
just put that visual in your mind yep
every democrat in the country feels like
biden's pants
right now
that was one of my jokes here's my other
joke
and you can evaluate them for me
um somebody
somebody was tweeting at me that uh
biden had uh
soiled his pants
and i said you know that's not so bad
that's called leadership
if it's true that biden crapped his
pants that is leadership because today
three quarters of democrats just woke up
and themselves
too so that's leadership
your leader goes first and three
quarters of democrats wake up and they
 their pants too when they see the
news
it's a little thing called virginia
um we'll talk about that of course in
detail coming up after the jokes got to
do the jokes first
jokes first i got priorities
there's a tweet from the last refuge i
saw today
uh and it showed a picture of a
shipping container
ship in the port and there were lots of
you know shipping containers on it
and the last refuge tweeted with that
picture
the supply chain problems caused by
mcauliffe's extra ballots from china to
be delayed
i i think i paraphrased the joke but
basically the idea was that the only
reason binded one is that the supply
chain problem causes extra ballots from
china to be delayed
just so i don't get cancelled i don't
believe that there are really extra
ballots from china delayed on the ship
just just to be clear i don't think that
was necessarily true
i can't say it wasn't true can't prove a
negative
but i don't think it's true
but it's pretty damn funny
all right uh let's talk about the
lessons
that we learned from you've all heard by
now
that the republican has unexpectedly at
least a month ago is unexpected the
republican challenger young kim
has
managed to e-count a victory actually a
pretty solid victory uh over
what they call
democratic royalty
terry mcauliffe meaning
a very established democrat with lots of
support
now
why did it happen
why did it happen
what exactly was the problem
well
i'll read you joel pollock's tweet this
morning he says the lessons of young kin
victory
hold on
hold on
a lot of the election was about school
children school children wasn't it
it was about school children that seemed
to be the biggest issue in my mind
and the guy who won was called young kim
people worried about their young
kin
voted for the guy named
young kim
people this is actually happening
there's a great book i read years ago
called the celestine prophecies has
anybody read that
that was sort of a new agey kind of a
fictional book but it talked about how
you could tell there was going to be a
giant shift
in in human perception
because it was
it was sort of let's say presaged is
that a word
it was uh we had a warning about it
insert your own perfect good word for
that what is the perfect word
uh foreshadowed
uh so that book says that big changes in
perception are foreshadowed
by coincidences so that the rate of
coincidence ramps up
right before there's a major perceptual
change in the world
now that's just a fictional
thing but we're seeing an insane amount
of coincidences aren't we
maybe it's just you know
uh just the
um confirmation bias because once you
start seeing coincidences you start
seeing more of them you know
so it's probably just a perceptual thing
but just for fun anyway back to joel
pollock's tweet about the lessons from
the young kin victory he says number one
republicans can win on education
what do you think
is that one of the lessons
the republicans can win if they focus on
education
i say true
i say true to that
but doesn't mean that's what happened
this time all right so i agree with the
premise i don't know if this proves it
because it's a one-off there's a lot
there's a lot going on with this one
case
but
people are going to believe it and i
actually think it's true i think i think
republicans can win on education even if
that's not exactly what happened here
um biden is
joel's second point is biden is a
problem for democrats
true
i think that's true yeah how about uh
accusations of racism aren't enough
well
obviously they weren't
that was not enough in virginia
trump derangement syndrome isn't enough
true
because i think they tried the trump
card but he isn't
it's as if he isn't a big enough
presence at the moment
that it doesn't have the same you know
bite it would have if you were tweeting
every day and still president
and democrats are uh too far left
but the left will say not far enough and
i think that actually happened already
right i didn't see it but my
understanding
is that
msnbc says the problem is that the
democrats didn't go far enough
and and cnn is reporting that they went
too far
is that true
if i characterize it correctly the cnn
is reporting democrats went too far
and msnbc is saying the problem is they
didn't go far enough
has anybody watched both of them enough
to know
roughly roughly
all right
so that's
uh that's one take
all right i'm gonna give you some other
possibilities things we learned number
one
well i i feel like i have to i was gonna
save this the end but i feel that's
unfair
i'm going to ruin your funnel a little
bit but then we'll get back to the fun
john harwood tweeted that biden is now
the eighth consecutive new president
to see opposition party win the virginia
governorship in his first year
that follows carter reagan
g.h.w bush clinton g.w bush obama and
trump
so
eight times in a row
we got the result we got last night
which is the winner in virginia is the
opposite of the president who just got
elected
eight times in a row
do you think that's a coincidence
because apparently it doesn't matter
which party the president is
virginia's just going to go the opposite
direction
so
is it possible
that none of the stuff we're talking
about mattered at all
yeah
yeah
yeah it's not only possible it's
probable
it's probable that literally nothing
happened
it just went the way it always goes and
we're treating it like it's this giant
earthquake tsunami
but maybe
it's just the way it always goes
this way it's going eight times in a row
so but
i think that's too simplistic because
there are obviously reasons
there are reasons things go the way they
go and i think that beating a terry
mcauliffe
is sort of a bigger deal than beating
somebody who isn't terry mcauliffe is
that a fair statement
that beating terry mcauliffe is probably
a bigger deal
than you know an ordinary
governor race
so maybe this is special
maybe it's not i'll give you my take on
this in a moment
all right
um
my take is i didn't spend a lot of time
listening to the candidates talk but
having heard mcauliffe talk in public
you know just clips
and hearing young can talk in public
which one of them is the better
communicator slash persuader
now again forget politics
right because i think we would agree
that say obama for example was a great
communicator and a great persuader even
if you hated him as a president
bill clinton
great communicator great politician
even if he didn't like his policies
right
but and then you know the opposite
hillary clinton
terrible communicator etc so i think we
can we could be objective about
both parties right if you were to just
look at him objectively just on the
skill of a communicator who is better
who is better
having a little problem over here
let's do this
somebody's saying mcauliffe
i thought mcauliffe is a whiny
whiny average communicator
whiny and average
i thought that young kin's uh
presentation
the i would say the confidence of his
voice
and and how capably he shaped his
message was better
so i think the better candidate won
could that be just the whole story
you know if we knew it was going to be
close
and one candidate is just more capable
than the other one is there anything
else to talk about
because that could be the whole thing
in my mind he just his voice
and the way he presented himself was
just more leaderly
and mcauliffe seemed weak and whiny and
sort of irrational
i just didn't think it was close in
terms of their their personal approach
now um
here's another thing
critical race theory is democratic
suicide
another theory is that it wouldn't
matter who the candidates were critical
race theory had
finally reached a level
where
white people especially
weren't going to take it anymore of
course they're not alone there are
plenty of black people who are saying
hold on a second
hold on a second we wouldn't like this
if this were the other way around
why don't we treat everybody equally and
you know maybe try to get along or
whatever so certainly there are no there
are no ethnic you know unified
everybody's on the same side of this or
anything else
um
but uh
i i've got a feeling that uh
a an opening has been made
that well let's put it this way
permission to swear
anybody
permission to swear
i'd like uh
i'd like to use uh one well-placed curse
word
to describe a specific point
and i think oh i got a yes that's all i
needed i only needed one yes
for some reason the comments have
stopped on
local so i'm going to have to
restart
not the feed so the feed will be the
same
but i have to restart the
comment where i was looking at there
hold on one second i know this is
fascinating to watch me fuss with my
technology but it's worth it
totally worth oh
all right
i got a problem
okay
um
so my my technology just went crazy on
one of my ipads so i'm still watching
the feed
for uh
so i still have a feed for locals but
the comments are delayed at the moment
all right um here's what i think
and you gave me permission to swear so
i'm going to do it now
i have a theory about white people
and of course any theory about any group
doesn't apply to all people right
could we agree that nothing applies to
all members of a group so we're i think
we're adult enough to say that
here's just an impression and i want to
see how many people agree with me
that there's a characteristic of white
people
that is slightly different
and this could be just a racist comment
so maybe you'll tell me it seems
different than the way black people
handle the same issues on average right
every individual is different don't have
to say that every time
it goes like this
if you
if you uh
confront a black man or woman in america
with some annoyance
they're probably going to let you know
about it would you agree
that a black man or woman if you do some
kind of injustice or in fairness and and
they're there
they're going to tell you about it
right away
right
would you say that's a fair statement
compare that to
the average white person
i feel as though you can push white
people pretty far
and you don't know how far you've pushed
them because they don't tell
you oops okay well i'm not going to die
on that hill today that
a famous white person saying
maybe every maybe everybody says it but
i only hear from white people is
uh you don't want to die on that hill
today
that fight is not worth having
that's too small
you know worry about other things
but
white people have this other quality
which is they'll bend and they'll bend
and they'll bend
but when they break
get out of the way
it's just sort of a
stereotype right and and i won't say
there's any science so this is just a
personal observation it feels to be and
i would guess that this has
everything to do with the experience in
the history
that when black people are pushed
they push back right away
makes sense right it would make sense
from a historical
experiential
perspective that they don't they don't
want to take anything because if you
push them a little
it feels like it's going to continue
right
so it feels like
a black man or woman in america if you
push them they're going to push back
pretty pretty aggressively and right
away now i'm not saying one of these is
a better approach than the other
so hear this clearly i'm not i'm not
saying one is a good system one's a bad
system i don't know i don't even know
which is better
but i feel that white people on average
will let you push them and push them and
push them
until
they become mass shooters
am i right if you look at all these mass
shooters that are white
often they were bullied
and they didn't didn't didn't push back
didn't push back didn't push back didn't
push back
and then bought a gun
i think um
damn it
uh okay so i'm seeing some comments now
from locals good
um
so i'm wondering if the if what we saw
in virginia was simply uh
uh
a lot of the white public and of course
a lot of democrats
you know must have crossed over probably
of all types
i'm wondering if they just reached the
limit
and said and and i'm going to use
another swear word are you ready
i'm willing to take that abuse
okay i'll take that one too
all right
i'll take that too
oh wait a minute you just with my
kids
now we're done
that feels like what happened
i'm willing to take some higher taxes
yeah i don't want to die on that hill
i'm willing to wear a mask for a while
i hope it's temporary
i don't want to die on that hill
oh you know they're they're calling me a
racist god i hate that but you know i
don't want to die on that hill
oh they're making me get a vaccination
damn it damn it i really maybe i'll make
a stand now
no it might be temporary i don't want to
die on that hill
now we're going to ruin your children
okay we're done now
you pushed too far
and i think what i see our the critical
race theory stuff is
is that a lot of people say wait a
minute you're ruining my kid
you're breaking my kit
you just reached the limit
they're with your kids are you
going to die on that hill
yup
if they with your kids
you're gonna die on the hill
no question about it
i think that's what happened and i think
that all that happened mainly is that
enough people became informed
what was actually happening to their
kids
am i right
i think as soon as white virginians and
probably you know
of course there's no generalizations
that that hold lots of other people too
probably said
uh probably people of every ethnicity
said
wait a minute wait a minute now you're
 with our kids
we're done here
it could be just that and maybe nothing
else mattered
i don't know
all right um
i believe that democrats have chosen a
strategy of self-immolation but
the hard part is i don't think they can
get back
do you
now of course anytime you say this the
pendulum just swings back you a few
months ago we were saying oh republicans
are dead forever and they'll never have
a good time again
that might have been true if biden did a
good job
or if things in just in the world in
general had gone his way maybe just got
lucky
maybe republicans would be in trouble
but as it turns out literally everything
in the world turned bad as soon as trump
got out of the office i mean the
pandemic started when he was in office
but it seems like
from the economy to immigration to you
know
relations with china to everything it
just seems worse energy
you know it's hard to think of something
that got better
so under that context
i don't see how the democrats can
recover
do you
i think that the republicans just
discovered their soft underbelly
the children
and by the way this is not a political
strategy
it's actually trying to save the
children
like literally it's not there's nothing
political about it like when the when
the children become the topic
politics just goes out the door
it's like yeah yeah i'm a democrat but
don't with my children
you know that's just too that's too far
went too far
um i see senior rude says i think you're
wrong yeah you know if you were to bet
on it
what would be the smart bet the pendulum
or that the democrats have just really
ended themselves which would be the
smarter bet
always the pendulum
it's always the pendulum yeah so if you
want to bet on it bet on the pendulum
likewise if you were going to bet on
this race
had i known that seven times in a row
the governorship goes in a predictable
way opposite of the president in the
first term
if i'd known that which i didn't
i probably would have put a sizable bet
on yonkin without even knowing anything
about the race
because it looks like it's pretty
predictive
now i think the public quite rightfully
likes
divided governments
that might be the smartest thing that
americans do
if you think about it
you know we complain about it non-stop
about our you know our
our constipated government but it's
pretty clear we like it
because the alternative has lots of
problems and worse problems than divided
government
so
um but take a look at
how far democrats have jumped the shark
and you tell me if they can find their
way back from this
jamel hill
tweeted today it's not the messaging
folks
this country simply loves white
supremacy
doesn't that feel
too far
that's a little too far isn't it
you know
you can take a lot of ridiculousness
but then there's some point where it
just simply jumps the shark as they like
to say now jumping the shark if you're
from another country you're not used to
that saying
it just refers to something that goes so
far it's changed its basic nature into
something you don't want
so when a tv show
starts introducing you know
crazy things that you say oh jump the
shark it's based on an old happy days tv
show
thing where fonzie literally went water
skiing and jumped over a shark that was
in the water
it was just ridiculous it had nothing to
do with the way the show used to be so
that was called jumping the shark anyway
uh
when you see somebody
literally saying that white supremacy is
what caused the
the election to go the way it did when
there are so many other reasons
so many other reasons
this is probably the smallest of the
reasons
and
i think
they have trapped themselves
because here's the thing in order to
find their way back and we'll talk about
um
van jones here in a minute
in order to find your way back from how
badly things are looking at this point
for democrats they would have to admit
they were wrong
about a lot
right
how in the world
how in the world do you admit you were
wrong about such basic things
you know about how to
how to tax how to how to do everything
how do you admit you're wrong about it
and if they don't admit they're wrong i
don't know if they can ever win again
because what are they gonna do is say
you know
we like
we like all the socialism stuff but yeah
we have to admit you're right about the
school choice stuff
so i guess we'll we'll change our mind
on some of the school stuff and the
critical race theory do you think that's
going to happen
i don't see it happening
i i think they're sort of an all or none
category they've decided this is their
set of issues i don't think it's going
to change
not within the next few election cycles
right it'll change in the long run in
the long run you can always bet on the
pendulum in the long run but i think you
can't move a ship this big that's moving
this fast this long
you can't move it in the next few years
so i think for the next few years
it's going to be all republicans
it looks like
now the wild card of course is trump
himself coming back into the mix
have you noticed that trump without the
um
without trump as the one who's drawing
all the provocation
if you just take trumpism
so say just the policy part of it or the
philosophical part of it
it plays pretty well doesn't it because
if you take sort of a trump
approach to the world and you just put
it into a ron desantis
people just say well that looks good
if you put it into a trump then it
becomes about trump
and then you know everything's wacky
after that
so
i think one of the things that happened
is that trump wins
wins i mean not just the election but i
think trump wins and that he's sort of
demonstrated his approach was more right
um and the country seems to be shifting
his way quite quite strongly
um so from the
perspective of
election planning and strategy i think
the democrats just learned
that child abuse is not as popular as
they had hoped
um
rasmussen nasa po as a poll they said
has canceled culture gotten out of
control
72 of likely voters
say yes
that's all voters that's democrats
republicans and independents 72 percent
say canceled culture has gotten out of
control
that's what jumping the shark is
it's this that this number says they
jumped the shark
because you would expect something
closer to 50 50 for everything really if
it's democrats versus
republicans
all right
here's a perceptual shift
you can also see the the shark jumping
in this following story
for
how many years
25 years or so
i've been telling a story in public
about how in my two corporate careers i
was a banker and then i worked for local
phone company
then both of those careers i had to
leave the the jobs because my bosses
told me directly we can't promote you
because you're white and male
now i've been telling that for 25 years
and whenever i say it
what response have i gotten until this
year
until this year the response changed
for 24 of those years
immediately if i said it on twitter for
example no matter where i said it the
comments would fill up with well that's
a lie
that's a lie
that did not happen
you did not
lose your job or your career because
somebody told you they can't promote
white male people that never happened
do you know what happens when i tell
that story today
nothing
nothing
it just happened this year in the
following year
people stopped doubting the truth of
that story
that's a pretty big perceptual shift
now i don't think it's because they
believe me more
like i don't think i became more
credible this year
you know
certainly not
i think that people understand it is
true because they've seen enough other
things that this is just right in the
sweet spot of all those things they know
to be true so why wouldn't it be true
why would i lie about it i mean i don't
really have an incentive to do that
so that's that to me that's a big shift
that people will accept that as well it
could be true
i have a theory for you
that
did you know there are two kinds of
narcissists
there are vulnerable narcissists and
then there are grandiose narcissists
and they have very very different
qualities
one of them isn't even bad
if you're a grandiose narcissist you try
to get credit from other people you know
you want to be loved
because you did good things for the
public
is that bad
you can say it's a personality disorder
but is people doing good things for the
public and they want to be recognized
for it
like me
so i i label myself
a um grandiose narcissist
because i fit the description it's not a
medical diagnosis but i certainly fit
the checklist
i do things in public like i'm doing
right now
because i think it will help the public
and then the public will say hey good
job scott
and then i'll feel good it'll make me
feel oh okay
thanks i appreciate your
you know i appreciate your appreciation
of me
now
is that bad
you know if i could cure myself of this
problem should i
do you want me to
right i realize this and of course i am
aware that it's obnoxious you know if i
claim credit for things etc it's
obnoxious
i know that
but it has a utility to it so i do it
anyway
but the other kind is called a
vulnerable narcissist i'm going to
describe some of the qualities that are
typical of a vulnerable vulnerable
narcissist and you tell me does this
sound more like a
democrat or a
republican
okay
so a vulnerable narcissist they like to
project
so that an example of projection would
be if somebody is a racist
and they call you a racist when you're
not
that's called projecting do you see the
democrats acting like
obvious racists
and accusing people who are clearly not
of being racist
fair do you see that happening
i think so
right
i think that's the main characteristic
of the democrats is being racist
and accusing people who are not in any
practical way they might be in their
heads but not in any real world you know
way that they're trying to change policy
or something
so that's one
they are
vulnerable narcissists are always
cheaters
vulnerable narcissists are always
cheaters
have the democrats demonstrated any
cheating
have you seen any cheating
depends who you ask
now i think the the shenanigans with the
elections
the ones we know about the one the ones
that are confirmed were all legal it was
legal shenanigans
but it feels like cheating doesn't it
doesn't it feel like cheating it was all
legal
but it feels like cheating
here's another quality of vulnerable
narcissists
they attack the messenger instead of the
message
do you see the
do you see the democrats attacking
the person or the policy
it's always the person isn't it they
attack trump
they attack trump supporters
for being racist
where's the policy discussion
attacking the messenger is a vulnerable
narcissist
attacking the message
would be somebody maybe who has an
argument
so
i would encourage you to learn what a
vulnerable narcissist is
and look at how democrats collectively
act and ask yourself if you're looking
at a political movement or a personality
disorder in which all the people who
have a similar personality disorder have
banded together and called themselves
democrats
right as bradley says it's always
personal
it looks like it's political but it's
always personal
um
am i off base it's just a hypothesis
right i'm just putting it out there but
does anybody else see this
now take the republicans
i think republicans are more likely to
lean toward the grandiose narcissism
trump
does trump
look like somebody who wants to get
credit for saving the world
yeah
yeah
do you do you think he doesn't want
credit for it like to be appreciated if
he succeeds
hell yeah anything wrong with that
i don't know it's considered some kind
of a personality flaw but
are you okay with it
oh somebody says michael savage has a
book about this very topic well he's a
lot
smarter than i am
academically so if he's known to if he
noticed the same thing then i would give
that some some weight
all right
let's see what else is going on
oh and also
narcissists think they're smarter than
you right and better than you
does trump act like he's smarter and
better than
democrats
does trump ever say i'm a better person
than you are you you democrats in
general he does of course go after the
leaders
but does he go after the people
no does he go after the people
does he go after the ideas and the
leaders
i don't think he goes after the public
i don't think he does that but uh but
democrats do democrats go after the
public
all right
do democrats um think that they're
smarter than you
do democrats think that they're superior
to you morally and intellectually
let's say you being is is a republican
yes
it's their main theme is that they're
smarter than you
they're more moral
more fair
more open-minded more more woke they're
better than you
that is a personality disorder
i'm sorry that's what it is it's a
personality disorder
i don't see i don't see republicans
doing that
republicans tend to say
everybody's equal under god let's see if
we can make the system work that way
you know we fail
you know we be anybody who tries to make
the system fair we we fail
but i'm pretty sure they're trying
i'm pretty sure they want it to work
that way
all right um
so that's my case for that now van jones
uh he's all over twitter today
clips of him
because he seems to be uh
the let's say the most reasonable of the
democrats one of the people who i would
say can see the other side even if he
doesn't agree
now of course he you know plays a role
on cnn and he you know plays his biased
partisan role but it's pretty clear when
he talks about what works and what
doesn't
it's obvious he can see the whole field
and that's different
because i don't think that most of the
pundits actually can even see the whole
field they can see their side in their
argument but they're they're blind to
the other organ
van jones is making the same point he
thinks
he thinks the democrats might be blind
to um
he says they have to look in the mirror
and says their message might be annoying
offensive and out of touch and coming
across in ways we meaning democrats
don't realize or recognize
what do you think
do you think the democrats are oblivious
to how they're being received
i think so
they're either oblivious or they don't
care
which
you know same kind of problem
so van says that trumpism is like the
delta variant or no he called yunkan the
delta variant of trumpism it's the same
disease but spreads faster
now of course that sounds you know
negative for trump and trumpism of
course and he means it that way
but i wouldn't take it too much you know
somebody said he's he's calling us a
disease or something i don't think
that's happening i think it's just a
funny analogy
um
but
he's getting a lot of play on cnn and
should
because he's got the best i think he has
the best take on on everything that
happened
um and i think uh you know jake tapper
etc
i think he's seeing it too i think jake
can see the whole field as well
so that's what's going on
and of course you want me to mention
that the lieutenant governor-elect who
is a black woman ex-marine and immigrant
or or child of immigrants i can't
remember
but she won and her name is winsome
winsome spears
spears is awesome to begin with because
you know spear sounds like a you know
offensive weapon so that's all awesome
to begin with and their first name is
winsome winsome
how awesome is that
it's almost as good as
starting a casino
in vegas and your last name is win
w-y-n-n that happened too
and that worked out pretty well for
steve wynn
so yeah her name is winsome and of
course uh a number of the people who
were elected in virginia were not white
men and so all the claims of racism will
just look ridiculous today
all right um
i don't think that democrats quite
realize
that
uh trump is the result of their policies
here's a here's a lesson that i teach
people all the time
we as human beings are really bad at
recognizing where power lies
and how to use it
people like trump
who is an energy monster can see energy
can see power and he knows how to use it
and that's in some ways that's what
makes him scary is that he's so good at
that
but
and here's an example i like to use lot
we often think that the boss has power
and the employee doesn't
but you forget how much the boss needs
good employees and how hard it is to
find them
so employees have tons of power they
just don't know it
same with kids you say to yourself well
kids don't have any power
but if kids collectively
walk down the school and said you know
we're not going to do critical race
training
they could make it happen you don't
think kids if they acted collectively
they just say look
i know we're just kids but we're just
going to walk out of this class
every time
they would change the class immediately
so the kids have as much power as they
want and you don't recognize it because
they don't use it but if they did they'd
have all they wanted it's just they
don't agree
on what to do or you know maybe don't
care but if they wanted it
they could have it
so power power is often
sort of
mistakenly attributed to the wrong place
and
i would say in this case the people the
democrats look at trump
and say trump is the reason for the
attitudes and you know the approaches
and stuff of the democrats he's not
he's the outcome
he's the outcome of all this he's the
result
now he becomes the active player once
he's in power but
it's the democrats policies that made
trump possible if democrats
managed differently
you couldn't even have a trump
the democrats have the power
to make or break trump
but they don't know how to do it the way
to do it is to change their policies
and but that's i think that's invisible
they don't understand that they make
trump powerful
by how they act if they acted
differently all of his power would go
away
tomorrow
in fact if democrats just said
and this will never happen but imagine
if van jones
became the adviser to the democrats and
and they listen to him
it's not going to happen
but just imagine and they say okay just
tell us what to do van you're the only
one who's figured this out just tell us
what to do i think he'd say
stop talking about race
and just watch what happens
just stop talking about race take it out
of the schools just see what happens
and then the democrats would sweep
that's what would happen
they would sweep
but they can't do it because whatever is
driving them is either this you know
vulnerable narcissism or something i
don't know fake news who knows some some
mad soup of awesome awfulness
but
they have the power to win easily
and then once they're in power they can
make you know some policies that they
think improve things but they don't
realize they're in power i think that's
part of the problem
all right let me make one point that
oh and apparently china just announced
they're going to make 150 new nuclear
power plants reactors
in the next um
15 years
let me say that again
do you know how long it takes to build a
new nuclear power plant in the united
states
20 years
because of all the regulations and
approvals and stuff about 20 years
china's going to build 150 of them in
15.
and i think they might do it like this
seems within within the realm of
something they could do
it's pretty aggressive
and how about the united states
um we're gonna decommission
we are so wrong on this
so wrong and by the way
trump wasn't that much better on this
both biden and trump are pro-nuclear and
the department of energy looks like
they've done good work
uh promoting it
but not even close to what they should
be doing
neither biden or trump are anywhere near
the right answer on this they have the
right answer but they're not pushing it
in
in their productive enough way
so
that's a criticism of both presidents
um all right on a different topic
are we done talking about virginia
well here here's a comment on the locals
platform every time i fill up with gas i
hate biden
has anybody had that same reaction
because that's a pretty insightful
comment
do you feel every time you fill up the
gas tank
that you hate biden because he's the
reason you're paying double
right and you know that
it's his policies
yeah
yeah that you know we look at all these
uh like big causes it might be as simple
as people fill up their gas once a week
and once a week there they curse at the
president for making them spend double
and that's the the thing that touches
their life
the most directly besides crt depending
on where you are
could be that
um i would like to add this uh
contrarian idea
to
um the mix now i'm gonna change topics
so ana politics for just a moment
everybody says we should trust the
experts do you agree
you should trust the experts now we know
that experts have gotten a lot of things
wrong
so you know you have to be skeptical
but
would you trust an expert versus someone
who is not an expert in the field
let's say there was a debate
between a bona fide expert and somebody
who's not an expert in the field who's
who's better in that debate the expert
or the non-expert
the answer is it depends
the answer is it depends
that's right some experts are so bad
that an amateur can be better
it has been my experience
that i have encountered a number of
experts who simply because i'm
reasonably smart and well informed
are not as capable as i am in their
expertise
i hate to say it but can i get a
confirmation from those of you who are
unusually smart
how many of you
you can you don't have to be humble if
you're unusually smart and that would
apply to a lot of people watching this
this uh live stream
if you're unusually smart if you ever
had the experience of knowing more than
an expert and you knew it
at least on the topic you were you were
dealing with not on everything so maybe
not an expert you know on everything but
you know your little slice
so here's what i'm going to propose
because i think everybody gets this
wrong when looking at people's opinions
you ready for this this is going to hurt
those of you who had not thought in this
way before this is going to hurt a
little bit
here's my claim
a smart engineer and i'll just use an
engineer as my example because they're
good at analyzing stuff a smart engineer
can do a deep dive on one slice
of a medical expert's larger field and
come up with a more credible opinion on
that one slice
than most experts in the same space
true or false
let me give you an example i remember a
case where who is one of the founders of
intel
andy grove andy grove came down with
he had prostate cancer
and
the medical opinions about prostate
cancer were all over the board and
different experts were
saying you know surgery no surgery all
kinds of stuff
so he was a very smart engineer so he
decided to become an expert on this one
little slice
which is how do you treat
this specific prostate cancer
and so he wrote a large article about it
in forbes or fortune or something and it
was probably the best
most informative and useful analysis of
what to do if you have prostate cancer
that has ever been created
and i believe that he would have been
more of an expert
than all of the experts on his narrow
question
right on the narrow question now you say
to yourself scott the trouble is
if he's just trying to be an expert on
the narrow slice he's going to forget
maybe some variables from you know
related stuff that actually make a
difference
to which i say no he checked that
because he checked everything with the
experts
he said am i missing anything you know
did i leave anything out
and if they say no that looks pretty
good then he doesn't have to worry about
that so
let me say it again
a smart
non-expert
can can come to understand much better
than the experts can
if it's a narrow slice
and they they do their homework and we
see that
we do see people doing a deep dive on a
narrow slice
but here's my own uh my own example of
it and then i got to go
i had a exotic problem called the
spasmodic dysphonia
i couldn't speak
i couldn't speak for three and a half
years
and i went to my doctor had no idea what
it was went to my other doctor had no
idea what it was went to my emt
now i've gone to the expert of the
experts the ear nose throat expert
didn't know what it was
i googled it
and finally i guessed the right search
term and i found it found out it was
something called spasmodic dysphonia and
then i taught my doctors what it was
is that uncommon
nope
i was a smart
amateur who did a deep dive on the
narrowest of narrowness
something that even an ear-nosed throat
person had never even heard the words
before
and that's how narrow it was and did i
know more than them when i was done
absolutely yeah
when i was done i knew more than
i would say
conservatively 99 of all doctors
about just that one one little thing and
how did i know i talked to the one
doctor who knew the most
now if i'd met that one doctor
that one doctor would have known more
than me
but
all the rest of the doctors i knew more
than them
because i talked in person to the one
person in the world who knew more about
it than anything and cured me
because every other doctor said it was
incurable
one said it wasn't
i took his opinion
and now i can talk to you
that's the only reason i can talk to you
right now is that i did a deep dive and
the experts couldn't find the thing i
found
very common all right gotta go
hope today was fun hope you enjoyed it
and i can't stay gotta gotta do
something else but i would love to stay
another hour because today was a fun day
bye for now
