good morning everybody
and welcome
to coffee with scott adams
it's probably the best thing that's
going to happen to you all year
and uh if i have anything to do with it
i'm gonna make this even better
even better no i know it seems
impossible doesn't it yeah
yeah it always seems that way and then
then i do it
watch this
grab your uh copper marker glass tank or
jealous time can't change a flask or
vessel of any kind
fill it with
that's right your favorite liquid
and i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine here the day
the thing that makes
everything better
no including that
now including that
no there's no exception it makes
everything better get ready
go
well
only the people on locals will know how
i feel
i'll tell you later
really good
so alec baldwin continues to claim that
he did not have his
finger on the trigger
when that gun went off on the set of
rust and there's apparently there's
somebody on set who who is backing him
up on that
and says they had his his finger sort of
straight you know not on the
his finger was like straight along the
barrel line
[Music]
maybe
maybe and he claims that he would never
point a gun at someone and then pull the
trigger
so all of you gun owners are happy with
that right
everybody who owns a
gun those of you who are good with gun
safety
as long as you point the loaded gun at
somebody's head
but you don't pull the trigger
you're good right
no
[Laughter]
you know what's the saddest thing about
this
is that i thought that you know despite
the tragedy
that we you know shouldn't ignore uh
despite the tragedy i thought that this
would
teach people about gun safety
and it didn't
it didn't
you know i don't know who was advising
alec baldwin on the pr but number one
should have said he didn't have his
finger on the trigger on day one
but
but
he should also say
you know under any other conditions it
would be a gigantic mistake to point a
gun to somebody but i thought under
these specific conditions
the proper controls had been in place
but whatever you do don't ever point a
gun at somebody because i think we've
learned from from this that that's not
safe enough
wouldn't you want to hear that
but i guess that would maybe put him in
a little bit of legal jeopardy
you know if he were to make any
any concession toward gun safety so
that's a shame because the public should
be learning that it wasn't just the
trigger part
it was a problem it was not checking it
himself
it was pointing at a human being or
anything that he didn't want to bullet
in
and then assuming that he'd done enough
because he didn't pull the trigger
wow
well uh tulsi gabbard is
uh saying something pretty interesting
um and i'm gonna pass along without an
opinion on
the medical truth of it because how
would i know right
but tulsi is
did a little video and saying that the
so-called covent pill
that we're all excited about
might uh might encourage variance
now i don't know if that's true
but you know i'd worry about it but i i
don't know if it's true
however
let me let me just put this out there if
i told you to follow the money predicts
very well
of course
do you realize we got ourselves into a
situation
where the the only people who can fix
this you know this virus problem from a
scientific point of view
have a huge incentive not to
that's not my imagination right
they have a huge incentive to beat every
variant
one at a time
am i right
they have no incentive to be all the
variants because that's when the money
stops
all of their incentive is to be one
variant at a time
in a way that guarantees more variance
sorry
if you had to if you had to make a
prediction based on their business model
you would have to assume the pandemic
would be perpetual
based on the business model
now i don't know anything like this
could be perpetual
but i don't know how it can't
yeah you've got two
you've got two forces that are both
i don't know predictably impossible not
to be true
it's impossible that this doesn't stop
at the same time
the pharma big business model makes it
impossible that it will stop
impossible that it can't and impossible
that it will at the same time so this
one's a hard one to predict
um i tend to be optimistic so i like to
think we're going to get out of this one
way or another i mean at some point you
reach something like
herd immunity even with the variants i
would imagine that would be my guess
anyway uh
more in the
to add to the list of
things that trump did right that biden
said was wrong
were wrong
and uh biden had to uh change his policy
to just do what trump did now these
apparently the courts had something to
do with this but biden
is going to keep the remain in mexico
program and here's the fun part
expand it
to include haitians
now i didn't read the article so i
assume that means
haitians who are coming up through the
you know mexico american border
but
imagine if imagine if trump had done
this
you know to expand it to include
haitians
it seems like
huh
it seems like the biden administration
is targeting people of color
because first it was the immigrants
coming from mexico and then it was the
central americans and
again brown
and then we've had this next category of
haitians what do they all have in common
well they're not white like joe biden
that's for sure
racist
racist
i learned to do this from cnn
normally i would just ignore this sort
of thing and say oh
looks like an immigration problem
better tighten that up oh good job he's
tightening it up against all the people
who are coming in
nope
nope i'm going to take the cnn msnbc
method and say that
hey if the immigrants are brown
somebody needs to explain what joe biden
is doing about the norwegian illegal
immigrants
which we never hear about do we has joe
biden said one thing
about
keeping the norwegian
illegal immigrants out of the country no
nothing not a word not a word why
norwegians are white
mostly
and that's a clear indication that the
president biden
has some bias against the
countries he doesn't use those words but
i'm sure he's thinking them because
remember
it used to be that you could report the
news based on what people actually said
or did
but today
it's quite common
to judge people based on what you're
pretty sure they're thinking
pretty sure they're thinking
so i follow that model
well the media disinformation
machine is going nuts and
i like to
remind people
that if their worldview
which sometimes i call a frame you know
your way of looking at a topic
if the frame you're using to examine a
topic
does not predict
maybe try another one
because uh because a view of reality
that predicts what will happen next is
probably the good one
doesn't mean it's true
but if it predicts that's about as good
as you can do
so here's a tweet by mike cernovich he
said
january 6 was 11 months ago so it's
coming up on a year
and he said zero people have been
charged with insurrection
okay
how did your filter on reality
square with that prediction
my prediction was
i didn't see any insurrection
i didn't see it i saw people who were
you know lightly armed with small clubs
and stuff and stuff but i didn't see
anything that would look like an attempt
at an insurrection in fact
it looked exactly the opposite
it looked like people tried to stop
what they believed
was an insurrection
it looked the opposite to me
now that was my filter on reality so my
filter said since there was no
insurrection
nobody would be charged with it or at
least nobody would be convicted of it
so my my worldview is intact
and there's no trigger for cognitive
dissonance
dissonance gets triggered when your
world view doesn't match what you're
observing
why it's perfect
just what i thought would happen
so
examine your uh
your world view there now i got a a
tweet comment on this from user on
twitter invisiblegorilla
who
showed an article that quote that said
quote legal experts have stated that
insurrection is borderline impossible to
prove in court and thus this
prosecutorial tool has largely been left
on the shelf
i think that's a general comment not
just about this situation
but
so i guess insurrection is almost
impossible to prove in court
do you know what would make it even
harder to prove in court
well i'm no legal scholar
so i'll need a fact check on this but
could i say
that insurrection would be harder to
prove in court
if it never happened
and everything involved was on 50
million videos
again i'm not a legal scholar so i think
that when it doesn't happen it's a
little extra harder to prove
so maybe that's what happened
i saw a tweet
from ian bartisis today
referring to an article
written by
general hayden you remember him
remember general hayden
general hayden was
a retired four-star general
so this is important listen to his
resume
retired four-star general
and he was also the director of the cia
from 2006 to 2009
and before that director of national
security agency
so he's the ex-head of the cia
and in his article
as uh pointed out by uh ian
uh who read the article and pointed me
to it
uh he he refers to the charlottesville
hoax as if it's real
claims with no evidence that the
journalists and scientists are
truth-tellers
the cia is telling us that the
journalists and scientists are the
truth-tellers
what country is he living in
has he been around lately
and then also
he called rioters uh protesters you know
the riots from
the summers
uh who clashed with police and he calls
it january 6 an insurrection
now
this is the ex-head of the cia
who's still calling this an insurrection
and still saying that charlottesville
uh you know that
i assume that he's referring to the
president's comments about
charlottesville which are part of the
hoax
and
could you have a more clear
signal
that the cia is not on the side of the
american public
i mean that's what i see
and
i i i feel as if ex-heads of the cia
should not talk in public
there should be rule that says they just
can't talk in public i mean it's
probably totally unenforceable but
we're unconstitutional
but this is damaging
because whatever tiny bit of trust you
had in the cia it has to go away after
this
this guy was the head of the cia and
he's a bold-faced
liar who's clearly working against the
interests of the country if if i'm to
believe this
and by the way this is not him being
quoted so much as you know based on an
article he wrote
it's you know an article in his own
words
and
yeah you know it's one thing to uh
to not trust the cia entirely
but this is different
right this is
this is so bad it's almost you can't
hold it in your head
remember i told you that the best
hypnotist could operate right in front
of you and you wouldn't be able to see
it because if your imagination can't
include it
it's just sort of invisible to you
psychologically invisible
and here's one of those cases
the cia is so
corrupt
based on this you know one
ex-head of the cia who was pretty recent
um
i can't hold this in my head
i can't hold it in my head i'm reading
it i'm looking at it
and in five minutes i'll forget about it
and think about something else
it's like it's like i can't i can't put
it in my head and keep it there because
it's too outside my imagination that the
cia is literally an enemy of the people
or at least was
you know as far as this guy goes
and it looks like that continued under
brandon etc
so
i just don't even know how to process
this this is beyond processing right
is anybody else having the same
experience
yeah write it down tape it to the wall
yeah your brain can't handle this is too
big
it's weird i can feel it
i can feel it happening to me and i
still am powerless to resist
um
how many situations are there now that
trump was
unambiguously right about
how long is the list now
certainly write about china
write about immigration
right
uh right about the borders right
um what else
write about energy energy prices by the
way did you see the uh the dc ccc some
democrat group
tried to tweet a graph
that showed uh
that biden had reduced
gas prices by releasing the reserves
except they gained the y-axis
so that a two-cent reduction
which could have been totally random by
the way the two-cent reduction looked
like a steep decline in prices and they
actually had the temerity to tweet that
 thing
which got caught immediately you know
immediately spotted
uh by uh
by a number of people including
the panda the panda tribune
um
and i think it was based there's some
suspicion that was based on a parody
that somebody did a parody tweet that
looked just like it it looks like they
didn't they couldn't tell it was parody
and they may have just tweeted
themselves
so parody and reality have merged
but
i have a question about climate change
have you seen uh data that says that
the co2 level has stayed constant for
the last 10 years
is that is that considered
scientifically valid at this point
some i saw a michael schallenberger
article that mentions that
10 years it's been flat now that's not
enough to lower the temperature
because that that baseline amount would
according to the scientists
still raised the temperature too much
over time so you'd have to you'd have to
take it down to closer to zero to
actually
change the temperature
from rising anyway according to the
scientists
um
so i have this feeling
and then then the second part is the
financial part of it
and it's starting to look as if the
financial estimates of
climate change destruction are just
completely
garbage because it turns out we're
really good at adjusting
let me let me give you one of the
best
let's say models for understanding the
world that there is
a long time ago when let's say my
parents
wanted some entertainment they would
gather around the radio
because that's all they had
so they gathered around the radio
and that was sort of a tradition
then television came out
what did all the smart people predict
about television
well it would it would kill radio right
the most obvious prediction you could
make
is that a television would make radio
obsolete
except they're radios and cars
and there's a new car produced
you know every second
so
then there was talk radio and political
talk on radio and then it was fm
so
every time you predict that something's
going to go out of business
pretty soon
it's hard to do i'll give you another
one
when i started cartooning in the late
80s was when i first tried to get into
it
it was it was already becoming obvious
that newspapers would die
uh and every five years i'd say to
myself well it's not gonna last another
five years i'd better get myself a new
career
and as of today
33 almost years later
there are still newspapers
what
how is that even possible but the
simplest thing that you could have
predicted
is that
newspapers would all go out of business
so it turns out that the reason they
still exist is that they were cash cows
in the first place so they they had a
lot of
runway they could just reduce how much
of a cash cow they were until they were
negative but once they reached the point
of the break even
or negative you said well it's done now
right
and then hedge funds started buying
newspaper chains
why
well
it's not entirely clear but hedge funds
are good at cutting costs where the
original owners maybe were
for emotional or personal
reasons or relationship reasons couldn't
do it
so the hedge fund will come in and say
i'm going to sell your building because
it's worth more than
you know your company so they'll sell
your building they'll sell you real
estate right and get cash out
but still
i feel like that's still not enough
financial reason to take over these
little
chains
i don't think that the hedge funds are
taking them over
just for money
and i'm going to put out a hypothesis
that even i'm not convinced about it but
here it is
i think uh billionaires
and big rich hedge fund owners
want to be in the game
and they know they have to own some
media to be in the game it could be that
owning a media
entity gets you
sort of a ticket to hang out with other
media moguls
could be that
it's just an expensive way to buy a
ticket to the show
if you're hanging out with the other
media moguls you really do kind of know
what's going on probably better than you
and i do and you maybe have some
influence
but
if you had enough newspaper chains
who reads newspapers in 2021 and 2022
old people right
do old people
buy a lot of products and therefore the
advertising in newspapers would be a
good business model
nope
old people who do not buy a bunch of
products and when they do it's the ones
i used to buy anyway they don't they're
not influenced by advertising the way
young people are
so
old people also vote at a higher
percentage than other people
so suppose you could control a newspaper
in a in a geographic area
and the only people you influenced were
old people
who vote
could you move an election that would be
otherwise close
just by having the old people consume
your
biased content
over and over i don't know
i i don't know
but i also don't know another reason
that the hedge funds would be buying
newspapers because i
you know i've got an mba and i can't see
how it makes sense economically
it's like something else is going on
just draw dude
solid career advice
all right i think it was babbling there
a little bit uh
so i i made a uh
prediction
ish
on twitter
that if uh the mississippi abortion case
tightens up uh
that it would be a turn the tide against
republicans that it would activate too
many democrats now i got pushback from
that
from a highly rational source some of
you know on twitter rich quote the
people's pundit uh barris
who goes by uh
people's peoples
with no apostrophe just peoples plural
underscore pundit and he's a good follow
so you should give him a follow but
anyway he pushed back on that he said
quote i'm highly skeptical of the
assertion that a
supreme court ruling against roe
would result in political blowback
favoring democrats and he goes through a
thread with a number of reasons which he
summarizes as
the the pro-choice designation um
doesn't mean what it used to be
uh
so people are a little more nuanced than
they used to be so it's not abortion
versus no abortion that even the people
who are
uh in favor of abortion are also in
favor of limiting it in ways that
other people would largely agree should
be limited you know not everybody but
so the argument is that there are not
enough
democrats who would care about this
topic because it either wouldn't affect
them personally
or it just doesn't look that different
from the current situation
what do you think or and then also that
the places it's likely to change would
be deep red states
so no difference
what do you think
uh and this will be a good test to see
if i've taught you anything have i
taught you anything
all right here's my take on it it goes
like this so this would be
adding to what i already said on twitter
since when do reasons matter
so
you know rich uh the people's pandemerus
gives very good reasons
so he gives data
that's fully in context and makes sense
to me
and he gives reasons
why a rational person could look at this
situation and say to themselves
that's not that big a deal
i'll worry about my economics and my
covet and you know nuclear war
but yeah
you know abortions just it's not going
to change that much
i'm not going to get pregnant
what do you think
all right here's my take
it doesn't matter what the reasons and
the data are it only matters what the
fake news machine
will do with it
and the fake news machine would use this
as jet fuel
they would use it as jet fuel
and they would say are you ready for it
how do you turn something that's no big
deal into a big deal
you say
it's part of a pattern
of republicans taking away bodily
autonomy from women
and then you're done
because as soon as you've made the point
and the fake news can simply make this
narrative stick
republicans here's another example
republicans are taking bodily autonomy
away from women
even if they only took a little bit
which you know i'm sure this
this ruling is about that
it doesn't matter how much autonomy was
taken from anybody
those would be the reasons and the facts
the reasons the facts will have nothing
to do with this
it will be can the fake news
get x number of democrats all riled up
about loss of bodily autonomy to the
evil republicans
oh yeah they can sell that
they can sell the out of that
it's just sort of it's sort of a perfect
emotional
you know fear-based
freedom-based
you know personal bodily integrity based
i mean it hits everything
just every part of your emotional
you know part of your brain
it just sets you on fire so and then now
factor in that most votes are not
movable
in a presidential election
the vast majority of people are going to
vote their team
regardless of policies or anything else
you're only talking about a narrow
sliver of people who determine the
election because they're the ones who
can change votes everybody else just
can't do it
so
if you move i don't know
five percent of
the public
to vote a different way than they would
or two percent
about two percent
would that change the national election
yeah i think it would so you only have
to get
you know a small percentage of people
riled up and this would do it
so
that doesn't mean it's enough of an
advantage that will change the outcome
but i do think it changes the bias
quite a bit
that's my take but it all depends on how
the fake news decides to
uh
frame it and i expect they'll frame it
in an anti-gop way
all right um
so ukraine looks like uh they're in a
little trouble
because russia has uh apparently amassed
a lot of military assets on the border
as if
preparing to attack
but at the very least
preparing to intimidate
and i guess uh tony blinken was over
there talking to his russian counterpart
and you know giving the old threatening
stuff etc and here's here's russia's big
complaint
that ukraine wants to be a nato country
how in the world
is that a good idea
is that a good idea
because you know the
self-defense of course makes sense and i
would be all in favor of self-defense
wherever wherever you can get it
but
putting nato on the border of russia
feels like an offensive move to me
am i wrong
does it doesn't the russian complaint
actually carry a little weight with you
it does with me
it feels like an offensive move
now
i wonder if trump would have done that
or did he try to do that i don't know
was trump open to ukraine being a nato
i'm looking at was he open to that
because if trump was open to it i think
i would have seen it as a negotiating
stick because you know what trump was
famous for and i would tell you this
often trump was famous for creating
something out of nothing and then using
it to negotiate
so it could be that the united states
thinks it's a terrible idea for ukraine
to be in nato exactly because it would
look like an offensive move but it might
be what we're looking to trade
might be what we're looking to
you know give to them in return for who
knows what you know nuclear deal
whatever
so
i'm gonna i'm gonna take this into the
future a little bit in my opinion it is
inevitable that russia and the united
states will be allies in the future
here's why
space
china is going to be a formidable power
in space
and
i don't think russia will be competitive
with them in the long run just because
of money you know china will just have
tons more money to do it right
i feel as if
and there's there's really no no chance
there won't be war in space
you know that right the odds of no war
in space are zero in the long run
there will be war in space
and
we kind of need to win that one
we don't have a choice
we can't lose that one
because that's that's the big one
you know all the wars terrestrial wars
none of them count
because the war in space will be the one
that determines who runs the earth and
anything else too
um
scott you realize that until spacex we
had to hitch rides on russian crafts
right
so russia i think knows that financially
the the best combination would be u.s
money plus you know russian experience
plus american experience to have some
kind of a counter to chinese
dominance of space
and i think we should just get over
ourselves on earth because none of it
matters
none of it matters we could fight all
day on earth
it won't matter in 20 years
it'll only matter who's shooting down
satellites and who has the you know the
high ground
and if we don't
remember
that
russia
historically has been more on our side
than against at least
i'm not the historian to tell you that
but certainly we've we've allied with
them before
um
so i think i think the frame here
is we should stop thinking about earth
if we think about earth the us is going
to you know try to get ukraine into nato
maybe
it's just going to get worse but if we
say hey russia why don't we start now to
change the frame
because if we don't start now we might
not be soon enough
so just change the frame to space
and tell russia it's not an option to be
at war with the united states
it just isn't
it is not
an option
that anybody wants
russia doesn't want it we don't want it
nobody else wants it i don't even think
china wants it
right
now you say putin has different goals
and anything he does is really going to
be a trick and he's going to try to
screw us at every turn etc well
you know that's how our allies are
i'm not sure any of our allies are
exactly doing what we want
it doesn't really work that way
and i'm pretty sure some of our allies
are spying on us and doing some to
us that we don't like
all right
that's what i think
and then the uh the harris uh vice
president harris continues to fall apart
story
uh jack bazabek seems to have a uh i
think it's a
scoop
and he says that simone sanders got
pushed out of the white house because
they blamed her for being the source
of cnn's kamala hippies
according to a white house staffer
um yeah you have to be careful about any
of the rumors coming out of the white
house
i think they have a pretty low chance of
being true
but
do you think simone sanders was behind a
hit piece on kamala harris
given that that was her own boss
know
it feels unlikely
it could be
that that she thought it wasn't going to
be hippies
so in that scenario i could see it being
her fault she might have thought that
cnn was such a friendly
that she could use it as a way to
rehabilitate kamala harris by the way i
just heard this fact can you fact just
fact check this for me
there was some kind of new uh
pr consultants
that were behind kamala harris doing
that uh
cringy
video where she was talking to the kids
who wanted to be in space camp but they
were actors
that was actually based on them trying
to improve their pr wasn't it
they bought it somehow they hired a
company
that thought using actors for kids to
make her look real was going to be a
good idea and some like we wouldn't
as if we wouldn't know that
she is the worst advised candidate of
all time
wouldn't you say
yeah dana aprino confirmed that that
maybe that's where i saw it i was
watching the five i think that's where i
heard it
um
all right
uh
yeah pr was was hired to help kamala's
image
kamala's image oh my god now i
i
i was reminded watching tucker carlson
as the jesse
smollette or smole i don't know i still
don't know how to
juicy i i still don't know how to
pronounce his name and i'm not doing it
intentionally
if you have a name that's intentionally
hard to produce pronounce don't blame
anybody else right
is it juicy
or are people just joking about that
anyway whatever it is
uh reminding ourselves how fake the fake
news can be
it's a good reminder that our news is
completely made up
so
um
and then i'm also seeing you know a lot
of push against uh p buddha judge
now i saw i've seen on
twitter a number of people
uh
mocking me for my
complimentary words
about
buddha judge
but let me put them in context in case
you've heard of anacontext
i didn't think he was the best choice
for president
i think he's very smart
and he has a good talent stack education
etc
and i think he's a
solid capable person i don't think he
necessarily did a good job as a mayor
i mean i don't know one way or the other
but doesn't sound good
and
you know you wouldn't be my first choice
for president but sooner or later we can
have a a gay president
and if it were him yeah maybe that'd be
okay
i'm all in favor of getting all the
firsts out of the way
just to get them behind us because i
think it helps i feel like the country
is better off for having had a black
president
i think we'd be better off if we get a
female president not because they're
better not because i want to be woke has
nothing to do with wokeness
it's just like a convenience
just to be able to say we did it you
know let's just say we did it
now not if they're not the best
candidate
of course
i'm not saying you should hire them for
their you know gayness or for their
their gender i'm not in favor of that
i'm just saying should we get one that
has all the qualifications yeah grinnell
for example
should we get one that is perfectly
qualified it'd be nice to get that over
with
just just put it behind us
you know
sort of a way to signify that we are
still the united states you know what i
mean
uh
uh this guy is controlled opposition
this guy you mean me
who's controlled opposition
some of you might be new to new to my
live streams so if you're new to the
live streams especially the people on
youtube here's what you need to know
i'm not the team player
right i'm not a team player i say good
and bad things about people on both
sides but i do it intentionally
you know i make sure i don't go too far
without saying something good
to somebody who's you know on a team
that
isn't playing well
all right um
what would suggest to you that he
all right i'm not gonna read that one
um
yeah that's true kamal harris was the
first female
uh
president for two hours right
all right um
that
is mainly what i had to talk about today
is there anything happening that i
missed
tell me in the comments what i miss
um
if this is a simulation then what is
different from the simulation creator's
reality or as a creator in the
simulation too
well if we're a simulation
i think it does prove that simulations
can create other simulations because we
will certainly do it and and video games
are simulations
so
uh
the the view of reality that works the
best for me
is
believing that it's a video game and
then i'm a player and some of the people
who are npcs now
i'm not i'm not saying that's reality
i'm saying that you can change your
frame to whatever you want and then see
if it predicts well
so i'm going to live in that frame for a
little while that i'm a simulated
creature in a simulated world
and here's one of the things that
predicts
are you ready for this
it predicts that you're working through
some kind of specific problems
for example
have i told you how many water leaks
i've had in my house in the past 12
months
like like just an incredible number and
they have nothing to do with any common
cause they're all just all over the
board different reasons
i had another one this week
um yesterday yeah yesterday
and
what causes that why would i have 10
water leaks and again it has nothing to
do with the building quality these are
these are all specific situations that i
i know the cause etc
it's not it's not poor materials it's
not poor workmanship
it's just coincidence
now
why do i have that coincidence because
there are also there are about five
others
that are themes that that hit me over
and over and over again that don't hit
other people ever
and then other people have a theme
that's over and over and over again and
doesn't hit me ever
how could that be
so it feels like we are either a b
testing for some higher
creature
and they put us in this reality to see
how we handle the situation that they
haven't been able to handle in their own
reality because that's how i'd use it
if i could build a simulation
that was so perfect to my own life
that i could a b test different
techniques i would do it wouldn't you
why wouldn't you
of course you would so if we're a
simulation you have to ask why it's
either a game
and you're sort of an avatar in a game
that would make sense it's just
entertainment or it's to learn something
which would mean they're testing
something
so if it seems to you that you're being
observed and maybe
you're part of an experiment which by
the way i felt all my life
probably age
9 or 10 or something
i first started thinking i was part of
an experiment with some higher level
creatures
and
and that's never gone away
i've had that my whole life
have i looked into the mandela effect i
have yes
uh i have not read the norm fictional
biography
i probably won't read anything if it's
fiction
um
all right
break free of consumerism did you know
that consumerism uh
was implanted in your minds by
people who said
correct me if i'm wrong so somebody
who's better at this watch the comments
somebody will give you a
correction but i think it was um
eisenhower who said what would be really
good for the country is if we were a
manufacturing country
and we would make things that we would
buy within the country and also sell to
other people
but in order to do that
yeah i think bernays was the name of the
guy who
was sort of the advertising
mind control expert edward bernays
and he convinced people that they needed
stuff
and we didn't we didn't we weren't like
that before
we didn't know we needed stuff
we thought we needed you know food and
stuff but we didn't know we needed stuff
shiny stuff good looking stuff
things to buy
and so once we became consumer crazy
and then also started getting jealous
about what our neighbors had so we had
to have that too
he created an economy that's based on
that psychology
you are actually programmed
now here's the part i've been waiting
for
do you want me to break your break your
brain
do you believe
that you could be programmed by an
external force
uh
to like something you don't like
and dislike something that you liked how
many of you believe that you could be
brainwashed to like something you don't
like
or to dislike something you do
easily
easily all right
let me give you a uh
do you think it could be done
with any kind of a
let's say
mechanical form you know it can be done
by suggestion
can it be done mechanically
like electrically
like actually directly programming your
brain
well
here's what i've been thinking about
lately
in terms of programming your brain so
it's like a whole different piece of
software not so much
but
suppose
you could you could combine
two parts of a brain
let's say one part controlled pleasure
because certainly there's parts of your
brain that control pleasure or the
sensation of pleasure
and then you take something that
somebody either didn't care about or
didn't like before
and you just create a
connection like a physical connection
between pleasure
and i'll just pick something
dirty socks
dirty socks
so every time you see dirty socks your
pleasure unit is automatically
stimulated because there's actually a
physical connection
could i make you like dirty socks
yep
instantly
so you don't have to program a whole
brain like you don't have to take this
big complicated brain
and and re rearrange all of it like you
would say if you updated software
you just have to take any two parts of
it that are intelligently selected
and connect them
now
could you do that
without
physically connecting them like having
some electrical or you know some kind of
beam into your head or a surgery or
something could you connect to
unconnected parts of the brain
so that something would give you
pleasure that never gave you pleasure
before
yes
yes
yes you could
and all you have to do is
uh give somebody pleasure and then
expose them to the thing
and then the brain will grow a
connection between them you will be
physically reprogrammed into liking
something you didn't like before
is it possible
yes i've done it to myself just to see
if i could do it
i don't know how many other trained
hypnotists do this but if you had any
idea
the things i've experimented with on my
own brain
that you know nobody will ever know
about
oh my god
yeah i have actually i've actually
trained my brain
to have pleasure for things that were
not even anything
it could be a random
thing
and also
a number of other things as well
so
could you program homosexuality i think
yes
i think yes
um
now uh but i have to be more careful
about that
so the question was could you turn
somebody who is
hetero uh make them gay by reprogramming
reprogramming
reprogramming them the answer is yes
same thing you would just have to
stimulate their pleasure zone
and connect it to that set of thoughts
or ideas and just continue
you just repeat it yeah
absolutely now
but could you make somebody who's gay
straight
with hypnosis
probably not
that's my that's my hunch probably not
because i don't
i think that would be a harder direction
because you know people who are straight
are always a little bit gay you know
what i mean you know what i mean
just a little bit gay
so they're at least a little bit leading
you know but i think if you're just
gay
that's that's a hard sell i mean
i maybe you could do it but
it'd be a harder task
um
you're babbling
yeah you're not wrong
you're not wrong
uh
all right some of your comments are
funnier than others
all right um
you can never program me to watch the
cnn yeah i could yeah i could program
you to watch cnn
easily
i just have to reframe it as
entertainment and you'd be watching it
all day i watch cnn for entertainment i
don't watch it for news and it is
it's literally entertaining
not in the way they intend
but usually i'm there oh my goodness are
they trying to sell that oh look what
they left out so i'm usually deeply
entertained when i watch cnn if i'm not
throwing up
uh
i do enjoy your company that's a good
observation
yeah i don't like to turn these live
streams off even when i'm done
because this one it's the highlight of
my day usually
um
now
how many of you
have discovered that the
simultaneous sip is a brainwashing
and
brain reprogramming
process now
i'm overt about that so i tell you
that's what i'm doing
but you can feel it right
how many of you
have developed
sort of an addiction
for the live stream and the simultaneous
step that it feels it feels like like an
actual
compulsion
in the comments how many have developed
that addiction
mild but an addiction
yeah look look at the answers going by
so if you're new to this
this is a demonstration of connecting
two things
so most people like their beverage
whatever beverage it is that they have
and if i if i
continually have you take a drink from
your favorite beverage and i pair it
with
this live stream
it does reprogram you
i'm doing it intentionally
but
it's i don't consider it immoral
because i'm telling you and it's for
your benefit so you'll you'll enjoy it
more
now that's the point right now it's good
for me because it you know binds my
audience to me but it should be good for
you because it makes you feel good
so in theory we both win and there's no
secrets i'm telling you i'm doing it and
you're feeling it in real time and by
the way if anybody feels
uh oh my god
you've programmed me and i can't escape
let me fix that
you can escape anytime you want
if anybody doesn't like that feeling
it's sort of a i hope it to be a benign
feeling that couldn't possibly hurt
anybody but if you don't like the
feeling
you have absolute full power
just stop doing it
now that's all you needed because if
somebody was feeling you know i
feel like it's out of my control well i
just put it back in your control
so you have full control
uh
even if it feels like you didn't now you
do
all right a few
somebody says
so he says
john says i escape every once in a while
to calm my mind
all right
now i'm going to turn off
youtube and i'm going to keep locals on
because i've been giving them a very
special
lesson on persuasion that you can't see
on youtube
because you're not ready for the truth
but
over on locals there already okay that's
it for now and i'll see you tomorrow
