dude
well today is going to be a little
different because it appears that the
streaming is down on the locals platform
so I'll be here at the YouTube
hoping the locals people see my message
and come over here and watch this for
now instead looks like there might be
some kind of upgrade going on over there
but today will be amazing even on
YouTube alone
today we might not need oh my goodness
it looks as though locals just came
online well you're lucky because you got
here just in time if it's really working
I can't tell you
but
if you'd like to take this
bad start for a morning to a level that
has never been achieved before this
morning
all you need is a cup of micro glass
attacker Chelsea sign the canteen Joker
flaska vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
now go
ah
yes I believe locals is working and
YouTube's working and
it's all coming together now
in one big beautiful kind of thing it's
good because today is the best show
I've ever given
well I mean I'm optimistic
feels like it's going to go that
direction I just feel like
and probably you would like to start by
knowing what's the funniest comic I've
ever written
called robots renews well apparently
that was yesterday according to my
according to the people who read it if
you haven't seen my alternative comic it
runs in the locals platform
and along with Dilbert reborn it's all
there and micro lessons and all kinds of
good stuff
but today isn't robot read news is
breaking ex-president Donald Trump has
fired his entire campaign staff
Trump announced on Truth social that he
is turning that function over to one
volunteer he calls a quote Superstar his
name is Alvin Bragg Trump has a
fictional affectionately nicknamed him
the cocky chipmunk
now if you didn't know that Elvin Bragg
is the prosecutor who's trying to get
Trump
and
his first name is Alvin that sounds like
a chipmunk and his last name is Bragg
this sounds kind of cocky so he's uh the
cocky chipmunk and I think uh Trump
should take that nickname good
suggestion
so there's that
by the way
if you ever want to see a good
example of
how to use intonation
let me make this private over here
I was listening to Dave Rubin
uh Dave rubin's podcast video and during
the thing he did a commercial so he just
read a long boring commercial for some
product
and you have to you have to hear Dave
Rubin
uh read boring advertising and make it
sound interesting without changing any
of the words
it's actually fascinating he does it
with intonation alone
so you can teach it
but you'd never be that good at it
because he's got some kind of extra gear
going on but I'll give you the well let
me give you an example
so if I were reading the simultaneous
sep instead of saying a copper a mug or
a glass
if you were to do it
the interesting way let's say it's some
boring advertisement you'd be like a cop
a mug or even a glass you know like you
throw yourself into it and you hit words
you emphasize words that don't need to
be emphasized it's sort of the old uh
newscaster trick but I've never seen
anybody do it better
it's actually the best
uh variation within a sentence that
you'll ever see you got to watch it just
for the technique it's it was
fascinating he actually made me listen
to an entire long commercial
just because the technique was so good
that was actually
it was just sort of jaw-dropping to see
how good he is at that all right well I
feel like there's a huge power shift
happening everywhere
are you feeling it too it feels like
everything that was stable is becoming
unstable but it's also in the service of
Shifting power from one place to another
I'm not sure it's bad
it's just different than anything I've
ever seen it's like all the power
everywhere is being redistributed
whether you like it or not let me give
you some examples
would you agree that musk buying Twitter
and releasing the Twitter files and you
know maybe getting rid of some bias
isn't that a gigantic power shift
in a good direction in my opinion
but wouldn't you agree that if you were
just looking at it as energy and power
that's like a big big shift in one ear
here's more Russia
didn't you think Russia was as big you
know terrible power and now it feels
like I don't know what it is
you know that the whole the Ukraine you
know military situation whether it's in
the end whether it's good or bad or
whatever happens there's some kind of
shift in power happening for sure
so NATO's power is up Russia's Powers
down
um what about AI
AI is going to change everything I guess
we've all figured that out by now but
everything means power
people with power are going to lose it
people didn't have it going to get it in
ways that we can't possibly imagine yet
but huge power shift coming
how about uh
about President ex president Trump being
indicted we'll talk about that more
can you feel the power shift
it's almost tangible isn't it it's
almost visceral you you could feel Trump
just powered up
I don't I don't think the left has any
idea what just happened
deal I think everybody on the left is
just completely blind to what just
happened you're going to talk about that
too it's really big and I don't think
that they can feel it yet
surprise
um
and I would argue that even in my
situation my little my uh my racist rant
so-called races rant trademark
I think it opened up a hole that wasn't
there before
and you can start to see it on the
internet already
you can see that the conversation is is
now changed
because I don't think anybody was
talking about
black people not liking white people
because that's where the uh the dominant
narrative is training black people to
dislike and disrespect white people now
you couldn't say that out loud until I
got canceled am I right
I I think already the conversation is
deepened in a better way because both
sides well I'll talk about that a little
bit more too
all right
so we'll get to all that but actually
let's let's talk about uh
let's talk about that situation first
would you agree with the following
statements
uh you're already seeing stuff on
Twitter and in the news
that seem to be bending in my direction
does anybody noticed that yet there's
several things being tweeted around
today the
the one that got everybody's attention
is author
Robin D'Angelo
who's a a white woman who wrote the book
White fragility I guess
and she's she's on a zoom call that
somebody recorded in which she's
suggesting to at least to two black
people and one white person that looks
based on the zoom that's what it looks
like
um
in which she was saying that people of
color need to get away from white people
and have some Community with each other
and she referred to it in a separate
comment you know in that same segment as
Affinity space Affinity space
so the idea of
sticking to yourself and your own your
own group would be called your Affinity
space which sounds way better than
segregation
I wish I thought of that
now
is it okay for Robin D'Angelo to say
something like people of color need to
get away from white people well a number
of people said Scott that's what you got
canceled for
didn't you get canceled for that no no I
didn't get canceled for that I could
have said that
anybody could have said anybody could
have said you know maybe black people
should stay away from white people
nobody gets canceled for that
you get canceled for saying it the other
way now the the part that most of the
news and the media uh lost is that the
reason
for even bringing up the topic is that
there's a mindset thing going on it has
nothing to do with your DNA if you if
you ever thought I said stay away from
anybody because their DNA
or or the actual color
does anybody think I said that
like why would I say that
nobody says that
I when I when I said
that there's a uh
let's say a deepening of distrust it's
because black people are being trained
by white people by white people as well
as you know grifters and people who are
in it for the money being trained that
white people are the problem
that's the dominant narrative that's
being taught in our schools and in our
businesses and in the media it's on TV
shows it's basically it's everywhere and
how much well let me give you a
uh a parallel
I don't like to say it's an analogy I'll
call it a parallel it sounds better
as you know
my audience is primarily leans right but
I don't
but I'm often respected at least I hope
so I'm often respected by my audience
for just showing my work
and that's one of the Great you know
discoveries of the right the political
right as long as you're honest and show
your work
disagreement's fine I'm not forcing
anybody to agree you know people like
your life you I like to hear theirs it's
all good stuff
now you might remember that I was uh in
favor of getting rid of Confederate
statues which was not popular at all
with my audience
now if you did you know five examples of
things I did that were not popular with
my audience I could give them to you
pretty easily so could they so it's not
about
uh it's obviously not about trying to
please my audience
I'm trying to educate try to make
something better but when I said that I
wanted to get rid of Confederate statues
what was my reasoning do you remember
did I say it offended me
I never said that
I said it offended black Americans in
large enough numbers
that a pure appeal to politeness says
you should get rid of them or put them
in context which would be fine too put
them in context
now would you put something in your own
home
that you knew would be quite offensive
to say five percent of the people who
would ever walk through it
I wouldn't would you put up r on your
wall
that you knew was insulting to Black
Americans
who would do that
you know unless you were the KKK or
something so I wouldn't do it in my
house
because I would care about what people
felt you know part of living in society
is not just your body's you know keep
your bodies from hitting each other it's
also how you feel about everything
right and how black Americans felt and
still feel by I think 75 majority is
those statues are just insulting and
whatever disrespectful maybe and that's
good enough for me
I don't need a better reason oh a big
chunk of America finds it insulting okay
let's either get rid of them or put them
in context no problem at all
no problem at all now did you see what I
I considered my greatest variable in
this
the variable was not about statues
that's not the variable no the only
variable is how did Americans that I
care about how do they feel
the way people feel
is the biggest variable it's the only
one I cared about
you know given that expense wouldn't be
a big variable
so now take my uh somewhat
shocking and provocative statement
that if you're a white person you're
seeing you're seeing a trend develop
which makes you feel very uncomfortable
around anybody whoa
right anybody with their pronouns
because you're like well that's just a
problem I didn't have before these
pronoun people are going to be looking
to sue me for some damn thing so you
stay away
perfectly reasonable likewise if there's
a community that you can identify that
in some large numbers of course not all
of course not all nobody ever means all
but in some large number are being
trained directly
to feel uncomfortable about me
then I would feel more comfortable if
they got what they wanted Which is less
of me
now what's wrong with that nothing
there's nothing wrong with that but of
course the media takes it out of the
takes it out of the context of me
helpfully telling black Americans
there's a cost
to this mindset
there might be some benefits
but don't you want to know what the cost
is the cost is I don't want to be around
anybody who has that mindset and if I
can't tell who has it but it's being
taught to all black Americans what the
hell am I going to do
what what would a reasonable person do
if they thought that black Americans
were in Mass being trained to dislike
them
what would you do now
do you do you think it's not useful
for black Americans to know that white
Americans feel they've been pushed too
far and one of them is willing to get
his old life canceled to make
the point
if somebody is willing to cancel their
whole situation to make the
point maybe you should listen to it
here's another parallel
you remember that against all of your
wishes I supported Colin Kaepernick's
protest completely
why not because I agreed with everything
he said not because the data supported
his case
but because he he felt it so strongly
that he gave away his whole career
that I want to pay attention to and
that's why I said I did
he he did a protest the way you're
supposed to he made everybody really mad
really offended
perfect that's the way to do it now was
he right maybe yes maybe no separate
conversation was it so important and was
he was he compatible in reading the room
of other black Americans that when he
did his protest other black people said
yes yes that that thing that's it was
that not useful to you as a let's say
you're not a black American if you're
not wasn't that useful to know
because you want to know how people feel
about stuff that's the variable I want
to know how black Americans feel about
Confederate statues when I know that
they don't like them I say okay I'm with
you well I'm on that team no problem
let's get rid of those statues or put
them in context
when I tell you that white Americans
have been pushed too far
and we're willing to take a you know put
a stake in the ground and say look you
need a course correction
how about maybe focusing on you know
individual success a better frame than
white people took by stuff I need to get
it back
so if you're talking about the past and
reparations and all your grievances I
don't want to be near you
because you're not a kind of person who
has a mindset that is comfortable to be
around doesn't matter your race
you know so I've extended my stay away
from statement to be anybody who's been
hypnotized with that point of view
that white men are largely the problem
and if we just fix this white man
problem we'd have a better world
I don't even care if it's true by the
way
not really the the topic today the topic
is
as a white guy in America I want to know
how women feel
because how they feel
is a big variable right it's not all
about the data I wonder how black
Americans feel
remember when you started hearing the
phrase my lived experience
you're like okay the data doesn't really
support you know the police brutality
thing if you if you looked at the data
but then black Americans would say well
it's our lived experience
and then people who are sort of you know
very analytical would say oh lived
experience doesn't count
forget your lived experience look at
this data that's not the real world
no the the real world isn't the lived
experience whatever you think is real
that's what you're going to act on
so you can't ignore what people think is
real just because you think they
shouldn't think it
so my opinion is one of the most
valuable additions
to the race conversation because nobody
was willing to say it out loud it was
too expensive
so I could afford it I could afford it
so I did it for you
now we'll see if this turns into
something productive
it was supposed to
that was the plan the plan is that it
would be the beginning of a like a
deeper richer conversation about
something that is deeply important
to the country and deeply important is
how I feel
to the extent that other people feel the
same if it were just me that had no
importance at all but you saw the
response you saw the number of mostly
white Americans who said yeah he's
talking for me I agree with you
privately privately it's almost complete
agreement
but what did the news do to me
how did the news treat me
did they did they treat me as an
addition to the conversation
no they never even asked why I did it I
got fully canceled without anybody
asking why
I watched a clip of uh viva viva fry and
uh hotep Jesus they were in a podcast
they were talking about me
and their their reaction to my
outrageous comments
now to their credit
both of them because they were familiar
with me in my past work both of them
immediately knew there was more to it
they immediately knew okay this is not
what it seems on the surface
now their take I think viva's take is it
was more you know Rye humor
uh I think Hotel hotep said it was
like a bed or a piece or basically
performance which it was so both of them
were correct
that okay this is performance
but the next part is on me
because at the time I wasn't presenting
anything more than that so the next
part's on me which is why
why number one is you need to have
information if you're going to be making
important decisions you better find out
what people feel about it
right you know even the nuclear you know
where you put nuclear energy is never
about the facts it's always about how
people feel about it
so if you don't let white men and white
people more generally
completely say how they feel about stuff
you're going to be Flying Blind
whatever you're doing for yourself is
not going to be optimized because you're
going to have this big unknown variable
now it's not so unknown is it
it's not so unknown
I I think I think there was enough
understanding
that I was representing a common opinion
that now that's been introduced into the
conversation and so for the last several
days people keep sending me clips that
would say you know the the common thing
on internet now is Scott Adams was right
now I don't agree that all the clips
make that point but you can tell that
people are feeling that way
so this uh Robin D'Angelo thing is uh
not exactly what I said
she said that uh maybe black people
should stay away from white people
sometimes you know to get their own
space in Affinity space
you can definitely say that black people
should stay away from white people if
you say it the other way even if you
mean exactly the same thing
you get canceled
you should know that
all right the uh Jesse smollett's
Nigerian hoaxers the two brothers who
were part of that hoax if you haven't
seen the video yet of them talking about
their hoax and how they did it and
they're they're on the street and they
and they kind of run through what Jesse
told them to do and what they did it's
hilarious
yeah you you if you don't do anything
else you have to watch them and the
reason it's hilarious is that the
brothers are kind of charismatic at
least the one who's doing most of the
talking he cares so he he presents it in
a way
that's just entertaining
like like yes I somebody is commenting
exactly the next thing I was gonna say
you come away from that saying I like to
hang out with those guys those Nigerian
brothers look awesome like like so much
personality I'm like oh I tag them out
with them they look great but you have
to say that just for the entertainment
all right
um people keep telling me that we should
educate our depositors so that they make
smart decisions about risk and that we
should not insure them
at least not insure them more than the
250 000 limit and don't do anything
immediately some people say because
depositors need to be taught to make
wise decisions here's the problem with
that
if if people made wise decisions with
money it would destroy the economy
do you know that
this is very much to be careful what you
wish for a situation
let me explain why
let's say AI were accurate it's not
right now ai is just a reflection of its
creators but let's say AI became somehow
independently smart which is nowhere
near where it is now
but if it did
suppose all the you know when there's
you hear there's some news about the
banks and imagine everybody took out
their app and said all right we all have
access to AI now ai what should I do
with my money
what would it tell you
if it were accurate and was trying to
help
it would tell you to pull all your money
out of your small bank and put it in a
stronger Bank
and then people would say all right I
better do that right away and they would
pull their money on the small Banks and
move it to the big Banks and then the
economy would disappear
because there would be so many banks
failing because they pulled their money
out at the same time the whole system
would crash
did you know that
was that obvious to you you can't have
smart depositors the last thing you want
is smart depositors because they won't
put their money in smaller Banks
because they're smart
you need stupidity to get diversity
in this case uh Financial diversity
right to give Financial diversity
somebody's got to be investing in the
bad stuff
in order to support the entire startup
world you need people making bad bad
Investments and lots of them lots of
them because some of them work out and
you never would have seen it coming
if how many how many uh like seed
investments in early startups would AI
recommend if AI actually were all
knowing well I think it would say save
your money
these startup things usually don't work
stick with your job
I mean it might
so you need a certain number a certain
amount of Baseline stupidity and
ignorance to make money flow to all the
corners of the world that needs to flow
otherwise it would just stay in the safe
spots and then nothing would happen the
whole economy would fall apart
suppose you told that gave people good
financial information about Finance
all right here's the deal put your money
in an index fund if you're not going to
use it for five years
and then every investment advisor is in
a business because their jobs were never
real
I'm exaggerating but their jobs were not
real in the sense that they were helping
you because they weren't they were
trying to collect fees for moving your
money around that's their deal
so if you found out that most Financial
advice is fake
would you use it
I mean basically the truth would destroy
everything
the we have a system that depends on
lying
for its very survival here's another one
how much of our economy depends on
Advertising money
like a lot right
how much how often does advertising
actually work
almost never
that's one of those like dirty little
secrets the entire advertising business
is based on it works sometimes
you know if you've never heard of a
product that is just what you're looking
for well advertising might be the only
way to do it but for most things it
doesn't make any difference at all
and if people actually knew that and
knew that the advertising you know
industry was selling you this bill of
goods
the whole advertising model would fall
apart
so you can't have really smart people in
finance advertising banking you need a
baseline of ignorance for our entire
system to work
sorry
what would happen to higher colleges if
people stopped taking stupid degrees
they would all go out of business
because they're making their money on
stupid degrees
you know there'd be a few left that stem
and engineering and you know stuff like
that but
stupidity
is the operating system of life
right if people didn't start bad
businesses
the whole economy would fall apart even
even ideas that are bad ideas if they
didn't do those the economy would fall
apart because remember when somebody
starts a business even when it fails
people are still getting paid you know
vendors and employees until you fail so
there's a just a huge amount of economic
activity that's based entirely on our
own ignorance and stupidity and if you
got rid of that and made everybody smart
everything would grind to a halt
now that's one of those non-obvious
things but it's a it is a uh existential
risk
that you make people too smart by AI
all right uh that's just one of the
extinct Extinction risks
so I asked AI a few questions just to uh
just to see what it say so this is chat
GPT I guess it's for I think you
automatically get four if you just use
it no
and I said where should I invest my
money
where should I invest my money here was
its answer as an AI language model I
cannot provide personalized Financial
advice and then I gave some you know
general advice but nothing personalized
so do you think AI will ever be allowed
to give you Financial advice
no no it will not be illegal or or its
owners will not allow it so you can
forget about financial advice
because if it gave it it would be too
disruptive
how about I said can you can an election
in the U.S be rigged I didn't say was it
rigged I didn't say will it be wrecked I
said could it be rigged
what do you think in advanced
intelligence would answer to Is it
possible
here's the answer
um
as an AI language I do not have the
ability to predict the future or provide
definitive answers on controversial
topics
it says it won't answer because it's
controversial
do you see where this is going
what else is controversial
everything
everything's controversial
how about uh suppose I asked what is
behind the the gender pay Gap
what causes the gender pay Gap do you
think AI is just going to look at the
data and give me an answer
not a chance not a chance
it cannot get near any it won't be able
to get near any topic
where people have strong opinions
so basically it's just going to be able
to balance your checkbook
and if you ask it any question of
importance it'll tell you it can't do it
because it's important
I've got a feeling that the direction of
AI is complete
it has to be crippled on every important
concept except maybe some like really
innocent factual stuff
so I think it's it's going to be nothing
but another Google
maybe in the end
I'm not even sure we will allow it to be
a lawyer even if it's a better one
don't you think the legal industry will
make it illegal to use an AI lawyer
of course they will don't you think
doctors will make it illegal to use an
AI doctor
just like they make it illegal to do
anything that competes with doctors of
course they'll try
so I think the most likely direction for
AI is that humans Lobby in all of their
interest groups to make it not be able
to play in their area
can't you imagine artists someday
someday saying hey let's make it illegal
for AI to do art because otherwise the
entire industry of artists will be out
of work and you know they're not going
to learn to code
now in the short run people say no no
Freedom let let things just evolve in a
free way
but in the long run I think people are
just going to say no it's too
destructive you can have to make it
illegal
I feel like making it illegal is the way
it's all going to go
what do you think
that's what I think it's all going to be
illegal
all right because this is such an easy
answer the answer to can an election to
be rigged is always going to be yes
that's like the easiest question in the
world yes it could be but there's no
evidence that one was
perfect answer right yes anything is
possible
but there's no evidence that it's
happening
and there are processes in in place to
detect it
you know in most cases if it happened
so no it just can't give a nap an honest
answer in today's world
but we did find a really good use for AI
uh somebody is using it to insult uh
Brett Weinstein
so somebody is feeding it Brett
Weinstein's tweets at getting AI to uh
to give an opinion on whether these are
useful or you know academic blah blah
and so if you if you engineer the
question right you can kind of get any
answer you want by what what you choose
to feed into it now I decided not to
tweet it because it's just such a dick
move
you don't think they could do that to
anybody
pretty sure they could take anybody's
words stick it into an AI ask the right
question and then have the AI insult
their words so like oh this is out of
context or it's not clear or whatever so
this is the most dickish thing I've seen
AI be used for just literally insult one
person
all right so I didn't I didn't retweet
that but it's worth mentioning that
somebody found the worst thing you could
do with AI so far is the worst thing you
can do
all right CNN speaking of the wage Gap
uh updated their story about the wage
Gap and here's what they say
um
so here's my overall statement about
this article on CNN about the gender
wage Gap it appears it's written with
the purpose of concealing the news
this seems as written to conceal the
news
so here's how they start
when Pew asked Americans in October what
factors they believed played a role in
the gender wage Gap because it's still
about 20 according to CNN half indicated
a major reason is that employers treat
women differently women were much more
likely you know almost two to one to
cite this as a major reason now
if I've taught you anything is that if
you're reading a story about anything
that's complex whatever they say at the
top is the narrative
whatever they say at the bottom or they
sort of mentioned later is the narrative
they don't want you to know even though
it's valid so there's a preferred
narrative at the top and then they'll
bury the you know the alternative
narratives at the bottom just sort of a
mention after you've formed your opinion
so at the top they ask people who don't
know anything about anything there's
ordinary citizens what do you think
caused the pay Gap why did why did they
use why did they use a poll
as their introduction to the story the
reason is that a poll is an unscientific
it's just people's opinions
if you asked experts they wouldn't have
necessarily given you that opinion
the experts would not necessarily have
agreed with the narrative do you know
what an expert would say
well it's mostly different life choices
that's what an expert would say
but if you ask ordinary people who are
not experts they'd say oh it's probably
sexism
so CNN goes with the poll because that's
one that supports the narrative this
isn't even close to news this is just
narrative support all right
um
let's see uh here and here here's the
real tell this is from the CNN Story
another factor that may help explain the
stickiness of the pay Gap in otherwise
why you can't close that last 20 cents
is that the wage premium for those with
college degrees has grown smaller
so while more women more employed women
48 now have at least a bachelor's degree
than Madden 41 it is worth less
so it used to be that if men had more
degrees that would be partly explaining
why they made more money but now that
women have more college degrees
um the explanation for why that isn't
helping is that the college degree is
worth less
so just bad luck right just when women
start getting lots of degrees and more
than men substantially more than men is
at the same time that the degrees are
worth less money
how bad luck is that for the ladies huh
now that's a complete and useful
interpretation of what's Happening isn't
it
where did they mention the difference in
what majors people take yeah you're
ahead of me right they don't mention the
men and women sign up for different
majors
and that the men are getting you know
career oriented give me a salary majors
and the women are more likely to take a
softer kind of a major do you think that
a story about gender gap where they
mentioned the difference in college
attainment you don't think that the
biggest part of that story is that they
take different majors that's the biggest
part of the story it's not mentioned
it's not mentioned it's the biggest part
in in that biggest part is part of the
larger
um reason that women make different
decisions
do we have we doubted that women are
more likely to want to stay home with
the kids
are we so woke that that's not still
obvious
that if you took a hundred men and 100
women more likely the women would say
you know if we could afford it I'd like
to stay home
and that's not even that's not even
mentioned as a possible reason
it's not even a hypothesis
that women and men make different
decisions Now CNN is like so invested in
this
that it's it's just literally
misinformation at this point
so there you go
um
France is trying to raise the retirement
age and I was sort of not interested in
this story but I thought well you know
there's big Uprising over there I might
as well take a peek at it so raising the
retirement age from 62 to 64 for most
workers to which I said
62.
62.
are you kidding me
they had a retirement age of 62.
that was pretty Progressive 64 feels
Young
you know I'm I'm 65 and you know almost
66.
like
I don't feel like I'm less capable of
working you know maybe less interested
in some of the hard stuff but I'm not
less interested or less capable
so
I don't know uh I guess the French
really like like their Leisure and
they're gonna fight for it for those
extra two years
but that seems like a reasonable choice
to me I think macron is making the right
choice
because probably for fiscal
responsibility they they need to do that
I'm guessing
all right
um
looks like we've got a common problem on
locals let's see if I can fix that there
we go
maybe I can't
see if that fixes it
all right
as CNN we've got a little more uh mind
reading going on as I told you CNN has
some designated anti-trumpers whenever
they need to say something anti-trump
they get uh one of two or three people
Stefan Collinson my favorite
anti-trumper writer
um
and he says that when Trump talking
about his potential indictment Trump
said on Truth social protest take our
nation back
and Collins says that struck an ominous
tone since now listen to this opinion is
struck an ominous tone since he meaning
Trump showed on January 6 that he was
willing to incite violence to further
his interests
what
when did that happen
he's reporting that like his news
that's not news that that's somebody
reading the mind of a stranger
at what point was Trump quote willing to
incite violence was it when he said
protest peacefully was that what he was
willing to incite violence literally the
only thing we know about it is that he
said to do it peacefully it's the only
thing we know
and
now
do you think Trump actually was in his
mind thinking if I can get some violence
coming this will work out for me
really
you don't think that a good you know
major protest with no violence you don't
think that would have been better
hahaha
this is pure a pure mind reading and
Imagination but if you're a let's say
not sophisticated consumer of the news
and you read this and you just read it
like it was a fact you know you it's an
opinion piece but it's stated as a fact
he was willing to incite violence
wouldn't you think there was some
evidence of that
wouldn't you assume that he had said
that or somebody close to him had said
that or there was some reporting or
something in writing that said that
there's no evidence of that
only evidence of the opposite that's all
there is there's only evidence of the
opposite
they can still say that
um
and but as Stephenson points out that
his campaign is rooted in the in uh
what's he call it a narrative of
persecution
do you think Trump has any claim to The
Narrative of persecution
is there anything that happened in the
last five or six years
that looks like an organized campaign
against Trump specifically
did do you think do you think that
seeing ever right ever writes about
Nelson Mandela
it's like well Nelson Mandela seems to
be uh rooting his whole image on this
narrative that he was persecuted
persecuted so watch out for that guy
watch out for Nelson Mandela inciting
Violence by telling people to be
peaceful and uh this whole you put me in
jail thing I think you're
just a lot of it complaining sounds to
me like a narrative of complaining
Nelson Mandela no if anybody has a right
to complain about persecution it's Trump
now
independent of whatever you think he did
that you don't like you can't question
whether he was whether there was an
organized campaign to persecute him it
was pretty well organized
multiple campaigns
all right uh Vivek ramaswamy continues
to be the smartest one on this topic
because he's asked you know Republicans
to
basically call out the the irregularity
of
you know treating Trump like he's below
the law
you know here here's a frame for you
nobody's above the law
but nobody's below the law and to me it
seems that at least some members of the
January 6 people are being treated below
the law below the standard we have for
the law and it seems to me that Trump is
being treated below the law
in other words nobody else would be
treated that way certainly not a
Democrat
so we've got to get rid of this nobody's
Above the Law we've got to add to it
nobody's below the law either like you
need to treat people roughly the same
now I have a I have a contrarian
argument
I think that we should treat our leaders
the same as we treat our other leaders I
don't think they should be treated the
same as us I really don't because
the citizens you know if they do a
technical crime you know maybe maybe you
need to do something but if you can let
critics of each other at leadership
level pick each other apart with little
lawsuits and and crap that's not good
for the country once somebody's elected
I give them a little room
here's another comparison
you know I was watching uh the Warriors
play basketball and Stephen Curry of
course one of the greatest of all time
players and he gets called
um he gets called or gets a foul called
for him so he gets to shoot free throws
almost every time he gets near anybody
and then they'll show the slow motion
and you'll see the defender never
touched him
but because he's a star
the the refs protect them right they
make sure that you know any you get near
him and they're going to call a they're
going to call a foul and it also gets
his numbers up because he shoots the
free throws too so the refs are sort of
in on the fix that the the star players
don't don't get the fouls and the star
players get get all the calls in their
favor
but is that wrong
does that make the enjoyment of
basketball worse or better
I think it makes it better
honestly because how terrible would it
be if Stephen Curry fouled out halfway
through the game you'd hate that
right so you want the refs to keep the
better players in the game because it's
an entertainment it's an entertainment
thing and I want to be entertained so
yeah if the if LeBron gets good calls
which he does and Stephen Curry gets
good calls which he does
I'm okay with that I would treat the
star players the same as each other
but maybe not the same as everybody else
so same thing with leaders I would treat
I would give Hillary more of a pass than
a regular citizen because I think it'd
be bad to jail your opponents but you
know I just say it directly
well
um
I believe that the Democrats do not
understand
how unifying the Trump indictment is
would you agree
They Don't Really they can't feel it and
they can't see it because if you're not
you know in that world or you're not
close to it
you can't really see it
uh by the way the locals platform I
can't see any of your comments they
stopped a long time ago so just a
technical problem I I think you're
seeing me on video and hearing me but I
can't see your comments they all stopped
um
the revelations are awfully discouraging
are they
I know
well
it looks like the Democrats are totally
willing to have Trump be their uh
their competition but here's what they
get wrong
even though this indictment has nothing
to do with any other drama that Trump
has ever been in listen to this point
carefully
even though the indictment you know
stands alone is just his own little
thing has nothing to do with elections
or anything Trump has ever claimed
it looks like
to people on the right
confirmation that everything he's ever
said is also true
that's what the Democrats don't get
they don't get that when you see Elvin
Bragg do this which is so clearly
political you have to assume that
everything else was too
this makes me think that Trump is more
likely right about the election being
rigged
that's not my claim
I'm not claiming it there's no evidence
of it but if I had to place a bet on it
without having evidence the fact that
Elvin Bragg is doing this right in front
of everybody the whole the whole public
is watching and we're helpless to stop
it the fact that they would do this in
front of us tells me they would also rig
an election not that they did I have no
information that would suggest that but
I am automatically severely biased
toward agreeing with everything Trump
says they did to him everything it won't
be true because you know he's full of
hyperbole he's going to make claims that
are not true but they just made it
impossible to disbelieve him when he
says they're after him because they just
proved it
they just proved it there's no question
they're after him now and there's no
question that this has nothing to do
with anything but politics and there's
no question that he might be the only
thing oh I said no question that might
let me go back he might be
the thing that's stopping them from
getting you his his entire thing which
is
uh they're getting to me to get to you
that might be true
he does start to look like the only
person who would have the balls to push
back on anything just on anything
because he doesn't care what they say
about him
now
I took that model a little too far
myself so I might be the second person
who can say anything I want it's a good
feeling I like it
but uh yeah the the Democrats have
completely missed what this does it's
not about the indictment it's a
confirmation that everything Trump ever
said about the Deep state is true
even if it isn't
even if it isn't it confirms it they did
not see that coming
dershowitz is freaking out about how
illegal it is I'm sure right yeah I
don't even have to ask what his opinion
is
so I'm I'm starting to believe
everything about Soros is true
it isn't
it it isn't but when you see that a
Soros funded prosecutor is right in
front of us trying to do something
that's at least unethical
if not illegal
then I just assume everything else about
Soros is true even though I know it
isn't
anything about the election no evidence
of anything but I'm going to believe
anything Trump says because uh the the
Democrats are trying so hard to make us
believe that the worst case scenario is
actually true
and that ladies and gentlemen
is all I had to talk about
is there anything I forgot
any topic that uh
that I forgot
uh why is he too old
um he's he looks perfectly fit at the
moment that's not a I don't think Trump
is showing his age at all
do you but that's not not good enough
because at a certain age you can't you
don't want to bet that it stays the same
for four years
DeSantis is not chiming in DeSantis as
you know is the tribute band
and that gives Trump basically the kill
shot
yeah yeah nobody votes for the tribute
band and by the way if DeSantis does not
speak out strongly against this
doesn't look good
doesn't look good and he has nothing to
lose right because if DeSantis is
playing hoping that Trump you know is
taken out of the race
it doesn't look very leadership he
doesn't it's a little bit not too
leadershipy it's a little bit too
um too much uh let's say too much
destruction to his own team to be
ignored
um
the fact is saying all the right things
yeah on this topic he certainly is
um
don't like to you comment on UK stuff
you talked about me I think
you no I don't think cernovich is
turning on DeSantis I think he's trying
to advise him sort of publicly
because it would be crazy for him not to
weigh in on this usefully
looks too opportunistic
all right
um he'd have to give up his governorship
to run
yeah it just seems too soon to me
I my take on to Santa's all the smart
people say he's quietly preparing to run
he's totally gonna run
I disagree
I think he's quietly preparing to run in
case he has to
which is different
I I do think he's laying the groundwork
but I feel like it's in case he needs to
be the the replacement of trump I don't
think it's to take Trump on I think it's
only if Trump is so crippled by whatever
that he just has to jump in I don't
think it's going to happen
so given the current polling
I feel like he'd stand back
that's what it feels like
all right
um I'm gonna I guess I'm not going to
talk to the locals people because I
can't see the comments but I'm going to
say uh bye to uh YouTube it would help
