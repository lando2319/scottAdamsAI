Wake up sleepy heads I know it's a
Sunday and you like to sleep in but how
in the world are you going to watch this
live if you're asleep
well if you'd like to take this
experience which is the best thing
that's ever happened to you up to levels
which nobody can even imagine all you
need is a cup of mug or a glass a tanker
chalices die the canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine for the day
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it's
gonna happen now go
ah
we all feel better now
well I'd like to introduce the theme for
today's show
the theme is
you have to learn the two on the nose
filter for identifying fake news
now I talk about this all the time but
I'm going to put the current stories
into that filter and see what it tells
us now the two on the nose Filter Works
like this
you hear a story in the news and you say
to yourself my God my hair is on fire
because that thing in the news
if your first reaction is that is
exactly
excuse me that is exactly what I thought
the other side was doing
it's almost certainly not true
because in the real world things are
messy you know things are well it's a
little bit like this but a little bit
like that and a little bit like the
third thing
rarely ever
does the news serve up a perfect story
that just fits the narrative
if it fits the narrative and there's no
rough edges
that's called two on the nose two
suspiciously perfect
now there's an actual Theory
for why that's true so it's not just a
random observation you know anecdotal
there there's a working theory behind
why
and the why is that the thing that makes
something news in other words the only
reason you heard about it is that it
caught your hair on fire and when when
people saw this story
real or not real they said ah my hair is
on fire I can't believe it those stories
are almost never real
almost never let me give you an example
uh what was it the uh
Russians having a bounty on American
soldiers in Afghanistan
a little too perfect and that and that
Trump didn't do anything to push back
against that because he was a Russian
colluder
a little little too neat right nice neat
little package don't know who the source
is
so you should have been able to identify
that as fake
from the first moment it had all of the
Tells for a fake story
now
that we've got a little uh distance
a little bit of distance from Russia
collusion
what do you think about people who have
believed from the start they believed
that Donald Trump was literally
colluding with Putin
just think about that from you know the
the distance that we have from the story
now
just imagine that
40 percent or half of the country or
something like that believed it from the
start
from the start and believed it all the
way through until it was you know
debunked
there's no way that was true
you didn't even have to do any research
that one was
two on the nose
that had made up fake news all over it
from the first minute
all right here's another one
the president of the United States stood
in front of the public
and with Advanced planning and full
knowledge of what he was doing
called neo-nazis Fine people
if you ever believe that actually
happened in the real world
you don't know the two on the nose rule
because they were trying to paint Trump
as a racist and then whoa look he did
according to them he did exactly exactly
the thing that a racist would do
except it didn't actually happen in the
real world
how about the part where Trump doesn't
understand science or or medicine
oh and then he recommends injecting
bleach or or some kind of disinfectant
into your body
from the first moment you should have
known that didn't happen
and it didn't now you say to me but
Scott I saw the video myself I saw him
say it no you didn't you really did not
because it doesn't exist
there's a fake there's a fake edit that
makes it look like it exists but it lops
off the clarifiers in the front and the
back
so both both those both of those stories
are rupars things that look true if you
see the Covington kids at it but are
obviously not true if you see the full
full story
uh how about the uh the Kraken
about that story about the Venezuelan
General and
do you remember I called that
from the first moment
but keep in mind I wanted it to be true
in a sense I kind of wanted it to be
true now if you can call on
something while wanting it to be true
then you're using the two on the no two
on the news rule correctly right the two
on the nose rule is not just for things
you don't want to be true
it also applies to your side right the
stuff that you think is true
so here's one
um Target stores is targeting kids with
satanic
um satanic imagery
true or false
well apparently there's some element of
truth to it there's a company that makes
that kind of stuff and there's some
clothing in the store
but today I saw a compilation video
of allegedly the clothing that they're
selling to children
now I I don't know the fact Jack
but when I saw the examples that they
seemed obviously not real
to me to me they look obviously too on
the nose
it's an actual satanic image in the
child's clothing in the store
no I do not doubt that satanic imagery
has worked its way into the mainstream
because that wouldn't even be unusual
would it
I mean yeah there were there was a long
period when Nazi imagery was on stuff
and I mean you know uh Jay Guevara is on
clothing so it's not unusual that
clothing styles would
promote some horrible element of society
so that's not the two on the nose you
have to see the pictures themselves so
just to be clear
I'm not saying that there's no satanic
imagery in Target I'm not saying that
I'm saying that the the compilation
video that went around couldn't possibly
be true it's just too way too on the
news
all right
uh but if I'm wrong about that you will
let me know
all right I see the comments you keep
telling me there's a simulation
um
there's a simulation coincidence
that is a funny one now remember I'm
pro-lgbtq I know my audience May
disagree with me on some of those issues
but this is just a weird coincidence
that it's pride month coming up in June
pride month
and somebody pointed out on a meme that
if if you connect pride and month
you know together as one word
the middle of it would spell demon
because Pride ends with d e and month
ends with m-o-n or month starts with
m-o-n
now
that's just a coincidence right it's not
telling you anything but that's kind of
weird
that that's a little too on the nose too
yeah that's a little bible Cody
if you think that means something like
it's really a hidden message that
something demonic is happening that
would be a little too on the nose
that would be two on the nose yeah I
think it's a coincidence pretty sure
it's coincidence
well here's another indication of how
much the media can control your minds
there was a Russian survey of Russian
public
and Putin still has you know support
there but he has a lot more male support
than female
um I don't know what that means
why do you think Putin would have more
male support than a female
is that just because he's doing manly
things and they like it because he's
strong
and the women are referring for their
sons but the men are like oh let's take
off our shirts and fight bears something
like that that probably explains it the
machismo part all right but uh here's
the interesting part about that among
those Russian public people who receive
information from television
um
they were the most uh supportive of the
Putin 39 percent
or was it the War uh
uh Putin and uh
the people who supported in the least
are the ones who read the telegram
channels
so the telegram channels would be
messages that are not from Putin's
control and television in Russia would
be under Putin's control so you can see
the difference 39 percent
uh he can control 39 of the people if
they're watching television but he can
only control 23 percent if they're not
watching television and they're using a
different source
now
have I told you a million times that
people don't don't make up their own
decisions
they don't decide on politics their
opinions are assigned to them your
opinion is assigned to you not from
necessarily a person
or some you know cabal but by the
channel that you choose to watch
so if you chose to only look at the
telegram channels
you would end up assigning yourself an
opinion that matched that and if you
only watch television and you never
watched telegram you would end up being
assigned opinion that came from
television it's very clear
that our opinions are assigned
and it's just based on what Channel you
decide to look at
um although there's a little you know
causation maybe backwards it could be
that because you believe a certain truth
you spend more time looking at a channel
that agrees with you so it can work both
ways
all right
um
let's see what else is going on here
we now know that uh the money collected
by black lives matter
uh only only one third of it went to
organizations that make the world worse
and two-thirds of it was uh
either spent by the people who collected
it or
disappeared or or just didn't get spent
or or something now
how many of you from the beginning
thought that black lives matter was a
totally
legitimate organization dedicated to the
betterment of black Americans
what you didn't believe her from the
start
it seemed did it seem a little
opportunistic
yeah yeah
um
I can tell you that I heard early on
from a good source that it was not
legitimate I heard it from an Insider
early on
so I guess I was there a long time
before everybody else I couldn't say it
in public you know before I was canceled
I couldn't I couldn't actually say it
out loud because it was too dangerous
but now I can say it yeah from the
beginning I was informed that it was a
fake money making you know organization
and was not dedicated to fixing anything
so but I couldn't say it but I could say
it now
um
I would like to give my
uh
I like to suggest
that if I were the lawyer for Derek
Chauvin the Chauvin the cop who is a
convicted for uh allegedly killing
George Floyd
I was trying to figure out how I would
have done a better job
and here's how I would have done a
better job
I think this would work I'd have to test
it first
all right
um
so officer Chavin was around five foot
eight and 140 pounds ish
and George Floyd was probably over 200
pounds and
um well over six foot however big it was
so let's say that uh roughly speaking
let's say that
George Floyd was 50 percent bigger
yeah they'll say it was 50 bigger than
Chauvin just rounded off
so I would say if I were the attorney in
my closing statements here's how I would
deliver my closing statements now I'm
not a lawyer so this might not be
allowed if I if I couldn't do this in my
closing statements I I'd work it into
the trial somehow
but I would I would say all right let's
uh let's do a demonstration I don't have
anybody here who is over six foot tall
and weighs over you know 200 pounds so
I'm going to use myself just for safety
I'll use myself as George Floyd
but I'm only five foot eight and I'm I
only weigh you know 150 pounds
so I'm gonna have lean I'm gonna have
I'm going to give you my closing
arguments
with somebody kneeling on my back
who is roughly the same ratio of weight
as Sheldon was to Floyd
so in my case that would be let's say a
10 year old girl
so I'd have let's say a 10 year old boy
or girl who weighed 70 pounds a dish
leading with one knee on my back and
then I would have my fellow judges you
know usually have some assistance I'd
have them hold my arms and legs
so that I couldn't move and then laying
on my stomach with the 10 year old boy
or girl's knee on my back just one knee
not both knees just one knee I would
deliver my closing argument
and I would make it last in 30 minutes
and I would speak clearly and fluently
for 30 minutes while under the deadly
attack
that killed George Floyd
and then I would say ladies and
gentlemen
I rest my case
and then the little girl or little boy
would be uh would be trained to ask me
immediately after I rested my case
should I get off your back now
and that I would say after I've rested
my case but they're still listening I'd
say yeah but take your time
take your time
do you think I couldn't have won that
do you think do you think that I could
not have won that uh case of course I
could
that was the most winnable case I feel
like whoever was his lawyer maybe wasn't
trying as hard as they could have
no way to know but based on the result I
have to think maybe somebody didn't try
as hard as they could have
because I'm pretty sure I could have won
that one and I'm not even a lawyer
all right uh
so I guess the Attorney General in Texas
got impeached or he's being impeached uh
Ken Paxton
and here's the interesting thing
uh the Republicans he's a Republican and
he was a well-known Republican you know
for an attorney general he's somebody's
name I've heard for a while
so he was prominent
and the Republicans just took him out
good for you
Republicans just took him out they just
voted to impeach him now not all the
Republicans right I think Trump is still
backing him for example
but his his offenses were bad enough
uh essentially he's being accused of
special favors to a donor and the
special favors look pretty bad
if the allegations are true
he really did need to be impeached no
doubt about it so here's what I like
about the story
Republicans have
sort of made a brand for themselves
that if needed they will impeach their
own president
because they correct me if I'm wrong but
Nixon got impeached with Republican
votes not all of them but Republicans
will Republicans will clean out their
own closet
and there isn't you know some belief
that the Democrats won't
that there's nothing a Democrat could do
that would ever get Democrats to break
Rank and and impeach them
now I'd like to think that's not true
I'd like to think that if the case were
as clear as this can Paxton situation
looks that they would also Act
but it does kind of look like the Joe
Biden Hunter Biden situation is just as
clear as the Ken Paxton situation
and
if you were a republican this is a good
day for you it feels like a bad day
doesn't it because a prominent
Republican is being impeached that's bad
but honestly I've never respected
Republicans more
than today
that's actually true that's like a
literal statement sounds like hyperbole
no that's actually literally true the
fact that the Republicans took him out
that gives me respect I respect that
because that's
that's why I heard him right so yes you
can be unhappy that the Republicans
essentially hired a guy by voting for
him that turns out to be a problem
that's not good but I've told you before
that you should judge people by how they
correct their mistakes not by whether
they make them if you judge people by
making mistakes then we all suck because
everybody makes mistakes but we don't
all handle our mistakes the same way
that's where you really find out who you
are and the Republicans have handled
their mistake it looks like so good for
them
if if things go the way it looks like
it'll go
I'd also hasten to say that Paxton is
innocent until proven guilty
he's innocent till proven guilty
but there are some pretty bad
allegations
um
well here is a big surprise I I don't
know who saw this coming but can you
believe that at the last minute the
Congress made a debt ceiling deal
I mean who saw that coming
everybody who's ever paid attention saw
that coming right yeah so
you know I've been explaining to you or
really
explaining myself for a few weeks you
know why am I not talking about the debt
ceiling negotiation it's the end of the
world and I kept saying
there's nothing to talk about until the
last 10 minutes the entire story is the
last 10 minutes there's no story until
the last 10 minutes
so everybody was saying talk about the
story and I kept saying there is no
story there's nothing to talk about
until the last 10 minutes because the
last 10 minutes you know not literally
10 minutes but the the last 10 minutes
or so is when both sides look at their
most recent polling
and they know who's in the weaker
position
and then the weaker position has to give
something up and then you get a deal
because the the last thing anybody wants
is to not have a deal
so just as it should have gone this last
minute we don't know all the details
um there's something in there about uh
student loans
but I don't think we know the details of
that
so we'll wait to judge whether it's a
good or bad deal well no I take it back
we don't have to wait to know if it's a
good or bad deal am I right
it's a bad deal
[Laughter]
the reason that you can reach a deal at
all is because both sides accepted less
than they wanted right
so
somebody says No Deal
they haven't turned it down since I
started talking are they
I I think it's looking like a deal but I
wouldn't be surprised
if there's a last one minute twist right
so the last 10 minutes is when you get
the verbal agreement
but then the last one minute somebody
like Matt Gates might might emerge and
say ah now you only got one minute and
it looks like the polling would be bad
for Democrats
one minute to go oh well Leo I'd sure
like to give you to give me this thing
no we don't want to give you this thing
we already negotiated the negotiations
over oh is it is it well let's wait for
a minute and see how you feel no damn it
all right you can have it so
it might be that there's still that last
minute one minute flurry but it's still
going to get done
it still will get done
all right uh are you following this
drama with the Babylon bee
of of all things to have a drama
so the founder uh I guess is would be
the CEO Seth Dillon
he fired one of his writers on Twitter
so that the guy tweeted a profanity at
so I'm uh it was a Christina
pushar or somebody so some Republican
person I guess
so he
so one of the people race for the bee
and had that in this bio tweeted a
profanity which Seth Dillon saw and
basically fired him in public on Twitter
now you might say to yourself well good
for him you know he's he's got a
standard and he's
you know keeping up his standard
but the embarrassing part is that Seth
Dillon who fired his guy for
saying what he said in 2020 he had
tweeted if you're afraid you might get
fired for speaking your mind the
solution is to speak your mind anyway if
no one is willing to take that risk
nothing is going to change
and so that his own writer spoke his
mind and they got fired
now
to support Seth Dillon you know I want
to make sure his side is represented he
didn't say that that person shouldn't be
fired he said the opposite he said
you're going to get fired if you use
Free Speech you're gonna get fired but
do it anyway
so his writer did it anyway
it got fired
now I'm not even sure if there's any
you know any big crime here
because the reason he got fired is that
he wasn't representing the company the
way they wanted to be represented
everybody has that right right that's
the employer's choice
so
um I don't know there's not much of a
story there I guess the big story is
that it happened on Twitter instead of
happening privately
but either way I got a lot of publicity
for the B
we'll see what happens there
all right I saw so now that the uh I
think all of the Republican candidates
for president
um
are in favor of using the U.S military
to go after the cartels
now
the pushback I see in this
isn't good
meaning that it's not well thought out
so let's give you a little detail when
people say they'll use the military to
attack the cartels you have to
understand that nobody's in favor of
attacking the military of Mexico
you all know that right nobody's going
to try to take over their Capitol
building
the only way we would use the military
in Mexico is if we told them to get out
of the way
we'd say look we've identified these
operations just make sure you don't have
any civilians or military people there
and we'll take care of it and then
Mexico will say hey we're a sovereign
country that would be an active War you
can't you can't use any military in our
country because we would have to treat
that as an act of War
then what would we do
well in the past we would say oh I guess
we can't do that
but there are six Republicans who said
we're going to do it anyway
we're not asking for permission we're
warning you to get out of the way
and to me that's the only way to play it
because you'd want you'd want the
Mexican Government to have the cover
that they didn't have a choice
right because I think the Mexican public
would understand
I think they would totally understand oh
our government was not given the option
and we understand why it happened
I feel like we wouldn't even have much
of a public problem in Mexico
now would innocent people get killed
probably
but we could give warning on any
locations and people I mean we can say
we can give them plenty of warnings
here's our Target list if you're
anywhere within you know 100 yards of
these people there's going to be some
blowing up happening
right I wouldn't I wouldn't be within
100 yards of any of the people on this
list and I wouldn't be within one mile
of any of these facilities
and just give them give them the hit
list
then you negotiate with the cartels
I wouldn't fire a single bullet
until I gave them their target list
told them exactly what's going to happen
told Mexico it doesn't matter what they
think about this idea
and then I would ask for the heads of
the cartels to contact me and I would
start talking to them because there
might there might be a way to you know
work something out
I'll tell you my rose-colored glasses
perfect world
I don't think it's possible
but I like to think about it make a deal
to the heads of the cartels or even
maybe just one the strongest one
and you say we are desirous
of moving a lot of manufacturing out of
China
and into something closer
like Mexico
if you give up the drug trade
and you know Help Us close it down we'll
give you equity in the in some of the
build up but you have to be a
contributing partner in other words you
have to let's say turn your your
military into a security Force
or somehow you have to contribute in
some legal way
and it might be just to reduce the
amount of crime so that the people who
want to work at these companies are safe
and I would say this will be your one
and only chance
to allow your children to have a good
life with money and with reputation
going forward if you say no to this
offer where we'll try to turn you into
some legal entity
we will kill all of you
and you'll never get this offer again
I'd try it
now like you say if you put the cartel
in charge of security
the security people will be the ones
robbing stuff
I get it
I get it I just think there might be
some way there might be some way to give
them some sense of ownership
without giving them control of doing
anything illegal
Maybe
remember every every action you do down
there is going to be sub-optimal there
there's nothing you could do where it
just works and there's no downside so
everything you do has got a big risk
no exceptions
yeah well like okay that's a good
example the Hell's Angels
were sometimes hired to do security at
uh Rock shows
but that can go bad really quickly that
can go bad really quickly like out yeah
Altamonte
however
imagine this imagine if the cartels you
know were part of the security Force
but there was somebody not some
non-cartel well everybody becomes the
cartel eventually
I don't know I'll have to think about it
a little more but I think there's
probably some long shot way to
turn the cartels into a positive force
now the reason I say that is you you
remember that early America
was dominated by robber barons
they were the cartel of their time
America had its own cartel the
billionaire well millionaire robber
barons you know the built the
Transcontinental Railroad and all that
they were bad dudes
they were bad bad people really bad
people do you think they killed people
probably
probably yeah or worked them to death
had slaves working on the railroad yeah
yep all that but if you looked at those
family names today
that they all made so much money that
they could they had the luxury of doing
legal things eventually
so yeah they they became legitimate you
know
um
philanthropists and stuff like that
all right I know that stuff because I
used to work at Crocker National Bank
and Crocker was one of the robber barons
and whenever I worked for the bank it
was just the weirdest thing
because the bank itself was really
really honest
it was a bank Wells Fargo bought them
eventually now Banks do some some
sketchy stuff but we're not talking
cartel Robber Baron level stuff you know
it's more administrative Weasley stuff
but we have an example of effectively
the American cartel was legalized and
you know brought into the fold
um all right here's a I don't know if
this is a trend
there's something called so log to me
the first part is solo meeting women
marrying themselves literally having a
wedding
and having a wedding ceremony in which
they celebrate their self-love
you can use your imagination of what
that honeymoon looks like
I think I'll take a moment to imagine it
yeah oh yeah
all right I'm done
um
and I this looks like more of a just a
funny story as opposed to a big old
Trend but there are CNN found several
people to talk to who had done just this
now what you would think is an unrelated
story but
maybe not
uh there's that big question of what has
caused a continuous drop in
testosterone and also sperm levels in
men
over over recent years well it's been
happening for a long time but just gets
worse every year
and here's the thing that nobody
mentions
right now in my opinion the the most
logical
um
culprit is either diet
big Pharma
lifestyle you know everything from not
getting enough sleep to looking at
screens I see somebody saying plastic
but I'll generalize plastic to
environmental pollution
all right so I don't know about plastic
in particular but I will say that
pollution almost certainly has some
effect you know because you can imagine
it would degrade your overall health
yeah maybe it's soy I don't know
something about the food quality but the
one thing that nobody says out loud
because they're not as canceled as I am
I'm canceled enough to say this
we know for sure that men's testosterone
drops when they're around children you
know that right unless they're petos I
guess if you're like a you know an
average person average male and you
spend time around children your
testosterone just drops immediately
probably your sperm production
probably
it makes sense so we know that men are
very influenced by the environment
now if a man wins a competition
science says their testosterone goes up
because they won if they lose it goes
down
now what do you think happens to a man's
sperm production and testosterone when
he's around a woman who he's attracted
to
do you imagine it goes up
I mean if it goes down when you're
around kids because that's sort of a
damper on all that
I would imagine that if he's around an
attractive woman who shows interest in
him
I would imagine that would go up
now look at feminism
feminism and I'm not going to say that
it's bad or good I'm just going to
describe it right so this is not a
criticism just an observation
the point of feminism
see if this framing is is wrong the
point of feminism is that women in
general
wanted to move from a place where they
were presenting themselves as men wanted
them to present themselves
to presenting themselves as women wanted
to present themselves
is that wrong
would you say that frame is accurate
that it was more about less about giving
men what they wanted
and I'm not saying that's good or bad
it's a free world
and more about what women wanted
which is a little different
now what would be the logical outcome of
that
The Logical outcome of women putting
less effort into making men
want them and more effort into making
men irrelevant
how would men respond biologically and
physically well it should knock the hell
out of your testosterone and I would
imagine your sperm production follows
along with that
because if you see somebody you don't
want to mate with
does your sperm Productions go up
and and
yeah
so it's one of the things that nobody
can mention right
now what about birth control
I think women's birth control is one of
the reasons that men's sperm production
went down
just a hypothesis but it's a pretty good
one
because I believe that birth control
makes women less attractive to men
I think the science supports that and
then it would have the same impact
now everybody's different so that
doesn't mean any individual is having
any of these effects but just an average
now
like I said I still think the most the
biggest impact is probably the food
supply and we're getting fat and
unhealthy
um but I would I don't know why we can't
say that out loud why can't we say out
loud
I'm perfectly in favor of women pursuing
their own happiness they could call it
feminism or anything else it's a free
country and adults can do what they want
be they hetero or be they not
right so
I don't know I think we ought to be able
to talk about it
all right uh the there's a health club
chain called Equinox
and there's a story about them firing
they fired a black woman who had been
late uh 47 times in 10 months
she sued them for racial discrimination
and she won 11.25 million in Damages
and
but
Twitter contacts notes added some
context and it said that the re hold on
hold on there's context to this the
reason she won is because there were
lots of examples of white employees who
are also late a lot and did not get the
same treatment
so therefore she won
now since we were not on the trial and
we were not privy to all of the evidence
of the trial I don't think we can second
guess it
because if you ask me that's a pretty
good defense
if it turned out that there were a
comparable late white employees and no
repercussions
pretty good pretty good case
however I would like to point out the
following
let's say Equinox hired 10 employees
and all 10 of them were late all the
time
nine of them were white just for a
mental experiment here one of them is
black
which one gives them the most risk
10 people they're all late the same
amount nine of them are white one of
them is black
well if you were to if you chose to fire
first any one of the white people
do you think you would be fired for
racial discrimination if the first one
you fired was white
no nobody would even think of it
but if the first one you decide to fire
was black
what are your odds of being sued for and
losing 11.25 million dollars
very high
very high
so the company loses the ability
if they thought that the one employee
was really worse than the others and
that's where they wanted to start you
know perhaps they were going to fire
some of those other people too maybe
they were going to make a an example out
of one of them
and hope that that caused the rest of
them to be more on time don't know what
they were thinking
but you cannot look at these situations
as equal risk
this is not equal risk that company had
a much bigger risk with that one black
employee than they did with all of the
white employees who apparently were
terrible as well they hired a lot of
terrible employees apparently
which is not that strange for that kind
of business
right now here's my provocative question
do you think Equinox will get more sign
ups or fewer
because we saw Bud Light we saw Target
they lost 30 billion collectively in in
equity
because conservatives said we're going
to act on that
do you think conservatives are going to
read this story and say I'm going to
join Equinox
just just as an Fu to the system
not not necessarily because I think you
know it's going to be a Bastion of white
people or something like that but rather
just to support them
because it doesn't look like on the
surface
that this was necessarily a fair result
because somebody had to get fired first
and I do I do understand there's it's a
little bit sketchy it's a little bit
suspicious
that the black employee got fired first
but that's how coincidence works
whichever one of them got fired first if
somebody was going to get fired
um it was going to be somebody
so
we don't know exactly what happened but
the real question is will conservatives
interpret this situation as a reason to
sign up for equinox what was your
feeling as I told you about the story
did you have any feeling like oh shoot
I think I want to support that company
or or is it just no it's just a story
about a company
all right so it looks like it produces
no the story produces no energy right
yeah none of you are interested in
supporting Equinox I see
all right
good to know good to know
all right
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
is my prepared comments on this
Sunday that's going to be a kind of a
sleepy Sunday
if you're wondering what topics are in
the Dilbert reborn comic that you can't
see unless you're a subscriber to locals
or you could subscribe to it now on
Twitter and for a lower cost you could
just deliver comic only
um
so Dilbert of course is dealing with his
you got an AI sex bot
but he ordered the Karen 3000 that
didn't work out
um
we also have uh the character Dave Dave
the engineer Now Dave the engineer is a
new character he's black and he's an
engineer who works at Dilbert's company
and his character is that he's a
prankster
so whatever he's talking about the woke
stuff he's usually joking to make people
uncomfortable
uh but the pointy air boss will put Dave
in Charge of their Dei program
so if you want to see Dave the engineer
in charge of Dilbert's Dei
and let's just say that Dave being a
prankster
his idea of how to increase diversity
is not what that boss had in mind so
that's your teaser
uh also in Dilbert upcoming
Dilbert's CEO
will be asked to testify about the
dangers of AI
so they're going to be testifying about
the dangers of AI to Congress
it doesn't go well it doesn't go well
so uh
Euro Digital Services Act
threatening Twitter I need to know more
about that
yeah Europe seems to be a little little
difficult to navigate huh
boy I didn't realize that Twitter would
become such a Target
um
four are trying to be balanced
but it doesn't look balanced if you were
left-wing
talk more about AI
I think you don't really want that do
you
what's up with the price of gas
is the price of gas up or down it looks
like you've been slowly slowly reducing
goes up
did it go up today
um
all right
Nvidia stock oh boy do I wish I had some
Nvidia stock so in video stock because I
guess they have a chip that works well
with AI that
that thou stalkers through the roof it's
like one of the most valuable companies
in the country now
it's gigantic now
uh
did I get my shirt at Walmart
I did not
it's a fresh clean tea
that's the name of the company
yeah so Katie Hobbs vetoed some
republican-led election reform stuff
but I read her arguments they weren't
terrible
but it did look still like it was a
Democrat versus Republican thing
yeah I mean obviously
she was voting for her team I don't
think she was looking out for the state
do you wash your t-shirts before you
wear them the first time let me put that
question to you
do you wash your clothes before you wear
them the first time
let's say it was in a package so nobody
nobody tried it on the store it's in the
package
well you're quite mixed on this lesson
knows and yeses
my guess is that it's probably cleaner
coming out of the package than it is
coming out of your washing machine
your wife does over your objections
um my answer to the question is uh it
depends
so I would wash it first if it were
wrinkly
and I would wash it first if I bought it
a little large because I expected it to
shrink
but if it were exactly the right size
and had no wrinkles let's say a t-shirt
that you're taking out of a package for
the first time I would wear it without
washing it
special case I wouldn't I wouldn't wear
a pair of pants
because you know that I bought at a
store because you wonder how many people
have had those pants on
wash it all
right here's another one how many of you
would wash
let's say spinach or lettuce
that came in a package that said it was
pre-washed
how many of you wash
pre-washed
salad
a lot of people wash pre-washed salad
but a lot of people don't
I used to
or even what about what if it doesn't
say it's pre-washed but it's obvious
that it was
suppose it's not labeled pre-washed but
you can just look at it it's obvious
that it was
do you wash it then
well you keep in mind when you when you
wash it you're probably just do it with
cold water right it's not like you're
washing it with soap I'm not sure how
much that cold water makes a difference
you put vinegar in it to crisp it
I've never heard of that
is that a thing you put vinegar in your
cold water to
crisp up your salad
I'll be damned
white vinegar well I learned something
there look at me learning stuff all
right I I've probably told you this
before but I once uh I dated a chef
so it was a woman who knew what she was
talking about food wise and actually
I've dated Two Chefs that's weird
I've dated two professional chefs never
realized that before until just now but
uh neither of them washed anything that
came into package if it came in the
package it was clean
that was their standard
I have a type
uh no it wasn't it wasn't when I owned
the restaurant it was actually unrelated
to my restaurant
we never we never had a female chef
at my restaurants
not that we didn't want one just none
applied
washing adds to labor costs that is
correct
all right
um
was sold after eating with
hydroxychloroquine
I had two restaurants for a while
do you wash chicken with soap
I stopped eating chicken so I solved
that problem
so I'm going to tell you something else
about Equinox but I can't tell you on
YouTube
so after after I turned off YouTube I'll
Tell the locals people a little a little
uh behind the curtains information
that will change a little change how you
think about that story
all right YouTube thanks for joining uh
we'll see you tomorrow
and uh I'm gonna go talk to the locals
people now and uh thanks for joining
