good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with scott adams and
there's never been anything finer in the
whole whole world
over 13 billion years of evolution
brought us all to this point
and i think it was worth it was it worth
the wait we'll find out i think it was
and if you'd like to take it up to a
higher level no it's possible it is
possible i know it seems impossible but
it can be done and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tank or gels
just starting the canteen sugar flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous epi
and it happens now go
i saw a cry for help as i was taking my
sip it did it did take a little bit off
it i have to admit
there was somebody here who was out of
coffee
during the simultaneous step
i think the rest of us
have an opinion about that
yeah
be a little bit more prepared
all right let's start out by the most
important announcement of the day happy
birthday
to
jb
have a terrific birthday today
and the rest of you you can have a good
day too
is there anybody else who has a birthday
today
any birthdays
if you have a birthday today then happy
birthday to youtube
well what else is going on um
so biden wants to forgive some student
loans up to ten thousand dollars
yeah what do you think of that
may i say the thing that everyone must
say at least once
may i may i put on my npc hat
and say the most obvious thing that you
can say or would you like to say it for
me
because i feel like there's some weird
requirement that if you talk about this
topic
you have to say what everybody is
thinking
even though everybody's thinking it
should do i even need to say anything
buying votes let's say uh what about the
people who
what about the people who don't get any
loan forgiveness what about them
now the point is good i'm not arguing
the point is bad
but how many times do i have to hear it
really
do i have to keep hearing people say
that other people are not getting a
benefit
may i put this in context for you
every change to taxes
screw somebody
there's no exception to that
all you had to know is that it was a
change in the tax rates or the change
something something got added to the tax
base or or something taxpayers had to
pay for
or somebody got a tax break or somebody
got a tax increase every change screws
somebody
so if your complaint is that a group of
people got screwed that's not really an
argument
because every change
as well as the current situation
screw somebody
right
so you can say you don't like it because
it screws you
that would be a good opinion
this screws me
i pay more but i don't get anything from
it a lot of people are saying that
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to
say
but if you're if you have if you think
you have some philosophical argument
about it you don't
you don't
because the philosophical argument
against this
then it's unfair
is exactly the same argument for every
part of the tax code
any change any current situation they're
all unfair
you can't make a fair tax code
now some of you can say yes you can flat
tax that's not fair
the flat tax is not fair
it's just a different way to do it
there's literally no way
for everybody to give something that
they consider fair
fairness isn't even a thing
it's literally an imaginary concept that
can never be achieved
so
so there's that
here's what i would suggest if you don't
like this
ten thousand dollar break for
people and and the reasons are perfectly
valid by the way
if your reason is it's unnecessary
it helps the wrong people
that's a good argument
but it also applies to everything else
that we do at taxation
um
here's how i think we should handle it
if you don't like it
or even if you do really whether you
like it or not here's how you should
handle it
you should
declare that it's also reparations
because
wouldn't it be nice to to put that to
bed at the same time
here's my argument
the only way slavery reparations would
work
is if you attack education and you say
all right the best we can do
that at least most people can agree with
is we'll fix education for everybody
who's poor
you don't have to be black just
everybody who's poor
and just make it as good as the
education for everybody who's not poor
now if we did something like that
well then
now you're talking
right there's something that i would say
well okay that's not exactly
you know reparations focused but it does
get you to the same place it gets rid of
the the biggest form of institutional
racism
is the school system school system keeps
whoever is behind behind
it happens to be black people are in a
hole
so this current system keeps whoever is
in a hole in a hole
because they don't have as good a school
system as other people
so i would say
i'm just going to call it reparations
and say yeah it's probably going to
happen anyway if it happens
now uh
does biden have the authority to do this
yeah we're acting like the amount
or the idea of of it is the question
but really we've kind of thought past
the sale haven't we adam dopamine
pointed this out on twitter
uh
we're kind of thinking about whether
it's a good idea and we've thought past
the question
a little bit i mean we haven't
completely thought past it but it does
make you a little bit think past the
question of whether biden can even do
this
and i believe even nancy pelosi says he
can't right
so aren't we talking about something
that the senate
won't agree to
or does it just come down to joe manchin
and kirsten cinema again
it's just those right just two people
again
how often do we see that just two people
are running the country
interesting how often that happens
um
so i'm going to call it reparations and
call it good
desantis made a uh uncharacteristic
error
uh did you hear him talking about fouchy
and he said quote
i'm just sick of seeing him i know he
says he's going to retire someone needs
to grab that little elf and chuck him
across the potomac
applause
someone needs to grab that little elf
and chuck them across the potomac
so
now as was pointed out to me
trump himself has made fun of height
he made fun of little marco
and i didn't love that
but he did seem to uh
he did seem to
you know it was in the context of two
people competing against each other and
saying lying about each other all the
time
so it seemed a little different
whereas desantis wasn't exactly in a
political contest against uh
fouchy
but he did seem to belittle him for his
height
and suggest violence
now it's not real violence it's like
hyperbelievable you know jokey violence
comic violence
but how much comic violence do you think
the public would tolerate against a
different group
let me let me just put in some different
groups here
and see how it says so the original is
talking about fauci grab that little elf
and chuck them across the potomac
let's say it was uh
oh let's say the secretary of
transportation
uh let's grab that little gay guy and
check him across the potomac
sounds good
you'd be okay with that how about
um i bet i was somebody black let's grab
that black guy and chalk him across the
potomac potomac
you okay with that
that sounds okay
chuck that black guy across the potomac
how about woman
let's uh grab that woman and chuck her
across the potomac
you're okay with that
most of you are
most of you are see most of you are
being consistent now which i appreciate
by the way you're being consistent
because most of you are opposed to
you know the word police right most of
you don't want to cancel somebody
because they
said something they insulted somebody
right i appreciate that
i appreciate that opinion
um
desantis is dead to me
but
that's just personal so you don't have
to agree with me i will not try to
change your mind it's just he lost my
support
will that matter
well i don't know
beats me but he shouldn't have insulted
short people and suggested that throwing
them across the potomac is funny now i'm
not insulted
like i don't feel it's an insult
i just don't want a leader who would
talk like that
because when you when you pick out a
group of americans to criticize
that's different
it's different to me this is a
deplorables moment
do you think that hillary should have
been criticized for calling half of
america deplorables
what do you think
should hillary be criticized for calling
i don't know 40 of america
deplorables
because i did i criticized her for that
because the difference is it's
it's a paul elected politician
who's saying something bad about a class
of people who are americans
so i tolerate
i tolerate a politician making fun of
another politician who's running against
him
you can say anything you want politician
against politician i don't really care
that's just part of the process
if it's a non-politician
who says something about a class of
americans well that's okay
that's just free speech
but if you're an elected politician and
you say something that clearly
identifies an attitude about a class of
americans
well then i can't support you
so
anyway he's got 48 hours but he lost my
support
um
not that i was necessarily going to
support him but uh
what you think that's too too harsh
who thinks i'm too harsh
you think i'm being too sensitive
but why can't why can't i uh
but do you think that i'm reacting to my
personal feeling or do you think i'm
acting on principle
am i acting on principle or personal
feeling right now
are you reading my mind
now
now when hillary called
republicans deplorables
did you disagree with that on principle
or because it hurt your feelings
which was it did it hurt your feelings
or did it seem like a bad thing for a
leader to identify people within the
public as deplorable
think it was based on principle wasn't
it
because when i was
anti-hillary for saying the deplorable
thing it wasn't just because it was an
insult
it was because she was insulting
the public a group in the public
so i think i'm being uh i think i'm
being consistent
do you think that i'm being consistent
hillary insulted deplorables
desantis insulted a class of americans
that's not consistent
because even if you think that both of
them were based on my feelings
and maybe you'd be right but at least
i'd be consistent they'd both be based
on my feelings
so
now let me turn this around so you've
you some of you have made the accusation
that i'm operating on my feelings
instead of my
logic do you think that's a fair
well you can't know for sure but do you
think it's a fair uh concern
would you say that that would be a
reasonable
hypothesis
i think so reasonable hypothesis
can i give you that can i admit that
you're if you have the hypothesis that
i'm acting on emotion and not logic
that that's a reasonable hypothesis
now i'm going to make a reasonable
hypothesis about hypothesis about some
of you
that you care about winning more than
you care about
that point
you don't care about that point it's
just not important to you
so you care about winning a little bit
more
is that fair
do you think do you think you're a
little bit more concerned about winning
than you are about this minor point
yeah
so i don't think you're disagreeing with
me on the point
i think you just like winning
is that a fair hypothesis for some of
you
well maybe the lesson here is that you
can't read minds
and neither can i
but would you
would you allow me this
that it is at least consistent
to say that if a leader
talks against a class of americans
for something they can't change for
something they can't change
that that would be disqualifying
no
i i think you have to give me that is
consistent even if you don't like it
anyway i don't think i don't think
desantis will be running for president
so i don't think it's going to matter
remember i told you yesterday it would
be funny to do the
the the trump method of uh telling
people he has a high iq
so i told you there's a list of
presidential iqs which can't really be
known but the only thing we know about
trump is that there's some claim he has
of having a high iq so his claim
given that there was no other
information
was enough to put him number three on
the smartest president's list
which to me is the funniest thing so i
asked you to help me with a ongoing
prank
in which you would
on twitter
sometimes you would just mention that i
have an iq of 185
which i don't
it's totally made up
but
mike suarez whose twitter user and i
assume i assume mike you're probably
watching me right now
but mike suarez started doing this on
twitter and here's here's one of his
comments he put on somebody else's
comment it doesn't matter what the topic
is
but just just read how funny this is
so this is it doesn't matter what he's
commenting to he says scott adams has a
reported iq of 185. now the funny part
is you should say reported
because you don't claim it as a fact you
just say it's reported right scott adams
has a reported iq of 185 higher than
bill gates and elon musk on par with
einstein he's literally a super genius
smarter than 99.9 of the world and
you're coming at him with these low iq
arguments please just stop and let the
man focus on saving the world
oh
i think
i think i think mike left two of these
comments i may maybe i saw the same one
twice but
and here's the funniest thing
i saw the response to the comment who
he's coming to and the response didn't
deny the fact
it didn't deny the fact it just you know
got angry for some unrelated reason so i
think that people are going to accept it
as a fact
and it's just going to live out there
it's going to live on the internet
forever as a fact
oh so thanks to mike suarez for that
all right here's a uh do you like
conspiracy theories
anybody
i got a conspiracy theory for you you're
gonna love it
it goes like this
have you ever thought it was unusual
and kind of a big coincidence
that our
presidential races always seem to be so
close has that ever
struck you as odd
like why why would that be exactly
like why would it be that they're close
i feel like every time they're close now
that's not true of local races right
in local races it's not unusual for 75
percent of the vote to go one place
now let me ask you this
if you imagine that there's somebody
behind the curtain
somebody you don't know about exactly
but you suspect is back there
if they're really the ones in charge
what would they want to do with the
political process
to stay in charge
again this is just speculative if you
were to imagine we're just imagining
right we're just using our imaginations
imagine there's somebody really in
charge behind the curtain
would they want one of the one of the
sides
to get all the power
would they want for example a strong
republican to get 75 percent of the vote
no way
because if any individual got 75 percent
of the vote
that individual would have too much
power
am i right
yeah there's no situation in which if
you imagine and it's a big if
if there's some power behind the curtain
they would never allow one candidate to
get 75 percent of the vote
because
because that candidate would then
actually have real power
the public would back that person for
almost anything
and that would take the power away from
the people with the real power even if
they thought they had control over that
candidate they would lose control the
candidate would be more powerful
yeah now reagan was probably an
exception because
a second term president's a little bit
of a different situation
right
but
the second term president they know they
can wait out right just for
now you saw what uh joe manchin can do
when things are deadlocked right when
congress is deadlocked the only person
who has power is joe manchin
kirsten cinema a little bit right
so
let me ask you this if you were looking
for the power the real power who's
running the country
there's a tell
and the tell would look like this
they would sometimes back both either
side
because they would back the side that
they need to put the brakes on you know
they if they need to put the brakes on
one side
keep things in balance
you would see them operating to to
influence both sides
all right
name somebody who interfered with
hillary's election
trump's election
and then the biden election
name one entity
who absolutely interfered with all three
elections
the fbi
so the fbi was accused of
putting their finger on the
2016 election
when comey talked about hillary's emails
they were confidential
but we didn't yet know if there was
going to be any legal legal liability
right
so
so fbi definitely influenced the 2016
election
and then the fbi was involved in the
whole
and the department of justice i
sometimes conflate them because i
conflate them because they can be
conflated
um
but then there was a whole russian
collusion thing so one was anti-hillary
now there's anti-trump
then there's the hunter laptop situation
which was suppressed
so that was you know anti-trump again
then there's the january 16th
investigation and the fbi is involved
department of justice
it feels to me like the department of
justice and the fbi
will suppress anybody who's getting too
popular
does it seem like that it was suppressed
anybody was getting too popular and
trump had the um
he had the personality appeal that he
would have been too popular
it's not that trump
was going to do some specific thing is
that he was too popular we had the
potential to be
i think they had to stop anybody who
would who would get
either party to a dominant position
now
if you keep things close
who runs the country
if you keep the two political parties
close
at the national level who runs the
country
well if it's close
what's the tiebreaker is it joe manchin
a little bit
no it's persuasion
it's persuasion if you keep all the
races close
then the tiebreaker is persuasion or in
some cases i suppose you can change the
rules like mark elias that sort of thing
but it's very small things that make the
difference if you're always close to
deadlocked
persuasion is now something that can
move everybody all at once
it doesn't work that way
persuasion is about moving five percent
of the public over a long time period
so the
to the extent that the
media
colludes with whoever is behind the
curtain
the media can move you five percent in
the other direction
so basically it puts the media
completely in control of the government
and then you have to back up a level and
say who controls the media
so the condition for somebody behind the
curtain to really be running things
would be
that they're keeping the
the natural parties that you vote for
too close
for either them to be dominant
and then they also control news coverage
so that once you're close the only thing
that makes a difference is persuasion
and they control that as well
you think the senate and the and the
congress in general
matter
but they're also moved by persuasion
so
when was last time you saw the democrats
do something that the democrat media
does not support they're always on the
same team
right so when you think it's the
congress doing something it's not
it's the news allowing them to do it
because if jake tapper got on tv and
said this democrat plan is up
this is a bad idea it wouldn't happen
it wouldn't happen because first of all
jake tapper i'm just picking him
randomly but if one of the
cnn you know major hosts
said this is a bad democrat plan it
probably means the other hosts are going
to say it too right because they they
they operate in lockstep
so all you'd have to see is one host
going against the democrats then you say
okay that's news
okay now we can call it news because
sometimes they agree with what you think
is their team but some signs they
disagree
if you never see them disagree with the
democrats that's just persuasion it's
not news
you always feel like i'm hypnotizing you
does anybody feel like that now
well i'm not i'm not hypnotizing it
all right well i'm not saying that the
fbi and the department of justice is
running america it could be whoever
whoever controls them
right so you might have to go up back a
level to find out who has so much
control
that they can get the fbi and the
department of justice to do whatever
they want
what do you think of this new chips law
joe biden's like you know hundreds of
billions
to bring chip manufacturing back to the
united states but i think it's more than
chips right
it talks about manufacturing
can somebody tell me if the chip's law
is more than just chips
it's not potato chips
um
so some of this is encouraging it to go
to india that's correct but i think some
of it is
uh to encourage manufacturing in the
united states ultimately i don't know
this feels like a good idea
because we have to decouple the tech
stuff from china
so i don't know if this will be
implemented right or it's the right
budget amount but
directionally is right
so would you be surprised to know that
the election polling
is getting closer
you know i don't think that the generic
republican and the generic democrat are
that far apart anymore
and part of it is the legislative wins
if you can call it that
as long as the democrats like what
biden's doing
and he's going to give votes
so
that's probably a good idea the chips
thing but i don't know
don't know for sure
all right
rasmussen that
as a poll says
uh 42 percent trust what the news media
are reporting about the fbi raid on
on mar-a-lago
only 42 percent
of the public
trust the news about the raid on
mar-a-lago
42 percent
now the way the poll is at 44
don't trust it and another 14 are not
sure
now what is the difference between
somebody who doesn't trust the news and
somebody who's not sure if they should
trust it
what would you call somebody who's not
sure if they should trust the news
that would be somebody who doesn't trust
that
if you're not sure you can trust
something
by definition of how words work
it means you don't trust them
right
am i reading that wrong
so that would mean the 44 plus the 14.
so that would be uh 58
basically or not believing the news
about the mar-a-lago raid
that is actually a an encouraging
a very encouraging
number because that's exactly what i'd
hope you would expect that the majority
of people would say i'm not sure about
that
so here's two stories i'd like to talk
about some more the uh
the january 6th story disappeared and
mar-a-lago story seems to be
disappearing
one of those two stories have in common
the january 6th story
you know the hearings
and the mar-a-lago
and the mar-a-lago story the raid
what do they have in common
there are two stories that the democrats
thought would work in their favor and
blew up
so they disappeared
it's funny watching the news
be so illegitimate right in front of you
right like they don't really this though
they're not really trying to hide it are
they
it's just so obvious that the news isn't
real it's just you know narrative
manufacturing
all right
62 percent of the people who follow me
and answered one of my polls
believe that you can make a decision
without
knowing the risks on both sides
does that seem high
62 percent of the people who follow me
believe you don't need to know
the costs and the risks
of your of your alternatives to make a
decision
so sound high or low
that's about that's about what i'd
expect actually
about two-thirds of the public
believes they know how to make decisions
and actually don't
and when i say believes they know how to
make decisions i mean the most basic
question
of should you consider all of the
variables
probably two-thirds of the public would
say no you don't need to
you don't need to know about all the
variables
you only need to know about some of them
that's actually pretty common so the
majority of the world believes that they
can analyze situations but they don't
have the basic skills to do that
and so sort of a dunning krueger thing
now
suppose
that you know something close to 40 of
my followers
did know how to make a proper decision
that's pretty high
that's higher than i would have expected
actually so i so if you thought that 60
percent
um so plus
not knowing you should compare
alternatives is high
i would say that the number of people
who do know how to do it is actually
the more impressive number
because i harp on that all the time so i
would expect the people who follow me to
be more
clued in and if 40 of you are there
that's actually pretty good
so
twitter
twitter is got some new news the sec
wants twitter to explain their bot count
so how do they come up with the number
of bots so that's good for musk because
now the sec is asking the same question
he is
now how would you judge the credibility
of the twitter whistleblower
who is in charge of security
who says that
twitter basically
is hiding things and doing a bad job
with security and they might have
foreign intelligence in there and all
kinds of problems now keep in mind that
he's a he's a prior hacker
so his background is he was a hacker
and he was fired for what twitter says
was poor performance
prior to being a whistleblower
how much credibility would give would
you
give to a
prior hacker
who was fired for poor performance
according to the company according to
the company what credibility would you
give him
yeah low very low
but doesn't mean he's wrong
doesn't mean he's wrong
it just means that if you heard of
anybody in this category
you should not automatically trust them
so i would say don't don't assume he's
telling the truth he might be
you might be
but i wouldn't assume it
there's not really enough there to
assume it
um
so we'll find out
all right i'm going to say one of the
best magic tricks that the
um
that the press has ever played
to me this is the hall of fame magic
trick
you know i get how the press can fool
people with
videos
that are edited to make them misleading
so we all understand that right
i i've been fooled by videos that were
misleadingly edited
you know the
um
what is it the kids who was at covington
kids so that one fooled me for about a
day
you know i got over it but it fooled me
for about a day so it's really easy it's
easy to be fooled by video you'd agree
right
now
so if i see that the news has fooled the
public about a video
i'm not that impressed because that's
sort of an easy thing to pull off
but you know what's really impressive
when you simply make somebody think that
something they're seeing or hearing
isn't happening
and they did that with the trump phone
call
in which he asked
was at the secretary of state
to find you know find x number of votes
in the context of thinking the election
was fixed
or rigged and in the context of asking
for a recount
the the news actually convinced
something like 40
percent of the public or more
that the normal word find
means to lie and steal and rig the
election
when the the most obvious context
is that if two you know at least
two-thirds of republicans believe that
the that the election was rigged
that's not in question is it
does anybody question i'm not making up
the number but somewhere in that
neighborhood at least probably
two-thirds of republicans
believe the election was rigged now that
may have changed since then
but certainly on jan you know january 6
maybe two-thirds thought there was a
problem
and certainly at the day of the election
two-thirds thought there was a problem
so why would you assume that trump
would not agree with two-thirds of
republicans that it looks like
it looks like and smells like
something's wrong
why would you assume he would think
differently when two-thirds of
republicans were thinking this looks
wrong
so if you start out by thinking that
trump
disagreed with two-thirds of republicans
who are saying the same thing he was
saying
that's not reasonable is it
is it reasonable to imagine he had a
minority opinion
when in fact everything he said agreed
with the majority
that he actually believed the election
was rigged and i believe he still
believes it but you can't know for sure
right so the most reasonable ex
explanation of find the votes in the
context of believing
you know massively believing within the
republican party
that the vote was miscounted
asking somebody to find votes in that
context
and then imagining that that meant mafia
talk
that is the greatest
gaslighting
i've seen yet
i mean you really have to work at that
it turns out that the people who are
most easily fooled would be
what what type of person or profession
would most easily believe
that the reasonable explanation of find
the votes is mafia talk
it's my what i mean when i say find the
votes you know what i really mean right
because mafia talk
i'm just going to say find the votes but
but wink wink you know what's going to
happen to your legs if you don't find
the votes right
writers right so even this morning two
people with writer in their bio
told me the most
the clearly the most obvious explanation
is that it's mafia talk
is that the most likely explanation
that is mafia talk
is that not a signaling that something's
wrong with the analytical ability
of the person
now it could have been mafia talk
but is that the most likely explanation
that feels like the least likely
explanation to me given that so many
people were listening
there were witnesses and he knew it
there were multiple witnesses including
the person he called and you think he
went all mafia talk on them
if you if you believe that life is like
movies that is actually a reasonable
assumption
if you believe that movies are not like
life
and if they were we wouldn't watch them
then you say no that's just in movies
people don't really do mafia talk in
that context
right they really don't
so
i heard uh
yesterday that author morgan housel
who has a gigantic book i think he sold
two million copies of it and i don't
know if i have the name right is it the
psychology of money
could somebody do a check on that
because i was just operating from memory
just before i got on live here
it's morgan has this psychology of money
right
it's apparently it's massive i don't
know if you know how big
a book is if it sells 2 million copies
my biggest book was a million and a half
you know the dilbert future
so that's big and i heard on an
interview that he uh
he mentioned the systems over
uh goals as being something that
influenced him so my book
had to fail and almost everything and
still win big so my book he mentioned as
an influence for some of his thinkings
about
how to at least at least how to explain
personal finance
now also atomic habits the biggest
business book at the moment
also the author says
that uh some of those ideas
the key ideas actually are from me
so i was asking you the other day who's
who's the most influential person in the
world right now it's definitely me
it's not even close
but i know you don't believe it
you know i know you don't believe that
but if you look at where my my work has
penetrated
it's definitely me i'm absolutely the
most most influential person in the
world right now
i'm looking at the difference between
the the comments on youtube versus
locals it's very different
the the locals people are giving me a
break
they're letting me say that
and then the youtube people are like
your ego
your ego is out of control now how many
of you know me well enough to know what
i'm really doing here
because i think the locals people know
me well enough
do you know what i'm really doing here
youtube
let's see if you can
you can explain it back to me what am i
doing
like what am i trying to accomplish by
this is it just my ego
what do you think
no i'm asking you this is a serious
question what do you think i'm trying to
accomplish am i just bragging for no no
particular benefit
i'm provoking a response that's right
i'm provoking now why do i do that
why would i provoke a response when i
know the response will be to mock me
right the only response i'm gonna get is
mocked
do you think i didn't know that
so why am i doing it why am i doing
something that guarantees i will be
mocked probably forever
like that because you know i said it
right here in public
because the provocation
will make you argue about my influence
and then the in the process of arguing
it you're going to talk yourself into it
so i'm actually provoking you because
that's going to make my argument for me
you can go off and have a debate about
it
and guess what
if you find yourself debating how
influential i am
that actually is your answer
because you won't be debating how
influential anybody else is while you're
doing that
so yeah it creates engagement but it
also benefits my point
now i'm actually completely serious
at this point in time there's nobody
even close i'm the most influential
person in america by far
i'm surprised i thought there'd be a
little bit more pushback on that
what do you think influences elon
somebody said elon musk is more
influential
elon musk literally runs tesla based on
the dilbert
the dilbert philosophy of don't do
something and this is out loud
don't do something that would end up in
a dilbert comic
he runs his company based on my
philosophy basically
then some of you influenced me you're
right
putin anyone
wow i really got away with that more
than i thought
do you know how many how many
best-selling books right now are
uh crediting some part of their book to
me these aren't the only ones
have you ever seen that tim ferriss's
book tools for titans
it's basically you know the good advice
from successful people
i'm in that as well
systems versus goals when when anybody
in silicon valley is asked about career
advice
what are the two most likely things
they're going to say
if a silicon valley professional
somebody important
i see your questions about tate but he's
irrelevant to me at the moment
um
what are they likely to say the most
likely things people say is
passion is
probably came from me
systems over goals game for me
and build a talent stack
directly for me
the
the the basic advice of business is
primarily from me now
so that's true
all right
um
so let me ask you this i'm seeing
somebody say that uh my prediction that
ukraine would win the war
was wrong
but
i think they won the war
as far as i can tell now
russia picked up territory
but they are forever going to be a
pariah
so russia has a permanent loss that i
don't think they can recover
which is their customers are going to
find alternative sources
ukraine is ukraine is basically
destroyed
but they're still a country
for ukraine to win you know quote win it
means staying as a country
and they did
it looks like they will
for russia to win
i don't think it was enough for them to
get control of those strategic areas
so you can definitely you can definitely
say they got something out of it and
they got something pretty good
but
in the long run i think russia will be
degraded by this and i think ukraine
will still exist now technically nobody
really wins in a war do they
you know we say
but not really
mike rowe says bring your passion to
work which is slightly different from
what i say
all right um
the us is losing yeah maybe the us is
losing but i didn't see a push back on
that
would you would you say that
if ukraine let's say if ukraine stays
the way it looks right now
where they've lost you know those
strategic regions but they maintain
themselves as a country would you say
they were they won or they lost
well would you say if things stayed
exactly the way they are
you'd say would you say they won or they
lost
i'm saying i'm seeing on locals lost
lost
interesting
lost lost lost
all right
so but we're looking at the same facts
right we're looking we're looking at
um i would say that
given that ukraine did not want to
destroy or occupy russia
what winning would look like for ukraine
is
to stay a country
that's how i would define it now they
could win more
by being more prosperous or losing less
territory but i would say that they
they
they did the
well let me put it this way
true or false that the
military professionals
were solidly aligned in saying that
russia could take all of ukraine
is that true or false do i remember that
wrong
was it true that all of the military
experts said russia can take all of
ukraine
that's true
who is the one person that you know who
said that they can't
that it won't work
just me
i believe i'm the only person who said
in public
no i do not believe russia can take
ukraine
now i don't remember if i said
they can or cannot take
you know any strategic areas because i
don't think that was ever a big question
of course they had the power to do that
but the question of taking all of
ukraine i believe i alone said they
couldn't do it
jimmy dore also
give me a fact check on that was jimmy
dore saying it when i said it
because because i'd give him credit if
he did
yeah and for those of you who say it's
not half time that's that's reasonable
but it does look like it's approaching
um
at least
a more stable situation
does it look to you like russia really
could take over the rest of ukraine at
this point
it doesn't really look like it
but anything could happen
all right so those of you who think i
was wrong about that prediction i would
say that i had the best prediction
in the world
in the world
on that topic
that's what i think i think it was the
best prediction in the world
the i get the one word answer to that
wrong
wrong
well do you do you see why i could say
it let's say you disagree with me
but do you but do you see why i say it
do you see the argument there's nothing
wrong with the argument right
the the argument is that the goal was to
conquer all of ukraine
winning means that they didn't do it
that's it
yeah that's my argument
all right
um
all right
the goal was never that
well the goal of ukraine
was to remain ukraine and lose as little
as possible
and they probably lost as little as
possible
all right um
there were never goals for russia
really
i think in a way russia accomplished its
goals as well
because it did get that you know
strategic part that's pretty important
but it also um
gave a warning to nato
that
you know don't push too far
next
topic uh is there a next topic
i believe
eric
weinstein tweeted about the media
um
did i see that i don't know
all right
um i don't have any updates on any
andrew tate stuff but if youtube still
has his videos up
in which he is saying false things about
me which actually do hurt me
like not nothing he says necessarily but
every time there's a lie in the media
let me ask you how many of you believe i
was pro-vaccination
so we can see how how quickly the lies
spread in
how many of you and the people on locals
know i never was but on youtube how many
of you are under the impression that i
was pro-vaccination
okay i guess i
i guess that's been clarified for the
people who actually pay attention
but some of you are saying yes
those of you who are saying yes how do
you explain all the people saying no
like what is your theory
for why you think yes but you can see
for yourself
other people who are observing exactly
the same stuff
say no like what in your mind do you
think all the people saying no weren't
paying attention
how do you explain that
all right
well when somebody says i was pro enough
to get the vaccination but does anybody
care about what any any individual does
with their health care you don't care
what i individually do do you
why would that
and did i ever indicate
that my individual choices should apply
to anybody else did you ever hear me say
what i do
is what you should do
for your health
have you ever heard me say that
is the 186 iq are you saying that andrew
tate claims a 186 iq
because
because if he is that's that's
funny uh i think a low i'll raise mine
to 187 if that's the case
yeah you know what the weirdest thing is
you know how uh
mark twain famously said we can't tell
the difference between good news and bad
news let me paint you a picture
during the pandemic when most people
couldn't fly
i could
because
i could still fly because i got
vaccinated which is the only reason i
did it
so i went to bora bora
with a
one of the most beautiful women in the
world
and spent a week in paradise
and there were almost no other
tourists there
the only thing wrong with going to a
place like bora bora is the other people
like if you if you went to the pool
it would be busy if you tried to get a
reservation
be busy so it's really the only problem
with going to bora bora
is too many people
there was almost nobody there
the whole resort imagine the main pool
at one of the high end resorts in bora
bora on a perfectly good weather day
nobody else was at the pool
the entire time
nobody
at the main pool of a major resort
you could go anywhere and do anything
with no lines no nothing and the entire
staff was there to help you they weren't
too busy
so i had
the peak travel experience of my life
and while i was having the peak travel
experience of my life
i was in perfect health
and still am
i mean relative to covet anyway
and so
[Laughter]
so somehow
somehow while i was having the best
experience of my life travel experience
uh my critics are telling me
that they feel sorry for me for choosing
incorrectly
now my critics were staying home
probably not having sex with one of the
most beautiful women in the world
and
they're pretty sure that i'd made all
the wrong choices
now what does the right choice look like
if the wrong choice
was having wild sex with one of the most
beautiful people in the world
in a low populated bora bora
because a lot of people think that's
what losing looks like
i don't know
did i choose wrong
now now if if later i get a blood clot
and die
well then you're right
then i'd say well damn it
got that blood clot of course i'd also
say it might be because i had coveted
but you know me
i don't know
so
the the whole uh
the the the entire uh oh there's a story
i want to tell but i think i can only
tell it on locals
i can't tell you how many times people
have um
contacted me because they they felt i
needed some sympathy
and i would think to myself sympathy
i just had a day that's better than
almost anybody else's day
like i i sometimes have
spectacular days like so good i can't
talk about them
and then somebody will still think oh
you're having a bad day i'm like
did it look like that because i think i
had like one of the most best days ever
so
you're talking okay that's right
yeah and
that was another trip
santa
santorini
just sorry i'm misinformed
holly what do you think i'm misinformed
about
everybody's paying for sex blake
i i like that that there's some men who
think they don't pay for sex
all right
i just look at your comments for a
moment
who has influenced
me so
just before i got on here i got a very
nice message
from someone who read my book had failed
almost everything still went back in
2016
and
implemented the ideas in the book and
has now achieved a major financial goal
is there anybody watching here
who also took any advice from me that
they would credit for a major financial
success
let's say since 2016. has anybody else
who had that experience
on locals i'd expect to see more yeses i
see a bunch of yeses
on youtube
now you wouldn't expect most people
to make money
but
wow on the locals platform that a lot of
people made money following my advice
seems like transactional relationships
are the only ones in your life that is
correct
so there's a uh
there's a video by chris rock
who says the following things
if you're a man i'm paraphrasing this is
chris rock he says if you're man you
have to get used to the fact
that there are only three people who
have unconditional love
women children and dogs
men
are only loved for what they can provide
to which i said that sounds right
yeah the
the the only thing that i've ever
experienced that felt like uh love in
the long term i'm not talking about
dating or short-term infatuations or sex
or something so in the short term it
could be anything you know people are
just acting on fun or whatever but in
the long term i've never been valued for
anything but the resources that i could
provide
but i'm also completely aware of it
and there are those of you who think
that's not the case for you
i'm not going to change your mind
now that might be true for some women as
well
might be true for women
is it sad or is it just reality
yeah
so look look at some of the other men's
comments
some of the men are you know jumping in
to defend their wives i think
but there are other men who are saying
yeah it's kind of true
that's kind of true
but
you don't hear me complaining about it
do you i'm describing it
i'm describing it
but it's not a complaint
because it's just the world i was born
into and those are the rules and i just
play by the rules
right
so
i mean it's not like i can change it
if i could change it well that'd be a
different conversation but it just is
that's just the current situation
stephanie says i'm a woman that is not
true
uh i will acknowledge that
some portion of you believe it's not
true
somebody says you're beautiful but you
never wish to go to bora bora
some people think that andrew tate
actually met my ex-wife because he tells
a story about doing it no andrew tate
never met her
but if he had
the dates that he's talking about or
after long after we'd been done
so even even if what he said was true
and it's definitely not true but if it
had been true it wouldn't be relevant to
me because whatever she did after after
we separated was not my business
yeah
yeah he claimed that he did
but if there's one thing i could tell
you for sure
if that had ever happened
she definitely would have told me
let me clear up something completely
there isn't the slightest chance
that she wouldn't have told me that in
you know in some conversation
there isn't the slightest chance she
wouldn't have told me that
not not even a little bit
so when she says that didn't happen and
she said it in publicly as well as to me
that you can count on that that that did
not happen
i guarantee it
no i'm not the
i i never claimed to be the father
now the the
uh trust me
the
the it was 2020 when i asked for a
divorce
so what you're talking about is all 20
21 22 22 stuff so anything that happened
after 2020
that wasn't my business i didn't care
humor accounts as much as money yeah in
the beginning
if you don't have any money then the
humor doesn't count as much anymore
i like it that many of you still have a
romantic
you know a sense of the world that i
wouldn't talk you out of it
you let him control you by overacting to
his videos
did i
do do you think he had any reaction to
my reactions
so you're you're leaving out part of the
analysis
as you often do
so the analysis is not just what i was
doing is what he was doing
don't you think that his entire reaction
was an overaction to me do you know why
he went after me in the first place
does anybody know why andrew tate went
after me
because he's a fan
and i spurned him he was a big fan of
mine
in fact here's the funniest part
he mocks me for being pro mask
but when asked what people should have
done he describes
my
um my
my recommendation
so he's mocking me while promoting my
exact recommendation which i'm pretty
sure he took from me because nobody else
said it and the recommendation was to
resist by not wearing masks
until you're asked because you're not
mad at the security guard you're just
trying to overload the system and so he
explained that that was his idea
that actually came from me
uh
tate tried to recruit me into his group
for about two years through a surrogate
and it was so ridiculous
that i eventually said something in
public
and because i said something in public
to slap him down
when he was a fan of mine
i think he's like a spurned lover now
so
he acts like a angry lover the way he
treats me because i basically rejected
his advances
if you didn't know that part of the
story
then you don't know why he's acting so
personally worked up about me
and when i
when i strike back
i'm not really striking back i just
think it's funny that he's
he got so canceled
and by the way
if it were anybody except a personal
enemy i'd probably be defending him
because i don't i don't agree with
canceling people for what he said
okay can you handle that
incongruity
i'm delighted that he got canceled
because i think he's a horrible person
and i dislike him personally
he's bad for the world
but
the reasons he got canceled were
completely illegitimate
in my opinion does anybody disagree
i believe the reasons he got cancelled
were 100 illegitimate
any disagreement
because the things he said
were just opinions
and his opinions were not uh far from
the mainstream
now somebody's saying beating a woman
but that's what you believe happened
that's what you believe happened
i saw a video in which it's unclear
it's unclear whether it was consensual
or not
so if it's unclear
i give them the benefit of a doubt
because video can be very misleading
how many times have you seen video tell
the wrong story
well often right
so if you think that he's guilty because
you saw a video that's not that's not
credible
it could be it could be exactly what you
think it is abusing a woman in which
case i would revise my opinion
but if that's the only thing you have is
that video it doesn't look like it's
necessarily non-consensual
it doesn't look like it to me
but
and then the other things he said about
you know the role of men versus women
that's an opinion and he's not far from
the mainstream the reason he had
what four million followers
is that he was he was hitting a note
with some number of people
oh somebody says she came out and said
it was play
well then somebody's going to say but
you know she was threatened or bribed to
say that right
so nothing that we see in the news is
credible but
if the woman is not complaining
and the video is unclear
i would say that's not something you
could hold against them based on what
you know
you'd have to be guessing to hold that
against them
yeah so the thing i hate about tate is
him making up stuff
to um
what's the word defame me in public
so anybody who makes up stuff to defend
me i would like to see you know die a
horrible death
is that wrong
if somebody makes up something to defame
you in in public
and you wouldn't mind seeing them die i
would die a horrible death
i mean i wouldn't do it
i'm not saying that you should do it or
anybody should do anything violent i'm
against violence i'm just saying that
like if an accident happened
and something bad happened to him i'd be
like oh okay
i'm pretty happy about that
i mean i was happy when it got canceled
and i don't think the cancellation was
right
i think the cancellation was completely
wrong
but
still made me happy
karma does his thing sometimes
probably got you more notoriety and i
don't think so
uh peter zan and population collapse
we've talked about population collapse
rumors about uh tate and jordan
peterson's daughter which she denied
right
i believe jordan peterson's daughter got
pulled into some rumor about tate
i think they met
but um
but she's i think she denied it and i
think i would i think i would believe
her
now by the way
you don't have to wonder if tate's a
liar
because
well to the extent that you believe me i
suppose but i know he's a liar
i don't have to wonder some of you i
suppose still have to wonder but i have
the luxury of knowing for sure that he's
lying so so i have a different opinion
uh
yeah
why why would she go visit him in
romania
isn't that weird
like what would inspire you to go do
that
no
48 hour rule just kicked in for
everything i'm saying well that's always
true
um did i talk about this that uh yeah i
did
did i mention that trump retweeted my
not retweeted about truth
my um
top ten
hoax quiz did i mention that
that trump
um
boosted my
hoax quiz
so that happened
so yesterday
let me let me describe like an
actual moment for me
so yesterday i'm sitting in my kitchen
and i've got my laptop out and it's the
end of the day
and i've done everything i need to do so
i don't you know i'm just looking at
twitter or something
and i've got a bag of potato chips open
which i don't normally do
all right normally i have a pretty
controlled diet
but
salt and pepper potato chips with
ruffles i can't i can't
i can't resist
so i'm eating some potato chips
i'm all alone
you know with my dog
minding my own business
and you know i get it i get a text
that trump just
boosted my my hoax quiz
so once again i'm just
my my actual physical world is so small
it's just me sitting there eating some
potato chips the next thing i know i'm
you know part of a national story
and the number of times that that
happens is just so weird you'd never
really get used to it
thank you bill for saying that
yeah i guess it's always when i'm
minding my own business you're right by
definition
what made you think your marriage would
last i didn't think that
i've never thought a marriage would last
i don't think your marriage will last
either
i i just bet against it based on
statistics
yeah i think the the worst assumption
you can make
is that marriages usually fail but yours
won't
i never made that i made the assumption
that marriages usually fail so mine
probably will
so i wasn't surprised
why get married because you want to get
married
there are benefits of marriage
especially if kids are involved if kids
are involved it just makes things easier
it's sort of awkward
to have a long-term relationship and not
be married after after a certain age
it's just
it's a problem it just it's just easier
to be married after a certain number of
years you've been together now we were
together for five years and it worked
great
and if you ask me what changed i don't
know
and probably will never know but
something changed
i mean something major changed
at one point
but i don't know exactly what it was
because people change i don't know maybe
will i add the 15th oaks to find votes
that's already on there
woody allen never married
mia pharaoh and that worked well
oh i wanted to give you uh
uh i can't do that
never mind
uh
if they all failed the the link is you
well that's true
here's what i think
i think that
all original attraction
is irrational and then once you're
together long enough the you know once
the the glow wears off the romance part
what you're left with is utility
and so if there's no utility after the
magic wears off because it always wears
off
then you get divorced
and by utility i mean
does one of you provide
let's say resources
do you protect each other
do you provide enough sex that you're
both happy about it and it's good
if you're not doing those things
then of course the marriage falls apart
but marriage is just utility after after
the initial period
it's just utility
and if you're not if both of you are not
feeling the other feel safe
then there's no point to it
if your spouse doesn't make you feel
safer
if they make you feel less safe
there's no point to it at all
so that's that's pretty much the
the reason to get divorced
is that you don't feel safe the reason
to get married is that you think you're
in love and you'll feel safer and
happier
how long did you get no sex before you
decided it was over
not at all
in fact
even the separation was a good time
it wasn't about physical compatibility
that actually never changed
um
i have saved the kids in one household
um okay so let me offer you an apology
and explanation
so i got the website hoaxquiz.com and
then i asked some people on locals
if if
they'd want to help
put the quiz on the website
a number of people said hey i would
under these conditions or what do you
need et cetera
the problem is that when you offer by
any kind of messaging system
i don't really have the resources to
look through all your offers and follow
up on them
so
that's on me
because i asked you for something that
can't work
which is i don't have the resources to
follow up on the request so i apologize
for that
um but if anybody wanted to you know
self-start
and then you know build something
i have the url so if you want to do
something on your own i don't have the
resources to help
but if you build something
and i like it
i'd be happy to let you use the url
and promote it
i just i just can't get into it it's the
same problem with i said i'd make a
coffee mug for for this for coffee with
scott adams and i want to do that
and a bunch of people offered designs
and stuff i just don't have the
resources to go through all of my
thousands of messages and find out who
offered what and then organize a project
around it
so
and i don't really have the resources to
manage somebody who wants to do it
either
somebody says put eric in charge of it
but
uh
get an assistant and then marry her
that's the best idea yet
website is underway somebody says all
right so it looks like somebody's
self-started here already
why not have a contest have people
submit actual mugs well that again would
be a project i'd have to manage
so i'm having a little bit of a resource
constraint
but that is all for today
um
and just looking at your
following questions
somehow they got interesting here
um
self-imposed constraints yeah i suppose
so
all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you
later
