foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
every day
every day I'm here to be your virtual
friend
are you lonely
well this is where you come it's like
having a friend who will shut up the
moment you put on the mute
but until when let's talk and if you'd
like this day to be
oh
hold on hold on I know it's wrong
and now
except that I can't see where to plug it
in
except hold on a second
that was that or how was that
all right we'll be back online here in a
minute
no problem
just before I went live I was saying to
the locals people I feel like there's
something I've got
and there was something I forgot I was
testing a little two-way connector
and now I know it doesn't work so
apparently you can't split
a USBC for audio now I know I can't
Splinter for audio
all right well as I was telling you
today will be amazing and I am your
virtual friend here every day and if
you'd like to take your experience up to
levels which nobody has ever experienced
before all you need is a cup or a mug or
glass
es time again team Joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
the end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip go
ah
ah simultaneity feels so good today
well yesterday was kind of amazing in
the history of Twitter and just watching
how the whole Elon Musk thing is
evolving
so you might remember that Twitter used
to have and I guess it still has this
feature called Periscope where it can do
live streaming and that's why I first
started before I moved to these
platforms and Elon Musk takes over
Twitter
and apparently yesterday
for the first time ever he turned on
periscope
and you got to you got to be at home
and watch in real time as you know the
richest man in the world who owns
Twitter
picks up his phone
goes live and doesn't know you know
exactly what's going to happen he's just
he's just playing with it so I think
there were over 300 000 people that saw
it on the replay probably had a few tens
of thousands of people were immediately
on it but the funny thing was that it
was it was built in 2015 and they hadn't
upgraded it so the the quality of the
feed
somebody was calling him 8-bit Elon and
he was laughing at that
but the fun part was
you got to be in the room
while he was designed redesigning
periscope like he's holding it in his
hand
and he's turning around and talking to
his staff
well the entire public is watching he's
telling you he's asking questions like
one of the questions he asked was can
everybody do this
which is a funny question can everybody
do this can they just turn it on and
they have periscope
the answer is yes but I don't know how
he activated
so it sounded as if he was uh
redesigning it in real time
and he just wanted a little more uh
resolution I think
so we'll see if Periscope turns into
anything
all right Saudi Arabia is joining the
bricks the brics
now so that's the end of the Petro
dollar situation and
does that mean the value of the dollar
will Plunge
I don't know yet
I don't think anybody knows how any of
this stuff works
I'm convinced the economists are just
bluffing
this is making stuff up
you know I don't think the FED knows
what's going to happen and I don't think
the
I don't think anybody knows anything
honestly I don't know why anything works
but I've decided not to panic about this
brixley
because I don't understand it
in this I mean I understand it in the
broad sense but I don't think anybody
knows how any of this plays out
because people are still going to want
dollars if they think the United States
is still the most stable country
and unless we spend ourselves into
Oblivion which looks like we're on the
way to do that
um
you know it makes me wonder if
in a situation in which debt is possible
does every successful company go
bankrupt because they just borrow until
it's too much
because it feels like that would be a
natural way that life would always go
because the government has trouble
saying no because every every individual
decision is just well I'm only adding
one percent to the debt then the next
Congress says well I'm only adding one
percent and pretty soon you're crushed
it feels like there's nothing that would
stop any country who could borrow
from borrowing too much in the long run
feels like that just would always happen
so I don't know what's going to happen
maybe we'll have to go crypto and
start all over or something
so Rasmussen did some polling on what
would happen if DeSantis run ran as VP
for Trump
do you think that's an option
what do you think DeSantis has a VP for
Trump do you think it could ever happen
well my initial thought was it could not
happen because he's too too strong of a
politician
but also that uh
you don't need Florida do you don't we
assume that Trump would win Florida
pretty easily at this point
so if you don't need Florida I don't
know if
that makes as much sense to get a vice
president like that however you should
be interested now to know
that uh Trump and descentesis as a
package
would handily beat Biden and Harris
based on current polling
and do better than Trump without
DeSantis
so the Rasmussen results show the adding
adding DeSantis would strengthen the
ticket
and it was strengthened apparently
across almost every demographic which is
interesting
does that sound right
do you think Adam DeSantis would
strengthen the ticket across every
demographic
I feel like it might yeah
although I'm kind of confused though are
there really that many Democrats
let's say who think that DeSantis is the
safe one and Trump's the bad one
maybe maybe Floridians
um
I'm going to say I don't think it's
going to happen
it's interesting to look at it but I
don't think that's going to happen
well Nordstrom in San Francisco closed
because of rampant criminal activity
and that follows the closure as let's
say Whole Foods Walgreens
and other stores
but I'm not so sure that's why Nordstrom
closed
because the Nordstrom in my town also
closed and we had no rampant criminal
activity
I feel like it might be a Nordstrom
problem that they might be blaming on
crime
now I'm sure that they also had a big
crime problem but given that their other
store closed without any crime at all
just down the street
I don't know I don't think it's all
crime
uh no not all of Nordstrom's the San
Francisco one
uh was San Francisco the original
Nordstrom I can't remember
all right let's talk about Tucker
Carlson
so as many people have noted there seems
to be some kind of full full court press
attack on Tucker
some of it is by his old enemies who
just want to paint him as a bad person
so a lot of it is just Revenge because
you know Tucker has been a big critic of
the news
so if you're a big critic of places like
the New York Times And The Washington
Post
what should you think when they attack
him
does it sound like news
he literally every night would make fun
of the the entities that are now
attacking
I don't think you can believe anything
in the news about Tucker Carlson
because it's all reported by literally
by his his enemies
how would you believe that
but I'd like to say a few things
so there's some that message that
surfaced in which Tucker was talking
about some video he saw
uh I don't know when but there was some
Mega headed guys beating up an antifa
person
and since it was I don't know three out
of one or something it was a crowd
beating one person
Tucker said in his message that's not
how white men fight
and so the New York Times and all of his
enemies have decided that's racist
it's racist that's not how white men
fight
now I'd like to say two things about
this number one
let's do the Ellen dershowitz shoe on
the other foot test she won the other
foot
imagine if you will
that a black man some prominent black
man could be in the news or anywhere
else who was known to have sent a
private message private just like
Tuckers and said that that's not how
black men fight
what do we be talking about it
no
nobody would care
if a black man if a black man said of
any situation that's not how black black
men fight
nobody would even think twice
how about hispanic
Hispanic American
if in a private message they said that's
not how Hispanics fight
would you care
wouldn't even register with me
How about if it was a woman
and a woman said that's not how women
fight
nothing
Asian American let's just go right down
the list Asian American would
anybody care what an Asian American said
about how they fight compared to other
groups nope nobody cares
why why do they care when Tucker said it
because they're racists it's obviously
just a racist attack against Tucker and
other white people let's be honest it's
an attack on white people
it's just an attack on white people
that's all this is with Tucker being the
focus of it in this case
now I'd like to reinforce something I
tweeted the other day and do you
remember I tweeted the other day a
cryptic message and people said what's
that related to it doesn't seem to be
connected to any current event and my
message was this before the Tucker thing
just like a day before
I said if somebody publishes a private
message
the person who publishes it is
responsible for his content
because you're taking it to a new field
and communication changes very
fundamentally when you change his
context
and so the way you talk to a child is
different than you talk to an adult the
way you talk to your boss is different
than a stranger the way you talk in
private is different than the way you
talk
somewhere else
I don't believe you can be racist in
private
if you're talking to somebody who
doesn't mind what you're saying
that's closer to a thought crime
we don't punish people for their
thoughts
and that's kind of what a private
message is it's a lot closer to a
thought than it is to here's the message
I want the world to hear which could or
could not be racist but a private
message no the New York Times is
responsible for it and they're
racist
because they're only attacking him
because he's white and it's easy it's
easy to demonstrate I just did because
if you change the ethnicity of who said
it nobody would care
is only because he's white
all right so
so I guess I'll get canceled for that
tomorrow
for being a white nationalist so if you
don't know how the ecosystem works of
cancellation
if you've got a sketchy
a sketchy little claim like this private
text message from a Tucker It's kind of
it's not quite you can't quite make it
racist
but if you have to make something that
isn't really racist into something that
really is how would you do it
do you know what the process is
well the process is is very much like
the worsened Watergate guy
you know how CNN brings out the worse
than water gay guy whatever Trump does
something that's just so he'll say in
live TV
uh that's worse than Watergate Bernstein
right it's his only purpose so when this
Tucker thing happens
and he says this thing that some people
would say was racist but not really
what do they do they have an attorney
racist right they got to turn the story
into something
so they call Jonathan greenblatt
he also came after me with he had
absolutely nothing but didn't stop him
damn I'm just a white nationalist
because he's a racist obviously he's a
racist and uh so they bring him out to
talk about Tucker they call him a white
nationalist
so if you see Jonathan Greenblatt that
means the claim is so weak that they
needed to get somebody who would say
you're a racist because other people
wouldn't say it like serious people
wouldn't say it
so he's when you see Bernstein or
Greenblatt that's your uh that's a big
flag for fake news
all right
um I would like to so I tweeted this I
haven't seen the answers I would like
someone in public
to say that they were offended by
Tucker's comment personally
now we all like to get offended on
behalf of other people
which is not a bad impulse I think it's
good that we have a sort of a reflex to
protect you know marginalized people
but I don't think any marginalized
people were offended
do you
do you think you could find me one black
American who is offended by Tucker's
government
I don't think so
I don't think so
anyway
it also seemed like he was criticizing
the white people in the video
because he was saying that's not how
white people
fight I mean there's two ways to take
that but at least one way to take it is
that he doesn't want to be part of a
group that would do that
so it's like a criticism of his own
group
you saw that right
so he's being blamed to be a he's being
called a racist because he criticized
his own group
it's so ridiculous but so typical
all right
um apparently Tucker's departure has
caused a
ratings catastrophe at Fox I don't know
if it's a catastrophe but you know the
people on social media are trying to act
like it's a pretty big deal
um but in the 25 to 54 demographic
um
I saw one tweet that said Hannity is
below 100 below a hundred thousand
viewers in the key demographic that
would be amazing amazingly bad if that's
true I don't know if it's true
and that Tucker's old time slot lost
more than 70 percent of its young
audience
now I don't know if that's permanent
that could be like a little protest
situation if they put somebody who is
kind of a you know a star in that spot I
think it'd probably recover
but
at the moment they took a pretty big hit
so in conjunction with this story I saw
the the ratings of all the shows all the
new shows and all the news networks
and the number one and two shell by far
the number one show was the five
also on Fox so even though Tucker is
gone the number one show
still on Fox The Five
the number does anybody know what the
number two show on Fox's most recently
what do you think is the number two show
it's got felt
what what do the five
and Gutfeld have in common
the two top rated shows
and guffeld
do you think anybody of fox has noticed
wait a minute looking at our ratings
there's something
there's something we're noticing a
pattern here
so I don't know I mean I'm not sure how
important that is to the world except to
Fox News and to uh guffeld but you can't
kill it harder than that
can you talk and talk about somebody
who's just slaying
this is just crazy to have the two to be
um a key part of the two set two biggest
shows
uh yeah I worry that I worry that
Garfield will be the next Target
but he does not do the same kind of
controversial things and when he does
he's always just kidding so it comes
across differently
yeah well we'll see what happens
well in the news allegedly and I'm going
to put a big allegedly on this one a the
ukrainians attacked Putin's residence in
the Kremlin to try to assassinate him
but the Kremlin cleverly shut down those
those two drones and stop the attack
do you think that's true
I don't believe any of it yeah yeah
now
it wouldn't surprise me and by the way
I've already seen a deep fake of the
Kremlin shooting down a drone
and I don't think that the people who
looked at it knew it was a deep fake
unless it's real I don't think it's real
but I don't think anybody actually you
know had a camera already focused and
exactly when the Drone got taken down if
that's what happened yeah now I also it
seems like it would be a drone swarm if
they were really trying to take him out
not two drones so I'm not sure if any
drones were there I'm not sure if um oh
the first question I'd ask is in the
context of a war
would Putin be sleeping in his official
residence
wouldn't that be the worst thing to do
if you're at War
I feel like
nobody would ever know where he is
that would be you'd be sort of like
Saddam Hussein
so I doubt everything about this story
who wants to bet it gets debunked
because Russia is the one that claims
Ukraine did it so it's the lowest level
of credibility you could ever have
and there wasn't much damage so
looks like propaganda to me probably
and I
I have predicted I predicted that
Ukraine would take a run at Moscow and
would take a run at Putin because why
wouldn't that
that's not illegal is it
there's nothing illegal about a country
at War trying to take out the leader of
the other country I think that's that's
part of the war
so why aren't they doing that every day
I feel like Ukraine should be sending a
a drone into the Kremlin every day
because the Kremlin would send the Drone
into Kiev every day
and do right so why can't you send
drones into Moscow every day is it
because you're afraid of nuclear war
if they're not already having a nuclear
war I'm not sure how much worse they can
get
worried about escalation
I don't know we'll see but I don't
believe that story
all right uh Matt gason AOC have teamed
up among some other people in a
non-partisan attempt to try to get uh
Congress banned from the ability to buy
individual stocks so that they can't get
rich trading stocks and apparently it's
just really obvious that there's insider
trading going on just massively
now the problem is I don't know how you
can stop it
because it's too easy for the Insiders
to Simply tell somebody else to buy the
stock
now they might try to stop a family
member
you know like an immediate family member
so you can't do it with your spouse for
example but what about
what about their cousins and their
friends
what about you just say hey cousin Bob I
got a hot stop stock tip for you if you
make a fortune
maybe you consider buying my house for
too much you know something like that so
you can work out all kinds of deals
where they they still get the uh the
benefit of the trade without being the
one who made the trade
so it's really tough to stop but at
least you can stop the easy stuff
because there may be enough members of
Congress who are not clever so they
don't know how to do a whole Biden crime
family thing they only know how to trade
stocks
so it might stop the dumb ones
but it's not going to stop the clever
ones
apparently the Bud Light so-called
boycott is working and that Bud Light
sales are way down
um
does anybody care
butt wipe instead of Bud Light
yeah nobody cares I'm not
again I am so not in favor of this
boycott
you can do whatever you want and I'm not
sure it's called the boycott maybe it's
not a boycott maybe it's just a whole
bunch of people who are individually
registering their displeasure you know
which is
sums up to a boycott but I feel like
it's less about an organized boycott
than it is to just a bunch of people who
don't want to be associated with the
brand anymore
but imagine how much teasing you would
get if you showed up with a Bud Light in
your hand
s
that's the problem if you it makes me
want to drink it you know I don't drink
don't drink alcohol but if I did you
know I would bring a Bud Light to a
party
I hope you know that about me oh I would
so bring a Bud Light to a party if I
drank
yeah because it'd be funny it'd just get
people talking and you know blah blah
blah
all right so
I guess that's happened
do you feel let me ask you this do you
feel that there is a
the woke backlash is bigger than the
wokeness yet
or am I in a bubble it seems like
here's what's different
I noticed that the a lot of the hosts on
Fox News are calling trans women men
and I don't know that that would have
happened
two years ago
one year ago
but have you noticed that shift
that that there are you know
conservative names who are willing to
just say that's a man
Jordan Peterson the same thing you say
yeah I I feel like
there are enough people who have raised
their head out of the Foxhole
that there might be a little bit of a
shift coming because these things never
last forever there's a there should be
at some point
you know there's going to be a slide
back to the middle I think I mean that
would be the most logical uh predictable
thing to happen
so yeah I think there's a lot happening
there I think people are able to talk
more freely in a way all right here's my
favorite uh parlor game with CNN
it goes like this
the headline of CNN says there's a new
study or a new drug or a new thing
that they think might be causing some
benefits or they found something that
causes something else
and here's what I do I count the number
of paragraphs before the story is
debunked in the in its own story right
so so here's the headline
uh
regular internet use may be linked to
lower dementia risk in older adults
study says
and I'm like wow
that would be pretty good because if
that were true then that would be a real
practical thing for keeping your brain
active you'd say hey Grandma
you know you should use the internet
more I'll send you some email let me
show you how to browse Instagram and
then you'd have a like a real functional
cheap way to help people's cognition
so I start counting the paragraphs one
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen sixteenth the 16th paragraph
says
uh
one of the research people says but we
wouldn't want to read too much into this
study in isolation it doesn't establish
cause of effect
there's one study and it doesn't
establish cause and effect
now what do you think is more likely
I'll just ask you common sense if you
have any common sense
is it more likely
that using the internet protects your
brain which I think it might
or
that people who have the the best brains
are most most likely to use the internet
which do you think is more likely
don't you think that the smartest most
active brains which you would predict
would be continue to be the the best
brains I mean if your brain is already
good
you're probably going to use the
internet if your brain has already
slowed down
you're probably not going to figure out
how to use email
so this is the most one of the most
obvious reverse
causation
things you could ever see
and but that does not eliminate the
possibility it could work both ways
right
it makes perfect sense that it would
work both ways the the best brains are
most likely to use the internet when
they're old but also any form of
intellectual activity is probably good
for your brain it's just that the study
didn't tease out any of that
just none of it you can't tell
so do you know how many times I've done
that with CNN
now to their credit they do say may be
linked to lower dementia but nobody
reads them maybe
you read a little link to the Moon you
read the first three paragraphs and you
say I better put grandma on the internet
and maybe you should for other reasons
but yeah it's a little bit leading the
witness here leading the witness
[Applause]
all right it seems to me
that the news got really slow going to
make some observations
when I first started talking about the
headlines
2016 or so
I would uh go to CNN and see what they
had to say and I would go to Fox News
and see what they had to say and it
would be real interesting because they'd
cover the same story but like completely
different filter on the story
but today is really different
today the you know the one or two
biggest stories will be covered by both
entities but 80 percent of the news on
Fox News is not even on CNN and vice
versa they don't cover the same news
so it's an entirely set of different
directions about what is news
so I can't even do the
um which so I can't even do the
comparison of oh here's what CNN says
and here's what Fox News says because
it's different news just completely
different and that's
that's really changed
all right so the writers are on strike
um
but do we know I guess the view used
writers
did you know that
did you know that the show The View used
writers now obviously that writers for
the introductions
but what else do they have a writer for
after you do the introduction
and Whoopi was apologizing she said
maybe their commentary would not be as
crisp as as usual
Maybe
um
so I I think
that that would also be a reason why the
shows the five and garfeld will probably
even game ground in the next few weeks
if the if the strike continues because
those are both based almost entirely
well I won't say that but mostly those
shows are based on the individuals
coming up with stuff on the spot
with a little bit of preparation
I paved the way for Tucker I don't think
so
Union rules mandate writers whether you
need them or not oh is that true
you have to have a writer even if you're
not using them
Maybe
have I ever told you my most annoying uh
uh writer's Union story
so I was a member of the S The Writer's
Guild
and uh Screen Actors Guild and that too
for a while so when I was writing
scripts for the Dilbert TV show that ran
for a few half seasons on UPN
um
I would write a first draft
and hand it off to a writer or I'd you
know maybe outline the story and then a
writer would handle it so I would get I
would get right in credit for the first
draft and then whoever did the teleplay
or the Finish finish part they get
credit for that that part and then the
the union rules would specify how much I
got paid as the first draft guy and how
much they got paid for finishing it
well
uh
there were also there are also rules
that if you rewrite somebody's work it's
they still get paid
so here's what would happen a number of
times I'd give the writers the outline
so that makes me the author of the of
the the work
and then they'd write something and I'd
throw the entire thing away because it
wasn't a single line of it that I could
use
and I would write the whole thing from
scratch
so it was my framework my first draft
and my finished work so there was not a
single word of any other writer on it
although I usually worked with my
co-executive producer so he would be
also a credit
but the do you know who got paid
not me
no the people who got paid were the ones
who wrote the stuff I threw away
because the union rules say that who
whoever does the bulk of the writing
gets the credit
and if you later edit it
you don't get credit for that it's still
their writing
even if there's nothing left I literally
literally just put the whole thing in
the trash
started from scratch
so I still see things that I wrote
completely with other people's names on
them when I say the credits do you know
how much that bothers me
it bothers me a lot there's no real it's
not much money involved but uh
if you're a writer and you see somebody
else's name on your work and you know
that they get a check for it it makes
you crazy it just makes you crazy
all right uh a Dilbert contest on locals
what would that be
all right now is there anything else
that uh I haven't mentioned if you were
a member of the
Scott
adams.locals.com
subscription Community tonight you would
be participating in a book club review
of my book God's debris
and the religion War
now if you've not heard of these books
um
well let me do it this way
for those who have heard of the books
give your opinion in the comments
so most especially on YouTube
for the benefit of anybody else who
wonders what's going on so those books
are not like ordinary books they they
change people people become different
after they they read them especially
God's debris that's what they tell me
they they tell you know change their
life
Etc and I hear that all the time
um
so we're gonna have a book discussion on
locals but that's just for subscribers
they have bad titles I don't know I
think God's debris is the best title the
other one maybe not but what's
interesting about the religion war is
that it was written in
2003 or four
and it anticipated today
so it was a it was about the future but
the future is right now
so part of that future was uh big data
and AI
less AI than big data
um
and drone attacks on major cities
so those are you know two big themes
yeah all right
um
I don't think it would benefit younger
people more
yeah God's degree is is popular with 14
year olds and up
tiny bombs
why is it okay to cancel a Dilbert but
not Bud Light well it's not okay in
either case
King Charles coronation boring
Kamala is holding your White House AI
meeting are you serious
you know a couple you know what's funny
if Kamala Harris is holding an AI
meeting at the White House
she's actually the job you could most
easily replace with AI
how long would it take AI to learn to
giggle over a Venn diagram
not long at all
yeah I mean I I can't think of any job
that would be easier to replace than the
vice president I mean I realize we have
a constitutional problem if we do that
but that would be the easiest one
it makes you wonder if it's a deep fake
or the real Cobble having that meeting
I wonder how she ever shows up on time
for a meeting
what time is the meeting
three o'clock
in the context of time in the
contextualized period of the passage of
time which is this moment
and then she misses the meeting
yeah she's the borders are
I'm starting to think Zara means
nothing's going to happen
is it just my imagination or have none
of our czars
yeah they all end up like
Anastasia all of us ours get murdered by
Bolsheviks basically
um John Kerry well we see at the czarov
drugs
yeah we didn't we need a new czar
all right
um there's no other news today so I
think I'm going to do something else
unless there's something else I should
be talking about
did I miss anything
it's really all about wondering if our
client if our economy is going to be
destroyed on its own right
well what would you say is the biggest
issue right now in terms of the risk to
the country
what do you feel is our biggest risk
that
socialism that Biden Denison wokism
inflation housing inflation
yeah
yeah inflation is going to be pretty big
and what about AI taking jobs
do you worry about AI taking jobs
I feel like that's going to be slower
than it looks
there'll be there'll be some areas like
but it's not huge Industries
economic collapse
yeah
so nobody said nuclear war
nobody said nuclear war and climate was
almost not mentioned
uh border
I don't know if that's the biggest
problem is border the biggest problem I
mean it's a big problem but elections
yeah guns
I know I would I would say uh the health
of the economy but I'm also concerned
about Taiwan
if you had to guess what are the odds of
China actually making a military move on
Taiwan let's say in a year within the
next year
so why are you worried about that
wouldn't that be catastrophic
here's where I think I think China
doesn't like to do catastrophic things
that China doesn't act like Russia does
Russia will roll the dice
well you know we've seen Putin do it
Russia will take a chance to gain
another country or to gain some
territory or to gain something China
doesn't take those kind of chances
so it would seem out of character to try
to take Taiwan
now here's my question does Taiwan make
chips for China as well
they do right
I would imagine Taiwan is their biggest
do they not know that we would destroy
the
I shouldn't say this
I shouldn't say this out loud you you
know those chip manufacturing plants are
never going to go to China right
let me let me just do the Joe Biden uh
Grim when he talks about the the
Nordstrom pipeline well how is that
Nordstrom pipeline going to stop pumping
stuff to Russia
we'll do it
trust me we'll take care of the
Nordstrom pipeline
don't you think it's the same with those
the the chip companies I think the chip
companies would just get
whacked
by Friendly Fire
and and I think that the day that an
invasion started
this is my guess
the day that an invasion started
there would be some kind of American
vessel parked nearby in which every chip
scientist and their extended family
would be getting a free trip to America
I feel like we would steal their people
and rebuild rebuild over here and we
would and we would probably have enough
warning before shots were fired that
there would be this whole sea of people
who would just run out to the beach and
start getting on boats and head to
America
just like we did with the German rocket
scientists exactly that is that that is
a model I was thinking of but we'd have
to take their families
which would be fine I mean if you get a
bunch of
chip scientists employees I think I do
want their families if you know what I
mean you're going to get some really
high achieving people
if you if you take taiwan's best
scientists and their families because
the family you get that's like you're
almost guaranteed to get good citizens
and of you know chip scientists families
all right so
I feel as if
um China wants Taiwan for all the
reasons they want it historically and
because it's too close to their border
and their Chinese speaking and all the
reasons but I don't think that they want
to start a war that would eliminate
chips
I think the last thing that China wants
to do is not have any microchips
so I don't think they're gonna so I'm
gonna go with will not attack Taiwan in
the next year
how many would agree with me
in the will not attack in the next year
who knows after that
yeah
see I think the the Assumption of an
attack
I think imagines that the chip business
would still be in business when they
took it over
and I think that's the wrong assumption
all right okay ladies and gentlemen
uh once Russia wraps up Ukraine they
will
so I I saw a news story that we've
shipped massive amounts of ammunition to
Ukraine in anticipation of their spring
offensive
and that sounds like that's true right
you imagine that we've sent tons of ammo
and they're just waiting for their
so-called spring offensive
and then I saw that one of the things
that the ukrainians did was they took
all that ammo and they put them in a few
easily identified places where Russia
has already blown it up
is that true
I feel like maybe they're already out of
ammo this could be the only War where
neither side has ammo
because I don't think we've ever had as
good an ability because of our drones
and our satellites we've never had this
much ability to know where the the
weapons Depots are right
I feel like we know
where every one of Russia's ammo Depots
is but they also probably know where
every one of Ukraine's MO deposes
and if you've got weapons that can go
off into deep territory and strike at
pinpoint
aren't both of them going to run out of
ammo
because it seems to me would be the
easiest thing in the world to spot their
ammo dumps once the firing starts
because they're going to need to you
know make a lot of Runs put them on
trains I mean it's really easy to spot
and if you know where it is and you have
weapons like the high Mars aren't the
high marks going to take out all the
weapons depots
on both sides I mean whatever Russian's
version of that is
yeah because the the Depots are the
things you can't move
everything else can you know you can
maybe move out of the way and they don't
know where you are any minute of the day
and
but it's pretty hard to move those
weapons depots
yeah they can't easily be dispersed that
would be inefficient
you spread out ammo once you get inside
the range of the high Mars well you
spread it out but you don't allocate it
ahead of time I mean maybe a smaller
ammo dumps but they should be able to
get them all
put them underground
yeah
then we just
yeah probably underground but we know
that they weren't putting a lot of them
on the ground even though that seems
obvious to us so
uh all right
their inventory is mostly on trucks
oh Amazon is developing an improved llm
to power
a-l-e-x-a good
good
all right
um ladies and gentlemen I'm going to say
bye to YouTube thanks for joining
maybe tomorrow will be less more fun
news bye for now
