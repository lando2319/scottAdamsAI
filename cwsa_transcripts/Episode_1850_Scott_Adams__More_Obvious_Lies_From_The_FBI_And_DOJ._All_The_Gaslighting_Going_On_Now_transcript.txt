everybody
welcome
to the best place on earth
the highest point of human civilization
coffee with scott adams and it doesn't
get better than this
no
it does get better than this and all you
have to do is add the simultaneous sip
to an already
extremely exciting situation
and all you need to do that is a copper
mug a glass of tanker jealous just died
a canteen drug or flask of vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called
simultaneous sip
it happens now go
um
so erica is hard at work
organizing the design of the coffee with
scott adams simultaneous sip coffee mug
and once that's done
i guess you'll all have a chance to get
one
now
let me tell you my feeling about
merchandise
my feeling about merchandise is it's for
the benefit of the
people who want it it's it's not like a
way to make money but if you want it
i think it's fun to have so
i'm excited to uh
to see what the group comes up with over
on locals
all right
to me the most interesting story this
just continues is that bill maher
interview with rob reiner
and i had to watch it again
because it's really interesting to watch
it live when you read about it
and you just see the quotes
it really doesn't capture the enormity
of the moment
and the enormity of the moment is that
it captured everything that's wrong
with all of the political conversation
because there was somebody who was a big
rob reiner a prominent um
democrat voice
specifically an anti-trump voice and
and there was a major news story you
know the suppression of the hunter
laptop
that he was completely unaware of
i mean that's a big big story
to be completely unaware of that means
you don't really understand anything
that's going on
because if you don't know that your own
government would not only suppress that
but admit it and the news would say yeah
we did that they probably shouldn't have
done that but we did that
they just admitted
and he and and he questioned whether
that is a known fact
and bill maher had to had to tell him
it's not only a known fact they've
confessed
they confessed
the people who did it say they did it
and rob ryder didn't know
so
um i give bill maher uh a plus for
asking the question
but he still fell
just short
of the real question
so the quote the way he asked bill maher
was
you know if trump is so dangerous is it
true that anything would be justified to
keep him out of office
now the anything would be justified
covers
you know the whole range anything
but here's the question you really want
to ask isn't it
if you're a democrat and you think trump
is this dangerous and you had the
ability to rig an election to keep him
out of office
would you do it
and should you do it
see that's the question
because here's the thing that pisses me
off
i personally have no information that
would suggest
the election was rigged in a major way
that i can confirm
so let me say that right off the bat
no court has said that the 2020 election
was illegitimate
and i'm not personally aware of any
information that would change that
assumption
however
however
when people tell me that it's
unreasonable to imagine the election
would be rigged
i can't i can't sit still for that
okay i'm okay when you say the evidence
has not been shown in any conclusive way
okay
okay
but when you go further from that and
say oh that's a ridiculous thing to
imagine that an election could be rigged
under these conditions
under these conditions it would be
ridiculous to imagine it wasn't
am i wrong
the the the baseline assumption is that
under these conditions
these very unique conditions that people
literally think that hitler was going to
be re-elected
under those conditions you need to prove
you didn't rig the election
am i wrong
if if all of the reasons suggest you
should
and you're probably able i don't know
that for sure but
one imagines that if you worked at it
you could find some way to read an
election you might have to get more
people in on it to cover it up but one
imagines is possible
right i haven't heard anybody argue
that rigging an election can't be done
under any situation
i've only heard somebody say
they believe it wasn't done
but nobody said
it can't be done
under all scenarios there's just no way
to do it nobody said that
and so isn't the most reasonable
assumption
that in this specific situation where
the people running the elections
believed they could save the world
by rigging the election
the assumption has to be that if they
did
the assumption has to be that they did
because the the opposite assumption is
actually nonsensical
it would be like
i know how much you like analogies
because they're so persuasive
i'm not even going to bother
i'm just saying that if you start with
the assumption that trump is what you
think he is
it would be ridiculous to imagine that
the election was not rigged to prevent
him from office that would be a
ridiculous assumption
now if if somebody couldn't figure out
how to do it or they were afraid of
getting caught all that would that would
hold them back
but it's ridiculous to imagine
that under this specific set of
assumptions
that trump is so dangerous it's
ridiculous to assume that they didn't at
least look into it
am i right
do you think nobody looked into it
do you think there was no democrat
involved in any election
process who didn't say to themselves you
know
hypothetically
i'm not saying i'll do it
but
if we're just doing a
sort of a mental exercise here
um you know could do it this way maybe
well let's talk about the fbi brand
talk about timing
have you noticed that timing
is the most important thing all the time
like if the energy is just right
for the thing that happens then then it
takes off
but look at this timing
so you remember the the nexium alleged
uh sex cult situation there was a
subgroup
of nexium that was a alleged sex cult
and their leader went to jail and fbi
were involved in putting that case
together
and now there's an ex-fbai agent this is
not the newest of news but
it's worth resurfacing
so this ex-fbi agent looked at the
evidence that convicted the head of this
group
keith ranieri
and decided that one of the photographs
on his on the laptop
reneri's laptop
that it was uh the date had been altered
and that the day had been altered to
make it seem as if the picture had been
taken
at a time that would prove that keith
renery was doing
uh having sex with an underage
girl 17 i think or 15 whatever it was
now
separate from the question of whether
any of those things happened
is the question of whether any evidence
was rigged
or or faked
so there's an ex-fbi agent who looked at
it and said oh yeah this is definitely
faked
because he just looks at the file and
looks at the file name and apparently
there's some way to know when it got
changed or the date got changed
now here's the question
is an ex-fbi agent who's accusing
current fbi agents i believe or at least
law enforcement
so there's only one of two possibilities
either law enforcement lied
or an ex-fbi agent is incompetent or
lied
neither of those things is good for law
enforcement
because either the current
bunch are lying or incompetent
or this ex-sbi agent who wasn't x that
long ago
is also incompetent or lying
but whichever way you look at it there's
somebody involved with law enforcement
who definitely is incompetent or lying
that's the one thing you can say about
the nexium case no matter what keith
renery did or didn't do
the one thing we can know for sure
is that people recently associated with
the fbi and law enforcement are
definitely incompetent or lying we just
don't know which ones
we don't know which ones that's it
but we don't have to wonder
about the quality of the
the people in the organization that that
part's been answered
uh let me let me do something that
maybe is a little counter to what's been
going on
i keep hearing people say oh we're only
talking about the leadership of the fbi
and the department of justice we're not
trying to impugn the integrity of the
rank and file people who are just
patriots and doing their job as best
they can
i'm not going to get on that train
nope
nope if you work for an organization
where the top of the organization is
corrupt
you've got something to do about that
leave the organization or be a
whistleblower or work on fixing it but
you don't get a pass
you don't get a pass
i'm certainly willing to say that the
ranking file committed no crimes
are we all okay with that
most of the rank and file committed no
crimes
but you're not off the hook
you're not off the hook if i belong to
an organization that's doing horrible
things and i continue to
be part of the organization i'm not
innocent
i'm not innocent
if i willingly am supporting that group
that's doing terrible things
i think the rank and file need to do
something on their own
maybe police their own do whatever do
whatever it takes but i think they're in
an unfortunate situation through no
fault of their own
their brand is being tarnished
but
it's still their responsibility
even though they're even though they're
under
you know the lower ranked people it's
still their responsibility
all right
so uh biden has referred to
the ultra mega people as semi-fascist
and so i looked up
definition of fascist to figure out what
semi-fascist would be
and fascist would be the government
controls industry
basically right
that's when the government is control of
the private businesses so they're not
exactly private because the government
controls them
and that the government suppresses
freedoms etc
so what would be semi-fascist
well full fascist is completely
controlling industry
semi-fascists would be partially
controlling industry
right
that's just what semi means
you know you're not completely
controlling industry you're you're semi
controlling them
what political group
would be most associated with a semi
trying to control
uh industry
would it be the ones who want to remove
regulations
or the people who want to put on
regulations well i would say the people
putting on regulations are trying to
control them
democrats
would it be the people who are
increasing the taxes on these businesses
or the ones who are decreasing the taxes
well i'd say the ones controlling them
are the ones increasing the
taxes the ones not controlling them are
the ones saying you don't need to give
us any taxes and do what you want
how about if you were trying to make
industry comply with
esg
the idea that industries should pollute
less and
be better for the environment and have
more diverse
governance and governorship governor
governorship
they should be governed by more diverse
boards etc
where does that come from is that coming
from republicans
or is it coming from
left-leaning people it's left leading
people
so if you were to look at fascist means
completely controlling
the industry
semi-fascist would be
partly controlling the industry there's
no question that's the democrats
is it
i mean to me it looks exactly like
they're trying to control industry
but that's not all
so being a fascist would also be trying
to
control free speech
which uh which group is more associated
with not eliminating free speech
but really reducing it you know
semi-fascist full fascist would be no
free speech
semi-fascists would be well
you're not going to go to jail
necessarily
but we might take away your social media
access so you can't be heard
semi-fascist
am i wrong
that half fascist
describes the democrats
fairly accurately
right now and i'm not trying to make a
republican versus democrat you know
partisan
point i'm just saying
how do word what do words mean
it's just what words mean right
and it's amazing that fascist has turned
into like such a non-word that you can
use it in any context
it's like the insult that you can use
any time
what do you mean
uh you're out of coffee
you fascist you just throw it in
anywhere
all right
uh mike cernovich continues to be
provocative
i don't know if he knows how to not be
provocative
but uh he tweeted that he wouldn't be
interested in um
mountain climbing because it would be
too easy for the deep state to make him
disappear
and people said what
what
he actually thinks the deep state
might try to murder him
if he you know had it had some kind of a
hobby that would make it easy to murder
him
now uh
he
you went further on another tweet
because people questioned that of course
and he said quote to kill me or frame me
for a crime
the deep state only has to be lucky once
i have to be lucky every day
the pressure would break most people i
don't wish it on anyone
for me it's good
keeps me away from sinful behavior and
requires vigilance how we should all
live
now what do you think
is that hyperbole
do you think that mike cernovich
specifically
not talking generally just specifically
do you think that mike cernovich has a
risk
of being murdered or taken out let's say
by scandal or some kind of allegation or
legal process do you think the deep
state is trying to take mike's run image
out
there was a time that i would have
scoffed at this
there was a time i would have said
nobody's trying to take you out
but now i would say this is a reasonable
it's a reasonable take
yeah
i i think that
um it's it seems obvious
that
influential voices
uh who are more associated with the
right i'm not sure if he would even
identify that way but people that other
people associated with the right
are all being targeted are they not
so he's definitely being targeted
you don't think that if um the left had
a way to put ceramics in jail you don't
think that they'd
chase that
of course they would because every time
you take a voice off the
you know you take a piece off the
chessboard
you get a little advantage
and it looks like they do just about
anything
for advantage
all right so what about me
do you think i have been or will be a
target
to be taken out by the media or deep
state
here's the difference between
cernovich and me on this topic
i also believe that
i'm on the target list
so so there's no doubt that people who
are prominent in the democratic party
have wondered how to take me out would
you say that's fair
they're probably people who have you
know worked on the question of how to
take me out
i think that's fair
you're definitely going to see some kind
of major hit piece in a big publication
between now and december or between now
and elections
probably before the presidential
elections because i don't have that much
influence on the congressional stuff
now here's the thing
i'm not worried about them taking me out
do you know why i'm not worried
you know i am not worried about the deep
state taking me
out because it's already factored in
i think it's going to happen
i don't know how i mean i i would guess
against murder
i doubt i'll be killed
but maybe who knows
um but
i think my fate is to go down hard
i suspect
that you know my my story ends in flames
i've always assumed i would probably be
assassinated
but
it's that's factored in
so my my actions are not going to be
changed by that because i don't think i
can change it
i think i end poorly
one way or the other i just don't know
when
but
it does feel like you know
it does feel like i'm not going to go to
i'm not going to make it all the way
so i do think that it's a dangerous kind
of thing that cernovich does
and a dangerous thing that i do
but uh he's got kids and you know he
needs to stay alive
and i'm a little more uh
i think i'm more a little more willing
to go
i wouldn't mind going for a good reason
you know
i suppose if i got murdered but it made
my messages
uh
take on a bigger life that might be good
never know anyway i don't want to go
fully dark but we do live in a world
where
a prominent voice worried about getting
taken out you have to think that's real
i think that's real
now i don't know what my odds are but
i've just factored that into the into my
decision
speaking of that sort of thing lindsey
graham has said in a video he's on video
saying that there'd be riots in the
street if trump is prosecuted
this is being interpreted by the left as
an effort to encourage political
violence
everything is upside down and backwards
yes is no
black is white
wet is dry
there's nothing you can say
that someone will won't look at it and
say well i conclude the opposite
it seems to me
that lindsey graham is trying to
decrease violence
by warning that
prosecuting him now keep in mind
that lindsey graham is working from
current information
our current information is that there's
no crime
to prosecute trump
so under the current situation that
there's no crime
if trump gets prosecuted yeah there
would be a pretty big public reaction
so don't you think it's a good idea to
not prosecute an ex-president unless
there's an actual crime and evidence
i mean so so he's talking kind of
hypothetically so to imagine that this
is
promoting violence
do you think that nobody would have
thought of rioting in the streets unless
lindsey graham had mentioned it
do you think the militias are all there
oh we we weren't going to activate but
lindsey graham said something on that
video once
so we better do it
i don't think it works that way
i feel like lindsey graham is simply
describing the situation
if you imagine he's causing the
situation
you're not really
understanding the nature of anything
lindsey graham can't cause this
he's just describing it
what do you think
what do you think about the the truth of
it
if trump gets
let's say prosecuted
do you think there will be riots in the
street
yes or no
riots in the street if he gets
prosecuted
yes or no
oh this is interesting it's mostly nose
mostly nose
there are some yeses
but way more no's
now why do you say that
see it's a trick question it's actually
a terrible question that's a very unfair
question
because you're you're all forced to make
an assumption
if you assume that he was prosecuted for
an actual real crime
well there would be i don't think there
would be riots
let me say the question better
if you believed he was being prosecuted
for an actual crime
a crime you could actually observe
yourself and say oh that's a crime
do you think to be riots if it was an
actual crime that got proven
i think there would be protests but not
a big deal
not a big deal if the case is made
republicans are rule followers
republicans are not going to abandon
everything that they believe most
basically the rule of law
i don't think republicans are going to
abandon the rule of law
for one candidate if they believe the
law has been broken now that
the gray area
is if republicans don't believe he broke
any laws and he's getting prosecuted
anyway
in that case
in that case
if you believed he was unfairly
prosecuted riots or no riots
riots or no riots if he if you believed
he was unfairly prosecuted
riots or no riots
really
people are people are still saying no
riots
unfairly prosecuted no ryans
maybe
wow
you know i i think i'm going to be
influenced by your answers
and now is is the reason just because
republicans don't riot
is that why
yes somebody says that directly
republicans don't riot
huh
yeah you might be right
i'm not going to disagree with you i'm
curious i was curious what you would say
all right
um
here have you ever been frustrated
by the fact that the news is almost
entirely about stuff we don't know
and the press won't even ask the right
questions
at one point i thought that the way i
would
say position myself
in the public
at least in terms of talking about
politics was to be the person who helped
the press ask the right questions
because i'm always frustrated when the
press doesn't ask the right questions
the one i would ask
and so i thought wouldn't it be useful
if there was some kind of
you know public
i don't know process or some kind of
website
where the news media could see what the
public wants them to ask
so you could go there and say oh boy the
public really really wants me to ask
this question it's the one voted to the
top so i'm definitely going to ask that
one first
wouldn't that be helpful
and
think about the things that we don't
know about
the public doesn't really know what we
spend money on
or why because it's too complicated and
the news the news won't even bother
trying to explain it because it's too
complicated so the biggest thing that
the country does is spend money
right all of our priorities our policies
all of our everything
is
is represented by spending money on it
so the most important thing the country
does the public is completely blind
we have we really don't know what is
happening money-wise nobody's watching
the budget
we don't know what any of these
investigations will turn up
so we don't know what uh you know durham
is going to find yet
we had to wait forever for mueller and
then we couldn't agree with what the
what the document said
now we're waiting for this you know
mar-a-lago stuff and we're waiting for
you know some something about trump's
taxes and
we're always waiting for an
investigation to conclude
you can't make any decisions when you're
waiting for stuff to to be known um we
don't know what's in the mar-a-lago
boxes
we don't know what the iran deal looks
like we don't know what was in hillary's
emails we don't know if the ufos are
real or what the government knows about
it
and we don't know how we're going to
ever pay off all our debt national debt
yeah
so
it's
it's really frustrating how many things
we don't know now speaking of the iran
deal
israel basically says they're not going
to sign on to any kind of a deal
that would give iran a path
to a nuclear device
now israel's complaint
is that if iran gets a nuke it will
cause the other nations in the area to
need nukes of their own
so then saudi arabia is going to say
well if you've got nukes we'd better
have some nukes
and then everybody's got nukes and it's
more dangerous
what do you think of that argument
that if iran gives nukes
there the neighboring countries that
maybe are afraid of iran might have to
get some nukes of their own
well
here's what i would do if i were israel
i would try to get the countries that
would consider nukes to actually say
they would build nukes if iran does
wouldn't it be useful for for saudi
arabia to say look we don't want iran to
have a nuke but if they build one we're
definitely building one and here's our
plans
right here's our budget
we've already approved a budget to build
a nuclear program
but if iran doesn't build one we won't
do it either
so here's here's what i think
israel should do for persuasion
they should somehow make visual
the fact that the iran deal is not about
iran
it's about opening up the nuclear box
for all of the middle east
because there's nobody who thinks that a
whole bunch of more nuclear powers in
the middle east is good for anybody
so i think that would be their best play
their best player would say
if you don't stop it in iran it's going
to be everywhere
now of course israel would like to be
the exception and have to have their
nukes with nobody having them
but
yeah i think that's the that's the angle
they have to go for
if if the argument is limited to just
iran getting a nuke
apparently that's not having an
influence on biden
but also what do you think israel is
going to have to do if iran
and the united states and europe come up
with some kind of an iran deal
because israel is not going to sign off
on it no matter what
so it would be a
european american iran deal if there is
one but what do you think israel is
going to do
i think israel would have to
be far more aggressive in destroying
their assets than their scientists
wherever they can find them
so if you assume that israel will not
tolerate a nuclear iran and i don't
think they will
then a
a peace deal with iran guarantees war
doesn't it
i mean a nuclear agreement with man a
nuclear agreement with iran should
guarantee war
not stop it
and israel i think can make that case
plain
look if you make a deal and we're on our
own it's war
i mean it might be a covert war it might
might be entirely deniable kind of war
like oh we don't know why that blew up
but it is war
i mean his full military
blow up kill people war
so i don't think israel is doing a good
job of
laying out the alternative path
the alternative path is
a nuclearized middle east
and war
see i think israel is just
that they don't um they don't help
themselves by being subtle
you know if they say stuff like well you
know we'll have to take
greater action in iran or something like
that just say it's war
just call it what it is
if you make a deal with iran that's war
and we're going to take off we're going
to pull out all the stops
to directly attack iran's
for supporting a nuclear bomb
because you know israel will right
do you think israel is going to go soft
do you think israel would say
well you know we we wanted to stop them
from getting a nuke but
now that now that this deal is signed
we'll just live with it
you think they'll do that
no i think israel's
persuasion game is a little weak right
now which is unusual very unusual
i think they could increase their
persuasion game quite a bit
all right
so i asked this question about voting
here's something i had a big gap in my
knowledge
so for those voting precincts where
everything's on paper
and then they tally up the results
when they transmit their totals to the
big database in the sky that gives you
the total totals
they can check their subtotals got there
correctly right
so in other words do we have to worry
about the
digital
path
from the local precinct to the final
database
because the local precinct can say all
right
yeah we had
x number of votes for biden did it get
recorded that way yep x number of votes
were biden we
so so i think that's probably not a big
risk
because the precincts probably check to
make sure their data got there
if they can and i think they can
and i think it's even public right
it's probably public what the precinct
devoted and then it would be public on
the main database so you can see for
yourself i think
so is the only place that we should be
worried about
digital voting
is where the voting machines themselves
were were tabulating votes at the local
precinct
and then transmitting it digitally is
that the only place that we would have a
question
because i don't know if that even
applies to any of the
battle the battlefield
places does it
are there any battlefield election
locations
where the voting is not done on paper
because i know we do have places where
people vote entirely on digital machines
but i don't know if those are
battleground places are the battleground
places mostly paper
somebody says correct
remember romney got zero votes in some
philadelphia precincts yeah
right
they don't count at the precinct level
what
you're telling your precinct doesn't
count its own votes
are they sent to a center that's counted
so do they physically transport them
before they're counted
oh my god really
[Laughter]
really
i don't believe that
i i don't believe that i don't believe
that paper leaves leaves the facility
uncounted
are you kidding me
all right there's a lot of people who
think that
locally
the votes are taken and you've got the
votes on these ballots on pieces of
paper and that the pieces of paper are
transported to another facility for
counting
they're not counted locally
i guess that makes sense because you
wouldn't want a counting accounting
feature at every little local voting
place okay
i guess i'm i guess i'm going to accept
that because it does make sense that you
wouldn't want
a counting function at every little
local polling place
so
then how would we know if some of it
disappeared
the only way you'd know
well you could you could count the total
number of votes
right
so
would the local precinct at least know
the total number of people who voted
so they would know if the total got
through right
yeah so here's the thing that nobody's
done a good job of explaining to the
public
which is explain the whole process you
know like
as if we're idiots because we are you
know put it in simple terms all right
person votes their piece of paper goes
here it goes in this pile then somebody
batches them up and they put them in
this truck and then the truck goes here
i want it that way
because i want somebody to explain
okay because we check here and we check
here
we can know with certainty that there
was no problem in between
right wouldn't you like to know that
but
because this happens and then this
happens there's still a little bit of
risk here
but we haven't seen any problems but
it's something that's a little bit
non-transparent
wouldn't you like to know that
yeah i guess i realize the process is a
little different in every state but i
think we can get a general
sense at least for the battleground
places how do they even handle it
because it seems to me they're probably
uh local systems that are completely
secure
and i'll bet there are some that aren't
in other words if they all do it
differently
well let's use some common sense
if the if the election processes are
different
at different places
doesn't that pretty much guarantee that
some of them are not good
do you suppose that they use all kinds
of different processes
and they're all just as good
they're all just as good
this seems very unlikely right it seems
to me that the expensive ones are better
and the cheaper ones are worse
probably it's just money
money plus time to implement right
so you would expect if it's like
everything else in the world there's
this big range of very secure to well
we're not so sure
i'd love to know how that breaks down
and whether the battleground states or
even
you know anything we should worry about
i'm on the right trail now somebody says
it's the same trail i've always been on
there's not there's not enough
transparency in the election system for
the for the public to actually have a
reasonable opinion about what happened
yeah i've been saying that the elections
are are not fully auditable
but maybe they're closer to fully
auditable than i know
maybe maybe for example maybe the
battleground places are the most secure
right
if you happen to to be in charge of a
battleground state
don't you think you could get more money
from the state to make sure yours was
done right
you'd say we're the battleground state
we're the most important one give us a
big budget so we do this right because
we don't want any questions in a
battleground state
well
i feel as though
there's a lot to know here
all right
rasmussen asked american adults about
their opinions about the public school
system here
only eight percent of american adults
rated the performance of public schools
excellent
another 22 percent said
good
but generally speaking
it's a lot like people think of congress
if you ask the public
is congress good or bad they'll say uh
disapprove uh congress is bad but then
you say but what about your
representative they'll say well my
representative is pretty good
yeah i got lucky
good thing
uh thing my representative is good
well people say the same thing about
schools
if you ask them if the school systems
are good they're likely to give a
negative answer
but if you ask them if their school is
good they'll say oh my school is pretty
good
but i hear those other schools are
pretty bad
so
now i've told you before that when i i
tell you optimistic stories about
technology
some new invention or breakthrough
you should always take it in the
following way
probably not true
stories about technical and scientific
breakthroughs
are almost never true
i'd say 95 of them are false
but
aren't they fun
when you hear some big breakthrough that
could change the world in a positive way
don't you like to
at least live with the thought that
maybe it could be true
so when i tell you
that there's a new breakthrough which
i'm going to tell you in a moment
if it's true
it's insanely good
it's probably not true
but can we agree to act as though it's
true
because it'll feel good
that's all we're trying to do we're just
trying to feel good all right
well mit the smartest people in the
universe
say they've invented a cheap battery
and what's amazing about it is not just
this maybe one-sixth of the cost
of traditional batteries
but it's made with non-rare materials
aluminum sulfur and rock solid crystals
so they experimented a bunch and found
that
these
domestically abundant materials
can make a darn good battery now it
might not be efficient enough for
putting in your phone or putting into
your car although they're thinking of
cars later
but it would be efficient enough
it would be efficient enough
for maybe um storing solar power
so if you've got a big grid storage it
might work for that and it might be 1 6
the cost
now
there are some technical issues about
the temperature
it operates on there's some issues about
bauxite
mining to make aluminum
so
as soon as you get into the details of
any of these scientific breakthroughs
you usually run into a wall
it's like oh
i thought this was abundant but it turns
out if you made more of it you'd pollute
too much so
you know so there's there's always a
problem you don't foresee but that's
true of everything right doesn't mean
those are unsolvable
but don't imagine that there are no
problems now
it turns out that they accidentally
solved another the biggest problems in
batteries
one of the biggest problems in batteries
is that they if they operate for a while
they grow these dendrites
there there's something that's like
little growths inside the battery that
um start growing and if they connect it
shorts out the battery and you got
problems
so that's a normal thing that happens to
older batteries
is that they wear out in a specific kind
of way
through these dendrites growing
but this new technology doesn't do that
so they ended up solving the biggest
malfunction problem of batteries
accidentally they weren't trying to
solve that it just happened
so
they're way more efficient
they don't have the risk of catching on
fire
the way lithium batteries do which is a
gigantic problem
don't know how much they degrade that's
a good question don't know how long they
last which is probably going to be the
main question right how long they last
all right
so
if this is true then elon musk has been
right all along
because musk has said
that you could power the whole country
with
relatively speaking not that many solar
panels
but then everybody says
but but but
bauxite is abundant but it's um
there's a lot of pollution when you mine
it
um i'm told this is something i learned
five minutes ago
so
um
if it's true that you could have
abundant materials and create these uh
highly reliable cheap batteries with
non-rare earth materials
and it's 1 6 the cost
everything that elon musk predicted is
true
meaning that solar panels really are the
future
now remember
musk even recently
he's pro-nuclear he tweeted just the
other day that we should
be keeping our nuclear plants alive so
he knows it's a
you know do everything you can situation
it's not just do the best thing
whatever the best thing is so
um
i'm not going to tell you
that solar has no problems because
you've got the waste problems that's a
gigantic problem
but all the pieces look like they're
coming together
when when you predict the future of
solar power
the thing you don't predict
is a new invention
and this might this might be in that
category of something you didn't see
coming a whole
gigantic improvement in battery
technology
rolls-royce somebody is saying in the
comments here rolls-royce is bidding to
sell flat pack to small modular reactors
to japan
and japan is
very pro-nuclear at the moment
yeah i think these small modular nuclear
plants are going to be the way
plus solar plus batteries
well there's a yet more studies saying
that uh mushrooms and psilocybin
can help you with addiction so there's a
new study that came out a big one i
guess
and they found that just two treatments
with psilocybin which is mushrooms
reduced drinking for at least eight
months after the first treatments
so it's the results from the largest
clinical trial trial
of its kind
a hundred percent of all the mushroom
tests
have been at least as far as i know
have been not just positive
but crazy positive
now just think about this we're on the
verge
of solving
energy
because the small nuclear modules plus
these batteries plus solar we're on the
verge of actually just solving energy
fusion's on the way
we're on the verge of solving addiction
because i think the mushroom thing is
going to be way bigger than
than
people imagine
that's huge
that's huge
uh and ai will probably solve a lot of
our other problems
ai by the way ai would uh
probably solve nuclear as well because
one of the problems with the modern
reactors is you have to do a lot of
calculations
to
keep things stable
and ai can do those
better than we can
where are scott's critical thinking
skills
somebody asks
i've noticed that when people question
my critical thinking skills
it's always because they're really bad
at critical thinking
almost never to somebody who has good
critical thinking skills
criticize my critical thinking skills
it almost never happens
but people who are not good at it are
pretty sure i'm not good at it
that's a pattern i noticed
um
so the the fbi or the department of
justice
i just treat them all the same
is saying that in their affidavit said
that there was a
probable cause to believe the evidence
of obstruction would be discovered at
mar-a-lago
probable cause to believe the evidence
of obstruction would be discovered
now
this raises an interesting question what
would be the nature of that evidence
so we're not talking about interviewing
humans
so it's not about a human source
there's there's a physical
evidence of obstruction
what do you think that would be
what would be physical evidence of
obstruction
now one democrat said well it would be
evidence that
he still had documents that he lied and
said he does not have do you think
that's what it is
because if that's what it was i feel
like they would just say that
they would say there's evidence he
obstructed justice
by retaining some things he said that he
gave to us
because it would be really easy to say
what that obstruction would look like
right
because obstruction of justice is this
gigantic category that could mean
anything
but if it's specifically
that he retains some things that he said
he didn't have or he refused to get back
well then the evidence that those things
exist would be evidence but do you need
that
because i thought we had records
of everything that's in those boxes
did the gsa not record what's in the
boxes
because if we have a record of
everything that was in the boxes
and they know what they got
we should know exactly what we got and
what's in the boxes
do you need to go back to mar-a-lago
to look
i don't know
maybe
somebody suggested there was evidence on
video security camp showing somebody
messing with the
secure documents
would that be obstruction of justice
well it kind of depended what they were
doing wasn't it
do you think anybody really unlocked
that door
i'm sure everybody knew there was video
security do you think that anybody
didn't know there was video security
so somebody unlocked that door
and then did something to i don't know
what do what
destroy it or take it out
i mean i can't even imagine
like what the obstruction would look
like give us any kind of hint
did trump send the memo out telling
everybody to obstruct and then he had
the memo ordered to be sealed inside the
boxes
so that they could be found
i mean
to me this is an obvious lie
to me the evidence of obstruction
looks like a fishing expedition that if
you let us go in there we'll find
something
we'll find something that looks like
evidence i
do you think you would sign a
search warrant
for evidence of obstruction if it didn't
tell you a little bit about what that
evidence might look like
like we think we'll find a document with
evidence we think we'll find a laptop
with evidence something
but if you just say you're looking for
evidence of obstruction
what judge signs that
i mean i realize it's easy to get it an
indictment you know you can indict a ham
sandwich blah blah blah
but really
would somebody sign a document with a
generic description of oh it might be
some obstruction of justice might be
some evidence
maybe maybe there's evidence of a murder
we don't know but if we don't look
around you never know
maybe there's a serial killer
we don't know that's why we're looking
if we knew there was a serial killer
we'd act differently but we don't know
so we have to go look
every part of this is fishy as hell
every part of it
yeah why did it take eight hours
actually i'm not too surprised that it
took hours and hours
because
just everything is slower than you think
it should be
i think the part that bothers me about
this this looking for the evidence of
obstruction of justice
is that our government doesn't respect
the public enough to lie to us well
it's one thing to lie to us
it's bad enough
that's really bad
you don't want your government lying to
you
but i feel extra insulted
when the lies are not even designed to
fool
us right
this feels like a different level
a lie that's designed to fool you
you you don't like it
but you kind of understand that's a
world you live in
but when they lie to you in a way that
you can tell just by the way they word
it that is not true
i don't even have to do research to know
this isn't true
do i
do i need to do my own research to know
that
they think there might be evidence of
obstruction as
now i could change my mind by the way it
would be easy for me to change my mind
on this so if we find out tomorrow that
you know there was actually some
evidence of obstruction and it's exactly
what they were looking for
okay i'll change my mind
but the fact that they worded it the way
they worded it
was with such you know
lack of clarity about what it was they
were looking at
that really just
is a blaring confirmation that this is
illegitimate
to me
it looks like they're saying it right to
your face this is illegitimate
we're going to do it anyway
that's what it feels like
it's not legitimate we're not even going
to try too hard to lie to you about it
we're just going to do it anyway because
we want to do it that's why
all right
um
what do you think about this take on
ukraine and russia
that whatever russia gained by control
over those
territories that it it captured from
ukraine
whatever it gained from that
will never be as big as what they lost
in terms of energy control over europe
so putin's
influence over
europe will basically disappear in about
two years
because they will find replacement
sources they won't they won't allow
themselves in this situation again
so wouldn't you say that putin lost
in the sense that his long-term loss of
europe as a
market and also his political control
over europe which is more important
probably
don't you think he lost more in the long
run than he gained with those strategic
places that he
he controls
what do you think
did he gain more or lose more if you're
just comparing the
strategic value of europe as your energy
market
that you're losing
compared to the strategic value of
taking control of that
you know crimea and dunbas area
so a lot of people think he gained more
than he lost
yeah
to me it looks like a loss
so there are more nato countries he has
less money less standing in the world
his technology-based industries are
going to be decimated because they can't
get chips
he's lost his biggest energy
deal
disinvited to a variety of international
things i assume that's going to happen
and all he got for it was more access to
the ocean
that's it
a little bit of land that's good
economically but even the stuff he took
over
it might have been good economically at
one point but if he has to occupy it
with a standing army it's not really
economical anymore
so i don't believe he won on economics
with the with the territory he took over
because it'll be too expensive to hold
it
to me it looks like loss
yeah and if he's doing more business
with china
that gives china
subtle control over russia so that looks
bad too
oh yeah
and russia's army has been shown to be
weak and i think his
the public is going to start noticing
the body bags at some point in russia
now to me i think that my prediction
that ukraine would
win
is one of my best predictions
because if you're the country that god
attacked
winning means surviving
and it looks like ukraine will survive
with less territory but they'll survive
and
if if putin was trying to gain economics
or influence
or
even legacy
i'm not sure that he got that
looks like he might come out behind
but maybe the legacy thing he can
control because he controls the
information
uh wall street journal said if the
winter isn't too cold germany's economy
will only contract by 2.3
well
do you think that people are really at
risk of freezing to death
because i have a feeling that
if the poor actually
couldn't heat
they would just go where they could
right
would the poor actually just stay in
their homes and die
or would they see the people who die
from freezing
are the poor who
um
are sort of in their own situation
it's usually people who nobody knows
they're freezing to death
and then they do
but if you knew that all the poor people
didn't have power
and they wouldn't know that
wouldn't you make sure that everybody
went to all the poor people and said
look you're not gonna have any power
but if you come down to this government
building
you know you can sleep here overnight
until we get power again and we'll have
at least electricity in this government
building
i feel like
it would be a huge disruption
in
normal behavior
but they can keep people warm
right
i don't think people are gonna
i think the ones that will literally die
from the cold
are the ones that don't have any family
or connections like nobody knows they're
there
but i think everybody who asks for help
will just be taken to a warm place
yeah
so we'll see
yeah for months for months yeah
if you had to because you know look at
the pandemic we did a lot of things in
the pandemic that you would imagine were
undoable but you have to do them in an
emergency
we just had a pandemic and the death
rate didn't really matter okay i think
it did matter
uh yeah normal people go where it's warm
that's right
um old people never die from cold right
you know somebody has to teach
democrats that sarcasm is not argument
here's my typical argument with a
democrat
i say
uh
the moon is up in the sky
and the democrat will say
the moon is
really the moon is up at the sky
oh this guy this guy
everybody the dilver guy everybody the
dilbert guy you said the moon it's up in
the sky
[Laughter]
oh stick to comics you 80s
comic guy
looks like half of my discussions
are somebody acting sarcastic
out of context
sarcasm works when you have a point
right if you have a good argument
adding a little sarcasm on top of your
argument
that's good stuff
that's exactly where you want your your
sarcasm to be
make you a good argument
and then just frost it with a little
sarcasm
that's good stuff do you know what is
not good stuff
no argument whatsoever
with a restatement of what you just said
but with a sarcastic tone
oh
oh
trump trump was better for immigration
okay
all right compared to biden
all
so
so trump controlled the border better
than biden is what you're saying all
right guy all right
that's what the cartoonist says
that's what the cartoonist says
that's their whole argument is attitude
have you ever watched
cnn or msnbc to see how they report the
news
they report the news but they make a
face
so they'll report ordinary news
but with a face like there's something
terrible going on
it's like
well president trump says he's gonna cut
taxes
[Music]
and then that's the news
the news is a statement of fact
followed by lots of facial
so that you think there's something
wrong with the fact
but if you only listen to the fact you'd
be like
well that was just like a fact
what's the sarcasm about
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the conclusion of the
exciting content which i prepared for
you
um
if you were a member of the locals
subscription platform
in my community you would be seeing a
micro lesson probably later today on how
to defeat your
social anxiety using reframing
some hypnosis tricks that you could try
on yourself
and
uh so
so i'll be fixing everybody's problems
over on the locals platform
and uh don't you wish you were there all
right
um
all right all right
youtube thanks for joining it was a
great show wasn't it
for now
