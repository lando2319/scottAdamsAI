good morning ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to the highlight of your
life and civilization itself it's called
coffee with scott adams and you don't
even need to be drinking that specific
beverage in order for this to be a peak
experience of your entire life i think
you'll agree and all you need is
a copper mugger glasses tankers cellos
or steiner can't take jungle flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
play pleasure the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called
simultaneous sip and here it is go
oh
yeah
now
i don't know if you've noticed it but i
have cleverly been rewiring your brains
to connect your association with this
show with the association of your
favorite beverage and i think that
you'll find
that it's making the entire experience
sublime
yes it is
well i saw a tweet yesterday by
jack dorsey founder ex
ceo of twitter
and this is like the most interesting
thing anybody tweeted lately
he says the days of usenet irc the web
even email with pgp now if you don't
know
those are earlier technologies you know
when the internet was young
and he said those things were amazing
and then he says
centralizing discovery and identity into
corporations
really damaged the internet
and then he says
i realize i'm partially to blame and
regret it
jack dorsey just apologized for creating
twitter
because of the damage it's doing
that just happened right
now
i may have mentioned that i've you know
i've met jack and interacted enough to
know he's not like other people
[Laughter]
now
i'm not sure how much further i could go
with that but he's just not like other
people
that's all
and
i'm sure he means it you know i don't
think there's any there's anything uh
that isn't perfectly transparent
he he created a product and he's uh
concerned about his social impact
i don't know there's not much you can
say about that
uh
except that
you know maybe it explains why he's not
there anymore i don't know i mean at
least part of it i think that's the
smaller part
um
the cdc is warning that there's this
crisis of young people with
depression
four in ten teens report that they feel
persistently sad or hopeless
and one in five saying that they have
contemplated suicide
that's what the cdc says
as uh mike cernovich
noted in his tweet on this topic
wasn't that caused by the cdc
isn't all this a mental health crisis
that the cdc is warning us about
didn't they create that
not all of it
you know i think technology is
honestly i think technology is 75 of it
and the pandemic's 25
that would be my guess what do you think
would you say similar
is that percentage sounds sound about
right to you
but uh
this is a a way bigger problem than any
of us are willing to acknowledge
and
i would say it's
true
let me let me ask you this
uh how many of you have had a
let's say uh
a brush with somebody who tried suicide
or success succeeded during the pandemic
so let's limit it just to the pandemic
through today
from the pandemic through to today
if any of you had a bad experience with
either an attempted threatened or actual
suicide go
it could be your own right now watch the
comments
yes it's just it is mostly yeses there
are lots of no's but there there's a lot
of yeses
uh i'll say yes i would say yes i would
say that
that this social risk has touched my
life nobody died but
uh only by luck
literally by luck
so
yeah yeah look at that so this is uh
this is like the big problem of our time
and
i'll say again um
imagine this
imagine a candidate running for office
saying that uh you shouldn't be allowed
to use social media until you're 16.
imagine that
i could could a candidate win with that
maybe you know i feel like there are
enough parents who would say you know
what
i'll take that
what are his other policies or her other
policies don't care
don't care
like if you could make that one problem
go away take social media away from
all teens and kids
i'd want that leader
because i don't think anybody has any
idea how damaging this is we have no
idea
um so the russian ruble seems to be
saved
now i'll try to explain this because as
best i can
because you know as as i say too often
i've got a degree in economics i've got
an mba
and
there are some topics that even if you
have some credentials
if you're not pretty deep into that
specific field you get in trouble
so i can't go too deeply into currency
that's not some area that i have a and
the expertise in
but i'll tell you the most basic thing
you need to know
any currency
be it crypto or be it the dollar or be
it the ruble they all have the same
characteristic which is if there's a
demand for it
if you know somebody will accept it well
then it has value
if nobody wants your ruble or your
dollar or your crypto well that has zero
value so the only thing that gives
anything value
is somebody willing to buy it
now what is it that gives the u.s dollar
value
well one of it one of the reasons is
that
oil is traded in dollars
but the other reason is that the united
states government government will accept
the dollar to pay taxes
so you always have somebody who's going
to take a dollar even if it's just our
own government
well it turns out we're not the only
ones to come up with that trick so
russia said hey
if our ruble is plunging in value
compared to these other currencies
why don't we just say our ruble equals x
amount of gold
we'll plug we'll pin it to the price of
gold
and
basically we'll have some kind of
universally agreed standard and it will
just stabilize it and we'll say well
we'll take we'll take that or we'll take
gold
it doesn't matter if we get a ruble it
doesn't matter if we get a dollar
doesn't matter if you own a ship as gold
because now it's all the same and the
way that the russians made the ruble
uh pegged to gold
is that they used their own central bank
to buy rubles
um
and no way to they would use rubles to
sell gold
right so they would accept rubles
to allow people to purchase gold
which gives rubles value because there's
something that you can buy with
it so it
so here's my question
you know i keep hearing people say oh
the dollar the dollar is
going to be dead
and then we'll be in trouble but that
doesn't mean the dollar becomes
worthless does it
i don't i don't think that happens
does it
because wouldn't we just do the same
thing say oh okay
looks like we're in trouble so we'll
just say the dollar
the dollar is now tied to gold
and our and you can pay your taxes in
gold or dollars either one
i feel like we could just do the same
thing and i'm not entirely sure how much
power that
we give away
by just being like everybody else with
our
currency somebody says tie it to bitcoin
that would be the ultimate
all right
so i guess the thing that we can't tell
about any of this russian ruble stuff is
i don't know is it good or bad or is it
heading in the right direction or the
wrong direction
i'm not sure anybody knows
all right
how many of you saw the videos of the
alleged russian atrocities
in ukrainian city where there were
bodies apparently
their hands were bound behind their
backs and they had been killed
and there were a lot of them
and they were just dumped right on the
streets with their hands tied now if
your hands are tied and you're dead it
does look like you're executed that
would be especially if there are lots of
them it looks pretty pretty much like
executed and somebody suggested that it
looks like they were taking the men out
from each of the homes
like knocking on each door and say is
there a man home
and if there was they just took him out
and killed him in the street in front of
his house
i miss what it looks like we don't know
what happened
now
raise your hand how many of you believe
that these reports
are true we saw the video
that doesn't mean it's true
because video can be faked
how many believe do you trust these
stories
oh interesting on locals it's 95 now how
about on
youtube
mostly mostly you don't believe it
now that's very interesting
may i give you a standing ovation
i'm too lazy sitting ovation
this makes me very happy
well here here's the way i would
phrase it
we don't know if it's true
we don't know if it's true
but we do know it's not credible
meaning that you shouldn't believe it's
true
if you believe it's true because you saw
it
with your own eyes on a video then
you're not you're not a clever consumer
of the news
because it's we're still in the fog of
war
we're we are right now in the maximum
propaganda stage
in theory there shouldn't be anything we
hear about the war that's true
nothing
because both sides have a strong
incentive to lie
and we don't have any independent press
in the area
not really so everything you hear is
either going to come from one side or
the other why would anybody tell the
truth
why would anybody tell the truth
seriously
and
you know i did see
uh i hate to say this but i just see
some pictures of what looked to be mass
deaths
and the people looked alive to me
did anybody have that
experience because i feel like i've seen
enough
at least
video and photographs of dead people
even ones that had died recently and
they didn't look
like that
they looked a little bit
alive if you know what i mean
so not all of them i mean some of them
were clearly dead but
i don't know to me
to me this
it looks fake
so i would say it looks fake but i don't
know if it is there's no way to know so
i would say don't make up your mind
whether it's real or not
but be aware that uh
in this situation it would be rare to
see anything that's true
um
shanghai apparently the lockdown in
shanghai because of the
coronavirus
i saw a tweet thread from somebody looks
like a non might be a european or
american or something who's staying in
shanghai and is part of the lockdown
and here's the problem they can't get
food
so they've been locked down for 16 days
and they're running out of food and they
have literally no way to get new food
so they have apps for delivering food
but they're they all go to nothing
because
they're all over overextended
so you can't even go on your app and
order food
so this one individual was cataloging
cataloging his attempt he's using every
every kind of app and every every way he
can
but can't get any
and then finally got some potatoes and
bread but he wasn't sure that they would
be delivered
but at least on the app he ordered them
and
i wonder how bad this is going to get
because i really can't imagine that
china can't feed people if they really
want to
like i don't think they're running out
of food is just a distribution problem
right so i feel like they could solve
that before there are mass deaths but it
looks like it's going to be close
it looks like starvation on mass scale
is at least a possibility at least a
possibility so that's looking pretty
grim
and especially what it does to supply
supply chains around the world
well you know the military was looking
to
find all those right-wing extremists
you know all the the racists and and
white supremacists and stuff
and after they looked into it for a few
years now
they found fewer than 100 instances of
confirmed extremist activity in 2021
and so fox news is presenting this as
they looked and they didn't really find
anything of substance
100
is substance
but
you know we don't know
what exactly the nature of these were
and uh
so fox news is minimizing it a little
bit that's the way they're treating it
as well we looked and there wasn't much
of anything to worry about
and then other people say
wait a minute are you telling me there
are a hundred timothy mcfaze
what
because that would seem like a lot of
timothy mcveigh's wouldn't it
but there's no indication that the 100
or so extremists are timothy mcveigh's
they might just you know like talking
it doesn't mean they're going to blow
something up
so we don't know
but i guess i guess i would be worried
about a hundred
extremists
and of any size group
i don't really care if it's out of 10
million or out of a 100 million
if there are a hundred of them
that's a hundred things i'm worried
about
but
it does look like it wasn't at the very
least it was not a massive military
problem
so that's new
so the one thing i think we can say for
sure
is that
however big this problem is it's not a
massive problem so it certainly
didn't affect readiness or anything like
that
let's see
so zelensky
of ukraine is saying that he won't trade
any territory so ukraine won't allow
russia to take anything
and that the only acceptable outcome is
victory
by ukraine
now
does he mean that
it sounds like a negotiating position
or is it
or is it it's actually a smart
negotiating position do you know why
because if he goes in public and says
absolutely this is the one thing we will
not do
what does that do to the value of that
offer
it increases it
all right if russia thought they could
get land uh cheaply meaning that he
would roll over and give it to him well
then they'd negotiate hard and get
everything they can
but he's now made that expensive
by saying we will not accept it under
any under any circumstance it's not even
on the table
which means
should he have to give it up in the long
and in the end it will appear that he's
giving up something bigger
because the way we talk about the the
land that russia's occupied is it was
practically russian already
[Laughter]
am i right because we say well it was
sort of a separatist ish region with a
lot of russian speaking and
maybe they didn't mostly want to be
russian but a lot of them did and you
know in the
at least in america we
were sort of turning that into a gray
area well i don't know should russia own
it should ukraine i don't know
historical this or that i don't know
but by zielinski saying
no
zero land goes to russia
he just improved his negotiating
position
or
or he means it
now remember i did tell you
that i have not ruled out the
possibility and i think everybody else
in the world has so i'm the only one who
hasn't the zelinski is going for the
kill shot
that he's not trying to survive
he's trying to
take putin out
um scott are you softening your change
of belief that putin wins
you know at this point i don't know what
winning looks like
do you
because
if putin wanted to put enough weight
onto ukraine he could certainly win
but if he puts that much weight on it
then he will certainly be removed from
office also or the odds would be greater
so
i don't know what winning looks like
because i'm not entirely sure he could
win the war and keep his job but it is
possible
let's say if i were to put a bet on it
right now let's see the most likely bet
would be
land for peace
and putin survives
and then in five years we
drop the sanctions because
somebody has an economic interest in
doing it
that's what i think
what do you think
but i have not ruled out i would say
there's 90 chance russia gets at least a
bunch of land and putin survives that's
the 90
10
and i think i'm the only one saying it
ten percent zelinski takes putin out
ten percent
and i think when you see uh both sides
of going after fuel depots down
things are getting pretty serious now
and i wondered why did russia wait so
long to take out a fuel depot
it seems like that should have been
early on
but
i've got a feeling they're all going to
run out of
fuel
so both sides will run into fuel they're
going to be
fighting hand to hand in about a month
so
so
here's some more propaganda
so fox news is writing about whether or
not putin has disagreement within his
you know inner circle and his generals
and are the generals telling him good
information are they lying to him etc
and here's how fox news reports that
watch this first sentence
it's been said more than once in recent
days that russian president putin has
likely been missing has been misinformed
by his security and military services
about the war in ukraine
let's go back to the first part of that
sentence
this is on a news site
it's on fox news site so this is a news
site
and they say it's been said more than
once in recent days
by whom
who said it
and did they have any reasons
what the hell is this way to frame
something you frame it as it's been said
more than once and how many times more
than once twice
is more than once
twice
[Laughter]
and who said it besides me
right the people saying are people like
me we're
like you don't listen to some
like me saying that putin's inner circle
might be having some problems what the
hell do i know and does it matter how
many people like me said it
what if six people like me said it that
doesn't mean anything
it means nothing
yeah okay it's a topic of conversation
but to to imagine that because people
are saying it more than once it has some
weight
that's a little bit of a stretch but
is there any situation in which the
inner circle always agrees
no
so is it reasonable to assume lacking
any direct information
that there's some dissension within the
inner circle it's the most obvious thing
you could ever predict
there probably is no inner circle
anywhere
without disagreement
otherwise you don't need an inner circle
you just need one person
the whole point of an inner circle is
they don't have the same opinion
that's that's really the beauty of the
inner circle they don't have the same
opinions
so i mean you don't really need insiders
to tell you that that's going to be
going on
so an update on the uh author alex
epstein's situation which i reported a
few days ago so earlier in the week alex
had been informed by his publisher that
the washington post was going to do a
hip piece on him
based on something he wrote when he was
18
which if taken out of context and only
if taken out of context would make him
seem like he might be a racist
now for now did i mention he was 18
first of all
can we just leave the 18 year olds alone
i mean seriously
if somebody's an adult
running their career
and that career has taken a certain form
and it looks pretty good
just leave his 18 year old self alone we
have no respect for that none
none we have no respect for digging
through somebody's
almost childhood yeah i get it 18 is
legal but almost childhood
stuff his brain wasn't even developed at
18.
come on i mean let's be a little bit
scientific about it right if the science
says your brain isn't developed until
you're 18
washington post doing a story about what
he said when his brain wasn't fully
developed
then you're going to take him out for
something he said out of context because
because because keep in mind it's not
about what he said
it's about what they say he said
it's not even about what he said
i mean it's the worst possible thing
first of all don't bug
you know don't dig through somebody's 18
year old turds
second of all
don't lie about it
i mean you just compounded the worst
thing you could do and then you lied
about it that's like two of the worst
things and then you and then you're
going to put a hip piece in a newspaper
i mean this is
this is
disgusting behavior
well an interesting thing happened
so alex epstein it turns out as i
mentioned before has lots of uh friends
you know authors often know each other
and he knew a number of people and i was
on his list of people he said hey
you know maybe you want to say something
about this before this hit piece lands
so i did i talked about it and i know he
tweeted some clips of me talking about
it and other people did too you know
with bigger accounts and
people have different reach and
i don't know if this is
true yet but it looks like the
washington post pulled back the story
now if the true if the story had been
true
and they could support it do you think
they would have pulled it back
now maybe it just wasn't done maybe they
needed to talk to a few more people
that's possible we don't really know
but the managing editor
at the washington post wrote
this tweet without without mentioning
what the topic was so there's no mention
of what topic she's talking about
but she tweets this
in the in the course of reporting the
story the washington post's uh maxine
jossello
has been subjected to vitriol and
baseless attacks on social media
she conducts her work with fairness and
to the highest standard and we are proud
to count maxine among our talented staff
of journalists
and i'm waiting for something like
she was working on a story about
she just published a story
about
and the people are complaining about and
the trolls are after her
because
it's not there
why would they leave that out
it isn't the most important part of the
story
why
what about why
it turns out this is the reporter
that uh was allegedly writing a hit
piece on alexa epstein and so
alex's uh preemptive suppressive attack
uh was so effective
that the washington post is
defending itself in public
against the guy that they were trying to
destroy
he managed to capture so much energy on
his team
that they're actually playing defense
and they haven't even published the
story
they're playing defense on a story they
haven't even published
that's how weak
their position was
and that's pretty weak
well uh
uh did you see uh
saturday night live
at a comedian whose name i can't
remember carmichael maybe or something
um
but
there's a story in the news about how
saturday night live
treated the will smith
slap of chris rock
so if you want to know what a slow news
day looks like
a slow news day looks like
news about an entertainer who's talking
about
two other entertainers
in a different place at a different time
is there
anything less
newsy
than the news talking about an
entertainer talking about another
entertainer who did something with
another entertainer
i don't think you could become less
relevant than that
uh of course they had to handle it
because it's a big story but uh
that's where we're at
the news is about people talking about
the news talking about the people
talking about the news
or something like that
there's a little dust-up between john
and andrew sullivan
now jon stewart famously of the
used to be the daily news guy daily news
daily show daily show guy
and he's come back with his
new show streaming i think
and he had andrew sullivan as a guest
and when andrew sullivan arrived it
turns out there was another guest that
he didn't know about and the other guest
was basically there to make andrew
sullivan look bad and then there was a
little disagreement about that and
andrew sullivan's version
is that
the booker
told him he would be the only guest
now jon stewart
who i would consider highly credible
says that didn't happen and that the
booker
told them exactly the story and that
uh andrew sullivan's complaints are are
baseless
now here's what's interesting
john stewart is very credible
don't you think even if you disagree
with him
he's got a pretty long public record of
not lying to you
am i right
if he's not a liar
does anybody think he's a liar i mean
you could disagree with everything he
believes or said
but you probably wouldn't call him a
liar
how about andrew sullivan
same story interestingly
you rarely have a story with two people
of this level of credibility
that's what's weird about the story
usually there's like a known liar
who's uh
saying something about another known
liar or at least one of them is a known
liar and the other one isn't
but when do you ever get a situation
where there's a really specific fact and
question
and both people
are actually very credible
so let me let add my filter to this
so the claim by andrew sullivan is that
he had been uh
told that he would be alone but then
there was another guest to make him look
foolish
this exact thing
has happened to me
now i'm not going to name the show that
this happened
because i think the host of the show
probably didn't know it
because the bookers the bookers work
with the host very closely of course but
i don't know that the host necessarily
hears everything that the booker said to
the guest right so
so i'm gonna i'm not gonna mention the
name of the host but it was a
well-known you know national brand show
i will tell you it wasn't on fox news
because i often say this about fox news
and especially when i if i'm going to
criticize them about how they handle a
story or something i love to add this
fox news is really well produced
really well produced it just impresses
me every time i work with them so say
what you will about their opinions and
the hosts etc well the hosts are all
highly talented which is because they
have good
good management basically
um so it's not not fox news fox news has
great bookers
great bookers i mean just the best in
the business
and uh so wasn't that
but it was another national brand
and uh they did the same thing to me
invited me
with the with the clear indication that
i would be the only guest
now they didn't say it specifically
but that is the default assumption
if somebody says would you like to come
on my show
you assume
that you're no it wasn't bill maher
you assume that you're going to be there
alone
right now the bill maher show is very
clear that you're on a panel or you're
going to be interviewed separately and
there the bill martial did a really good
job of booking so they also are very
professional
okay with some more connish
[Laughter]
if you're just going to sit there and
guess all day
yeah now i like spur cottage because i
think he's a pretty straight shooter
but the booker did not mention that
there would be somebody on the show
to basically make me look like an idiot
and then
use up my time so i wouldn't have time
to defend myself
now
the only thing i'm telling you is that
i'm pretty sure it's fairly routine
for the booker to maybe not mention
somebody else would be there
i right
so if i had to bet who's right
i think john stewart talked to his
booker
and then the booker said oh yeah i told
them i told them the truth
now what's what's jon stewart going to
do
he hired this guy this is his own
employee do you think john stewart is
going to say in public
you know
i asked my booker he said he didn't do
it but i don't trust him i don't trust
my own employee so i'm going to go with
what andrew said
you can't really do that can you
can't really do that
so i think you have a case of jon
stewart backing his employee
which is
i don't think that's the wrong
instinct
i don't think it's the wrong instinct
but it might be the wrong way to go
and uh i'm going to back andrew sullivan
if i had to bet on it i think andrew
sullivan's telling you the straight
scoop
and that he was told by the booker as
one person now there was a there were
other emails that i think may have told
them there were other people there
but it's not reasonable to ask a busy
public person
to look at all the details in an email
it just isn't because we don't
yeah ask how many people have sent me an
email with some details in it that i
didn't read
a lot
a lot
one of the the jerkiest things that that
famous people do and i'm gonna confess
this
is that when people make our life hard
we we push back really hard
because
you can't have too many people doing
that
right
so uh my big pet peeve is somebody
asking me to do something
to which i say yes
and then there's an add-on
this is a typical one with me
um scott would you mind doing a
four-minute interview
for a uh article about you
and i'll be like four minutes for some
publicity
sure
so i'll do the four minute interview and
then at the end they'll say and
would it be too much trouble
if you drew us a cartoon that we could
run just with the article
and this happens to be continuously so
when i say yes i
agree to the thing that i can handle and
then immediately they
bait and switch and offer the thing
that's
sounds reasonable right don't you think
it sounds pretty reasonable
to ask a cartoonist
to just you know whip up a little
cartoon
for your article
it's pretty reasonable
i say no
nope and when they say well we can't you
know the article be no good without it i
say well not my problem i gave you my
four minutes
so when somebody does the bait and
switch
it almost doesn't matter to me what the
switch is
my
just automatic i say okay i'm dealing
with i'm dealing with somebody who can't
be trusted
if you had told me in the first place i
would have said yes or no but if you're
gonna add it on it's just no
automatically it doesn't even matter if
it's reasonable if it hasn't been
disclosed from moment one
nope as a matter of principle
now
do you know how much trouble you get in
when you're that much of an
they don't like it
they don't like it
but so far i always get away with it
lemon minty is saying the thing famous
people think is that we care
well
unfortunately you do
maybe not you specifically but
the truth is that people care about
famous people even even if they
shouldn't
all right
um
so this is the emptiest news day i've
seen in a while everything about ukraine
looks like or the same story
we've already heard
are there some major stories that aren't
being told
i feel like it
all right how many of you know if the
supply chain problem of the
the ships that were stranded off the
off the docks in america
is that worse or better than the last
time you heard about it
isn't that a pretty big deal
that's a pretty big deal right is the
supply chain problem getting worse or
better
come on that's like the biggest thing in
the world
you don't even know the answer to it
there's nothing that will affect you
more
than what is the situation with the
supply chain
if the supply chain is 10 worse than the
last time we heard about it
we're
we're
if it's 10 worse than the last time i
heard about it
because that means there's nothing
that's going to save it
but what if it's 10 better
or 50 better
well that means it wasn't much of a
problem and it's on its way to being
solved
you know unless
china has more coronavirus problems
so i don't read supply chain magazine
yeah but it should be a front page story
remember we saw the coronavirus
stats
you know on a
on every show for months and months
months months
and nobody's going to show us how many
ships are out out to sea in the supply
chain
don't yeah
yeah how about the border
every now and then fox news will talk
about the border
but
are more people coming across the border
or fewer
i don't know
i did hear just before i went live
there's some
mass shooting in california i haven't
seen the uh
i haven't seen the news on them
all right something in sacramento
automatic weapons used
automatic weapons
yeah i heard
i think it was uh jack passovic say that
it sounded like automatic weapons
six dead in downtown
title 42 going away
what's that mean
all right
um
didn't see backup ships at long beach oh
i was just in la and didn't see backed
up ships at long beach
would you see them you would wouldn't
you
all right well if anybody knows the
answer to that i'd love to hear about it
is there any topic that
that we haven't talked about i generally
don't talk about the mass shootings too
much
because i just don't like to give them
attention
uh tennis player drop down we don't know
why okay
that's probably drug test
i don't know why that
you feel that this is
a comment you need to make
um
the ships are parked outside the view
yeah i think that should be
oh god
what is wrong with this guy
all right you were hidden
um the detention of brittany grinder i
don't know about that
so somebody says poor delays in shanghai
are getting worse well that makes sense
um
oh the title 42 was what allowed us to
turn back immigrants because of covet
um
and oh the daily wire making uh kid
shows and selling razors
yeah the daily wire is funny
uh one of their sponsors dropped i guess
it was harry's razors
and so the
daily wire ceo started his own razor
business
that's one way to go yeah and the
commercial was a jeremy boring
the commercial was actually really good
um i there are very few commercials you
watch from beginning to end
because the just the content is good but
that was one of them
yeah it's called jerry's razors is it
oh uh brittany is the us basketball
player being held in russia
yeah you know
i don't know the details of that
i mean i know what the accusation is but
we don't know what's really happening
there i'm not sure that's political
exactly
so the babylon b is still banned from
twitter
you know here's the thing with uh
being banned from twitter
if if twitter gives you an option to
remove your tweet
and it's not like the world's most
important tweet and you don't do it
you know you should was tucker banned
you got banned somebody got banned
so
constantine says scott you were being
dragged as a modern holocaust denier for
your denial of russian atrocities last
week in ukraine
do you really think you were right on
this
well constantine uh let me talk to all
the idiots
if you think that me not believing
stories out of a war zone is the same as
denying
uh denying them
then you don't understand much about how
words work or thinking or
or
the fog of war or anything
so
a question about my opinion about this
is that you know how this works right
people use people drag famous people to
make their own point
so if their own point is that these are
real they'll take somebody who's said oh
i don't believe information coming out
of a war zone and then they'll
then they'll
turn it into something else so me being
dragged only means that somebody decided
to take advantage of
somebody else's fame
to get some attention for their opinion
it usually doesn't mean anything about
me
the person getting dragged is just a
vehicle to boost somebody else's opinion
it's not
it almost never is about the famous
person uh
you're a post band for remember what
yeah
oh here's a photo of all the tankers off
the
la so there's still a lot of them but i
don't know if that's more
is that more tankers or fewer tankers
than the last time we checked which way
is it is it moving better or worse
do you see the ukrainian war zone
marriage proposal now
trump bashed justin trudeau
now have you heard the
the story that
the hunter uh laptop thing might be
nearing some kind of a
legal process
and that that's the way that's the
reason the mainstream media is suddenly
acting like it exists because they have
to get ahead of it
um
gretchen half whitmer
[Laughter]
that's pretty funny
all right
uh biden would have negotiated greenwich
lease if she
was white and straight no i don't know
about that
um
you're off the air what's that mean
scott hasn't talked about the house
legalization of pot yeah i talked about
yesterday
uh my just quickly my take on that is
that the republicans are just
they've been trapped again
they allowed themselves to be trapped
because they have such an irrational
view on marijuana
so the democrats can just make them look
like idiots
by making them vote against it and it
looks like that's what they're doing
how do you feel about a pardon for of
hunter biden
well
the the whole part the whole point of
pardons
is that these are people who generally
deserved what they got right
so the pardons are not based on
how deserving somebody is of punishment
it's the pardons have to be you know no
questions asked or else they don't work
like you couldn't have pardons
if you could also you know question the
person who gave the pardon to the point
of changing the decision
so i guess the question is
do you want to have a system where
pardons are allowed or not
if you decide pardons are allowed
you just kind of have to shut up about
how they're used i mean you could talk
about it
but once you've bought into the concept
that one person can give a pardon
that's the system you bought
and and you know that a whole bunch of
those pardons will not be legitimate but
you know they're going to happen and we
have a system that
prefers to help the innocent
over the guilty
so if we have a system that
gives more pardons than you think makes
sense that's better
than a system that doesn't allow pardons
if you had to choose i take the one
that's
more lenient not less
um all right
yeah the trump rally wasn't really big
news because i don't think he said
anything that was news necessarily
scott is delusional
okay that's a a good logical sentence
there
so there's at least one thought that
i saw on
the internet
that the democrats might want to speed
up the biden prosecution
so that dad biden is still in office to
give the kid a pardon
i don't know
that that's actually not crazy
if if biden uh
the president biden if he knew that his
son were going to be indicted
i think he'd want to stay in office
so how about this what if the only
reason that biden has not stepped down
is that he can't trust his successor to
pardon by
pardon hunter
andy's an accomplice right maybe
but doesn't it look like the reason we
have a brain dead president
is that he has to stay in office to
protect his criminal
son allegedly
allegedly
right
i mean if if i had to
it feels to me that biden would have
already stepped down
i would say that there's no way that joe
biden is not aware that he's now
embarrassing himself
don't you think he's aware of it
he sees his ratings i mean there must be
some people who tell him the truth
he must be able to see himself he's been
around long enough because the the
specific kind of cognitive problem that
biden has
would not prevent him from understanding
the situation
he wouldn't like it but he would he
would still he still has enough
cognitive ability to understand his own
situation i'm sure of that
so i feel as if he's dragging it down at
the at the cost of the country
to protect his family
worst possible thing
and so i offer you the paul the
following really really annoying opinion
i think biden should should pardon him
right now
you can do that right you can pre-pardon
somebody give me a legal opinion
you can pre-pardon
as much as you hate to hear this
i think you should pre-pardon us
because as much as you say oh it'd feel
really good to
take him down and we'd really find out
what's in the laptop and all that and
that's all true and i agree with you i
would like to know what he did and i
would like him to pay if there's
yeah if there's something to pay for
but what's good for you
like what's my personal self-interest
my personal self-interest
is that we have a president who's not
brain dead
and if part of the deal is he gets to
pardon the hunter maybe himself somehow
i don't know
but that he leaves the office so we have
at least a competent democrat
i mean i would take a competent democrat
over biden right now i mean it's not
really kamala
so i don't know what that would do
but
uh
i would take that deal i would let
hunter get a pardon a pre-pardon without
even knowing if he had a crime
and
and and biden too just just to move on
because i think the stakes are so high
that the individual crimes they may or
may not have committed
uh they're just below my level of caring
as bad as they are i'm not minimizing
them i'm saying they're pretty darn bad
if
if anything like the allegations are
true
that's pretty bad
but not nearly as bad as having an
incapable president
so it's a tough choice
i i would take i would i would accept
the pardon under those
if it meant that biden left office
sooner
even for a democrat
right even to be replaced with someone
who has similar thoughts but just more
capability i'd be okay with that i would
take that trade
and i know most of you wouldn't but i
would
yeah and there's no perfect answer
because you're gonna be unhappy in both
ways
yeah he can only pardon the federal
crimes but i imagine these are mostly
potentially federal crimes if there's
any crime at all
yet let's be clear that i'm not aware of
any crime that hunter committed are you
and we have speculation but
you know the the the process has not
done what the process needs to do if if
indeed the process will do anything
tax invasion
well even the tax evasion apparently he
paid his tax bill
and my understanding is that if you pay
your tax bill in full
even if you evaded it
if they haven't yet prosecuted you
they look at that and say ah all we
really wanted was the money that's good
enough
i know
so i think that's a slap in the wrist
um
all right gun crimes yeah
for some reason there will be no charges
about the gun crimes i'm sure
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you later on youtube
