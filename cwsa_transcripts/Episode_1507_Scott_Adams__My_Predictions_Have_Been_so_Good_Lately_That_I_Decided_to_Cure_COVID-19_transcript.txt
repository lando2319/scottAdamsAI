good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of your day it's called
coffee with scott adams
because it features coffee and
yeah it's got items
so i don't know how this could be better
oh well okay
there is one way this could be better
two coffees and scott adams but don't
overdo it don't overdo it you don't want
too much happiness
all at once yeah i forgot to put on my
youtube microphone
how many steps are there to make this
work
that was 17 how many do i do correctly
14 or 15 every single
day well
now if all things are working out
youtube is going to be able to join on
the simultaneous sip because we made a
little change i think it's implemented
today
in which you will be able to see the
beginning and not have to wait for the
pre-commercial on youtube so if that's
the case let's test it out
because all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker jealous diet a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes everything better that's right i
turned off the pre-commercial
for you
it's called the simultaneous sip but it
happens now go
well i don't know how much of my total
revenue
just got turned off by turning off that
pre-commercial but
it was worth it
uh
because a lot of you were saying uh we
don't like to wait for the simultaneous
sip and i hear you i feel you
well rasmussen did a poll and asked if
they thought
biden or trump is doing a better job on
the border what do you think what do you
think
well actually they asked if biden was
doing a good job at the border and not
so much
so it looks like even democrats have
turned against biden on the immigration
stuff surprised
nope
don't be surprised
san francisco has decided to build what
they call tiny cabins for the homeless
tiny cabins
little uh
cabins basically they're portable you
can just set them up i think they're
going to start with 44 of them
to replace their intensity
so going from intensity to tiny cabins
now here's the important part of this
i think this is the future and you're
seeing a lot of it now i don't know if
it's just the tiny part but the
the homes that are modular and built in
the factory and then assembled
that's that's the way it's going the
tiny ones will just be first but i think
that's the way everything's gonna go
well may i brag about one of my
predictions yeah as if you could stop me
try it try stopping me you can't
well i go back to this every now and
then just to show you how prescient i am
uh the havana syndrome you remember when
the story said there's probably some
kind of a sonic weapon pointed at the
embassy in cuba because people are
having a bunch of health problems
and then it seemed to be spreading
around the world
canada was next somewhere else was next
and it looked like oh my god somebody's
got a sonic weapon and they keep
attacking our embassies
well a group of 20 cuban scientists got
together to study all forms of this
situation and decided
that the only the only explanation of it
was mass hysteria that's right the only
explanation
that fit all of the facts was mass
hysteria
now
this is 20
cuban scientists and one could assume
okay cuba doesn't want to be
you know
stained with this idea that they let a
less incredible weapon attack an embassy
so you can't totally trust the 20 cuban
scientists they may be
influenced by the state
but
they did say
they made a claim that other people can
look at which is that the evidence
doesn't support any other hypothesis
that's it there's only one hypothesis
that you could even have
and they made references to
violating
rules of physics and blah blah blah
so the thing that people don't know is
that master stereo is very common
if you know that it's common
and then you see a situation like this
and you say okay what's more likely
is it more likely that a very common
thing happened
or something that we've never seen
before a sonic weapon
which is more likely the common thing or
the badass crazy thing
it was kind of obvious now i'm not
saying that the cube and scientists are
the the final answer
but this is the final answer
if there's anything i've been confident
about
in a
contrarian prediction
this is my most confident contrarian
prediction you will never find a sonic
weapon
right
the lithuanian government
is urging its population to throw away
their chinese phones
for security issues
so lithuania is saying take your chinese
huawei phone and toss it in the garbage
because there's too many security flaws
and i say we should let lithuania be a
model for the rest of us
that's right lithuania model for the
rest of us
um
in the book apparel you know woodward's
book
so you know the woodward is the least
credible journalist in the world at the
moment
his book actually as you know it treated
the fine people hoax as if it were real
that's all you need to know about the
rest of the book
the most obvious hoax in american
history
the most debunked oaks he just treats it
like it's real
so it makes you wonder if watergate was
even real
but the latest ridiculousness
is a report in the book that says trump
didn't want a golf course in africa
because he feared lions would eat him
true or false
it's in the book
it's in the book so
what do you think
that trump didn't want to build a golf
course in africa because he feared lions
would eat him
no
no
he was not afraid lions would eat him
now did he say that
probably
yeah did he make did he make a comment
out loud with actual words
the lions might eat you if you had a
golf course
in africa probably
he probably said that out loud that
sounds almost exactly like something he
might say
do you think he was serious
the the the entire project he just he
just brushed away the entire project
because
here's another possibility
can you think of one other reason not to
build a golf course
any other reason what would be one other
reason to not build a golf course just
one
i'll give you one reason to not build a
golf course
no golf course is profitable
do you need another reason
all right golf courses aren't profitable
are they i think that you build a golf
course more for your brand and does you
want to play golf and you're rich enough
to do it and
et cetera
but i'm pretty sure that golf golf is
not a good business
it's just it goes good with trump's
portfolio and i think he likes the gulf
but are you telling me that trump is
making money on his golf courses
i doubt it i would imagine those are
lost leaders i don't know i mean i'm
speculating here but the number one
reason to not build a golf course is
that they're bad businesses
don't you think trump knew
that building a golf course in africa
wasn't exactly going to be a money maker
did he have to explain it
did he have to go through the numbers
if you can't make money on a golf course
anywhere else
are you going to make money on a golf
course in africa
and don't you think that trump's golf
courses have a lot to do with where he
personally wants to golf
i mean really what's the point of owning
a business with your name on it
if you
if you have to do projects in places you
don't want to visit
does he want a really good does do you
think trump wanted to go to africa to
play golf
probably not
do you think he ever wanted to go to
scotland
to play golf because he does have a golf
course there probably
probably it's you know
where his ancestors were some of them
so this is the most ridiculous fake news
uh here's some more fake news from the
new york times today they tweeted
breaking news the trump campaign knew
this is the key word they knew
they didn't speculate
they didn't doubt
they didn't ask questions about
but this is what the the
the new york times is reporting as a
fact
their reporting is a fact
what the trump campaign
knew
what was in their heads
how did they get that scoop
about what was in people's secret
thoughts
that's a pretty hard scoop to get isn't
it
or maybe it didn't happen
maybe let me read the rest of it so you
can see the context
it says the trump campaign knew
days after the 2020 election that wild
claims of voting machine tampering
pushed by sydney powell and others
allied with trump were not true
court filings show
really
are you telling me that there was
somebody in the world not just the trump
campaign but anyone in the world
who knew
that the claims were untrue that knew it
now
i said they were untrue the moment they
came out
right
fact check me on this as soon as i heard
there's some venezuelan hugo chavez
connection i said okay i don't know
about the election in general
but i'm telling you that's not going to
pan out
so that was the first thing i said when
i heard it right i said the venezuela
part won't be true
even if even if all this stuff is
don't know about that but even if
something else is true that part's not
gonna be true
now
when i said that
did i know it
did i know it
no
it can't be known
just like the
just like the cuban you know the havana
sonic weapon
i'm pretty confident that that's not
real
but do i know it
how could i know it
it's not knowable
right unless it was violating some
rule of physics
well actually the cuban scientists said
that but i think that part i would
discount
just because somebody doesn't know how
to do something doesn't mean it violated
the laws of physics so that part i have
a discount
um
oh yeah where is the audience low
audience today
interesting
don't know why
so yeah when the new york times says
they know that somebody else that is not
them knew something
that's fake news
because people don't know
that a story is wrong they just suspect
it or they doubt it or they're skeptical
or they would need more information to
be convinced but nobody knew it come on
as soon as you put
you know certainty into some stranger's
head and they haven't expressed that
certainty it's just ridiculous
all right
um here's another one of my predictions
that's looking better over time i
predicted that the longer trump was out
of office the better he would look
the longer he was out of office the
better he would look and that makes
sense
because you would forget like his mean
tweets and the the daily
cycle of abuse from the news
but you'd probably remember that you
know north korea doesn't look like a
threat you'd probably remember
he pushed hard on china trade and now we
think that's a good idea et cetera
so the the thinking was that his ideas
the things he pushed and wanted to do
immigration
another perfect example
would look better compared to the
alternatives over time
sure enough there's a uh
monday harvard caps harris poll
released by the hill
um and 48 of people responded said they
had a positive view of trump which is
more
than the positive view of biden right
now
so the current popularity of trump is 48
and binds at 46
according to this bowl
now that's close enough to call it a tie
but it's a tie
right
and i think it's just going to be more
of this every day that goes by
trump's going to look better compared to
the
nightmare of the biden administration
so afghanistan we're going to remember
was was botched
um
basically
everywhere there's a one-to-one match-up
i think trump wins right somebody give
me an exam counter example
somebody give me a counter example i'm
gonna here's here's my claim
that for every topic where you can say
one to one compare what trump did to
biden and i'm not talking about mean
tweets or or rhetoric but just policy
one to one what would be an example
where biden um has done a better job
a one-to-one match up what policy would
that be
coveted rapid tests oh
well
yeah i'll give you that but all biden
did on covet rapid tests is
funding
i feel like trump would have done that
too
um
but both of them failed completely in
pushing the topic
through the fda so i would say that both
trump and biden were 100 failures on
rapid testing
but trump but biden did get funding we
don't know that trump wouldn't have
um
promoting vaccines now i think they're
about even on that
um
pushing covet and test hoax is not
productive well nobody did that
um at least trump didn't do that
all right just looking at some of your
comments to see how i'm doing here to
this morning
um has better dementia yeah
all right
here's how the democrats lose everything
and it's starting to look like they're
just going to get wiped out in the
midterms
it's a little too early to predict but
at the moment it looks like democrats
are just going to get slaughtered in the
midterms now part of that's an easy
prediction because it tends to go that
way uh after after a president of one
party is elected you know the midterms
often go against them so that part
wouldn't be surprising but um in
virginia's new down luden or lieu down
county
the board of supervisors voted to look
into just look into study it
reparations
reparations
now if you were the republicans
and you wanted to really win everything
what story would you want to be in the
news
reparations
right now i've actually just give you
context i think reparations should be
looked at
different from implementing them but
looking at them sure
well you know if it's a if it's a big
question in people's minds
if there are lots of citizens who care
about it
let's uh let's let's work through it
let's take a look
if you're afraid of information or
you're afraid of debating
i can't defend that
now if you say to yourself well i know
how it's going to end scott it's going
to end with there's no practical way to
do anything i mean you could want to do
things but there's no practical way to
get it done maybe
maybe but that's assuming the end before
you start right
if people care about something and want
to look into it
i don't know how i object to that
how do you object to looking into stuff
right that would be unreasonable
now my own um
my own path
that i would recommend you've heard this
before might be new to something for you
on youtube
is
is
there is a way to do it
there is a way to do reparations that
would make everybody happy
you just increase school choice and you
get you you do whatever you need to do
to sort the teachers uh unions because
the teachers unions are the the main
source of continued systemic racism
the the teachers unions block
competition in schools
which guarantees that bad schools stay
bad because there's no competition no
you know they don't have to be good
and but as soon as you got uh
you know as soon as you got competition
eventually things would even out so if
you said to me scott let's call it
reparations but we're just going to make
school choice better it won't be
directed specifically at the black
population of the united states it'll
help everybody
but it will help the black population a
lot more just because the way the
demographics you know roll out
to which i say
i can live with that
you solve a problem for everyone
everyone who is at the same economic you
know disadvantage
if it disproportionately helps the black
poor population i say that's reparations
don't you
what would be the argument against it i
mean the whole point of reparations is
that one community got an unfair deal
for however long
so if we make an unfair deal in terms of
what percentage of the population is
influenced by it
i feel like that would be a little bit
of reparations and it would be the very
best kind of reparations
because how would you like to know that
the biggest problem in the united states
which is the teachers unions it's the
biggest problem in the united states how
would you like to know
that the black population of the united
states solved it
that'd be a pretty good
pretty good thing to have on your
permanent record wouldn't it
to solve it for everybody you know not
just solve it for yourself solve it for
everybody
that would be an amazing accomplishment
for the black
population of this country and very i
would say
it would be one thing that might bring
us together a little bit
we could agree on that
so
that's where i am on that um how many of
you saw my ufo video from last night did
anybody see it
uh
i was taking a video of the moon because
the moon looked interesting in my
backyard
and there appeared on my video a small
tick tock
shaped object
that as i was filming its motion
couldn't it seemed to defy
it seemed to defy physics
because it'd be going in one direction
and then just like instantly change
directions
i don't know that there's anything in
american technology that can do that
or or earth technology
i don't think human technology
can do that
now you're probably asking yourself
scott you know what it was it was like a
bug or something right nope nope
um i can tell you
and i'm not lying it was not an insect
it was not
that was ruled out for sure i could tell
you how but
um
was it a laser no wasn't laser
what was it
what was it
lens flare yeah it was i think that's
the right term so i think it was some
kind of a uh
reflection he sort of thing that might
be the wrong word but it was it's an
artifact
from the lens
and the fact i'm looking at a you know a
bright object i guess i think that's
what it was
but when you watch the the video you um
i don't know if you could tell that i
was manipulating the tic deck
if you watched the video could you tell
that the way i moved the camera
was moving the tick tock the tic-tac
right it looked like it was moving on
its own but i was just moving the camera
so when i tracked it with the camera and
moved to the right it looked like it was
moving
and then when i moved the camera to the
left it looked like it was moving left
it was just a camera artifact do you
know what's interesting about it
my camera artifact looked a lot like a
one you've seen huh
haven't you seen that ufo video
looked a lot like it didn't it
i don't know if it's the same problem a
lens artifact
but i think it is
i think it's exactly why
your ufos look like tic tacs
because it's that lens artifact
now by the way i didn't do that
intentionally i actually was just trying
to take a picture of the the moon
why no no good reason
i just took my video camera out and i
saw that artifact i'm like oh i'm going
with this i'm going with this
all right
in a publication called the aj plus
apparently biden is using title 42 which
trump administration used to
to expel
illegal
migrants
and he's expelled way more than trump
has so
trump expelled 440 000 people under that
title 42 whereas biden has already got
rid of 690 000
now
what about this story is misleading
well everything right because there was
this you know giant
giant surge under biden which biden of
course is responsible for the surge
but
i don't know that you can compare it's
not like an apple in an orange so
uh biden created his own problem and
then he semi solved some of it by using
title 42 but it's just not it's not
exactly apples and oranges here because
biden opened the border
but it does tell you
that uh biden's no saint
biden is no saint when it comes to
immigration how is this going to affect
him on the election
i feel as if he has he's lost in every
way he could lose he's deported more
people than trump
so that looks bad
at the same time he's opened the border
that's everything bad
right
it's one thing to open the border and
that's going to make some percentage of
the population pretty angry
and it's another thing to
deport lots of people
he's doing both he's doing both of the
wrong things at the same time
i did predict that biden would end up
doing trumpian things yeah that in the
long run he's going to have to end up
doing
some number of things that trump did
whether he likes it or not
well cnn is reporting new and shocking
disclosures about last year's uh you
know around january 6 and
at the time when trump was doubting the
election uh outcome
and let me tell you the shocking
shocking new stuff
right this is both shocking and new so
watch how shocked you are and how new
this sounds because it's shocking and
new
it's not just shocking
it's not just new
so watch for how the shocking this is
and new all right
so it says that trump had a blueprints
for how to prevent congress from
certifying the election
it was sort of written up in a memo
and by a lawyer about how mike pence
could uh you know thwart the process by
not accepting some states
etc
which part of that is new
none of it right
we all knew that
we all knew that trump was trying to get
pence to overthrow the
result
okay so this part's not new
and it's not extra shocking because we
heard this now why would it be shocking
if
trump thought it might work
because i think that
you know whether whether it is
constitutional or not
looks like he had an argument he thought
he maybe had a case
why couldn't he do that if he thought it
might be illegal
he can do anything that's legal
and if he had a lawyer explain it to him
would trump assume that the lawyer would
keep him from doing something illegal
remember it was just a draft but it came
from a lawyer a high-end white house
lawyer
wrote up a draft that says you know
maybe we can maybe this will work
if the president does something that a
lawyer says looks legal
is it shocking
well it's not exactly shocking
it might be wrong
but it's not exactly shocking if
somebody if a lawyer tells you something
is legal and then you act like it's
legal
how do you decide what's legal
let me tell you how i do it i ask a
lawyer
i don't just sit there and say oh sounds
good to me i'd ask a lawyer if the
lawyer tells me it's legal i'll act like
it's legal
that's all trump did not too shocking
all right
um
here they say trump's own campaign uh
staff knew the outlandish claims of
fraud
made by the president's lawyers were
utterly false no they didn't
no they didn't they didn't know it
they probably suspected it
right they were probably very skeptical
probably doubted it
but they didn't know it
because it couldn't be known
um
here's another shocking thing trump sent
a letter full of false information says
cnns cnn 2 georgia's secretary of state
brad rapson berger asking him to
you know try to decertify the result
which part of that didn't you know
did you not know
that trump wanted georgia to decertify
the results
which part of that is new or shocking
i think we all knew that right
uh the fact that there might have been a
letter doesn't really change anything
and the this is cnn's reporting just the
way they were this is just hilarious so
the book peril woodward's book
also contains a passage that shows trump
cared little for truth
what voters decided in november or
bedrock constitutional values
but agonized about his reputation and
muse the accepting defeat would brand
him as one of history's losers
is that true
can woodward know that trump cared
little for truth
or what voters decided
how do you conclude that
was it a brain scan
we could we could know for sure what
trump did and what he said
but you can't know what he thought
yeah you can't know what he thought
that's not a thing
so that's cnn with their new and
shocking disclosures of things we've
known for many many months and are not
that shocking at all
um
so i guess uh biden and boris johnson
had got together and boris johnson
answered some questions three of them
but biden's staff shouted down the
reporters when they tried to ask a
question
this is so embarrassing
do you remember when
trump was the one that you thought was
going to embarrass us in public
here we've got the prime minister of the
uk
sitting right next to biden
watching his staff
not let biden answer questions right
after right after boris johnson did take
questions
right boris johnson took questions in a
foreign country
biden wouldn't take questions in the
white house
he just looks incompetent
right what
what uh interpretation would you put on
it when you watch boris johnson answer
three questions and then you watch
biden's staff tell him he can't
essentially by shouting him down
yeah it looks weak it looks incompetent
and and it looks like we don't have
confidence in our own leader
it's really a terrible look
now
who thinks at this point
that trump's reputation actually was
worse than biden's right now does
anybody think that
because you know no matter what your
political leading is
you could still have an opinion about
what other people thought of trump even
if you liked them
you could have an opinion that foreign
leaders maybe didn't
i mean that would be reasonable if you
thought that
but do you think that foreign leaders
really
had a lower opinion of trump overall
than biden
i don't know what do you think
maybe i mean we don't know for sure but
i would say that the hypothesis that
trump was the embarrassing one
feels debunked doesn't it
not in the sense that you know for sure
that his reputation was better with
these other people but that there's no
evidence it was worse
let's put it that way when you say that
no court has found
a love to go to the no court has found
no court is found
that other countries think trump was
less respectable
than biden or at least you know less
capable
yeah
all right um
now my predictions have been so good
lately
that i thought
damn scott if you're so good at
predicting why don't you solve
the pandemic
and that's a reasonable a reasonable
ask
given my incredible
high quality predictions
why don't i apply that to the pandemic
and just predict how we can get out of
this thing and maybe speed it up
are you ready
okay
here it comes i asked this question
would a fan
that moves the air in a
room reduce the risk in the room
of the coronavirus
just a regular fan
now
every one of you people just
thought yeah
having good
circulation
with the outdoors is a good idea scott
no i'm not talking about
circulation
inside to out
that's not the topic
right so everybody who thinks i'm going
to talk about circulation
you just leave now
i don't want to see your comments
no circulation talk
we all know an open window is a good
idea
right
if you think you need to tell me
that being outdoors is better than being
indoors or that opening a window is good
don't participate
we're not talking about that
okay
so i asked this question
with the air movement itself at least at
the level that a fan could accomplish
would the air move in itself make the
virus
degrade
and here are three good hypotheses that
i saw you ready
hypothesis number one
uh a fan would make your virus particles
bounce against surfaces
more aggressively
true or false
that faster wind circulation
would cause more of the viruses
to come into contact with a surface
because the surface might be a wall
or a ceiling
why would somebody say false
add something to that
it seems to me that if you add energy to
the system
more of everything happens
right
that's going to be my take if you add
energy to the system in the form of wind
everything that can happen will more
more happen
because there's more movement so if the
if something can hit a wall there'll be
more of it
so
there are two ways that a virus could be
degraded by hitting a wall
number one the physical contact with the
wall
you know might
affect its water particle and you know
take off its little cover
yeah the the surface itself we know
kills it
because we're not worried so much
anymore about touching stuff right you
don't see people wearing gloves so much
in the grocery store
we're not really worried about surfaces
because apparently surfaces kill the
virus pretty quickly pretty much any
kind of surface
right so the number one the fan blows
them against surfaces more often and
therefore the surfaces kill it
number two
fans reduce humidity
i'll agree with this the fans reduce
humidity
moving air reduces humidity now fact
check me on all the assumptions but i
believe that's true
i looked it up
uh lower humidity
is damaging for coronavirus that's in
the air do we agree
i'm saying all knows but
i googled it so
i'm pretty sure i'm right even though
you're disagreeing
so later you can google it yourself and
see what you think
but the thought is that the moving air
would reduce the uh
you know the uh
the volume of water that contains it
and therefore the virus would fall free
because it would have less water
supporting it in the air i guess
um
all right so i see i can i see your
disagreement on this but
um if if it's not true that air flow
reduces
humidity
uh i would be surprised
scott is the biden of science
i accept that
here's the
third way and my help
by distributing it
um could it
turn the virus from a deadly infection
into a vaccination by making it so
little everywhere
because when people are breathing their
their virus is in a plume
that takes a while to distribute if you
walk right into somebody's plume
plume i say yeah plume
if you walk right into somebody's plume
aren't you getting a big viral dose and
therefore even if you
if you do get sick it'll be worse
but also increases the chance you'll get
sick
if the wind is going the plumes
dissipate faster
and you have no plume
now the room will still be full of virus
but it won't be concentrated how is that
not better
now if you wait hours and hours the room
just you know if there's no circulation
the room will just fill with virus and
then it doesn't matter if you're in a
plume or not the whole room will be a
plume
but
every room has some kind of circulation
right there's
you're not like in a sealed vacuum or
anything so i would say that a fan would
reduce
uh your odds of infection in three ways
the particles getting banged against
surfaces which kills them reduced
humidity which is bad for viruses
and
it's distributed so there's no plume to
get you a high viral load
this is my solution to the pandemic now
how could you
test it
i feel like you could do a survey
of people who got the virus and knew
where they got it
because there are enough of those cases
where we do you have a really strong
idea where you got it because other
people got it in the same place etc
could you not
test the airflow in those places
could you not find that where there are
ceiling fans you don't get infected
i'll bet that's true
i'll bet you could find
that wherever there's air flow from
ceiling fans
that you have almost no infections
so there's my hypothesis
remember
all my predictions have been right so
far
why would this one be wrong could it be
could it be
that you just need to turn on your fans
you just need to turn on your fans
now
or and it could be that there's just
some a minimum amount of airflow
that
is required for the virus to spread
effectively
all right
when i asked that question whether the
fans would degrade the virus the worst
answer i got was from peter elfthen who
said
no
because imaginary things can't be
damaged
so peter believes that the virus
doesn't even exist
strong take
all right um
so here's a uh
surprising report
uh i don't know if this is true so i saw
this on yahoo news i think
so
rustic inc writes in all capital letters
scott stop embarrassing yourself
rustic
there are two things you don't want to
do in public
number one
don't mock somebody by calling yourself
a genius
and spell the word genius wrong
right
never box somebody for not being a
genius or call yourself a genius and
spell the word genius wrong i've seen
this done many times don't do that
the other thing you don't want to do
is say in all capital letters stop
embarrassing yourself
because you said it in all capital
letters and embarrassed yourself
now
if you said in a lower case i might ask
you in what way am i embarrassing myself
but if you do it in all
uppercase you just spelled genius
without a u if you know what i mean
all right
um
wuhan and you are scientists
according to this
report that i don't know if it's true or
not
they were planning to release or at
least they thought about it i enhanced
enhanced airborne coronavirus particles
into chinese bat caves
to inoculate them against
diseases that would be could jump to
humans
so
they wanted to actually put
a disease into the back the bat caves
now
i think
right off the bat
right off the bat
right off the bat
you can see that this was a bad idea
right off the bat
um
why is it do i have to tell you why this
is a bad idea
why is it a bad idea to release a deadly
virus into a bat cave
it would kill robin
i mean that's the obvious problem
robin dead
now batman might might pull through but
robin i think robin would not make it
robin looks a little weak
so you don't want to put any deadly
pathogens into the bat cave because uh
batman's in there and robin and
uh could be a problem
but
um
isn't this exactly the idea that i
that i came up with the other day which
is can't you find the weakest variant
of covid and just make lots of it and
give it to me
can somebody please infect me with the
weakest variant of covid
i mean just rub it all over my body
because if i get the weak one i'm gonna
be fine right i just don't want one of
the strong ones but if i get the weak
one
aren't i gonna be
pretty protected against a strong one
just like these bats would be
same concept
same concept
if this was going to work for bats why
wouldn't it work for people
so
they also according to this report which
i have some skepticism about
that they also plan to create chimeric
viruses
now you might think that a chimeric
virus
is actually a
chimeric virus
c-h-i-m-e-r-i-c but don't call it
generic don't call it that call it
chimeric
i don't even know if that's the right
pronunciation but one of them is right
don't do the wrong one
anyway um
they're trying to create these viruses
that would be genetically
enhanced
to infect humans more
what
they also plan to create chimeric
viruses genetically enhanced to infect
humans
more easily
and requested 14 million dollars from a
defense advanced research projects
agency darpa
to fund the work
what
what
they actually asked for money to
make genetically deadly viruses that are
specifically engineered to kill humans
probably a bad idea i don't know i know
i'm no virologist
i'm no expert
i'm no expert on these things but it
feels like a bad idea right
feels bad
now when i heard that um
fauci had been involved you know the
allegation is he was involved in some
kind of funding
on gain of function
was i worried about that
not that much
because it does seem like the argument
that you need to be experienced and gain
a function because you know it's a it's
a risk that's coming at you
i think there's something to that
that studying just the idea of
weaponizing a virus or how it could be
done or you know what the what the risk
is
that might be worth doing
but
there was somebody actually planning to
make the world's most deadliest virus
for humans
like they were actually trying to make
that
and somebody had that as a plan
i'm not sure i believe this do you
i mean i suppose anything's possible but
i'm going to say i'm not going to say
it's false
that would be going too far i'm going to
say i'm skeptical about this one
this this one has
a little bit too much in the nose
right a little too on the nose
that they were actually trying to make
the virus that's this virus
that feels
wow
am i wrong am i wrong that it's too on
the nose
you know once you've heard me say it
right until somebody says it you don't
realize something's on the nose somebody
has to say it the first time and then
you say hmm
it does look a little on the nose
yeah i mean
i'm going to say that this one is uh
there's a solid chance that is true
there's a good solid chance it's true
but i'm skeptical i think we might find
out there's a little nuance to the story
that we don't know yet
um
and
when
the story goes on it says when covert 19
was first genetically sequenced
scientists were puzzled about how the
virus had involved such a human specific
adaptation
but apparently that adaptation is
exactly what they wanted to do
looks like they did it
um
but it also answers this question
doesn't it do you remember
do you remember my question
um
my question was
why is there exactly one bad variant
the delta
we got
are there hundreds or thousands of
variants now
and only one bad one
i feel as if the bad one was engineered
just like the first one
i feel if they're just i feel as if
they're just two engineered viruses that
will find that out some day and that all
the other variants were weaker
lambda and mu well let's see i mean so
far
so far now right
so far now
um
anyway
that
is your news for the day
and um wish uh wish my cat well today my
cat's going under the knife today a
little surgery
um
and she's got uh
ear polyps
she's doing not well so boo has not been
able to eat for days and we're giving
her fluids and antibiotics and stuff but
her
head's all infected
she's not doing well so she's going to
have some surgery today 11 o'clock
california time
and
i wish her luck
because she's my best friend
all right um
yeah watch your pockets it's going to be
expensive
i think this is going to be the
fifteen thousand dollar cat when we're
done
but worth every penny and i will talk to
you
tomorrow youtubers
