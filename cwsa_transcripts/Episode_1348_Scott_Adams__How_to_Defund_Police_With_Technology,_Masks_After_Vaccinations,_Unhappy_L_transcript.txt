it's called the simultaneous sip and i
hope
you are ready now
well if that wasn't enough excitement
for you
you can see that there's going to be a
whiteboard presentation
later yes yes it's that good
let's talk about all the things uh
in my ongoing segment of joe biden
evolving into
donald trump we now have biden playing
golf
while there's a crisis on the border
so remember every time you see biden
just evolving into a version of trump
just remember who told you it was going
to happen months before it did
now since we know from the
project veritas undercover video
we know the cnn at least according to
their technical director who was caught
on camera
we know that they actively try to make
joe i didn't look like he's you know
vital and young
and fit and that they said it out loud
you know
directly said we're trying to make him
look like he's a healthy guy
and i have to compliment whoever
dressed him from the photo shoot because
you don't see him golfing
i don't know if there any photo i don't
know if there's any video
is there any video of him actually
golfing
because i sort of like to see his swing
if you know what i mean
but my compliments to the wardrobe
propagandist he looks really good
there's a photograph of him in a really
flattering
golf outfit that looks new and shiny and
you know if i'm going to be objective
there is there is a thing that joe biden
does very well
which is he's a pretty good role model
for fitness
right i believe he's been a a
exerciser keeps his weight under control
even at his age you got to admit
that's that's not nothing all right i
wish we had more president who would uh
have sort of a fitness bias
but it's funny because we know that this
is you know sort of a staged
propaganda kind of thing but it still
works i don't mind when our leaders
i don't mind at all when a president
does a staged thing
to look you know strong and uh athletic
that's fine that's a good technique
actually
what about this argument you know the
argument against
letting kids use let's say private
schools
is that if you move the funding from the
public schools the public funding
to let it follow the students and they
go to private schools
there'll be less funding for what's left
behind
so the public schools will fall apart so
goes the argument
if you let money flow to the private
ones
i would like to challenge that that
theory and here's the assumption where i
think we differ
uh obviously math is math if
if money moves away from the public
schools they'll have less money
that does seem like a problem right so
so far that's not crazy
but there's a difference in assumption
my assumption is
that the only thing keeping massive
extra funding of schools
both from private individuals
billionaires you know
endowed whatever as well as the
government
probably could put in more i think what
keeps anybody from putting more into the
school system
is is what what
smart person pours money into
a broken system that can't be fixed
nobody right so there's you would be
forgiven for believing that whatever
money we have is a fixed
pot and then if we move some of it it
will be
less left over here certainly true in
the short run
but it seems to me that because of
teachers unions
they've created this broken and
unfixable system called the public
schools
and they're preventing competition
because the unions are so strong they
can prevent anybody from
competing with them they can just get
the laws changed and such
which they do so uh
here's the thing it seems to me that we
live in a country
where we could get unlimited funding
for let's say startup education
projects because so many people want it
it's such a obvious public good that i
think
billionaires would just open their
wallets the only thing that they lack
is something to fund which sounds weird
doesn't it
you know wouldn't your first assumption
be that schools are underfunded
and of course they are but there's a
very good reason
if you put more money into the bad
schools apparently it doesn't make that
much difference
because you know the system is broken
so without competition it wouldn't
matter how much money you put into it
nobody has really an incentive to
compete there is no competition
and that's because the teachers unions
all right
so just summarizing the
um the difference between uh let's say
the left's
philosophy and the rights and i've said
this before but you'll see it in all
all different topics is the left likes
to assume
that there's a it's a zero-sum game
meaning that there's a fixed pot of
wealth or resources
and if i have some of it that's
something you can't have
so if i have some that takes away what
could have been yours
that's not what the right tends to think
the right tends to
approach things from a perspective of
abundance
which is there's never a limited amount
of anything
you can make more how you would make
more money for
funding schools is by giving them better
things to fund
there's always a way to make more for
everybody but only the right seems to
think that's even a thing
the left seems to think uh it's a
limited amount we've got to get ours
and then everything falls apart
here's the most alarming thing that's
happening today that we're acting it
like it's not alarming i've now heard
three high-end attorneys who
understand the uh the legal you know
defense world three of them so far and i
think dershowitz was one
predicting that the facts of the matter
robert barnes was another
and it was just another one i saw people
really know what they're talking about
saying that it's unlikely
that the facts of the case and the law
will be used to decide the outcome
and that it's how the um i guess how the
jurors feel
you know the the emotional impact of the
whole thing
is almost certainly meaning you know
greater than 80
chance according to people who know what
they're talking about not me
i don't know what i'm talking about but
there's an 80
chance that there's an american citizen
an american citizen who is
innocent until proven guilty and we're
sitting here
like it's okay with the complete
knowledge that there's an 80
chance that he will go to jail for at
least 12 years
because he's a white male
now you're gonna say to yourself that's
not why it's because he freaking killed
a guy on video
that's why he's going to jail you know
if he goes to jail it's because he
killed the guy
right in front of us i get that right
that's a completely
legitimate point of view it may not be
technically exactly what happened
because you kind of need to know his
state of mind and such but certainly we
watched
we watched something that the
professionals have deemed a homicide
and i'm not arguing that it's a homicide
so certainly the human actions had
something to do with it but
still you have to support the system
right it's not always about the person
you know you could
imagine there are cases where you just
need to punish some person
you bend a rule to do it but can you can
you break the system in this case
and just say well and apparently this
wouldn't be the one time this happens
obviously
but why are we okay with this
why is it okay because
and i have to be more careful about how
they say that say this
i'm not saying that shelvin is innocent
or guilty that's actually irrelevant to
my point
my point is that his innocence or guilt
won't be part of what puts him in jail
or not
it's just not part of the decision that
ain't right
so what will be part of the decision if
not
the law and the facts and again this
isn't my opinion this is people who are
in the law and know what they're talking
about
if they're not going to be used isn't it
a racial
outcome and how is it not
really how is this not i don't want to
use the l word
because as soon as you use the l-y-c and
you know you know that word then it then
it becomes a whole you know it's a
distraction
but clearly the entire world
is watching him getting ready to go to
jail for
12 or more years because he's a white
male
now he might also let me be very careful
he might also be completely guilty
the i think the prosecution made a
pretty good case
but that's not why he's going to jail
for
according to the people who know what
they're talking about they're not even
going to look at that
they're just going to vote on how they
feel
how is that okay i guess we just don't
have an alternative right
nobody's got a better idea and so so
we'll just say well
okay here's my theory the only reason
that's okay is that we've been
brainwashed
that's my theory that you would not put
up with this
for a second if the
if the media had not told you to do it
not directly
but the media has created a situation
where this guy's guilty
and just requires him to be punished
right and that and that narrative
existed long before we even saw the
defense's case long before
we saw the prosecution's case which i
assert again
is very strong so i'm not saying he's
i'm not saying he's innocent of anything
prosecution made a good case it's just
not going to be used
to decide his fate i'm not cool with
that
i just don't know what to do about it so
here's a
interesting thing so now you know we
know this uh and
by the way fact check me on this
following thing because i don't follow
the vaccination stuff too
closely but my understanding is that the
j j vaccination is
sort of being pulled back temporarily
while they're looking into whether it's
causing some exotic uh or rare blood
problems but apparently ours
the state of our data and reporting is
so bad
that we don't know if it's rare
apparently it's kind of hard to tell
who's having what kind of reactions now
i hate to be a conspiracy theorist
theorist
he lied okay i love to be a conspiracy
theorist
if i could be one thing it would be a
conspiracy theorist
so i kind of like it
and here's my conspiracy theory
so you've got billions of dollars at
stake in these vaccinations
i guess the government is paying it but
billions of dollars
and you've got three competitors right
three big
pharmaceutical competitors two of them
are making this mrna newer kind of
vaccination which requires two shots
would you rather have something that's
newer
and you require two shots or something
that's been around so long
we understand the risks a little better
in terms of the technology
not the specific shot but the technology
and
you only need one which of those do you
like better well it's obvious
right it if you if you could take the
one that's always worked forever
and you only need one right
now here's the part i need to fact check
the people who are getting the
the second shot and having all the
symptoms
the j and j one doesn't have those side
effects right
can i get a fact check on that when i
say side effects i mean the
the feeling of the flu and like you got
knocked out and stuff
um and people are saying that the other
vaccinations had
some side effects too we just don't know
if they're significant
all right so on paper
the j and j shot would be better because
it's one
better one shot inside two better
because it doesn't have the side effects
that might make you lose a day of work
uh better because it's not new
technology although
let's acknowledge the new technology
might be way better
but it's new so you just have a little
less visibility right
so what are the odds that the problem
that j and j
is having are real you see where i'm
heading with this
do you know who is the biggest i think
just
you know visually it seems like who
would be the biggest
funder of the news it would be
pharmaceuticals wouldn't it
they're the biggest funders of the news
because they buy advertising on the news
and so the news has taken aside
basically now it doesn't look like it if
you're just consuming the news it
doesn't look like they
took aside it looks like they're just
reporting the news right
the news says the j thing has a problem
the news these are just the facts no
propaganda here right just the facts
uh our problem has been raised jane
jay's looking into it
a little bit more reporting a little bit
more reporting on that hey did you
notice a little bit more reporting
do you see this subtle difference
between
paid propaganda i'm not saying that's
happening by the way
i'm just saying could you tell the
difference between just
reporting the news and deciding that you
wanted to kill one of the shots
because the other two companies spend
more on advertising
which by the way i don't know if that's
the case i doubt that's exactly the case
but my problem is i used to live in the
world
where i could rule this out i could just
say to myself
i don't live in a world where some
company is going to start
false rumors about another company plant
stories in the media
just so they can sell more vaccinations
i certainly don't live in a world where
something like that could
yeah i do i do i'm not making a claim
there's there's no no allegation being
made here i'm just saying
we live in a world where you see this
and you say
is the coincidence that the
unambiguously best
shot just got ruled out by the media
is that a coincidence it could be
nothing but the news
all right i have no information that
would suggest this is anything but
exactly what's happening science spotted
some problems
science is cautious science pulled back
is looking into it that's all we know
but man we don't live in a world where
you can just assume that's what's
happening
we do live in a world where there's a
billion dollars on the
on the table if you can place a story in
the media
what what would you do if you worked for
a big company
and you personally could just get
insanely rich
if just just you could get a few
friendly reporters to just boost the
little story and maybe see if it gets
picked up by the other ones so you don't
have to bribe them
it'd be kind of tempting all you got to
do is give somebody a story that's
completely true
hey reporter this is totally true you
can check
yourself we've seen some problems with
side effects
with our competitors vaccination do you
think this is a story
i'll package it up for you so you don't
even have to do much research
here are the people to talk to here are
the data and the source and here it is
that'd be a good story wouldn't it
that's how the world works stories are
planted
they're not they're not always found a
big
big controversy about whether you should
wear masks after vaccination dr
fauci says that since you could still
get the virus
even vaccinated that means you could
still
in theory spread the virus because
anybody who has it can spread it
and therefore getting the vaccination dr
fauci says
is no excuse not to wear a mask
well dr j barakariya who appeared on fox
news argues this
he said that because of that argument dr
fauci is probably the number one
anti-vaxxer in the country boom reframed
boom here's his argument
uh dr uh dr j bhattacharya's argument
is that because fauci is telling people
they still have to wear
masks he's kind of telling them they're
not going to get enough benefit
from the vaccination he's also kind of
saying maybe
i'm not saying this but if you were a
conspiracy theorist
and you were already worried that these
vaccinations aren't even
real they're real by the way
i wouldn't worry about them not being
real but it plays into
every fear if you still have to wear a
mask
don't you say to yourself dr fauci
you've been wrong about masks before
maybe once or twice so everything about
this
is like a caution flag to people who are
already cautious
this is a pretty good argument it's also
a good reframe
so by reframing fauci as the the
obstacle the vaccinations and then
showing
a perfectly solid argument for why that
would be the case
well done persuasion-wise
now let me speculate about why
dr fauci might be saying we need masks i
think other people probably say it too
you see he's not alone but why would he
say that what are the possible reasons
he would say that when many of you
are saying no way i'm not going to wear
a mask after i get a vaccination
that's cray-cray well reason number one
dr fauci's job is not to make you happy
it's not in his job description so if he
had a choice
of you know keeping one extra person
alive
because of his you know tight tight
recommendations
versus you know 20 million people are
unhappy and god knows what happens
because of that
he's gonna pick the thing that he gets
you know
measured on how many people you keep in
alive so he's not
exactly not exactly he's completely the
wrong
person to give you advice
you get that right if you're a democrat
you think he's exactly the right person
he's the expert i mean if you're not an
epidemiologist
people are going to come after you but
you know who i would rather make that
decision nate silver
right now he got a lot of crap because
he said something about the statistics
of
of uh the pandemic and and people say
you're not a
you're not a uh epidemiologist you're
not
a virologist so what are you saying
about this no he's a guy who knows risk
management
it's a risk management question with
lots of variables
dr fauci's job is not to manage all the
variables
so when he gives you advice what should
you do
you should ignore it he's the wrong
person
suppose you're having a a brain tumor
and uh the gardener from across the
street comes over and says hey i
heard you had a brain tumor have you
considered you know stuffing weeds in
your ear
you wouldn't really listen to your
gardener because your gardener might be
very wise about
the wrong things the gardener is not
really who should give you advice
about your brain tumor and i would argue
that dr fauci is exactly the wrong
person to give you advice about wearing
a mask
because he's sort of not allowed to
consider all the variables
he's he's sort of the medical guy
so you just can't you can't look at
the whole risk management quality of
life situations it's just the wrong guy
and you should know that which is
nothing
nothing about him as a person he's just
not the right job for this
um here is how you would make this
decision let me walk it through you so
um is the real reason that
we want masks on everybody because the
non-vaccinated would start cheating
they'd say oh yeah there's no passports
yet so uh yeah i had my vaccination
uh i can go to the bar oh yeah don't
worry i
had my vaccination so
you have to worry because remember fauci
already told us masks don't work when
what he really meant early on in the
pandemic
was that there aren't enough of them so
we know fauci has lied
once really big lie about the value of
masks
all right he might say he was mistaken
so we'll let him have that
but we know he was you know wrong
because he changed his mind
or maybe he was right the first time
whatever but he changed his mind so he
was right he was wrong one of those
times
and um
so he might be just telling people to
wear masks because it's the only way you
can tell without without passports
it's the only way you can tell that the
that the people were not vaccinated
are also wearing masks we don't really
know the risk
of transmitting right has anybody told
you
what is what is the percentage risk that
a vaccinated person
could catch the virus now we know that
can happen
but then we also know that you have to
have a pretty good dose of it
to spread it and we know that the super
spreaders are most of the spread
how many super spreaders will there ever
be
who had the vaccination and if they were
a super spreader i mean this could be a
special case with
no immune system or something uh
but you know they were going to be
trouble anyway
right all right um
so i don't think you can figure out uh
what makes sense here and you're gonna
end up defaulting to
a lifestyle decision in my opinion you
will never have enough data
to know if it is wise or unwise to wear
masks once you're vaccinated
but if you have no data and it's
certainly not obvious
that it would make a difference and
maybe there's a little risk
i think you would admit there must be
some risk i feel as if
you know i'm very solidly and they don't
wear a mask after your
vaccinated camp but i don't think we
could know
you know you end up using your a hunch
or
your your instinct because you just
don't know but
everything we know suggests that masking
after vaccination
might approach just dumb right but you
have to be careful
your common sense can be misleading so
you never know
here's a trend that's happening i always
say that if you you know economics
and business models you understand how
business models
work uh that you can see the future
you can predict things because economics
can be kind of predict predictable in
some sense
and here's a trend that's happening it's
it's a really big deal
all right this following trend if you're
not watching this
you're really going to be blindsided by
what what could happen
really quickly it looks like this
there's a
subscription service for authors called
substack
have you all heard of it yet it's this
is pretty big deal
it's a real big deal actually it's
called sub stack
so if you're an author you can work
there and
at least at the moment some of those
notable authors people who have brought
an audience with them
are making up to half a million a year
by charging a subscription
for their regular writing at the same
time
new york times and wall street journal
writers are somewhere in 120
000 per year range
the sub stack writers can write anything
they want
oh there might there must be some terms
of service that they can't exceed you
know
they they couldn't go full nazi i'm sure
but in terms of you know standard
other platform uh censorship
and in terms of somebody telling them
from the top
you know like a like a ceo saying this
is what you're going to cover and this
is your narrative they don't have that
so substance because it's way more
profitable than working for one of these
propaganda you know legacy platforms
is going to suck off all of well
let me say that differently might absorb
all the best writers because why would
you work for one-fifth of what you could
earn
so sub-stack is going to suck all the
people away from the ad-based businesses
so if you're an advertising based
business you're in real trouble
because you're not going to be able to
hire talent and without that you're
you're dead
similarly there's a situation with uh
youtube
so youtube is you know ad revenue plus
you could subscribe but if you're a
creator
making stuff for youtube you would make
a small fraction
of what the same creator would make on
locals so i put a lot of my
content that you don't see here most of
the micro
lessons on success and persuasion and
stuff
uh fitness and whatnot i put those on
locals
because if i only put them on youtube
it'd be
you know just a fraction of the same
financial impact
and now youtube has a response because
they have a subscription service
if you are a consumer of youtube
and you should be it's like the best
thing out there right as much as i
complain
about youtube from you know this or that
as a as a platform and a service
oh my god it's good it's like just the
best thing
uh youtube is but it's not so good if
you have to watch the ads
so for my money it's one of the few
things that's just so totally worth the
subscription
however that does not help the the
creators as much
you know that's that's just good for the
people watching it so i highly recommend
youtube if you are
a consumer for creators they might be
able to
do a little better in some other
platform locals being
being the one i would recommend because
that's where i am by the way uh
full disclosure i have a small uh equity
stake in locals just so you know
all right um apparently we're having a
mass shooting just about every day now
and even way more than last year and
last year was crazy
now we don't know how much of this is
because the pandemic right
we don't know how much of this is
because of i don't know
police may be pulling back it's hard to
know
exactly what's behind this hole but i'll
tell you one thing that's definitely
behind it
and experts you know talk about this all
the time the copycat
copycat people imagine a world
where all the news wasn't covering these
mass shootings all the time
what would people even think of to do
if you didn't know there was such a
thing as a mass shooting it was
happening once a day
and you had some kind of feelings of
violence
what would you do well you wouldn't even
think of it
it's it's pressed into our heads to the
point where it's literally the first
thing you think of if you have a bad day
um yeah now we we have to know it's
happening
so you can't not cover it but i would
certainly make
some kind of law that says the only
coverage is the
statistics and none of the coverage is
um human so that you just couldn't show
any footage of the event all you could
show is the box score
you know three people dead suspect dead
boom tuesday and at least you know
what's going on
you know maybe west city etc so you
wouldn't be in the dark
but you wouldn't be encouraging it the
same way uh and it could be that the
shooter you know video games may happen
may maybe
have an effect on people's psychology as
well
but man we're in a situation where the
news
basically causes these mass shootings
let me say that again
the news causes the mass shootings
now one of the things that confuses
people is the difference between
legal responsibility and cause and
effect
cause and effect is just physics this
caused this because this caused this
legal responsibility can be this whole
separate thing right
so in terms of who's responsible for
shooting people it's the person with the
gun
from a legal standpoint if all you're
looking at is the law
we all agree it's the person with the
gun who's the one responsible
but if you're looking at a chain of
cause and effect outside of the context
of the law
it's the news the news makes the mass
shootings
and then the news covers them and the
news makes more money
and then they generate another one and
so this is the news business basically
is the cause
um all right let's see what else we got
going on
uh rob henderson
who writes about human nature he's a
good follow on twitter
rob henderson so look for him and he was
talking about a
new survey that came out that said
conservative women i always talk about
who's the happiest you know
conservatives or liberals men and women
and their top line result is
conservative women
are particularly blissful forty percent
say they are very happy that makes them
slightly happier than
conservative men so both conservative
women and conservative men
fairly happy compared to the average and
significantly happier than
liberal women so that's
you know pretty far down the list but
the unhappiest are liberal men
only a fifth of liberal men consider
themselves very happy
are you surprised
now i was trying to think before i got
on here today i was thinking
all right i should probably talk about
at least what the possible reasons are
you know i can at least mention a few
reasons
but you know what stymied me there were
too many reasons
there are so many reasons why this must
be true that
i got tired listing them i just saw here
somebody here say low t you're not wrong
i think there is actually literally no
joke
probably a scientifically valid
difference between the testosterone
levels
of uh of conservative versus liberal men
and i don't think that's i think that
would actually hold up
like literally um and we know that your
testosterone
level and influences your happiness is
pretty direct
so that might be part of it let me uh
speculate on some other possible causes
this is just speculation
so we're just being you know we're just
being idiots you know pretending we're
scientists okay so don't take any of
this too seriously
one possibility is that uh conservatives
are more likely to follow
traditional gender roles
yeah i said it said it right out loud
how about that now uh
you might know that i consider myself
left of bernie on especially the social
issues and i certainly don't feel like
anybody should ever be pressured
to do any traditional gender roles
like i i don't want anybody to feel any
pressure
for traditional gender roles if if
that's not your thing
you you know you don't fit into that i'm
all for you
just you know follow follow what makes
you happy so
no suggestion that you should do this
i'm just saying
there's a really good chance that this
is one of the
keys to happiness and my take on it is
that
whatever gets you closest to your
biological
evolutionary uh truth
is what makes you happiest what i mean
by that is if you're on the path
toward toward finding a mate
creating creating new people and taking
care of them
that will always feel like some kind of
a satisfying happy thing
now the there's lots of trials and
tribulations but at least you'll feel
like you have meaning
etc but again not everybody's doing that
there just might be more of that
happening
on the conservative side and it might
just connect them a little bit more
closely with their biological reality
perfectly optional but it might work
of course religion there might you know
there's seems to be a difference in
religiosity and while i am not religious
myself there's no doubt that it makes
people happy
right it's a i'm pro-religion very
pro-religion
because i observe it makes people happy
and
why would i deny anybody happiness um
here's another possibility tinder
tinder you know the tinder is ruining
the world for young people right
oh not all young people apparently the
top you know one or two percent of
good-looking men
are having a great time on tinder it's
all the other ones who are not getting a
date
so if something like tinder and let's
say
online ability to find people is
allowing
pretty much all women to simply pick the
the most
exceptional men and ignore everybody
else should we not have a massive
problem with male loneliness
and would it not be let's say more
pronounced in the
shall we say less
muscular part of the world
would that be fair do you think that
people could tell the difference
between a beefy trump supporter
and a maybe didn't quite go to the gym
hillary supporter do you think if you're
flipping on tinder
you can pick out the ones with the most
testosterone
i feel like there might be some kind of
a correlation there
because i i do think that i i do think
if you did a scientific experiment where
you just said here's a bunch of male
faces
just tell us which ones have the most
testosterone
i think people could do it you know
better than uh chance would suggest so
if it's true and again
you could fact check this i don't know
if it's true but observationally it
feels like it could be
that conservative men are more likely to
have a little
especially young have a little extra
testosterone
and maybe when you're flipping on
flipping through tinder you can see it
and maybe they get more dates i don't
know maybe
again fact-check me on that if there's
any way
let me all right so but here's my
favorite one i made this one up just for
fun
imagine you're planning a party okay
you're the party planner
and there are two let's say groups of
people you hang out with but you don't
want to mix them together
so you're going to have a party and
you're either going to invite one of
these groups
or the other but you're not going to
have them at the same party because
it won't work and let me describe these
two groups
and you tell me which one you'd invite
to your party
one group believes that america is a
toxic
wasteland of bigotry that's based on
race gender
and sexual orientation so if you invite
that group
that's what you get the other group
which will remain nameless
thinks that america is a great place to
pursue happiness
because everyone is equal under the law
now
your party has to have one of those two
groups
which one do you think would make a
better party
so i feel like there are really good
and somewhat obvious reasons why liberal
men
are the unhappiest they've ever been and
i don't think it's funny
you know even though i'm laughing at it
there's something about the situation
that's funny
but when you get to the you know
individual person who's dying of
loneliness and doesn't know why
that's not funny i mean that that's
legitimately
like a big big problem so i don't want
to minimize the problem but
we do kind of know what the problem is i
think we know what the source is
all right you want to go to the white
board are you ready okay
i believe that one of the problems that
liberals have
that conservatives have less of and
again everybody's different
but sort of a generality is that
um sometimes
and maybe i shouldn't even make this
liberal versus conservative yeah just
forget that part
this is just different ways of looking
at the world
if there are two ways to look at success
and this is just
a slice of success right not not all of
it and i'm going to reframe something
for you
wouldn't you believe in your common
sense
and the way your brain is organized
doesn't it make sense
that in order to succeed
doesn't it make sense that you should
understand the facts as well as you
could
how could that not be true the better
command you have
of reality and the facts the more likely
you'll be successful
how many of you agree with that
statement the better you understand the
facts
the more successful you'll be we'll see
the comments if you agree with that
because there's a little bit of problem
with that
as logical as that sounds
you can't tell what the facts are
didn't you used to think you could you
used to think
you could tell the facts now in a world
that doesn't exist
but like a hypothetical world where you
you could actually tell what was true
that would be a pretty good strategy for
success oh
the more you know about what's true the
more you can craft the right strategy
that makes perfect sense but you don't
live in that world
you have a perfect strategy for a world
that just doesn't exist
how many more times do you have to see
in the last 12 months
that the facts change right in front of
you what you thought was true yesterday
just
isn't true today so if you use what's
true
as your main filter you're just going to
run into a wall over and over again
sometimes it'll work great but there'll
be a lot of walls
now let's say you were irrational and
you said to yourself
i don't know why this thing works but it
seems to work so i'll just keep doing it
well what are the facts you're using to
determine you should do that i don't
really have any
because your life is mostly this stuff
where you test stuff and you observe
what happened
if you walk down to one door of your
house and every day a baseball hit you
in the head
but you couldn't figure out where it was
coming from or why it always hit you in
the head when you walked out one door
but not the other
wouldn't you still stop walking out that
door you wouldn't have a randomized gold
standard
trial that is scientifically valid
but you still have to make decisions so
if one door always hurts you and the
other door doesn't
you're gonna do what works
without knowing anything about the facts
so if i can sell you just on the concept
first now let me fill in some examples
because until you see some examples this
is just nonsense right
here are some examples here's something
that's true
as far as we know that bigotry exists in
the united states especially
well that's just what we're talking
about bigotry exists and it influences
the outcomes of things and that it's
unfair
that feels like those are facts in the
united states bigotry exists
it influences outcomes and it's unfair
so that's what's true
so suppose you built a strategy around
what's true
how would that work out for you well you
would be miserable
and you would probably be directing your
attentions in the wrong places
but you'd be working on facts suppose
you worked on what works instead
let me give you an example without being
acting as if you control your own
destiny by your actions
is that true do you control your own
destiny by your actions
it feels like that's only a little bit
true right well yeah
somewhat but what about all these other
things those are pretty big
right i'm not saying it's true that you
can control your future by your actions
what i'm saying is that everybody who
believes it's true
gets a better outcome
you're going to start to see it in a
minute right following what is true
throws you completely off the path of
success
following what um you're simply acting
like is true
which is that you control your own
outcomes
will make you act in that way and you're
going to get pretty good results
let me give you another one
this might be true that you're not the
best at a given task
so let's say there's something you're
going to be doing and it's just true
you're not one of the good ones at this
thing so if you
if you base your strategy on based on
what's true
you're going to be going into it with
low confidence and what does that
predict
well low confidence predicts low
performance
but suppose instead of dealing with
what's true
that you're bad at this whatever this
thing is you say to yourself
i'm going to exceed expectations you
just tell yourself that yeah i'm totally
going to exceed
expectations i'm going to nail it this
time is it true
well there's no truth or fact do it
whatsoever it's just something in your
head
but it would make you perform better a
little bit of confidence
might calm you down and you might
perform better than you expected
so again if you if you start your
strategy based on
the facts and what's true you you just
run off the trail
if you just imagine a world that's true
it's very useful here's another one
um here's a fact science can't prove god
exists
all right hold on hold on there are lots
of different religions
so for this example let's say that
science can't prove
that somebody else's religion exists
okay
they can't prove somebody else's
religion exists yours is fine
so the facts are that science can't
prove somebody else's
religion exists but it's also true that
religion makes people happy
definitely religion makes people happy
makes them more successful i think they
live longer right
and healthier i believe that the science
is completely consistent about that
so should you go with what's true which
is ah
i can't do a science experiment and find
me some god
so i don't know if i can deal with it
that way but i suppose you just go with
what works
seven generations of your family worship
god they all did great
so you do it and it works out great
let me give you another one um
let's say unions are good for workers
and we should support them
doesn't that sound completely reasonable
now i don't want to get
into too much the you know the argument
of unions are good or bad
but i would say most people most
americans would say
unions have a role and they've made the
world better especially for workers
so isn't it a fact that unions are good
for workers
and we should support them and if you
took that as a fact
you'd have a certain set of policies but
here's a there's another view
teachers unions teachers unions don't
work
because their opponents are children
the only union that has as is
opponents children
you you can't take the teachers unions
and throw them in with the argument
in which it's adults against adults
the teachers union is the only one where
it's adults in the teachers unions
whose opponents are literally children
that's not where you want a union i want
a union
where i've got a powerful force let's
say the owners of the company on one
side
and then the the workers uh you know
they get together
to equal the force then you've got a
nice competitive
you know productive competitive
situation everybody gets what they want
that's not the teachers unions the
teachers unions are
they're treating the children as the
enemy that's not fair
now i know technically you know they're
negotiating with their bosses for raises
but that's not how it works out right so
here's my point
every time you get stuck in what are the
facts you're probably leaving out some
options
that might be better no two situations
are alike
clearly there are plenty of cases where
you should just follow the facts
maybe you can recognize them when you
see them but my point is
that following the facts slavishly is a
loser
strategy because you don't know the
facts
and believing you do is what leads you
over the cliff
all right um
i got one more story here maybe two
in the washington examiner uh
writer eddie scary versus
s-c-a-r-r-y scary
is writing about how the media is
treating the duante right
tragic shooting and death
you all know that story right that's the
one where the police officer
mistook a taser for a handgun
and killed this guy when in the attempt
hoping to taser him but kill them um
and so columbia university professor
sarah ceo she weighed in on it
i guess in the new york times and she
said this that traffic stops
should not be harrowing or dangerous
experiences but
too often they are for people of color
and that she proposed that
if somehow you know we just uh a camera
had picked up his license plate and just
sent him a ticket
then he never would have been stopped
and there never would have been any
opportunity for anybody to get hurt
is that a good idea well as
eddie scary points out that's not
exactly
covering the whole context here right
the context is
that he the only reason there was a
problem
is that he had a warrant an arrest
warrant i think a weapon was involved in
the arrest warrant i can't remember what
the
warrant was for and he resisted arrest
and then there was a tragic mistake uh
of the confusion of the the taser
so is it is it fair to say
that uh if if we could have changed
things
police-wise we would have gotten a
better result
i don't know so as uh any scary rights
you know um the the idea that
um wright ended up dead because of
expired car tags which was the original
reason for pulling him over i guess
uh and even though he did it wasn't
expired it just wasn't posted in the
right place
and something about an air freshener
that nobody believes has anything to do
with that
but why do you think he got shot do you
think he got shot
because he got stopped
or did he get shot because he resisted
arrest
which of those is the truth
well you could argue about this all day
long and obviously you needed
everything to happen the way it did for
it to go the way it did but let me
suggest
this every time somebody says to me
there's no way to reduce police funding
and still get a good result i always
feel like that's
a limit of imagination i do not believe
that it would be impossible to defund
the police you know in
in some percentage not all the police of
course but i do think you could get a
whole bunch of
technical advantages to to lower the
economics of it
and get rid of danger let me give you a
specific example
uh suppose you said to detroit i'll just
pick a pick a city
where there's you know gun violence and
police
stopping people you say detroit
we're going to let the big car
manufacturers who want to build
self-driving cars
bid for your city and then they're just
going to sort of own the roads
and they'll be able to put their own
self-driving cars there and maybe phase
them in over time whatever it is
and and detroit will become the test bed
for i'll pick a company um let's say
it's tesla
but it could be any big car company and
and tesla will own detroit
and eventually they'll have the
franchise that if you want to call a car
like an uber it's going to be a tesla
and that's all there is
and they'll just own the city and the
advantage is that the
cars will all be networked so that you
know
everything knows where everything is and
doesn't bump into everything
so under that situation how would you
ever have a traffic stop
because the self-driving cars will never
be pulled over for a traffic violation
so the entire reason for pulling
somebody over is gone
now what are the odds that someday we'll
have self-driving cars 100
there's no chance that's not going to
happen what are the odds that someday
we'll only have self-driving cars well
that might take longer
but it's 100 i don't think there's any
chance
that we're going to let perfectly safe
self-driving cars
on the road with you know crazy organic
you know defective humans driving them
that's crazy
you know maybe cars will be in
recreational areas but you're not going
to use them for basic transportation in
the future
there's no chance that's going to happen
in the future so that might be 20 years
away but suppose we just sped it up
and said let every major car company
adopt a city
maybe you start with one block or
whatever make that just the self-driving
car
you know area then you expand it until
you own the city
what the car manufacturers and and by
the way the car manufacturer could be
apple computer
it could be google right because a lot
of people are going to be making
self-driving cars
and you just say you own the city but
you also have to do all the
transportation you got to make it
affordable
and you just have eliminated traffic
stops
now how do you arrest somebody who's got
an arrest warrant
if you don't stop them in a car well i
somewhat tongue-in-cheek said the police
could have an override button
and just make your car drive to the
police station so you could be you know
safely get taken out of the car without
trouble
i don't think literally you want the car
to drive to the police station
but it could yeah it could
now i heard some people say that we'll
never have
self-driving cars everywhere because it
could get hacked
and then you know what would happen then
if it got
hacked and i would just say that every
new technology has the same kind of
problem every new technology
i used to work in a bank when the very
first atms were being
introduced and the argument against them
was
nobody's going to trust these machines
with their money
and of course atms are everywhere i'm
sure when the airplanes were invented
well i know the thinking was well you're
never going to have
like an industry of travel by airplane
because there's no way you can make an
airplane safe
right or elon musk
you're never going to have a rocket that
shoots up
you know unloads his payroll payload not
payroll
sort of unloads his payroll too unloads
his payload
and then comes back down and somehow
stays
upright until it lands on a platform in
the ocean
that's not gonna work but it does
so uh yeah self-driving cars are
guaranteed
you just it's just how long it will take
and flying cars are guaranteed too
but not until batteries are cost
effective and they're almost there
flying cars are pretty much here just a
little bit more
in battery efficiency which is
guaranteed and you'll have your flying
car
the the laws will be the hard part
nothing is on your percent you say well
okay that's true
i'll back that up to 98
you know self-driving cars are going to
change everything
imagine if you could just go on vacation
anywhere you wanted in the united states
or you know wherever you are and you
could just tell the car to
to go somewhere like i have this rule
that if i'm driving a car
i'm not on vacation and unfortunately if
you happen to be the
the oldest adult male
with whatever group you're traveling
with you're usually going to be the one
driving a car
and anytime i'm driving a car i am not
on vacation i'm just working
that's just a job so that's where i draw
the line
if i have to drive a car that's work
that's not a vacation
all right that's all for me and i will
talk to you tomorrow
