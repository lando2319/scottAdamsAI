hey everybody
good morning and welcome to the best
part
of the entire day
week month i don't know it could be that
good but today will be
well let's just say provocative
are you ready for provocative well you
know what good
goes well with provocation you probably
do
all you need is a cup of margaret glass
i think you're jealous or steiner can't
you juggle
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
that's right coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
well just about everything better it's
called the simultaneous
and it happens now go
oh that's so good
so good well there was a shocker in the
olympics last night
the american basketball team lost
to france i'm supposed to feel bad about
that right
is there anybody here who looked at that
story that the american basketball
team i guess they lost it's a they had a
25
game olympic winning streak counting
prior olympics
and this snapped it they lost 83 to 76
how many people said to themselves
lol
i hate the fact that i'm rooting against
my own country
but i am i am
i'm rooting against our basketball
players
because they've they've made such fools
of themselves
with the you know the protests and stuff
and by the way i agree with their point
you know i don't have any conflict with
what they're trying to do
i'm all on board but the way they've
done it
has so discredited their sport and them
as athletes
that i kind of am glad they're france
wanton and i'm not i don't know should i
feel good about that
i don't think i should on the other hand
it's kind of healthy that you know
that you're not obsessed with your own
team winning all the time
there's probably something a little bit
healthy in that well the tokyo olympics
uh the broadcasters
uh are trying to curb the sexualization
of the female athletes
apparently in past olympics it was uh
this is even it's funny to even think
that uh this happened just a few years
ago
literally the last olympics that the
camera people would
focus on female body parts just you know
totally sexualizing the athletes
and i'm thinking to myself okay i get
i get that they want to be less you know
on the nose about it
but let's be serious can we be serious
can we all be serious for a moment the
olympic athletes
are literally chosen to be the best
mating prospects on the planet earth
that's not the point of it the point of
it is the the sports etc
but the the effect of it is you pick
the most um genetically superior people
who have also shown dedication and all
these qualities
they are literally the people you most
want to have children with
if i were a woman and i could have a
child with anybody and you said well how
about
an olympic athlete somebody won a gold
medal
how about that you'd probably just say
okay i'm done searching
i'll take the olympic gold medal winning
person because that's going to be some
pretty good genes
they've all been tested right i've been
tested through sports
so how in the world can you desexualize
an event where all the most sexually
um desirable people from a mating
perspective you know not from a purely
recreational point of view
but your most basic mating instinct
is set on fire when you see the most
perfect humans
that's how it works you can't take the
biology out of it
who in the world can look at the most
perfect specimens
all within this you know this
reproductive age
and have no effect i mean really if you
can look at
olympic athletes and not get a boner
good for you oh i'm not sure i've ever
done it
i'm just i mean i'm exaggerating a
little bit of course
all right uh here's the fake news of the
day you ready for the fake news
uh president biden is spending more than
2 billion to halt
border wall construction apparently it
costs
3 million every day to hire contractors
to guard the steel and concrete that
they're not going to use
because he's not going to build the wall
now
is that real news or is that the fake
news
what do you think do you think that
biden is really spending two billion
dollars to halt
the construction of the wall
it's true news that's fake it's the
worst kind
it's probably i'm guessing it's probably
a completely true statement of fact
but it's also fake news here's why
everything you shut down costs money
that's it any project you shut down
costs you extra money for the shutdown
for all the normal things
exactly what you would imagine you've
got contracts maybe you have to pay
people off
you got to guard your assets you've got
to get rid of them you've got to move
stuff
it's expensive so why should you think
about the fact that biden is going to
spend 2 billion
to avoid spending what another 25
billion
unfortunately unfortunately that's how
it works
so to report this as some kind of like
bad news where he's doing the wrong
thing
no the story is he he altered the wall
one once you say the story is we've
halted the wall
it's gonna cost you two billion dollars
just to stop it that's
so pretending that there's something
wrong here
when the democrats would say oh that's
worth two billion
somebody says the money is already
approved but that's irrelevant you can
underprove money
what exactly is the coven strategy for
the country
do you remember um was a year ago or
plus
a year and a half ago when the strategy
we thought was to flatten the curve
now flattening the curve didn't work as
we all
can observe but was it a reasonable
strategy
to give it a test i say yes i would say
that the flatten the curve was number
one
a very clear statement of intent that's
a plus
it was very clear it was a gas
because we were in a pandemic and we
didn't know exactly what was going to
work
but it was a logical thing to try it
didn't work
but was it reasonable to try it
absolutely
to see if it did work we didn't know
what else to do
so um
what is our strategy now now that that
strategy didn't work
it looks like the strategy is to get to
90
vaccination and call it a day but i feel
like that's
that's just one off from where it needs
to be
i feel like the strategy should be to
get everybody infected
but after vaccination because we know
now that
vaccination doesn't stop the spread
um and i think we also know that
everybody's going to get infected
but you don't want to get the long-haul
you know the bad version
and die from the virus so the very best
situation would be to get lots of
already vaccinated people also infected
and to get maybe children infected if
if they're better off that way you know
there's some controversy about that
but they might be better off just give
them the the real coronavirus
protection and maybe the next one
doesn't hurt him as much
so i'll just put that out there that i
believe that the government's
strategy is not articulated
but under the trump administration
the the flatten the curve i think was
well articulated
like you knew exactly what that was it
just didn't work good try smart to try
it
just didn't work i i i would take no
credit away from anybody
who tried something reasonable just
because it didn't work all right uh
rasmussen
is reporting they did a poll on the
media's reporting on covet 19
and asks this question do you think the
media are reporting accurately
on safety and effectiveness of covet 19
vaccines
50 of republicans said no
what 50
50 of republicans said the news is
basically lying to him on vaccines
now that's no surprise right because of
fake news but this is a scientific
thing or it should be as opposed to a
political thing
you'd expect the news to lie to you on
political things that's just our
daily experience but on science
do you really expect the news to lie to
you on science
well half of republicans say yes even 26
percent of democrats
say that the media isn't doing a good
job on
reporting on vaccines so i asked this
question on social media i said i wonder
if the reason
that people don't trust vaccinations is
that the people promoting the
vaccinations
are the four least credible entities in
the united states
who is less credible than number one our
government
nobody trusts the government i mean i'm
sure that's true in every country right
how about the news the fake news
industry
you can't trust the news the news
absolutely can't be trusted we don't
have many alternatives
but you definitely can't trust the news
if you've been
awake for the last two years that should
be obvious
how about the social media companies
that are deciding what messages get out
and which ones are suppressed
can you trust them no no
you can't for yeah it's not like they're
scientists for the fir
in the first place and number four
scientists themselves
can we trust science well fifty percent
of peer-reviewed
uh studies end up being
fifty percent and even the things that
science gets right which is lots of
stuff
you know science is a miracle and we all
love science
but even when it gets something right
it's the exception i mean most
things are bad hypotheses theories that
don't work out
tests that don't quite prove what you
wanted them to prove
science is pretty messy stuff so should
you trust it
well you can certainly trust that it's a
good process
and a good system i think that's fair
but what you can't trust is that you
know it got it right at any moment in
time
because science will conclude things and
then find out they were wrong and then
change their mind which is
it's supposed to do all right i'm
looking at a very funny meme on locals
right now
if you're if you're watching the stream
on the locals platform
you're you're seeing uh the comments
have images
as opposed to youtube where you could
just do text and then
somebody's showing a beam of me doing
the depression of one of the democrats
on the
texas bus the ones who escaped
it's pretty hilarious you have to trust
me on that anyway
should you be surprised that there are
so many people who don't want to take a
vaccination
when the people telling you to take it
are our government the fake news
industry
social media companies and scientists
who haven't done
so well lately in terms of credibility
science is still great
science is still great we're not
anti-science it's just that it's a messy
process and everybody understands that
now
so let's uh let's take this as our major
theme
the credibility of our institutions
right because i'm going to talk about
this in
other stories nancy pelosi just put adam
kinzinger on the january 6 committee
now if you don't follow politics that
doesn't mean much to you
you just said to yourself oh there's a
committee to look into the january 6
riots at the capitol and you want some
democrats and you want some republicans
to make it bipartisan
and so nancy pelosi put a republican on
there
if you didn't know anything about the
back story you'd say oh well that looks
pretty good
got some republicans you got some
democrats you're all set right
there is literally nobody in the
republican party who is less
credible on this question than adam
kinziger
literally nancy pelosi reached into the
void of
you know uh 300 some million americans
and found the one least credible person
on this specific
specific question because he's a trump
hater and he's making his brand
as being anti-trump and talking about
this issue in particular
he's literally the last person
you'd want to put on the committee
if you're even a little bit serious
right
he's the last person you put on it but
of course she's responding to mccarthy
who pulled all of his five
nominees off because they didn't like
two of them because they were too
political
and then she goes and puts the most
political person on there that you
possibly put on there
is she even trying is the government
even trying to be credible
this doesn't even show like a little bit
of effort
there's no effort here at all to be
credible
so and do you think that pelosi is
complaining about people not believing
the government that they should take
vaccinations
of course she is does she not realize
that she's the source of the lack of
credibility
or one of the biggest ones right you
can't have it both ways you can't do
ridiculously
non-credible things and then they ask
people to put a needle in their arm
no no the person who puts adam kinzinger
on the january 6 committee can't tell
you a thing
about your health can we get that clear
anybody who would be this ridiculous to
put adam kinzinger on this committee
completely
non-credible thing to do and that's the
dumb ass
that's going to tell you what to do with
your health i'm sorry
you have to be a little bit a little bit
credible
just a little bit before we're going to
listen to your
i'm not telling you not to get
vaccinations by the way
so um here is a little thread that
i found so interesting that i want to
share it to you some of you know
i've had some back and forth with a
twitter user
named anomaly or uh at legendary energy
as his twitter
and he's i guess you'd put him in i
don't like to label people if they don't
label themselves
but for the purpose of this story let's
say a
uh a skeptic of some of the covid
related
vaccines and masks and stuff so we'll
put him in the skeptic
category i'm not sure if he would label
himself that way but
um just for the story and
he said that we're talking about the
vaccinations and why there's some
hesitancy
he suggests it's not because of the
credibility of the people recommending
it
but he says most people are smart enough
to do the research
on how the companies manufacturing them
have zero
liability for side effects while they
quietly take their past products off the
market for cancer-causing carcinogens
and settle big cases for fraud foreign
bribery and false marketing
so the implication here is that you
could do your own research
and then when you did that you'd be all
set you could make a reasonable decision
how many of you would agree with the
basic
the basic setup how many would you agree
that you could do your own research and
come to a reasonable
good opinion i'm seeing in the comments
uh it's true
yes i knew all of that somebody says uh
over on locals where people are much
better informed
they're almost all saying no
so we've got a little dichotomy here the
people on locals who have been watching
my content
more probably are more likely to say no
you can't do that
and and the people on uh
now on youtube most people are saying no
all right so it looks like we're closer
to agreement now
just watching the comments go by all
right thank you
so the people watching me have gotten
the message and what i responded to was
zero people are smart enough to do that
kind of research
now do you notice the persuasion do you
think that
zero people in the whole world can do
this kind of research
it's sort of like an over claim right
that's what gets your attention
because i thought hard about saying
almost nobody
could do this research and then i
thought no
nobody can like literally nobody can
there are people that you think can
but you don't know you might say to
yourself yeah a person with certain
qualifications could totally do their
own research and come to a good decision
no they can't no they can't because the
things you need to research
don't exist you would be looking at
unknowns
so how do you compare one set of
unknowns to another
set of unknowns the the unknown risk
that is what's the risk of long covet
for you
you don't know what's the risk of
getting the vaccination if it's the
pfizer versus the moderna
versus the j and j oh you don't really
know
i mean you might know some statistics
but it doesn't doesn't apply to you
right so everything that you can look up
doesn't quite
work as a statistic or it doesn't apply
to you you just be guessing
so um
and then i got some agreement from some
smart people uh
if you here's a good recommendation for
a twitter follow
machiavelli's underbelly so just
google that machiavelli's underbelly and
the
twitter handle is uh at mmm
3ms underscore machiavelli and he says
agreed agreeing with me that zero people
could do this
and he adds that google's very existence
gave people the wrong impression that
they are capable of doing their own
research
for whatever reason people don't
understand
that google is a product where one of
its features
is making you feel like your search was
successful
now when you first hear that it doesn't
quite register you have to think about
it just for a moment
that google wouldn't have a product like
you wouldn't use it
unless when you used it you felt
successful
do you buy that then nobody would use a
google search engine
unless using it made you feel you got
good results
so the entire product is designed
by its nature to make you feel you got
good results and that you're a good
researcher
yeah it is a good insight that's why i
read it
and adam dopamine also on
twitter says google search equals
confirmation bias generator
right when you google things how often
does it come up with the answer you want
it
pretty often you think that's a
coincidence do you think that if a
somebody who is against
masks and thought they didn't work if
they did a google search on
do masks work what result would they get
a skeptic would get results to say masks
don't work
suppose you believe masks do work and
then you google it
what do you think the google search
would tell you who tell you they work
you want you doubt that try it yourself
if you doubt
that what i just said is true just try
it if you're a
mask skeptic and you say they don't work
just google it
and watch how you can prove that you're
right and then ask somebody who's
a a masked believer to just separately
do their own google search and simply
tell you
if they found what they thought was true
watch how both of you will say i googled
it and i'm right
google is a confirmation bias generator
that's what it does now if you don't
realize
that it's doing that in addition to also
giving you good information
i'm not saying it's all like fake
information or something it's all real
it's just that you can look into any
corner of it that you choose and your
confirmation bias
will tell you you found what you needed
now people who don't understand
these human
let's say foibles the way we think and
the way we are so easily
fooled by confirmation bias would
imagine that you can do this thing
called research do your own research i
tell you this example all the time
there used to be a low-cost
stock brokerage service that used to its
main
advertisement you probably saw it on tv
was that
you could do your own research and it
would show all these
really wise looking regular people like
i'm going to do my own research on these
stocks ah
yeah you know because i'm pretty smart i
i've got a
four-year degree in marketing so if i
just
do my own research i'm going to know how
to invest like warren buffett
because i just looked for stuff and i
found it put it all together with my big
brain
and then i figured out how to research
how to invest better
do you know how many people are capable
of doing their own research and then
beating the averages over an extended
period of time
none it's not even a thing
you couldn't find one investment expert
in the world who would tell you that's a
good idea
not zero
let me say it again there is no
financial expert
who would tell you that you can do your
own research
this is not a thing do you know who else
can't do their own research and come up
with good
individual stock recommendations
the experts there are two categories of
people who can't do that ever
this is not a thing one is people have
no experience
the other is the people who have the
most experience in the world
and everybody in between it's just not a
thing
you can't just google up some research
on a company
it's all just a bunch of lies and
guesses and probability and
we're not smart enough to do any of that
so instead all of the experts
and again all of them would tell you
don't do that
they tell you just diversify that's the
only thing you can do which is what i'd
tell you to do
all right and then anomaly legendary
energy came back at me after i made my
comment
and he said zero people lol
okay i had to add the attitude to it
because i feel that was in there
um okay yep zero people could do their
own research
now let me say it again zero people
literally if you think you're the one
you think you're the
the golden child the first person in the
world who was able to do this thing that
nobody's ever done
okay but you're probably not the golden
child
and you probably can't do magic just
like everybody else
so that's what i showed him an article
in the atlantic
um well first of all he said this is
anomaly again legendary energy
said alex berenson who you know is a as
a
well-known critic on masks and vaccines
and stuff
he said alex berenson would run circles
around you scott
you have possibly the most embarrassing
takes on the pandemic
and you've been consistently wrong not
sure if it's your ego
your fear your desperation to justify
your decision to get inoculated
or you know you're lying well at least i
have options
it could be my ego my fear my
desperation
to justify my inoculation or it could be
my lying are there any other
possibilities they left out
or or we've covered them all it's just
my ego my fear my desperation
to justify my decision or am i lying
it's going to be one of those so what
have i taught you about how
narcissists respond to
being shown they're wrong
how do they respond when you show
they're wrong
they attack the messenger don't they
where and here is somebody where is
anomaly mentioning what i got wrong
if he did mention what i got wrong do
you know what would be on the list
i think it's the only thing that would
be on the list i believe it's the only
thing
the only thing that would be on the list
of things i got wrong
would be that i said early on that the
who and the cdc were lying to you
and that masks do work and now
the top experts of a hundred percent of
industrialized nations
agree with me now could i be wrong
absolutely yeah someday could we find
out the masks made things worse or
didn't work at all
absolutely i keep that possibility
completely open
but at the moment every expert
in every industrialized country
agrees with me so if i'm wrong i'm open
to that
i'm open to it could be i mean i've been
wrong on things where i agreed with the
experts before
how weird would that be not weird at all
but
i believe that would be his only example
and yet he's sure that
i've got all kinds of problems with
vaccinate i guess he thinks i'm wrong on
vaccinations as well
but how can i be wrong on vaccinations
when my opinion is this
you can't weigh the risks or the
benefits nobody can
so i took uh i took a shot at it based
on the fact that i couldn't
compare the risks but the coward
i like to call out the idiots
when they when they make comments
in this case tyler pancratz
he goes the coward scott adams try to
justify your opinion
you believe that the vaccinations are
dangerous
right and you think
that i got the vaccination because i'm a
coward
so you believe that i did the more
dangerous thing
because i'm afraid is that your opinion
that i consciously took the more
dangerous path
according to you because of my cowardice
make a decision either i'm a
coward and i'm afraid of the vaccination
or i'm not just be consistent that's all
all right coward i would say that the
lowest level of thinking is that
somebody made the decision
to get a vaccination because they're a
coward that is so dumb
like you know if you were looking at
levels of awareness
that would be like you know your faces
in the
water on the bottom of the street kind
of awareness but
everybody's welcome here so hang around
all right uh here are some reasons given
by another twitter user who weighed in
on this
and said a reason why people might not
be getting vaccinated
he said yeah that talking about the
credibility of the people recommending
it he goes that and
vaccines are still in the third stage of
trials i don't know if that's
true is that true but i'm just reading
the tweet now
cannot sue pharmaceutical companies
directly if adverse reactions
myocardis blood clots thrombosis
guillain-barre syndrome and yes
the vares received 627 reports of death
to the vaccines
all right so so this is good
this is somebody who said here are a
bunch of risks
that should be considered when you get
the vaccination is that good thinking
so far is that good thinking
al green says your arrogance is
disgusting
it's called show business l if if i
didn't
have a opinionated take on this you
wouldn't be watching it
let me understand let me explain how
this works it's the
irritation that makes you come back if
if i didn't
show this level of annoying certainty
you wouldn't be addicted to it maybe not
you personally
but it's the it's the uh
the spice and the food that makes you
eat it even though the spice is really
an allergy that
just makes it hurt in your mouth right
so don't throw away the the feature
you think the flaw is the flaw but it's
the feature and i do it intentionally
because i could easily present myself in
a different fashion
and then you wouldn't watch so just
learn what the show is
and then learn what the facts are and
know that they're different right
sometimes the show is the show and you
just have to know what the show is and
then it won't bother you as much
all right so how do you compare a bunch
of risks
so uh on hoodwinked is the user that
said the there that you know the the
third stage of trials and you can't see
them
and there have been bad reports let's
say that's all
true i don't know if it's all true but
let's say it is
how could you compare those risks which
are enumerated
with the risks of getting the cove in
and long haul and
dying on a ventilator you can't
these are all unknown risks you couldn't
put a number on them for
the average person and you certainly
couldn't put a number on it
for yourself
somebody says that six twelve thousand
dead is less than six hundred thousand
dead
well but again that's not a apples and
oranges comparison i see what you're
saying
um
so somebody on local says scott did his
own research
took a vaccine and won't stop talking
about how he's not an advocate for it
um but you would don't you understand
that
a person's personal risk is a separate
topic from advocacy
you get that right like if one person
decides to get an abortion or not get
one how does that affect you
like how does my decision about my
health
become persuasion for you
because i will tell you directly you
shouldn't follow my example
i mean you can but you shouldn't
because why would i assume that my
experience or my risk
profile is like yours probably one of
the biggest
factors is what it does in your head
right
like whatever is happening in your head
about what fear
what fear you have what freedom you want
uh whether you want to be helpful to
other people
potentially or not all of those things
are
are big variables like what your head
is doing because this isn't just
physical right
you're not managing just your physical
health you're you're
managing your mental health so
how could i make a recommendation that
you should or should not get vaccinated
when one
of the biggest variables is a thing
that's only in your head i can't see it
if what your head if your head makes you
deathly afraid of one of the options
and not afraid of the other for
irrational reasons
you know what i would tell you do the
thing that makes you less afraid
if if you have that fear now in my case
i didn't have a special fear of the
vaccination
um or a special fear of the covet really
because the odds of you know me
specifically dying from it are pretty
hard
pretty low but the reason that i don't
recommend it is because that would be
irrational
and i have a real ethical and moral
problem about that so i can only tell
you what i did
and i can tell you if it worked or not
right
so i got the vaccination and in my
opinion
it worked in quotes now worked
means that it made me feel better so
if not getting the vaccination makes you
feel better
you might have a different decision than
me and i don't care
i'd be fine with that please make your
own decision as long as people can get
vaccinated
who want vaccinations can do it go ahead
all right so when alex berenson was
mentioned as
someone who gets it all right and i'm
mentioned as somebody who got it all
wrong i wondered to myself i wonder if
anybody's done a
detailed analysis of alex berenson to
see
you know if he's more right than wrong
have you ever done that have you ever
googled
alex berenson and criticism
to see if there's somebody who's looked
at all of his claims and just
sort of evaluated them to see how
accurate they are
is there anybody who just follows alex
berenson but has never done that
has never googled to find out if the
critics are saying he's wrong
because if you haven't done that maybe
you oughta
maybe you ought to all right here's what
happened when i did that
one article that came up was from the
atlantic
uh or actually no the first one that i
looked at was from vanity fair
and it was an article in vanity fair
saying that alex berenson was
you know basically a critic of
vaccines and masks and whatnot and that
he gets everything wrong
and then i looked for the reasons i
didn't have any
what the it's an article about how
he got everything wrong
without mentioning what he got wrong so
this is making me think
um is he getting a lot of stuff right
right and i see you laughing at vanity
fair in the
in the comments because they're not
really a credible publication
but then i looked for another uh
non-credible publication because it
didn't look like any credible ones were
writing about it
called the atlantic would you consider
the atlantic
a credible publication no
no i don't think you could consider them
credible at all
so staff writer derek thompson
went through a bunch of claims that alex
berenson had made
now i'll tell you in advance that derek
says you know here's the claim and how
he got it wrong
now what if i told you a billion times
if you hear
one person making a bunch of claims what
have you learned
nothing nothing if you hear one person
making a bunch of claims
no matter what the claims are you've
learned nothing
because you haven't heard the other side
and we don't live in a world where
people tell you the truth
they give you a biased you know
hyperbolic version of something and if
you haven't heard the other side you
haven't heard anything
it's like exactly like hearing nothing
so if you've only heard
alex berenson's stuff you've heard
nothing because you haven't heard the
other side
likewise when i tell you what the
criticisms are against
alex berenson you're going to hear one
view of the criticism
and you should give it exactly zero
credibility i'm going to read it anyway
just so you see both sides
but don't take sides because neither the
atlantic
nor alex berenson by himself
is credible we don't live in a world
where you can say either one of them is
just automatically right
but i'll tell you what the what the uh
criticism is all right uh according to
derek here on tucker carlson berenson
predicted that the
vaccines would cause an uptick in cases
of covet related illness
in the us and i guess the claim is that
didn't happen
so first of all i don't know if that's
an accurate statement of what berenson
claimed
and neither do you probably and
um i guess he berenson also claimed that
we would not reach a half a million
deaths and we were well over six hundred
thousand
but is that a big problem if somebody
said we won't reach half a million
but the real number might be six or
seven hundred thousand that's not a big
deal
like nobody was accurate about the death
count right i wasn't
i don't think anybody was so i'd say
okay that's a fair statement but
that's not really much of a criticism um
and then they say that berenson has
argued that cloth and surgical mass
can't protect against the coronavirus
and that he links to
uh science that says the mass do work
now what did i just tell you before if
you believe masks don't work and you
google it
you'll find all kinds of proof that
you're right if you believe they do work
and you google it you'll find all kinds
of sciences as they do
try it yourself i mean if you don't
believe that just try it
so we have two views of this
um we'll leave that there all right um
apparently berenson according to derek
claimed
that he blamed the vaccines for
suppressing our immune systems by
and that he did that because he
misrepresented some
immune system behavior in other words it
was just a misinterpretation of how
immune systems work
who's right berenson or a guy who wrote
an article in the atlantic
which one of them is right on this
scientific question
well aren't they both right because you
could just google
and do your own research so since they
both googled and they both did their own
research
they must both be right right no they
have opposite opinions
i don't know berenson suggested that
countries such as israel have suffered
from the early vaccine rollout
um and derek suggests that
uh that that the deaths have plummeted
and the vaccines are successful
israel is having some problems now i'm
not sure we have full
visibility on that but that may have
changed since this article
um and uh berenson implied that
for non-seniors the side effects of the
vaccine
are worse than the covent itself and
derek points out that according to the
cdc the pandemic has killed
tens of thousands of people under 50 and
the vaccines have
not conclusively killed anybody
conclusively
they haven't conclusively killed anybody
well you're dead but not conclusively
because of the
vaccine now i i feel that this is a
responsible statement
because it is inconclusive i mean i
don't even know how you would know
exactly
but i do think that you can conclusively
say that vaccines in general do kill
people
you know almost every new medication of
any consequence
kills somebody so it's probably true we
just don't know how much
so um embarrassing claim in country
after country cases rise
after vaccination do you think that's
true
did he first of all did he claim that i
don't even know if he claimed that
and i guess on twitter the author talked
to berenson embarrassing claim that a
denmark study
an excellent denmark study shows there's
a 40 rise in infections
immediately after nursing home residents
got their first shots
and so the the writer of the article
reached out to the author of that study
the reference study and asked and uh
the author of the study said that
berenson had mischaracterized her
findings
okay
and another claim that the
vaccines are their own data proves that
they don't work
and according to the author the reality
is that
he just mischaracterized the trial data
so
so the claim is that berenson who
graduated from yale
is a published author of great success
and wrote for the new york times for
years so we're talking about a very
smart educated person
the claim is that he's not educated
enough to look at the
to do his own research basically because
he did his own research and he did it
wrong
according to the claim all right uh
berenson's claim in israel the shots are
causing a scary number of deaths and
hospitalizations
the reality according to the author is
that none of that's happening um
so what so what do you think do you
agree with the
yale educated ex-new york times reporter
who unambiguously is very smart we'd all
agree with that right
there's no there's nothing wrong with
alex berenson's iq
he's a really smart educated
well-informed guy
do you think he's capable with all of
those qualifications of
doing his own research i would say
obviously no
obviously no because the people who did
the research
say you misinterpreted our research
i mean that's pretty clear all right
here's the scariest
story that i'm gonna say is probably
fake news right so before i tell you
this story and you get all worried about
it
maybe you shouldn't worry about it but
i'm gonna tell you it
smells like fake news like really hard
so keep an open mind on this one but
anyway
there was a study that showed that if
you've got coven 19
especially if you got the bad version of
it where you get on the ventilator
and then survive i don't know how many
people that is
but your iq could drop
seven points on average
holy you know you've heard about
the brain fog
and you have the long coved and it can
maybe
make your brain and swell or something i
don't know what the hell is doing to
your organs
but scientists tested 81 000 people
between january and december last year
this is in great britain
and then they gave them iq tests and
there were people who recovered and gave
them iq tests
and um there was a big difference
it was a big difference uh i just store
somebody says i just saw that story i
call bs all right
why would it be bbs number one
how many studies that are peer-reviewed
end up being and just in
general
about half about half of all studies
end up being wrong so you've got a 50
chance is wrong before you've even
looked at the topic
right okay do you agree with that that
there's a 50
chance it's wrong before you've even
looked at it
but then let's look at it do you believe
that they got the causation
right do you believe that it was the
the virus that made these people who got
extra sick
it was the virus that made them dumber
or was it that dumb people are more
likely to have a bad outcome with the
virus
what do you think now they did control
for factors including age sex
first language and education level
okay but within within a given education
level
there are people who are much smarter
and dumber right
so even if you've controlled for the
education level
there's still a pretty big range at
least a seven point
iq range within any educational level
i think you'd agree with that so
i have a speculation that
people who are smarter are better at
everything
would you agree with that that on
average just on average
that people who are smarter are better
at everything
all other things being equal would would
you agree with the basic
basic assumption people are smarter in
general or better at everything
in general not every person in every
situation i just mean on average
right now if that's true would it be a
stretch
to say that the smarter people are going
to have better outcomes with coronavirus
yes i mean it's not a stretch do you
think that the smarter people were more
likely to take vitamin d
maybe right do you think the smarter
people
got a little extra exercise and got some
sun
during the pandemic maybe do you think
the smarter people stayed out of the
room
that had a whole bunch of people in it
without masks for a long time
maybe right you can you can imagine
a whole bunch of decisions that all of
us are making every day in the pandemic
you know do i go to that place without
my mask do i
you know put on a new mask do i get the
vaccine you know all kinds of stuff
right and you could imagine very easily
that being smart
improves your odds of just everything
so i would call on the study
just because most studies are
and then secondly because i don't know
if they got the causation right
but just a big question now that would
be another example let's say you did
your own research
you did your own research and then you
saw this study
what do you do with it because you did
your own research
right anomaly legendary energy and you
saw this what did you do with it with
your own research
did you say that i'll incorporate this
into my thinking or not incorporate it
which one's right right not so easy to
do your own research
all right um there's an update on the
big lie
you know cnn and the left-leaning
anti-trump
media came up with this great brand the
big lie
to refer to trump saying that the
election was stolen
trump of course flipped it around as
you knew he was going to do and he says
the big lie is that the election was
fair
and this caused stephen cullinson the
designated cnn
anti-trump troll to have to write
another article
another article today in which he
mentions the fact
that trump is trying to flip it around
and turn the big lie into something else
to which i say the more you talk about
it
the more you talk about it the better it
works
so apparently trump has at least scared
cnn enough
that he can pull this off the flipperoo
of turning the big lie into
you know the opposite of what they're
using it for
just like he did with fake news and they
should be worried
because he does have the skill to do
this he has
still has enough of an audience that he
could he could totally make this
transition
and i wouldn't be surprised if it
happens
all right that is what i wanted to talk
about today
and i know you've got all problems with
you know mask talk etc i get that
but i'm actually surprised at how often
there's a new angle on it
because when i when i talk about knacks
and
masks and vaccines i'm really talking
about the human decision-making process
i'm not really talking about whether the
vaccine works i don't know
how the hell would i know i'm not
talking about whether bass
you know definitely work or not i will
find out
someday maybe maybe not i don't know i
mean it seems like they work to me
but i could be wrong and i would
further say that if you talk to anybody
who shows
positivity about vaccines or mass or
coronavirus
any amount of certainty is a guaranteed
tell
for somebody who's not thinking if
you're
thinking about this pandemic at all
you're
you're thinking probability because
we've all been wrong
right haven't we all been wrong about
really basic stuff
so uh oh i hear locals is working
very well today uh even
anatoly somebody somebody's mentioning
one of my
uh favorite twitter follows so
anatoly is just great at ripping apart
data and
and studies uh but yeah i would say that
no matter how good you are
you're you're just you're kidding
yourself if you can do your own research
on stuff like this
all right
amazon has no cheaper cheap rapid tests
for covint
why good question
why does amazon not yet have a whole
bunch of
cheap maybe not as accurate but cheap
tests because if they're cheap enough
they work anyway
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you on
youtube tomorrow
