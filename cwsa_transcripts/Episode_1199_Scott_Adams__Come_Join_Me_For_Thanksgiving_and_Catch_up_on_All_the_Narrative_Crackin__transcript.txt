hey everybody
come on in here happy thanksgiving
what a great day and
to make this the best day of all
what could it be oh yeah you know all
you need is a couple of margarita glass
attacker chelsea's eye and a canteen jug
or a flask
vessel of any kind you fill that thing
with
a beverage of your choice and then you
can join me
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thanksgiving
blessing you've been waiting for it's
called the simultaneous sip
and watch it happen right now go
that is good stuff good stuff well are
you prepared
for your uh thanksgiving feast today
i am you want to see it you want to see
my thanksgiving feast
i got it right here
yeah delicious
now i'm what you call a an
unorganized person i'm not really good
at planning in my social life in my
business career i plan 40 years in
advance
actually literally i plan 40 years in
advance
for business but for my personal life
i plan about 10 minutes in advance
so i went to the grocery store yesterday
saying to myself
looks like i'm going to be socially
distancing on thanksgiving
i better make sure i have some food in
the house
so i drove down to my local supermarket
put my mask on got out of the car
walked over to my grocery store and saw
the line
going out the door and down the block
and i said to myself i think i'm going
to eat
whatever is already at my house
because i didn't want to get in that
line and
get the coved while i'm getting my my
food
so it turns out this is the only food i
have in the house
so this will be my feast tonight oh you
think this is sad
it's not this is delicious i put it in
the convection oven for eight minutes
slice it out like a like a surgeon
put a little soy sauce and pepper don't
forget the pepper
and this is a delicious meal you don't
even have to peel it just
cut it and then eat his little guts out
when it's done
you want to talk about politics it's a
holiday
so we don't have to but i feel like
there's just so much
going on that we sort of want to
right so let's dig in so i believe that
both iran and china have congratulated
joe biden now
does that scare you we'll get to the
krakens and the
pennsylvania hearing and all that stuff
but here's here's an out of the box
thought could it be that joe biden
is actually the perfect president
for right now it's possible
and here's the argument i've argued many
times in the past
that there's no such thing as a good
president or a bad
president the only thing you have is a
president who either
fits the challenges as they surprisingly
pop up
or doesn't because one personality could
be great for a peace time one could be
great
for a war one could be great for a
pandemic
one could be great for the economy but
you don't really get all of that in one
person
so your best case scenario is that the
person and the problems match up
coincidentally
at the same time trump was perfect to
goose the economy when it was already
recovering
perfect i thought obama was actually a
good
choice for an economy that was teetering
on the edge and just needed some
confidence
he did make you feel confident most
people anyway not all of you
so here is my thought
could iran make any kind of a deal
with a president trump think about it
was that even a possibility was there
any way
that iran after being you know
 slapped for years by trump
could iran be bitch-slapped for years
and then just say you know
hey i got an idea how about we negotiate
a piece
it's not really possible is it
but imagine biden taking over and we
still don't know that that's going to
happen we'll talk about that a little
bit
but imagine if he did uh if everybody if
the
if the consensus majority is right and
he takes over
could iran do a deal with biden
now is biden likely to immediately
remove all the sanctions
maybe maybe but i feel as if just sort
of keeping them on there a little while
would be easy for biden because
doing nothing is easier than doing
something it would be hard to
it would be hard for biden to add
sanctions
but maybe if he goes into office and
they're already on
he can ride it a little while and maybe
maybe iran will say this is our out
maybe they'll say this whole war thing
wasn't working
the supporting terrorism wasn't working
and we just need a an exit ramp could
trump
ever be that exit ramp now he was the
perfect exit ramp
for kim jong-un wouldn't you say
i think trump is actually the perfect
exit ramp for that
i think trump is the perfect exit ramp
for saudi arabia to improve relations
with israel
because the president you know he backed
saudi arabia even when it was hard
right so trump backed saudi arabia
when that was really hard to do they owe
him a favor
they owe him a favor period they owe him
a favor
and so he would be maybe perfect for
that
but it looks like that might happen so
could it be
i'm just trying to trying to find the
positivity here
you don't mind do you we'll be a little
bit positive today
because it's thanksgiving why not so one
possibility is
that president trump will have started
all of the necessary elements toward
peace but it could
be it could be you need a finisher
could biden be the finisher
it's possible it's not impossible
and if any of you are saying scott
don't be such a naive gullible fool as
long as the
as long as the leadership of iran is in
place
they will only lie to you they will
never make peace
maybe could be but they're also in a
nearly impossible situation so that can
make you flexible
who knows so i'm not going to predict
that will happen but i'll just put it
out there as
maybe anything's possible
um biden sent down to thanksgiving tweet
reminding us that we are not enemies
with each other
we americans but we are all enemies with
the virus
sounds good but you called half the
country a racist
basically because the way you handled
the whole
fine people thing i'm not over that
and i'm not going to get over that i'm
certainly willing to work with whatever
administration is in office you know i'm
certainly willing to be a
you know friendly to everybody that i
meet in person
but no i'm not really over that and
i've got a feeling i'm not ever going to
be over that
because there are some lines which when
crossed
you can't you can't go back that was a
one-way trip
the whole find people hoax thing that
was a one-way
trip you don't get to come back from
that so you can be president
perhaps you can even get my support
but joe biden i hate your guts
for that and that's not going to change
um
here's uh here's another best case
scenario are you ready
uh imagine the things that could have
happened that didn't
one thing that could have happened was
that trump won the election
narrowly riots right
riots you know four more years of
antifa black lives matter ruling the
streets it could have been bad
it could have been bad maybe not you
know maybe it had died down but
i'm not sure that would have been the
best path for the
coherence of the country and really
there's a mental health question
i think the country is suffering from
mental health problems
like literally not joking not making a
political point
like in an actual mental health way
the the covet stuff is really kicking
our kicking our brain's ass
and then you add on top of that any
division that comes out of politics
and your brain is getting quite a
workout here in terms of mental health
so would a second term of trump if it
had sparked
even greater violence and unrest
been the best thing for the country
maybe
but let's just walk through the other
options okay
the other options were that
biden wins clean and by clean i mean
in such a way that even the people who
thought
there was massive cheating would be
willing to say
ah okay but there's no such thing as
that much cheating
so maybe there was some cheating but he
still won
because he won by 60 million votes
you know hypothetically so i don't think
um i don't think that was possible
and we didn't get that right so it
wasn't possible for
biden to win so cleanly that nobody
doubted the
the process and if trump had won
narrowly
or even by a lot i think that would have
been riots
so what would have been if you could
have drawn this out on paper
what would have been the best outcome
i'm going to propose that we might be
experiencing it
it just doesn't feel like it right if i
said to you
hey hey guys are you having the best
case
scenario right now you would look at me
like i'm crazy
it's like are you kidding the the
election process is in question
you know the the process has been a mess
how is this the best case scenario
well let me make my case it goes like
this
did we avoid the riots in the street
so far so far would you say that your
assumption about you know what kind of
unrest
there would be immediately after the
election were you not wrong
everybody who said there would be
massive unrest after the election
i think you'd have to say they were
wrong that didn't happen
so that's good so so far
anything that gets us to not rioting in
the streets
that's better than it was right
so let's bank that thought but let's
continue
suppose what comes out of this
is a national understanding that our
election system is not
is not secure now whether or not
there was massive cheating that changed
the outcome
separately but connected to that
question is
are our elections secure because you
always have to worry about the future as
well right
suppose the only thing that came out of
this
was that we learned how to fix our
elections and make them secure in the
future
that would be amazing that would be a
really really
really good outcome you could even argue
it would be the first
time that the united states had a true
democracy
democracy republic you know what i'm
talking about
don't be pedantic all right we could be
heading toward the second american
revolution
it just happens with software and with
our election process
we might be learning that for the first
time
ever we might have the opportunity
to let the people pick our politicians
i don't know if that's good but it but
you do fight revolutions
to get that so people obviously want it
so if that was the only outcome we moved
to let's say
a maybe a blockchain system
i would guess that in four years we'll
probably have a parallel system
here's well here's the way i would do it
i would build a blockchain based app
and i would run one election with
parallel systems
and i would say for some of you who
volunteer
do us a favor vote on the app and then
separately vote
you know the normal way with a ballot or
going in person
and we won't count the app votes
the first time we do it we're just going
to run parallel systems
and see see if you know we learn
anything see if anything breaks
then if it works you fix whatever
problems and maybe put it into
put it into action but i would run them
parallel and just do it as an experiment
if that's all we got out of this
it would be amazing amazing
it would might even signal the coming of
the golden age
now suppose that president trump
decides to go george washington on this
let's say he pursues the court cases and
rudy
makes his case now he might not win in
court
in the sense that the election is
reversed and trump is put in office i
don't think that's going to happen
because i don't just don't think the
courts will look at the facts
i think they'll look at the big picture
you know what's
what's going to keep civilization
together and so i think that they
might go for whatever gives you the most
stable situation
as opposed to technically what the law
would indicate
so that's what i think now suppose the
president says
i'm gonna take i'm gonna take my
opportunity
i'm going to go george washington and
i'm going to say you know
according to this process and according
to the voters i have convinced you
you the voters you are convinced that
the election was stolen
i could fight and get power back but i'm
going to go george washington
and i'm going to say let's let's
keep the system intact
it would look kind of a strong play and
then he starts maybe
another career as a media news
mogul it's a big success it's a lot of
fun
could be good suppose the republicans do
hold the senate
which i have a lot of doubts about
because if the election was rigged at
the presidential level
why wouldn't it be rigged at the state
level when they do this
senate runoff thing what what would
possibly stop them
at the local level from rigging it again
if they rigged it the first time so if
you imagine
it's true that they rigged it the first
time at a national level
which means bringing it at the necessary
state levels
why wouldn't they do it again what
possible
thing would stop them if it worked
so i don't know that we'll get a
republican senate but let's say we do
that means that maybe biden doesn't
overtax me and maybe we get a little
relief
from the you know the social unrest
maybe trump's voice is just as strong
but it's external to government
could be just as strong um
might not be bad stock market's up
right i feel like we'll survive this
one way or the other all right
i also think that if you're a republican
the current situation
of let's say biden takes office and he
does a reasonably
moderate job without too many uh super
lefty things because the
the congress won't let him get away with
it
what happens in 2022
we're on a path that almost guarantees
republican
control of congress by 2022
and then what happens in 2024
well well biden won't be running so you
don't have an incumbent
and if you don't have an incumbent and
the last election looks like it was
stolen
i like the republicans chances whoever
that is whether it's trump or somebody
else
so don't assume that bad news has
happened let's talk about the
churches i guess the supreme court
backed
some church in new york the the
local government cuomo wanted the
churches to
close i guess i don't know all the
details but uh the supreme court
five to four said you are treating the
churches
unfairly compared to other groups and
businesses and organizations so they
reversed it
now i'm not uh i'm not a believer or
religious
so i've been kind of staying out of this
topic
but i want to just throw this notion
into the mix what would jesus do
let's say jesus was you know came back
and
and he just became the pastor of your
local church
and you know you got lucky so you go to
your local church
and there's actually jesus came back to
life
what would jesus do in the pandemic okay
don't be a wise guy
i know he would just heal his heal his
people
that's too clever yes he would just go
out and he would
touch the people who had coveted and
heal them that's not what i'm talking
about
what would he do in terms of keeping the
church open would he
would he say hey let's just wait
wait it out and we'll be fine or would
he say no
religious the religious
impulse is too important too important
to your souls
and even taking one year off
is unacceptable because you have rights
you know you have a constitutional right
plus
you know god wants you to worship right
but what would jesus do literally
literally jesus what would he do
would jesus say yeah some of you are
gonna die
but it's very important that you worship
in the same building at the same time
does that sound like jesus did that
sound like something jesus would say
yeah some of you will die but it's very
important
that you don't worship alone for this
one year where we have this medical
problem
but rather you should do it in person
i don't feel like he would say that but
again
i'm not religious and it's you know my
opinion on this
is completely irrelevant let me tell you
what i would do if i were the church
who had won this court case i would say
we have won our court case
now we're going to close the church
that's what i'd do
if i were jesus i would fight the
government trying to close my church
because i would say hey i think i think
this is unfair
i might fight the case because of the
unfairness of it the way it's
being implemented but once i won
and it was no longer the government's
choice
whether this church is open or not and
now it's
more of a jesus question right what
would jesus do
i feel like jesus would win the court
case because he's jesus
how does jesus lose a court case i think
he'd be pretty good
defending his side
but i think he might say uh let me give
you a parable
suppose your local church had a termite
problem
and your pastor said we're gonna we're
gonna miss a week of church
because we've gotta attend it and we're
gonna do a
termite eradication thing so you're just
gonna lose one week
can't use the building just one week
because it wouldn't be healthy
would you be okay with that or would you
take it to the supreme court
well i don't i think you'd be okay with
it so it's really sort of a timing thing
right
the reason you'd be okay with the
termite tent
is that it's not permanent
things that aren't permanent aren't
really
problems that's sort of my philosophy
there's two parts of the philosophy if
you can solve it with money i've taken
this from my
friend jason if you can solve a problem
with money
it's not that big a problem because
there's usually a way to find
money you know there are ways to make
money
somebody says come on man
somebody says jesus defeated death
you're wrong scott
i don't know what that means souls are
more important than virus
would your soul be damaged
if your church is tented for termites
would your soul be damaged or would you
just say i think i'll pray at home today
and
hit the church next week when it's safe
i don't know so again nothing about my
opinion on this should be important
uh i'm not part of the question but
uh there you go let's talk about the
flynn pardon everybody saw that coming i
think you all expected that right
you all expected flynn to get pardoned i
i did
and here's the funny part i was uh
i was listening to msnbc and flipping
back and forth to
fox and it is really shocking i don't
know how many times
you know you've had the experience
yourself so it's this is not a new
thought
but listening to msnbc talk about the
same news you're watching
on another network is is a really freaky
experiment
experience according to them
a case in which the prosecutor himself
wants to drop the charges
there they think they act like they're
watching a murder
that this uh this pardon was so over the
line
that the president has now destroyed all
our norms and
and what did i tell you that the
prosecutor himself doesn't want to
prosecute the case
because there's not enough of a case
there the prosecutor wants to drop the
the charges if the prosecutor
wants to drop the charges
that's not really watching a murder
happen
that's more like nothing happening here
right
so it's really freaky watching the msnbc
people think that they're
it's just the worst problem in the world
um
so what about snowden
so snowden's name came up i think the
president said he
doesn't know a whole bunch about the
case and but he'll be looking into it so
he was neither a yes nor no on that i
feel as though every time the president
noodles about a pardon it ends up
happening
is there any exception to that have we
seen yet
any case where the president has talked
in public
like well you know i'm thinking about
that or i'm looking into it
where it didn't happen because i feel as
if he wouldn't say that
unless he knew he was going to do it
right i mean he could always change his
mind
but i've got a feeling his preliminary
thinking
and here i'm doing a little mind reading
so don't take this too seriously
i feel as if he doesn't bring it up
unless he is favorably disposed already
if i feel that way now of course he was
responding to a question
but if he were not favorably disposed i
feel he would have said
well that's a tough one you know i
that's that was a very serious crime you
know i
i think that would be a tough pardon i
think if he said that
then i'd expect maybe it wouldn't happen
but if he just says well i haven't
looked into it
that feels like he's already decided but
we'll see
apparently barr is violently opposed to
it and a lot of
well-meaning patriotic people are also
opposed to it
i i'm not uh also real steeped in the
details i understand that the accusation
is that he hurt our national security
and may have even gotten people
killed that's that's the that's the
allegation right
but here's my take on this so i just
watched an interview with him a fresh
interview in which
noted was saying that his only condition
for returning to the u.s
and i guess this has been consistent
from the start
is that he wants a guarantee that he can
tell his story at trial
did you know that's all he's asking for
the snowden would come back
and go to trial he's not saying
i need a pardon to return he's not even
asking for that
apparently not once he's asked for
a fair trial in which he gets to tell
his story
and apparently that's not guaranteed
now i don't know what it means to
guarantee it i suppose you could put
that in writing
i don't know what kind of guarantees the
justice department can make
that are legal but isn't that not
asking for much so here's my take on it
if it's true that the u.s will not
guarantee him
a fair trial meaning he's not even
asking for a fair trial
he's only asking to be able to tell his
story
if we can't guarantee that
he has to be pardoned he has to be
because let me put it into a visual
argument let's say you are very opposed
to the snowden pardon and let's say you
took all of your concerns
and you translated them into a physical
weight
and let's say it weighed a ton that's a
lot
all right that's how much you don't want
snowden to be pardoned
one ton now let's do the same
measurement
on this question of how do you deal with
somebody who can't get a fair trial
well if i were to take the fact that
this person
a whistleblower can't get a guarantee
even to tell his story in public at a
trial
what weight would you put on that
compared to the
ton of weight you put on snowden
did something bad in your opinion and
shouldn't it should not be pardoned
that's a ton what weight would you put
on
protecting the the core system
in the united states that most minimal
guarantee
that you can get a free trial well if
if don't pardon him weighs a ton my
personal subjective thing is that the
other thing weighs a hundred tons
because whatever happens to one
individual
pales in comparison to the integrity of
the system
and if we can't guarantee an american
citizen
a whistleblower specifically a fair
trial
and not even a fair trial he's not even
asking for a fair trial
he's asking just to tell his story and
we can't give him that
that's a hundred tons and it's not even
close
to a decision about whether he should or
should not be pardoned
under this situation
yeah he should be pardoned 100 and i
don't care what he did
tell me he killed somebody okay still
should be pardoned
tell me he hurt american security okay
still should be pardoned tell me that
everybody in the world and in the
the legal system hates him and thinks he
should die i don't care
this reason is way bigger than all of
those reasons
they're not even close all right
um there's a question of whether the
president could pardon himself or
let's say cleverly with stepping down
and having pence pardon him
and the question is can you pardon
somebody before there's a crime
there's a you know a trial and a crime
is it possible
and legal to pardon somebody generically
well uh emily compeno said on the five
that it's not that's not a thing
you you have to have a crime and then
you can pardon it
but if you have a well there might have
been a crime we might find one later
you can't pardon it because there's
nothing to pardon
thank you you're getting ahead of me in
the comments but
is that true wasn't true for nixon
nixon did get a generic pardon
now there is a question whether that
would have
withstood a supreme court challenge
but it wasn't challenged and so it stood
now if trump also got a generic
pardon and apparently generic still has
to have
boundaries so in the case of nixon there
was a
time limited pardon meaning that he
couldn't murder somebody tomorrow
and get away with it he's only pardoned
for a limited period of time
maybe the presidency i think
and they could do the same thing with
trump say well this is the period of
time we're talking about maybe including
before the presidency if you want to go
that way
and say you could be generically
pardoned without any specific
crimes it's just your pardon in advance
so i think it's possible but in the case
of trump it might go to the supreme
court
but he's got the supreme court kind of
leaning his way at the moment
so i'm gonna say that it is possible
but not guaranteed meaning the pardon
could work
but it could get overturned all right
let's talk about sydney powell
who has filed two big lawsuits
late last night and people are pouring
over the many many pages of it
the lawsuit but one of the things that
stands out is in one of the titles
there are some really obvious
misspellings
and people are saying uh what's going on
here
because that's the one thing you don't
expect your high-end lawyers to do wrong
misspell things in the title like i
think there were two words
with look like typos not misspellings
and
so a lot of people are saying uh what's
going on now
if i had to guess they were in a hurry
something got i don't know maybe there
was some ocr thing
has been suggested might have been an
ocr problem where it
and nobody reread it so it could have
been just they ran out of time and
didn't do as complete a job as they
would normally trying to meet a deadline
so i don't think that's important in any
way
but everybody's talking about it
i don't have an opinion about how strong
that evidence is
but let's talk about rudy's uh and jenna
ellis
and etc were at the pennsylvania hearing
yesterday
how many of you watched any part of that
hearing
it was hard to find the networks were
not covering it
then it was long but here's my take on
it
the the basic setup is that republicans
in pennsylvania held a hearing
rudy giuliani and other attorneys gave
their evidence of
what they have seen but
here is the brilliant part about it so i
give
rudy an a plus and and his
his team i give them an a plus for that
hearing
here's why it wasn't a court of law
and therefore obviously nothing binding
is going to happen there
but if you're watching it on television
it looks pretty official doesn't it
now it was the opposite of any kind of a
uh let's say a process you could trust
because it was all just republicans
showing one side of the story
there were there were nobody on the
other side no democrats were arguing the
points no
lawyers were challenging it was just
republicans
talking to republicans and making their
case but
if you turned it on and you're just a
low information
voter and you happen to see it it kind
of looked pretty official looking
and all you heard was all this evidence
from rudy
of allegations of fraud lots of them
apparently there were hundreds of
affidavits
lots of the observations and the
affidavits are backed up by multiple
witnesses
so it's not even like one person saw a
ufo it's like
one person says they saw a ufo and there
are 75 people who say the same thing
right so that just changes your your
perceived credibility because you got
lots of witnesses it's not just one
person
so uh in terms of the pr
battle which is a big part of this you
have to convince the public
before you could have any chance of
getting legislators
to do something outside of the normal
process
meaning to decertify or to overturn the
result or to have the house
pick the president so if you imagine
that
uh what rudy was doing is it was
providing
court-like proof well that didn't happen
he did not present anything that if you
were in court
you would say oh yeah i saw a proof
because he showed it to us
no that didn't happen we're still into
allegations and evidence and
affidavits you know we're moving toward
toward that but we're not there and i
thought the whole thing was
brilliantly planned and executed because
it was like a mock
trial with only one point of view
presented
which is as good as you can get in
engineering a political theater now the
people who
criticized and said ah that was just
political theater
it was it was political theater by
design
and it was really really good so calling
something political theater
isn't really an insult if what you
designed
was political theater and you designed
your political theater
to change public opinion and and you
know in a related way change political
uh you know people who have been elected
change their opinions too
it really worked i'm going to tell you
that you could not have watched that as
an
objective citizen and walked away from
that
thinking there was no massive fraud you
if you saw that
it wasn't proof and and what i saw at
least in
there wouldn't hold up in court but man
it was persuasive
it was really persuasive now will that
translate to court
unknown we will find out
here was one of rudy's best arguments
that really really threw me
because i didn't see this one coming and
maybe maybe you did you're smarter than
me
and it goes like this we know that the
courts don't like to disenfranchise
voters
so one of the claims is that there were
i know 600 700
000 votes that were counted without
witnesses being allowed
to monitor it now normally
let's say you took that to the court and
said there were hundreds of thousands of
votes which were not monitored
but we don't have proof that they're
fake
it just wasn't monitored in the way we
wish it had been monitored
that's all we know for sure with the
court
then throw out those votes no
probably not because the court would say
yeah technically you made your case
you know they're supposed to be watched
they were not watched
technically that's a violation but
it's better to keep the system stable
it's better not to disenfranchise those
people
who thought they were voting what about
all the people who voted
don't they have rights to have their
vote counted how do you throw away a
citizen's vote
so you can imagine that the court would
just say yeah you made your case
and we're still going to rule against
you because it's just better for the
world
and then rudy adds this little part
which is really good if you don't punish
them
they'll do it again and i thought to
myself
that's a pretty good argument because uh
if
if your concern as the court is the
well-being of you know the whole
so you're not going to obsess about the
technical infraction
if you want to keep the whole healthy
doesn't it keep the whole healthiest
if you punish anybody who tries to cheat
in a way that could be corrupted we
don't know that
the non-observed votes were corrupt we
just know that
if next time they don't have to worry
about observers
it's going to be corrupt right so rudy
makes the point
that if you don't reverse the actual
outcome of the election
and put trump in office you will have
rewarded
cheaters in a way that guarantees we'll
never have another fair election
that's a really strong argument
i don't know if that argument will win
but don't you feel that's pretty darn
strong
i had not really thought of the
deterrent argument i'd been obsessed
on the well i think the court's going to
go for whatever
keeps the stability even if it means
allowing a little bit of fraud
that's a strong argument all right um
we watched the whole country learning
because of that pennsylvania hearing
that apparently you can bully and chase
away
republican observers with no penalty
that's what we all learned and if we
haven't learned it by watching that
you'll probably learn it pretty soon
so what happens when the entire country
learns that democrats can bully
republicans out of the room
where they count the votes because if
the if the election is not reversed
if it's not actually reversed
you just taught the country to cheat in
the next election guaranteed
no no way around it guaranteed
the next election is garbage if you
don't reverse the result of this one
strong argument it's a strong argument
i didn't see it coming really
so here's how the mainstream narrative
is starting to
crack i'd say it's i'd say the narrative
is
dare i say kraken and you can see it in
the language
and the choice of words let me run you
through this do you remember
immediately after the election the most
common
phrase you would hear is there is no
evidence of fraud
no evidence of fraud and then
lots of affidavits you know
were surfaced and now it went from
there's no evidence of fraud
to there's no proof of fraud
because evidence doesn't turn into proof
until it's presented in court and and
judged to be true
but did that happen
well i don't know that again once you
get to the legal stuff i get a little
bit lost
in that but my understanding is that the
court cases that
have been lost so far
never judged the facts of
of the allegation can somebody fact
check me on that
that the lawsuits so far have been
dismissed for a variety of technical
reasons and standing and
technical stuff but when the democrats
say
that nothing has been proven in court
and indeed also as a separate point
the trump people or trump uh leaning
people have lost i don't know 26 out of
27 cases
your mind connects those right hasn't
been proven in court
and they've lost 26 out of 27 cases
doesn't your mind
automatically say well that that's got
to be the same thing
the reason that they lost all the cases
logically duh is because they couldn't
prove
the facts doesn't your brain do that
automatically
apparently nothing like that happened
apparently they never have looked at the
facts and therefore
there was never ever any opportunity for
them to say they were true or false
so but the the narrative gets to use
language cleverly to make you think that
that's why the case is lost
a lack of proof apparently that's not
the case
so then it became baseless claims
they changed no proof into baseless
is no proof in court the same as
baseless
no those words don't mean the same thing
but the narrative wants you to nudge you
from
no proof when in fact there has been no
process
to decide if proof exists or not
we're too early for that um
that that that turns into baseless which
of course makes you think that
no proof could come which is different
then of course they inject the word
widespread
that they all tried this trick right
there's no widespread fraud
it's not widespread and of course the
claim was never widespread
the claim was always focused in these
key cities
so but now there's so much evidence
from rudy that even if you imagine
that each of the individual pieces of
allegations
even if they don't add up to something
it still looks kind of widespread
doesn't it even if you just say it's in
those swing state cities
rudy has so many examples in different
ways
different techniques that it's kind of
widespread now
i didn't see that coming because i think
of widespread in terms of
geography but if you think of it in
terms of these targeted cities
it's widespread in terms of thoroughly
infiltrating those places that's pretty
widespread
and so that's now changed to
and this is what how twitter put it in
one of their headline bullets
where they summarize a hashtag
that they use this sentence judges have
found
no evidence of fraud judges
have found no evidence of fraud so now
you're back to the trick
of of thinking well they must have
looked at the evidence
and then they found there was no fraud
but apparently that didn't happen
there was no process by which anybody
looked at any evidence
so if you haven't done the process
let me give you an example i'll use my
tenting your house
for termites example tenting doesn't
work
because my house still has termites and
then the the termite
eradicator guy says oh well we haven't
put the tent on your house yet
you understand that there are termites
in your house
until you put the termite tent on and
then you fumigate
and then if we do it right it's only
afterwards
that your house could have no termites
you understand that right that we're now
with termites
then in the future there's the tenting
and then possibly if you do it right
you get to a no termite situation
and then i say nice try
my house is full of termites okay what
are you not understanding
about the fact that the process hasn't
even begun
and i say look my house has probably had
termites for what six months
at least maybe a year are you telling me
that in six months to a year your
company can't put up a tent
and get rid of the termites in my house
and the termite goes
guy goes i don't know what's happening
here you only called me yesterday
how could i have put up a tent
six months ago when i didn't even know
you existed
you called me yesterday and i'll say
nice try but
my house is full of termites you grifter
what's happening the tenting is tomorrow
it hasn't already happened what's
happening
and i say yeah six months and you
couldn't put up a tent
on my house pathetic
all right um so that's happening uh
i would say that rudy destroyed three
narratives
from the other team yesterday now when i
say he destroyed their narratives
what i'm not saying is proved his case
all right so can we be all smart enough
to know
that when i'm saying he destroyed
several narratives
that's not not in any way saying he
proved his case
all he did was subtract a few attacks
against him
that's all that's all but he did it
really well okay
really well here are the three things
that
you might have believed a few weeks ago
but now maybe you don't
number one the claim that there were not
enough
fraud charges that even if they were
fraud and even if it were proven
it could change the outcome of the race
that's now destroyed because rudy has
given us the numbers
and we don't know if the case will go
his way but the numbers
are absolutely unambiguously
allegedly and that's all we're dealing
with is the allegation
big enough so can we stop saying forever
that if rudy prevails in his case
it would not change the election because
clearly it would
he has now made the case that it's big
enough
doesn't mean he wins but it's big enough
okay so can we get rid of that narrative
forever
probably not but we should number two
um a lot of smart people
told me that there's no real opportunity
for anybody to cheat on a scale big
enough
that it could change the election well
if you listen to that three-hour hearing
you heard nothing but opportunity for
cheating
apparently it's not only possible
to cheat in an election but the number
of ways to do it are so many
that you don't have enough time to hear
them all
now did rudy make the case that there
were so many allegations
that at the very least it was possible
meaning that even if each of these
individual allegations
you know we found out nobody used those
loopholes
nobody used those opportunities
he still proved the opportunities were
there for example
he might be able to prove that observers
were kept
out of the room with the ballots
probably very provable with witnesses
etc
if he proves that people were kept out
of that room it doesn't mean there was
fraud inside the room
it just means you know he's proven that
i think i had some other point but
i already forgot it oh the point is that
he would have proven there was
opportunity to cheat
behind that closed door but he would not
have proven that the cheating actually
happened hypothetically
so the argument that there wasn't an
opportunity
i think he slayed there is nothing left
of that argument
and that is why i say this might be one
of the best thing that's ever happened
to the country
because i think rudy will at the very
least
be the agent that causes our election
system to be
improved and hardened if that's all that
comes out of it would be great
number three the thought that if there
was so much
cheating scott scott
scott scott scott if there was that much
cheating
there would be witnesses you know
because you would need probably multiple
people to be in on it
you're going to have lots of witnesses
so
where are all your witnesses scott
well i think that question's been asked
and answered
turns out there are hundreds of them and
there are only hundreds of them
because if you had uh you know another
thousand of them they would be saying
the same observations
in other words there were multiple
witnesses to each alleged
fraud or imperfection and
so now you can never say that again if
you're being honest
you can never say that
if there was that much cheating you'd
have tons of witnesses because
there are tons of witnesses that's now a
fact
i think i mean he says he has these
sworn statements
if he doesn't show them to us i'd be
pretty disappointed
but but we assume that that's probably
not something he's lying about right
that they exist
so that doesn't mean he's proven his
case but i don't want to hear anybody
say
the allegations are not large enough to
change the
result i don't want anybody to say
there's no opportunity to cheat
in our elections there are tons of them
and i don't want to hear anybody say
that there are no witnesses and of
course if there was that much cheating
there'd be witnesses there are tons of
them
all right here's how cnn confused me
about
the pennsylvania situation i'm going to
read their exact statement
and see if you can figure out what the
hell this means all right on wednesday
the commonwealth court of pennsylvania
issued a temporary injunction
prohibiting state officials from taking
further action
in certifying the 2020 election
uh pending uh hearing on mail-in ballots
scheduled friday all right
so that sentence i interpret as
uh the con the courts ordered a
temporary injunction
prohibiting state officials from taking
actions to certify
the election so i think this told me
that it's not certified because the
court
prevented them from taking further
actions to certify
okay so the first part of this says it's
not certified yet
and they're pausing it and then the
second part of the same paragraph
says pennsylvania state officials filed
an appeal blah blah blah
and said that the injunction will not
impact
the uh survey certification process
but wasn't it already certified
so i'm a little bit i'm completely
confused
about the certifying situation so i
don't know if pennsylvania's in play or
not
we'll see so twitter suspended uh
pennsylvania senator and colonel
uh doug mostriano because he was leading
the pennsylvania senate hearings
i don't know what he tweeted but he got
suspended for i don't know 12 hours or
something he's back now
and i would just add this to that story
if twitter
suspends you they owe you a reason don't
you think
don't don't you think they owe you a
reason because you would like to know
it's i mean it's not a law
there's no constitutional right that
twitter will tell you why they're
suspending you but it seems good form
you know they should say oh you you
promoted violence or you
said something that wasn't true too many
times something like that
but on top of that
if an elected official gets suspended
from twitter
twitter's obligation again not legal not
constitutional obligation
but i think an obligation of
i don't know members of society let's
say a a social obligation a
a civilization obligation if a senator
gets suspended
for something he said on twitter twitter
needs to explain that to us
right that's not just between twitter
and that one senator or other elected
official
it's not just between them like we're
we're part of this fight right
like if you suspend somebody i voted for
you're with me
right you owe me an explanation
i didn't see one so this would be my
recommendation to
jack and to twitter is that you know i
don't think
that there are no reasons to suspend
people
and i feel that they're experimenting
their way to
to maybe a better situation so as long
as they're a b testing i'm not going to
be too hard on twitter
they're testing stuff they're seeing
what the response is they're seeing what
works
so so some of that's fine but you need
to explain to the public
if you're banning a somebody we voted
for that that's on us
right that's personal you you
i'm not even a you know i'm not even a
citizen of pennsylvania
right i didn't vote for the senator but
it's still personal
because this is a senator that you know
one of
one of my country's states elected
they elected him to speak for them
and twitter decided that he couldn't why
does twitter decide
that an illegally elected senator at
least in this one limited way can't
speak
for us can't speak for the people all
right
enough on that um the daily wire and
hank berrien did a story about
apparently there was a study
to find out how much biden supporters
know about the news
it went just about the way you think it
would go
turns out that a survey of 1750 biden
supporters in seven swing states
so they're looking at the swing states
that's what mattered
uh found that the news media's
suppression of stories now that parts
is opinion you know i know you agree
with the opinion as do i but that's
opinion
have heard former vice president joe
biden's electoral chances
so they go on to talk about the stories
that
democrats didn't hear i'm not talking
about they disagree with the stories
they didn't hear them complete blackout
all right so listen to this uh
82 percent of biden voters were were
unaware of at least
one of the following issues the terror
reads sexual assault allegations 35
were unaware so think about that 35
percent of the people who voted for
biden
probably thought they didn't want to
support the guy who was an accused
sexual molester so they voted for biden
instead
but 35 percent of them had never heard
that he's an accused
rapist i feel sorry for the democrats
and 8.9 percent said they would have
voted for trump
if they had known about that these
numbers are so big they would you know
completely change the election
if the news had allowed and social media
that allowed people to know about these
stories
uh the hunter biden scandal 45
of voters biden voters were unaware
45
of biden voters had never heard
the hunter biden scandal
that is so bad it's just funny
uh i really feel sorry for these people
and 9.4
said they would have switched their vote
all right uh 25 didn't know kamala
harris is
really really left come on how do you
not know that
now some of it is just people don't
watch the news but these are
probably a lot of them are people who
did watch the news and still didn't know
the news um let's see uh
that how many knew there was a huge jump
in economic
growth so how many people knew that were
coming out of the pandemic at least the
economic part
really strongly 49 percent of democrats
didn't know about that they didn't know
the econ how do you not know about the
economy
i mean how do you not pay attention to
that and 5.6 percent said they would
have changed their vote
if maybe if they knew about that how
about the historic peace agreements with
israel
and their arab neighbors now you can't
miss that right
it's like it's like what probably one of
the biggest stories of the year
is that the the middle east is finding
peace and that
trump is a big part of that with jared
kushner
and how many people in the democrats uh
how many
do you think hadn't heard about that
uh let's see uh let's see
i lost that number
it's a big number all right so they
hadn't heard that uh
oh 43 almost 44
had never heard about any of the middle
east peace deals
44 oh my god
poor democrats how about a number of
democrats who are aware
the president was behind operation warp
speed
and that it's a huge success how many
didn't know that
who voted for biden 36
36 all right
now uh of course some of these people
might not have
necessarily voted for trump but they
might have not voted
you know if you could have gotten six
percent of them to not vote
that would have been a pretty big deal
now here's here's the
the kicker on this because we're
spending all our attention talking about
fraud or no fraud the social media
and the news is getting a pass there's
nothing like
the will of the people or democracy that
happened
so this vote wasn't even close
to a democratic process within within
the context of a republic
what not even close the only thing that
happened
and you can see it really clearly in
this survey
what happened is the public was
brainwashed by social media in the news
and that's it every other part of the
story
is way less important is is the fraud
important well it's important for fixing
the elections in the future perhaps
but even the fraud is smaller
than what the social media and and the
fake news did for the past year
way smaller so because the fraud is the
the fun
glowing object and it's the thing we're
watching and we're sort of bored about
talking about media bias
they got a total pass the
for all practical purposes this was the
year
we formed a chinese form of government
you know the chinese form of government
is you've got your supreme leader
your president xi but really he has to
be backed
by the communist party top officials
if president xi lost the support
hypothetically
of all the top officials in the
communist party
he probably would lose power so the
president even though he's sort of
dictator-like he's not really because he
kind of has to have that lower level
agreeing with them similar to iran iran
has a process where there's the supreme
leader
but
he's a supreme leader but he needs his
your religious counsel
to support him or he probably couldn't
stay in power what we have just created
accidentally
is a process by which the social media
ceos given that they control what
happens in their
companies that they've become
effectively like the communist party
of china now this is an analogy
all right so don't get too hung up and
hey they're not exact
there's a slight difference they're not
exact
right i'm just making the point that our
government is now
clearly i mean this survey shows it as
clearly as possible
that the decision of who is president
has been taken out of the hands of the
public
that statement is very strong let me say
it again these social media companies
and
the heads of the big networks have taken
out of the hands of the public
the decision of who their government
will be
that happened there's no story that's
bigger than that
do you know why that's not a story
because we're a communist country now
and
and the communist party you know and
again i'm
taking the analogy too far but the the
heads of the
social media platforms and the heads of
the
news networks they get to decide who's
president
if you don't think that's true well i
got a survey to show you
because it was just shown pretty
conclusively if the news can simply
disappear stories and you can see that
very clearly they did
they get to decide who's president it's
not you it's not you at all
you're not even a little bit involved in
picking the president
not even you you are simply being
assigned an opinion
and then like a good little hypnotized
zombie
you go i have my opinion i'm using my
good judgment
my free will i will go vote now
according to my
smart thinking and free will and none of
that happened
the the public is assigned their
opinions
and then that's it that's the process
you wait for the
oligarchs to tell you what your opinion
will be
they assign it it doesn't affect
everybody
granted maybe you you are invulnerable
maybe their brainwashing doesn't work on
you
but it works enough on enough people
that your vote is irrelevant it doesn't
matter if it works on you
so people still believe that they look
at
the information and form relevant
opinions
that is one of the big reality bending
things that you're going to learn that
you don't
look at data and form opinions
it doesn't happen it is purely an
illusion
you look at the data that the oligarchs
show you
and you don't see anything else and then
you form the opinion
that they wanted you to form which they
created by deciding what information you
see
you are not part of the decision-making
process
even for your own brain that has now
gone
right again there are exceptions right
they don't they don't necessarily
brainwash every person the same way
and just as effectively but that's
what's happening that's the world you
live in now
um there's another study that showed
that the tone of the covid
related news articles in the united
states 91 of them
were negative now you say to yourself uh
doesn't that make sense it's a pandemic
shouldn't 91 of the coverage if not 100
be leaning a little negative we're sort
of in the middle of a pandemic
except that if you look at how media
outside the united states
treats it 54 percent uh given a negative
coverage
so i suppose you could argue that maybe
we got hit worse in the united states
maybe that's part of it but it feels as
though that was a trump-related problem
a little bit right that our oligarchs
decided that kovid was going to be the
story and it was bad for trump and and
there you have it
um all right
but part of the part of that study said
that it didn't matter
if things were trending worse or better
with the pandemic
it didn't affect the coverage being 91
negative so the the the
allegation in this study was that uh
the news creates a narrative
that is in invulnerable to any change in
facts
chad says you're wrong scotty
i'm going to take that as uh as parody
all right uh
how did you enjoy today's special
thanksgiving
episode of coffee with scott adams i
feel like i was angrier than i wanted to
be
i ever spoken with martin gettys i have
not
not even not even sure who that is
um i release your mind and you release
the kraken somebody says
thanks for doing a thanksgiving episode
you know somebody asked me if i was
going to do this on thanksgiving to
which i say
two things number one if you sleep in
on weekends and holidays you're probably
not doing yourself a favor
it's a good habit to get into that you
keep your sleep schedule
similar no matter what's going on
because sleep's pretty important
even though i hate sleep and try to get
as little as possible i do try to keep
the same
you know approximate schedule so i'm
always going to get up early no matter
what
i enjoy it
and then the second thing is why
wouldn't i come here
i enjoy it i enjoy it so
on a holiday i want to do things i enjoy
somebody asked me about the great reset
which i still
call on
i believe the great reset is all about
uh
people confusing the words it feels like
word thinking
because there's this idea that there's
you know the
the global elites want to cause this
great reset to consolidate power and
it's all part of a
grand scheme which i don't believe any
of
and then there's justin trudeau who used
the phrase
uh you know we have a reset because of
the pandemic
a completely different use of the word
in a whole different context but because
people are people they said hey
you use that word reset in a completely
different context
therefore this completely other
different story
that uses the word reset must be true
no the only thing that's in common is
that word
now is it true that there will be a
reset
of course the the pandemic makes us
rethink everything
have to change how we're doing of course
it's a reset
how could it be anything else of course
but it's not that you know weird
conspiracy thing where the elites are
having a meeting in davos or whatever
the hell
george soros is behind it's none of that
or at least there's no evidence of it
that i have seen let me be clear and not
and not say what my critics say i'll
just say that
i am not personally
aware of any evidence that would make me
think the great reset
is anything but ridiculous cue talk
doesn't mean it's not true just means
i'm not personally aware of any evidence
um
am i aware of vox day i i'm aware there
is somebody with that name that's about
what i'm aware of
um yes justin trudeau said great reset
but words can be used in different
contexts
and that was a different context that's
all it was
if you think that you discovered a
secret world plot
because justin trudeau said it directly
on television
you really need to check your thinking
because if it was really this great
clever
secret plot i'm pretty sure justin
trudeau
would not have revealed it in his speech
how do we get rid of propaganda and back
to truth
i would argue that we've never been at
truth we just didn't know it
so when i talked about trump changing
the nature of reality
what people thought they are seeing is
that he changed
the reality now he did change the
reality
but on top of that he also changed how
we see the reality that was already
there
before trump you probably thought your
elections were pretty secure
you probably thought your social media
was a little biased but how big a deal
is that
maybe you thought that your news was
real
trump taught you that your observation
of reality is
deeply subjective and you're probably
getting brainwashed
wasn't new it was only new to you
it wasn't something that i didn't know
and in 2015 when i said i think it was
2015
when i said that trump would change your
understanding of
reality it was this
this is the part i was telling you was
coming i could see it as clearly
as i could see you know my hand in front
of my face
you could tell that he was going to mess
up what you thought of your own ability
to understand your reality
in a way that could never be put back in
the bottle and the biggest way he did it
was by departing from the fact-checking
all the time because he realized
that the facts are not persuasive and we
don't live in a world where facts matter
at least you know matter for persuasion
they matter for reality but not
persuasion
i think the president when when people
are trying to understand
why does he keep saying things that
aren't true when
he must have figured out by now they're
not true
somebody who's told them it's not true
and i would say that the
the big reality mind
effort that some of you are already at
and some of you are almost there is this
he might know that it doesn't matter
indeed he was right he became president
without paying any attention to the
specificity of the fact
checking none he he treated it like it
literally didn't matter
at all and what happened he was right
he was 100 right none of the fact
checking
mattered none of it what did matter
is how the networks covered it and
social media
handled it etc but it didn't matter if
it was true
and it didn't matter if it wasn't true
so long as it was
you know well intended to move the
country in a good direction that's what
mattered
um okay that's all for now
i will talk to you tomorrow have a great
thanksgiving
and you youtubers still here for you for
a minute
but i'm going to sign off in a second um
all right can president trump prove
election fraud
do it george washington and then come
back that's my prediction
that's my prediction uh my prediction is
that he will do it george washington
meaning that he will say yeah i won
but i'm also going to peacefully
transfer
whether he runs in again in 2024
i think that's a wait and see you know
it does make sense
that maybe he would say he's going to
maybe he thinks he'd like to
but i think age is just too big of a
variable
and i'd give it a give it a couple years
before you take it seriously
i'm grateful for you as well so so thank
you
and i'm grateful to all of you and i
mean that quite sincerely
this is this is usually the you know one
of the highlights of my day
except for the time i spend with
christina and
um i want you to have a great
thanksgiving
take care
