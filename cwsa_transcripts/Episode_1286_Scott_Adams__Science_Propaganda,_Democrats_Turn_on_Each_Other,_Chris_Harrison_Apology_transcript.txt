thanks for inviting people um
let's talk about all the news but before
we do that
let's get ready okay you know how to get
ready all you need is a cup of margaret

canteen gigaflask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like

it's called the simultaneous sip it's
famous all over the world and you're
about to enjoy it
go
you know as good as this is
it's still underrated yeah
still is i don't know if there's any way
to express how good that is
well let's see if we can do a little bit
better on
youtube today those of you watching on
youtube today
may have said to yourself hey scott i
was watching you yesterday in a live
stream and
suddenly your live stream froze up
was it because of the content
don't know so i i don't believe i got
any kind of a written notice
from youtube no but let me see if i did
i only read my email about once every
few days
maybe i should check my email see if
youtube
was warning me youtube
let's see nope i don't see any
messages from youtube
looks like it wasn't anything about that
so was it because i was talking about
the rasmussen poll
in which i used words to describe
something that democrats call the big
lie
now i believe i can refer to
the big lie because that's approved
speech
but i can't refer to what the big lie
refers to because i think if i say that
the algorithm might be not going to be
offline
but here's a question for you and i
would like to issue a challenge
to those of you who are uh really good
at looking for data
and the challenge goes like this i want
you to find
for me the first use
by let's say somebody who's at least a
blue check
a blue check twitter use
or it could be an article it could be
something you saw on tv
but let's say a major something on a
major network
or from a blue check person the first
person who used the phrase
the big lie when referring to
the election allegations all right
so see if you can find the first use of
that
here's why i'm mentioning it all right
there's a
there's a uh what would i call it uh
i'm not gonna call it a conspiracy
theory yet
because i would that would imply that
somebody believes that i suppose
but let's say there's a suggestion
that the democrats have been pulling
from a a
source let's say that they found a
source of power
that they used successfully in the past
year
and especially successfully in the
election
now i'm not saying this is true
so this is not me saying oh this is a
true thing
this is me saying i've heard people say
this is true
just putting it out there i'll probably
be
kicked off of there is a really good
oh how did you get ahead of me how did
somebody get ahead of me in the comments
i thought i was going to surprise you
all with this
and somebody in the comments is already
at the end point
so let me just skip to the end it has
been said and i can't confirm this
but it's been said that if you read the
right
nazi propaganda stuff
if you read how the nazis
brainwashed their own public
you will learn their techniques and it's
really strong technique
now i don't know how much if any of that
would be in minecomp if i haven't read
it i don't plan to
um now as a hypnotist as a trained
hypnotist who has much interest in all
things persuasion
when i heard that there is this secret
powerful source of persuasive technique
i said to myself i'd sure like to know
what that is
and then the smarter part of my brain
says don't go looking for that scott
don't don't you go looking for that
because sooner or later somebody's gonna
say
have you ever read mind conf
and i don't want to answer yes and i
don't want to lie
so i'm not going to read it all right so
that's not going to be on my reading
list
but it has been said by people that i
believe
are quite smart and well informed that
if one
if one were to go down that dark path
they would find
some persuasion techniques that are
solid gold
and of course obviously work now when i
hear this phrase the big lie
which obviously has you know its origins
from a quote from nazi germany that
if you tell a lie that's big enough
a big enough lie it's easier to sell it
than a small lie
and so we see the democrats referring to
any allegations about the election as
the big lie
so they've sort of taken this
imagery from the nazis and applied it
but that's not what i'm talking about
exactly
i mean that specific example is not
necessarily an example of specific you
know
nazi propaganda then there's also the
uh the suggestion that the nazis didn't
invent it
that they they actually got it from
america
from uh our advertising technology
bernays
famous famous guy in that field so i
don't know if any of that's true
so i don't know if uh you know if we if
our marketing came from the nazis or the
nazis
got their technique from uh
from our marketing i don't know so but
there are suggestions
that that's out there and the suggestion
is that the
uh the democrats powered up
by studying these techniques
now i don't know if that's true and i'm
not going to say that
i've seen any evidence of it firsthand
but i want you to just research this one
question
who first who was prominent
you know prominent person who first used
the phrase the big lie
when talking about the 2020 election
find that out for me
because you might find out where this
stuff is coming from
now the person who said it first isn't
going to be the person who necessarily
came up with the idea
but you might find out who is talking to
the people
coming up with the ideas so it might
tell you something
just let me know if you find out where
that came from because this big lie
thing
is suggestive of somebody at a higher
level of
persuasive talent than the average
politician just throwing out insults to
the other team
it has it has a feel this big lie thing
because it caught on and everybody
seemed to be using it
it has a feel of a professional
not childini and the reason i say that
is because as far as i know
all you know all information that i have
access to
is that gildini is not
a bad person and whoever came up with
this
whoever came up with this big lie thing
there's some bad people back there
behind the curtain and i don't think
he's one of them
so when i i would be surprised amazed
really if he had anything to do with
this
so let me support him that way all right
um
let me let me summarize my feeling about
the
impeachment decision the acquittal
so first of all i'm going to say that
trump is somebody who was
acquitted twice of impeachment charges
some will say he was impeached twice and
technically that is correct
but it's also true that he was acquitted
both times
so when i talk about it just to annoy
people i'm going to focus on the
acquitted part
um she says come on man
finish well i did finish so the
the theory there is that there might be
some nazi technology that the democrats
are using
but just figure out where that big lie
started
might give you a hint as to whether or
not they're using any uh
any super persuasion um
if i had been in the senate i would have
voted to convict
trump on this latest impeachment
so let me say that as clearly as
possible if i were in the senate
republican or democrat i would have
voted to convict trump for impeachment
but i would be completely ignoring the
charge
and i would be completely ignoring the
constitution to do it
and do you know why i would do that
i would feel he didn't do enough to save
me
it would just be personal so if i were
voting i would just vote personally
i would say i don't think you did enough
to save me
it's personal i wouldn't even care about
the constitution
i'm being honest i wouldn't even care
about the constitution
wouldn't care about the president
wouldn't care if it looked like
a lie wouldn't care about
anything
if i had been in the senate and my
president didn't do enough
to stop it after it started forget about
whether he incited it
i i wouldn't convict him for inciting
because i don't think that's real
and i and i just wouldn't have
but if i didn't think he did enough to
save
my life oh yeah i'd vote to
convict
i wouldn't even care what the
constitution said i'm being honest
i would ignore the constitution i would
ignore my duty as a
an elected official and i would have
voted to convict his ass
for not do it enough to save me
period now i'm not in the congress right
i'm not in the senate
so i don't have to vote that way and i
have the comfort of being
having some distance i don't have any
ptsd
it's not personal to me and under those
conditions i actually agree with mitch
mcconnell's
vote i agree that it probably is pretty
important
to at least try to establish a
maybe a mini precedent that the senate
doesn't have
jurisdiction over people out of office
now the senate voted that they do have
jurisdiction
do you like a situation where the senate
can vote to give themselves
constitutional powers because it feels
like that was what happened
if that's not technically what happened
but doesn't it feel like the
the senate just voted itself some new
constitutional powers
by voting that it was constitutional
to impeach a president who's left office
i think mcconnell was
the adult in the room where he said
everything that needed to be said about
the situation
he expressed his personal disgust which
i would have shared
completely had i been in the building
and been in the senate
agree completely with mitch mcconnell
on that topic uh
but i like the fact that he that he made
his final decision based on a
point of systems integrity really
systems integrity you don't want to be
even if it's legal
you don't want to be impeaching people
out of office
it's just not good for the future so
good for him
now the other the most interesting thing
that's happening as a big trend
is that the news business has run out of
targets
because trump is not there and he is the
best target for them
so they're starting to turn on democrats
because the democrats have power and
they report about power and to do their
job they're going to be
let's say appropriately aggressive about
challenging power and we're seeing that
happen
in some interesting ways but it's it's
still kind of polite
there's a level of politeness now even
though they're going after some democrat
targets so here's some examples
um jake tapper
to his credit has this weekend he went
really hard at governor cuomo
not only for the nursing nursing home
decision to
release infected people to nursing homes
but also for the cover-up
of the number of people who were there
and it didn't look like
to me it didn't look like he was pulling
any punches it looked like
yeah at least jake tapper went hard
after governor cuomo and i feel it was
entirely appropriate
so um i'm gonna call it out when
when something that makes sense happens
but he also went
hard jake tapper did at the head of the
cdc
on school openings if you haven't seen
that clip
of jake dapper interviewing the head of
the new director of the cdc
you have to watch that it's really
interesting
because there are two things number one
it's clear that she wasn't answering the
question in a coherent way
and that's her biggest job if you're the
director of the cdc
you can be right or you could be wrong
but you need to be clear all right
you need to you need to communicate in a
way that
people understand what it is you're
saying
at least understand what you're telling
us could be wrong could be right we get
that right and
people aren't right every time but man
she was a she was a shipwreck and
watching jake tapper
press her and and let me give cnn credit
for this
it felt like they could have cut that uh
they could have cut that short
because he let her talk for a long time
not answering the question
and it looked like maybe the producers
probably were whispering
in his ear just stay on this like
like don't let this go and he just
stayed on it
and watching watching it live or you
know it was
live when it happened but recorded when
i saw it it was really interesting
to watch impress her now what the
problem was that she was saying
that he was pressing her to be true to
the statement
that they would follow science now you
know what the trap is right
there's a trap when you become the party
that says we're gonna follow science
you just painted yourself in the
corner
because people don't agree what science
is
and guaranteed there will be times when
your politics
make you take a decision that doesn't
look like science
so the democrats have painted themselves
in a very bad
corner and jake tapper just cornered the
director of the cdt
cdc and just spanked her for like five
minutes
and the the problem was that she
couldn't explain
how we could use science to reopen the
schools
so it used to be yes fauci and others
were saying reopen the schools
and now that's morphed into reopen the
schools
after the stimulus thing gets passed and
then maybe they can buy enough
mitigating stuff like basks and shields
and stuff
that maybe someday under the right
conditions and also if the infection
rate got down to a low enough level
if all of this happens then we can
reopen schools
and jake to his credit was looking for a
little more clarity than that because
he's saying
but we probably can't do that stuff
effectively i'm
i'm doing a bad job of paraphrasing but
the the effective pushback was
yeah but you said we could open schools
science says but now you're saying that
the way to do it
is actually functionally impossible so
are you saying open schools
or are you saying we can't really do it
because we can't get there to there from
here
there are too many requirements to be
met it just can't happen at least within
the time that we wanted to
and watching him hammer her was fun but
i have to say
it looked a lot more polite than it
would have been in the trump
administration
i think i think that the cdc director
would have been
annihilated if she'd been in the trump
administration
as it was jake was just treating her
like she was
being obtuse or intentionally wasn't
being useful and and that came across
and i think he was right about that all
right
so here's what i tweeted this morning
and it's probably the most important
thing you need to know
nobody is following the science and the
reason that nobody is following the
science
even though some people say they are is
that it's not a thing
you can't you following the science is
like saying
well today i'm going to saddle up my
unicorn
and go for a ride on my flying unicorn
it's something you can say but you can't
do it
you can't do it because there's no
unicorn
that flies likewise
you have no access to science
you don't when you talk about science
have you done
did you do the study were you there
no the only thing you have is that
somebody
wrote up what happened when you weren't
there
and then somebody else read was somebody
else wrote about something
and then they interpreted it and put
their spin
on what that means and then you heard it
and then your brain interpreted it again
probably wrong
you are so many levels away from science
is that like three entire levels away
from science
so to say that you follow the science is
a lot like saying you ride a flying
unicorn
you can't all you can do
is listen to what people who read
something written by scientists said
who don't know how to interpret it
necessarily who don't know if those
scientists were paid who don't know if
that study
was going to be repeatable and something
that
lives or something that dies what
what percentage confidence should you
put on a new study
that says let's say let's say tomorrow a
new study comes out
and real scientists review it it's
peer-reviewed it's in a publication
and it says that eating eating mashed
potatoes will protect you from
coronavirus
now it doesn't matter what it says just
say there's a new study
what what percentage odds would you put
on the new study
that it ends up being true you know it
takes more studies and
you have to repeat it it takes a long
time to know if something's true
but if you hear the first study mashed
potatoes
helps you cure coronavirus what
percentage
confidence should you put on that
zero zero if you don't know that the
that you should put zero confidence on
that
and you think you're following science
you're not
because if you put more than zero
confidence on that
you don't understand science now
here's the best way to look at a new
study that cl that makes a claim
the most productive way to look at it is
that that study
has entered into the um the set of
possible
explanations a new possibility so if a
study says something's
true according to the study
your interpretation as a citizen should
be
that's one more thing that could be true
it's it's now in the set of things you
should consider
but the odds of it being true are just
small right that's the way new studies
work
you should put very low confidence in
them now unfortunately if those studies
agree with what you want to be true
like every time i see a vitamin d study
that suggests it's going to help with
coronavirus
i want to believe that because i had
said early on that i thought it would be
true
so since it agrees with what i want to
be true
i'm like i'm going to believe those
studies but then you look into them a
little bit
and the vitamin d that they're talking
about is not the kind you can buy over
the counter
it's not even the kind you can get from
being in the sun it's like some special
you know activated kind of vitamin d i
don't even understand the details
which is my point what could be easier
than this question science says
vitamin d helps against coronavirus
you could understand that right did a
bunch of studies
we found that the vitamin d is low and
people who die from coronavirus on
average
therefore what
we can't even interpret that correctly
because most of the people would say oh
you just proved
that taking more vitamin d will help
with my coronavirus
and nothing like that happened here's
what was proven
there's a correlation but you don't know
which way it goes
it could be that people are sickly in
general have low vitamin d
so of course they're the ones dying it
could be that the people were saved
by vitamin d you know in the studies
where they gave them vitamin d
once they had symptoms and you could see
that you know this group didn't progress
to get sick and then you say great i'll
go to the store i'll buy some vitamin d
i'll go in the sun and i'll be good but
you have misinterpreted
what they meant by vitamin d because
that's not the vitamin d you can buy
it's the activated stuff now is what i'm
saying
true when i say that the studies say
it's
regular that when they mention vitamin d
they don't mean the kind you can buy
over the counter
it's like the special hospital version
of activated vitamin d whatever that is
is anything i said now true how the hell
would you know
how would you know am i a scientist
did i do a study on vitamin d what you
should believe
about what anything i just said about
vitamin d
is zero zero credibility
that's what you should put on what i
just said the only thing you should take
away from it is
let's put vitamin d into the set of
things
which might be important that's about it
that's about all you can say you can't
say it works
you can't say that taking vitamin d will
help you you can't say
any of those things and if you thought
that you acquired any sense of certainty
by listening to me
i hope i hope you didn't because you
shouldn't
so when we talk about the news think
about the people who
i'm sorry when we think about science
think about the people who tell you what
the science is
so the same organizations and groups of
people
who tell you what the science says they
interpret for you the science brought
you the russia collusion hoax
they brought you the president says you
should drink bleach
for coronavirus hoax they brought you
the fine people hoax the
covington kid hoax do i have to go on
i could just list hoaxes all day long
and then i could list things that they
said wrong
that they corrected for example the new
york times is correcting
the story that one of the capital
assault
rider people killed a law enforcement
guy
by hitting him with a fire extinguisher
so that was the actual news yeah
officer seknik i think and so that was
the news and the paper of record for how
long
and now the news is well none of that
happened
none of that happened the this is the
same news that
reported that this was a coup attempt on
january 6
or an insurrection nothing like that
happened
but it was in the news i mean it was
certainly a riot it was bad
and it was bad in all the ways that you
know violence and illegal activities are
bad
but it wasn't a coup they weren't going
to haul the united states
because they captured a room right
so if the science that you have access
to
is filtered through the least credible
organization
in the world well no the least credible
organism no maybe the world
i'll put that out there because i've had
another point about that
you're literally getting it from
professional liars
and that's what we're believing hey
let's trust the science
as interpreted by professional liars
with a gigantically long track record of
serial hoaxing
so um i've started to think that anybody
who says follow the science is
operating at a low level of awareness
doesn't mean they're dumb
it doesn't mean they're dumb doesn't
mean that their iq is low doesn't even
mean that they're not well informed
it's just a low level of awareness if
you're not aware
that people don't have access to science
that's a pretty low level of awareness a
higher level is that
you could have all the access you wanted
it wouldn't make any difference because
you can't understand the papers
and it's being interpreted by other
people that will influence you
all right now that speaking of science
now the cdc says that uh more than 38
million americans
have received their first dose of the
vaccine
uh that's what a little over 10 of the
country has the first dose
so somewhere between five and ten
percent of the country probably is
vaccinated
which honestly feels pathetic
doesn't it it honestly feels pathetic
now i think the biden administration
maybe takes a little responsibility
because they're new
but i'd say that's on the the trump
administration
that we don't have enough of it um
so when we decided was it impossible to
make more of it that quickly maybe this
is just the most you could make
so it could be that we shouldn't be
blaming
any administration uh maybe it's just
hard
and everybody was trying as hard as they
could and that's just all you could do
but here's what else the cdc says
at least one person from it quote it's
what we're doing right
staying apart wearing mass so the the
point was that the infection rate has
dropped
considerably so infection rates have
dropped
a lot recently does that make any sense
to you
why would infection rates drop a lot
when vaccinations are not really even
about infections
well a lot of people thought it was
maybe the
vaccinations were already starting to
work but the rate of infections dropping
was way too big for the infection
for the few amount of vaccinations
relative to the population
it didn't really make sense so now
they're saying that the reason that
we're dramatically lowering infections
is that people are doing a better job of
staying apart and wearing masks and not
traveling
and not mixing with others indoors says
dr tom frieden
former director of the former director
of the cdc so it's not the cdc he's the
former director
now that's that's science right so did
you just learn some science
and now an official person
just gave you some science said do you
buy it
this is in science this is people
talking about science and speculating
and
guessing blah blah but
here's what's obviously wrong with this
in the comments in the comments answer
this
your personal observation forget about
the rest of the world
just talking about your friends and
family your co-workers
people in your immediate vicinity are
they
doing better or worse lately
let's say the last month better or worse
as social distancing and masking so in
your comments just say better or worse
are people doing better or worse lately
in social distancing i'm going to vote
worse
that's my experience that people are
socially distancing less not more
so i'm looking at your comments now as
they're starting to come in i'm saying
uh i'll just read them same worse worse
better
let's see lots of them going by same
worse worse worse no change
worse worse
uh same same same better uh
exactly the same worse same worse by far
no change definitely worse worse worse
worse all right
so the it looks like the impression
uh on average people are different but
on average it looks like
our observations and keep in mind
we're people from all over the country
in many cases all over the world
i don't see better masking i don't see
better
not at all so
this is our science right here's a guy
who was dr tom frieden
he was a former director of the u.s
centers for disease control and
prevention
so that's science right
but it doesn't match your observation so
what are you going to believe
does this sound a little political or
maybe it's about
keeping you masked does this sound like
science
or does this sound like propaganda it's
propaganda isn't it
because this is somebody who let's just
say
has good intentions because i do think
everybody involved in the coronavirus
stuff
there's nobody who has bad intentions
unless china does
but you know there's nobody working on
this who has bad intentions
they're trying to help but is he trying
to give you
science or is he trying to help
because sometimes they're different if
he had told you the science
maybe you wouldn't behave the way that
is best for you
so it looks like he may be trying to get
people to behave a certain way
and that's not science that's
politics or persuasion opinion yeah
so all right um
benjamin weingarten tweeted this and
this is like
such a big point it's like a small tweet
it will you'll miss it but such an
important point he says the new york
times casually asserts
russian intervention was a factor behind
trump winning in 2016.
this so there was a recent story in
which they just threw it in a list of
factors
of why trump won including hillary
clinton being a bad candidate etc but
russian intervention was one of the
reasons
and as benjamin points out he says
this will be how the history is written
and it's an
absolute farce but when you casually
insert the lie
over and over it becomes my truth for
the ruling class
this is literally history
being incorrectly written right in front
of you
because is it true is it a true
statement that russian
intervention was a factor well what do
you call a factor
would would a few
bad memes on facebook
be a factor well suppose they changed
one vote how small does the impact have
to be
before you don't call it a factor
i feel as though it might be technically
true
that there was russian intervention
because we've seen that there are some
memes that looks like they were behind
but some of them were pro uh hillary
clinton
and some of them were pro-trump i think
more were pro-trump
but there weren't many of them i don't
know anybody who saw one
i i've never heard of anybody who says
they saw one
because there's a list of which ones
were the russian memes i never saw one
until i looked at the list of russian
memes
and when you look at them it's obvious
that they wouldn't have changed any
votes
they looked like they were done by high
school students as part of the class
project
so when the new york times just throws
that in there
like it's just now common knowledge and
one of the reasons was the russian
intervention
blah blah blah blah it just becomes
history
and it's not even close to true as far
as we know
it's not even close to true and the new
york times just turned it into the truth
by repetition and just throwing it in
there like everybody knows this is
common knowledge russian intervention
it's amazing to watch this happen right
in front of you
and then apparently the new york times
is did a little
correction on their story about the
police officer killed by the fire
extinguisher
so they had reported that until the uh
until the impeachment trial was over
so before the impeachment trial the
democrats had made a big deal about
trump uh supporters allegedly killing
this guy with a fire extinguisher
now i'm not uh for any trolls watching
i'm not
i'm not defending anybody who did
anything bad in the capitol
they all need to answer to the justice
system for
whatever they did nobody's arguing that
um but this was a lie
it just wasn't true and it was reported
by the
paper of record as new york times has
been called in the past
i don't think they deserve that title
anymore because they've done enough fake
news that you can't really
say if it's in the new york times it's
likely to be true anymore
unfortunately so
there you see it major propaganda
happening right in front of you
meanwhile in minneapolis minneapolis
decided
that they were going to increase their
budget to recruit more officers
police officers because of the sharp
rise in crime
and the fact that a number of officers
quit
so the whole defund the police turned
into fund the police more because
defunding the police didn't work
now
is it a coincidence that after biden is
elected
and after the trial that all of this
news starts coming out to show that
maybe
maybe trump was a little bit more right
than you thought and maybe the democrats
were a little bit more wrong than you
thought you know it's just
a little ways the truth is sort of if it
is the truth
starting to come out that you say to
yourself huh
i wonder if we had known this truth
some months ago if things might have
gone a different way
um i've told before that uh one of my
favorite
news people is fareed zakaria even when
i
don't agree with him he is wrecked with
a bad case of
trump derangement syndrome but he puts
on a really good show
there's a lot of good content on there
and
he was criticizing biden for his foreign
policy
now here's the funny part he started out
with his
criticism of biden's foreign policy
by saying that biden was so far a giant
success
in domestic policy and i thought to
myself
he is what giant success are we talking
about because i haven't seen any and
farie's example of a giant domestic
success
is that biden focused
on defeating the coronavirus to which i
said okay i like the fact that he's
focusing on it as a high priority
but what'd he do what's different
what what did biden do that would not
have happened under trump
was trump going to stop giving
vaccinations
and what about opening the schools right
trump wanted to open the schools and now
now biden's not so keen on that idea
so i don't see any big domestic success
i don't see any of them
at all nothing you could call that but
but then fareed goes on to criticize
biden for uh having said that they would
get back into the iran nuclear deal
and that they've been saying that for
years but when
then when it was time to do it because
biden now has the power
what do you think they decided to do
they put it under review that's right
one of the main things that biden was
running on
he's not sure he wants to do
so for years they've been criticizing
trump and then when it was their turn to
make the decision
they said not well we better do what
we've been saying for years we should do
no they said we better look into it
what the actual
they can't even make a decision on one
of their main
uh international things
that's pathetic now i'm actually happy
that he's not
not making the decision i'm happy that
he's reviewing it
it's always good to review things i
think they're going to end up
very close to where trump was
i think they're going to end up adopting
something pretty close
to trump's policy on iran which was the
opposite
of what they said we should do
so give freed credit for calling this
out this
this was a good point then but there's
more um
of course uh trump was tough on china
and he wanted sanctions on
uh trade which we have
so biden takes over and he was the you
know gigantic critic
of trade wars big critic of trade wars
it's huge mistake to have a trade war
with china
now he's in charge did he immediately
reverse
the trade sanctions nope
what he did was he said it would be the
sanctions would be
quote under review under review
now he ran for office
saying it was a gigantic mistake and
it's obvious to everyone
but now when it's his job
he's not so sure what did we elect
did you elect somebody with policies
apparently not all you elected was
somebody who would study
who would look into it all you got was
the guy who said he'd look into it
that's it
that's it i'll look into it
um how about the cuba policy he was
going to be not as hard on cuba
as trump was but nothing's changed
but they've got it under review it's
under review
so remember what i told you as soon as
it looked like biden was going to be the
president-elect i told you this
he's going to have a real problem
reversing a lot of trump's
stuff because trump's stuff a lot of it
was right no matter how much you think
you did
wrong that was a whole bunch of stuff
trump did right
and they were criticizing everything he
did like it was
all the same it didn't matter it was
just trump did it it must be wrong
and now they've got a real problem
they've painted themselves into a corner
in which they either have to do
something that i think at this point
they would even admit would be stupid
and bad for the country or
admit that they were lying the whole
time
keep in mind that biden ran
to get rid of the liar that was
just about the most important thing
besides the
uh fine people hoax those were like his
two
whose two pillars were get rid of the
liar
and get rid of this guy who said this
fine people thing
which never happened so biden ran
on honesty
and apparently he's breaking a lot of
promises
now one of the things that i don't think
trump gets enough credit for
is that well i would not defend his fact
checking
you know 20 000 whatever however many
things he said that didn't pass the fact
checking i i don't argue
against that i'm sure that that's a big
number
whatever it is but um
he did he did keep his campaign promises
better than just about anybody ever has
in the history of the world
if he had a choice of somebody you think
is nice and tells you the truth but they
don't keep their campaign promises
or somebody who tells a bunch of
hyperbole and
but they keep their campaign promises
which one do you pick
i think i'd take the campaign promise
keeper every time
i think i would uh and i don't think
trump will ever get enough credit for
that
but that that would i would say his
his attempt to keep his promises even if
you count the
the border wall is not successful you
could make a case either way
but he certainly tried like hell to keep
his promises
he tried like hell to do what he said he
was going to do
i feel like that was one of the most
i don't know the probably some of the
best leadership
of all time you know that doesn't take
away from
anything you want to criticize them
about for the capital assault etc
but he did keep his promises like a mofo
and i'm not going to forget that all
right
so even if you didn't like what he
promised at least he captured his
promise
there's a really funny uh video that i
tweeted
about somebody i think they were on a
bicycle going around new york city
looking at the outdoor dining
have you seen it it is really funny
because a lot of the restaurants
have built outdoor dining enclosures
some of them better than others now
in my town where the weather is
relatively you know doesn't get super
cold
they can put little heaters in there and
they can have an open flap
so you're actually a little bit closer
down doors
even though you've got some material
like you know tent
material up but you've got one side
that's completely open that's a lot of
airflow
not bad but in new york city apparently
a number of restaurants
have just built a separate building on
the sidewalk
it's got actual walls like wooden walls
real windows the kind you kind of you go
to the
you know you go to the store and you buy
a window you just put it actually glass
window
a physical door but in some cases
they'll like leave the door off but it's
otherwise just indoors
but it doesn't have air conditioning it
doesn't have air circulation
so the fact that the door is open how is
that
really different than just having the
restaurant itself open
and leaving the door open just leave the
door open
how is it exactly different what if we
just said
restaurants can have outdoor seating and
outdoors is now defined as anything with
the door open
and the windows maybe windows and door
doors or something like that
but i suppose if you were to turn off
the heat and the air conditioning
indoors open at least one one door
in one window maybe you need some kind
of a cross current i don't know
i would think that we should just make
that change
somebody says outdoors equals no doors
yeah
so the fact that new york is doing that
is hilarious but you have to see this
video of the guy
uh looking at them um chris harrison
tv host of the bachelor got in trouble
for
uh saying uh he said this about
one of the contestants who had in 2018
appeared at a
plantation themed party or an antebellum
or something
party about the old south and uh
people said hey that's uh
effectively that it makes light of
slavery because
that was the era of slavery et cetera so
the contestant was getting heat and then
when chris harrison was asked about it
um he said something about 2018
we looked at things differently than we
do in 2021
but it was sort of a weak non-comment
you know he wasn't he wasn't uh he
wasn't going hard at her
which i understand but he also
wasn't going too easy on her he was just
saying well you know you have to
understand the context
well that was enough to get him canceled
and he had to
take some time off from the show we
don't know how long but here's the part
that i loved
his apology his public apology
for for an infraction that i would call
on a scale of one to ten
a one maybe i'm not going to say it
wasn't a mistake but on a scale of one
to ten
a one one point five
something like that right but what he
did was
he gave an apology that was a ten
so he apologized like he had just slain
an entire orphanage like he went
way above what you would expect for
a crime that was a 1.5 out of 10.
and to the point where i thought it was
hilarious
and this has given me my idea for when i
get canceled
because you know i'm going to get
cancelled right
sort of a matter of time wouldn't you
say and
i don't know that i'll be canceled for
something i said or meant
i'm likely to be canceled for something
that somebody misinterpreted
that i said or meant right you all see
this coming right it's like
it's like this giant train light coming
right at me down the tunnel
i mean if i don't get canceled i'd be
amazed
but it looks like it's coming sooner or
later i think they just have to wait for
the right
they meaning my enemies many
they have to wait for the right
opportunity you know they've come after
me many many times
but they haven't quite hit got the kill
shot yet so i know it's coming
it's coming but
when they cancel me i will be issuing an
apology
and i'm going to tell you right now it's
going to be the funniest apology
you've ever read and you know why it's
going to be funny
because i'm going to play it serious
i am going to apologize so hard
that you will be screaming with laughter
i will do an apology like nobody's ever
apologized
and i'm going to make the apology so out
of whack
with the size of the imagined infraction
whatever
whatever they come up with for me that
you are just gonna laugh your
ass off
and you'll read it over and over but i
got the idea from
chris chris harrison i swear to god i
can't tell if he's kidding
i just don't know if he's joking i think
he's serious
but i don't know which is beautiful
that's that's what i want to go for
too so he says in his statement
in just a few parts i point out by
excusing historical racism
as if he had done that so the first part
of his statement is
by excusing historical racism he didn't
do that
so the very first thing he's doing is
confessing to something that clearly
didn't happen
he never excused historical racism or
even
close to it nothing even in that
universe
but he's going to take credit he's going
to take responsibility for this thing he
didn't do
he goes i defended it no he didn't
so that's the first thing i'm going to
do i'm going to agree
that i did all the things that obviously
i didn't do and i'm going to greet even
more than that
i'm going to i will confess to more than
i'm even
blamed for so that's the first thing
that's what he did
and i invoked the term awoke police
which is unacceptable oh yes
that's unacceptable the woke police
because that's another crime by itself
it wasn't bad enough
that he excused historical racism
which never happened but he also
used the term woke police and he's
feeling pretty bad about that
and he goes on he goes i am ashamed
over how uninformed i was i was so wrong
is he serious i was ashamed over how
uninformed i was i was so wrong
it goes on
what i now realize i have done is cause
harm
by wrongly speaking in a manner that
perpetuates racism
and for that i am so deeply sorry
i also apologize to my friend rachel
lindsay
for not listening to her better on a
topic she has a firsthand
understanding of and humbly thank the
members of bachelor nation
who have reached out to me to hold me
accountable
i promise to do better
and then then here's the topper
because quote i am dedicated
to getting educated on a more profound
and productive level
than ever before i want to ensure our
cast and crew members
to my friends colleagues and our fans
this is
this is not just a moment but a
commitment
to much greater understanding that i
will actively make
every day is he serious
is he i actually can't tell
i feel like he i feel like he took it
just a little bit over the line
so that people like me could have a
benefit of the doubt
and know that he's kidding
or is he or is he it could be that he
just got beat up so badly he just said
just tell me what to write
actually why don't you write it for me
and i'll just say i said it
like you wonder how that conversation
went
but so i've seen people say he caved
well let me let me say this when you see
me
cave and you will
i'm gonna cave a lot funnier than this
and this is pretty good
this is pretty good
all right lindsey graham has said he
predicts if the gop ever get back in
power in the
congress that they will impeach kamala
harris for bailing out the black lives
matter rioters
why not do you see any problem with that
argument
lindsey graham that they would impeach
kamala harris for bailing out the black
lives matter rioters because she did
that
she organized funds to bail out rioters
how could that not lead to more violence
how could that not incite more violence
letting out the very violent people who
did the violence
showing them that you support them from
a government level
how could that not create more violence
so uh lindsey graham is now on my good
list
because i said i could never support a
republican who doesn't at least
talk about impeaching biden for the fine
people hoax
but i think this is in the same same
realm right
whether it's over the fine people hoax
which i'd prefer
or or he i think he's being practical if
you went after
kamala harris for the blm rioter thing
you don't have to wonder if somebody
knew the truth right with the fine
people hoax
biden could always argue well i thought
it was true
because the news told me it was true and
that would be a good enough defense
actually
in fact i would even i would even vote
to not impeach
if biden got an impeachment
process against him for the fine people
hoax which clearly incited violence
and his defense was i heard it on the
news
so i believed it was true i would
actually
acquit him because that's actually a
good defense
right it's a good defense
but kamal harris doesn't have any i was
confused defense
because she was actively coming up with
the idea on her own of bailing out
the rioters so she knew exactly what
they did she knew what she was doing
there's no ambiguity about who did what
or who believed what
so i think lindsey graham is smart to
pick that one
instead of the fine people hoax because
that takes too much explaining
and and you have to make some
assumptions
the bbc has been banned in china it
looks like it's a retribution for
the uk banning a chinese state
media so
here's a question i asked on twitter
i'll give a little meat here
do you think that the press in the
united states is better
or worse than the press in china
at informing its own citizens of what's
happening
go in the comments who do you think
does a better job the press in the
united states
or the press in communist china that is
controlled by the government which one
does a better job
i'm seeing in your comments same same
same worse
worse same same same no idea
uh bbc is propaganda somebody says
far worse no way to tell not anymore all
right
here's the way to look at it if you were
a citizen
in china and this is more of a question
than a statement
if you're a citizen in china do you know
that your news is controlled by the
government
does the average chinese consumer of
news
know that their news is controlled by
the government
i think so right wouldn't they all know
that
so when they read a story that says your
government says we did a great job
on this or that how does the average
chinese
consumer of news process what is
obviously fake news
from their government i'm not there so i
don't know
but i'll make an assumption my
assumption is
that they know to discount it in their
heads
and so they don't believe it because
they know it comes from a non-credible
source
their government who wants you to
believe a certain thing
so in that case and i'm again i would i
would take a fact check on this because
i don't know enough about the culture i
haven't i've never traveled to china
so if i'm completely wrong on this let
me know
but it seems to me that it would be a
healthy situation to know that your news
is fake
like just to know it's fake
are you going to be misled if you know
it's fake
and then you also have uh if you have a
vpn you have at least
some way to get news from other sources
and you can check that your
government may be telling you a story
so our chinese news consumers
are they more confused than american
consumers
because remember americans got the
russia collusion hoax we got the fine
you know we got the fine people hoax the
drinking bleach
hoax the overfeeding goldfish hoax
and of course our politics is just a
team sport
that has no no semblance to anything
like objective news anymore
i don't think our news is better than
china's news
i don't think so i think it's similar
and might be worse and there might be
worse part
is that the problem with our news is
that half of the country believes it
no matter what the story is let's say
just political news
so when i'm talking about the news i'm
talking about political news
i'm not talking about you know hurricane
news
i feel as if a news organization which
legitimately lies to half of the country
consistently
might be worse because they believe it
half of the country might be worse than
a chinese press
in which nobody in the country i'm
exaggerating right but nobody in the
country believes it
i feel like that might be better i don't
know
i mean i don't there's no real way you
could compare those two things
because it depends on the topic et
cetera blah blah
but it doesn't feel like we have better
press than communist china
and and i'm being serious now there this
is not
just making a point i'm not just finding
a clever way to insult our press
i just don't see how it's necessarily
better
it might be i'm open to the idea that
it's better
just not sure it's not obvious to me
that it's better
all right that is what i wanted to talk
about
today somebody says why do you think it
is the way it is
uh it's team sport and tds
and sometimes for the money uh
it's all those things yeah it's not one
thing
um
somebody says cnn is owned by att cancel
your contract
well you know i'm not big on cancel
cancelling anything i'm not big on
boycotting things because you don't like
the politics of the people involved
but i am big on rewarding people
who were cancelled unfairly it's like
gina
carano the the woman who the actress who
got cancelled from the mandalorian by
disney
i'm happy to give her a little extra
attention and suggest that people watch
her
future work and and support her because
i think she got cancelled over
and likewise you know the ceo of goya
foods
i think we should just support people
who get cancelled
not cancel people the same way the other
side is
now you may say to me scott scott scott
if you don't fight back with maximum
force they will just
take over everything uh
i'm sensitive to that argument but i do
think
that there's a path to just make the
canceled people rich
and then that takes away the incentive
to cancel them there's no point in
canceling somebody
if they're going to come out ahead right
that ruins the whole cancellation
process so i'd rather ruin it by making
those who get canceled rich even if i
hate the people who got canceled
i might even agree with the people who
canceled them i might be offended by
what they said
you know if somebody gets cancelled for
using an offensive let's say ethnic term
i'm not in favor of that but i might be
in favor of
commerce not being affected by it so
um somebody says i respect your stance
but i canceled disney plus
well you know the problem with all the
streaming services is
after you watch that one that one show
that you bought the streaming service
for
you you don't really need it so i think
a lot of people just cancel the service
after they watch their one show
i just got hulu just to watch the
britney spears
uh special the biog or the documentary
and and now once i watch that one show
on hulu
i thought to myself well now at least
i've subscribed
so i've got all this other content i can
watch i'm looking through it last night
nothing really else i want to watch i
might i might watch
schlitz creek or something but basically
all of these streaming services have one
thing i want to watch
so once you're done with the mandalorian
[Music]
maybe you don't need disney plus so much
um by the way speaking of the uh britney
spears thing
you should watch that documentary it's
really interesting
how she lost the rights to her own money
and that her father was the executor
that's recently was reversed
so now there's a professional
organization that has to work with
her dad to manage her money so at least
the professionals are
a little bit of an audit on his his
actions
but the fact that and the saddest part
was that britney spears was saying
effectively there's only one person in
the world i don't want him
to be in charge of my money and it's my
father
and she couldn't get that done right
away she did get that done
finally at least shared responsibility
but
it was amazing that that could happen to
a human being
in this country that the court can just
take control of your life and give it to
somebody else
now obviously there are reasons there
are times when that's necessary
so i don't know that i want to lose that
ability if somebody's
elderly and they can't manage their
money etc but
giving it to the one family member that
you hate or that you don't trust
that's just a crime it certainly makes
sense
that some people need some help
temporarily or permanently
that part's cool but having the person
who helps the one person that person
doesn't want to be the one
that's not cool that's not cool
somebody says try going through a
divorce i've gone through a divorce
it's not fun at all but
we didn't fight in our divorce i just i
just made it easy
all right
um you'll manage my money sure
you know there's there's this weird
thing with uh
making a lot of money and i i would
label myself as
rich but not mega rich so
i'm on the the low end of rich people
i'm nowhere near a billionaire right
i suppose if i wanted to i could have a
private jet
but i wouldn't spend that much of my
total
net worth on a jet so
i'm sort of below the private private
jet level
of of wealth although i suppose i could
do it if i wanted to it doesn't mean
that much to me
and at my level and given my background
in economics i've got an mba et cetera
i can manage my own money
but at some level like say you were a
billionaire you kind of have to have
other people managing your money at
least a little bit
and i'm not comfortable with that at all
the one time i tried it for a little
while it was just a disaster so having
other people managing money is just a
terrible idea so i actually worry
that if somehow something happened to
turn me into a billionaire
that it would just be more work i don't
know that i would be happier
it would be more work all right that's
all for now and i will
that's a funny comp comment that i'm not
going to read and i'll talk to you later
okay youtubers we made it all the way to
the end today
without getting a glitch
i i don't have any reason to believe
that the glitch yesterday was
intentional or human inspired but it was
a big coincidence
if it wasn't
all right um
that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
