good morning everybody and welcome to
the best damn thing that ever happened
to you it's called coffee with scott
adams
i believe all my audio and everything is
working today and
you're going to come on a journey today
which will be one of the most wonderful
things that's ever happened to you
yeah and it begins with the simultaneous
bed and all you need is a couple of mug
or a glass of tanker chelsea's like a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid and
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's the omicron of beverages go
oh yeah
well rasmussen says 44 of people are
planning to make a new year's resolution
how about all of you do you plan to make
any new year's
resolutions
let me start you off with a resolutions
advice
it goes like this
i would recommend one
resolution
you might have a few more that are
unique to your situation
but there's one resolution probably
everybody should have
which is to create a fitness
system
so don't work on a goal
and don't worry about number of pounds
lost or muscle mass or anything like
that just work on creating a system that
works for you and the system would be
i'll give you some examples
let's say your problem is you can't find
time to exercise
so the system would be this
make sure that you're active every day
doesn't mean going to the gym could be a
long walk could be cleaning the garage
or cleaning the house or something but
make sure you're active every day
and that's your only system
be active every day
now to be active every day and to have
time i recommend a few things number one
if you can join any kind of an organized
exercise group
could be people riding bicycles could be
tennis players whatever if you get into
an organized group
it's easier to tell your loved ones
that there's a scheduled thing you have
to go to
it happens to be good for you it's
exercise but if you say to your spouse
you know i think i'll just
go exercise
and it's not a planned event sometimes
you get the well
wouldn't you rather do something with me
naturally right
so if you don't have a routine
that your important
significant others
recognize as your routine you're going
to have to negotiate every time you
exercise even if you're not talking
about it
you're mentally negotiating it's like
uh there's a bunch of stuff that needs
to get done
but i really need to exercise
all of that uncertainty can be
eliminated by being the person who
exercises every day at noon
or every day as soon as you get up
or every day as soon as you get back
from work whatever whatever the standard
is
if you can set a standard
it helps you
manage the other people in your life
because if you're in a family other
people are asking you for stuff all the
time right can you drive me here can you
do this can you look at that help me
lift this
you're continually being brought into
group activities and if you let yourself
do that you'll never have time to
exercise
so system one is find a time that you
can
broadcast or
or a system that you can broadcast your
loved ones it says at this time i do
exercise
then you've got a much better chance of
just conditioning them to say oh that's
just his routine that is no reflection
on us
has nothing to do with whether he wants
to be helpful or not helpful it's just
his technique
so that's one the other is i teach all
the time which is if you don't feel like
exercising because you usually don't
if you don't feel like exercising put on
your exercise clothes
because that's not so hard but give
yourself permission not to exercise
just put on your your workout outfit
your
especially your footwear
if you put on your
athletic footwear and your athletic
clothes and just hang around for a few
minutes
and watch what happens
the the fact that you just associated
the clothing
that usually is associated with being in
the mood to exercise can actually
influence you and next thing you know
you're like well
maybe i can't go to the gym
but i could certainly reorganize the
garage you know i'm dressed for it
so so use these little keys to to
hypnotize yourself into doing it the
other thing i do is give myself a reward
literally a treat like a dog
i give myself a dog treat except you
know the human version after exercise
in my case i like to have maybe a
protein shake
and a you know protein bar that i really
like
so i get a taste and food
like reward every time i exercise over
time
it actually makes a difference because
we're
we can be conditioned just like animals
so you give yourself a reward to make it
your routine you have a system where
there's some time to do it every day
if you don't feel like it put on the
clothes that make you feel like it
and then you know you might join a gym
you might find some friends to exercise
a whole bunch of other things you could
do so my system doesn't have to be your
system
i'm giving you examples
but i would ask you to do this
try a few things
try a few things for my list try a few
things you think of on your own but see
if you can come up with a regular system
that protects your exercise requirement
got that if you do that one thing
if you get fitness right
fitness ripples into all the other
elements of your life
so it's the biggest lever
we treat it like the smallest lover
don't we
but what's the first thing you skip
if things get tense
like if you're really busy
got a lot to do what's the first thing
you skip exercise right
and
uh and sometimes eating right because
you might have to you know grab some
junk food
but if you put them as a priority they
they ripple through everything else it's
a real tough thing to do it's hard to
wrap your mind around
making your selfish
physicality your preference when other
people have demands for you it's really
hard that's what the system will do
it'll protect you
from the outside demands a little bit
that's your tip of the day let's talk
about elaine maxwell
found guilty on several counts of sex
trafficking you've all heard it looks
like we will never see her little black
book and the records have been sealed
and the case is closed and now that
epstein's dead and galen is
apparently not under any obligation to
tell anybody anything else
everything that they knew
is now lost to us
maybe we'll find some other way in but
at the moment everything that
they know is lost to the public
or is it
uh you might ask if
if there are any kind of secret deals
that have been made don't know
but
let me ask you
this
in the comments
can you list how many things are a
problem for the public
because our government or some element
of the government
is intentionally
and directly
hiding information from you
how many how many examples of that do we
have right now
well we have the election system right
since the election system is not by its
design fully auto
auditable you can automate i'm sorry you
can audit portions of it you can recount
ballots and stuff but when you get to
the electronic part
which is pretty central to the whole
deal
we don't have any access to that
so the government hides from us
the
mechanisms of the election
it has lied to us about masks we know
that
whether basks work or not is is a
different question but they lied to us
about why they said it initially that
you shouldn't have them etc now we've
got the gelane maxwell thing and this
information is being hidden
again
and
recently
thomas massey representative massey
was tweeting that
he had garland
um
under oath
congress was
asking attorney general garland
some questions and one of the questions
that
representative massey asked was
how many federal employees were involved
with the january 6
protest
and according to massey
garland looked nervous now that's
subjective so you use your own
use your own judgment to know how much
credibility you put on that but but in
his opinion
garland looked nervous
and refused to answer the question
what
the attorney general refused to tell us
how many
not if not if they were involved
that wasn't the question if
but how many
um federal employees were involved in
either organizing or participating in
the january 6 protest
now
start start to put it all together
do you remember the theme that i've been
trying to
persuade
which is we've all been hypnotized
by the concept of innocent until proven
guilty
that only applies to citizens
because the government's big and
powerful
and then citizens need some kind of
protection
so we have that rule that you've got to
really prove it or you can't put us in
jail
makes sense
oh basically everybody agrees with that
rule there's nothing i don't think
there's anything in our world that's
closer to 100 agreement
than innocent until proven guilty as a
standard for citizens
but
your government has somehow convinced
you that that applies to them
nope
no it does not apply to a government a
government's the opposite
if the government is hiding information
from the public
the presumption has to be guilt
doesn't mean they're guilty
but the starting presumption has to be
guilt because otherwise you don't have a
workable system
your your citizens should be absolutely
obsessed
with getting information on transparency
about your government operations
and the government can't hide behind
well nothing's proven
no we don't have to prove it you have to
prove you're not hiding bad stuff from
us
because you have the power to hide
things
and if you have that power
you can just hide bad stuff
and if anybody has the power to hide bad
stuff
what are the odds that bad stuff will
happen
a hundred percent
over time you know not on day one but if
it's a big organization with lots of
power over people's lives lots of money
involved and you can hide
people's bad behavior
there's not a question
about whether or not bad behavior will
emerge
is guaranteed in the nature of human
beings you couldn't get any other result
and yet we act like now that's okay
you know we haven't proven it
there's there's no direct evidence
no that's the wrong standard
the government has to open the books
unless it's a state secret that is a
special case
all right
and until we get clear of that idea
we will be forever in this little prison
where the government can do absolutely
anything
anything it wants
yeah i mean that basically it's a it's
an invitation to
you know really bad abuse
what did all of the people on the left
say when the people who believed that
the 2020 election was not legitimate
what did they say when people
uh tried to take their case
to the courts which it turns out were
the wrong vehicle for uh deciding
whether
an election was accurate
people said hey
you have not given us evidence
of anything bad right and so and so the
democrats said presume innocence
if you couldn't prove it in court
i guess we have to presume the election
was fair
no
no that's that is a
brainwashing operation
that pure brainwashing the the
assumption of guilt
is your starting point not the
assumption of innocence
if you if you start with the assumption
of innocence for your government when
you can't check
you're in big trouble
we all know that i'm not telling you
something you don't know
i'm not telling you something that
everyone doesn't know it's literally the
most
known thing in the world
and we've somehow settled into this
zombie-like state where we say
well
the government has
we have no proof that the government
rigged the election therefore i guess
we're done here
no
no you're not done here
that's the start
the start is where's our damn
information where's my auditable
election who's who's working on that
who's making it audible if it wasn't
before who's working on it now i've i
don't know
why don't i know that
so
we have to be far more brutal as
citizens
on our government to
to just get rid of this illusion
that the government
is innocent until proven guilty
no
no no no and no
you are guilty until proven innocent
it's only it's only the other way for
citizens all right um and so this whole
galen maxwell thing i have no evidence
that any high level
government people were involved in this
in a way that if we knew their secrets
it would be very very bad i have no
evidence of that
but i presume
because my government is hiding here
from me i presume guilt i just don't
know the names right but i presume guilt
you'd be an idiot to presume otherwise
really doesn't mean you're right
right a presumption doesn't mean
accuracy but it's your starting
presumption it has to be
otherwise you just lost really
well
um let's test my uh predicting record
here the cdc came out and admitted
directly
uh and fouchy said this too i think that
uh taking the quarantine town time down
from 10 to five
wasn't just based on medical
information
it was based on how they thought they
could manage the public
and they thought that 10 days was more
than to manage the public could handle
but they might be able to get away with
five
who is the first public figure
who told you that all they were doing is
managing the public and it wasn't based
on a medical
you know new medical data
who told you that
me yeah i think i'm the first person to
say it because
while i am no expert on
virology
and i think that's clear
and in fact i'm no expert on a lot of
things
but if it's a situation about how a
bureaucracy is managing the downtrodden
uh
subservient uh masses
i'm pretty good at that that is my whole
career
is
looking at bureaucratic decisions and
and the real reasons behind them
so that's pretty much all i do for the
last 30 days 30 years is look at you
know management decisions and make fun
of them so this one when it went from 10
to 5 and they didn't back it up
immediately with data
that was just oh it's obvious this new
data takes it down from ten to five
uh it was kind of obvious
that they were responding to not not the
february one date because i don't know
if any of them have heard it
but responding to the fact that the
public was the dam was starting to break
you could see it right the the public
was was starting to
power up
and still is
you can feel it in real time can't you
now i've been telling you that the
government gets to lead things
until the public says um okay now you're
done if they do they don't always do
that but you can see that you know the
government's in control
as it should be at the beginning of any
emergency but you're watching the public
go from
you know you're telling us a little bit
now
we're getting a little smarter okay the
monopoly of information you used to have
all right it's getting smaller
we kind of know what you know at this
point
actually we might know more than you
know because it looks like you're lying
to us at this point all right
so that's what's happening the the
curves are are clearly going to cross
so when the public feels informed enough
and we're pretty close to it
even though we're poorly informed if we
feel informed enough
and we don't think the government is
serving us and it isn't because it's the
wrong tool for deciding which citizens
live and die in a in a non-war
environment the public's just gonna have
to take control and it's happening
so
i'm i'm way less concerned than a lot of
you are about the pandemic lasts forever
and
the you know it's all some plot to keep
us locked down because i would assume
that the government had that power
and i don't see any evidence of that
i only see evidence that the government
has power when the citizens
are not terribly involved
but with the the lockdowns and the
mandates and stuff the citizens are very
involved
you know there's nobody sending this one
out at least opinion-wise
right so when you put that many citizens
involved
it's not the government's decision
you know i i
i watched with amusement
as some european countries were doing
their uh protests you saw the mass
protests against the mandates in their
countries
and
did you wonder why you didn't see that
in the united states
did anybody wonder
like why why is france all up in arms
and it seems like several other european
countries were
were going nuts and the united states
weirdly
had not taken to the streets
can you explain that
well i don't have a full explanation but
i'll give you a few variables that would
be interesting what would that street
look like
imagine that all of the people who are
most
let's say concerned about mandated
vaccinations or mandated anything
if all the people most concerned hit the
streets what would it look like
it would be maggie hats
and black people
right
because those are two groups
that are sort of against mandates and
against vaccination mandates
specifically
so
could you really have a protest that was
half mega people and half
half black americans
i don't know i mean
you have to think that there's a at
least a little bit of
friction
keeping that kind of
activity from coming together you know
all the the history et cetera
so that that may be one reason but let
me tell you the other reason
guns
i think guns are the reason that the
united states has not uh
mass
formed some kind of protest the way
other european european countries have
here's my thinking
guns make you more confident
that in the end you win
you know what i mean
if you didn't have guns
to know that in the end you're going to
win you'd get a little worked up right
now
like you'd be all riled up because you'd
be like ah we got to do something
we got to do something now
but this is just a hypothesis so i'll
just put it out there if you know i i
don't have a ton of confidence in this
one but i think it's interesting
i feel that americans are confident
that in the end
when when everybody has enough
information
and it's time to make the final move
whatever that looks like i'll call it
the final move just for conversation
that whatever the the result of all this
pandemic stuff is the you know the the
end product
that when the american public decide
that they're ready to make the decision
they're not going to have to take out
their guns
i don't think that any guns will be
brandished in this process
i just think that we're confident that
nobody can take that power from us
does anybody feel that way
because i i looked at the you know the
mass protests in other places and i
thought they looked like powerless
people
trying to get power in other words they
formed groups
to create power that they felt they
didn't have individually
but i just don't know that we feel that
way in the united states
because of guns
am i wrong
i'm looking at your comments to see if
anybody's like feeling this
i mean i i can't think of any situation
where you wouldn't be more confident if
you had a gun
i mean you might be worried about
shooting yourself or something but
but
you know
don't don't you have confidence well let
me ask you this way don't you have
confidence
that the public
will control what happens with the
pandemic outcome
for the most part in terms of the big
stuff
do you have confidence in that because i
do
like a hundred percent
i don't have any doubt
you know it's taking way longer than we
wanted right
but it
but it took longer with reasons
it didn't take longer without reasons
you can argue with the reasons and i do
we all do actually we all have some part
of it we're arguing with right
but we also accept
that leadership is a flawed
process
and
um as i said on you know almost day one
of the pandemic
we should give our leaders
a break in advance
because they're going to be guessing
we need somebody to guess because you
can't do nothing
right you got to take your shot see what
happens adjust take your shot adjust
take your shot and for that you need
leaders
because the public wouldn't know what
shot to take when blah blah blah
so
a lot of leaders took a lot of shots
some some the same some different
but they couldn't have known what was
the right decision there just wasn't
always the right information for that
and
so now we're seeing the the outcome of
that would would you say that my initial
um
weird weird prediction
that you wouldn't be able to tell the
difference in leadership
by the final day of all of this if there
is such a thing
that you wouldn't be able to look back
and say oh that was good leadership
so you could tell that that country did
well because of their leadership
did anybody believe me when i said that
because that's if you think about it do
you feel how radical that uh that
prediction was
that there were like how many hundreds
of countries
and that you wouldn't find any countries
that you could identify leadership as
the reason
that they did well
didn't didn't you think that was crazy
and then you watched you watched that
right in front of you
you watched that develop right in front
of you
the
um
anyway
so
um let's see what else is going on uh
germany is closing uh
three of its last six remaining nuclear
reactors so the same time that germany
is closing their nuclear reactors which
most other countries and experts and in
this country both democrats and
republicans
by a majority i think
are pro-nuclear as really the
uh best way
to get through
climate change risk
and then some at the right would say
well it's also just the best energy
source that we have going so
climate change is just a bonus but you
have lots of people who are pro-nuclear
and a lot of that happened just in the
last year or two
thanks to a lot of great activism
uh michael schellenberger mark schneider
you know some of the people who made a
big difference i think in the least
public opinion in the united states
but at the same time the germany is
shutting down nuclear reactors
they are becoming dependent on russia
for
energy
am i right
so the two things we know germany is
doing is reducing their own ability to
create energy
you know they're going to substitute
green sources but we know they're less
reliable at the same time they're
increasing dependence
on
russia
am i wrong that that's the worst idea
i've ever heard in my life
that that feels so incompetent if if our
government did this
maybe it is maybe it is doing something
similarly dumb
uh
i don't know what to say about this
you know
i suppose history could prove them
correct in the end we'd all be surprised
but on on paper it doesn't even look
like it's a good play
you know i'm always in favor of a b
testing right well test it you never
know find out if it works if it does do
more of it
but this is not one of those cases
i think this just looks just looks like
a mistake
now it could turn out that the uh power
plants are closing down and have some
special situation
so before i get uh before i do what i
always criticize other people for doing
which is making a big opinion before you
know all the facts
let's not rule out
that maybe those three that they're
closing
have something special going on that
makes them a little less economical or a
little less danger or a little more
dangerous than something else i don't
know
i'm open to the other side of it
so cnn
was rocked by these uh sex crime
allegations not just adults
allegedly doing things with
non-consultant consenting adults
that would be cuomo and don lemon
accusations against them alleged i don't
know the truth of any of that
but
there are do be a fact jack is there are
there two
cnn producers who are alleged to be
pedophiles
do i have the number right it's two
right
now
you could say two points draws a line
uh but here's the thing
how unusual would it be to have two
producers working at one entity who were
pedophiles
not terribly unlikely right but what of
the odds they would both
sort of surface at nearly the same time
that makes it a little
more likely that they're not the only
ones wouldn't you say
it wouldn't be super unlikely for a big
organization to have two pedos
would it unfortunately not
right i don't know what the ratio of
pedo's to the public is but
take a guess what would be the ratio of
pedophiles to the public
under five percent
well it's probably a shockingly big
number no matter how small it is right
like if i say two percent it's going to
be shockingly horrifying
let's say one percent
so if you had 200 people working at
cnn
on average two pedos wouldn't matter
what the organization was right so the
fact that we found two
by itself
not that important
but the fact that they were found at
around the same time
adds a little bit of statistical
unlikelihood
if if that makes any sense
that it's just a coincidence
but it still could be it still could be
completely just a coincidence
so
yeah there are thousands of people
working for cnn of course not not just
hundreds
but
um
every time that we get closer to
something that q was predicting
it's just worth calling out for the fun
of it
um
so as you know there were you know
elements of the far right and maybe some
key believers who believe there was some
kind of organized pedo ring
that had government power of some sort
am i am i saying it right
can somebody give me a fact check on
that is that roughly
the idea that there were shadowy maybe
democrat maybe not i don't know uh
shadowy people in the government or at
least in power
you know adjacent to the government
and that they were organized and that
there were pedos and there were a lot of
them
now
the uh as i've as i've said since that
would involve individuals
they are presumed innocent until proven
guilty that's that's you know the
standard that we all agree on
as tough as it is
and yeah you know you have lots of
anecdotal you know i know i'm seeing the
podestas being named there again these
are all allegations and you have to be
careful because most allegations
that are that sensational turn out to be
false
right if you were to look at sensational
allegations in general
unless you have video or something
they're usually false
because they're sensational there's a
direct correlation
between how sensational the claim is and
how unlikely it is
you know now the exceptions are you
actually have solid evidence of it and
then that's a different situation
all right um
so
there's no evidence that anything is
organized
but let me ask you this how many
producers as cnn would it take
especially if they're producers for
the bigger shows how many how many pedo
producers would it take
before the reason for being anti-trump
looks like it's because trump was so
anti-pedo
you have to start wondering now two is
not enough
but it's close to enough
yeah if you had two major producers and
i don't know if they were major enough
but if you had two producers on a news
program
that is
anti-maga
and magga is almost branded as being
anti-pedo
right or at least a lot of the
a lot of the big names in that and were
associated with the right even if they
don't associate themselves with the
right
so you have to ask yourself was cnn's
coverage of trump in general
influenced by the fact that the
pedophiles have some influence on what
the news is
what do you think
because we don't live in a world where
people you know analyze the facts and
the reasons they they have emotional
reasons for whatever they do and then
they justify it after the fact but you
could
you could explain everything that cnn
has done
about his trump and maga coverage
by just saying yeah that's exactly what
you would do if you were a network of
pedophiles
no evidence that that exists right let
me be clear there's no evidence of a
network of predefined pedophiles
anywhere i mean not anywhere there's no
evidence of a network of pedophiles as
cnns
there are two alleged cases just to be
clear
but you can't ignore the fact that the
way they acted
would be completely predictable
if there were if they were run by a rig
of pedophiles
you get exactly the same outcome as what
we saw
now there are other reasons right they
could just have tds that that would
explain everything too
all right
uh pat paz say jack you know pass sajak
from
uh wheel of fortune yeah he had a funny
tweet he tweeted today i'm resigning my
position as cnn
i don't actually work there so it's
really preemptive
i don't know this there's just something
the way he worded that damn tweet that
made me laugh for 10 minutes
i guess it's this last part
i don't actually work there so it's
really preemptive
cnn is so bad that people are resigning
before they they get hired
even
without any chance of being hired
and so i said finally the leader we bel
we deserve pat sajak
and i'm all in behind his leadership so
i too would like to announce
um and this is an official announcement
i am resigning from cnn
i've never worked there
but like pat sajak i think you have to
be preemptive on this one
you don't you don't want to accidentally
slide into working there you want to
stop that
as soon as you think about it
i met pat sajak once
interesting story i was once on wheel of
fortune
but it was a local traveling version
they did it was still
patton passage jack and vanna white
so i got to meet them it was like a
little local celebrity
one
and uh
passage jack was was nice nice guy
anyway
just to
clean up this the cnn point
didn't the cnn coverage always seem
personal
didn't have that feel to it it didn't
even feel like they were talking about
the news
it just felt like it was a bunch of
people who were mad at somebody
and maybe the maybe the producers are
part of that reason
so yesterday i had all this uh happy
sounding optimistic news about this drug
fluvoxamine
as a treatment potential treatment
not validated by randomized controlled
trials
but it looks like it might have
indication for treating kovids
successfully and then i hear today that
it's really hard to get off it
so i don't know if a 10 10 days of this
drug
would give you
difficulty in quitting
but watch out for this one it's uh
getting off it is hard apparently so
that's what i'm learning today
um
so speaking of things
well i guess we already talked about
this yeah the ray apps thing
um i kind of just watched to see how
that would develop in the early fog of
war i have to admit i was not a believer
when people were saying oh it's the feds
they organized this thing i certainly
knew that that's a thing
i knew it could be true
but until i saw some evidence you know
it was just people talking
but now that there's enough video
evidence and
the questions that have been asked
have been pointedly
and directly non-answered
a direct non-answer to a question also
is a red flag
and apparently nobody's talking about
ray ups and that reyes isn't talking not
even to make statements or anything i
don't think i don't even think he's
issued a statement
but he exists people can find him you
know they know where he is
and this is one of these cases where
again you just have to assume guilt
until ray epps is the whole that story
is
flushed out
you have you the assumption should be
that it was rigged
the assumption should be doesn't mean it
was
again
with if you talk about the government
it's not an assumption of innocence it's
an assumption of guilt if there's all
kinds of smoke
right
if there's no smoke then you know you
don't have to be concerned that there
might be a fire but if there's all kinds
of smoke
guilty
guilty until
proven innocent which they could easily
do by
giving us access to ray epps and
telling us what they know or having
garland talk about it
under oath
so there are ways to know and if we
don't know
and we're not going to know you have to
assume guilt
assume guilt
don't assume that you know it's true
just assume that that's the system
that we have to use
just as it's a system to assume
innocence of a citizen
it should be our system to assume guilt
when the government says i'm not going
to tell you
just every time
now if they said i'm not going to tell
you because there's a state
secret involved
i'd still be a little suspicious but
here's what i'd do
i'd say are there people who are both
republicans and democrats
who do know the state secret
if yes
and more than one
okay
uh i'll give you that i'll give you a
pass
right would you agree that
if both democrats and republicans
multiple of them are on a committee
let's say
you know some security related committee
and they say we've seen the information
and yeah we don't think this is for the
public
good
good
but
short of that
short of an independent you know
bipartisan group saying this is a secret
if they just say we're not going to tell
you
guilty
guilty furthermore
while they stand clearly guilty by
assumption
right not legally guilty by assumption
does it make any sense to keep in jail
the january 6 protesters
who
have lesser charges and are not down on
bail it does not
it does not and
moreover i would say it borders on
illegal unethical immoral
unconstitutional i don't know how many
of those i could prove but they're all
right
right i don't know if i could prove them
but they're all true
so
so let's put a little more pressure on
our government with that standard guilty
guilty by assumption
guilty by assumption
and
don't talk me out of that
if you tell me you're not going to tell
me
and you don't have a bipartisan group
telling me it says stay secret
guilty
 guilty
and don't even ask us to pretend we
should consider the alternative
we should not consider the alternative
the alternative could be true
i'm not saying
i'm not saying we know that there's some
problem i'm saying that under these
conditions the government has told us
they're guilty
by assumption
if you don't get that
we can't we have no power over the
government and we need to have power
over the government to stay safe it's
just a better system
so guilty
guilty and uh
just guilty
and we shouldn't back down from that and
we should not
treat this as if it's a question we're
looking into
we should take it as a decision the
government has proven
by assumption
by their actions that they are presumed
guilty
it's not us
we didn't do it
it's not my presumption
i'm telling you that they told you to
presume they're guilty
if somebody says presume i'm guilty
believe them
doesn't mean it's true
but i think the smart move is to believe
them and the government just basically
told you to presume they're guilty
right now if the government came up with
a reason
that sounded halfway plausible i would
reassess
but if you don't get a reason
guilty by presumption and the government
is one who told us it's not us we're not
reading any tea leaves
that's just direct
it has to be our system
guilty by presumption and under this
situation
well dr robert malone was banned on
twitter which caused me to uh cause some
trouble but let me give you some
background first
back in the 90s or so
there were a lot of ceos who were
writing books about how successful they
were remember jack welsh
was famously you know touted as a great
manager for what he did at general
electric
now
um
and you might know
that that whole
business book you know the expert who
tells you how to be successful that that
whole market was huge
and then just fell off a fell off a
cliff
it fell off a cliff at the same time
that dilbert became a national
phenomenon and mocked those kinds of
books because they were always
that what happens is you've got a lot of
companies doing a lot of things some of
them succeed and when one of them
succeeds for whatever reason the manager
says i'm a genius and writes a book and
then all the people who don't understand
how anything works
say well this person managed that
company that company was a big success i
will listen to everything this person
says
doesn't make any sense
because what we do know is that g
basically
uh
screwed the pooch
using the same management techniques
that jack welch said
i think there's some story about
their accounting and especially the
financial part of ge
so that basically everything you thought
you knew about jack welch's management
genius
maybe not so much right
so our idea in the 90s that there was
such a thing as great managers who had
great technique
was completely debunked
by dilbert
more than anything else
is any will anybody back me on that
that the 90s were all about these genius
managers and that dilbert was mostly
more than anything else what completely
took the piss out of that
right
okay i'm seeing agreement on locals
people who are
more familiar with my past i think
so just use this as this is just a
primer for the story i'm going to tell
just know
that when anybody gets lucky is in
success
they will write a book and tell you that
they knew all along that doing these
things would cause them to be successful
it doesn't mean those things made them
successful
all right
it's just an illusion
now let's get to the people who were the
rogues on the pandemic
dr robert malone was one saying things
that were different from the mainstream
and he was just banned on twitter
now i don't know if it was permanent ban
but he tweeted
a tweet this is the one that got him
banned
uh that we the first six months of
pfizer shots
caused more illness uh than they
prevented
so that's the way he claimed and then
twitter abandoned for that
now
here's a test of your world view and i
do this on twitter
my my world view is that the rogue
doctors
might be really really good at their
expertise
it could be virology cardiology
one of those things they could be really
good at that but are not necessarily
talented at reading data and knowing if
if all the
you know the dots were put in there
so
i tested my worldview on twitter and
said i predict
that uh in the comments the idea
that dr malone's interpretation of the
data will be debunked
and that it was
by credible people who were really good
at debunking things and they pointed to
their work
you know they showed exactly what he got
wrong
and it's pretty clear it was wrong
now
here's an example of somebody
who read the data completely wrong
and it was so wrong that it got him
banned by twitter
but
was he wrong
on the point
was he wrong that let's say that
vaccines are not as
good in terms of cost benefit
as we had been sold
because there's larger claim
and i hate to characterize other
people's opinions is that it's always
dicey because when people do it to be
they
they get a lot wrong
but um
if we assume that uh people like dr
malone let's make it more general so
it's not about him if they were to say
that the vaccinations were not as good
as we had been told
but
it was based on misreading the data or
at least they didn't misread some data
these would be people who used incorrect
reasoning
but by luck
just like these managers who were who
look like geniuses because their company
did well
by luck they would also be right
so what do you do with the people who
use all the wrong data analysis
to get to the right answer
it's going to be a of all
clusterfucks because the people who are
wrong about everything and don't have
any reasoning skills
just said oh the government's lying and
they got it right
or they said that the big pharma is
lying
now some people said to me scott
you didn't really need to read the data
some of you are thinking that right now
you didn't need to read the data
you just have to look at the players
and follow the money
how many of you thought that like you
know you can't trust the government
you know you can't trust big pharma
you put them together
of course you can't trust it
right so did you need any data
to reach the opinion
that you couldn't trust those entities
no you didn't need any data for that
those are two entities with a track
record of enough bad behavior that you
couldn't automatically
believe they were telling you the truth
but let me ask you this
how many drugs are there in the world
that came from let's say big pharma
what's your guess what's the number of
approved drugs that one could buy in the
market
thousands
two thousands
i'm seeing weird numbers there ten
thousand i don't know let's say
thousands
of of the thousands of drugs that are
approved how many of them do you think
are actually just fake
and don't do anything
well as a percentage of all the approved
drugs that are actually on the market
what would you say
what's your guess what percentage yeah
it's not a zero definitely not zero
now there were there are lots that work
for some people and not others that's a
little different but how many do you
think are literally just don't work
your estimates are really high i'm
saying 50 95
5
we don't know do we
do we know
oh i'm guessing that
the system would fall apart
unless the number of drugs they got
through that don't work
is in that i'm going to say under 20
range
because if it were 80
it would just be so obvious
that you know nobody could miss it but
at 20
you would write it off to individual
differences wouldn't you
like well this drug works for most
people but
damn it i was in the 20
so
um
i think the people who said uh it's
coming from big pharma therefore we
can't trust it are accurate
but what were the odds
like what were the odds
because you got pretty long track record
of big pharma approving or getting
things approved
is it ten percent of the time they they
give you a fraud and it gets through
anyway
do you know because if you don't know
that
you couldn't be too positive
that it was a fraud
you could only know that you couldn't be
sure
because they have a track record of some
bad behavior
now my bel my uh
big company
let's say guess was that too many people
would be involved in the drug trials
for them to
be too um let's say too adventurous
with their claims in other words there
have to be
whistleblowers aplenty or at least
potential whistleblowers when you have a
trial that big there just have to be
multiple people who saw stuff
so if they could all if every one of
them kept it quiet
well that would be weird now you might
say to yourself well what about
oxycontin and purdue
that their salespeople just told doctors
complete lies for years and got away
with it complete lies told them the drug
was not addictive when it was super
addictive just a complete lie and but
the way they did that was by referring
to third-party research
that nobody had access to
so they purdue was a special case where
they could bury the the research by just
alluding to it and have an expert allude
to it and everybody just goes all right
well somebody knows so we'll just go
with it
but in the context of the pandemic
when all eyes were looking at vaccines
you have to think that a lot of eyeballs
saw the actual data
collection process
whereas at purdue nobody saw it because
it actually didn't exist they just made
it up
so unless you think
the trials had only you know a few
points of people who actually knew what
was really going on maybe it's possible
it's hard for me to think that they
would have done this intentionally when
the penalty would be outrageous
i mean to be caught as such a bad crime
i don't know if anybody would take that
chance
on the other hand
billions of dollars at stake when you
have billions of dollars at stake do
people take crazy chances
yeah they do
they do
because billions of dollars in this
thing
so
um i don't think you could be too
confident that just because you said big
pharma is not to be trusted that
therefore this specific thing could not
be trusted
because unless you know the ratio of
drugs that get produced that work
versus total frauds it's hard to say
that well
their track record means that these
vaccines won't work
because i would guess that almost
i don't if i i think at least 80 of the
things that get approved probably work
that would be my guess
but since i don't know that answer
either you don't know i don't know it's
hard to say that just knowing they're
not completely trustworthy gives you any
insight about this one vaccine
that doesn't make sense all you can say
for sure is you don't know
all right
here are some more uh when i when i
noted that people were going to get the
right answer for the wrong reason
uh i created a whole bunch of cognitive
dissonance and i've got a new tell to
give you
it's the content free response
uh zooby gave me one of these you know
zoopy
um zubi's great by the way but he and i
will probably have some
conversation when the pandemic is
winding down
about what was reasonable and what
wasn't
i hope we do have that conversation
zubi's great but his comment
to be saying that people who looked at
the data wrong
would accidentally get the right answer
in some cases
uh
he said scott and then just a laughy
face
so then there was a another user corona
wu-tang virus that's the name of the
user
who just responded to me
how high are you right now
and then there was a pioneer mcmanus
another user who just commented
just take the l scott
and then a number of people use there's
i don't know if there's some organized
way or they just like this word
but a lot of people said something like
this we're reaching levels of cope
we've never seen before in other words
saying that i'm trying to cope with the
fact that i was wrong and i'm fighting
that out now
except
what was i wrong about
i'm not aware of being wrong about
anything
was i i mean anything important
um
so there are a whole bunch of people who
are pretty sure
that i'm wrong about big stuff but they
don't have any examples they just have
this feeling
now i think that this is a tell for
cognitive dissonance i call it the
content-free tweet
where they they criticize you
but there's no criticism
it's like the form of a criticism but
about what
something i said
like what am i taking the l for
am i supposed to be taking a loss
and admitting i was wrong
about what topic are we on
i don't even know the topic
so there are all these people who are
telling me that i should admit i'm wrong
without telling me what the topic is
now i think that most of the things that
they feel like they disagreed with me on
were things that i i talked about the
odds
and that's it i just talked about the
odds of things
so i'm not sure those are predictions
exactly
all right so you're going to see a lot
of that but you're going to see every uh
here's the thing that'll be the funniest
the corona the omicron
is clearly a less or looks like it as
far as we know a less harmful virus we'd
all agree with that
is that clear enough yet i mean that
could be wrong too but at the moment it
looks like it's less dangerous
there were a lot of people at the
beginning of the pandemic who said
this virus is not dangerous
at the beginning of the pandemic they
were completely wrong
but because the data changed the facts
changed and the omicron came out
they turned into completely right
do you think that those people will say
you know i got lucky because this
omicron nobody could see coming exactly
i mean you could you could know that it
would attenuate but you wouldn't know
when and you wouldn't know if there
would be more deltas before it did right
so you couldn't have known that
but now there are people who are
claiming they knew all along that if we
just ignored it everything would be fine
but that only applies
if omicron comes along
right it's a whole different game if
we're delta to the max
so
there will be people claiming that they
were right all along even as all the
data changed
now my point of view is
that when the data was one way my
opinion was x and when the data changed
i adjusted my
opinion to match the new data
as far as we know
and people are pretty sure that i should
take the l
for changing my opinion when the actual
facts changed and it's not that our
knowledge of the facts changed the
actual facts changed the omicron
is a new fact
and it's different than the delta facts
right
uh
so there's there's still people saying
that the uh vaccinated
are the cause of the variance
how many of you think that
how many of you believe it's widely
going around how many you believe that
the vaccinations themselves
are a cause of variance
yeah the the counter argument to that
argument is that
variants are caused by more virus
so if you had a teacup full of virus it
won't create much
variant
if you had a stadium full of virus
you could be reasonably sure
it would create more variants
so
i i don't think there's any exception
that uh to the extent that vaccinated
people
before omicron right
had some more protection
probably reduce the variance but we
don't know
there's no way to know
oh
damn it
something bad just happened
um
but not to you don't worry about it
that's not your problem
uh like with
[Music]
somebody says masks could be stopping
the omicron well i doubt it
now there are a lot of people who say
that we know that mass work or don't
work do you believe that
how many have believed how many of you
believe
that we now have certainty or something
close to it about whether masks uh
reduce the odds of transmission
how many of you think we know the answer
that
i'm saying yeses i'm seeing a lot more
no's we still don't know yeah i'm on no
we don't know
we can definitely say that it didn't
seem like any of the variables except
maybe the vaccinations
had any obvious impact but that but we
also didn't have any controlled studies
so we wouldn't know
yeah
um when was the last time you didn't see
a used mask on your driveway
literally every time i walk into my
garage or onto my driveway there's
there's a
disposed mask that fell out of a car or
out of a pocket or something they're
just everywhere
there are so many masks everywhere
all right um that is my show for today
you can't blow on a candle with a mask
on well
yes
and uh that's all i got for now and i'm
sure you'll agree best live stream of
all time and we'll do this again
tomorrow
