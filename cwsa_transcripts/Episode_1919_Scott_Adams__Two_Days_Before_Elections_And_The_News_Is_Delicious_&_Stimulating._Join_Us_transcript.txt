good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization the day before election day
and
our minds are
I would say focused I would say that
things are starting to move in the right
direction maybe maybe we'll see how
would you like to take it up to a new
level of awareness to a higher Dimension
a higher level of performance than you
have ever experienced before well all
you need is a cupboard mug or a glass of
tanker jealous and the canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine the other day the
pre-election Sip that you've been
waiting for it's all going to happen now
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
yes it is laundry day I'm sorry I'm not
wearing my usual shirt sometimes you got
to do the laundry
[Music]
well I had been working pretty hard but
I managed to take some of my workload
off by hiring a part-time assistant
so thankfully a lot of the the chores
that one normally does
I managed to uh
I managed to put off on my part-time
assistant
who immediately had a sporting accident
uh and is on vacation right now
so
that didn't work out as well as I'd
hoped but but it will it will it's going
to get on track any moment now have you
seen the video of the Iranian women
knocking the headgear off of clerics and
Durant
it's really fun to watch so you know
you're watching the
the and I guess the government is
cracking down on the women who are
trying to not wear the traditional you
know face coverings and stuff
and it's becoming a really big deal the
protests continue I thought they would
be Stamped Out by now but they continue
so maybe this has some legs
but apparently there's a number of
videos you can see a compilation where
the the young women it looks like will
run up behind a cleric who's got on the
big hat what's the name of what's the
name of the headgear that a cleric wears
it's not a hat right
turban turbine
is it really a turban
headpiece
all right don't get all racist on me
let's call it a hat
um
and here and here's the fun part the
clerics tend to be not very athletic
but the young women are you know they
could just knock the hats off the
clerics and just run away because
there's nothing that Clara could do
about it and I thought to myself
uh the mullers or the clerics what would
be the correct word isn't a mullah a
higher level cleric
there's a cleric lower than a Mulla
I'm not sure how that all that works but
anyway
here's my suggestion
I think they should do more of that
but here's what I'll do if I were the
women in Iran I would start to all dress
alike uh everywhere
all the same I would wear all black
bottoms all black tops uh of the same
kind and then I would have a black uh
headgear and I would cover myself
completely in public
do you know why I do that because I'd be
knocking the hat off of every uh
cleric within miles
and they wouldn't be able to catch
anybody because they'd all look the same
right so I think that the Iranian women
should embrace and amplify they should
over cover themselves
and all look the same so they could be
knocking hats off clerics all day long
and nobody can get caught be like oh
 there's like 600 of them I have no
idea which one did that am I right
just just give them what they want just
all dressed the same wear masks and once
you cannot be identified go nuts
once you can't be identified go nuts
that's what they're asking for they're
asking for you to be completely
unidentified
give them what they want
show them what happens when you're
unidentified
give them exactly what they're asking
for
I've told you this before but man is it
true that remember when we were waiting
for uh AI artwork to someday be as good
as a human
that day passed a while ago AI art is
unambiguously better than human art
I've seen enough examples now where one
after another AI art I want to put on my
wall like I'll see it I'll go I would
put that in my wall that's actually
beautiful I don't really see human art
that makes me do that
I don't see human art that makes me want
to put it on a wall I can't remember the
last time like if I put up artwork is
that protest I like I'd rather have
nothing on my wall
uh but uh Brian Machiavelli did another
piece of artwork in which he just asked
it to do a Dilbert comic
um I'll show you which AI he was using
here in a moment and the artwork in my
opinion as a professional cartoonist
is equal to the best human cartoonist
just the art
but there's an interesting quality about
it that blows my freaking mind let me
show you here in a minute
so you won't be able to see it as
clearly as I want it but the the request
um from Machiavelli's underbelly was uh
to make a Delbert cartoon about a zebra
and interestingly
it made Dilbert part zebra not a zebra
giraffe I'm sorry per giraffe and look
look at the quality of the cartoon at
the bottom
that that is a hundred percent as good
as the best human cartoonist right there
there's there there's nothing missing on
that that's it's beautiful really and
like this art
like that bottom cartoon
that is so well designed
like I would put that on my wall it's
just cool to look at
now but here's the weird thing
do you notice that the humans
have weird characteristics like they
don't quite look like they have the
right features and stuff
they look all interesting but even from
one one panel to the next the AI is
making the person look different like
one has you know three lenses and blah
blah now here you want a freaky idea
do you want a really freaky idea
all right I'm going to build into this
this will just freak you the out
you ready for it
you know how you the human brain gives
you a perfect image of things that you
don't see perfectly you know that right
so for example you will have a memory of
something that didn't even happen the
false memory is pretty common we all
have them right you also if you're
watching let's say a tennis ball being
hit hard and it bounces near a line your
brain says
I saw that tennis ball I saw it hit the
ground and I know if it's in or out
but did you know you don't see that
tennis ball
your your brain or your eyes can only
pick up the tennis ball every depending
on the speed it's going it can only pick
up the tennis ball every five feet or
something
but all the stuff in between your brain
filled in and it wasn't there
but your memory is you saw the ball the
whole way you did not see the ball the
whole way your brain allowed you to
imagine you saw it the whole way now do
you accept do you accept that your brain
is in real time translating things into
things that are not true
do you agree with that your brain is
always translating your approximate
environment into a specific picture
which is not true
now what happens when you take AI
that you know high intelligence and you
train it to look at human faces
and then you tell them to reproduce a
human face in some artwork
and then the AI makes the human face
look different in each panel
all the time
all the time well it seems like it
doesn't seem to matter which AI you're
using and you can train the AI
to really know what a face looks like
right because faces are approximately
you know the same on the approximately
symmetrical right it knows what a nose
is it knows what eyes are it knows where
they appear on the face are you telling
me that AI can't make a human face
what should be the simplest thing right
now I'm going to blow your mind
you ready
you ready for this
get ready
it could be
the human faces
don't look the same from minute to
minute
and that we can't tell
because our human brain is making your
face look the same as it looked a minute
ago to me
what if
our faces don't look the same from
moment to moment
and that they're at that it's actually
like a you know is more like a wave
function
that your favorite your face is only a
potential face
and when somebody looks at it they're
picking up the potential they're forming
in their mind their own face and then
they lock it in
and so every time they look at you they
see that face that they've locked in but
your actual face is never the same
okay did I freak anybody out
because give me one other reason that AI
can't make a face the same twice in a
row there's no other reason because the
technology could easily do it the
technology is telling you what is
actually there
the AI is telling you that our faces are
not the same for a minute to moment
that's what it is
but we don't see it
now I'm not saying that's true I'm just
saying it might be
that that is within the realm of
something that could be true
which is freaky by itself even if it's
not true but I can't think of another
reason that AI can't make a face
I mean there's just no other reason
all right
um a real clear politics at a poll
asking people if we thought the country
was heading in the right direction or
the wrong direction I want to test your
intelligence many of you have not seen
this news but
I want to see if you can use your powers
of deduction
what percentage of the population thinks
that things are moving in the right
direction go
how are you doing that
how are you doing that
25.6 percent
you guys you guys and gals you impress
me I've never seen a group that could
guess things better than you but once
again
once again with no help whatsoever you
got the right answer almost all of you
so congratulations to you
yeah about a quarter of the country
things things are fine and in the right
direction now
I happen to be in the 25 percent
surprise
I I had a realization the other day
that two things are true I tweeted this
two things are true at the same time
you'll see if you agree with the first
one I think you'll agree with the first
one but not the second one the first one
everything appears to be broken
agree like everything in the world
all of our systems all of the way we
think about things education government
Supply chains military
correct right would you all agree now I
say seems broken right it appears broken
now that could be an impression right
when everything looks broken you could
be wrong
you know it could be like the face thing
you see it as broken but it's not so
broken
because remember the the central
fact of our human cognition is that
we're looking for problems
so we can fix them so we can survive
your brain is a problem identifier
is not built to keep you happy and
stupid because if it keeps you happy and
stupid you're also going to be dead
right because you won't see a problem
you need to see problems to stay alive
so you're you're a problem identifier
now add add to the world
news a news model that gets more clicks
for bad news right
there's a bad thing coming you'd better
get afraid
so now people are automatic problem
identifiers and solvers and then the
news model gives you nothing but
problems
what in the world would you think about
your world
you would think your world is falling
apart
because that's all you say right but
when was the last time you saw a big
news story about good news
hey here's a news story of something
that was working great
I try to give you those stories but even
when you see them in the Press They
Don't Really frame them that way it's
more like well the fact happened
but you know I'll tell you hey things
are moving in the right direction all
right here's my take so number one I
think we all agree everything looks
broken
and I would say that it is
I I would say it's not just that it
looks broken it's actually all broken
all of it
would you would you agree with that
would you take it further and say it
doesn't just look broken
it's broken
right in the sense of it's not where we
want it to be no not maybe 100 broken
but everything's not where we want it to
be
which is a perfect situation for humans
humans love it when things are not where
we want them to be that's like our
Perfect Situation
you're continually like ah got to build
this thing gotta fix this thing that's
where we're at our best
when everything's a little bit broken
and and we're like working on fixing it
it's the ideal human situation and we do
we do it well that the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters we do fix things
pretty well all right here's my
Uber optimistic take are you ready
everything's broken that's true
and we live in a self-correcting system
that our politics and our free markets
and our you know flow of information
which isn't as free as it could be but
it's getting better a hundred percent of
things are self-correcting
all of it everything is self-corrected
now I told you about you know Germany
was going to freeze over the winter
because they didn't have Russian gas and
then the most the latest report was oh
somehow they figured out enough how to
store enough gas so they can make it
through the winter they solved it right
now here's what I see happening because
everything's broken that gives you
license to improve it
did you ever work in a company where
something's working fine do you think
you could improve it
everybody would say why why are you
focusing on that it's fine
but everything looks broken which causes
us to try to fix everything we're we're
in this frenzy you know it's in society
in the world in general we're in a
frenzy
of redesign everything's getting
redesigned usually by the free market
right absolutely everything's being
redesigned from almost the bottom up
we're we're in a reinvention phase that
you won't recognize until
until it's you know toward the end but
you don't recognize we're in an in a
creative inventive phase that will be
one of the great ones
of all human history
right now I would argue that after World
War II
we had a creative you know explosion
wouldn't you say
you know and then there was the
Industrial Revolution creative explosion
Etc but I feel like we're we're in one
but you don't feel it when you're in it
it just feels like everything's broken
because you're just trying to fix
everything
but what it gets fixed
it will be better it'll be fixed better
than it was and I think that applies
everything from our energy policy to the
way we run elections to uh to Twitter to
you name it literally everything is
trending positive
if you look at it as a system that's you
know in the phase of correcting
so that's my optimism it does not say we
should not be vigilant about all of our
problems we'll do that automatically
because we're good at being vigilant
how many of you saw the video of John
fetterman giving his speech Outdoors he
had a bunch of American flags behind him
and the wind blew them all down while he
was talking
and Fox News had a article about how
social media was mocking it and you know
it had some had some tweets there from
some notable people saying funny things
and I could not be more angry at Fox
News today
Fox News was saying that people were
saying clever things about that
fetterman flag thing and they did not
include my tweet
that oversight cannot be forgiven
and so
since they only mentioned some lesser
clever tweets which were pretty good but
they were lesser clever
than the one I did
and my tweet was this
hypothetically if God had been trying to
warn us for months not to vote for a
particular candidate what would that
look like
come on I'm a professional joke writer
and I declare that was the best joke
written on this topic
now let me tell you why
this is a joke writing lesson for you so
you can take this way I've told you this
before but every time you see an example
it helps if you can do a punch line or a
joke
in which the the audience has to
fill in the details
that's your best joke like that's the
one that really works if if you over
specify you know what what you want
somebody to imagine well that could be a
good joke too but the great jokes are
where it takes you a moment to fill it
in and where do you fill it in you're
filling it in with your own stuff
so what I said God had been trying to
warn you for months
you can fill it in with everything that
happened to John fetterman which was a
tragedy I don't mean to make fun of a
medical problem but if you if you had
you're trying to fill it in you're like
okay
yeah that sounds very much like that old
joke you've all heard the joke the flood
waters are rising and neighbor knocks on
the on the elderly person's door and
says you know hey the water's Rising
come with us we're leaving right now and
the woman says no no you know God will
provide I'll be fine and the water rises
and you know the woman has to go up to
the second floor of her house and then a
boat comes up to the second floor window
and says get into the boat get in the
boat and she's like no God will provide
I'm fine then she has to ends up on the
roof of her house because the water is
risen and she's on the roof of the house
and a helicopter comes by and says get
on the helicopter you know put some rope
down she goes down now God will provide
the helicopter goes away well the water
rises she drowns and she goes to heaven
and she's talking to God in heaven and
she goes God what's up I've been
believing in you my whole life you know
I was sure you would provide what
happened
and God says I sent you a car I sent you
a boat I sent you a helicopter
and you know that's the joke
so sometimes the signs are there
maybe you should just recognize them
anyway yourself did so much like the
joke I couldn't
couldn't resist
there is a video on getter that's sort
of that Twitter competitor
which I'm not going to tell you is
credible
so don't assume this is credible because
if I told you it's credible I would be
kicked off of social media
probably not Twitter at the moment but
I'll just
describe it to you
so there's a woman who claims that she
was doing construction on a home that
she and her husband owns for a couple
years so it's a place that has been
abandoned but you can reach the mailbox
even though it's behind a chain link
fence fence right so you can sort of you
know reach in and get to the mailbox I
guess and
uh she found it was stuffed with uh
address changes
so a whole bunch of people
allegedly had changed their address to
her address which is an abandoned
building
now obviously the implication is that
people are doing things to be able to
vote by mail
fraudulently
right now no squatters there were no
people in there they were just using the
mailbox as a change of address place now
anecdotally I heard other reports of you
know this being a a ballot fraud thing
that people do Etc now question number
one
you have seen one
um real person apparently describing
what looks like a pretty credible claim
use your uh critical thinking to answer
this question
what are the odds it's true
go put the odds on it odds it's true
I'm saying 25 25 low one percent low
zero ten percent very good very good
very good let so do you remember what I
predicted would be true after the 2020
election if you remember I said a whole
bunch of times I said this over and over
again I said every claim you hear about
election fraud
is at least 95 chance likely to be false
95 percent
now what what was the final outcome of
all the 2020 claims
how close was I right I told you that
even if something is true
and I didn't have an opinion at that
that time I didn't know if there was
some true stuff but I told you that 95
of what people surface will definitely
not be true
right so when you see this new claim
just keep the 95 thing in your mind
now it looked very incredible to me
right if you put a gun to my head and
say and said all right you're gonna have
to bet whether this particular story was
true
I want to think it is
but then I have to retreat to my
rational mind and say okay the fact that
it looks true means what
how much credibility do you put on it's
on video it's a real person and it looks
true
what's that mean to you
nothing nothing in 2022 it doesn't have
any value
absolutely no value
and the first thing you ask yourself is
why is it only on getter
right
is there some reason that would be not
on other platforms yeah so it could be
you know from a different year
could be an operative who's just you
know doing an OP
it could be anything it could be
absolutely just anything
you don't know
all right
um CNN
um I'm gonna give yet another compliment
compliment to CNN you know uh being one
of its biggest critics for years
I feel like uh like I have some kind of
social obligation to tell you when they
do something right
and not only today do they have uh
Daniel Dale doing a hard fat fact check
on Biden and when I say A Hard fact
check he just goes right at him yeah
Daniel Dale went out Biden the way you
saw him go after Trump
I never thought I'd say it never thought
I'd say it but he just went right at it
he said lie lie lie not true lie yeah a
big stuff I'm not talking a little stuff
I'm talking about the major claims of
the president lie just lie
amazing so congratulations to CNN for
what looks like a successful business
pivot
you want more this will blow your mind
the day before elections
CNN's website
the following headline
opinion Democrats are out of touch with
American voters
that's a headline on CNN the day before
the election
Democrats are out of touch with American
voters and that it goes on in the
article to say that Republicans are
running for office on the actual issues
that people care about
can you believe that
oh two days I'm sorry two days before
election
I forgot what day it was
today feels like a Monday to me for some
reason
must be that time change
does that just blow your mind
my mind is completely blown by the fact
that something's going right
now remember I told you everything's
broken everything's broken
but it's all being redesigned right
you you tell me
was CNN broken a year ago and do you see
that they're redesigning in a way that's
useful to the country
yes or no would you agree that you see
it
it's not just me right you can see it is
Twitter better off than it was a year
ago I think so I mean it's a big mystery
where things will go but so you've got
CNN being
a responsible citizen congratulations
see you then completely successful I
don't know about their their ratings you
know I hope that I actually hope their
ratings improve
so I'm gonna I'm gonna root for CNN's
ratings to improve because I think
they're I think they're acting like
Patriots
is that too far
in my opinion CNN is taking a patriot
perspective on their business which is
to try to give you the actual news
which is different
all right too far baby
but that's another example of something
that's going right
uh Biden of course gaffed again and said
he wanted to close all the coal plants
and then somebody from his own party two
days before elections uh Joe manchin is
asking the president to apologize you
know if members of your own party are
asking you to apologize two days before
the midterms
that's not a good look
that's not good
now a year ago do you think that
Democrats were willing to admit that
Biden is uh brain damaged and useless
not so much right
a year ago even the Democrats would have
said oh stop making fun of his speech
defect he's fine
they don't say that now do they
am I right
there is a completely different tone
from the Democrats about their own
president
and that tone is oh
look what we look look what we did
maybe we should undo this
now you're going to get people who's
still supported because it's a political
world but
um but let me let me give you a little
story of something that happened to me I
want to see if any of you have had a
similar experience
so last night I went to a large ish
social Gathering
of people in my town so I don't want to
be any more specific than that so as a
large social gathering in my town
and I live in Northern California and
now we're outside of San Francisco
so what what do you assume is the
political nature of my town
it's just what you think right it's
exactly what you think
or is it
I spent an entire night at a at an event
and heard a number of pro-republican
statements from people privately
I heard zero Republic zero Democrat
supportive statements
zero
there wasn't one I don't think there was
anybody there
who was favorable to the Democrat
platform at the moment which is not to
say they weren't Democrats
if you could you know put on goggles and
see everybody's voting uh party I'll bet
you they're mostly Democrats I'll bet
there were at least 60 Democrats but you
don't see anybody talking about Biden
it's just not a thing
it's just not a thing
and you don't even see people agreeing
with wokeness at least within let's say
that the Suburban family kind of just
nobody
and
I used to feel
um like I was in a little bit of danger
when I just went out in public
you know what I mean if you're notable
as a trump supporter
there was a time when I I it would have
been dangerous for me just I was a
little wary even just going to the
grocery store
because I thought I'd be confronted with
somebody not necessarily physically but
you I thought somebody would get in my
face you know throw a milkshake on me or
something some like that but
I don't get any pushback anywhere where
I live
just think about that I mean people
recognize me at this point and they've
got a good idea what I'm up to I get no
pushback
zero there is not a single instance of
somebody in my own community
who's told me I've you know gone too far
or I'm a Nazi or I'm on the wrong side
nothing
so are you seeing this are you seeing
that in mixed Gatherings there is no
Biden support
or even Democrat support really people
will talk about abortion
that's sort of all they have
am I right that's all they have
and a lot of people don't care about
that as much as you imagine they do
uh yeah there was you know a little talk
Of Trump but even he's not the important
thing these days
all right we'll talk about Trump
um
MSNBC there's a clip on Twitter of MSNBC
interviewing Democrat
governor candidate or Governor Kathy
hokel
now
imagine MSNBC
interviewing a
Democratic governor
two days before an election
now how do you think that went
you think that would be really just a
friendly right they'd be trying to
they'd be trying to get uh vocal over
the the finish line
nope that didn't happen MSNBC just
slapped the out of her
I didn't know what I was looking at
there for a moment
yeah I I didn't catch the name of the
host but credit to the host
um
the host said you know I guess the the
con the con yeah the context was a crime
and the host says here's the problem we
don't feel safe I walk into my Pharmacy
and everything is on lockdown because of
shoplifters I'm not going in the subway
people don't feel safe in this town
that is the end of her isn't that
did MSNBC just drive a stake through her
 heart
it looked like it
it looked like even MSC NBC is like we
can't even do this anymore we just can't
do this anymore we have to kill you now
I mean politically not actually
I think they just drove a stake right
through her heart in on live TV because
and again I if somebody knows if you saw
the clip I'd like to give a shout out to
the host because that was good work that
was good work and that not just on a
team play
kind of basis
but it was it was good journalism this
is somebody who really got to it really
got under the hood there
I wish somebody would say her name just
so we could give her credit
all right well maybe maybe you'll see it
in the comments
Jack Dorsey uh has apologized
for a growing Twitter too quickly and
therefore you know being a participant I
I guess he would say for how many people
had to get laid off because he thinks it
grew a little too quickly
and um you know I appreciate that that
that's sort of a
it's kind of the context you wanted to
hear right didn't you wonder why there
were so many people
and could you actually get rid of a lot
of people and still run the company
and probably yes if grew too fast is a
true statement and it certainly looks
that way then probably there's a little
bit of or maybe a lot of uh you know
cushion stuff they can cut
um so that's happening
um I you know it's I was trying to
imagine what it would be like
to be Jack Dorsey and know that all
these layoffs are happening like that's
got to be it's just gonna be crushing
um I once had to close a restaurant
uh two restaurants actually but I had to
close a restaurant that wasn't working
out and you know had to I had to tell
the staff that they were all fired you
know with
Severance and stuff like that so they
were treated well
but that's a really bad day
it's a twice a bad day because as I was
telling them that I would you know treat
them right and everything there were
some others were actually robbing the
storeroom of all the electronics
as I was talking to the staff they were
robbing they were actually robbing the
restaurant
well that that showed me anyway that was
pretty expensive
um
musk met with some civil rights leaders
the Anti-Defamation League and and NAACP
and I saw an interview by uh head of the
NAACP Derek Johnson
now interestingly uh the head of the
NAACP uh appears to be and I don't want
to I don't want to make an assumption
here but appears to be a black man
I know it's a weird thing about 2022
when I find out that the head of the
NAACP is at least apparently black
so
good job good job there seems like a
good fit
but I would like to give him a shout out
because you know how you get an
immediate reaction to some public
figures
do you remember when uh maybe you don't
remember it but when Barack Obama burst
on the scene the first time you saw him
give a speech
even if you were a Republican
you probably said to yourself ooh
there's something special there right
didn't you see that like you see it
immediately and the special thing was he
wasn't doing the thing you expect
Obama did not run as a black guy
and every time he didn't run as a black
guy which he did better than anybody
ever did right the Obama was just the
master of using race without using it oh
my God he did that well
because it was there you could see it
you can make your own decision but if
he'd even said it once you should vote
for me because I'm black he would be
done
it was like that's no no that's that's
absolutely you're you're off the list if
you say that but he never did because
he's very good at this stuff so I want
to give the like a similar shout out to
this Derek Johnson I'd never seen him
before but he was uh talking about the
meeting and he first said that he
thought musk agreed with the people who
were there
that's good so no no confrontational
anything just it looks like he agreed
but there was a question of whether musk
would be able to execute
which is exactly the the best question
you could ever have
do you think musk can execute
that's like what he does better than
anybody who's ever done anything it must
can execute yeah better than anybody
maybe in the whole world who's ever done
anything there's one thing you can do
but here's here's why I want to give
Derek a shout out he went through the
whole interview
and he talked about how he wanted to
make sure that you know Twitter was
protecting communities that you know
were marginalized
and
I watched the whole interview and not
once
did he frame things racially
now I think it's completely fair to say
don't don't have groups targeted for
hate speech that's not really a racial
statement that's something everybody
would say but somehow he got through the
whole thing without me hating him for
saying I'm bad or something
like I didn't get blamed for anything
and he didn't even talk about it like
in the normal uh team play
somehow he did it he did an Obama on
this thing and I gotta say I want to see
more I want to see more from him
Derek Johnson because one of the things
I've been saying forever is that the
Black American population doesn't have a
good leader
you know somebody who would appeal to
whoever they're trying to persuade at
the same time
as appeal to the black community
and he may he may be the guy
he's got he's got a strong strong game
yeah
so just keep an eye on him this is
another thing that in my opinion is
going right
in my opinion and this will be really
controversial racial
um racial what would you say
Harmony is actually improving
what do you think of that
in my opinion racial Harmony is
improving and I'll tell you why because
we're wising up to why it happened in
the first place we're wising up that it
was the media that was causing it right
and I think people are wising up the
people everybody wants everybody to do
well
if there's one thing that you can say
about Republicans
that you could just take to the bank
they want everybody to do well
right
there are no Republicans who want black
people not to do well they all want them
to do well as well as everybody who's
struggling they don't want to
necessarily be the ones that pay for it
that's a different question but they
want everybody to do well and would even
jump in and help
quite a bit if there was something that
made sense to help on and and the I
think that the education question is
where everybody's going to meet
because you know a black parent and a
white parent when they're talking about
educating their kids same page
I mean small differences but the same
page right everybody's got individual
differences
somebody says I don't think about race
unless I'm in social media
isn't that true
when was the last time you had a real
world
racial
anything
can't even think of one now I live in a
a pretty harmonious place in the country
but when was the last time you had a
racial confrontation
or even a racial issue
I don't remember the last time it like
it's literally not on my consciousness
anytime except social media you're right
yeah this is a social media thing
um so this is the this is weird and
wonderful and mind-blowing
that there was an accusation on Twitter
that Twitter had sold uh somebody a blue
check for fifteen thousand dollars and
that there was a system sort of an
underground system where people could
get to some Twitter employee who would
illegally I don't know if it's illegal
but I would offer to sell them blue
check you know outside of the normal
system
and apparently a number of people took
advantage of it I don't know what that
number is but here's the funny part
Elon Musk confirmed it
he goes yup
he said Yup
absolutely confirmed that Twitter had
been selling blue checks
does that does that just blow your mind
because and it blows my mind on several
levels
watching Elon Musk fact check the world
in real time is something we've never
seen before
like even if a politician gets fact
checked you have to wait until they give
a speech
right or wait until the statement comes
out of something but musk will be on
Twitter there'll be something that's
just like a complete lie or in this case
something that's weird but true and they
just fact checks it
you got like a five minute fact check
that you could actually believe
right if if musk says that happened I
believe it I mean why would he say that
of all things you could say you know
nobody's gonna lie about that
ah
for fifteen thousand you will cook
dinner well okay would be a good dinner
uh let's talk about some more Twitter
stuff the most important thing that's
happening lately
um Mark Ruffalo
uh one of the smartest Democrats now I'm
just joking he's one of the dumbest
uh if you were trying to if you tried to
list the dumbest celebrities who are
political
you know you'd put at least politically
dumb I'm not saying they're dumb like
low IQ but Mark Ruffalo
uh while I love his passion
and I love that he apparently cares
about the country and people and wants
good things for all of us so character
wise I'm a big fan
right yeah I think you have to
appreciate when somebody's on the other
side from you
if they're if they're trying to make
things better but they have a different
opinion now you can't really hate them
for that right you just want a different
thing but uh Mark Ruffalo uh tweeted at
musk he says Elon period please for the
love of decency get off Twitter
get off Twitter hand the keys over to
someone who does this as an actual job
and get on with running Tesla and SpaceX
you are destroying your credibility it's
just not a good look
is that the worst take you've ever seen
in your life
have you ever seen a worst take
this is an actor
who's giving
the most successful entrepreneur
of all time business advice
yeah
and he does it in public like that
should look good and he's worried that
uh Elon said he's saying that it's not a
good look for Elon do you know it's not
a good look
giving business advice to Elon Musk
my God man
my God
let me let me give you the Hollywood
analogy
that uh even Mark Ruffalo would this
would hit him hard all right you might
not know this but in the acting world
I made this mistake once uh when I was
working on the Dilbert TV show well I'll
tell you what what mistake I made one of
the voice actors was running through
some lines for the dilber animated TV
show that ran years ago and I didn't
like what one of the actors
um how how they played a line I'd
written the line so I knew how I wanted
it read so I I stopped and said oh you
know I want it done this way and I did
an impression
of the actor or actress doing the line
and I said do it like this then gave an
impression
my co-executive producer turned off the
mic
and invited me into the hallway
where I learned that I just committed
the greatest sin the greatest sin
let me tell you if you're ever in this
situation
don't tell an actor how to act
don't do that
here's what you do do can you give me a
different look can you give me a
different take you could say can you
combine a little uh like let's say more
concern you say I can't do that but like
add like you're more concerned as well
you can describe it
but do not do the imitation do not do
that that's that's like the big thing
you don't do now
to the credit of the actor or actress
who will remain nameless they didn't
give me a hard time about it but it's
because they also saw the car executive
producer drag me into the hallway
so that they knew exactly what happened
and I'm sure that they were they were
fine with it which by the way was good
executive co-executive producing so let
me give my compliments to my you know
co-executive producer Larry Charles
yeah Larry just dragged me into the
hallway and said um nope nope don't do
that again
so that was a good lesson now
that feels to me exactly like an actor
giving Elon Musk business advice
am I right
that's the same thing
you don't do that you don't do that well
if you do it at least add a little bit
of humility
right because I think we're all giving
Elon Musk some business advice but
usually it's in the form of our own
preferences you know it's not in the
form of what's good business now what
about the advice that uh
he's got these two other CEO jobs or
three or four how many other many
businesses you should stick to those
if you tell Elon Musk of all people in
the world
so you know seven point whatever a
billion people in the world
there's exactly one person who's the
wrong person to stay stay in your lane
he's the most wrong person out of all
seven billion of us that you should
advise not to leave his Lane
leaving his Lane is what he does best
is what he does best
better than anybody's ever done it
probably more consistently
so uh everything about that take was bad
what did musk and
um
ruffalo's comment was because Elon was
responding to AOC that AOC had made some
claims about uh musk messing with her
Twitter feed which didn't happen of
course and then musk replies hot take
not everything AOC says is 100 accurate
I love the understatement hot take not
everything AOC says is 100 accurate
all right here's the most exciting part
or dangerous part or something musk is
continuing to design Twitter or redesign
it in public
this is great you're getting a a total
business education and watching him do
this in public
you see it all so here's a tweet today
he was talking about how
um
he wants Twitter to be able to monetize
all Creator content
all Creator content
so Twitter would monetize much the way
um YouTube would I imagine
that any any content you know you could
share the revenue with Twitter so I
think that's where he's having
and that includes video now Twitter has
some video limitations you know resource
limitations but apparently according to
musk we can do he says we Twitter can do
42 minute chunks at 1080 resolution now
if you're in the blue the blue program
within Twitter
so you could break that up into longer
videos the 42 minute limit could be
fixed by next month and so he's telling
you that they're removing the 42 minute
limit
within a month which is super fast for
something of that magnitude
um
and then he finishes this is with this
question he says to the public how does
YouTube monetization work and what could
Twitter do better
talk about the transparency the
transparency there is insane
so he's telling you that he doesn't have
a sufficient like user level
understanding of what YouTube does for
creators
which is quite an admission in public
especially for somebody who's running
this company and that he's asking for
your input
and it's legitimate uh he's actually
asking for your input it's real like
it's not it's not for appearance
your actual input will determine at
least it could what Twitter becomes and
Twitter could be one of the most
important parts of society
and you you get to be part of it
so look at all the things you're
learning number one did he prove that
you don't need a marketing department
all the time
yes he did
yes he did so that's like a whole lesson
in itself you just replace the marketing
department
um he's also showing you the new CEO
move I talk about all the time which is
immediately establishing what you're
about like on day one
because that first impression becomes
really sticky that's that's who you are
forever you did that perfectly
and now you're seeing him collecting
um input from the customers in a very
direct way
and he's doing two things here you might
see one but he's doing two
the first thing he's doing is making
sure he gets input
um so he's got input
and the second thing he's doing is
making you feel buy-in
how much do you feel like you you're
legitimately part of the process or
better
people that you trust on Twitter you see
them making suggestions right and
they're smart people in many cases when
you see smart people on Twitter making
Smart Suggestions to Musk
even though it's not your suggestion you
feel like you're part of the process
right because you could have you could
have made that suggestion
so bringing the knowing that he has this
huge public relations problem because
half of the world is going to hate him
no matter what he does
now now the news is reporting he's he's
meeting with the NAACP
and the ADL
and that apparently they like him
imagine that that's the news he managed
the news the news is telling you that
the the groups that would be most
concerned got a good result good good
response from
he's doing everything right so you're
learning publicity marketing you're
learning how to take user requirements
you're learning how to get buy-in
you're learning how to communicate
you're learning how to tweet you're
learning social media as it relates to a
company you're you're seeing his
business model being created in real
time so he's struggling between
subscription and Advertiser and what
balance and what features
oh my God
oh my God is this useful
you don't realize how much smarter we're
all getting just by you know getting to
see the transparency of this this
process
so the the Brilliance that is coming out
of all of this is just stunning
cernovich Mike cernovich had an
interesting note on that tweet
he said that it's not being treated as
newsworthy that Twitter had entire teams
that coordinated messaging with the UN
says it all
um and he goes on and it says how is
that not a big deal he speculates he
goes exactly New York Times Washington
Post probably has the same internals
team doing propaganda
so sort of which is speculating that the
major media might not be hitting this
story hard because they might also have
deep connections at Twitter
which was you know managing the news if
you will
and I don't know if that's true it's
it's reasonable speculation
but
um I'm more interested in the fact of
why we decide some things are news and
some are not have I told you before that
the New York Times
and Washington Post
and and really not much else
a few others they make news
and by make news I mean they look into
all the things that are happening and
then they tell you what things are
important
but is it because they are important
that's what I used to think
I used to think that if it's on the news
it's because it's important
and everybody notices it and then
everybody puts it on the news nothing
like that is happening when it comes to
politics
they decide what the news is it's
literally just a decision by people who
you know want to manage the public
and they've decided that this is not a
big story
that Twitter was
you know being influenced directly and
personally and in an ongoing way by the
United Nations to make sure the
messaging was compatible with what the
UN wanted
which is the scariest thing you could
ever hear
now why is that not a big story
because the media decided it wasn't
I suppose Fox News could decide and
they're big enough that they could make
that a story but it would never cross
over from Fox News would it except that
other people would you know mock them
for having the only stories about it or
something
this is one of those cases where you can
tell yourself you really see
that the media assigns your opinion
because whatever your worked up about
today I guarantee it was on the news
and the things you're not worked up
about they were not on the news
the news decided what to run and they
they could pick or ignore whatever they
wanted
and then you get worked up over it and
you think oh I'm worked up over that
important thing no you're not worked up
over the important thing you're worked
up over what the news wanted you to be
worked up over
you're completely manipulated
as am I right I'm not
I'm not outside that system I'm just as
manipulated as you are just be aware of
it
and so that's a um that was a two-level
excellent tweet by cernovich because it
really gets to something deeper than
just the news
all right
um Tim Ryan running for Ohio senate had
to
have this statement to say in public he
said imagine his this is his competitor
he says imagine if JD Vance was your
teenage kid and you caught him hanging
around with people like Marjorie Taylor
green Ron DeSantis and Alex Jones
uh
to which I tweeted
imagine being a Democrat candidate I
said one day before election day because
I didn't know what day it was uh and the
best argument you have is that your
opponent values diversity
that's his argument my opponent
values diverse people because here's
what he didn't say
he didn't say JD Vance refuses to meet
with black people
you didn't say that
because I assume that JD Vance has met
with all of his constituents
but he's also also meeting with some
people who have opinions that Tim Ryan
does not share
so he's actually criticizing I mean this
is how empty this is how empty their
entire approach is the Democrats they
are so empty
that this close to election a strong
approach is that JD Vance values diverse
opinions
because that's what I heard
I didn't hear I didn't hear JD Vance
agrees with uh Marjorie Taylor green on
all things did you hear that nobody's
even claiming that what I didn't hear is
um JD Vance agrees with all the things
that Alex Jones has said
I've never heard of that because I'm
sure he doesn't
right if you're interacting with people
who have different opinions but not
adopting them
you're doing what we want you to do are
you
do you want to do you want a politician
who doesn't interact with people who
have different opinions
I mean this is the craziest weakest
emptiest attack I've ever seen But even
more than that I'm going a little hard
on it because
um
about once a year or maybe twice a year
I have to say this in public
and so I'm going to say it again
I assert
my complete right to associate with
anybody I want
and when you don't like it you
and that's the end of the conversation
I'm not going to adopt the views of any
bad people necessarily it might but
that's not why that happens
I I interact with people you don't like
and if you don't like that
 you
and there's nothing else to say would
you agree there's nothing else to the
conversation
this is one of those conversations where
 you
that's the whole argument it's the whole
argument there's nothing else
I have no Nuance to add to that just
 you
that's it you I'm going to
associate with whoever I want whenever I
want right in front of you
don't care
um to make my point
watch me prove my point with a Segway
that was probably created in heaven it's
so amazing
um
Adam kinzinger is right about this
so there you go Adam kinzinger somebody
that I would not agree with normally but
I associate with his following comments
because if you don't like me associating
uh and agreeing with Adam kinzinger on a
specific policy you
 you
but I know you don't I don't know none
of you have that problem I'm sure but uh
here he is being right about something
apparently there's some aircraft that
the National Guard uses to track the
drug shipments and defense null in
particular and it's going to be retired
and I guess kinsiger is one of the few
people who actually can fly that plane
um I didn't realize he was in the
National Guard kinzinger is still in the
National Guard
yes all right credit to him so can we
say that without
can we give a full-throated
Patriot
now I I hate what he did with January 6
right
but he's a member of the National Guard
and he's calling out a a huge problem
that this uh aircraft will be retired
and then they won't be able to easily
you know introdite interdict
um Fentanyl
so good job Adam kinsiger on this
particular issue which also suggests
that the administration is not that
serious about a fentanyl
because this plane is critical to their
success of capturing stuff
and uh kinsiger's fighting to keep this
funded so good for you hope you hope
that works
um let's talk about Trump
Trump labeled Governor DeSantis with a
nickname
he called him Ron de sanctimonious
how many of you had to uh
Look up the word sanctimonious
I did I did
yeah I did
so if it makes it any easier for you to
admit it I am a professional writer I do
it for a living
I never use that word
yeah so I had to look it up so in case
you don't know what it means like me
um basically somebody who's showing a
big show of religion or piety you know
being the right person but being someone
what hypocritical
so somebody who's trying yeah who was
trying to be holier than you but they're
sort of a hypocrite
does any of that seem to fit wrong
DeSantis
does that does that feel like a kill
shot
it does not
now how many of you were happy that he
said that
how many of you said oh I'm glad he did
that
not none right zero
so given given that none of you were
happy with that almost not of you let's
say 95 percent
if you were not happy with it wasn't a
mistake
yeah you weren't happy with it but was
it a mistake go
yeah it gets a little more complicated
now
let me hark back to my uh Mark Ruffalo
comment
Mark Ruffalo is not the one who should
be commenting on business stuff right
that's not his domain and so we should
all be humble
when we're commenting on somebody else's
expertise which we don't share
now I always have a little concern when
I criticize Trump for any of his
persuasion related stuff
because he became president
I didn't
whatever he does seems to work even when
you think he won't right that's probably
the most uh remarkable thing about his
method is that even people who support
him think that's not going to work well
that's not going to work and then
weirdly it works for reasons that you
don't imagine he sucks all the energy
out you know whatever
here's what I thought my first
impression was oh that's a mistake
that's a mistake he just went after one
of the most popular
Republicans was 100 successful according
to Republicans
so on the surface it's a mistake wasn't
it
but
did you notice it was the worst Kill
Shot he's ever issued
is that an accident
is it an accident that the kill shot
he used against DeSantis seemed to be
designed not to wound it
right it looked like a warning shot
over the bow exactly that was a brush
back pinch
the brush back pitch he just told the
world you can you can run against me in
the primary
but it's not going to be pretty
that's once you think about it a little
bit you realize it was just a brush
pitch it wasn't really about DeSantis at
all
you know I'd be surprised if he thinks
DeSantis you know does a poor job I
think he probably thinks DeSantis does a
good job he's also quite aware
that people are saying hey why shouldn't
DeSantis have the top job right so Trump
knows he has to knock DeSantis down a
notch but I think he was just telling
the world he's willing to do it
which is actually useful he's basically
saying yeah I'm not going to leave him
alone I'm going to go after him but he
went after me so softly
that it's easy to pull back right it was
such a soft brushback that that makes it
look like it was an intentional just a
warning shot just just to let you know
that you know he's the big shark and if
you go swimming with the big shark
you're gonna get bit
so I started hating it
and then the more I like the more I
thought about it it's like oh God he did
it again
you did it again he did something that I
immediately disliked but the more I
thought about it's like shoot that does
move the energy in his Direction in just
just a slight way
anyway
so always be humble when you're looking
at Trump's persuasion because you never
know exactly what he's up to sometimes
it's smarter than you think
all right
as we head into the midterms
how's everybody feeling
how is everybody feeling what do you
think about the economy
I think the economy will be right be all
right
yeah a lot of you are feeling uh
feeling good but also nervous I don't
know what's going to happen
but I'll tell you one thing that might
happen
one thing that might happen is there
there's tons of scrutiny and maybe we
got way better at watching things
so we might have the cleanest selection
we've ever had
like that's possible Right could be the
cleanest one we've ever had just because
of so much uh extra energy watching
things and there have been some changes
there have been some changes that should
reduce the amount of cheating
potentially
but the other possibility
that I don't discount at all is that the
extra attention will end up finding some
real
serious fraud it could be on either side
I'm not going to say it's going to be
all Democrat
because here's my opinion
the reason that we don't have uh
elections that can be finished the same
day
is because we don't want it
there's no other reason
we obviously we meaning both Democrats
and Republicans
you know each of them having control
over individual states it's very obvious
that they want the option of cheating
it's very obvious because if either side
didn't want the option of cheating they
would just make they would make the
option go away in their state
because there are places where the
Republicans can design the system any
way they want
right right to give me a fact check
there are states where the Republicans
could have a an Israeli type of system
where it's all on paper
and it all happens in one room the
ballots never leave the room you count
them in the room with lots of witnesses
and that there's basically close to zero
chance of fraud
you don't think that one Republican
state would have implemented something
that's
just fraud free
no it's because everybody who controls
elections in their own State wants the
option of gaming the system
what else could it be
what else could it be if either side
wanted the elections to be you know
transparent and done on the first day we
have we have models to follow that are
simple
they're simple just what does Israel do
and what does some other countries do
and just do that it works
so you you can eliminate the possibility
that either side wants to fix this
does anybody disagree with that
I'm not saying Republicans do anything
except you know dick around the edges
you know with voter ID and stuff which
is important but that's just sticking
around the edges
um
all right let me make a case that
everything's getting better even though
we're low on
diesel fuel
let me make a diesel fuel prediction are
you ready
so apparently if diesel fuel is limited
Trucking will
fall off and you know the supply chain
will die
and we don't have an obvious way to make
enough to fix that
I think we know about this problem far
enough in advance
that
um that we'll get through it like our
other problems so if we know far enough
in advance we we yeah trains and
everything else we're going to need to
uh
we'll probably make the adjustments
now imagine if you will that
the country just couldn't get products
where it wanted because there's not
enough diesel what would be the fallback
somebody Builds an app where you can all
be Uber for packages
right all it would take is an app that
says well just you know take your van
down to this dock we'll load you up with
stuff and you you know deliver to here
and you'll you'll be covered with some
temporary insurance or something like
that you know if it were a National
Emergency where people were starving and
stuff we would just use regular cars and
regular trucks just people would put
their bring their pickup truck and say
well I could deliver some of this
so it's one of those emergencies
where if you had to like you're actually
starving and
we have other vehicles right we're not
we don't have a shortage of vehicles
that can transport stuff it would be an
organizational you know Dunkirk sized
thing but we could do it
we'll get through it
all right
um is there anything that's going wrong
I'm not even entirely sure that Ukraine
is going wrong
yeah
are you
and I don't even know what wrong looks
like
because we don't know how it ends but
one potential ending is that Putin is
weakened and Russia is no longer a thorn
in our side and Ukraine is creating
energy and food for everybody it's
possible
uh the you know we're gonna have a huge
bill to pay in terms of our borrowing to
fund that war but
yeah if you're gonna if you're gonna
guess
it does look like things are pretty bad
over there and will stay that way and
could turn into a nuclear war but I will
see it happening I I feel like the
signals of a potential nuclear war would
be much stronger than they are so now it
just looks like people bluffing each
other so I I don't I don't spend really
any time worrying about nuclear war
right I mean that could change but at
the moment it just looks like bluffing
all right
um and then I I hear other people say
the real problem is uh that Russia and
China and other countries will have
their own currency and then America's
you know currency dominance will fall
away the dollar won't be worth something
but I feel like we've been talking about
that forever haven't we
yeah it just feels like we've been
talking about that forever I don't know
if that means it's about ready to happen
but I I feel like that's another one of
those Adam's love slow-moving disasters
there's probably a way around it
uh can we get reparations from China for
covet
well have you heard the story
that Russia has put together a case that
the virus escaped from a Ukrainian lab
that America backed
and they've asked the U.N to investigate
it and they've given a bunch of
information
have you heard of that
now how many of you would say there's no
chance that America was behind the virus
in the comments how many of you think
there's no chance there's no chance that
America was behind the virus
yeah you're a little a little uncertain
aren't you
yep in my opinion
it's entirely possible
entirely possible I'm not even sure how
I would put the odds on it I would say
the odds that we have accurate
information about the the source of the
virus is probably low
probably low
now obviously the Wuhan you know lab
looks like the obvious place but I'd
have to hear what I'd like to hear what
the Russians say because if America
released that virus and knew it
what would they do
if America knew it released the virus it
was already out there
and it knew you know nobody noticed it
yet but it's percolating and they know
it's going to percolate up
the first thing you do is you go infect
some people next to the Wuhan uh
lab
that's that's what you do you go infect
some people in Wuhan
because then when it breaks down Wuhan
everybody's gonna say
right so if you tell me that the the
odds are like all pointing toward Wuhan
being the source I would say not so much
they're definitely strong signals but we
live in a world in which that's the sort
of thing that gets faked like it's in
the category of things that people do
lie about every time like every time
whoever's country it was that released
that virus or whoever was responsible
don't you think you could rely on them
lying
so you know somebody's lying and you
just don't know
yeah Russia's been saying it since
February right
uh do prices return to previous levels
when inflation comes back down
that's not exactly how that works
no the answer is no
what should happen is your um your
paycheck should rise at some point if
you're working for the right company
your paycheck should rise to to meet
that
um but I don't know if that's going to
happen
yeah pangolins have been maligned
do you remember when we were hearing the
early theories about the virus and
people were so confident about it the
theories that turned out to be wrong
oh definitely came from that wet Market
oh definitely oh wet Market nope
your coffee cup somebody got their
coffee with Scott Adams coffee cup wall
on live streaming
amazing
um
somebody asked me at uh an event
yesterday well actually lots lots of
people asked me this they asked me if I
if I'm retired
because I guess I guess I'm at that age
where people just look at you and say
how's retirement like do I look
that old well I think that's that's the
first question you're going to ask me is
if I'm a retired I don't like that
um but I decided that I I am retired
but I'm modern and retired
by modern retired I mean I've simply
stopped doing the things I found
unpleasant that I did for money and I do
the things that I find Pleasant
it still work I was adding up how many
hours per week I work now in my
retirement
uh it's about 40 hours a week so my
retirement is 40 hours a week of work
okay which feels like retirement because
you know 16 and 70 would be more normal
but 40 feels like vacation like I'm
usually done by you know if I start at
4am
and I work seven days a week
right
I'm done by 10 a.m and I've done 40
hours a week 42.
and that's just on the live stream
right because I do a lot of prep for
that
um so I'm still doing the cartoon but my
assistant
is doing all of the drawing now
so if you see any differences in the
drawing it's because a better artist is
doing it
so my uh my my assistant who does the
art now is authorized to
change the the look of it a little bit
like the background add a little
backgrounds and maybe some angles that I
don't do just because she's a better a
better artist than I am
all right
um I need a time clock
because I've run too long
okay interesting message here
uh
all right I got a funny message but I
can't share it with you
um
Sharon says Scott with all caps do you
feel guilty for falling for the fear
hysteria of covid would anybody like to
answer Sharon for me this is in all caps
Scott do you feel guilty for falling for
the fear hysteria of covet
huh
I wonder what's going to happen to poor
Sharon
this is the sort of situation where
in the past
people have seen me
have a reaction
except
I don't believe she's real
I think she's just uh goading me so I'm
not going to respond to that
but Sharon
I'm sure there's somebody in the
comments who will share with you the
word that you have identified yourself
as and I don't need to use it
uh so Sharon you dug your own
situation
I don't want to say gray if that sounded
violent
yeah uh I think she's just kidding
around I don't think that's real
I've blocked her
I didn't block her
all right is there anything I missed any
stories I missed that you need a
reaction to wake up Scott
uh check out this jingle for the
simultaneous sip send that to me
somewhere else so I can see it I won't
won't be able to go back in the comments
easily
um
baby troll what's that means
you're still feeling better yes yeah so
let me continue with my update
um I have had nothing but excellent days
all day long
from the day that I stopped taking my
blood pressure meds nothing but
excellent days mentally 100 percent
100 physically
uh my knees are hurting a little bit
from overuse but otherwise my body is
you know it's like 20 years younger yeah
I mean I
I can exercise for hours it's just
everything's fixed and it was just that
yeah I forget what kind I don't think I
had a beta blocker I think I said it was
a beta blocker and then somebody
corrected me so I'm not going to name
the specific Med because I don't want to
get sued for making claims that they can
debunk or something
all right
it was a steroid I don't think it was it
wasn't a steroid
your coffee mugs will be arriving soon
thank you Henry
uh
High BP will Jack your cognition Jack
your cognition as an improvement
so did I tell you my reframe for blood
pressure
now I don't think this has scientific
backing so this is like just a fun
speculative thing right
um
is it is it a coincidence that all the
things that are good for blood pressure
um
are things that manage your energy
right but basically if you can lower
your energy or expend your energy so you
can expend it by exercise or you can
lower it by meditation for example
so it seems to be and this is just the
hypothesis that as you age your body
does not naturally off gas your energy
meaning that if you're a child and you
have high energy nothing will stop you
from moving right you'll just get real
active until you burn off your energy
and like fall asleep into a dead sleep
if you're an adult just because
um a normal adult lifestyle doesn't
involve moving much depending on your
job but you sit in the chair a lot oh
and I don't I like miss my workout or
something like that so I feel as if high
blood pressure
is really energy
that doesn't have a way to get out
does that reframe make sense to you
because it also tells you what to do
it tells you if you keep your body
healthy enough that you can exercise
then you've got you know good chance of
managing your blood pressure
yeah follow the energy exactly
follow the energy
Dr Oz has entered the room
yeah so I'm not going to say that uh you
should take that reframe and ignore your
doctors I'm just saying that it so
clearly explains everything that you
need to do and not do
just by energy and and there are a whole
bunch of things in which if you reframe
it as energy
you start understanding it remember when
I first reframed Trump as energy
like you were thinking in terms of fact
checking and policies but when I
reframed it in terms of he's an energy
monster and he moves the energy where
you want it then suddenly everything
makes sense right all the things are a
little confusing this suddenly comes
into focus when energy is the frame
I feel like this might be another one of
those
we'll see
oh I just realized I did something
clever
if I have a stroke because everybody's
teasing me because you know I got
vaccinated originally uh people saying
I'm gonna get a stroke but now that I've
publicly gone off my blood pressure meds
if I have a stroke
you're not going to know why
I've ruined your fun
I'm sorry
now if I have a stroke
it's because I'm off my blood pressure
meds
so I've ruined your anecdotal happiness
should I have a tragic event
your anecdotal happiness will be way
down Claude Adams will not be as funny
it won't be funny people won't laugh at
it
yeah
so that was accidental but it was a
stroke of Genius a stroke of Genius
exactly
uh
okay
no one here wants you to be harmed
probably no one here but there are
definitely some people who would have
mocked me my dead bones if I died
definitely
and I don't begrudge them they're fun
you know from Dad what's the difference
all right
could you have lowered the dose yes
and the lower dose did not affect my
blood pressure
so it didn't help it was actually raised
recently because it wasn't changing the
blood pressure
um
and by the way I I'm not the person
telling you you shouldn't take blood
pressure meds because apparently there
are a bunch of them I tried one of them
two of them actually and the two of my
tried didn't give me a good result
that's all I know I don't know about the
other five or six or whatever
do I eat grapefruit no it's weird
what is your BP it ranges now without
blood pressure the week after it ranges
between perfect
120 over 80.
um and 140 over 90 something
in the afternoon usually
and as I said to my doctor I'm not aware
of any studies that say somebody with
even the high end of my blood pressure
should be on blood pressure meds which
is not to say I shouldn't be
I was simply challenging whether there's
any medical
scientific
backing for it and my doctor was not
willing to say there was
because I did enough research to know
there isn't
there isn't
it's it's another one of those big
Pharma things
right
now
I have to be really careful I'm not
saying that you shouldn't take blood
pressure meds I'm saying let me be very
careful about that that's between you
and your doctor
all right
what time do you suggest I take my first
bong rip today well I think you've
wasted a few minutes asking the question
so
no time like now
um
140 isn't necessarily High
yeah I I think that
so here's the question
if you have a stroke it's not just
because of your blood pressure correct
there you know a number of factors have
to be also true at the same time
uh like your
yeah you need some kind of a thing going
on now in my case I'm a vegetarian for
you know 40 years more recently a
pescetarian
uh my my body mass index is exactly
where it should be I'm like right in the
middle of the good range
I exercise daily
I don't drink alcohol or smoke uh
tobacco
and there are no uh Strokes in my family
background
no Strokes in my family background now
can somebody tell me that my blood
pressure at 140
is dangerous
it might be I'm not saying it isn't just
being real clear I just don't think
there's any evidence to show that me as
a specific individual with a specific
lifestyle
I just don't know here's what I think
I've always believed that my body runs
hot
runs hot
and what I mean by that is that when I
go to sleep I wake up sweating
right like my natural body just runs hot
I'd rather be in a cool room than a warm
room I can't do work over 76 degrees if
the room is over 76. you know I my body
just runs up now you've also noticed
that when you do a lot of thinking
you notice you can break a sweat just
thinking hard has anybody ever done that
yeah your brain actually uses a lot of
energy
so I have a theory
that
um my my brain draws more from my body
than other people could it could have to
do with something about my physical size
compared to my brain size because I
think I'm not sure about this but I
think my brain size
is about the same as any adult male
right even if I'm if I'm five eight
isn't my brain about the same as a six
foot four guy can somebody is that true
somebody says no
and maybe it's not the it's the wrinkles
not the weight right all right well
whatever so forget about that point
because I don't have any backing for
that point but I feel as though my brain
draws more from my body than most people
because I just feel like I run hot
and I don't know that that's bad for me
right
I don't think it's bad for me
that I run hot as long as my body is you
know I'm taking care of all the other
lifestyle things I feel like I could run
hot and be optimized
I don't know just just the theory
yeah somebody says that's not how it
works and I agree that that is
definitely not how it works but in a um
it's more of a metaphorical sense that I
say I run a hunt uh the the
safer way to say it is
um
do I have the same risk
at 140 blood pressure as somebody else
and I don't think so I just don't know
my my suspicion is I don't but that
could get me killed of course
all right uh that's all for now YouTube
I will talk to you tomorrow and of
course on
um on Election Day
