good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a finer moment in your life
and it's probably just going to get
better
and if you'd like to take it up to
levels that the simulation can only
imagine all you need is a cover a mug or
a glass of tanker jealous of Stein that
canteen jugular flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamines in the day the
thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
well big news and of uh California
there's some
proposed legislation to legalize
um psychedelics not all of them but
they're looking to legalize
uh silos ibenz Silo Sim so mushrooms
basically DMT mescaline including peyote
and what I never heard of ibogaine
ibogained
has anybody ever heard of that one
how could there be an awesome drug I
haven't heard of ibogaine
anyway the
politician who's proposing this is uh
Democrat named Scott weiner Scott weiner
now just clarification
Scott weiner is an entirely it's a
complete other person
some people think it's referring to one
of my body parts but no he's actually a
separate like a complete human with all
of his Parts his name is Scott weiner
I know it's confusing
it seems like it's about my wiener but
it's not that's actually his name he's a
real person
clarifying
so uh
I've been laughing about this for two
days does anybody follow on Twitter uh
Jake Shields who's a former UFC MMA
fighter
five-time world champion
does any anybody uh
anybody follow him all right so I don't
know the whole back story
all I saw was one one few tweets and a
video
but based on what I can understand
there's somebody named Mike Jackson
who must have been calling Jake Shields
a uh a Nazi
over social media so that's I'm
intuiting that's the concept here not
intuitive but
um and then the video shows
Jake shields on top of him in a gym
you know to totally subduing them while
people are trying to pull Jake off him
and then Jake just tweets this
I finally ran into the uh Mike
Jackson and then he says he quickly
discovered the difference between
calling people Nazis in person versus on
Twitter
he quickly discovered the difference
now
as I said when I retweeted it I disavow
all violence I'm I'm not in favor of
violence
but I can't help it when it's funny
I feel like that has to be called out
this is this is funny violence
some of the funniest violence you'll see
today
so totally against violence don't do any
violence but if you do funny violence
I'm very likely to tweet it
hurts we thread by uh Cabot Phillips
about male fertility saying that in the
last 50 years the average male sperm
count was dropped 62 percent
and testosterone rates are down over 30
percent
and then he says we know what's causing
the drop but a few leaders seem
interested in talking about it do we do
you think we know what's causing the
drop in uh testosterone
well when he says we I suppose he means
doctors of the medical community but I
feel like they might have left out a few
I feel like there's a few a few notes
short of a symphony
so let me tell you which things he
mentions I see your comments I'll tell
you which things he mentions has clearly
related all right
so male obesity would you agree male
obesity lowers your testosterone you all
knew that right and definitely uh
obesity is up okay
so we'll we'll accept that
um let's see there's also
um
uh what is it uh
oh forever chemicals
I've been hearing this phrase forever
chemicals some kinds of plastics and
other chemicals apparently just never
disintegrate
and it's getting into our bodies and
probably having some suppressive effect
on her fertility
so that's scary
all right so we've got the uh the manner
men are getting fat and uh there's more
anxiety
that sounds right doesn't it more
anxiety
so men with anxiety might produce less
sperm and have less testosterone
so those are three things the forever
chemicals and maybe just chemicals in
general
um obesity of the man and anxiety or
lowering their testosterone can you
think of
can you think of anything else
is there anything left off the list
for example
I saw somebody mention the fauci
fauci that was funny that's
ouchy
let's blame that guy for
everything
inflation
all right some of you are saying soy
and I don't know if that's
scientifically demonstrated
uh so I'm not going to say that the
science supports that I think I think
the science says
not that it lowers your testosterone
but doesn't it mimic some female
hormones is the claim
right I want to make sure I don't get
sued but the claim
is that it mimics female hormones not
that it
detracts from your testosterone
or is that necessarily always the same
I don't know the answer to that question
but but would you agree that it's it's
notably is notably missing
even if only to mention that you know
you would expect it to be mentioned
right
even if the mention was some people
think it's this but the science doesn't
quite support it
you'd think it'd be mentioned yeah The
Vaping vaping not mentioned but that
would be another example of chemicals
getting into you how about for
pharmaceuticals in general
I saw your comment earlier yeah
Pharmaceuticals in general
now the VA the vaccinations are largely
um
are largely
listen how do I say this best the
vaccinations happened well after the
trend
so that the trend was really solidly in
place
way before the vaccinations
now if the vaccinations made it worse I
don't think the data
could tell you one way or the other at
this point but maybe I mean who knows
what else I I want to see how far I can
get before the most obvious answer
appears to you
there's a way more obvious answer
and it's just hilarious that nobody
thinks of it because there's like a
magic trick going on the magic trick
is diverting you
and I I don't mean to be unkind in the
following thing I'm going to stick to
what I think is just factual
I'm not trying to make fun of anybody
right
they mentioned obese men
so men are getting fatter
do you think it makes any
difference that the women are getting
fatter too
because nobody doubts that right it's
not it's not just men getting fatter
the women are getting fatter too
and let me ask you this I ain't to be
brutal do you think men are going to
have as much of a testosterone
let's say response to a lesser
attractive woman
oh
well I don't know I'm no scientist but
I'm guessing
did you know that it that when a man
gets married his testosterone drops how
many of you knew that would you get
married your testosterone just below
why it's it's because presumably
your attraction to the woman you married
in just the normal reasons of life would
decrease
so you get you know married to the one
person who's
going to become less attractive over
time not for any fault of their own it
could be just you know age and
familiarity and all that stuff so
does anybody believe that men's
testosterone is unrelated
to female stimulation
am I am I too far into the
non-scientific or am I still
scientifically valid
that's that's well understood right that
if you put a man around attractive women
attractive to him again we won't make a
judgment call right so we're not doing
any fat shaming
everybody clear on that this is not fat
shaming this is just talking about
science right and and weight is big part
so
why is that left out
like how how can you leave that out
now let me tell you something I noticed
uh since I've recently transitioned no
not that way not that way
from being married
to not married
I can feel the testosterone difference
I can feel it
and that I said the other day that I
haven't had a bad day in two months
and now I know what it is my voice is
deeper my
um my muscle gain was instant
my my Feel My overall feeling of
well-being
like yesterday I was just
standing there
feeling good
I was literally just standing there in
my kitchen and I thought
my God I feel good
just that just all over
and and it was it took me a while to
figure out what it was now I'd been
doing everything right from you know
exercise to sleep to you know diet and
everything so I've been getting
everything right health-wise but I could
actually feel
the testosterone
being higher I mean I don't have any
doubt that is higher it just feels
higher like my whole
attitude of life the way I see
everything and the other way that you
can feel it is
I'm afraid of almost nothing
is there any men here who can back me up
on this what do you ever do you have the
feeling that you can tell your
testosterone is high
that might be just my impression
because I feel like I can tell
is because when you walk into a room you
either own it
or you're part of it
that's the difference
when your testosterone is high and you
walk into a round a room you own the
room
you just own it you know it you act like
it and everybody else can tell too
now that that parses my head I feel like
other people can tell
but when I walk into a room and my
chemistry is right
I just own the room
the and there's the room is helpless
like that's the way it feels right
that's just the impression
and other men saying the same thing
right
yeah and the the scariest part is that
you lose fear
because fear is actually pretty useful
right keeps you out of trouble and and
sometimes when my testosterone feels
High
I feel that I'm losing too much fear and
then I start to be concerned but not
afraid concerned that I'm Not Afraid
enough that I'm you know I'm in
dangerous territory it's a very male
thing I don't think women could quite
relate to it
who knows some of us in my head
all right how about some other things
how about uh just the way
the way men are treated in society
the value of a man at least in terms of
society's average opinion is way down
so men are losing
like they're losing at life
when you're losing a life
when you're losing a life your
testosterone goes lower and men are
losing at life because there are too
many of them and they're not getting
dates and they're not succeeding in
their careers all right somebody brought
up earlier how about masturbation
without checking
does it lower a man's testosterone
masturbation yes or no
seems obvious right the most obvious
thing is that masturbation would lower
your testosterone except that you're
wrong
Google it
I wasn't sure I just Googled it a minute
ago
according to Google's top answer you
know where they they sort of summarize
the answers no difference
no difference at all like there's no
statistical difference do you believe
that
you know you can definitely feel that it
lowers your energy
and maybe it feels like it lowers it
at some point in the process
but I would say I don't feel that it
lowers it overall
so I would say that uh
I would say that sex or that uh
orgasms in general don't lower your
testosterone except maybe some
short-term thing
it may be temporary right
so anyway this is a scientific bunk
New York Times magazine was writing a
story about tick tock
which suggests that the
the illegitimate press is finally
figured out that they better get on the
right side of the tick tock thing
because there's basically nobody on the
other side
literally nobody unless they're actually
just you know bought off
so
here's what they say 47 of likely U.S
voters believe that uh
uh oh wait has Biden Biden made the
country worse I got my uh
got my titles worth so this is Rasmussen
Rasmus has said 47 of the voters think
Biden has made things worse that's not
what I'm talking about I'm talking about
uh tick tock
so
here's how the New York Times magazine
talks about tick tock
dammit
they had a really good quote there that
I apparently wrote over with another
quote so you won't hear that but here is
the general point of it the general
point of it is the the New York Times uh
is trying to find a way
to describe Tick-Tock as you know not
the obvious worst thing in the world and
needs to be removed immediately
so listen to one of the ways that they
excuse the Biden Administration
the Biden Administration has been
negotiating with bite dance for a year
about you know how to how to handle the
tick tock situation
now is that the way you would have
characterized it
would you characterize a year has gone
by
with nothing happening well there's
a major uh security concern and no
argument on the other side
see the no argument on the other side
part is really important
why would it take a year
to negotiate something when there's
nothing to negotiate
there's nothing to negotiate you just
say
we ban you and then they're not in the
app stores and it's over there's nothing
to negotiate
the the fact that the New York Times has
to give cover to Biden and saying
they're negotiating for a year there's
no negotiating going on who thinks
that's real does anybody think they're
actually negotiating for a year
of course not that's the most ridiculous
lie I've ever seen
well maybe not the most ridiculous
so yeah we we have some real questions
there
um and we have to assume that the
government is corrupt because the tick
tock thing like I say it doesn't have an
argument on the other side and when you
see that we see them not able to act
when there's no argument
that's got to be corruption
right because even incompetence doesn't
explain it because it's just an
executive order
like it would be the easiest thing you
could ever do
like you don't even have to do work
Biden could just say write an executive
order
band Tick Tock I'm you know I'm the head
of the military so just go do it that
would be it
you know it couldn't be more obviously
corruption related
speaking of corruption
um the theme for the rest of this is uh
that the whole government has corrupt in
various ways and it occurred to me today
that if Trump takes the Crooked Hillary
um
concept and just applies it to the
entire FBI Department of Justice CIA and
if he just says look
I'm just going to fire the top several
layers of management in all of these
organizations
I don't even know which ones are good
and which ones are bad and I can't tell
but I'm going to get rid of two levels
of management from the top down in all
of these organizations I'm just going to
give them all a haircut
I'm just going to mow the lawn and I'm
sorry I don't know which ones are good
and which ones are bad and this will be
bad for the ones who are good and got
taken out but for the good of the
country these these organizations have
lost our trust we just have to mow the
lawn time to do maintenance it's just
basic maintenance it's like not personal
it's just you've gotta
you just gotta Shore up the Republic
now
what have I taught you is the best
most powerful form of persuasion
go
fear correct got it on the first try
fear
don't you think that the entire
government being corrupt
scares people
now I don't know if it scares people on
the left yet because they may they may
be getting such fake news that they
don't have no idea what's going on but
between the you know the concern about
the vaccinations
whether that whole thing was handled
honestly that the concern about the FBI
which has now gone beyond concern is
proof that they were working against the
legally elected government
you know that that's just now in
evidence and
I think Trump could make a case
that if he goes with draining the swamp
but nobody's going to listen to that
because he didn't do any draining the
swamp it has to be more specific I'm
going to fire two layers of all of these
organizations I'm just going to replace
all the management that's been there for
more than a year or something like that
anyway I think you could do that you're
the fellowing things that are uh oh and
I would also call it a tourniquet
strategy so imagine if Trump went after
all the corrupt organizations but also
in every rally he went through the
hoaxes that the country has suffered
because of the media right like there's
at least 20 of them that he could
mention he could throw in a new one in
every rally
all right here's my third rally hoax
number three
and there's just speak about the hoax
and then it becomes like a little news
bite and they just hit every hoax
until the news can summarize them I hear
all the hoaxes
that you know Trump has debunked
anyway the January 6 hoax committee I
call them a hoax because
I can't take the January 6 committee
seriously
um there are four things they have
recommended to the Department of Justice
their recommendations have no weight no
standing and no functional purpose
whatsoever because the Department of
Justice is already investigating
everything they care about
like they weren't waiting the Department
of Justice wasn't waiting for this
public information to be packaged up
like it doesn't have any it's just not a
part of any uh justice system process is
literally just for the news so they have
something to talk about and you know
propaganda so here are the four things
the question I want to ask you is
if you know what projection means
where you blame somebody of doing the
exact crime that you're doing
see if this sounds like projection
because the committee did seem like a
bunch of toxic narcissists and there
they project so just ask yourself if the
things that they're saying that Trump
did is there anything in the past few
years that you would say would apply to
the Democrats
for example number one obstruction of an
official proceeding
is there anything that any Democrats
have done in the past several years that
would look like obstruction of an
official proceeding
yes
Lots about conspiracy to defraud the U.S
I don't even know what that refers to
I watched this whole thing and I don't
know what that is what exactly would the
be the conspiracy to defraud something
the election
by by saying the election wasn't fair
according to him
all right have the Democrats ever done a
conspiracy to defraud the U.S
Russia collusion hoax
of course they have yeah the Democrats
run one conspiracy after another to
defraud the U.S it's Non-Stop
how about making a false statement
can you believe that
they want the Department of Justice
to prosecute Trump for making a false
statement
could you be more specific
you know could you be less specific
all the Democrats do is make false
statements yeah that's like shift's
entire job the the laptop you know was
disinformation it's all false statements
how about inciting and insurrection
who do you think incited the
insurrection
well I mean all of these are so
subjective
yeah the the FBI so to me
to me it looks like just projection
that's all I see now of course it'll
work because the the Democrats will
embrace it
now I saw a tweet from Greg price who
says uh the the person who made this
announcement in other words the four
charges against Trump was representative
Jamie Raskin who objected to the
certification of the 2016 election based
on the LIE that Russian that Russia
installed Trump as president
now knowing as you will that Jamie
Raskin is the one who read
the four charges
and knowing that he was personally
involved in
basically this crime
so did when Jamie Raskin objected to the
certification of the 2016 election based
on the LIE that Russia installed Trump
as president was he obstructing an
official proceeding
sort of
with a bunch of was he was it a
conspiracy to defraud the U.S that's
exactly what it was the Russian
collusion thing was a conspiracy Detroit
U.S was he making a false statement yes
and was he inciting an Insurrection he
was literally trying to overthrow the
government
like overtly
he said this government should be
overthrown because it's a Russian
whatever
now
could this be more obvious
you know I I'm somewhat uh Infamous for
saying that I didn't think projection
was necessarily even real I didn't think
it was
honestly but until you see the real
examples of it the it's hard to believe
like if you didn't see example after
example you wouldn't believe it on
concept you know the concept of it is
too ridiculous but there it is
there it is
this could not be a cleaner example than
projection and and the the Democrats are
buying it
all right so today I guess the house
Ways and Means Committee is going to
vote on releasing Trump's tax returns
has that happened yet
as the vote happened
probably not I would have heard about it
so uh what What's the dog not barking
do you hear the biggest dog in the world
not barking
like a really really big dog not barking
they
Congress has his tax returns
they've looked at them
they have nothing to complain about
apparently
apparently there's no crime there
don't you think if there were if there
were anything in the taxes do you think
it would have leaked
that's a you know that's not a real
question of course it would have leaked
a hundred percent chance that's one of
the things you don't have to wonder
about yeah right not one leak about his
taxes do you know what that means
It could only mean one thing there's
only one thing that means
there's nothing there
but what does it mean that they want to
release them
what is the second thing it means
it means that they know
that the press and the public are now
sophisticated at looking at tax returns
and that the president public will
generate unlimited stories of how what
bad problems they found
that are not real
they'll just take stuff out of context
right
so clearly the only reason they want to
release them is to embarrass Trump and
make him less electable
now if they're not claiming that there
are any crimes in there
and so far they're not
if they're not claiming there are any
crimes in there what should be the
response
to Congress releasing them
if there's no claim of impropriety and
they release them and they they take his
uh his uh privacy
well let me give you my opinion
it should be illegal
and it should be the death penalty
now it's not illegal so I'm not
recommending any violence or anything
like that I'm saying that if you were to
rate the the seriousness of it they are
taking down a president right in front
of you or trying to they're trying to
alter the the course of the Republic by
doing something that apparently doesn't
have a legal or
country benefit
and they're doing it right in front of
you and they're not even claiming
there's a crime in there
right in front of you
they're not doing it to Trump they're
doing it to you
because when this this if this standard
Falls
then anybody's taxes or fair game for
anybody
why wouldn't they release mine
they say hey this guy keeps saying
things we don't like let's release his
taxes we'll always stop them
is it because Trump's president and I'm
not
that's not a law is it is there some law
that says presidents have to release
their taxes no it's the opposite there's
no law there's no law so if they do it
anyway it was he's just a citizen whose
taxes got released because they thought
it was
what politically useful
of interest to the public
is that good enough
the public would be interested so I
guess they could show the public my tax
returns too right because the public
would be interested wouldn't they they
say oh he talks about politics I'd like
to see his taxes where does that stop
now I don't believe in the slippery
slope you know predicting everything
because it doesn't
but in terms of how bad this is
you know again without any specific
claim of illegality this is this is a 10
out of 10.
you're you're watching them
you know let's say digitally crucify
somebody just so he won't run for
president
that's all it is
and we're we're sitting here accepting
that like well I guess
they get I guess they followed the rules
unfucking believable
yeah and what about the whole revelation
of the the Twitter files so uh Michael
schellenberger did another you know
great Twitter thread yesterday and at
this point is very clear all the
evidence suggests that Jim Baker is the
key figure who went from you know top
legal position at the FBI to Twitter and
it's obvious that Twitter was trying to
control
um trying to they did a good job of of
influencing Twitter
they were even paying Twitter three
million dollars for Twitter answering
their questions now that that's not like
a big profit Center so I don't think
Twitter was
influenced by the money
like everybody's influenced by money but
that was actually a small amount and it
kind of just covered their expenses so I
don't think that was the motivation
it's it's truth they got money but I
don't think that it was too small to
motivate them
um
now we know at this point
that
the FBI was totally corrupt I'm going to
use corrupt in an expansive sense not
necessarily legal sense because I don't
know if they violate any laws but what
they did was a
a form of corruption
that as Jordan Peterson tweeted I think
yesterday is way worse than Watergate
and you hate to say that right
because it's such a punch line it's
worse than Oregon the walls are closed
in but it would be hard to argue this
one
it would be hard to debate
you know what we know for sure like the
things that are not in question at all
just the things we know for sure are way
worse than Watergate
it's not even in the same planet
am I wrong
well it's way worse
and what will what will happen from all
of it probably nothing
probably nobody will be punished
for anything
is my guess
um
all right
so
the former FBI general counsel
I think this was a was this Greenwald or
sheldberg who said this
now do you think it's a total lie
that Baker
believed it was still a question about
whether the laptop was real or not
because Baker was saying well you know
we can't tell for sure
whether the laptop is real
so I'm not saying it's not real but we
can't tell for sure
is that a lie
is it
is a lie that he couldn't tell for sure
how would he know
because at that point the FBI had not
validated it only the New York Post had
so as far as he knew
although it was
it could have been validated like the
the assets and the time to do it were
there
but they had not been
is that a lie
well I'd say it's a lawyer lie
it's a legal lie
like if you said do you really believe
that it hasn't been validated
I think he could get away with it in
court and say yes the only evidence I am
aware of was the New York Post I don't
consider them credible for whatever
reason and the FBI said they had not
verified it so what am I supposed to say
if the FBI says they don't know
what am I supposed to say
right so he does have a defense
I'm not sure I would call it a lie
but the odds that he knew exactly what
he was doing
seemed very high
can we agree can we agree that the the
odds that he knew exactly what he was
doing are very high
very very high
but he has a defense
um
and now we know that the Department of
Justice
was reading the emails of Devin Nunes
and cash Patel
what
during the actual
period of Devin Nunes trying to get to
the bottom of the Russia collusion hoax
the Department of Justice found a clever
excuse
to read his emails and cash
Patel on baby some other staffers
oh
my God
am I surprised now of course
but oh
my God
you could take any one of these stories
and this is worse than Watergate where
we're at like five times worse than
Watergate
five different ways
it's it's almost too much to even
and this is what I worry about if there
had been one like clean little scandal
than the you know the Republicans would
pounce on it and the media would have to
talk about it and maybe like something
would happen like Watergate Watergate
was pretty much one little story of the
break-in
and it was like a clean little story but
there is so much bad going on at the
same time that we're finding out about
so so much corruption that I wouldn't
know where to even focus
like I'm actually the was it the uh the
ooda loop what's that called the Udu
Loop
I'm saying it wrong
Cuda UDA the UDA Loop so basically if
you just keep
um being pushed by the new information
you can never deal with the information
that you had before in other words new
information is just pushing you forward
and you're like hey what about that
other thing uh okay on to the new thing
so as long as you just keep getting
pushed
by the new headlines you can't really
deal with
any of the individual Badness it's just
too big and too spread out and too
complicated
I think they get away with everything
that's what I think I think they will
get away with everything because they
know how to do it they know how to just
just make the the environment impossible
to to come after them
um all right here's another Scandal like
I I don't forget if I mentioned this I
think I did that the Biden
Administration said they created a
million jobs
right before the election
it was just a complete lie the real
number what rounds to zero
the difference between you know ten
thousand I think and a million
just a clear obvious clean lie do you
think it would have affected the
election to know that the jobs president
as he would like to call himself created
you know basically no jobs
unbelievable
unbelievable and I'm trying to think
what is anything that the Trump
Administration ever did that would be in
this class of Badness
like there's plenty of stuff you didn't
like
right there are things you didn't like
that Trump did but do they do anything
like this that just like is like obvious
corruption
well you know we'll never agree on on
the vaccination thing
but you have to you have to judge Trump
by what he knew at the time
so that's going to be tough because our
brains don't work that way you know
we're going to judge by what we know now
we're not going to judge him by what he
knew and what everybody knew at the time
that we simply don't have the ability to
do it like I love that we were smart
enough and wise enough and you know
mature enough to say well
he acted on what he knew at the time no
we're not as you as you can see the
comments we're definitely not
all right
um
so
here's what reality is done there are
two realities about the coveted shots
in one reality
um they were a huge success
but there's some question about whether
they make sense for younger people
especially men
so that's one movie
that maybe I don't know half of the
country has
I'm not saying what's true and what's
false I'm just saying what what their
reality is so the reality is that the
shots were a huge success they're glad
they got them saved millions of lives
but maybe but maybe because of Omicron
we should rethink younger people and
especially younger males
in the other movie
uh the shots were simply more harm than
good and that that has been so well
demonstrated that that's just true
that we already know without having to
wait any further we don't have to wait
for the future we already know
what the future looks like
and that we already know that there will
be more harm in the future than benefit
from the vaccinations now again I'm not
saying what's true or false I'm saying
that these two realities live completely
and and they're opposites right they
can't both be true
now would you agree that's that's our
current situation again not don't tell
me what's true or what's false is that
our current situation that we have two
realities
okay here's what here's what I'm going
to add to this it will never be resolved
do you know why
why will it never be resolved
into one reality
because that's not how anything works
here's why
as long as those two realities can
operate
they will as long as they can they will
and there's nothing that's going to
happen that will make them have to merge
now you say to yourself but Scott what
about that the new data that will come
in later
to which I say who's going to believe
data
you don't believe the data you had
why would you believe the new data so if
you can't prove it with science and data
because we just won't believe them
how would ever be resolved
now one way would be yes
one side predicts well and the other
doesn't
that that's a good sign of who's right
right if one with one world view
predicts and it just keeps getting the
predictions right well maybe that's the
good one right but what will the two
World Views predict
one world view will predict
that the vaccinations worked and there
won't be much trouble from the
vaccinations the other one says that
there'll be Mass problems from the
vaccinations and then which prediction
will be correct whose prediction will be
correct the mass problems or the hey it
worked out fine
in the future who will be predicted you
won't know both right they will both be
completely supported by the data
they can't both be true
can't both be true but they will be
completely supported by data that the
side that wants to believe it accepts
we're
now here's the interesting part is this
different
than the way it has always been for
other topics
do we always do we always Retreat into
two different worlds and we just live in
them and it never matters we just
forever are in
because remember we've been in the um
the the anti-vaccination
Two Worlds for a long time way before
covid
we already had two movies that lived
permanently and they were opposites
that the childhood vaccinations were bad
versus the childhood vaccinations were
unambiguously good and they lived they
lived completely as two realities
all right here's my take
neither of those realities are true
do you know why I say that
because none of the realities are true
everything you see is sort of like a
user interface for something you don't
understand
so when you use your computer
and you're you're you're punching an
icon
you see the icon but that's not what the
computer is the computer is zeros and
ones organized in ways you don't see and
don't understand right you're you're at
the user interface level that's a user
interface level you don't know if what's
behind it is uh Unix or Mac OS or
some windows thing right
if all you see is a screen because yeah
you can make a you can make a browser
look like anything
so I don't believe in a objective
reality
that we have access to there might be an
adjusted reality but I believe that
whether vaccine vaccinations work or
don't work is not a base reality
then neither of those are base reality
their base reality is just something you
don't understand
but as long as you can live a world
where internally everything is
consistent if you're in the world where
vaccinations are good or the world where
they're bad as long as you can live your
life and reproduce
that's all you need
it's all you need but neither of you are
right
you're you're just at the user interface
level so here's what you're arguing
you'll hear two buttons on the screen
you're saying No this is the button to
do the thing and the other person said
no this is the button to do the things
but you're only talking about buttons
you're not talking about anything in
base reality because we don't have
access to it
uh
time lapse charts here what's the truth
I want the truth you're never going to
get it a reality has forked
so I asked uh on Twitter I did a poll
and I said did you fall for the mass
Hysteria
generated by trolls that said I
personally was pro-vaccine and pro mask
and I'm going to give you a little test
of uh to see how good you are
predicting
roughly what percentage of the public
who answered the poll believed the met
the mass hysteria that I was pro-vaccine
and pro mask
very good very good guesses yeah about a
quarter
yeah roughly roughly 25 but about a
quarter yeah didn't see that coming
total surprise
when I when I ran the poll I could never
have anticipated that result
if you knew the live stream none of this
makes sense
but trust me
it's a very funny inside joke
all right
somebody called me a fence sitter on uh
vaccinations
the FED sitter
isn't that
very similar to somebody who's waiting
for enough information to have a good
decision
yeah could you be a is it bad to be a
fence sitter when the information is
nodded
what would be the smarter way to go
huh we don't really know what the future
holds therefore I'll be positive
if you're positive that you can
determine the future
I don't think the problem's on my end
I will defend my inability to discern
the future but you need to defend your
ability to discern the future because I
don't have that
so Kerry Lake's lawsuits I guess two of
her ten claims are going to go forward
one of them involving the printers
malfunctioning on Election Day and the
other involving the chain of custody for
some of the ballots
but do you have any hope that that will
change anything
I feel like all of these complaints of
corruption
they they get
slathered on the bureaucracy
and then the bureaucracy just squirms
around for a while and then nothing
happens
like I feel like
uh the court is where everything goes to
die
well if you want nothing happened take
it to court
you'll get a you'll get a nothing there
so I don't think anything's going to
happen from these
like I'm glad she's pressing the case
because wouldn't you like to know more
of course you would I'd like to know
more about this situation if a lawsuit's
the only way we can get to the you know
the next level of understanding then I'm
all for it but I wouldn't I wouldn't be
optimistic
not at all
right ladies and gentlemen
I believe we've covered
all the news it's fit to sip
that's my new that's that should be my
new tagline
all the News That's fit to sip and I
think that we need another sip
because
as this 2022 comes to a close
I feel like we're going to have to spend
some days on some uh
let's say aggressive positivity
what do you think I think I'm going to
start bending my presentation toward
gratitude
uh just so we could get a little dose of
dose of Christmas spirit
a little bit of uh appreciating each
other Maybe
a little less of the bad
and uh so I will be complimenting people
that
maybe I've disagreed with because I
think that's good practice
um I will uh be telling all of you how
much I appreciate you
now well let me do that now I mean I'm
sure I've done it before but you can't
get enough of it can you
um I think you kept me alive
like I think you just kept me alive
because I had some you know tough
medical stuff to go through this year
you know on top of personal stuff
um but oh my God I can't imagine going
through this year without this
experience
so being connected to you in this in
this way
um
is my fuel right
and
it also gives me something to look
forward to
when when I wake up in the morning
the first thing I think is oh boy I get
to do this
I don't know I'm not sure how other
podcasts feel about what they do
does Joe Rogan think it's work
or does he just still love it I hope he
loves it but I don't think of this as
work
like it doesn't feel even a little bit
workish and I put more energy into this
than anything else I do and none of it
feels like work and it's because because
of the interaction it's because there's
it feels like something important
it feels valuable it feels like it's
helping and and that's sort of connects
me to that connects me to my most basic
uh if you want to say evolutionary
my basic biological need is to be useful
and yeah I wish I could turn it off
if I could turn it off and not not need
to be useful I could I could have a
pretty good life just go spend my money
and said the beach or something I don't
I hear people like that but that's not
for me
like I just have to be useful or my day
doesn't work so that's why I do this
and it's fun
um
yeah and I do feel like I do feel like
we've formed some kind of mutual
responsibility accidentally I mean
certainly voluntary you know nobody's
making you do anything but
um I feel like at least based on the
comments people say that I've I've
helped some people this year
and wow if you help me you have helped
me so much I can't even can't even tell
you and let me tell you what that does
let me tell you what that does so as you
know I just finished a book that won't
be out until September but
um that book was written primarily for
you
meaning that you know my interaction
like surfaced that the reframes where I
reframe a topic so you just feel better
about it or it could be more effective
that that really made a difference
and so I put put a bunch of them in a
book and
um am I dying no I'm not dying uh I put
him put a bunch of them in a book and
mostly because I thought you would like
it like it in the sunset it'll be useful
so
all right
um
you know it's also weird
I feel myself getting healthier and
stronger every day
and that's not supposed to happen at my
age right
like I don't think it's true necessarily
but like I have a great feeling of
things improving
yeah well we love you too
um some of you are praying for me I
appreciate that
Mike malice recommends self-publishing
yeah it depends where you are in the
publishing World
um if you're an established writer
it probably makes sense to use a
publisher
if you're
successful but maybe not a household
name yet maybe that's different
better all the time that's right
well thank you you're saying nice things
uh yeah I'm not taking any blood
pressure meds
you know I have such basic questions
about science now
I I'm not even sure that high blood
pressure is bad for me
now please don't take any medical
advice for me don't take any medical
advice for me here I just have this open
question
I've always believed that I run hot
meaning that when I sleep when I wake up
I'm like covered with sweat right
and
I just feel I run hot like I'm just
overclocked I'm not sure that high blood
pressure for me specifically
predicts
now that could be the dumbest thing
anybody ever said and I'd be open to I'd
be open to correction right if Dr Drew
tells me tomorrow
Scott's got the the science is
unambiguous you know above some level
you're definitely in trouble now if I
hear that I will modify my opinion
but I don't trust any of the data
anymore like none of it
and
I feel as if uh if I do everything else
right
it's right like I'm not drinking I'm not
smoking tobacco uh you know my diet is
pretty clean if I'm doing everything
else right
is running a little high on uh on blood
pressure gonna give me a stroke
like can anybody know that
because I feel like they don't study me
am I right
like they didn't study me
any study they do is going to be like a
big group of people isn't it
am I right
now I realize this is uh
yeah it's absurd for somebody with like
me with no medical training whatsoever
to make that kind of a statement so
again do not make any medical changes
based on anything you hear from me right
you could take your vitamin D I feel you
know I feel if I tell you to you know
lose weight and exercise amongst you
know
safe ground
but when it comes to what meds you take
do not listen to me all right I'm just
saying I don't I don't believe the
entire
structure and then when I look at the
trade-off
like if the only way I could lower my
blood pressure if it makes a difference
is the only way I could do it was with
these meds that totally destroyed my
quality of life now I don't know maybe
there's some other bed that doesn't who
knows but I doubt it
I kind of doubt that lowering my blood
pressure no matter what drug I use
I doubt that's good for me
I could be wrong
I'm totally open to being wrong
somebody says is narcissistic is it
is it narcissistic to say I don't trust
Medical Science within the context of
knowing it's been lying to us
it's not like it's not like I'm guessing
that sometimes they give us bad
information
I mean that's the most established fact
you could ever establish
uh
oh here's one Jillian says Really Scott
regulations would allow houses to be
built 150 times faster
I can't tell if you're joking you're not
you're not imagining that I think that
right
uh
all right
he's joking
Maybe
he had doctors incurring smoking at one
time right
Ashley says when will I release my full
power and save the country
does the country need save it
I don't know I think the country's doing
okay
you know you'd have to be more specific
what is it I'm saving
or let me ask you this
what is it that I'm that I've been uh
persuading that you don't think is going
to go my way
so you see me persuading on Tick Tock do
you think I'm not going to get my way
oh that's going to get banned it's going
to take way longer than I wanted to but
tick tocks could get banned
ESG already dead man walking right
Fentanyl
you don't think we're going to attack
the the cartels
I mean nothing happens instantly but you
don't think that's going to happen of
course we are
yeah of course we are
what is it that you want me to persuade
that's not going to happen anyway
I mean I I can push things I think I
think there's a good chance
that a Republican president whoever it
is is just gonna
fire everybody at the top of all those
organizations
DeSantis would
wouldn't it
it you know I think it's somewhat
unlikely but if DeSantis became the
candidate
I think he could tell you he was going
to fire everybody in those jobs and
you'd believe it he probably would
uh anti-inflammation
uh oh pronouns
so
here's how you should deal with the
pronouns part
Obama gave you the formula
and because you don't like Obama you
won't take his advice right
Obama basically says yes find to is fine
to ask us to use your pronouns
but don't get mad if we don't
I mean I'm that's a little bit of an
oversimplification that's pretty close
right he's basically saying it's fine to
ask for it
but don't get mad at us if we get that
wrong
that is exactly the right take
you should say you can ask for anything
you want
and I'll ask you the same I'll ask you
not to be concerned if I use it wrong
and they demand right and then you
demand
but you should allow their demand
because they have a right to demand
you don't have to do it
you have a right to demand that they not
care
see the The High Ground
The High Ground is
is what Obama found Obama found The High
Ground on us The High Ground is yeah you
could ask for anything you want it's a
free country
good go ahead and ask and then when we
get it wrong
get over it
just get over it
it's not that important
I think that was exactly the right take
yeah if you fight it you just look like
you're a bigot
right if you tell them don't criticize
me if I if I get some words wrong then
you've turned them into the bigot
you get that
the way you're playing it you turn
yourself into the bigot because that's
just the way they can frame you
the way Obama suggests you play it is to
turn those people into the bigot if they
have a problem with you because you
didn't have a problem with them
right if they want to ask go ahead
I don't have a problem with anybody
asking me for anything
but they should also not have a problem
with you You're simply asking them not
to be bigots I'm not a bigot
you can do what you like
but I would like to say in consideration
that's all that is the way to go
that is the way to go
I saw the following argument from Pierce
Morgan
who I believe is a illogical argument
okay he was talking with some pro-trans
person I think
um and
uh he was no that wasn't protrans it was
pro-identification so somebody who was
arguing that you know there are lots of
genders and people should be able to
identify with whatever gender
they like and
then Pierce had apparently tried to
identify as a
two-sold penguin
a two-souled penguin and then they said
hey that's no fair you can't identify as
a penguin and that pierce said why not
if everything's if everything's
in the conversation
why can't I identify as a penguin
and the answer is
that's not logical
no
you don't see a difference there
you don't see a difference
you're talking about people who actually
believe
that they you know their identification
versus someone who doesn't
seem the same to you
now certainly the rules have to be the
same like the law has to be the same so
if the rules are you can identify as
anything to get benefits then Pierce is
right
if identifying as a penguin would get
you a college degree absolutely
I I encourage you to identify as
Penguins if you can get money for doing
it of course I'm on your side be a
penguin if if it pays
but I don't think that's the same
situation
I do believe that you know you could you
can characterize it as you know mental
defect if you want that's that's not my
position
but
would you disagree that the people with
these identifications is because they're
actually trying to identify themselves
in a way they're comfortable with that
makes sense that's completely different
than Piers Morgan being a penguin you
that's such a bad argument for Pierce
and I'm surprised that he wasn't called
out for it because while I think you
know the identifying is stuff yeah it
probably went too far
but uh that's not the argument against
it
it's a learned ideology
does that change anything that doesn't
change my point
so I think that I think the uh the push
back here is that people are not
necessarily born feeling these
confusions or identifications they may
they may be encouraged into it by the
way their their uh socialized
and that's true but that doesn't change
my point it doesn't matter how you got
there
right if you got there because somebody
influenced you or you got there because
you're genetically there you're still
there
that's what you feel and in a free
country
should you should you be able to feel
like somebody else's gender
and then ask people to treat you that
way sure
sure you could ask but again you're
asking does not obligate me
by asking is fine
I'd like to know what you think
I mean if nothing else it tells me what
you're thinking I like that
so I'll tell you what I'm thinking I
mean no harm
sometimes I'll get the pronouns wrong
sometimes I just won't accept that
that's the right thing to say
but I'm not going to take any criticism
about it
because I'm going to let you live your
life you're going to do the same for me
whether you like it or not
uh it's all clownish and embarrassing
behavior that makes Society look stupid
is that important
I I see your point
like I can see why you would see it that
way
but is that important
is it
because it's not a society it's just
individuals isn't it
dude do you think it makes like
America look bad
maybe to some people
yeah
but has America looked bad every time it
moved toward greater
uh greater acceptance of people did
America look bad when it gave women the
vote
probably to a lot of countries did it
looked bad when it freed the slaves
probably to some countries
so I'm not sure we should be running
Things based on what looks bad to
countries we wouldn't want to be
oh we we'd hate for Saudi Arabia to have
a bad opinion of us so we better
be Muslims
yeah other countries opinions of us
have to be put in a little little box
yeah we make fun of Trudeau all day long
doesn't matter to him probably not
uh let's see lb LGB acknowledges sex
transition
don't know what the point is
uh did I see Tim cast last night I did
not was there something on timcast
that you wanted to call him
uh watch Bannon on Tim pool last night
it was uh legendary what was legendary
about it
um
oh yeah yeah it's funny Tucker Carlson
is saying a couple things on television
that looks like it's amazing that
there's not more pushback so
he flat out says F you to the Deep state
are you abandoned us
yeah
okay
uh Bannon wore a penguin suit no he
didn't
um
what can we do about no accountability
how can we accept that government
accountability
well
um
you know the the changes that Twitter
might be a big part of it and maybe some
of the changes that CNN will be a big
part of it
um
[Music]
so I do think that ultimately the public
can turn the battleship it's just not
fast
turds talk
all right so uh the other thing that so
Tucker Carlson was saying that uh he
knows for sure now from his own source
that he doesn't tell us that the CIA was
involved in Killing Kennedy
so basically
Tucker Carlson
tells you that as a newly discovered
fact because he's got a source but we
don't know who the source is so keep
that in mind
now the other thing he said he just like
dropped it in when he was talking to a
guest he said that he knows that members
of Congress are being blackmailed
and he said it like he totally convinced
me that he knows members of Congress are
being blackmailed
Now by who I don't know but blackmailed
the FBI says Tucker is lying of course
they do
uh
right
Jillian says in all caps wish Scott
would admit he pushed mandates and
vaccines Etc now Jillian are you uh a
troll who's just here
like to make trouble are you actually a
stupid
because that would be the most stupid
 thing ever anybody ever said on
this live stream like are you actually
that ignorant and Confused
well it doesn't matter we'll we'll hide
you on this channel you're heading now
Jillian goodbye
uh
uh yeah who isn't
yeah yeah
you're right saying that the CIA was
involved
is a very generic word
so it could be that the CIA is
involved in everything you don't like
but not necessarily in a way that is
illegal or unethical
Scott critically argues both sides well
I show the costs and the benefits it's
amazing how many people
believe that you should not consider the
costs and the benefits of decisions like
actually believe that
um we think everybody's a low-level CIA
you know I was watching uh Glenn
grindwald tweeting this morning and he
brings up AOC for her non
let's say non-criticizing of the CIA
and he's wondering why AOC is not
criticizing the CIA
what does that suggest
why is he calling around by name
what does that suggest
I feel
like you suggesting AOC as a CIA uh
concoction
what do you think
is AOC
uh a CIA asset
do you think that they created her like
is she a creation because she's a media
creation right and who controls the
media
the CIA
so if somebody is a media creation for
the the Democrats like a like a
superstar has been created artificially
who did that
do you think CNN talk to MSNBC and they
talk to ABC they said hey let's get
together and push this on our own
maybe do you think they all just thought
the same and that's why it looks like
they coordinated maybe maybe the public
was interested so they just followed the
Public's interest maybe but when was the
last time Glenn Greenwald was wrong
about whose Court coordinating with the
CIA
so far not wrong
so far not wrong
now he doesn't come out and say it
but the context doesn't leave much doubt
and it doesn't seem let me ask you this
does it seem believable
does it seem believable the AOC would be
a CIA
preferred candidate or they helped her
somehow yeah totally yeah that that
would be easily within the ordinary line
of business there wouldn't be nothing
even unordinated about that that would
be just typical business sure
and if they're not
if they're not trying to influence her
why not should be the obvious one you
would try to influence because she has
influence you're not going to influence
people who have no influence so yeah
do you think she's ever met with any
agents for the CIA
think they've ever had lunch
I think I think anybody associated with
the CIA is a restaurant lunch
it's Washington of course they have
um
am I the CIA somebody else
foreign
I don't know
I don't know
is that a scary answer
it's an honest answer I don't know
yeah I can tell you for sure
that the CIA or people associated with
it have tried to influence me
but I'm not aware of anybody on the CIA
payroll
who has ever tried to influence me
but don't you think they would
if they're not trying to influence me
what the hell are they doing
because anybody who works for the CI can
see I can move the needle and they I
mean it wouldn't take long to figure
that out
so
if they're not trying to influence me
directly or indirectly they're not
they're not trying hard enough now how
would they do it
do you know
if they were trying to influence me and
let's say it was happening right now and
I was not aware of how would it happen
how would it happen
bribe me no if I were not aware of it if
they were influencing me without my
awareness how would it happen
they would send a fake friend
fake friend that's how they do it yeah
you suddenly you would be befriended by
somebody who's a little too anxious to
be your friend
that's how they do it
so has that happened to me
has anybody been a little too anxious to
be my friend and I couldn't figure out
why
yes
yes they have
yes they have
but do I know that that's part of an OP
I don't
no way to know
yeah
but I assume that the CIA would be
trying to influence everybody who is
themselves influential wouldn't you say
don't you think anybody who's who could
move the needle they're looking at and
trying to maybe get a get a get a friend
inserted there you know what I mean
friend of the agency get a little close
to you find out what's going on maybe
put a little something in your ear
what's the CIS is aim to control The
Narrative of course now not to a
specific end necessarily
but always to control it
because sort of their job
um
trolls are used and the trolls would be
doing what trying to discourage me from
saying some things
did you also see the story about the
Twitter files that the FBI kept looking
for all the foreign interference in the
elections and Twitter kept saying you
know we're not seeing much
and the FBI was like no we're all
confused we know there's got to be a lot
of foreign influence there and Twitter
kept saying Yeah you know
we looked it doesn't look like there's
much
and they just were not happy with that
does the CIA have good or bad goals it's
probably a mix because there are
individuals in the CIA as well as what
the CIA itself wants and then they're
probably departments within the CIA who
want different things than other
departments it's probably never clear I
mean it's it's entirely possible that
some people have the the CIA helping
them at the same time the CIA a
different person is trying to destroy
them
