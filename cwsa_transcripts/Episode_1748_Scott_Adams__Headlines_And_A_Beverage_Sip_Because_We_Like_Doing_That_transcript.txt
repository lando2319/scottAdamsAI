well good morning everybody and welcome
to
finally back on regular time zone
coffee with scott adams the best thing
that's ever happened to you in a long
time yeah
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
and i know you do
because that's the kind of people you
are would you settle for
second best no
no you're not that kind of people you're
the kind of people who want to take it
up a level and all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker tells
a steiner canteen jerky flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine here of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and
it's the best thing that's ever happened
to you nab is now go
well as you might know i returned from a
week
in
hawaii i was trying to
do a little
writer's
getaway now
many of you enjoy vacations
how many of you enjoy vacations in the
comments
do you enjoy vacations
i don't really know what that's like
exactly but i hear people love them
now for the past 33 years
which is really the only time i've had
enough money to take a vacation
i've also been working too hard to take
a vacation
so i don't know if i've ever taken one
where i wasn't also working
so this was a working vacation in fact
it was the only reason i did it i went
away for a week just to get away from
just the distractions of being home
let me show you what i came back to
uh so after my nice
relaxing but i worked all week but it
was still relaxing
my relaxing time in an ideal place
i come back to my house and
you should know that my home
has a feature in the front front lawn
there's this a very old and beautiful
stone oak it's a really interesting
gigantic tree it's sort of the main
feature
of the house
and by and by main feature of the house
i mean that um it's laying across the
lawn right now
so
that the main visual feature of my home
collapsed
yesterday morning i was laying across my
lawn
it's just you know dead
so that is the primary visual appeal of
my house just went away but
i went into my man cave after being gone
a week and missing my man cave and i
said to myself
you know i really want to relax
which is what you do in the man cave
and so i was relaxing in there and
until i saw that i wasn't alone
in the man cave
i had a little friend
you see him
that was behind my chair
as i was trying to relax
do you know
if you're trying to relax
and you see a california king snake
coiling through your garage by your feet
well maybe five feet away from my feet
it it doesn't put you in a relaxed mode
let me just say that if i could
summarize
summarize the feeling that i had at that
moment it was
if this were relaxed
it would be somewhere over here
different
kind of a gap between those two concepts
now
what some of you know that i did not
know at the moment
this is a good snake
it actually
is non-venomous and people are happy to
see them
because they chase away dangerous snakes
they eat other snakes i guess that's why
they're called the king california snake
so the good news is totally safe
i don't have to do anything about it i
just let him out and he was fine it was
kind of beautiful frankly
but wow was that a creepy scary looking
thing
wow so that's what i came back to
and wi-fi didn't work i was a mess
but we're back at it
let's talk about the news china just
announced or
i guess
gave some publicity too it's a china
drone mothership
so they've created a vessel which
carries 50 drones
now 50 sounds like either a lot of
drones or not many drones depending on
what kind of drones they are but
something tells me these are the good
kind like the really expensive kind that
maybe don't come back i don't know do
they come back
i'm not sure if they come back and land
on the ship or how many of these are are
meant to
be suicide attack drones
but a mother ship with 50 drones it
looks like that's going to be the future
of
naval warfare
actually in the future of all where
warfare is just gonna be drones
it's just gonna be all drones
um
i'm thinking about reading
my book
the religion war that i wrote in
2003 or whatever it was and it's about a
about a future when
basically it's all drones
thinking of reading that
because um i never signed away the audio
rights
for that book so i might just read it
into the locals platform
if i get a chance all right um
here's a question i asked did you know
that a 3d printer
can make 90 of the parts for
a 3d printer that's right
you can get a 3d printer to make
most of
another 3d printer now i think it's
probably the electronics that's the part
you'd have to buy but if you didn't have
a shortage
of the chip part which we probably do by
the way but if you didn't i asked this
hypothetical question
somebody says it's the print head yeah
so
there may be some parts you can't quite
do yet
but 90 of it you can do although i
suspect that the ten percent you can't
do is the important part
you know the really vital part and the
part you can do is probably the case
um
but if you could do 90 of
that i asked this question how long
would it take if you had one printer one
3d printer
and your goal was to make
drones
the small ones
so apparently you can make almost all of
the parts 90 again
of a drone
and it's a drone that would be good good
enough
to be part of a military operation so it
could drop
drop a grenade for example or or do
reconnaissance that sort of thing and so
the question i asked is and and of
course they could be suicide drones
so i asked how long would it take if you
just had one 3d printer
but you had no shortage of the 10 stuff
that was coming in how long would it
take for it to make extra printers
and then
those extra printers make drones if you
had lots of space
and lots of money
which the us military could certainly
have right
and
it's one of those uh fascinating
situations because on day two
you might not even have a second printer
right
but on day three
you'd have close to three of them and
then the three of them would be creating
each of them a new printer a piece
so do you know that you know the famous
mental experiment where you take a penny
and put it on a checkerboard in the
corner
and then you say okay i'll double the
penny in each subsequent box so the
second one is two cents
and then four cents eight cents 16. and
your common sense says wow
by the time this keeps doubling all the
way around the checkerboard
that one cent could turn into thousands
of dollars
right that's why your common sense is
telling or maybe hundreds maybe your
common sense would say wow this is going
up so fast that by the time we get to
the end of the checkboard it could be
could be hundreds or thousands of
dollars from just that one penny
and then you find out
it's like a gazillion trillion
you're so far off
you are so far off
guessing what will happen when you
double stuff that many times you're just
not even close right it's not hundreds
it's not thousands it's it's a tragion
gillian or something
and so that's what would happen with the
3d printers it would start off slow a
printer makes another printer makes
another printer
but by the
30th day
you could probably be producing 500
drones
a day
now what could ukraine do with 500
drones that were suicide drones per day
right now of course there are real world
limitations for everything so you can't
just do this
but interestingly you could very quickly
scale up if you could get the other 10
for both the printer and the and the
drones
to massive scale and you know a month or
two fairly massive
um so just an interesting thing to think
about
so the reason i i bring this up is i
have a hypothesis
that somewhere in the united states
there is a massive drone factory that
you haven't heard of
and that has spun up in the last six
months
what do you think
because doesn't it seem as though there
should be some super secret drone
factory
that we
put together in the last six months to
just massively create drones for ukraine
probably but i think the problem is that
they can't get the parts so even if you
had the factory you'd still be limited
with chips and stuff i think
i heard somebody say that the us has
been trying to
compete with china on drones is it dj
is that the big
drone company out of china i think they
have a massive market here and i saw
somebody speculate that the us didn't
have the
the technical skill to make these drones
to which i said what
of course we do
are you serious
i'm sure we have more technical skill to
make drones than china does
if china is dominating the market it's
because of price
am i right
that's the only reason they would
dominate the market they wouldn't have
better drones
would they
i mean i don't think so
so i've got a feeling that we'll find
out about a giant secret drone making
facility
someday
um speaking of stuff like that so biden
i thought i saw a headline that said
biden is using that wartime production
act to make baby formula
to which i say
wasn't that like you know didn't uh
joel pollock
suggest that like a week or two ago
i feel like that's an idea that under
the trump administration would have been
a 24-hour turnaround
am i wrong
uh under the trump administration i
actually watched this in person i i
watched
an idea go from hey this is a good idea
to actually an executive order
in like
maybe 48 hours i've actually seen it
done under trump and
how long have we known this uh
this baby formula thing was going to be
a problem
i mean biden has yet another thing to
explain i mean there might be some
logical reason or something
but i
this could not look worse
i i've never seen an administration fail
this hard have you
in your memory have you ever seen the
administration fail this hard
i guess the
you know the left would have said it was
trump
but even the leftists
um i i can tell you that as of yesterday
yesterday i talked to a lifelong
republican
uh i won't give you the context but it
was a lifelong i'm sorry a lifelong
democrat
who just said he's he's voting all
republican from now on
lifelong democrat yep voting republican
from now on
and i'm not going to tell you what
demographic he was
but it wasn't the one you expect
i'll just say that it wasn't the one you
expect
so
i don't know what's going to happen in
the next elections but i cannot
imagine oh and right
did i talk about this that
i think i said yesterday that elon musk
said he would vote republican from now
on because the democrats have become the
party of
division and
hate or something
oh my god
that is quite a thing to say
you know which is why he's elon musk and
you're not
because
is he the best tweeter now
if trump were still tweeting i'd say you
know
they're basically only two people in
that stratosphere
but now that trump is off i think i
think musk is the top tweeter
by far somebody says yeah i think by far
now how many of you remember that
elon musk came out of the paypal
that was an original startup
that he was on there with uh
several people
um
and i wonder if they were to have a
paypal reunion now
yeah peter thiel is there
i wonder if they were to have a reunion
now that they would have something to
talk about politically
that would be uh
pretty interesting
all right
gas prices
i keep hearing people say my god the gas
prices are up to over four dollars now
to which i say
can i get some of that four dollar gas
will somebody sell me some four dollar
gas because our gas is way over six
dollars for premium
so when i fill up it's over six dollars
a gallon now i mean not that you're
feeling sorry for me but just as a
marker of the times
um
and all of this is self-inflicted by
democrats is it not
is completely self-inflicted all
predictable
all all completely known that if you do
this you're going to get this and did
they not slow walk us right into the
situation
because it looks like it it looks like
they slow walked us with intention into
shortages
now i hear people say some people want
the shortages and you know it's part of
their radical agenda i've never heard
from anybody like that so i'm a little
skeptical anybody really believes that
but who knows
all right so it's all-time new high
again gas
how do democrats get elected under this
these conditions i don't know
here's my provocative thought for the
day
if the founders of this country
the ones who put together the original
constitution
if they knew that 3d printers
were coming
would they have given us a
constitutional right to own them
like guns
what do you think
if the founders knew that 3d printers
were coming would it be would they have
put like the second amendment would they
put an amendment in there to say that
citizens can own them and that the
government cannot monopolize them
i feel like they would have
i mean there's no way to know
but think about it
there's a reason they put that gun one
in there
right now
you could argue that the gun thing is
always going to be special that's a
special case but if you're going to be
defending yourself
uh i'd rather have a 3d printer than a
gun
if you had a 3d printer and i'm saying
high-end so really we're still talking
about the future
in the future you'll be able to print a
proper gun you can already do it but i'm
talking about like a real proper gun you
know you could make a gun
that would kill somebody but i mean like
a real weapon like a serious weapon
not sort of a toy
yeah i i feel as if the stuff that the
3d printers can make at the moment
are more of a novelty than an actual
weapon you know they fire sure
but it's more like you know killing
somebody in a special case it's not
really a weapon weapon
so i would expect that 3d printers will
be illegal for citizens to own if they
are above a certain level let me ask you
this
would it be legal for a citizen to own a
printing press
capable of making u.s currency that is
indistinguishable from the real thing
would that be legal
i'm assuming no
somebody says yes that would be legal
now is it because the paper is the real
trick
so they can just control how you make
the paper or something yeah you need the
right paper exactly but couldn't you
also bleach
existing currency
or did they take that away
because it used to be used to bleach an
old like a dollar bill and then turn it
into a 20 or something
yeah
all right
so yeah i would expect 3d printers will
be illegal at the high end someday
and you wonder how could they possibly
control that
and i'm thinking they'll probably
control it in much the way that they
control copyright
and
so which means that they would do it
imprecisely you know you you could still
get away with it but it might not worth
be worth the risk all right uh
ex-president george w bush was giving a
speech and he said this tragically
he said quote
the decision of one man to launch a holy
unjustified and brutal invasion of iraq
i mean ukraine
ukraine
so
yes uh there was there was a leader once
who
authorized a holy unjustified and brutal
invasion of iraq but who was that who
was that oh
oh yeah
george w bush
well there's more
more drama coming out of the amber turd
trial
the johnny depp depp
according to witnesses especially ember
turds sister
uh turd too no amber amber's sister we
don't have any reason to dislike her
but she
she was the most direct witness to say
that he observed johnny depp hitting his
face his
hitting her sister repeatedly in the
face
while holding her hair
now
do you believe that
because
do you have any siblings
does anybody have a sibling
would you witness a sibling being
punched in the face
by anybody
and then say well you know that's your
business
i don't think i want to get involved
can you even imagine that
first of all
if you saw a sibling getting punched in
the face you wouldn't get in the fight
seriously
like you wouldn't be right there
punching the chin out of johnny
depp if you saw that happening
like who wouldn't do that
so there's something about the sister's
testimony that's not
quite
striking me as believable
now i hope i hope it's not true because
it sounds horrible and if it's true of
course johnny depp
you know needs to be responsible for his
actions we don't know the context but i
can't imagine any context where that
would be appropriate
you know even self-defense it didn't
sound like it was even self-defense
really
so
i got a question about that so then
you've got a few other witnesses uh
testifying on her behalf
but some of those were contradicted by
other people
so
what do you think is true
based on
what would you say at this point
do you believe that they were violent to
each other
or that one of them was primarily the
violent one
what do you think
because we have to well we don't have to
but we're judging it from afar
based on evidence that's being presented
well there's no doubt that johnny depp
had a substance use situation
um
i was just reading eric's comment there
on
youtube
all right
i don't know
i i think if i had to cast my vote right
now i would say that
here's a question i would ask
has johnny depp ever been accused of
hitting anybody else
don't you feel that's a valid question
under these circumstances
now that would not prove that he did or
did not do anything with amber heard but
wouldn't you like to know that
because if i heard that he had ever done
this with another
woman
i would be inclined to think he did it
this time too you know assuming that i
believe the original story if there were
two stories that were
weirdly similar
that would be
that'd be pretty believable
but i don't know that that's an evidence
nor could it be
do do we think that would even be legal
to bring that in as a
context i don't know how that works
can you do that
um
so here's a question for you
if
amber
uh if her actions were so outrageous
that she was causing an inebriated
johnny depp to feel that he needed to
hit her again there's no excuse
so violence cannot be condoned under any
circumstance so if it sounds like i'm
defending an abuser that's the opposite
of what's happening so don't
don't take that interpretation
but at some point
poking the bear
is wrong too
right
there is some level of provocation
which will cause anybody to do anything
but let me just put it that way you take
it out of the context of domestic abuse
just take it completely out of that
context
there is some amount of provocation
that will make anybody do anything
and we we sort of treat it like that
doesn't matter
i feel like it does
you know and maybe maybe that's why you
have jury trials so they can take into
consideration stuff like that
well it seems that the so-called
ministry of truth is being disbanded the
public uh ran down a town
so what was it called the disinformation
board
and they were going to tell you what was
true and what wasn't
well it got so
so much pushback
rightfully so that they disbanded it and
the woman who's in charge of it resigned
and they're not going to do that anymore
so no more
so-called ministry of truth
and totally unrelated news
i don't even know why i bring this up at
this point
but um
we've got a new thing um
so we lost the ministry of the so-called
ministry of truth that's just what
people were calling it
but we've got this new thing under the
democrats maybe it passed the house but
not yet the senate it's called the the
domestic terrorism prevention act
so that passed the house yesterday
and it's created to quote assess the
threat posed by white supremacists and
neo-nazis
so
it's a good thing they got rid of that
ministry of truth because we were afraid
that they might
use it politically
to target people on the other side
because if one side is in charge of the
truth
and what is true and what is not well it
feels like that could be used
politically which is why people ran that
idea out of town
but now we have this new thing which is
some kind of an upgrade apparently
so they'll have a group that's just
looking to identify
the white supremacists and neo-nazis
among us
i i wonder what could go wrong
do you think oh maybe it could get a
little political
do you think maybe that these were two
attempts to hunt republicans
and one of them wasn't aggressive enough
because it was just talking about it but
the other one was actually to label some
americans white supremacists and
neo-nazis
and i wonder do you think anybody who's
not quite one of those things could ever
be dragged into that conversation
and do you think that maybe just being a
republican
and maybe let's say maybe you went
someplace and that you're photo taken
and you didn't know exactly
the reputation of the person you were
are you a neo-nazi now if you had your
photo taken with somebody who
has those uh leanings
i don't know
so if you were the this uh let's say it
gets passed by the senate i i
have a feeling it won't be but if it did
um
who do you think they're going to call
white supremacists and neo-nazis
they've called
pretty much all republicans
white supremacists and neo-nazis have
they not
do you see any problem with that
do you remember my
do you remember my prediction that
everybody mocked me for
when i said that if biden is elected
republicans will be hunted
and people said oh god you've
you really jumped the shark this one
they're not going to hunt republicans
nothing like that's going to happen
except the domestic terrorism prevention
act might be a little bit um
maybe aggressive
and who they determine is a neo-nazi and
a white supremacist
what what what ideology do you think
would get you
identified as a white supremacist what
would be an example
let's say somebody was
very strong on border security
and let's say that their reasoning
was that they didn't want the the
culture of the country to change this is
not my opinion i'm giving i'm i'm
talking about some person right
so there's some person who's uh strong
on border security
and their reasoning is they don't want
the the character or culture of the
country to change
in a let's say in an unguided way
in a random way that's determined by
other people basically
what would they be they'd be a white
supremacist wouldn't they
wouldn't they
because i would be somebody who is
targeting
people of color
and wanting to disadvantage them
relative to what the situation could
have been which is they all get to come
in
so if you're a white republican
and you've got a public stand
that is
bad for people of color
not americans but people of color who
would like to get into america
how is that not a white supremacist
according to democrats
this is a real
this is some really sketchy stuff here
um
so i was on vacation last week something
else
but i did i did my live streams just at
the wrong different times most of the
time
all right
well you know fortunately we can trust
democrats
um to do the right thing
um which brings me to a rasmussen poll
uh which asked how likely is it that the
clinton campaign officials acted
illegally during the 2016 presidential
election and that number is 55 percent
now
so a
majority of americans believe that the
top democrat
powers the clinton campaign at the time
uh acted illegally and basically rigged
the election
but you know even though 55 of them
think that the democrats are rotten at
the top
um i'm really looking forward to this
new group that's going to determine
which ones of us are neo-nazis and white
supremacists
that i don't see a problem there
so do you remember the story of keith
renery and nexium and the alleged sex
cult that was
a subgroup of some of the same people
and keith renery got
convicted and he's in prison now
and but he's claiming and there's some
expert testimony that backs up the claim
with evidence
that he was framed um framed by the law
enforcement basically
i think fbi is being accused
now i don't have an opinion
because how would i know of whether
keith ranieri was framed or not
but in the context of today's news and
what you've seen lately who is more
credible
the fbi
or a person incarcerated and blamed of
accused of terrible crimes and found
guilty by a jury of his peers
which one is more credible
in 2022
it's a tie
it's a tie he's got a story
about being set up
to which i say
there was a time i would have said well
that's ridiculous
you know i'll just go with law
enforcement on this one but not anymore
not anymore no i'm not saying he's
innocent how would i know who knows
but i'll just say the credibility of the
accusers
and the credibility of the accused are
now roughly the same
roughly the same
so
good job government
well
in case i'm all being all negative today
the democrats have done a number of bad
things
but
thank goodness they're stopping the
fentanyl
traffic into this country
no they're not
no they're not
it turns out that fentanyl overdoses and
other overdoses are an all-time high
i saw the wall street journal had some
opinion piece speculating that the
lockdowns
were a cause of the greater addictions
how many of you accept that as true
just on its face
so we don't we don't have a study of
that
but how many because it did turn out
that overdoses spiked at exactly that
right time
how many you think
that the lockdowns caused more
overdose deaths
i'd say
very likely
but i'm not quite ready to say yes
because here's the variable which is not
um
maybe not in play
how much fentanyl came in how many extra
things that didn't have fentanyl in them
got fentanyl added to them
was there any change in the way fentanyl
was made or produced to make it more
deadly
so i would be asking lots of questions
about
whether the product itself changed or
evolved or got worse
i wouldn't necessarily say that the only
reason is because there was a lockdown
although the timing the timing is pretty
suspicious and our common sense
tells us it's likely right
so i
but uh
you know i i think that the bible
demonstration they started with this
ministry of truth and now they've got
this other uh
republican hunting organization going on
there
uh hunting and tagging republicans but i
think what they really needed was uh
they should create a new ministry
so i'd like to see the biden
administration create the
ministry of not doing a thing
about fentanyl because that would be
racist
because apparently the big pushback
is that there are over a hundred groups
who are advocating for lower fentanyl
dealer
sentences
because
sentencing people for fentanyl would be
racist because you'd get more people of
color presumably
arrested
so
if that's their point of view and it
seems that the administration is
influenced by that then why not just
create the ministry of not doing a
 thing about fentanyl because
that would be racist
let's just label it what it is
if that's their argument if they're not
going to do a thing about a
hundred thousand people dying every year
if they're not gonna do a thing
just create a department to not do a
 thing
just own it
just own it that's all i'm
asking for it's okay to do nothing well
it's not okay but if you're gonna do
nothing
just own it
don't do nothing and tell me you're
doing something because you're not
do nothing and then just create a whole
worthless piece of bureaucracy
to brag to everybody how nothing you're
 doing
some of you might know i have a little
bit of an attitude about this fentanyl
situation
maybe you've heard
um
wow
if i were a
single issue voter this would be my
single issue
all right
um some of you have asked why is the
russian ruble doing well and
the dollars not as well as the ruble
apparently
and i saw a great uh thread by uh
azleckberg who seems to know what he's
talking about and he explains it simply
this way
um russia can support the ruble by just
telling people that they have to pay
them in rubles
say you can buy our our oil
but you're gonna have to convert your
money to rubles first because we're only
going to take rubles
as long as people want to buy their oil
and energy in general
then
the ruble will stay high because
there's an artificial demand for it
but
the the sanctions against russia are
more about their imports
so the sanctions about them selling
things are
not as aggressive at the moment
it probably take a long time for people
to get alternate sources of energy etc
so they can't really close down russia's
exports right away
but we're apparently trying to
them we meaning the people in charge of
sanctions
by
by limiting what comes in now eventually
if you limited all their imports
you would close down their exports too
so if you stop their imports that will
eventually get to everything because
they won't be able to you know build a
new refinery they won't be able to
repair something that breaks eventually
would shut down the whole country
because they don't make
chips and stuff
enough in russia
so does that make sense
that
that the reason that russia's ruble is
good is that we're not doing much about
what they're selling
but we're doing a lot about what they're
buying and that doesn't have as much
impact on the ruble
about that for a simple economic
explanation did that did that clear
anything up for you
or did that just confuse you
i'm seeing no plausible
well the plausible part is right i mean
i'm pretty sure the explanation is right
about the minion plushie at the top
shelf
somebody's asking about my minion well
it's not a plushy it's it's ceramic
but uh it was just a gift at one point i
just liked it
um
all right so i think that
cleared that up for you
glad to help
and uh
i offer this following test
so that we might all know once and for
all
and again i don't care
because we're past it
but do masks work
and i have a specific way to test it
that i don't know has been tested but
maybe you've seen it it goes like this
in my way of thinking we all know that
mass do not stop viruses from spreading
would you all agree
everybody on the same page
we do know the masks do not stop the
spread
everybody
now we don't know if it slows it down
some say yes some say no but we do know
it didn't really show up in the in the
high level numbers right
there's nobody who used masks and just
masks and you know got rid of the the
virus so i think you're all on the same
page
that especially the regular mass no
let's not talk about m95s we're talking
about the public regular masks we all
agree that regular mass allow virus to
spread
and you can get it okay everybody's on
the same page on that
but number two
this is the part that i always talk
about that nobody does which is i
thought we knew
that the degree of or the quantity of
virus you initially get makes a
difference for your survival
am i right
now i don't know that that's been
debunked and so my hypothesis is this if
masks worked and i'm going to put work
in quotes because i'm not talking about
stopping infection because i don't think
you did or at least in a significant way
but
in theory
you would have a high level infections
just like everybody else if you wore
masks
but your death rate would be
noticeably lower
so if you looked at the ratio of
infections
to deaths it should be better where
there are masks
and less good where the masking
compliance is less
what do you think
now again i'm not telling you the mass
worked or didn't work i'm suggesting a
way to study it
that i think would be conclusive
and i don't know that that's been
studied because we keep conflating do
they stop infections
with do they work and they're not the
same question
do you get that
if you say do masks stop infections no
but that's not the same as do mass work
in some functional way that you wish you
wish you had one i don't know the answer
to that now to be clear
because i've been misinterpreted a
number of times i absolutely am against
mass mandates
and i can't imagine wearing one again
myself
so i'm completely against it because the
the social cost is too high and we
didn't see enough of a difference in the
top level numbers
so completely against it but wouldn't
you like to know
i mean really
now southern cal
south korea versus california wouldn't
work and the reason is that south korea
can't be compared to anybody who didn't
have a really good testing
so south korea's secret was testing they
say
you know they would also say the mass
worked but really it was probably
testing and then obesity was part of the
issue as well
right
all right
did i leave anything out
is there any topic
that you wish i had mentioned
and are you glad
that as many people got infected as they
did
in a sense because i think the united
states is done and other countries are
because we had enough natural infection
but the countries that didn't have the
natural infection might be in trouble
although they've got omicron now so it
won't be that big a deal
nuclear
yeah there's nothing new on nuclear is
there
any update on the yes did you see the
rasmussen tweet
that the rasmussen
twitter account and there's some some
suggestion there might be some
suppression going on
but
i i retweeted it this morning so you can
see it in either rasmussen's feed or in
my feed but there is one individual
who allegedly we'd know his name and
address
and he allegedly
went to
multiple drop boxes and and left from
multiple
non-profit agencies
so he would be an example of the very
thing that two thousand mules wants to
prove
which is that they have the names of
somebody who's an actual person who went
to multiple boxes
and apparently the allegation is that
nobody wants to talk to him
like the press is completely
uninterested
i don't know
i i
i think
i think i'm going to go with
i don't believe anything about anything
with a story
so i don't believe that we know
or that we have any way to know if an
election is
rigged
because we don't do complete audits it's
just not a thing so if you don't do a
complete audit you can't ever know you
can only know you didn't find a problem
but i also
don't believe any accusation
now do you remember when when there were
first accusations about the
improprieties in the election do you
remember a
prediction i made
at the very beginning of trying to see
if anything sketchy happened in the 2020
election
at the very beginning
i said
at least 95 of everything you hear as an
allegation will be false
does anybody remember me saying that
that 95 percent of everything people say
happened in the election will be
debunked
and there we are
i would say 95 of the claims were
debunked
the the venezuelan general
voting machine stuff
there's no evidence of that
yeah
so but
does it mean anything if 95 percent of
the allegations are debunked
well not if not if the other five
percent turn out to be true
it doesn't take much
does it it only takes one
you know one actual real thing to change
an election
yeah and maybe there was a little bit of
everything as somebody says we don't
know the degree
you you have to assume that there's
always a little bit of
chick cannery in every election you just
never know how much
yeah we haven't been talking about
droning the mexican cartels enough
now do
how many people think that
trump was crazy for talking about
droning the laboratories or the
the cartels um
headquarters or whatever they were in
mexico
how many think that's just crazy
how many think that that idea came from
me
because i'm pretty sure i'm the only
public figure who said that before you
heard that trump had also heard it
does anybody think that came from me
because i was the only one saying it i'm
pretty sure
now that doesn't mean he didn't come up
with the idea on his own because it's
sort of obvious
i mean it's the question you would ask
and by the way one of the reasons i
could never be president
is because i could never survive
uh the brainstorming conversations taken
out of context
because i would do exactly what trump is
getting in trouble for all the time
i throw ideas
that had not yet been on the table
so i would say well can we just kill
that person
and then somebody would say no don't do
that and i say okay
and then i say well
should we just you know nuke that thing
and then people would say no no you
can't use nukes here are all the good
reasons and i'd say those are good
reasons
but i would throw all kinds of crazy
just to see how people would respond to
it
and that would tell me something right i
i would know if they had ruled something
out by reflex or if they really thought
about it
so when
when trump throws out ideas like can't
we just you know lob a drone in and take
out the cartels
i say that's good presidenting
that is good presidenting he asked the
question
and he asked it of exactly the right
person and then when that person gave
him an answer which apparently was
sufficient
that he didn't do it
so it's reported as some kind of like
wild crazy reckless thing that trump did
and i'm listening to it and i'm thinking
well you just gave an example of perfect
presidenting that was perfect
he asked he asked the question they
should have been asked that absolutely
should have been asked
he got the answer
from an expert
he took that into consideration and
that's the way we went
perfect president thing
and it's yeah reported as some kind of
flaw
of course
oh uh trump told oz to claim victory do
we have another one of those
did oz
he did didn't he win
is that still in question the uh the oz
primary
went to a runoff
interesting
so he told them to
claim victory well why not
isn't that just standard procedure to
claim
oh yes now there's talk about monkey pox
a variant of the bubonic plague
madagascar has got a case of it or
something so yeah monkey box
can't wait for the monkey box to come
i feel like
there's something else coming don't you
all right and there was a case in
connecticut somebody says
yeah who was having sex with the monkey
is what i want to know
and was the monkey attractive these are
the questions we want to know
um
monkey box yeah okay i'm not even gonna
say that out loud
uh
all right
ladies and gentlemen let me ask you this
following provocative question
it has been over
how long has it been since people got
their first vaccinations a year
and a half
is it a year and a half since the first
people got vaccinated
and it would be maybe
two years since the first
people in the trials got vaccinated
right
something like that so somebody says 13
months but closer to 18 months or two
years
so the question is this
would we be seeing the
the effects of the vaccination itself
because all vaccinations have risks
right so nobody's saying there's no risk
um but would we be seeing
80 of it
now if you said not necessarily you're
correct right so the correct answer is
not necessarily can we all agree on that
the correct answer is not necessarily
maybe maybe much later
but
statistically
and based on what we've seen with every
other
kind of drug would you say there's an 80
chance
that we have enough information
already
we don't know
to your point to your point which i
accept you don't know what the future
brings like you can't say oh we're done
there's you know
everything we know now is everything not
that
all right so i'm trying to be fair and
balanced here but
how many years would you have to wait
before you would be willing to say well
it looks like the vaccination itself
wasn't a problem
suppose we went five years
i suppose
and that the initial
studies about the risks of the vaccine
essentially help
that what we what we believed as we
entered the trial
was largely what we got five years later
somebody says 10 years
do you think that the difference between
five and ten years
is statistically important
here's my assumption but i would need a
somebody who's an expert to back me up
on this my opinion is that in five years
you would be at something like 99
certainty
and at 10 years closer to 100
you never get to 100.
but that's what it feels like
it feels like the first one year
you know almost everything you need to
know
in one year
but you know this vaccine is not like
other vaccines so maybe it's different
but after five years
i feel like five years would get you
well over a 90 certainty
but again
can you use the past
to predict what would happen with this
mrna
technology and the answer is
maybe not
but
wouldn't that be true for all of the
vaccines
that every one is a one-off
there's always something different about
it that's why it's a different vaccine
so isn't it always true that you don't
know for sure if that one year or five
years is going to tell you everything
you need to know you never really know
but i'm good
dax adams
so
um
you all know that i was against vaccine
mandates right
and i didn't get the the additional
boosters i got the first one because
that was part of the first set
but i didn't get any additional boosters
don't plan to
so
i determined that the reason that people
think that i was pro mask and pro
vaccine
is one tweet because when i when i
challenge people
that why they think my my view was the
opposite of what it was
they they produced one tweet
and uh the tweet was this
it was after i got vaccinated
i said that if you're vaccinated no i
said if you're not vaccinated you're in
a pandemic and if you are vaccinated
it's just tuesday
and apparently people
people
interpreted that as a pro-vaccination
stand
was it
let me let me say it again
so the tweet was if you're unvaccinated
you're in a pandemic
and if you're vaccinated
it's just tuesday
is that pro-vaccine
what do you think
um
i'm seeing guesses
some knows but i think i primed you too
much for that
i think yes would be a reasonable answer
but it wasn't what i was thinking
so
do you enjoy it when i
uh admit i was wrong
anybody
does anybody enjoy it when i confess
completely
that i was wrong
you like it
right so the tweet didn't say what i
hoped it didn't it didn't communicate
what i hoped it would communicate
and therefore it was a very bad tweet so
that's on me
so i'm going to say that the public's
interpretation of my opinion
was polluted by me
so so i did that myself
let me tell you what the tweet was
supposed to say
it was supposed to say
how i felt
that's it
and i assumed other people felt the same
so what i really meant was the day that
i got vaccinated and remember this was
before
things picked up and we went back to
some masking so
the masks were off
and then once i got vaccinated
um
there wasn't anything else i had to do
so i could fly
and i didn't have to wear a mask so for
me i no longer had to think about the
pandemic because i didn't have to put on
a mask and i didn't and i didn't have
any restrictions of where i traveled
so for me it was over
but that's not a statement about the
vaccination
that's a statement about i don't have to
do anything about the pandemic anymore
this doesn't need to be part of my
mental process
right now
you can see how i up with the
tweet right
does everybody agree that the tweet was
a mistake you see that right
because we were in such a partisan
situation
that what i was
blind to
and this is completely my mistake so i'm
not i'm not trying to hedge this at all
i'm taking full responsibility
in the context of people taking sides
that tweet was
very poor
because it looked like i was taking
science now i wasn't telling you what to
do
i was just telling you hey i'll bet a
lot of people feel like i do
once you do this you're done
somebody says stop apologizing
 you
 you
stop apologizing did that sound like an
apology
that was a statement of clarification
stop apologizing
 you really just you
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
consult your physician somebody says yes
if you're really sorry you look at peter
mccullough
in all caps eddie says
how many of you think that i need to go
read
the warnings of
the rogue doctors
i'm watching the stats
and those ro those rogue doctors will be
proven right or wrong
and if they're right
i'll i'll definitely be talking about
that
but do you believe that the rogue
doctors have been proven right
do you think that the current data at
least that's publicly available do you
think that the rogue doctors have been
proven right
i'm seeing not yet
not yet
right
somebody says not yet not yet
that's interesting i thought a lot of
you would say yes i'm not getting the
answers i expected so it's funny on
there there's definitely a difference
between the locals platform
audience and youtube
the the locals platform audience are far
more likely
to be analytically correct
and it's not an accident because it's
people who largely followed me on that
platform
because they like the analytical part
like how to look at it you know not not
the not my opinion of what's true or not
but how to look at it that's what they
tend to like
which is a good thing to like
all right
uh somebody says locals is an echo
chamber well
you know
that has more to do with the business
model
it's it's meant to be a community of
people built around a certain set of
you know ideas
so
yeah
i mean calling it an echo chamber is
sort of dismissing the fact that it's
designed to be that for its benefits
so you can get the other stuff anywhere
else you want
and and it's not like yeah it's not like
the echo it's not like the locals people
agree with me all the time
let me ask you this
on the locals platform how often do you
disagree with me
well it's a lot
all right
um
they're not more analytical they're more
agreeable somebody says no they're
actually
they're more
analytical
they almost always um
are more likely to see the hidden trap
so they've been trained to spot the
traps and not the regular public has not
largely
uh all the excess deaths above baseline
uh i don't believe the numbers
yeah so
you'll see lots of things on twitter you
know excess baseline deaths and like the
i have the same opinion of all of it
it's just not credible
some of it might be true
but there's nothing i could believe at
this point so only time is going to get
us a good answer
anything you're looking at today
let me say this if you saw online
somebody said baseline desks were
through the roof
and therefore the only explanation
it has to be the uh vex the vaccinations
themselves
but you're not seeing other entities
pick that up
take something from that right
sometimes it's because somebody got
suppressed
that's a real thing
but more often it's because other people
looked at it and said i'm not convinced
that's what i think
so while i would take it seriously
that there are smart people who have
found anomalies and the the death rates
i take that seriously
and i would definitely like people to
look into it
but i don't know that the story is that
everybody's ignoring it
i feel like the story is other people
looked at the data and said i don't see
it
i feel like that's what's happening
all right let's not talk about that
anymore
did spending 6 trillion for cove had
lead to facilitating war in ukraine
did it what would be the connection
there
um apparently there's a general
understanding now that
biden is
basically botched the afghanistan pull
out the baby formula thing he didn't act
fast enough
ukraine is kind of a mess he caused
inflation he caused the energy shortages
he basically caused every problem by his
actions didn't he
i feel like it
basically he literally caused every
problem we have
including
division
right everything
uh
why do people hate tesla because people
ate everything successful
the you know 40 of the public
is gonna hate anything that's successful
by the way
those of you who are saying that the 81
million votes is telling you something
that's not the best argument
it's not
because it leaves out the fact that the
country is bigger
and that people were more interested in
voting
so
i the the whole 81 million votes thing
that i don't find that persuasive
at all
it just it feels like an analytical
mistake
it just feels like of course
let me make a prediction
my prediction is that in 2024
more people will vote than ever before
anybody want to take the other side that
bad
it will be a record number of voters in
2024
because people will probably still care
and there will be more people
that's it it's pretty easy pretty easy
prediction
all right
uh
i guess we'll find out how many twitter
bots there are if elon musk gets a hold
of the company
and i think you will
yeah if trump runs it will definitely be
a record number of votes both both sides
all right
that's all for now
and i'm going to talk to you tomorrow
youtube best show ever i think
