do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
that's called coffee with Scott Adams
I'm pretty sure that science has never
discovered a more awesome time or
situation and you lucked into it wow
I guess your day's starting well but it
could be even better and all you need
for that is a cup of mug or a glass a
tanker jealous of Stein a canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
no Bud Light
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing makes everything better it's cold
the simultaneous sip if it happens now
don't forget the ah at the end go
ah
all right let's start out with
did you all see the meme which put Joe
Biden's face on Dylan Mulvaney
well you're gonna see it now
an ice cold my wife so good
happy Friday all right everyone so it's
Friday night I'm getting ready to help
I'm feeling kind before I go out I've
got a free game and the only way I
pre-game is with
an ice cold on lights
[Music]
so uh there are some things that AI will
be good for
so in case you were thinking AI what
good is AI
there you go
that's what it's good for
2024 election is going to be so much fun
oh my God it's gonna be meme versus me
all right so in other news there's a
report of three boats have been sunk in
Europe by orcas
is there a difference between an orca
and a whale
why does the story say orcas there is a
difference
okay
an orca is not a whale
it's a killer whale why can't I just
call it a whale
because it's an orca I guess
well all right so these orcas have sung
three boats but that's not the amazing
part the amazing part
is that they've been spotted teaching
other orcas how to do it
that's right the war is on
turns out that the animals have decided
to turn on the humans and they're just
going to kill us after all and it turns
out that the animals have a Navy
it's all orcas and the orcas are trading
um
I I don't know if NATO is trading them
or what but somebody's trading these
orcas to attack Naval vessels keep an
eye on that keep an eye on that
did you see a video not too long ago
where Joe Rogan was showing a video of a
uh of a rat that learned to use tools
it went and got a stick to click the the
rat trap so I could get the cheese
without getting hurt because it knew
what the rap trap was what the rat trap
was and it knew that if he used a tool
it could spring it it actually used a
tool a stick
and now we see these whales learning to
attack boats
put it all together people
put it all together
it's not just AI That's getting smarter
so they have the creatures the creatures
are starting to gang up
see it's sort of it's a total headshake
we're all looking at the robots and the
AI it's like oh look over there it's the
robots we're afraid of the robots and
the AI meanwhile
the orcas and the Rats
apparently I've conspired to take over
everything with their tool making and
such all right we'll keep an eye on that
here's a story I told in the man cave
last night but you're gonna have to hear
it
because it's important it's about the
simulation have you ever had this
situation where
you worried yourself into the exact
problem that you were trying to prevent
does anybody have that
that's that's like a real thing right
there's something that's never happened
to you before
and then because you're thinking of it
you just think yourself into the problem
well yesterday I went to take a ride in
my e-bike
and
uncharacteristically I thought to myself
you know what
I I'd hate to fall off my e-bike
because I'm at that age now where if you
get a serious sporting injury you know
maybe you don't come back
yeah it's kind of the end of your
Sporting Life if you have a bad one and
so I thought to myself about falling off
my e-bike and you know it's not like
I've never thought of it it's just I've
never dwelled on it before
so the first time I dwell on it
take my back up and I'm I'm going on
this uh path that's too small for
automobiles
and it looks like the path is going to
come to an end and I need to turn around
but the path had narrowed
to the point where turning around
without getting off your bike was going
to be kind of a challenge and there was
gravel on each side of the Narrow Path
and I said to myself I calculated all
right to do a very low speed turn
you know you you can't do it if it's too
narrow you'll fall off
and I thought I better get off my bike
and just you know walk it around and
then I thought to myself no no damn it
I'm no bicycle I'm I'm not afraid
of my bike I'm not going to talk myself
into being afraid of a bicycle damn it
I'm gonna just make this turn
so as I was flying through the air
on my way to the hard pavement below
because as you see the turn didn't work
out
it was one of those situations where I
really should have listened to that
little voice in my head this at well
that looks like really dangerous
you're not going to make it
so as I was uh departing from the
bicycle itself and more Airborne than
actually bike born
um time Stood Still
have you ever had that experience where
you know something bad is going to
happen and it's only going to be a
quarter of a second
but that quarter of a second seems to
just stop in time in your memory
so as I'm flying through the air
I have to do triage which part of my
body I want to sacrifice
I'm thinking arm no don't want a broken
arm
leg knee no no bad news head got a
helmet but still you don't want to land
on your head hands got to protect the
hands right because I work with my hands
so I'm running through all my body parts
I'm like no no no no no and I came up
with one body part that I thought I
could
I could get by with and it was this fat
part of my back
toward the top you know just past the
shoulder blade where there's like a
little bit of muscle here a little bit
of padding I managed to spin in the air
just fast enough to tuck and roll
hitting that back part of my back first
and I gotta say it was
it was quite a it was quite a crash
but I managed to pop up uninjured now
here that's not even the weird part
here's the part I didn't tell you last
night in the man cave
so have you had this situation where
there's something that never happens and
then it's everywhere
and you don't know did you cause that or
was it always just there or you didn't
notice it
so today I I'm looking through the news
to get my little news stories for the
show
and there's a story about Simon Cowell
who happens to be just about my age like
pretty close and how he got seriously
injured falling off his e-bike
now
I've only fallen off my e-bike once
just once
and then I turn it and there's like a
major story about a guy my age falling
off an e-bike
what are the odds of that
did I make that happen
see this is why I believe I live in the
simulation one explanation is oh it's
just a coincidence
the other explanation is well stories
about bike accidents we're always out
there you just didn't notice until you
were primed for it
or number three I caused it to happen
not only did I cause the accident
but I caused the news story about the
topic
so that's how I experience life like I
just caused it I don't know if it's true
but I also don't know anything else is
true well enough about me
uh the Wall Street journals reporting
that the bar exam for lawyers is going
to be made easier so that more black
people can become lawyers
so
that that's actually in the news
that's a real story
now of course the story they don't say
black people
yeah they have to wink at you well it's
to make it fair for everybody
you know but you know that you know
they're talking about
so
what do you think about that well I'll
tell you if I were currently a black
lawyer and I had passed the the hard bar
exam I would not feel good about being
presumably thrown in with the people who
did not pass the hard bar exam I got a
feeling that people are going to be like
I don't know
did you pass the real bar exam or the
new fake bar exam the easy one I'm not
sure so I feel like
we are not considering the
the side effects of some of our
decisions
you know as I've said before
um historically I've always supported
you know efforts to
increase inclusion and equity and not
Equity but equality of opportunity and
all that
including even uh
um affirmative action
historically but at some point am I
wrong that at some point it it gives you
more uh downside than upside
am I wrong about that that at some point
you could argue whether we're there or
not but at some point you need to stop
doing it before you've reached total
total equality
if you keep pushing it all the way to
everybody's equal all the time
there's no way that's good for everybody
it's just going to be such a such a
fight
but you know in the early days when when
the disparities are gigantic yeah maybe
you have to do something a little more
aggressive
but at the moment I really need to I
think we need to rethink this stuff
all right I saw another uh tweet from
somebody who's joining my opinion that
are worried about AI is at
least the current version and
um it's not nearly as useful for a lot
of things as you think it will be
so here here's what uh AI will be good
for really really good at complex
searches so it's a better search engine
really good at summarizing articles
which I would just call the search
engine
so I saw somebody say oh it's really
good at uh you know summarizing the pros
and cons of all these articles about
some topic to which I say you mean the
search engine
it's just a really good search engine oh
yeah
I mean it's really really good
but it's also unreliable so you've got
that but when it works it works pretty
awesome and then you know it's going to
be good for helping people who are
already programmers code
and you know lawyers will be able to
research case law and stuff like that so
there'll be a number of professions
in which if you're already an expert in
that profession your writer researcher
lawyer whatever is really going to help
but it doesn't look like it's coming
anywhere near taking jobs
it looks like it's just going to make
people work differently
and
so when I said I'm not worried about AI
becoming an existential threat in its
current form
the pushback I got was Scott
oh wow if I may give you some
condescending opinion about this whoa
wow Boomer Boomer let me explain to you
no we're not worried about the current
version of AI Boomer no Boomer we're
worried about where it's obviously going
you know yes maybe version 1.0 is not
going to destroy the world but obviously
as it gets smarter and smarter the risk
increases and Boomer a boomer please
please Boomer I just maybe you shouldn't
even talk about things you don't know
about please
to which I say
your genius idea that a rabbit can
evolve into a truck
is not persuading me
oh yeah
bad microchips do evolve into better
microchips that's the thing bad
smartphones do evolve into better
smartphones
totally bad cars evolve into better cars
yep but not once in the history of the
whole universe as a rabbit
turned into a truck
and that's what's happening with AI
because the large language model
is never going to be smart
it's just going to be really good at
organizing information
and and what it takes for AI to become
smart has not been invented
right
it hasn't been invented nobody knows how
that could happen because we don't even
have a like a concept of what it would
take to make it smart
all we have is this old model which just
makes your search engine and your
organization of data are really really
cool and it can talk to you better so
it's like Siri plus it's like you know a
better Siri basically
so
I would like to submit
that the AI that you're worried about
is the one that hasn't been invented and
nobody knows how to invent it
should you be worried about things that
haven't been invented and nobody knows
even the first part of how to make it
that would be everything
you know I I'm worried about
the pen
because what if it evolves into a laser
that shoots out of every hole
because you know right now right now
it's it's innocent right now there's not
much danger you know unless it pokes you
but what if what if it evolved into a
laser shooting pen
that's what the conversation about AI is
like no it does not evolve into a laser
shooting pen
there might be lasers that could evolve
but a pen doesn't become a laser
all right enough of that
all right um
as you know the reason that ESG and Dei
and CEI and all those racist things that
are being pushed upon organizations the
main reasons that they have to fold to
those things is not because they think
it's right necessarily some probably do
but because there are all these ratings
agencies
that will destroy the reputation of your
company if you're not doing all the
noble and good things
and
I thought to myself well
why are there not
alternative ratings agencies
and why are why are there not ratings
agencies
to rate the other rating agencies
because wouldn't you like to know oh
this agency says you know Tesla is not
woke enough
but wouldn't you like to know that
there's a rating agency
their rates all the rating agencies it
says this rating agency is
what's wrong with that because my
understanding is that it doesn't take
much to be a rating the agency you just
have to say you are one and then see if
you could convince people you are one
right it's not like it's a government
you know licensed role so why not have
like hundreds of them
until they're all useless
you know the problem with the old search
engine before AI
is that if I Googled anything the
problem wasn't that I would get no
results the problem is I'd get too many
and they'd all be all over the place
it'd be like go into the library and
look it through books it would just take
forever
right so
I feel like one way that this ratings
agency thing might go is there might be
so many different agencies
that they all become useless
if you wanted to know what was the
rating you'd look up the agencies to see
what they rated Tesla and one would be
an a
and one would be like a d Plus
and then what do you do
what do you do
so I feel like One Direction that all
this rating agency stuff could go is
more of it until it dies under its own
weight
that could be One Direction because what
I don't think is going to happen is
you'll just have a few ratings agencies
and everybody will just agree that
they're the ones
maybe but I feel like there's no barrier
to entries so there should be lots of
them
um
then we see that one of the ratings
agencies there's a a gay advocacy
advocacy group they just stripped
Anheuser-Busch
of their good rating because they didn't
like Anheuser-Busch
basically came to the pressure about
Dylan Mulvaney
so now you can't make the right happy
because they didn't like you know how
that was treated but now the left is
unhappy because they change their minds
because the pressure from the right do
you think that big companies are
learning that social advocacy is a bad
idea
how many times does a big company need
to just get kneecapped before they say
how about we just stay out of all of
this how about how about you do you
we'll just make money
well we'll just try to be a company for
a change how about that
so
anyway
um
have you noticed that when Democrats
want to get reelected there's something
that they often do
tell me what it is what do Democrats do
and I'm not talking about hoaxes when
they want to get reelected lie more well
okay it wasn't act Republican
they act Republican
and here's the thing it's as if it's as
if Republican or it's as if Democrats
know
that their own policies don't work
because when they need to get reelected
they just suddenly drift into Republican
policies to try to make you not realize
that they never were there so here's a
good example of that
um
Governor Newsom
is
trying to change the the approval
process for getting big projects
approved in the state now a big project
would be you know a big energy project
or a big Dam so anything with water or
energy you can't get anything approved
in California because there's some
process
we'll see the process is what's it
called uh
there's a name for it the California
environmental equality act it's a lot of
law is known as sequa so apparently the
Democrat Governor realizes that I assume
this came from Democrats the Democrats
passed a law that made it impossible to
manage the state because you couldn't
get anything done because you couldn't
get it through this approval
organization so
Newsome is going to try to become Donald
Trump by getting by reducing red tape so
he can get things done
now
how do you justify that I mean he
literally has to become Trump
to save the state
does anybody not notice that
are we supposed to not notice that he
has to adopt a baseline Republican
policy
to save the state because he knows he
knows he's in trouble
right
that's so embarrassing
no that doesn't work the other way does
it
it probably does but I just don't know
examples I'm probably being biased about
this does it work the other way that
Republicans try to turn into Democrats
when they're running for election
maybe they do maybe they do a little bit
maybe they soften they probably soften
on abortion a little bit in some cases
yeah some do
so I guess I guess I'm going to modify
my statement and say it works both ways
all right well here's a little wild card
remember
the best way to predict the future as
Elon Musk reminded us even yesterday
is at the most entertaining outcome is
the most likely
as as determined by a you know external
Observer and I told you if that rule is
true then one thing we should see before
2024
is evidence that the 2020 election was
in fact rigged
now I'm not predicting it based on
evidence
right and I'm not saying it was rigged
I'm not saying it's rigged uh not and
there's no evidence that I'm aware of
but wouldn't it be the most entertaining
what would be more entertaining than
that to find out it actually was rigged
because it would be the the cherry on
the cake of all the other rigging and
impropriety that we've seen
because every time I make this joke
people get quiet do you know the joke I
make about the election
well we know that the following entities
are thoroughly corrupt uh the FBI the
CIA
Congress ego then list the FDA the CDC
all big Pharma we know they're all
corrupt
but aren't we lucky
that all 50 states was separate voting
systems worked perfectly
everything else in the country was
rigged everything
everything that could be rigged was
rigged but boy are we lucky that the
elections were not
and when I say that Democrats just
 run away
because it's the one argument that you
can't you just can't say anything about
that
because because the rejoinder is but
there's no evidence to which I say
absolutely
you're so right about that there is no
evidence
you were right
no argument there
and again aren't we lucky
that everything in the country is
corrupted and we found out for sure
but that
so good on you for calling it right and
calling the only thing that's not rigged
it's the only thing
all right so that's why the most amusing
uh out club would be to find out that it
was
now Kerry lake has apparently arrested
her a case we don't know what the
conclusion is yet
but the question was whether or not they
had done real signature verification or
fake signature verification which one do
you think they proved that real
signature verification was done or that
fake
verification was done
well it turns out
according to Kerry Lakeside
that that they did I know tens of
thousands seventy thousand signatures
that were verified in two seconds
two seconds
so one of the things that Kerry Lake
proved is that the people doing the
signature verification were way faster
than you think
it's just sort of commonsensically I
think seventy thousand how long would
that take human beings to look at each
one and
and I think to myself about two seconds
that sounds about right yeah about two
seconds
so so in order for Kerry Lake to lose
and I don't mean legally but let's say
lose logically you know lose the logical
argument the legal argument might have
some you know legal legal uh loophole
that I don't know about but in terms of
making her case that there was in fact
not really any signature verification
I feel like she's going to land that
because the logs themselves
apparently are Undisputed and they say
they were checked in two seconds
now obviously there's some pushback to
that and I haven't heard it so don't
assume just because you've heard of one
side of it
that there's not another side
because so far every time we've heard
there's an election story there is
another side and it takes away all the
fun
right so don't assume that this is a you
know a slam dunk
but boy the simulation is just screaming
for it isn't it
the simulation seriously wants this to
happen
so we'll see
we'll see
if I were to predict it's going to
happen it would be based entirely on the
most entertaining outcome not on any
evidence not in any evidence
because I don't believe anything on the
internet
all right here's another simulation
alert
as you know Senator Tim Scott has
announced he's going to run as a
Republican
and
I'm going to make a prediction based on
the same
the same phenomenon that reality will be
the most entertaining reality for me
so this will be just personal
I believe that Tim Scott will end up
being Trump's VP choice
here's why
because it will drive me crazy to hear
that the ticket is Trump Scott
and I will be plagued Forever Until the
election because people will think it's
very funny to point out that Scott is my
name as well
and people say well it's about time you
were running on the ticket
and then they will laugh and it will be
funny
so for that reason alone
I'm going to predict that Trump will
pick Tim scottish's running mate
because it's just the weirdest it's the
weirdest most simulation-like outcome
it's just the weirdest
now on top of that
Tim Scott's Kind of Perfect
because you want a vice president who's
serious and substantial
doesn't have scandals you know there's
no negatives that are coming with it uh
but is not as is not as fascinating as
the top of the ticket
perfect
you know I
Tim Scott
is a solid person who you wouldn't mind
having as your president
you know I suppose you're you're mile
mileage might differ if you're a
Democrat but you can imagine him being
president and you can imagine yourself
being comfortable with that so that's a
perfect bet fit not as much wattage as
the president takes care of some of the
the biggest weakness that Trump has
what's Trump's biggest weakness
go what's his biggest weakness yeah
racism so if he runs with a black vice
president they'll still call him a
racist they'll call him and Uncle Tom
but the but the
the attacks won't have the same feeling
it will also set up Tim Scott as an
obvious
person who runs for president after
being a vice president
and if you're black and you just want a
black president which we saw with Obama
you know what do you get 96 of black
Vote or something
um there might be some people who say
you know what that's that's the shortest
path to the next black president
so maybe they like that
Maybe
so I think it would be a
he to me he seems like the most obvious
choice
what do you think of that you got really
quiet when I said that is there any
negative to that
Tim Scott is vice president for Trump is
there any negative to that
it almost feels too obvious doesn't it
it feels like it's just really obvious
yeah
maybe I could see Christy gnome being a
choice as well but Tim scottsy was more
obvious
all right uh do you know the
trigonometry
podcast it's a pretty big deal
it's made a lot of news with some big
interviews apparently they're uh so
they're British based and their Bank
just shut them down
with no explanation
no explanation they just decided to
unbank them
and they just said yeah we I'm sorry we
can't be your bank anymore
it's called The Tide business is the
name of the bank a tide bank or
something tied Business Bank I never
heard of that bank
but
do you think that's good for Tide's
business
I hope not now maybe there's some reason
we don't know about
but as uh Eric Weinstein was pointing
out
um
we do have a re we have a problem with
choke points
banks are a choke point
so the the bad people don't have to go
after everybody they just go after your
bank
and you saw what happened to me with the
choke point right just go after the
publisher
you could take me out of business with
just one choke point that's what
happened
so joke points are a big problem in
politics right now if that's what
happened but we'll keep an eye on
trigonometry wishing him well
all right what do you think of the
DeSantis versus Trump
strategy of saying that the other one
was wrong on the pandemic
do you think that's going to work
so apparently both Trump and DeSantis
are going to exaggerate what they did
and you know maybe exaggerate the other
direction what the other person did so
they both seem to have a claim
that the other one got it wrong
and and I try to follow the argument so
I'm like okay on this date
DeSantis was a little bit
Pro lockdown but on this date he was
anti-lockdown but Trump
he was pro-vaccination but then
not mandatory but then he wasn't against
lockdown and then what about Mass what
they say about Mass you know so I think
it's too complicated
now if it's too complicated
voters will just Retreat to their bias
and back their candidate so I don't
think I don't think it has much punch
what do you think
I think that both of them are going to
be looking at uh sub-optimal
performances
because everybody was sub-optimal in the
pandemic
You could argue that DeSantis was one of
the better ones
but apparently even New York state had a
lower death rate did you know that
that's that's Trump's claim I don't know
if it's true so Trump is claiming that
even New York state did better on death
rates than Florida did but
Florida made a conscious choice to
protect the elderly and let everybody
else live their life
so was that a mistake
was it a mistake to let people live free
knowing of course that the death rate
would be higher
I wouldn't call it a mistake I would
call it a choice
so I don't know I I think neither of
them are going to get traction
I think that we're over the pandemic
we understand that nobody was perfect
and they both I thought they both did
the best they could
under great uncertainty
so you know I told you before the at the
beginning of the pandemic I told you
that I was going to be an easy grader
for all the leaders who got it wrong
because there'd be a lot of people
guessing and they would be getting it
wrong so from the very start I said
let's be a little bit generous on this
one
on this one people are genuinely
guessing
so you don't want to throw your good
leaders under the bus because they
guessed wrong
right now you you could argue there are
things that were more objectively true
when they got wrong but nobody was going
to get everything right that wasn't a
thing
so I tend to not care so much about what
they got wrong
you know they were in the ballpark I
think both Trump and DeSantis were in
the ballpark of my preference
meaning they were struggling to
understand as best they could make the
best decisions they could
they were well-meaning
I don't know I have nothing to complain
about honestly
uh even though it was sub-optable
all right uh Larry Elder has a book
as goes California my mission to rescue
the Golden State and save the nation now
available
um
that feels like an important read
because I think he's right on this you
know as goes California because
California does it is sort of the canary
in the coal mine for the rest of the
country it's like well we're doing this
this year
just wait two years you're going to be
doing it too whatever it is
all right
I saw
it's not a Lawrence Jones referred to
DeSantis As Trump light
what do you think of that framing
DeSantis is Trump light
now this similar to Bill Maher saying
that DeSantis is the tribute band
but here's what I like about calling uh
DeSantis but uh Trump light because it
reminds you of Bud Light
and and Bud Light
is now carrying uh you know some bad
vibes with it
so I'm not sure the first time I said it
when the first time I just said that
DeSantis is Trump light quoting Lawrence
Jones
um did you immediately think of Bud
Light or no
did Bud Light come into your mind or no
because it took it did some of you yes
some of you know
it's kind of an interesting framing
isn't it
because the it says it's as good as
tribute band
although trivia band is really Visual
and you know you can almost hear it
and nobody's ever liked the tribute band
better so that's good but people do like
light beer better
there are people who genuinely like
light beer so
um but I do like the fact that it
Associates it with something that the
base is already biased against
all right so CNN and maybe some some
others from the left are going after
musk so there's a big opinion piece I'm
not even going to tell you who wrote it
because the opinion piece is on CNN are
just such hack jobs
I mean they're just so unprofessional
and poorly written that I'm not even
going to tell you who it was because it
doesn't matter
but
um
is sort of trying to put together a
laundry list of reasons why you
shouldn't trust or like Musk
all right so here's our laundry list
of reasons now remember the laundry list
persuasion
means that you don't have anything
the reason you put them in a list is
that individually none of them would
bother you but if you see them in a list
like whoa that's a lot of smoke there
must be some fire there
all right so here's their beginning with
their little list propaganda
against Musk
uh that he
um apparently agreed to turkey's request
to censor a bunch of critics of the
government
and I guess the choices were that you
know to to not have Twitter in Turkey
during the election
which would have been bad or to do what
a dictator wanted him to do and censor
on their behalf
which is bad
so musk had two choices
one was to stay in business in Turkey
and you know live to fight another day
because it's at least at least that's
some free speech or
to
to go hard and say no turkey you don't
get Twitter there will be no Twitter for
turkey sorry
you don't get any
now how do you know what the right
decision was
you don't really know the right decision
do you you know what happened but you
don't know if he'd made the other
decision
a better thing would have happened it's
completely unknowable
so the first complaint they have about
mosque is that he tried to weigh you
know the benefit of free speech
versus all the other variables and
realized that there was a no-win
situation right there was no good way so
it was either going to be no Twitter in
Turkey which is bad
or to agree to censor which is bad you
just had two bad choices
so if you picked one of the two bad
choices does that means he sucks
or was it just an impossible situation
and he picked one I don't know was it a
good choice or a bad choice I don't know
does it indicate that Elon Musk loves
dictators
no
does it indicate that you know Twitter
is always going to go along with the
dictator no because one of the factors
is that it was right before the election
right because it could have gone a
different way had there not been an
election that was really critical and
and on point at that moment
so
to be it's easy to be the critic but if
you're going to be the critic you have
to say what you would have done
that was the right answer what's the
right answer
you're saying he did the wrong thing now
you tell us what's the right answer
because it wasn't a right answer
but yet they can throw that on the
laundry list and oh yeah well that one
doesn't bother me so much
let's see what else is on the list maybe
when I see it all I'll really be worried
all right next person in the list
is that uh
the most said that George Soros hates
Humanity
and uh that gets very close to the line
of anti-Semitic
it wasn't anti-Semitic
but it reminded them of things that are
right so now you've got two terrible
things that must did he added no win
situation in which he didn't win
that's the first strike against him he
didn't win in a no-win situation with
turkey
and then secondly he made a comment
about an individual which reminded other
people of anti-semitism
it wasn't anti-Semitism because it was
about one person whose actions
seemed to you know suggest that
interpretation according to musk not
according to me
but
all right so you got two of the
sketchiest things in the world but
there's two of them now
if they could only come up with a third
thing
then they'd have a proper little list
then wouldn't they
um
see what else oh so then the third thing
is that when he reinstated thousands of
Twitter accounts they were often racist
and anti-semitic people
as researchers have documented
so
his problem was that he valued free
speech
over how offended you would be by it
which is how Free Speech works
and he said explicitly it's only free
speech like in a real way if you allow
the speech that you don't like
so they managed to say the supporting
Free Speech which necessarily supports
speech you don't like and then he acted
upon it by putting him back on on
Twitter
so now they've got these three terrible
things
he didn't win in a new in a no win
situation in Turkey
he said something about one individual
which reminded somebody else of
something else that was anti-Semitic
and he reinstated people under the First
Amendment principle
and that's it
that's their laundry list and here's the
uh the title of the piece what happened
to Elon Musk
what happened to him
the title is what people are going to
say and they're going to say oh how did
he turn bad well I don't have time to
read that article but it looks like
something something sketches with that
guy
oh my God now is it obvious to you
that they're just trying to take down
his power
because his power is pretty awesome at
the moment yeah
this is not even close to news and now
and I realized it was an opinion piece
but even as an opinion piece it doesn't
belong in the news entity because it's
not news it's just and it's not really
an opinion
this is just a head job to take
somebody's power down is that why you
need CNN to do hip pieces on people how
useful is that
well let's talk about
Ukraine
um
do you remember when we first started
and one of the things that we definitely
weren't going to do
oh we're definitely not going to we
might give Ukraine some help
oh yeah give them some old weapons maybe
some ammunition we weren't going to use
yeah give them give us some memories and
you know maybe some helmets and stuff
whatever
but uh we're definitely not going to
give them any f-16s
I mean
let's not be crazy we're definitely not
going to give them any f-16s because if
we did that we basically would be in a
hot war with Russia
because you know Russia is going to say
we don't care who's flying them
those are your f-16s we're in a war with
you now
so definitely weren't going to do that
no no f-16s
so today's news is that uh by the
um Biden has approved f-16s
so the ukrainians are now uh Learning to
Fly those f-16s
and
I uh
I started to think that the Democrats
led by Biden are doing the same thing to
Putin that they do the Republicans
which is they're just gaslighting the
 out of them
aren't they
the the same technique that they use
domestically which is just you know
propaganda and and gaslighting
and lying and oh we definitely won't do
that before they do it and blaming the
other side of the thing they're doing
it's like every trick they do
domestically against the Republicans
they're doing against Putin
and it's working which of course is why
they do it they're totally gaslighting
Putin and they're doing a good job of it
I don't think they I don't think the
Republicans are good at that
I think the Republicans just say okay is
there a reason for a war
yes no
no no
reason for a war all right how about
let's not have one
is there a reason for a war oh well then
let's just like win the war
but the Republicans are all this Mind
Games it's just like a complete
propaganda mind game
you know the whole thing
so anyway I don't believe anything that
comes out of Ukraine it's all lies damn
lies damn lies anything else happening
on this quiet Saturday they're missing
these stories oh yeah Putin banned Obama
from traveling to Russia why in the
world would Obama travel to Russia
was that a thing
are you telling me that Obama was
planning a was Obama planning a trip to
Russia now
or was that just preemptive
does anybody know he wasn't actually
going to go to Russia right
during the current situation
now it must have been just some generic
thing
he's just calling attention to Obama
yeah and it's probably smart
we provoke this war that's true how many
people think the United States is
primarily responsible for the war in
Ukraine
primarily responsible
I do
to me that seems obvious
you know the public information seems to
support that narrative completely yeah
it looks like we did it and it looks
like we didn't get any gain for it
did we gain anything or is there
anything we could gain
I see no potential for uh winning
do you
I think we I think we screwed the pooch
on this since 2014 and earlier
I think we've just been getting this
wrong the whole way
yeah and earlier I mean we've been doing
nothing but trying to overthrow Putin
and threatening his borders
what the hell is he supposed to do
yeah
I I'd love to know the secret back story
with Putin
I feel as if
there's something that we don't know
about Putin or maybe what we did maybe
it's something we don't know about the
United States but there's something
about the whole
Putin's story that got us to this place
that didn't make sense
and the only the only way to explain it
I can think of is that the you know the
military-industrial complex
is just doing whatever it takes to have
more war
that follow the money is the only thing
that's completely working everything
else looks like it doesn't make sense
but if you follow the money it just
everything
suddenly
is perfectly ordered
you know you can see the whole field
there's there's no questions left
yes he considers Ukraine part of Russia
but but there are genuine
uh genuine reasons why he needs Ukraine
as a buffer
all right
um
what if Russia's most valuable most
valuable threat yeah
they're the most valuable threat that's
an interesting way to put it
uh was Scott Barnes is saying
John are you so somebody who's Scott
Barnes
are you referring to me incorrectly and
also not understanding any of my
positions while criticizing me or is
there a person named Scott Barnes that
you're speaking
were you drinking this morning
all right so something about Robert
Barnes I guess
all right
um
um
some mentalities passed down from the
sources to the sons Maybe
Google is Scott
Google what
that never helps
all right
um
so was that a comment about me did
somebody think I was changing my opinion
I'm just trying to see if somebody was
drunkenly criticizing you or not
yeah how can you drink all day if you
don't start in the morning that's a good
point
all right
yeah I don't think I changed my opinion
so you must been talking about Barnes
I don't know
Barnes is an idiot so I don't talk I
don't talk about him
um
all right here's John
Scott you're taking exactly the position
of the people you criticized for being a
RT Stooges on Russia I'm taking exactly
the position of the no I'm not
no yeah you're hallucinating that
nothing like that's happening
I have no idea what you're talking about
now you're hallucinating
all right that's all for YouTube I will
talk to you
tomorrow in the morning
uh don't drink for breakfast that's my
advice to you your comments will be much
better
