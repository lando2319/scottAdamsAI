do do
do do do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
let's take it up a notch shall we
you ready buckle up all you need is a
cup of micro glass attacker Chelsea
starting again team geographlask uh
vessel Liberty guide fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Epico
I hope you are prepared
if you were still Brewing shame on you
it was time to sip
next time
a little more punctuality okay
well there's a big old storm coming to
California it's category one
category one
can you wake me up when it's a three but
apparently it's moving the other
direction so
um there might actually be some damage I
believe some people are evacuating
because of rain but it doesn't look like
it could be the worst the worst it could
be so we'll probably just get some water
that's what I think
um how many of you would like to see me
give a radio interview
at uh 4 20 p.m Pacific time tonight
say yes say yes yes well many of you
just beg you for it yes
um okay okay I'll do it I'll do it
all right I said I'd do it I said I'd do
it I'll do it I promise I will
so tonight 4 20 Pacific time that would
be 7 20 eastern time I'll be with uh
Joel Pollock on Breitbart radio if
you're saying to yourself how do I
listen to that just Google it
um Breitbart radio Joe Pollock and or
you can look at my tweet retweet it to
this morning you'll find us anyway
um you might know that I have not been
doing too many interviews
but in conjunction with my book reframe
your brain which is available so far
only on Kindle because Amazon has
unspecified possibly technical problems
that are preventing the publication of
my physical book The book's done is
ready to go
um but in the independent publishing
let's say pipeline
there seems to be some kind of a delay
for my property
it's an unspecific technical hard to
explain we just don't know what's going
on it's going to take us a little while
to look into it kind of a problem
that's the kind of problem now if you're
saying to yourself Scott
this is clearly some kind of
messing around with you probably not
probably not it's probably just the way
everything works let me put this in
context
pretty much every step of the
independent publishing hits some kind of
a problem like there's a password that
doesn't work there's you know there's
just something you can't do and every
one of the processes you have to kind of
crawl through it and correct and adjust
and you know you know you basically you
just you're just adjusting as you go
it's all about adjusting as you go
so
in the context of nothing working just
sort of in general
the most likely explanation is they're
busy or there's some technical problem
because I've heard a lot of other people
have had issues that that don't sound
like they're political
now let me give you an example of how
bad I'm going to call this the national
incompetence problem
how many of you would agree
that there appears to be a national
incompetence problem
to do anything just most basic services
let me give you an idea how bad it is
all right this is how bad it is I did
something really stupid this week
I want you to could you do me a favor
and mock me for my stupidity over this
just listen to how bad this is I had to
take my car in for service
and I knew that you know there might be
some real issues I was driving kind of
funny so I don't know exactly what the
problem is but you know it couldn't be
one of those expensive ones
here's how stupid I am and please mock
me get ready get ready I took my car
into the dealer for service
so ashamed
on a Thursday
go ahead
go ahead
I know I know no I deserve it I deserve
it I took my car in for service on
Thursday
it's the dumbest thing everybody ever
did
do you think I got my car back before
the weekend of course not
of course not so there's an extra two
days but that's not even my point
the the dealer I don't have a problem
with the dealer so in this story the
dealer is you know it's just stuff that
takes more than a day
so there's nothing wrong with the dealer
I brought it in on a Thursday
when I knew I wouldn't have it for the
weekend unless I rented a car
now you're probably going to ask
yourself let's see if you know the
answer to this why did I not rent a car
and while why will I instead spend four
to five days trapped in my house I mean
I could Uber if I want to
but why did I not rent a car go ahead
you tell me it's not because of money no
why did I not get one
not insurance no
yep somebody got it
under today's current situation
I could not imagine literally I can't
imagine it
renting a car
without trouble
I couldn't even imagine it I imagine
that I would go in there and they'd say
uh we don't have the car that you uh you
reserved I thought at the very least it
would turn it into a Seinfeld episode I
know what Uber is you don't have to say
Uber every comment
can we can we stipulate I've heard of
uber
everybody you can stop yelling Uber at
me I've heard of it it's like a car
service where you can take place you can
go places right okay I got it
okay you don't have to yell turo at me I
got it
I I don't think I don't think I'm
getting through I don't I don't seem to
be getting through the lift now you're
just really funny apparently I'm not
getting through with this point
no the the the simple Act of renting a
car
If This Were five years ago you know
what I would have done I would have just
rented a car
I would have run to the car and I
wouldn't have worried that it wouldn't
work
I actually worry that if I allocate my
half a day or whatever to
you know going in and picking up a car
that it just won't work
you know like I won't be able to rent it
my credit card will be declined you know
I'll be on some do not rent list some
damn thing I just don't think there's
enough competence left in the system
that it ever make sense to take on a new
thing if you can avoid it like if your
other if your other possibility is just
to stay home and be unhappy just stay
home and be unhappy
sometimes all right don't don't follow
my advice about anything
all right let's talk about uh my other
favorite topic you know I've been saying
for years that the future is building
cities from scratch uh NPCs you may yell
at 15-minute cities now go
yell 15 minutes say no no 15 minutes at
least oh
okay this has nothing to do with
15-minute cities
but you need to yell it so please do
go ahead
wef
go ahead
and also you need to yell uh tiny homes
tiny homes so this has nothing to do
with tiny homes
but you need to yell it I know you do
tiny homes tiny homes go ahead in the
comments
I've been here before
anyway there's a City built from scratch
in Kaya
that's the pronunciation that's probably
exactly right on I think
in Guatemala
now what's interesting about it is they
actually set out to build a city from
scratch but what's interesting is they
built it like
sort of in the architecture of more
traditional older looking stuff but you
know with the modern twists and I saw
some video of it looked amazing looks
amazing and it is the streets are are
pedestrians Now cars I don't know that
that makes it a 15-minute City but if
you need to yell about how you're
unhappy that the cities could be
convenient
go ahead and do it
so this is uh one example that
apparently people are happy with and it
came out really well
uh but that's the future the future is
cities from scratch and there's almost
no way around it
because it'll be the biggest industry
that everybody's you know agrees we need
and people who want to live there
and there will be lots lots of different
ones will will some of these cities be
15-minute cities that Klaus Schwab will
take all your freedom and your security
and your privacy Maybe
but others will be something else
all right these Hunter Biden plea deal
we're finding out more about it Politico
is trying to spin it as uh late payments
that nobody goes to jail for being late
on their taxes you just work out a
payment plan and it would be very
unusual to go to jail just because you
were late on your taxes
so that's what it was right that was the
problem
was the problem that Hunter was just
laid on his taxes but now he's paid now
he's paid
yeah you know I was once late on my
taxes too
so I mean same kind of crime now in my
case I did not set up a series of
international
shell companies to hide the fact that
what that I was late I didn't do that I
just I think I forgot or something
I may have forgotten to pay a estimated
payment once and I just paid my penalty
and paid my money and I didn't go to
jail
but you know
I also didn't have a series of shell
companies to run it through so it would
be hidden from everybody
so
there's that
um there there of course is some
pushback
so lawyers never agree on anything some
people saying oh it's not that big a
deal nobody would have gone to jail for
the specific things the hunter did
others say uh this is not late
this is hiding money from the IRS about
the most illegal thing you could
possibly do
well
you know potato potato
but there is evidence that the
investigation only went forward because
of the whistleblowers
so pretty much everything you thought
about everything was true
on the hunter Biden story everything you
suspected seems to be true
it's pretty it's a pretty interesting
model because sometimes you see stories
where like you crave if you watch the
Ukraine story you're like
I don't know that might be true but no
way to know
yeah maybe probably not
but you see the hunter story and now
there's a pattern that's developed
that no matter how much doubt there is
about the story
turns out it's true
there's nothing you can say about them
because they just all turn out to be
true all right I would like I would like
to challenge that see if I'm wrong do a
fact check on me
name something that Hunter Biden has
been accused of or Joe Biden in relation
to Hunter Biden
name something that has not been
demonstrated to be true Beyond any real
doubt can you name anything he was
accused of that is not
now the the the paintings as a way to
launder influence
wouldn't say it's proven
it's not proven proven it's just obvious
you don't need to prove anything about
the paintings that's that's that's
exactly what it looks like on the
surface
all right yeah it's pretty consistent if
Hunter is accused of it
apparently that's usually going to turn
out to be true
although he's innocent until the proven
guilty in terms of the law
like everybody else
well Wall Street Journal again is
hammering on how China's economy is
going in the toilet their 40-year boom
is over
they have plenty of empty buildings so
China's big problem is empty buildings
uh and over here we've got a lot of
homeless but they're not homeless
because they don't have homes they're
homeless by choice
for the most part probably 90 percent
um
what do you think about
China's
let's say
let's say their chances for the future
there are at least two things three
things that the United States has going
for it that our adversaries or let's say
competitors can't match
number one we have the option
which we have not used of filtering our
immigration better
in other words we can avoid the
demographic crash by becoming the only
country that people are fighting to get
into and we're taking the you know the
ones with the best potential
to be good citizens usually education
would be the top thing do they have a
skill
now do you think China could ever match
Us in Immigration of you know sucking up
the best people from every country now
do you think Russia could ever match Us
in what we could do with immigration no
now here's the weirdest take you're ever
going to hear on immigration
our complete failure to guard our border
is in the short term which might be
several years
terrible
would you agree
that on on net there are benefits of
immigration even illegal immigration has
benefits you know people get jobs Etc
but would you agree that so far like the
last few years it's more of a net
negative because it's just out of
control
but watch this
if you were in another country
and you knew that all of the other
countries seem to be badasses about
immigration
and you do that the United States was
willing to hurt itself
to accept you
the United States was willing to hurt
itself fairly massively to accept
immigration
now you can say oh it's politics it's
incompetence it's it's this it's you
know it's commonly it's not doing the
job that's all it is but I'm just saying
how how would it be received by the rest
of the world
so imagine imagine you're in India
you grew up in India you just went
through the ITT system you're one of the
top technical young people in the world
because you just went through a system
that produces them
and you're saying to yourself where do I
go
do you go to China let's say China said
you're welcome and and let's say they
put together a an immigration attraction
thing to get technical people would you
say that I will be welcomed with open
arms in China no you wouldn't feel that
way how about Russia
even if they said they would welcome you
would you would you feel like that's the
place you want to go
maybe not so much
now imagine that you had been listening
to the news about America and you found
out we had these Sanctuary cities
and that even though we fought about you
know what is the right level of
immigration the net effect
was that we were the most accidentally
accidentally one of the most welcoming
countries for immigration
and we remain
I would say the Melting Pot example for
the world even with all of our problems
we have somewhat accidentally created a
situation from the Statue of Liberty all
the way through Sanctuary cities that
America is a place that has built into
its DNA a a belief that immigration is
Central to our existence and our let's
say our experience
which is not to say let everybody in all
the time right we're not talking about
the way we're doing it I'm talking about
what was somebody in another country
feel about the United States when
deciding where to bring their high
levels of skills
to employ it for the rest of their lives
I don't think anybody can match us
I I think we'll be maybe in better shape
than Europe they got a little bit
overrun so Europe's got their own
problems but in the United States we we
still have a recoverable situation I
don't know that they do in France or
Great Britain might not be recoverable
but in the United States it is and I
think that if we got let's say a
Republican president
save a fake just to pick one and he said
immigration is good you just got to make
sure you're getting the right people
clamp down the Border put in some real
processes to bring in the best of the
best
who competes with that
so under that scenario China and Russia
are not going to have access to high
tech at least not directly
so we'll have the better Tech better
microchips which means that we'll have
ai in a functional form much better than
any other country
which means that we'll be able to
attract the best you know immigrants
that are really additive
there's no way you can compete with that
and the most important thing is that we
won't have a demographic collapse
because we'd be bringing in people to as
replacements
yeah
we would probably have to eliminate the
cartels as just part of the plan but
Vivek will do that
you have the vacuum is talking about
slamming their cartels
having real immigration to attract the
right people all the right stuff
there's something shaping up here that
would make America the only superpower
and would would be really the jewel
in in the world more so than it ever has
been if it ever has been
but well there's a story in the New York
Post about the so-called Squad you know
aoc's group of politicians
that their big old Hypocrites because
AOC and the squad spent 1.2 million in
campaign cash on private security
despite calls to defund the police
now you're expecting that I'm going to
agree with the New York Post and say
hypocrisy
hypocrisy right
or if you know me better you know that
I'm going to say this is an analogy
the New York Post is making an analogy
between police and private security
is that fair
no
did AOC call for ending private security
for public figures
no she did not call for ending private
security for public figures
now she did call for something that's
you know as dumb as that but not at
least it's not inconsistent so yes she
she certainly wanted her own safety but
don't pretend that public figures have
the same security concerns as average
citizens average citizens could have
worse problems depending where they live
or no problems at all if they live where
I live but
uh AOC has real security problems
and she has the right to have security
and I don't want anything to happen to
her so yes I'm 100 in favor of her doing
what she needs to do to protect herself
I don't think that's up for a debate
now separately
do you want your police to be defunded
well nobody has a better alternative to
that
uh but you don't really need to bring
the private security in there I realize
it's like a political oh I gotcha
but don't we have plenty of things to do
gotcha with a squad
do you need this one I mean this one
just seems like just so small ball
politics
but I get it it works
so I try to I try to avoid the hypocrisy
lines you know it's the easiest thing to
do oh they said this but they did this
that's never an interesting story
it's just a political Spin and you've
seen it once and you're like ah
all right uh I forgot about this but the
attorney general for Montana I think it
was uh Austin Knudsen
actually pushed through and got made
into law a ban on Tick Tock in the state
and I'm not talking about a ban for
state workers which you've seen in other
places government workers but a band you
just couldn't have it in the state now I
don't know how it's I supposedly
the app stores could adjust for the the
state somehow so maybe that's practical
to do but
um I love the fact that he did it and he
got away with it
so I just want to say his name so you've
heard it people say he's you know
angling for higher office somewhere if
he is good for him because you did
something useful all right let's say his
name again uh attorney general Austin
Newton so if you hear this voice if you
hear that name in the future
just remember he did one good thing I
don't know what else he did but he did
this one good thing
and do you think that the news is
covering this correctly no no the news
will still say stuff like but Tick Tock
said they would put their private data
in American some American managed
company
that's not really the problem it's the
brainwashing
it's not just the privacy and every time
you see the news focus on the Privacy
part you know that that's propaganda or
they just don't know the news themselves
you know but it could mean that the
people they're telling the news know the
news better than the people we're
telling it
that's sometimes the case
all right
uh I saw one report I don't know if this
is true but that Newsome is dispatching
the National Guard to tackle the drug
situation in San Francisco
they might confirm that
that Newsome is sending or will send the
National Guard
for San Francisco
because I don't I don't think so
but maybe
maybe but let's say if it is true and I
would put a big question mark on that it
feels a little I don't know
I feel like it would be bigger news or
something but I only saw it in one
Outlet
so
this would be if if it's true and that's
a real big if in this this story I would
say that
it's another example that you have to
become Trump to run against them
you have to become Trump to run against
them that's a problem
you basically have to adopt his policies
after saying they were bad policies
forever
because once you're in the National
stage you just look ridiculous
you know it's just more obvious that
Trump was right about some stuff the
immigration for example
um
Alex Jones says he has some Source from
in TSA that says masks are coming back
as a requirement
now
next story
if you argue about this
you're in the wrong fight
it's just no
now we're done
we're moving to the next story it's just
now
no
not no maybe not know for a little while
not a little bit yes just know
no
all right
um
did I mention that my book reframed me
brain is number one in the happiness
category on Amazon so number one book to
give you happiness and it probably is
number one book in hypnosis even though
it's reframes I present them in the
context of as a professional hypnotist
you know telling you what works about
them so it's not it isn't teaching you
hypnosis per se except in the specific
form of putting reframes into your own
your own Brave and other peoples
and it's number one in personal
transformation in other words personal
growth or success so it's number one in
all three categories that um
are the ones that matter
now don't get too excited being number
one in in your category doesn't mean
you're number one in the world but it's
also not even available except in Kindle
so this is the kind of book where I
would expect a lot of people are going
to wait for the soft cover which could
drop any minute
um
but it's because you're going to want it
as a reference it's sort of a book that
you're going to read it and then go back
to it a bunch of times like oh what was
that what was that reframe I remember
so lives are already being changed
um the the reviews are crazy
they're just so good
people are finding their entire lives
just
re reprogrammed you know just with a few
uh reframes
so I know that I know that these claims
seem wildly unlikely
but you have to read read the reviews
yourself it was written to have that
impact and people are saying it has that
impact
all right RFK Jr
had some uh pretty provocative things to
say about REM deserveer and about Tony
fauci
so this is RFK JR says Tony fauci knew
that REM deserveer would kill you
now what do I say about
people knew
there's a little bit of mind reading
right a little bit of mind reading but
if he can back it up with say a document
or some other evidence then then I'm
going to listen to it so I don't know if
he has other evidence
but I'm always uncomfortable and you
should be too whenever you hear somebody
say somebody else knew something
often is true
but it gets into that mind reading
category that you you need to ask more
questions when somebody says that so I'm
not comfortable just knowing
that RFK JR says Tony fauci knew
something
now he may be right and I would say he
has a high likelihood of being right but
I need a little more than that I'm not
going to go just with somebody thinks
somebody knew something that's that's a
little weak uh but RFK Jr I find quite
credible in doing his homework and
research and he certainly knows this
topic inside out so maybe he does know
maybe maybe RFK Jr does know what Tony
fauci knows about this specific thing I
wouldn't rule it out
but it just makes me uncomfortable when
I see the Mind reading-ish stuff
um
and the
the ideas that REM Desir has some side
effects
that would affect things like kidneys in
heart Etc and that people having kidney
problems
it would be a weird virus that killed
you with your kidneys but REM deserveer
according to RFK Jr might have a side
effect that would be you know sort of
right on the nose for that side effect
so
how bad is it
Now isn't there also a rumor maybe it's
confirmed you'll have to you have to
fact check business was Anthony fauci
did he have a financial interest in rem
deserver at the time of the pandemic
financial interest
because I've read that he did but I
don't know that you can depend on any
reporting on this domain
yeah I'm going to say I've seen reports
of it but I don't know that I would not
personally I would not Resort that as
fact
yeah but maybe it's reported well I'll
just say it's reported that way I'm
going to stop short of saying fact
because it's the sort of thing I'm not
sure anybody knows for example would
would anybody know if he had sold this
stock before the pandemic
would we know that
I just worry that we don't know because
it's not exactly public information all
right
so again
I'm going to call out the incredible
benefit we're seeing from the campaign
yeah imagine imagine if people have just
said well it looks like it's going to be
Biden versus Trump
you know we'll just live with it
but that's not what happened several
candidates decided that they not only
had a chance to fake has a real chance
but that they had something to say
Vivek is as much about what he's saying
as the fact that he's running
he's saying stuff that is reorienting
how you feel about stuff how you think
about it he's reframing the hell out of
us he's really modifying and improving I
would say I'd say he's improving the
philosophical opinions on the right
because have I ever told you the good
writing
I refer to it as
saying what you were thinking by saying
it better than you were thinking it
that's what Vivek does all day long he
says what you're already thinking sort
of
but you had not thought of it that well
and then when he puts it in a sentence
you say that's it that that's the
sentence I wish that sentence had been
in my head
now I've taught you in my book reframe
your brains just Downton Kindle I taught
you that putting words in somebody's ads
is how you reprogram people
we think in terms of words that's why
the llms produce something that looks
like intelligence
because our internal thought process
depends on words and how they fit
together and we imagine that that's our
thinking but really it's just word
patterns that we've seen before and what
we've been exposed to
so when Vivek puts a different word
pattern into your head and he reframes a
topic you're being reprogrammed
he's actually upgrading your software
because if you if you used to say
if you used to say whatever let's say
DeSantis said about a topic then maybe
you had sort of a corporate e you know
his version of saying it but if you
replace that with of a vague sentence
especially if you remember the actual
sentence you're reprogramming yourself
to a higher level of
argument you know you could debate
better
using vivek's words and then someone
else's words
true story
so uh
so you know Larry Elder is doing great
things promoting his beliefs that the
family unit has to be strengthened to
fix just about everything
and you're seeing RFK Jr just ripping
the lid off of you know the line from
every part of society
love that
those are those are three candidates who
are really making the difference no
matter what happens
I don't think I could have more respect
for those three candidates than I do
I mean I have maximum respect because
they're doing the I hate to say doing
the work they're doing productive things
even if they don't win and certainly a
few of them don't expect to win
so and I just want to say something
about uh
Larry Elders take you know the family
unit and keeping the father there is
important I would agree with everything
he says about that
but
I would argue that maybe things have
changed and not just in how we
financially reward people for not having
a father uh but I think we're we're in a
situation where I don't think we can go
back
so it's not that having a family unit
doesn't produce better results it seems
to very clearly
but if you can't go back to it in other
words if we're if we're on a one-way
journey and you just can't go back
because for whatever reason and I don't
think it's just Financial
um well I'm just going to say it
all right I didn't want to say it but
I'm just going to say it
the reason people don't stay married is
that we suck
that's it
that's it people suck
we're not people that you should marry
and stay married to we're just not not
the men not the women
the men are not worth staying with and
the women are not we're staying with
they're just not worth it
now I'm not talking about any individual
and I'm not talking about my life
because I'm a rich guy nothing applies
you know my rich guy getting married in
divorce is not like yours
right you all know that I can afford to
get married I could afford to get
divorced
so it's different it's different but if
if a divorce is the difference between
poverty and making it
you know that's a whole different world
and in that world the benefit of getting
married
just isn't there because people suck
I do believe that people are worse
people than they've ever been
just in general
people are worse than they've ever been
to each other in terms of what it would
take to be a partner for marriage and we
I feel like we can't say that out loud
because you know somebody's going to
turn it racist of course
somebody's going to turn it into sexism
of course but you didn't hear me say
that right
I didn't say it's you know limited just
one group because it's not I didn't say
it's you know one gender is the bad one
because they're not
we've just become terrible people
so how do you fix that
so I think I think the Larry Elder
solution of strength the strengthening
the families is good as a concept as
great as you know maybe a end point or
something
but I don't know how to get there
you can't tell me that marrying somebody
who you know is not going to find me a
good marriage partner is works for me
and keep in mind I'm talking about
myself right I'm not I'm not saying
you're bad and I'm awesome
I've been divorced twice
do you think I would be divorced twice
if somebody really really liked being
married to me
I don't think so
honestly if I were a better deal
somebody would be married to me by now
probably and we'd be happy but
apparently I'm not a good deal
and you know I'm at least transparent
about it
all right um
you know I snore so it's hard it's hard
to be in a relationship when you snore
that's one of the things people don't
talk about
they don't talk about how much snoring
makes it impossible to be in a
relationship
uh you you can act like it's not like oh
that's just a detail but it's not not
just a detail I would bet this snoring
is 20 of divorces
that's my estimate snoring is 20 of
divorces now that's that doesn't mean
they'll say that it just means you end
up in separate bedrooms and then it all
goes to hell
so nobody plans it that way
all right
um yeah I've done I've had my sinuses
operated on it doesn't make a difference
I've had my septum DVA septum
um
also so I've had two surgeries to fix my
general sinus situation
no difference
no difference
but very painful surgeries but no
difference
I do breathe better though
what was I talking about uh oh so I I
love the Larry Elder thing but I think
he needs to go back a level and find out
what's wrong at the base he's definitely
on point about something being economic
but there's a much bigger thing we've
all become people who are not worth
marriage
that's a big problem
right now here's why here's part of the
reason we've become
um
part of the reason that we've become
people we don't want to marry is because
we don't have roles
when people had roles you could respect
anybody who did their role right now you
could say it was sexist that's not the
argument I'm saying that when the male
female roles were clear
you could respect the other person for
doing the role and even if maybe the
lust dissipated you'd say to yourself my
God I can't live without that
like that's that's a partner
that's somebody who values the promise
as much as the you know the day-to-day
lust and happiness
so
yeah I think the the loss of Rome uh
defined Role Models was simultaneously
amazing for some number of women
amazing for some number of men
amazing for some number of lgbtq that
you know maybe got more freedom in that
deal
but it destroyed the system
very good for a lot of people
individually
but it destroyed the system
so I think we have to figure out how to
restore the system
in the context of we're not so good to
each other that we want to marry each
other these days we don't add enough
value
somebody asked me recently you know if
I'd want to get married again
do you know what my answer is
why
what would that give me
what what possible benefit would that be
I couldn't even think of one it has
nothing to do with any individual I may
or may not fall in love with I just
don't see any benefit to it
what's the benefit loyalty
do you think I could get some loyalty
no no because we don't really live in
that world anymore and that's not a
statement of women this is not a
statement about women
you can't buy loyalty you can't find it
we just sort of live in a cheater
society and uh if people don't cheat
they might want to change partners
yeah now marriage would be ridiculous in
my specific situation somebody said it
more generally why would a rich person
ever get married
there's not much reason
there really isn't
all right
um I can tell you why I did it
I got married for the benefit of the
person I was marrying
I mean I was in love in both cases
totally in love but to me the marriage
was only for the benefit of children you
know step kids and it just made somebody
else happier but that's why I did it
because that felt like my role right my
role was to keep people
you know safe
all right Mark Cuban was tweeting at
Elon Musk over this big issue of whether
whether blocking will be allowed on
Twitter in the future let's call it X
and Elon Musk who said that blocking is
going to go away Mark Cuban had some
things about to say about the algorithm
so there are two things going on one is
about blocking and then Mark Cuban's
conversation about whether Elon Musk has
too much influence over the content
now when I saw let's talk about them
individually so let's talk about the
algorithm first so Mark Cuban steak was
that uh Twitter or X is now a reflection
of one person's sensibilities I hope I'm
summarizing that correctly
and I I commented back to Mark Cuban and
said I'm not seeing
I'm not seeing the effect of that you
know what what exactly makes you think
that it's become you know an Elon Musk
sort of thing and that he he responded
by showing the Twitter guy I guess
there's a Twitter document let's call it
X that explains how their algorithm
works
it is hilarious to read
if you want a good laugh you should read
the X document that explains how their
algorithm works
let's just say it's complicated
there's so many so many jargony
buzzwords in it you really can't tell
what it is it's as close to being a
hundred percent non-transparent as
anything could be
wall is trying to be transparent
so that the point of it is to show you
what they're doing but because they have
to use such you know generic jargony
words as it's just so dense with jargon
you really can't tell what it is yeah no
human could read that it's not because
I'm not an engineer it's not because I'm
you know not an expert in the field it's
just written that no nobody could
understand in detail what it's doing or
not doing
but I saw one phrase there that said
that uh
let's see what was the phrase on the the
X document it said they would seek Fair
balance
of you know contents from different
sources
that's actually the that was the term
used in The X documents
that they would seek Fair balance
what's that tell you
do uh do computers and AI do they know
how to figure out what's fair
how do you determine what's fair
that no there's no objective standard
for fair
because it doesn't just mean you know
the numbers
right it's not about just the numbers
it's about a judgment
fair is only subjective
so if the Twitter algorithm
has an important component in which
somebody or something
is determining what a fair balance is of
content from different sources
that can only be humans
now it might be the humans who you know
set it up and then they walk away but
it's set up by the humans
some human had to say I'm going to tweak
this or put this filter in because in my
my opinion or maybe some few people's
opinions this is what Fair looks like
would it be fair
to have just as much content from
something that's obviously conspiracy
trash
versus something that might have some
credibility
would it be fair that you get the same
amount of it
depends right if you're Alex Jones you'd
say that is fair because you can't tell
what's real and what's not
you know maybe he'd say that
right if you're somebody else you say
that's crazy why would you let you know
some 4chan conspiracy theory get the
equal weight with a you know a
respectable publication
so fair is so completely subjective that
I had to immediately fold my argument
and agree with Mark Cuban that we can
never know what's happening with the
algorithm but we can know for sure that
if Elon Musk doesn't like it he'll
change it
now that doesn't mean that we're already
seeing sort of the Elon Musk version of
reality it just means
it has to happen over time
and as Cuban said
Elon Musk won't always be alive and
always running it
somebody else might have to be the
let's say the uh
the benevolent dictator
I've often said the best form of
government by far the best form of
government would be a brilliant
uh benevolent dictator
because the dictator part gets you you
know past all the nonsense of arguing
about stuff the brilliant part gets you
good Solutions or at least somebody who
knows you know to test things before
they Implement them that's that's pretty
good
um
and the benevolent means that that
person is brilliant and working for your
interests
now we actually have something that
feels like that to me
you've got the brilliant part Elon Musk
you've got the benevolent part which I
actually believe I believe he's I
believe he really wants free speech in
his bones I think that's completely real
but that's my opinion
I don't know you know if he had some
secret evil agenda would I know it no
okay I read minds
but it feels to me like an ideal
situation that's also temporary so I'm
going to agree with Mark Cuban no matter
what you think of Elon and I have a high
opinion
he's not going to be there forever
but Twitter won't always be the same
forever either so by the by the time
somebody else runs it maybe everything
else has changed you know maybe there's
a whole different AI platform or
something
so
I'd keep an eye on that but be aware in
my opinion there's no such thing as an
algorithm that is not biased
and if you had one you couldn't make a
business model out of it
in other words bias in the design of the
algorithm is unavoidable
so
you know my response to Mark Cuban he
certainly made his point yeah the the
way the algorithm is you can't avoid the
fact that the owner of the company is
going to get what he or she wants
that's a good that's a good solid
point
but
we don't know if we're seeing it yet
and I can't think of any model that
would be better
can you you know the the obvious thing
you think is like oh let's get rid of
all moderation
do you think that would work
do you think you could build a platform
with no moderation
no do you think you could have a
platform in which you're not doing a lot
of fact checking
and that works out okay
no no that's not going to work out okay
there are no Solutions
so before you criticize the way it is
just remember you're not comparing it to
anything you're comparing it to some
imaginary thing in your mind in which
there's both no censorship
and it works out fine
that's not a possibility
that is not even slightly a possibility
human beings will exploit every
opportunity to be terrible
so what's happening now sort of
dovetailing this is that so Elon Musk
wants to take away the block feature
and people are asking me Scott what do
you think about this and here's my
opinion
um I'm one of many millions of Twitter
users
personally removing the block feature
for me and my very specific situation of
a you know million followers and I talk
about politics and people hate me and
people love me and they're all going to
be fighting it out in the comments
in my very specific situation removing
the blocking is all bad
but that's not my opinion of whether you
should do it
because I'm just one person
and I'm an elite
at least in terms of Twitter users I'm
an elite Twitter user because I have a
million followers
should Elon Musk
modify his his rules and his features to
satisfy people like me
if it's at the expense of everybody else
and the answer is I don't think so I'd
love to tell you he should satisfy me
and let the rest of you you know who
have small accounts you know fend for
yourself
uh but I don't think that's the way you
run anything
I I think I think not now I'll go
further and say if I had as many
followers as Elon Musk I wouldn't care
about blocking
do you understand that if I had uh 20
million followers
I wouldn't care about blocking do you
know why if you've got 20 million
followers you're not looking at comments
you wouldn't spend a minute looking at
comments because there would be a
million of them
what are you going to do block three of
them
oh there's I've got 300 000 people
saying I'm a Nazi I'll block three of
them ah
but I can actually block
100 of my trolls without much effort on
any given day there might be fewer than
five
you know I click things five times a day
and I feel good when I click it
so my experience is unique there's this
little zone of influencers
you know some somewhat in the size of my
accounts let's say
a quarter million to million and a half
and there's lots of
for that group of people
it's all bad
the the removing blocking for us Tiny's
tiny little sliver of users is all bad
and there's no way to argue that
does everybody agree
that just for our personal enjoyment is
just all bad
now whether that and I've said it before
that I use blocking for mental health
that's literally true I'm not making
like a weird analogy or anything no my
actual physical state of mind
is improved by blocking and I can feel
it immediately
and the inability to block would bother
me all day long if something just sat
there and I couldn't do anything about
it so even though blocking doesn't make
other people not see it so much it makes
me feel good
so I would say that my mental health
would absolutely no doubt about it
suffer and that muting would not be
nearly as satisfying
that's my first take however you know
what I say about things that can be
tested
I should not have an opinion because it
could be tested it can be reversed
so if you can test it
and you just find out did it work for me
did it work for most people but not me
I'd like to know
so I would love Elon Musk to show the
rest of the country
how decisions are made
first he said I'm going to do this thing
but you have to know in the back your
head and I'd like I'd like to hear them
say it directly but you know he's
thinking this this is one where mind
reading is easy
because everybody's smart thinks the
same way
yeah if you can test it and if it's
reversible which software is
test it
so I'm not going to say yes or no just
give it a test if it works for everybody
but me I'll say go do it you know I'm
not I'm not your boss if it works for
you I would be happy for you
uh honestly I worry that I would quit
using X
because you know if I have to deal with
Ben Garrison comics on my timeline again
I don't know if I'd stay
I honestly don't
because that would be it would make me
feel bad every time I logged on
but by you know blocking the people who
said that I don't see it
would muting do as well
I doubt it
but I'd be willing to see
all right
um
uh let's see what else has happened so
the news is that uh DeSantis is barely
trying these days there's a clip in
which he's taken a little bit in a
context I would say uh unless you you
said quote unless you're kissing uh
you're talking about Trump he says
unless you're kissing his rear end
they'll call you a rhino
and then he referred to quote listless
vessels who follow whatever comes down
the pike on Truth social every morning
and people said
um are you running to get those votes or
to alienate Republicans
it feels like exactly the wrong approach
compared to the smartest guy in the race
Vivek
he just says good things about
Republicans and people in general and
and even Trump
does anybody hate Vivek because you
think he doesn't like you
he seems to like people
even seem to like the lgbtq
reporter who there was a famous viral
thing of them having a discussion he
seemed to like her
he seems to like people
that's a real good quality in the
president
but DeSantis uh did a little bit of the
deplorables mistake I would say he's
taken a little bit out of context if you
heard it in context it wouldn't hit you
the same
anacontext it does is more grading in
context he's making a point you could
argue about it but I think it was a
mistake
I would say it was a mistake to word it
that way certainly mocking people who
use truth social is just a big mistake
so
yeah it doesn't look like he's serious
about it
I don't know what it I feel like he
already knows that he's wasting his time
he acts like a person who's smart enough
to know none of this will help him
all right
uh
was it the Wall Street Journal I think
who's reporting that the war in Ukraine
could go on for years because
neither side has a clear goal that's
attainable
so they both have goals
but they're not attainable you know
Russia is not going to own all of
Ukraine Ukraine is not going to get its
land back so how do you ever have peace
and so the Wall Street Journal is saying
could be years of war
do you think we're that dumb
are we going to do this again
if we know we can end it a day and
honestly we can
now when I say we I think Vivek good
I think maybe de Santa is good I think
Trump could
I don't know how many of the others
could but you know maybe maybe Mike
Ben's good I don't know but it seems
pretty doable to me I'm pretty sure I
can do it myself
if I were president
it looks so doable that I don't believe
any of this and and you know you know
what's wrong with the framing
did you see what's wrong with the
framing I'll say the frame again you
tell me what's wrong with it
that neither Russian or Ukraine have
objectives that are both you know
clearly stated I want this but also
reasonably attainable
so they're saying that you know they're
they're conflicting
objectives are the problem
do you see what's wrong with that
framing
I want to see if it just jumps out to
anybody
what's wrong with that framing
it's pure propaganda
personal
oh my god it worked
oh my god it worked
they're they're diverting you from the
obvious and it worked
oh my God I'm having a moment here where
I'm actually horrified
I am horrified
you're going to be real mad when I tell
you
when they frame it as Ukraine and and
Russia want things but they're having
trouble getting them
here's the part you're missing
who the cares what either of them
want
who the cares
no if the United States wants them to
stop fighting we're going to make them
stop
that's it
I don't care if Ukraine wants it I don't
care what they want I don't care what
Putin wants
how did you all miss that was that did
they do such a good job of propaganda
that every one of you missed that
you're you they made you think that you
it matters what they think it doesn't
matter what they think they did the same
thing with Mexico
do you remember when uh you know
everybody said well the Mexican
government's never going to agree to our
military going in and operating against
the cartels the Mexican government's
never going to agree what's wrong with
that framing
who the cares what the Mexican
Government wants
it's not up to them they don't have a
 vote
we have the military the United States
and we're under attack
the Mexican Government zero vote
we're wasting our time and treasure in
Ukraine and it's costing us big time
does Ukraine have a voted now no no they
don't vote in the United States does
Putin have a vote nope nope not a vote
no if we get a president who can
actually see past narratives
that they can Trump can probably several
others can but I'll just mention too
you need somebody who can see past that
framing and we do have too I don't know
if we have more than actually
uh RFK Jr
we have three candidates who can three
see past the propaganda framing but I am
horrified that none of you did or at
least in the comments you didn't mention
it now now that I've mentioned it
do you see it
am I right
you see it right you see that the
framing of what they care about is just
absolutely
it should be a crime
the fact that they could even guide your
mind in that direction is just crazy
now this is a subset of a reframe in my
book
one of the reframes and reframe your
brain available now in Kindle is that
you don't know who has the power
and we often get lost in an assumption
of who has the power
Ukraine doesn't have any power
Russia doesn't have any power
and our government doesn't have any
power
you do
you and I do collectively we can decide
what our government does just by
answering polls that say don't do that
you know if it gets to 80 percent
the government can't do it there are
very few things your government can do
if 80 of the public is against it
because they need to get reelected and
stuff
so the American public has the power
but the media has cut you off from it by
this kind of narrative this kind of
narrative just takes all your power away
because you don't know you have the
power and you're like arguing about
stuff oh you creating this Putin that
they're not relevant
they are not relevant oh Europe not
relevant now the Great Britain was not
relevant
not relevant
military-industrial complex they want
well they're relevant unfortunately
shouldn't be
you can't be serious
yeah anyway the citizens do not have the
power because they believe they do not
so that doesn't seem to be changing so
at the moment they don't but it would
require only a reframe of how they think
before they went and all you would have
to do is tell the people you know if the
United States wants to end this we could
do it tomorrow what do you think do you
want to end it you don't think you would
get 80 saying well I didn't realize that
was an option no it is it's actually an
option you just ignore the interests of
the other people because you can and
they're not relevant to you
and then just end it
you just tell both sides you'll crush
them
you'll crush them
if they don't stop right now
I I think Trump's the only one who can
sell it
but Vivek can say it I mean maybe he
could sell it but Trump could sell it
all right
yeah what else is going on
that's about it
I don't think you need much more that's
a good solid hour of
content that you won't see anywhere else
and not too many commercials
all right uh
I saw that uh
the famous Twitter account captured
uh was complaining about the blocking
feature
and Elon Musk blocked him
and then Elon tweeted that he's blocking
people who are complaining about
blocking
he said let's see how you like it
and I thought you know yeah I love it I
love it
I I don't even though I don't love the
blocking
I just love the fact that he blocked
people from complaining about blocking
so they could see how they feel about
being blocked
he's helping he's helping
the second funny bad thing about that is
I blocked the cat turd a long time ago
because he's a idiot
I don't know maybe maybe you like it
maybe you follow him personally
he's an idiot that's that's my take
and I wouldn't want to see any of his
tweets again except that one was funny
uh James Wood
is making some news
uh
I saw a video from him that a video of
some you know youths attacking cars in
Philadelphia
and he tweeted the other day this isn't
fixable
does that sound familiar
this isn't fixable
now I don't think he follows me well he
probably caught the headlines don't you
think don't you think James would caught
the headlines about my cancellation
probably most people did
um
but it's not fixable where have you
heard that before besides me
who who is another person who said it's
not fixable
you have to know when to hold them and
know when to fold them right
Alice Jones Chris Rock really Chris Rock
I don't know about that
Alex Jones Bill Mitchell no Tim Poole
said it
yeah and by the way there's nothing
wrong with that
there's nothing wrong with that opinion
it's not it's not cruel it's just a
statement of what you think is happening
so I would like you know cities not to
fall into Decay I would like everybody
to have you know jobs and not walk on
on bums in the street
but it doesn't look like it's going to
happen and I would guess that the future
is building new cities
as as I said in the beginning and I
think the old ones just have to go
because
um I I think they need to bottom
and then probably they'll just turn it
into something else but I think cities
are probably on a long-term decline
and I don't think we should necessarily
try to fix them if they're not
interested in fixing themselves
so I would say get away from cities
if you can
I should do a podcast with Peter Zayn I
don't think he does guests does he I
think he just does his own thing he's
very interesting but
um I noted and I'm glad you mentioned
him so I mentioned the other day that
Peter Zan said that Russia's real goal
with you know all of its aggressive
moves were to make sure they controlled
the attack points to defend Russia
and if you look at them they they line
up very well with the most strategic
attack points now his take is if you
could you know make well I think I'm I'm
saying too much about his take I'll say
it's my take if that's true then I would
suggest there's a way to deal with
Russia where you say all right your
problem is these these choke points
maybe there's some way short of a war
that you can get some security and we
can get some security and we're not
nobody's giving up too much
so that would suggest if the Peter Zan
view of the world is right it's about
those choke points that gives you
something to negotiate
if the Wall Street Journal is Right
which is a totally different take and by
the way never mentioned the choke point
issue I've never seen it anywhere else
actually if it's true that the goals are
amorphous and impossible to get then you
can't have peace so the Wall Street
Journal article looks like an article
that was written by the military
industrial complex
I'm not saying it was but it reads like
it would you agree it shows no hope and
warns you that the war will take years
who benefits from that
military-industrial complex maybe the
neocons but as much as I think the Wall
Street Journal is you know one of the
best independent vehicles for news
and I'm not going to make an accusation
about that specific article
but use your own judgment
you know there there's another view that
would say it's negotiable
at least two for use and they acted like
because it's amorphous
that it can't be negotiated
the amorphous part is really not the
problem
and I don't know if they're just bad at
telling you all the context
or if they were influenced by the
military industrial complex right so
those are the questions you would ask
about a story like that
all right
um anybody else
got a topic I haven't talked about
uh you know one of the things about
being a public figure is there any way
to be a public figure and to not be
accused of being anti-semitic at some
point in your career
it's like literally unavoidable
all right
uh yeah China's in trouble
15-minute cities easy to pacify
shows everybody everything else
at this point as long as the government
can turn off your money which they can
do anytime they want
therefore control already
if the government can turn off your
money they already have full control
will the next hurricane be named Gavin
uh
e b c d e f g h no
it's gonna have to start with the letter
I right
because they go they go in order
it would have to be Lavin
yeah Alex Jones I don't know if his
I don't I can't imagine lockdowns
can't imagine lockdowns I can't imagine
another school
closing I just can't imagine it
um
all right
Dei
all right I think we've talked about it
all and uh ladies and gentlemen I'm
gonna go talk to the locals people
thanks for joining YouTube
uh
Scott believes these people have reasons
I don't know which people but if you
believe that I think that people operate
on reason
you have not you have not followed me
for very long
bye for now
