so
just in case you can't get enough of me
today there's
new breaking news that i think i can put
some context on
that will help you out so i'm just going
to do a quick little
topic on the coroner's report the
autopsy report
on george floyd
first of all the the president will
alert on my phone so
we've got a curfew here tonight
so the president is going to send in the
military if necessary
and they're going to dominate the
streets as they say so tonight
it could be interesting but here's
here's what we found out today the
the autopsy says that george floyd
was intoxicated with fentanyl
fentanyl fentanyl
now when i saw the video of
the tragic death of george floyd i'm
going to tell you something i haven't
said in public
i thought it was a fentanyl overdose
that was actually the first thing i
thought when i saw it
and the reason i thought that is that
his lights just sort of went out
and there's there's a very important
thing you need to know about the
fentanyl
and this will explain pretty much
everything well two things you need to
know
one is that you saw the um you saw the
police
seem to be fighting with him in the
backseat of the car
and he was acting irrationally people on
fentanyl can act
pretty irrationally so he wasn't really
in
his right mind so he probably had to be
physically restrained
because there probably wasn't any amount
of talking to him that would have helped
if you've ever dealt with somebody who's
who's really
you know stoned on on fentanyl you can't
really reason with them
that's not a thing you have to actually
physically control them
physically every every part of it you
have to physically control them
unfortunately i've been in this
situation so there's nothing like
talking to them that can work
nothing it's just like there's a wild
animal
and you're trying to control it like a
lion or something
there's there's no human conversation
that will do anything for you under
those conditions
now even though he was talking and
saying things that made sense
that doesn't mean that he would have
listened to things that made sense it's
very different
um here's the other thing you need to
know and this is something i learned
when i
found out about fentanyl deaths that if
you're an experienced
fentanyl user you know how to sit in the
chair
in case you pass out because if you pass
out
and your head falls forward like this
you will die because the fentanyl knocks
you out
and falling forward if you do it wrong
will close off your breathing
and unlike a person who is drunk or on
other drugs
you won't wake up so you'll cut off your
own breathing by being in the wrong
position
and you'll just die because you won't
wake up on fentanyl
so i understand that the experienced
users will find a place that they're
leading back
so if they pass out their their airways
will be open
and if you were if you were in the right
position your odds of dying from
fentanyl actually go way down now
on top of the fentanyl there were three
cops
on him and one was on his neck now the
thing that never quite made sense
is that it just didn't seem like the cop
was aware that he was killing him that
never really made sense did it
and that would make sense if the cops
knew he was intoxicated on
something bad they obviously knew that
but
he wouldn't have known that that
pressure
here i'm speculating a little bit he
wouldn't have known
what kind of pressure would kill
somebody if they were on fentanyl
so if for example he passed
down from the fentanyl and the cop kept
his
knee on him that could have easily
killed him because there wouldn't have
been any
instinct or just natural reflex
to to try to get air so
when um george floyd was
fighting for air and complaining he was
probably fine
but the moment he passed out which
probably was the fentanyl
then he could no longer control whether
his his neck was open or closed
and that might have been it now this is
just speculation it's not medical i'm
not a medical doctor
the only thing i'm adding to the
conversation
uh the only thing about into the
conversation is that the position of the
neck
plus fentanyl is deadly
if you didn't know that the fentanyl
kills you
largely because the position of your
neck
then you then that would be confusing
so when i watched it um
when i watched it it did it did look
like eod
and that was actually my first thought
but i didn't want to say that
out of respect obviously but now that we
have a confirmation that was in the
system
along with some meth apparently
somebody says if you can talk you can
breathe that's correct
so so when he was talking he he had not
yet lost
control of his breathing
so what does this mean now one thing it
means is that there will be people who
say the fentanyl will kill them and
therefore not the cops
we'll never know that because the the
most likely scenario
is that it was a combination but
here's the problem here's the problem
if there was much fentanyl in the system
and i don't know how much
but enough if there was enough
um he's going to get off so the cop is
going to be
he's going to get off because all the
defense has to do is say
how do you know it wasn't the fentanyl
by itself
right that's the end of the story um
chinese fentanyl
killed 50 000 people this year in the
united states alone
and every one of them died exactly the
way
george floyd did with or without a knee
they died the exact same way with or
without
anybody's knee on them so the defense is
just going to say there was fentanyl in
them and that was it that's it that's
the end of the case
so um that doesn't mean that he
is innocent i'm not saying that i'm
saying that from a legal perspective
in terms of guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt
not a chance yeah if he really had any
you know i suppose if the fentanyl in
him was some trace amount
it's gonna matter how much there was but
if it was some trace amount
maybe they can they can say it didn't
matter
but if there's a good amount like you
just had some
that's that's it anyway i just wanted to
give you that little update
so we should follow the news about nex
somebody says meth as well um would have
the same problem
but but follow the news about neck
position and
fentanyl and you're going to learn
something that's all for now
