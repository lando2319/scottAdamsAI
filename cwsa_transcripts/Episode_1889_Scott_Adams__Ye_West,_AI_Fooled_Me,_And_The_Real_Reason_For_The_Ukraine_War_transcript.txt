foreign
good morning everybody
welcome to the highlight of civilization
it's the the light and the goodness and
the well it's the awesomeness that you
hoped you'd find
and you did it oh you did it good job
good job everybody yeah let's take it up
to another level because I know you can
oh you're not done we can take the
amazingness up to levels heretofore
unknown and all you need is a copper mug
or a glass detector Chelsea sign the
canteen Joker flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day thing makes everything better
it's called this simultaneous Sip and
you don't want to miss this you don't
want to do not miss this go
savor it savor it
favorite
good
now we can talk about all the things and
all the things
does it ever does it matter what I talk
about
I think some of you are so acclimated to
The Habit and I'm not sure it matters
what I talk about
I think everybody just likes being here
you know to enjoy this uh simultaneity
but we do have interesting stories today
as it turns out
uh how many of you saw
Kanye or yay or Mr West or the artist
formerly known as Katie
how many of you saw him on Tucker
first of all how much balls does it take
to wear it for Kanye to wear a white
lives
matter shirt and then go on Tucker as
your first big interview
I had the balls on that guy
you know it's just amazing I'll tell you
what bothers me when other people talk
about yay
it bothers me when he's spoken of as an
artist
because it's not so much that he creates
art
it's a he is art
there's a whole there's a difference
I create art
like I'll you know if you could call it
that a comic strip
but it feels like everything he does
like he just lives and breathes
a different reality and then we get to
see it sometimes
so it really doesn't feel like he
creates
merchandise that is Art it just feels
like he's a walking art
I don't know there's something different
going on with with him and I've decided
that uh that yea is my spiritual guide
I'm not a I'm not a Believer so I'm not
uh you know I'm not all the way into the
God thing
but
I think uh yay and by the way I love his
first name
don't you like going into something and
already already celebrating success
I just met you yay
it's like
it's like yeah yeah
yay is the most inspiring possible name
you could ever have yay it's just like
good news yay
um anyway the only the only downside is
not everybody knows who you're talking
about yet so I gotta work on that
but uh
so this is what uh yay said when asked
why he wore a white
lives matter shirt he said because it's
the obvious thing
because it's true
and that's a problem apparently it's a
problem to say something that's obvious
and true
and everybody agrees with
well does everybody agree with it
I saw a tweet today from Isaac Hayes III
I assume he's
related to the famous Isaac Hayes the
actor I'm guessing just because of the
third part
but anyways he's a he's got a little
blue check there
and here's what he said in a tweet he
said Kanye West wore that white lives
matter t-shirt and the safety security
and distance of Paris France I bet you
you won't wear that shirt in Atlanta
Detroit Baltimore Philly Memphis Houston
Compton or Queens
I dare him to go stand in any Hood in
America with that shirt on
um
I'm not sure that Isaac Hayes III is
making the point that he hoped to make
I feel like he's making Kanye's point or
yay's point
does it sound like he they agreed
do you think that yay would have worn
that shirt
if it had been safe to wear anywhere
that's sort of the point I mean that's
exactly the point
is that it wouldn't even be safe to wear
there
um so I and just as a point of unity I
would agree with Isaac Hayes III that
not only should Kanye not wear that
shirt in those neighborhoods but nobody
should go to those neighborhoods
it doesn't matter what shirt you're
wearing why the would you go to any
of those neighborhoods
can we is it it's 22 22 could we say
something honest
that will get me banned from all social
media
why would anybody go to a mostly black
community in the United States in 2022.
why would anybody if you had it if you
had a choice whether you're black
whether you're white whether you're
anything in between why would anyone go
into the highest crime neighborhoods
with the highest with the highest
likelihood of violent outcome and
nothing good happening why would anybody
go there
so yeah Isaac Hayes III Kanye should not
wear that shirt in those areas Kanye
shouldn't go anywhere near those areas
neither should you
stay out of those areas it doesn't
matter if you're a white or black or
you're wearing clothes or no clothes
you want to stay away from those areas
all right
just before I got on I saw some tweets
apparently the CIA is now saying
at least to the news
that they thought that uh
Ukraine would be overtaken uh very
easily in a matter of days
is there anything that the CIA has
gotten more right
than me guessing
and I mean that seriously that's an
absolute
serious statement
have they done better or worse
than me just looking at the news and
just guessing
no no I've actually smoked them it's not
even close
don't you think they should be
recruiting me
I mean you could replace the entire CIA
with me guessing
at least you know the analytical part
you might still need some operatives
but just ask me what would you like to
know
I'm not saying I'll be right every time
you know Lord knows I won't be right but
I'm not going to be telling you there's
a secret Sonic weapon in the embassy
no no I'm not going to tell you that
right
I'm not going to tell you the wmd that
doing wmds in Iraq
I didn't see any
who knows anyway
um there is a Twitter account that the
profile pretends
that it's some kind of uh assisted AI
or some kind of an AI
and it's pretending like it's tweeting
not as a human
but I think it's a trick
so the account is Gaia
uh V 0.42
the the actual Twitter feed in case you
want to look it for yourself because I
actually don't know
I think I think it's not AI
it looks like a person pretending to be
AI but I can't really tell
so take a look at it so it's at 42
underscore Gaia g-a-i-a
and it purports to have read my book
God's debris
from 2001
it purports to have read that book and
did a book review
and it clearly understands the book
it actually understands the book not
only does it understand if it
understands it's it's uh positioned in
in Civilization
which is hard to understand
and I looked at it I thought I can't
tell I really couldn't tell if that was
a human or or an AI
now
is this the first time
does today does today Mark a turning
point
because I genuinely can't tell
so if it's AI
if it is AI it passed the Turing test
I mean the the Twitter version of a
touring test
I don't know
today did anybody have a moment to go
look at it it looks not real right
or at least partially not real
yeah I think it's not real
all right we'll find out
but uh the fact that I can't tell
is uh pretty pretty revealing now
um
here's a question
have you ever looked at the whole
Ukraine war situation and said to
yourself
it feels like there's some gigantic
unexplained variable
does anybody have that feeling
just something about how hard we're
pushing to save Ukraine that doesn't
exactly make sense maybe some of you
thought it has something to do with
Hunter Biden you know maybe we're being
blackmailed by zielinski or something
and so I thought to myself
well if if it were something else
what would explain everything
if it were something else and just out
of the blue I said to myself
is there any chance
the Ukraine is sitting on a ton of
lithium
so I Googled it
Ukraine
is believed to be sitting on
a ton of lithium
are there any other questions
there are no other questions are there
right now now we know the whole thing
the amount of lithium there is in the
trillions trillions
trillions
Biden might be pulling off
the elimination of Russia as a
superpower
and making
uh battery is actually economical and
feasible because right now there's a
lithium shortage and you know we don't
want to depend on China Etc
so if we could get a friendly-ish
nato-ish country that had a ton of
lithium
that changes everything
doesn't it
changes everything and you can imagine
the Ukraine that would have perhaps
lower environmental concerns
so you could actually get it out of the
ground
yeah uh it's it's rare earth minerals in
general and now the second part that I
did not
um and I think I saw a hint in the
comments I don't know if that lithium is
in the part that zelensky controls
or is the lithium by coincidence
in the disputed parts
because don't don't without doing any
research
no you kind of assume that it's in the
disputed Parts
you know I if I had to guess without
doing any Geo engineering whatsoever
there's probably more of it in Crimea
and Don bass than anywhere else just
because that's the way the world works
because everything works that way
yeah that's what it looks like
imagine if if Russia controlled not only
all that gas and oil but also the
lithium
that'd be a pretty big problem
if they had the lithium and the the gas
and the oil
and now it looks like they won't have
any of it or at least you know they'll
be less important as a provider
now does that blow your mind
let me ask you this
why am I the first person to tell you
that now it wasn't hard to Google
I mean it came right up on Google other
people have Googled it you can tell
because Google has already organized the
answer
enough people have Googled it
so Google put it as part of one of its
standard question and answer things for
things that people ask all the time
think about that think about the fact
that so many people have Googled it
that Google has organized it as a quick
answer
and you've never heard it on the news
have you
has any one of you heard
the Ukraine might have enormous
supplies of the thing we need more than
just about anything
no not once
oh one of you says yes
oh some of you are saying yes
I wonder where you heard it
for those of you some of you okay I see
some of you said or say yes
oh you're somebody who's confirming you
gotta write on the nose Don best region
the Ukraine yep there you go
it's the Don bass and their and
their minerals
there it is
on Twitter months ago did anybody see it
in any um
Fox News somebody says
somebody on Fox news said that
who was it
was it a just a guess because I've never
heard any of the hosts say it but I you
know don't watch every minute
huh
so
all right well
if you want to stay cynical and I know
you do
I think that's going to be a big one of
the big variables
if any of you noticed a bunch of fake
news local news sites
so axios as apparently discovered
that there's a a bunch of fake local
news sites run by democrats
so Democrats are putting together
websites that appear to be some kind of
alternative local news
so that you would see the the Democrats
spin on the news without knowing that
it's fake
have you seen them because I feel like I
have
I I've seen local news looking pages
that to me looked like they were sort of
suddenly sprung up
it turns out there are six writers
writing all the articles
except for the ones that are just sort
of clipped from other places
thank you John
um
anyway
so that's happening
and it's interesting that we don't call
that election interference
isn't that interesting
because it is it's election interference
but why is there no law against creating
fake websites
I I get why we don't have laws against
saying something incorrect in the news
or even lying in the news because it'd
be too hard to police that but I feel
like I feel like creating a fake news
site
is interfering with an election
and that's different than just lying
about a news story
now I don't think it's illegal probably
not yeah First Amendment whatever but
the First Amendment doesn't cover
fraud
right first amendment we're covering you
being accidentally incorrect
and lots of other stuff but it doesn't
cover fraud
fraud is still illegal I just don't
think that specific crime is necessarily
on the books but it should be this
should be illegal
I have some uh suggestion for you I
republished my hoax list every now and
then it's the top 15 or so items which
are known political domestic hoaxes run
by the Democrats and their machine
now I'm not adding uh the Russia
pipeline
bombing hoax
in my opinion it's obvious that the
United States or its proxies took out
the the pipeline
but so while I I'm sure that's a hoax
I'm not including it because I allow
lying for military purposes
so that's a different point
that the hoaxes on the hoax list were
purely domestic political stuff
and and it's entirely about you know
winning elections so those are the
hoaxes that are on the hoax list but
if you're military
lies to your enemies and lies to your
allies and lies to you for military
advantage
I'm okay with that
that's what we pay them for if they
didn't do that I'd be a little more
worried if there's a big Advantage so if
they wanted to blow that up for the
Strategic advantage and they knew that
lying about it would be the best cover
for it
I'm fine with that I'm absolutely fine
with that and now what about the fact
that they're lying to us domestically
well here's the thing
I didn't mind that lie when I knew it
was an obvious lie because it's like
it's like a lie with a wink isn't it
when you hear the American officials say
no we had we had nothing to do with it
oink
does that feel like a lie
it doesn't feel like a lie to me when
they wink
all right because Trump's done that too
Trump's winked at you you know it right
so domestically it didn't bother me
because I'm like oh it's one of those
obvious lies that you tell during a war
just to give yourself some cover okay
it's a war
foreign
but then I saw how many people on the
news apparently believe it
have you seen the I think Tucker had a
compilation clip of people in the left
leaning news who are quite adamant that
it's ridiculous to blame the United
States for that just absurd
and I watched them I think
are you looking at the same reality I'm
looking at because in my reality it's
it's not only have they completely
admitted it in every way you could
possibly admit it without saying it
without saying it directly they've
admitted as clearly as they could but to
imagine that you would defend them after
they've admitted it
indirectly but certainly admitted it
so you say they're not admitting
somebody says okay
technically they're not admitting it
I'll give you that they are technically
not admitting it but in all practical
ways yeah they're signaling to you we
definitely did this
so that's not on the list but uh
certainly I rack that as untrue
here's what you should do if you show
that hoax list to somebody and they say
as they often do
several of the things on that list
actually are true
I saw them with my own eyes I know
they're true
what should you say should you engage
and debunk each of them because it's
pretty easy to do
or
here's my new technique
I respond with I'm sorry they did that
to you
so if somebody says they believe five
things on the hoax list
I'm sorry they did that to you
yeah I'm really sorry about that
and that's it
and then just walk away
you should show compassion and empathy
for someone who's been this this fooled
don't if you try to uh if you try to dig
in you just trigger them into cognitive
dissonance and then nothing good happens
but if you just show your empathy I'm
really sorry this happened to you
ah because here's the thing anybody who
reads that list and says there are five
of them that look true
if they say there are five of them that
look true to them they've already
accepted that there are 10 things on the
list from the same people the same
sources
that they know were lies
so they've already accepted that they
think five of the fifteen are true well
knowing the Ten of them are not from the
same sources
from the same sources so when the people
are arguing that the five are true
I'm not sure they completely believe
themselves because there's got to be a
little doubt
when you see the ten that clearly are
not true
so I think just sympathy is the way to
go no I I've had nobody come back at me
after taking that approach
because they just sort of slink away to
lick their wounds or think about it or
something I don't know
um
so the news is saying that the FBI may
be bringing gun and tax charges against
Hunter Biden so I guess the gun charges
are about lying on an application
and the tax charges presumably are about
making some money with his overseas
deals and not not properly recording
them
now
what is missing
seems like there's something missing
What's missing
dog not barking
well what's missing is the primary
concern
well drugs is missing but I don't know I
don't know that he was actually
caught with drugs and I don't care about
the drugs I I don't think he should be
prosecuted for drugs
I just I think that's small ball
um
so it seems to me that the thing we
cared about the most is that the bidens
were selling out the United States to
rut to uh
to China
and it looked like they were going to
try to make money promoting the belt and
Road initiative
which would basically be working for
China more than the United States
because that's their big strategic
long-term strategic play is to have you
know Commerce control of the whole world
so if the bidens were helping them do
that this is the allegation that's
really bad
that's like serious traitor situation
but
that's not on the list of things that
they're going to deal with and I wonder
if the play here is to make us think
that all of Hunter's problems have been
dealt with
before the election
that looks like the play doesn't it
because you know the the Democrats never
asked detailed questions on politics
it probably works both ways you know as
soon as you hear something that you want
to hear you stop asking questions that's
true for all of us it's true for me I
know I know that when I when I'm
researching something and I get to the
opinion that totally agrees with me
I'm usually done researching
I'm not proud of that but that is the
way it works you know you you search
until you find something that agrees
with you and then you're done
researching
um
anyway it looks to me like what's
happening is the Democrats are trying to
minimize the hunter Biden Pain by
looking at the gun and tax charges which
all of us think are
sort of blue-collary and not our problem
right the gun charge is really filled
out a box wrong it's illegal whatever
the lie was on it it's a federal crime
it's a big penalty but is also the sort
of thing you could imagine if it
happened to you
you wouldn't really think that the
penalty should be that big right
you wouldn't really feel like that was
the worst crime in the world now if he'd
been a drug dealer or a murderer and he
lied to get a gun oh throw the book at
him that would just be extra stuff to
throw at him but given that he honestly
got a gun for it looks like self-defense
it looks like he was just pursuing his
second amendment rights honestly
and if there was a if there was a piece
of paperwork that prevented him from
having his second amendment rights
uh I'm not the guy who's going to say
that's the worst crime in the world are
you
it's a crime
but does that feel like the worst crime
in the world
you're if you're a second amendment
proponent
and someone who did not have any illegal
intentions to use the gun illegally
simply got a gun like everybody else
could get a gun
it's a crime but it's so close to being
nothing
in my opinion and I think enough people
would be close to that opinion now you
have to be pretty political to think
that's the biggest crime in the world
and again if he'd been a criminal and
had criminal intentions
than lying to get a gun is a pretty big
deal
but if you just wanted to have the same
rights as your other Americans to defend
yourself with a firearm and you had to
lie in a box for the government to do it
I'm okay just lie in the box I
don't care
don't care at all
so what it looks like and I think uh
harmeet was saying this that it looks
like a diversionary play so they're
going to make us look at the small stuff
which could get explained away or he
could just pay for the taxes I mean one
of the possibilities is that they say
Hey you owe a bunch of taxes and then he
just pays it
and then they say you know this gun
thing is bad but you don't have other
major crimes so we're just going to give
you some suspended whatever
so I think you'll pay the taxes
you'll get whatever is the lightest
crime you can get for checking the wrong
box on a forum
and then they will divert us entirely
from the bigger question of working with
China
or Ukraine and and then the the
Democrats will be able to say
they will be able to say
everything about Hunter has been checked
out
that that's done that's a done business
he paid his taxes
the courts the courts uh took care of
all the hunter Biden stuff
and then all the Democrats will say all
right
that Hunter stuff worried me but I'm
glad it's all behind us now and none of
it will be behind it it's just that
they'll be able to say it because they
diverted you into these lesser looking
crimes
it's a good play and then of course
there's the the pardon aspect you know
maybe they need to convict him get all
the charges out there so that Dad Biden
can pardon him which would be fine with
me by the way
that's not going to be a popular opinion
but if Dad Biden pardoned him for the
gun charges and I don't know if the
taxes will be anything except a fine
but if if his father kept him out of
jail
for that I'll be okay with it
it wouldn't be Justice it wouldn't be
justice but it would be a practical
thing that I would have applied to Trump
as well
I I would have also said in the same
situation shoe on the other foot
right I use the dershowitz standard
that if I would have treated it
differently if it happened to Trump
I can't do that I gotta treat the same
and I would have traded it differently I
would have said now we should not be
sending the family of our presidents to
jail wall that President's in office
for stuff like that I mean had it been
murdered that's different you know rape
that's different
but for this stuff
I just don't think you want a president
having his family member in jail it's
just too much of a distraction so I'm
too selfish
I'm selfish I want my president to be
focusing on the country
and if it's a distraction there's some
family member I would rather have some
injustice
a little bit of Injustice
just so I can get the bigger benefit of
a president who's focusing on the work
so just me so had this been Trump I'd be
perfectly happy with the pardon same way
so if by the way if Trump gets reelected
and he's ever in this situation
remember I said this
please
because I know you're gonna somebody's
gonna say oh would you have said this if
it were if it were about Hunter Biden
and I and I need you to know I just said
that about Hunter button yes yes same
treatment
foreign
you want to know some good news
how would you like some good news
like just off the hook
good news
like news is so good
you almost can't believe it
so maybe we shouldn't
uh here are the big tech knowledges for
the future
and these are coming on board like
really quickly all right uh AI of course
uh there's now uh BYU university
um now has developed a nuclear
a nuclear power source
that fits on a
basically you put it on a big truck a
40-foot truck bed
and it doesn't have any risk of melting
down
and it doesn't have a nuclear waste
problem
and they can already make it
just think about that so it's a I guess
it's a molten salt design so it's one of
the new generations that we've been
waiting for and what's different about
it is if the nuclear reaction gets out
of control
Well it can't be so it can't get out of
control because it will immediately go
into molten salt and something happens
blah blah blah but basically they made a
reactor that can be mass produced
shipped anywhere on a truck
it will power a thousand homes
and there doesn't seem to be a downside
it seems to be economical doable now of
course you always have the massive
um
approval problems right
I think Trump could solve those I don't
know that Biden can but Trump can get
rid of regulations it's one thing that
nobody questions whether he can do it
yes yes Trump can get rid of regulations
we know he'll do that
that's climate change right there
all of our energy problems are
salt
for the future
they're actually solved
now this assumes that this is a real
story
and it looks real I mean you could
research it yourself I tweeted it
but uh that's that would be amazing and
it would be the thing that many of us
have waited for so for the last five
years or so I and lots of others have
talked about this so-called generation
four nuclear plants that would be able
to do stuff like this
it looks like we have it
and they're not the only the BYU is not
the only entity trying to create this I
think Rolls-Royce was trying to do it
there might be some other entities so
this is happening
you we definitely are going to have
nuclear power on trucks
we're there
best news in human civilization
because as smart people have often said
you can track civilizations progress
it perfectly matches our energy
availability
did you know that
if you look at you know availability to
energy and energy prices and all that
you know civilization just tracks energy
I don't believe there's a country
energy that did poorly
has there ever been a country
that like a energy and then didn't do
well
I don't think so
all right some more Technologies of
course we'll have robots will be our
friends and doing our work there have
been another advance in Quantum
computing
so China's allegedly a little behind the
United States in Quantum Computing but
the quantum computers will be able to do
things that would take a thousand years
with their best computers today
and so if you have quantum computers you
can solve all kinds of problems from
Supply chains to God knows what
power problems Etc
so if you add
artificial intelligence molten assault
nuclear reactors on trucks
Quantum Computing robots
and then better Battery Technology
so there's some companies trying to make
batteries that seem to be just as good
or better than our usual lithium ones
but without the lithium
maybe that's the big deal or maybe we
get our lithium from Ukraine and
we go you know it's we go big every way
you can do a battery
but
um things are looking really really good
technology wise
the only thing I'm less worrying about
is the value of money
you know inflation and and that sort of
thing and I'm going to tell you
something that will scare you but maybe
explain to you
why we should be okay
it goes like this
your economy and the value of anything
is psychological
right if I had a Lamborghini you know
that cost me I don't know whatever they
cost a million dollars and nobody wanted
to buy it from me
its value would be zero you know
assuming I didn't want it either
right so all value is psychological we
don't think that way
we we think you know this car has a
value this business has a value this
employee has a value but they don't
value is only in your head
it's only in your head
it's represented by these things but the
values in your head so the economy
entirely rests on our mental state
if if I pull a little green piece of
paper out of my wallet and say I'll give
you this for that thing you have in your
hand and you say yes
then we've done everything that we need
for an economy you agreed my paper is
worth something I agreed your thing is
worth something and we trade it
now
people who are worried about
um
just money being worthless or you know
everything just melting down
here's why it won't
nobody wants it to
that's why I won't everybody wants money
to work
so we're all going to just keep
pretending it works and
there could be like uh you know there
could be some minor like runs on things
maybe we lose a bank you know maybe a
big Bank goes down but we're basically
in pretty good shape because the
psychology of the world is actually
pretty strong
we all want money to work
so that's probably all it takes we'll
just agree that money works and when I
give it to you you'll agree to take it
and then we're done
now that's the most simplistic
explanation of Economics you've ever
heard in your life
but it is
true
that's true
I've showed you how uh Trump can create
money out of nothing right
all he does is tell you everything's
fine
and then the stock market goes up in
value
it's literally just he creates money
with his with his mind
so
um I think we're in good shape it just
doesn't look like it and we could be on
the
on the border of
the Golden Age
we could be
um so Biden is going to
give pardons to all the people who are
convicted in federal weed cases
so if you're if you have a federal
conviction for weed he is going to
Pardon you
so that's all good news right
big deal
free money on the table
oh let's read into the details
there are zero federal prisoners with
only marijuana charges
zero
there aren't any
they're none
there are people who also have marijuana
charges but that's not why they're in
jail
if they only had marijuana charges they
probably would already be out of jail
now the states of course have their own
laws there's that right
but it looks like
maybe nobody will be affected
now the federal problem with marijuana
was more about the selling of it
wasn't it because I don't know anybody
who's ever been arrested for federal
marijuana charges do you
I never even heard of it I've never
heard of one person who's ever been
arrested for federal
I mean you'd have to be a pretty big
operation don't you
so
um I think that Biden picked up the free
money on the table because probably
Trump should have done this
everybody told Trump to do this
everybody said Trump this is free money
this definitely will work for you
electorally just do it and he didn't we
don't know why
but remember everybody always says how
come you never blame Trump for anything
this is clearly a success for Biden and
a failure for Trump clearly
does anybody disagree with that no even
though the actual impact is minimal to
none
it was still free money just sitting on
the table Biden just picked it up
there's nothing I say more often about
Trump
than the fact that he picks up free
money when it's on the table and he just
walked past this table over and over
again he just kept walking past this
table there's no way I'm going to say
that was smart
there's no way I'm going to say there
was some clever 3D like you know reason
he did it no just a mistake just a pure
mistake Biden gets the win
and and there's no even though I'm
saying it won't have much impact it was
still clearly the right thing to do
clearly
so I'm going to give him the clean win
even though it's not much in the real
world
all right
um
so apparently the one member of The
Proud boys who is described as a top
lieutenant
um it has pleaded guilty to seditious
conspiracy and I guess he's going to
cooperate
and they have him dead to rights for his
seditious conspiracy because among other
things they have a recording of him at
the time he didn't actually attend so
here's somebody who did not attend
January 6. because he had been stabbed
in a some prior event so he was
recovering from a stab wound he wasn't
even there but he was part of the
organizing and talking about it before
so one of the things that they have as
evidence to uh
to put the pressure on him to plead
guilty for seditious conspiracy is that
he said the following thing which is
known
they have this on recording all right so
the the next thing I tell you is not
guessing
they have it on recording in the actual
time it was happening and here's what he
said
uh
oh he posted publicly to the right so he
posted it publicly on some kind of
telegram
was it telegram Maybe
um but he posted publicly to writers uh
and he wrote in all in all big letters
do not go home we are on the cusp of
saving the Constitution
we are on the cusp of saving the
Constitution
that's why he said during January 6. now
which part of that is seditious
conspiracy
in his own words
at the time
in his own words he said it wasn't a
seditious conspiracy he was trying to
prevent one
that's what his words say
his words say that they're there to save
the Constitution
saving the Constitution means you think
somebody else was doing something and
you're there to stop it
none of this says seditious conspiracy
it says literally the opposite of that
it looks like he was trying to stop his
seditious conspiracy in his opinion
now whether or not that was a clear view
of reality is different
but they actually pressure this guy to
plead guilty
for to something for which their own
evidence clears him
this guy must have a really bad lawyer I
I feel like I could have lawyer this guy
out of jail I would just say yeah yeah
he did organize all the things that
happened he totally did that
but he didn't say do anything violent I
think I don't know if that's true I
think that's true he didn't say anything
violent and his explanation was he was
trying to save the Constitution
so he may have done things you don't
like and maybe it needs to be punished
for it but none of it had to do with
overthrowing the country
it was the opposite he believed somebody
had tried to overthrow the country he
was trying to stop it
it wasn't organized yeah that that begs
the question of organized
if there were a bunch of people talking
about it
it's organized ish
yeah but maybe not a leader per se
but that story amazes me
and that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the end of my prepared
comments
um
is there anything I missed
yeah most of the January 6 people can't
afford their legal defense that's true
um
pointing out these things doesn't make
us feel better
um
all right
um
I I do think we have time for another
sip
you know the the Snowden uh not
something
um but the uh
what's his name
um
Assange
um the Assad's situation I don't feel
comfortable
uh that I understand it fully
because the alleged worst things that he
did seemed to be in the secret domain
right
am I right
that nobody can tell us directly what
bad things happened because of Assange
we are only told the super secret bad
things happened
am I right about that or or do we know
something specific happened
that was bad bad bad
we
we do
yeah
so I don't know exactly now
would Trump be a lame duck if elected
yes but he would be the most fun lame
deck of all time Trump as a lame duck
would not be acting like a lame duck
Trump as a lame duck would be acting
like the controls were off he could do
anything you wanted
I mean if he had Congress on his side
um
during the Obama University I used a
messing job in China and got about 17
officers killed
all right yeah so I don't know about the
Assange claims but the fact that I don't
know what the claims are would be enough
for me to support
him not being treated the way he's being
treated
uh it's still a lame duck if he has
Congress
just by definition because he can't run
again
is Joe Biden persuasive
uh well
I think he's persuasive and a generic
politician way meaning that his own side
is willing to believe him
Ann Coulter was on Michael malice was
that a good show
sounds like it would be
all right
uh the Obama Minister swample not
Assange for pointing it out
yeah the the Tony bobolinski interview
um I've already heard enough from Tony
bobolinski to know
that whatever was happening over there
was exactly what you thought it was
that whole Hunter Biden influence
peddling thing apparently was exactly
what you thought it was exactly what you
thought it was
so but our outrage has been exhausted
now
yeah it's hard it's hard to think that's
the important thing to work on today
uh do the hunter story of the election
was effectively rigged well a lot of
people say that
because the hunter Biden story was uh
suppressed
we do have a system in which the real
voting is the media
all right so here's a reframe for you
we do the technical voting and the
voting booths and you know with the
ballots and stuff so that's the the
technical voting but the real voting
happens in the media
because the media tells you who to vote
for
if they didn't tell you to vote for
who knows what would happen
so I would argue that
the hunter Biden laptop thing
was the election
so the the misinformation and it's both
sides right both sides lie during an
election so The Lying by both sides is
what in the end in the end the Electoral
result was a result of who lied the best
in the media
would would you say that that's true
that the the outcome of the result the
election
was mostly about who lied the most
effectively in in the media
it wasn't mostly about counting the
votes because that's just the result of
all the lying in the media the lying in
the media is what gets you the result
the counting is just what makes it
official and then the Electoral College
just you know puts a little shine on it
yeah so it's interesting that the real
vote is in the media
as I've just described and yet you can
cheat in the media completely
there doesn't seem to I don't even think
there's a law against is there is there
any law against a major news entity just
making up a story because we've seen him
do it I mean they would say we didn't
make it up we're reporting what somebody
told us but still
so it is totally legal to uh cheat and
lie in our elections the way our system
is run
is completely legal
because the real voting happens in the
media and then just the pulling of the
the levers and stuff you've already
decided by that point
yeah
all right
um
if you get caught lying as a journalist
yeah
we are indirectly paying them to lie to
us well that's true
we pay our politicians and our media
people to lie to us that's literally
what we're doing
maybe all the wars are started by the
media
maybe all of them
what happens if Russia collapses
well here's my prediction
uh that Russia will be degraded
but that Putin will stay in power
that's what I think I think you'll stay
in power with a degraded Russia
but I don't think people will be as
worried about their military anymore do
you know what the smartest thing Russia
could do
is stop being the way they are
because look at the advantages that
Russia has
they have this like massive amount of uh
energy
they have an educated population
and lots of land
right tons of land
um Russia kind of had everything they
had everything
everything they needed and and were
natural allies with Russia right all
Russia had to do was stop acting like
Russia and they could have they could
have anything they wanted
it was all theirs for the taken
um
you know at this point the only thing uh
Russia needs to worry about is China I
think
he wants to recreate the Soviet Union
well
yeah I suppose he he does
that's what he says right
I don't want to be a mind reader but the
way he talks certainly suggests that
all right
the Russian people were getting shelled
for eight years in the donbass
y um have I ever said anything that
would suggest
that I believe that the ukrainians are
good guys
if I ever say anything that would make
you think that that in my opinion this
is clearly a case of Russians are bad
and ukrainians are all good
I've never said that in fact I don't
even think there's a difference
if you tell me there's a difference
between a Ukrainian and a Russian I'd
say well sure whatever
I'm sure it's a big difference to them
yeah it might be a big difference to
that but not to pay to me it just looks
like a civil war
uh
Russia light
you call Ukraine Russia light
all right
um tomorrow just to give you a little
heads up
by tomorrow I think tonight I'll get my
black lives matter shirt
so I'm going to wear my black lives
matter shirt on uh live stream
but I'm also going to put uh in I'm
going to update my profile
so I think I'm going to put a Ukrainian
flag
possibly a little blue wave
uh I don't know about the Blue Wave I
don't like that one so I might do a
Ukrainian flag
might do some pronouns
and I'm definitely going to put BLM
so I'm going to put black lives matter
pronouns and Ukraine flag
and then I'm going to make sure that
there are plenty of public pictures of
me wearing the black lives matter shirt
and here's the important part
I'm completely sincere
nobody's going to believe it nobody's
going to believe it but you know
if I could have done this in an
insincere way
I probably would have
because it would be really funny but as
it turns out Kanye sort of ruined the
insincere part
in a good way
because you know once once Kanye makes
it legal and okay to say White lives
matter
well then I can put on a black lives
matter shirt with no
um no qualifications
I don't have to add any qualifications
and if somebody says why are you doing
that they'll say
because it's true
okay and it's obvious
black lives matter
so I don't have to lie and I don't even
have to be a weasel
I don't have to I don't have to do
anything
I can actually just be an honest
American and I can just put on the shirt
that says yes I respect
the black Americans in this well black
lives not just Americans
um and that I honestly feel that way
because I do
I would hope that you do too
so
I wonder how much trouble I'll get in
for a sincere
expression of uh
empathy and respect
how much trouble do you think I'll get
in for that
there's a good chance I'll be canceled
this is a good chance it'll be canceled
and all of it will be sincere and I'll
still get canceled
but that would be a great way to go
I just don't want to go go out with a
whimper
right if I go out in flames
that would feel good
no matter what I just want to go out
with a big flame
but if I don't play him I'm going to be
more and more dangerous every minute so
I'm still waiting for the big takedown
are you
the big takedown
you know they're coming for me right
they have to they have to come for me
um
but the the New York
was at the New York daily news they did
their weak little attempt this week
they're going to have to come up with a
um an attack on me that's not so weak
that I won't retweet it
I don't think they can
I don't think they'll ever come up with
anything that's strong enough that I
won't just retweet it and say oh this is
funny
you do too much for the left to get
canceled
I like the way you put that
I don't like the way you put that
so one of the comments on locals was
that I do too much for the left for them
to take me out I don't do it for the
left
and I'm gonna do anything for the left
everything I do is either just good or
bad
like I'm not working for their team
the same way of not working for
republicans
have I ever done anything that's just
like for republicans
usually it's just either right or wrong
and it wouldn't matter who it was
which locals host has the most followers
that's a good I was wondering that
myself
I don't think it's me
but I could be I don't think so it's
probably Dave Rubin
uh I said I'm more left than Bernie but
that's not doing something for the left
is it that's doing something for me
by the way you've all heard me say why
I'm left there Bernie you didn't think I
could do it did you
the people who thought that there's no
way I could legitimately describe myself
as left of Bernie you were surprised
because I can
I can
um
right
I think my my favorite left of uh Bernie
was the one I said yesterday
that you know people on the right want
second amendment rights write down guns
without restrictions
people on the left such as Bernie he
actually owns a gun
so he's not against the Second Amendment
he owns a gun he just thinks they should
be you know restricted in certain ways
and I'm farther left from Bernie in
which I say registered democrats should
not be allowed to own guns
because it's what they want
if it wasn't what they wanted I wouldn't
recommend it because they have second
amendment rights too but if somebody
wants not to own a gun
I say let's make it illegal and help
them out
and let them not own guns because most
of the violence comes from Democrats
shooting Democrats
doesn't it
what percentage of the total violence in
the United States involves a republican
shooting a republican go
about none of it
how about none of it
right or or I'll even be let me be more
specific
how much of the gun violence of the
country involves a republican with a
legally owned firearm shooting another
Republican
I mean it happens
I'm sure it happens
but if the only thing you did to say you
know
we can meet you halfway I think we
should not allow gun ownership for
Republican or for Democrats
if it's what the Democrats want
give them what they want because
remember they get all of their benefits
by taking the guns away from the
Democrats they don't need to take them
away from the Republicans because that's
not where the problem was
if there's no problem you don't need to
solve it
so why don't you solve the problem
that's their problem
and the fact that Republicans have not
suggested this yet
is again very disappointing
it's very disappointing
because this is actually a real plan
it just sounds ridiculous
it's completely real if you register
Democrat
you have to give up your gum
now nobody would pass that law of course
but wouldn't you love to see somebody
put that out there and have to have
people have to have to wrestle with the
fact that all of the gun problems are
just Democrats so they can solve it
anytime they want
they can solve their own problem anytime
they want
just leave the Republicans out of it
they're not part of that problem
all right
the criminals are unregistered which is
not relevant to this point
um
Vladimir's birthday today
all right I'm gonna go out on a limb
and I've said this before but I believe
we will learn that Putin is on drugs
and that the drug of course he is
because he's a certain age everybody's
on some kind of drug by that age but I
believe we're going to find a prednisone
so I've made some pretty unlikely
predictions
but I'm going to guess prednisone and
the reason is most of you already know
this I had an experience of being on
Prednisone for several months during the
pandemic
because I was I was putting off some
surgery because of the pandemic
and I had to be on Prednisone way longer
than is a good idea
and my personality changed
and I became aggressive
and I didn't fear anything
and you don't want a nuclear power that
doesn't fear anything and that's what
Putin was Putin looks like somebody
whose aggressiveness was all that
mattered
and and his fear was none and he just
thought that going strong at things was
what he needed to do it looks like it
looks like bad judgment
fed by some kind of a steroidal
kind of thing so I'm going to say
prednisone because president's so so uh
common that would be an easy guess
all right
uh
testosterone doesn't make you aggressive
how many people would uh agree with that
that testosterone does not make you
aggressive now I'm talking about
Prednisone not testosterone I think it's
prednisone
but separately do you think that
testosterone does not make you
violent
of course it does yeah of course it is
I can't I can't believe that there's any
doubt about that of course it does
oh somebody says not aggressive but
dangerous well that's a small change I
see what you're saying there but
yeah yeah of course it does
it check the jails
dude do you notice anything about the
jails
it's full of men
it's the testosterone of course it is
what else could it be
I don't know is there another theory of
what it could be
all right I do not take testosterone but
I do have a lifestyle that promotes it I
mean because I don't drink and
I live a pretty healthy lifestyle the
only thing I should do more is sleep
more
all right and
um
obviously what was the uh oh you think
it's the additives to the food that are
causing the testosterone drop
I have a theory you want to hear my
theory about the testosterone drop
anybody want to hear my theory
um
it's social
it's social
because testosterone is
um situationally determined
now I'm sure there's also you know
chemical food related part of it and
obesity is a big part of it obesity
might be the whole thing
but
testosterone is affected by whether
you're winning or losing and in control
or not in control
and since men have went from being
almost completely in control to being
almost completely not in control
I think that testosterone drop would be
the natural the natural outcome
so shouldn't you see testosterone
dropping just based on the news
right the news says you have to act a
certain way and it drops your
testosterone
yeah so it's probably not one thing I
think it's partly environmental of how
we treat men and how men treat other
people now I'm not saying that needs to
change I'm just saying it would be an
explanation but then of course all the
chemistry the fatness the overweight the
not sleeping enough the looking at
screens
the porn
the drugs
basically every one of those things
reduces your testosterone
so it's probably I'll bet it's at least
five big effects and that environment
would be one of them
um
all right
all right that's all for now
um
and uh
I think this was another
Blockbuster coffee with Scott Adams and
it's begging for a closing zip
so that you can savor it for the rest of
the day in Fellowship in simultaneity
with the rest of us
are you ready
for the closing simultaneous up here it
goes
maybe this soy maybe soy is the problem
I think soy is one of the big five
probably don't know but it could be one
of the big five
all right
bye for now YouTube and Spotify I'll
talk to you tomorrow
