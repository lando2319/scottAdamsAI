well we got a show to do
today probably will be
amazing all the stars are lining
up comments are
working no comments are
working yes
[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome
comments are working to the highlight of
human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and there's no better time
if you'd like to take your experience up
to levels that even Tim wals will be
clapping like a seal for in a moment
when I go when I hit play all you need
for that is a cuper muger a glass of
tank or CH din a Canen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your F
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dop me end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go so
good the only thing that could make this
day better would be Tim Walls clapping
like a
seal see if we can make that
happen thank you thank you
yeah there we
go all right
cringey it's a little bit cringey but we
like
it uh if you'd like to know how to do
the Tim
Walls yeah you have to lean back you got
to put your elbows together and you got
to clap like a seal Lean Back elbows
together
and if you'd like uh a lesson on
pointing the pointing is very important
it's your non-p pointing hand has to be
limp and soft your pointing hand is full
fully mobile but the non-p pointing hand
you want to be a little bit like
this
Y and the and the
Bowing the the Tim wall bowing and the
open Palms
like he's surprised when he sees people
every time he goes to a crowd he sees
some people he's
surprised if you're only listening to
this and missing all of my amazing
Impressions oh I'm so sorry for you it
must be so sad sitting there with audio
and no visual when I am so visual
speaking of which if you need to find a
merchandise for coffee with Scott Adams
the features yes my bald head on shirts
and hoodies and
mugs uh just go to one of your favorite
search engines and search for cwsa for
coffee with Scott Adams merchandise to
buy it'll pop right
up here are some security tips for men
courtesy of Joshua Steinman you should
follow him on um onx Joshua Steinman and
uh
apparently uh uh the following thing has
happened in at least one intelligence
security
meeting some somebody looked at the men
in the uh in the room and
said I'm paraphrasing but said uh
there's nobody here who's more than a
five and a 10 if somebody wants to date
you who's a 10 it's a
spy so apparently one of the problems
with the the dating apps is that men who
can't really pull very many beautiful
women are still getting beautiful
women uh if they work in some kind of
secure military or intelligence
job turns out that there will be a very
nice Chinese woman who would be uh very
happy to be your
girlfriend and maybe you could have long
conversations about what you do at work
so here's how you know you're dating a
spy
your spy is twice as good-look as
you now it gets complicated if you're
also
Rich because then you can't
tell all right this is the funniest
story of the day and I I laughed until I
cried this morning I was sitting in my
desk just crying with laughter now I
hope this is as funny to you is this to
me now it's funny because it's real now
here's the background you you might know
that uh Jordan
Peterson was uh in some trouble with
something called the Ontario College of
psychologists now he's a Canadian and
this is a Canadian entity that has some
kind of control over the licensing of
Canadian
psychologists and if you want to remain
in good standing in in your profession
you've got to be good with this
organization and this organization ruled
that Dr Jordan Peterson uh needed to be
re-educated because of his social media
posts were so so inappropriate for
someone in their profession that they
needed to either take away his very
license to practice or have him
re-educated by a social media
psychologist
expert there are a lot of those I don't
know but he had to be
re-educated so the first thing that Dr
Jordan Peterson did was he tried to uh I
believe he tried to fight the process
you know he challenged the process and
that didn't work so now he's a a victim
of the process and he eventually decided
that he would in fact accept the
re-education
process now let me just set this up for
you it's Dr Jordan Peterson the most
famous and Poss most capable person
who's ever existed in this plane of
existence for for this domain of
knowledge and and
whatnot and now Canada's task is to find
somebody who's smarter or no more
knowledgeable on the topics of how to
communicate in the context of being a
psychologist and a social media person
that's right they're going to find
somebody who's better than
Jordan Peterson in in his chosen field
in which he's the literally the most
famous and capable person you've ever
seen in your life in any
field and at the same time better at
social media and
communicating there's nobody better at
social media and
communicating so what do you think
happened Well turns out in the entire
nation of Canada there were zero
volunteers
for this job there's nobody in Canada
who takes the job nobody in
Canada wants to be so stupid that you
that you would embarrass yourself and
have your entire professional life
destroyed by by
teaching by teaching Jordan Peterson how
to be Jordan Peterson like how in the
world do you even do that but it gets
better it gets better I can to read to
you what Jordan Peterson wrote when he
had some clarifying questions about the
process all
right this is so deliciously fun I can't
even stand it all right hold on I can't
read I'm tearing
up all right so this is from Dr Jordan
Peterson uh let's see he said
uh uh so he has some questions for the
college about uh how the qualifications
of the quote social media expert would
be determined so he asked this quote by
what
standards I'm not going to be able to
get through this because he WR he writes
it like he's being serious and he is
being serious it's hard to take you
seriously he
goes uh by what standards do you
accredit your social media experts is
that a regulated profession
are these experts also versed in the
complexities of Clinical
Psychology how else can they improve the
professional activities of a
psychological practitioner is there any
concrete published and peer-reviewed
evidence that the tender lesson the
tender lesson they pervert to provide
actually produce an improvement in the
behavior of those they
educate by what objective criteria are
you going to measure my
Improvement in that regard are there
standardized tests
[Laughter]
for are there standardized tests of such
progression how are those standards
established if they
exist oh my
God nobody in the entire country of
Canada was willing to take the
bait I would like to
know I would like to now give you my
impression of every person in Canada who
who may have once thought they were
qualified for the job of educating Dr
Jordan Peterson I now give you my
impression
this is me doing an impression you can't
tell if you're listening on audio but
it's really hilarious it's getting
better it's funnier every minute it's
getting a little bit
funnier and
see oh my
goodness so I hope I sure hope that
Canada saves Us by educating Dr Jordan
Peterson because what if he just keeps
going out there doing what he's
doing just think of all the harm he's
causing to the to the
world if not your own
family oh God please educate
him
okay I if you if you could have written
a script of a movie about that
situation and you didn't know how the
movie would end and you couldn't come up
with a good
ending there could be no better ending
than having nobody in the entire country
of Canada willing to take the job
there's no you can't get better than
that I'm sorry there's nothing if he had
like won his appeals and had it overturn
ah boring if he'd taken a class and
somebody gave it to him H icky boring
but having nobody in the country capable
of giving him a
lesson you can't beat that you can't
beat that that's as good as it
gets so maybe our maybe our luck is
changing what do you
think but here's some more good news I
got a whole bunch of good news today you
you're going to have so much good news
today you're going to be tired of it
you'll be exhausted with the good news
here's some more saw a video of a young
woman who was deaf and she was trying
out some new glasses that allow um
captions to appear on the glasses just
for the wearer so that when she's out
and listening to things she can get
closed captions on personal
conversations as well as movies and
anything else and you know they're kind
of dorky looking so you'd know that they
were you know not normal glasses but uh
they look like they could be any design
you want eventually the first ones look
a little dorky but way better than not
being able to hear in public I saw us
and watching her tearfully put them on
and being able to see sound in in the
sense of a caption uh was just one of
the most touching things now just
imagine this is a real
product I don't know what company made
it I didn't see that in the video but
just think about
that what what would a golden age look
like well one way it would look like is
that the
deaf would be able to see Sal
I mean if you were going to say what's
the Golden Age look like I I'd put that
in there I would also love to see
wokeness destroyed on under its own
weight you know sort of like the Dr
Jordan Peterson
story where you just let it play
out instead of fixing it or opposing it
you just let it play out I've taught you
the trick of embracing the thing that
you don't
like often if there's somebody who has a
terrible idea in your company or your
organization or the government if you
simply follow the rules and embrace it
it'll it'll fall apart on its own and it
looks like that's what you know Peterson
did at you know after first challenging
it anyway uh the CEO of Rumble
Rumble says that Google is burying their
search results for D banino show and
uh that appears be the case now of
course they're uh they're
competing they're competing with uh
Rumble so you can imagine why they do it
but given that YouTube has such a
dominant
position um and uh given that Google has
such a dominant position you do think
that this might be a uh some kind of a
competitive problem I don't know if it
triggers any
antitrust triggers or not it triggers a
a trigger can you trigger a trigger a
little
redundant um but here is my
advice there is a comp competitor to
Google and if you don't like how Google
and YouTube that they own if you don't
like how they're treating uh Rumble you
could use an app called
perplexity now I told you that I tried
it the other day um for I don't know
weeks and weeks people have been saying
to me almost every day somebody says you
got to try your perplexity and I
honestly just got sick of hearing
it because I thought I don't really need
another app in my life right but I tried
it I thought you know I'll just see
what's going on
here and uh so I tried it and uh if you
use the perplexity app for five minutes
there's a good chance you will never use
Google again
because when I use Google I get a bunch
of sponsored ads and then I get a bunch
of things I don't trust and it just
doesn't look like it works anymore to me
but I do get a better result within
perplexity but perplexity has its own
little uh story going on right now um
and uh I didn't know it was back by Jeff
Bezos so Jeff Bezos Amazon founder is uh
one of the backers of perplexity and
suddenly I understand why the interface
is so
good uh I can't say enough about how
amazing uh Amazon is as a
product do you do you ever have the
feeling that you go on Amazon you buy
something and it happens so
seamlessly and the entire process
including delivery and even if you have
to return something they've made it dead
easy
that Amazon is like a one of the you
know the ninth wonder of the
world if you think of the complexity in
that product and the fact that it works
so well by one
click seriously one click and I've got
something in my door um so when I think
what's the best user interface design I
always think
Amazon so if if anybody's watching from
Amazon you guys are the best you the
best interface
people
completely for what 20 years or however
long Amazon's been around unbelievably
high level of capability unbelievable
just just
mindblowing quality of Technical and
user interface
design so when I see Jeff Bezos is
backing this perplexity app and when I
turn it on I love the interface
I go oh well that makes sense I don't I
don't I can't imagine Jeff Bezos backing
a search engine that had a bad interface
he is all about the customer experience
if you've ever heard Bezos give an
interview if you if you ask what's the
number one thing that makes uh you know
Amazon work he'll tell you it's the uh
obsessive focus on the customer
experience and and he's willing to and
he did you know lose money in a cash
sense for however many years because he
wasn't focusing on cash he was fing on
the customer experience and boy did he
succeed in the customer experience boy
did he succeed I mean nothing's perfect
but wow and so it seems that some of
that magic is going over to perplexity
if you use it once it'll be hard not to
use it forever honestly it's that good
however uh somebody asked me uh but is
it full of
wokeness
yes yeah it can't be not full of
wokeness because it searching based on
what's in the real world and the real
world is full of wokeness now I did a
test this morning in which I asked it I
did the you could call it the Gilman
Amnesia test so Gilman is the physicist
who famously noticed that when a story
was about something he knew he could
tell the story was fake or just wrong
and if it was something he didn't know
he couldn't tell the difference so he
thought it was probably right so I asked
both perplexity and Google a story about
myself in which I can guarantee I know
the correct story because literally it's
myself and they both got it wrong they
both had the wrong context the wrong uh
frame for it and it was important one of
the most important things about me yeah
I don't need to get into it today but
completely wrong it was the most fun FAL
thing that somebody would mention if
they talked about me
wrong wrong to the point of being close
to the opposite of right you know it
wasn't just sort of misleading it was
about as bad as it could have been and
it's both of them because they're both
reading public information and stuff
like that I I asked
a perplexity a question about me a
separate question about me before I did
this one and uh he used as his Source
Gawker
Gawker now if you know anything about
the media Outlet Gawker is
like let's
see um if it were possible for a piece
of to itself
 so that the the turd itself could
defecate and create like a sub turd
that's what gaer is gaer is so far from
being any kind of a independent useful
Source it's like a turd of a turd you
it's it's like two levels away from
being useful and and they used it as the
only source to answer a question about
me literally my political enemies used
as a source so no so let me let me be as
clear as possible the search results
from any search engine are pretty close
to useless at this point in the world if
it has to do with people if has to do
with maybe a fact you know is is H
Starbucks is Starbucks open on Columbus
Day that I call indigenous day because
I'm not a racist like you well great
yeah it does that great but as soon as
it's a story about any human being it's
completely up yeah so there's no
such thing as searching accurately for
information about people you should just
give up on that that's never going to
happen and anyway the The Wall Street
Journal also says perplexity is getting
uh getting in some legal trouble with
the New York Times because it looks like
the times says that they're summarizing
the time stories without permission or
something like that I did ask perlex the
if it could see the contents of my books
because if Jeff Bezos is backing a
search engine the first question I have
is uh do you have access to the contents
of my books now I have mixed feelings
about it on one hand I kind of like it
you know because my books are non um
most of them are non-fiction so I would
love if somebody could just Google like
the main idea in my book and it would
pop up but you can't do
that that would be useful uh and even
though I maybe wouldn't like it as an
author it was certainly be useful but it
looks like books are kind of Walled off
so it says so it can answer questions
about what people said about my books in
the public domain but it can't actually
say in this chapter you said
that well here's a new medical
breakthrough that might be
gigantic um apparently if you mix OIC
with this other technology according to
Newsmax Health you can get rid of the
need for insulin if you're a diabetic if
you have type two diabetes you can
completely
get rid of um insulin now this is a very
small trial only 14 people but 12 of
them no longer needed um
insulin if you get 12 out of 14 who
don't need insulin when you're
done uh you could say I need a bigger
trial and you're right but holy
what 12 out of 14 don't need insulin now
here's something that you need to know
about new medical procedures can I
educate you some of you are young so
you've not had many medical procedures
but let me explain one thing you need to
know if there is a breakthrough medical
procedure it will require one of the
following things number one you will
lose all of your
hair it's depends on the medical
breakthrough you know it's not every
time you lose all of your hair but
that's a common one another one is this
will totally cure your problem but
you'll never have sex again or be
interested in it oh it'll totally cure
your other problem though the other
thing that they'll do is sometimes
they'll say this will totally fix your
problem but it will require shoving a
large object way up your ass that's the
other one so generally speaking it's
either going to make you too tired to
function you're going to lose your hair
you'll lose your dick or something
really L will be shoved way up your ass
however if you're willing to put up with
those four things they can cure just
about anything and so this new thing
that uh gets you out of your need for
insulin involves sticking uh something
way up your ass I think and then zapping
it electrically in your something in
your inner
guts so it's an endos it's an endoscope
now I think it could mean it goes down
your throat throat but given that it's
shooting the top of your intestines I
think it's going up your
butt however it's only
once it's only once I don't know if they
put you to sleep or you just enjoy the
experience but um but imagine if you
could go into the doctor's office maybe
they put you to sleep maybe they don't I
don't know they zap you for a few
minutes there's no recovery there's no
recovery you just walk out
and the ymic I assume is just so you
don't overeat um and then you're done is
this
possible is it possible that type 2
diabetes just got fixed with a five
minute
procedure is possible now I'm not going
to say that this is real you know 14
people is not nearly enough you don't
know the side effects you know you got
to do the big test
but maybe
but
maybe all right here's another
one the first peer reviewed uh protocol
on cancer using icon and another kind of
antiviral thing called
fendol and there's one like it that's
similar so uh Dr mackus says he's
already seeing incredible successes with
these repurposed drugs uh he's using in
his in his uh practice and he says icin
targets cancer cells by disrupting their
mitochondrial function just the way
you'd expect it
to I suppose um leading to cell death uh
of the cancer it also blocks Key Energy
Pathways blah blah blah so it's it's got
um several ways it can work I guess and
this Fen bendol and mebendazol they're
both anti-parasitic drugs oh I should
have said
antiparasitic so these are three
antiparasitic drugs ican and then these
other
two and they've been found to Halt
cancer cell growth interfere with
glucose metabolism trigger uh apoptosis
in somee preclinical trials and he says
remarkably three patients with stage
four genitourinary cancers were treated
with high doses of the fen benzol th000
Mig three times a week for several
months and experienced complete
remission complete
remission now this is well short of a
clinical
trial but
um today's today's uh theme is the
golden
age is it
possible that cancer just got
cured with existing drugs
they have low or no side
effects did is is type 2
diabetes cured is OIC curing
obesity is is RFK Jr going to fix our
food supply within a couple
years are we on the edge of curing
cancer did we just shoot a gigantic
 rocket into the air and catch it
with two loving arms in a gigantic
mechanized device as we're preparing to
go to
Mars are these all things happening did
the did the poles just
turn and did we find that con Harris is
unlikely to win and instead the pirate
ship of amazing people might come into
power is it possible that a doom Loop of
overspending would would be cured by the
only person we trust to do it which is
Elon
Musk uh and he's all ramping up he's
already ramping up in case Trump wins
and he would be in charge of reducing or
increasing the efficiency of the
government by reducing the waste and
that would basically put us back on the
path to
fiscal
confidence I hate to get you all excited
but everything is going our
way here's some more Google just uh made
a deal to buy the first private mini
nuclear
reactor so there's a company uh called
uh California Kos power and apparently
they can they haven't made any yet I
don't think but they're going to make
them and by 2030 they'll have at least
one and by 2035 Maybe
more and so our biggest companies the
ones that you can trust to push our
government for approval if if you and I
decided to build a nuclear power plant
we would run up against the government's
bureaucracy and we wouldn't be able to
raise money and we wouldn't be able to
get anything done in the government so
basically it just couldn't happen but
what if you're Google if you're Google
you tell the government what to do if
you Google you don't need money because
you have it if you're Google you just
change the whole world change your
search results make everybody suddenly
like uh nuclear if you went to Google
and you checked their search results
about the downside of nuclear
energy do you think it says as many
negative things about nuclear energy
risks as it used
to I don't know
but I'd be real
surprised so keep in mind Google is who
tells people what to
think
literally Google results tell people
what to think we and we've seen it it
can change your election results Etc if
Google is building its own or buying its
own nuclear energy plant what will
Google who tells people what to think
tell them what to think about nuclear
power best thing ever not only best
thing ever but required for survival
you're going to need it for AI and if
you don't have ai your country is going
to be going to be defeated by the
countries that do so it's not only a
good idea it's
essential Golden
Age if Google is all
in the America's all
in there is no such thing as America
disagreeing with Google because Google
tells America what to think that's just
the way it works
now the media if it wanted to disagree
could put up a good fight so if the
media wanted to disagree with Google and
say no we we think this nuclear power is
a bad idea well they'd be going up
against Google do you think they want to
do
that
nope how about do they want to go up
against Microsoft who who is also
looking for its own nuclear energy plant
nope do they want to go up against
Oracle well Oracle is a little different
but they don't so our most important um
companies have just told the rest of
America nuclear energy is not just good
it's essential it's coming fast and we
can't get enough of
it do you remember in 2015 2016 really
all through the First Years of the Trump
Administration almost every day I came
on social media and said everybody who
thinks these nuclear energy things are a
bad idea you're thinking of the old
technology you don't know that the new
technologies are safe they figured out
how to store the waste and even reuse it
in some cases everything solved we need
nuclear you better go fast here it
is Golden
Age yeah it wouldn't be it wouldn't be
the Golden Age unless you saw all the
big American companies go down hard in
favor of nuclear energy it's how hard
they're going at it that's the thing
it's not that they oh we're mildly
interested in it no they're committed
they're all in the biggest companies the
most powerful guaranteed it's coming now
I'm going to give you another prediction
that goes like this you can you can
predict the outcome of any nation in the
world
based on their nuclear
program that's it if you look at the
United States we started late I wish
we'd started earlier but we're really
good fast
followers so I don't think it's going to
hurt us too much that we didn't do
something 10 years ago because that
would have been 10 years ago's
technology if we're starting to go hard
today with many nuclear plants and Gen 4
in some cases and the best technology
that we have and getting rid of some
maybe some regulations as appropriate
lots of experimenting with nuclear fuels
that are better Etc uh and the uh to its
credit the energy Department in America
let me let me say this unambiguously so
over two
administrations the department of energy
in the United States has been quite
pro-nuclear power and has done very as
far as I can tell really important work
in making it possible to test newer
nuclear um processes so if you think
it's just like another bureaucracy the
department of
energy they might be
Superstars that they seem to have
quietly done as far as I can tell a
whole bunch of correct things in the
last several years across two
administrations and that counts that
counts because it means it's
Administration um robust it's it's not
going to be destroyed by getting the
wrong president in it's still going to
look good no matter who's
in so good good job on Department of
energy at least pushing nuclear
stuff um but if you look at Great
Britain they're about ready to phase out
the last of their nuclear energy it
doesn't look like they're going to go
hard to get new ones and any country in
Europe that you see phasing out their
nuclear power I would say you're seeing
the end of them as a
important
country um I think Britain doesn't have
a chance of really surviving into the
modern era without nuclear power so if
that's the way they're going you're
seeing the end of an Empire if that's
what they want that's what they
want anyway um did you know that the
appeals court uh unless they've already
ruled I don't think they have uh they
were looking into the case of the uh
half a billion dollars or whatever it
was that Trump was supposed to pay
because he allegedly defrauded banks by
allegedly over uh overvaluing the price
of his or the value of his assets now
what did I tell you on day one of that
story on day one of that
story I said whoa whoa whoa the people
in the media are idiots and they don't
know anything about business and
everything you're seeing about this
story is based on idiots not knowing
anything about business because if
you're not an idiot and you know about
business you knew that there was nothing
wrong with that story in other words you
knew that there was no reason that there
should have been a legal process against
Trump did he overvalue his assets
doesn't
matter that's what I told you because I
was a banker if you're a banker and
literally I was a lending officer I was
approving loans for lenders I was
actually not the lending officer I was
in the back office that approved the
loans made by The Lending officer so I
was sort
of I don't want to say Superior to them
but I had to I had to make sure it was
okay so I had to know what a loan is and
how it works and whether they can repay
I I had to know as much or more than the
lenders to do to do my
job and here's what I
know the bank doesn't take your word for
anything that's what I knew in the
normal course of things your lender
tells you a bunch of lies and then you
say can you back that up and if they
can't you go okay well that was a lie
and when they can you rely on the
document not what they said there is no
scenario in which a bank ever ever
relies on what A lender say or what a
borrower says ever it's never happened
never should happen Never Can Happen
never will happen and yet they're
pretending that the Trump situation was
the one time thebly relied on relied on
the statements of the borrower no they
have a whole process in which they go
out and they check the value of things
on their own because they have to
because that's their job and so the
banks were happy with the loans because
they checked it down Trump has always
paid back his loans so he's good to do
business with they made money he made
money nobody even once concerned
themselves with the fact that there was
a big difference between what they Banks
thought was the value and what Trump
said was the value it had no impact in
the real world and the systems in the
real world the banking loaning systems
guaranteed that it wouldn't be a problem
guaranteed and of course Trump would
know that he wouldn't be trying to get
away with something because he would
know it the same as the banks everybody
in business knows that nobody relies on
your impression of your assets value
everybody knows that so now the appell
court is sitting there just excor
excoriating is that the word the uh the
attorneys who brought this case and won
they actually
won in the most absurd case they won
nobody was damaged nobody had a
complaint and the people who were
allegedly damaged would be happy to do
business with them again because they
just made money and had a good
experience and the so the Appel judges
who are not obviously Soros picked
people are just saying um has this ever
happened in the history of the world
that you brought a case where there were
no victims and everybody was happy and
everybody understood the process and
everybody understood the process gave
them no risk whatsoever in this
transaction and the lawyers are just
blah blah blah blah they don't have
nothing so I don't think it's been ruled
on yet
but I don't think there's any doubt how
it will be
ruled if you're judging from what the
what questions are being asked and the
comments of the appell at court Trump's
going to get his half billion back I
don't think he paid it but yeah he I
think that just goes away I would love
to see it go away before election
day because the number of democrat
idiots
idiots Who challenged me on social media
that this was a horrible crime and Trump
should be in jail for it or at least pay
half a billion dollars for
it do will any of them come back and say
oh you know it turns out that uh being a
lending officer might give you some
experience and knowledge about being a
lending officer yes it does turns out it
does um I've told you many times that
understanding economics and I put
banking under that category uh and
persuasion are the two most predictive
skills if you understand everything
about money and I've got a background in
economics and MBA and lots of business
experience and you understand
persuasion you can often predict the
future um better than
chance so that's how I predicted that
Trump would win in 2016 it's also how I
predicted that the appell at courts if
they were honest would throw this out
while laughing at it right so so watch
this pattern the pattern is that people
understand money and business and the
people understand persuasion are really
good at predicting if you see somebody
who knows both of those things that's
what I call a talent stack where you've
intelligently combined things that work
well together that person is going to
guess the future better than other
people it it's just those two skills are
future
future oriented skills that's how they
work anyway so that's more good news uh
New York Post is reporting that there's
a Brooklyn based company that manages
some apartments in the suburbs of Denver
and they say that the fake news is fake
news and that these Venezuelan gangs
have in fact taken over their their
Apartments um now taking over might be a
phrase with some
ambiguity to it but let's just say they
can't get rid of them and if they want
to beat up one of their employees
apparently they do and they don't
necessarily pay
rent and uh so for all practical
purposes quote gangs have taken control
of several of our properties in Aurora
Colorado can we put this to
rest yeah are we
done about the question of whether it's
true the company that owns the buildings
says they're taking over and not one
multiple buildings and this is just one
management company who's saying on the
record saying in public showing you a
picture of their employee who was beat
to by the gang for I think trying
to expel them or
something can we agree that the news was
always fake when it said that the new
that this was fake that the gangs have
in fact taken over the
buildings can can we now say true or or
is there some madeup brooklyn-based
company if there's really a Brooklyn
based company that owns buildings and
they say that the gangs are controlling
them not the people whose job it is to
control
them aren't we
done arguing whether it's
real I think we're done and then if you
know what is real then you can deal with
it pretending it wasn't real was the
problem it's not that you can't can't
know how to expel people from a building
for doing illegal things if you have
to here's a story you never
heard uh this is on the George account
on
X did you know that years ago when
Nelson Mandela got out of prison um he
wanted to arrange a trip to the United
States and for whatever reason the
government of the United States couldn't
arrange appropriate transportation I
don't know what's beyond that but uh so
Donald Trump uh offered his private
plane so Donald
Trump on his own dime sent his private
jet to carry Nelson Mandela to the
United
States and today K Harris will be
calling him a racist again because they
made up some
stuff I'll tell you he might be the most
most misunderstood human being in the
world if you look and and it's very
consistent you've heard a lot of
anecdotes about him paying off mortgages
and helping people in trouble and
stopping his car when somebody was being
mugged and you know flying Nelson
Mandela um somebody said that he
attended Michael Jackson's trial every
day because Michael Jackson was friends
with his family like it the the Trump
kids used to hang out with with Michael
Jackson to like play video games and
 they were buddies they lived in the
same building in the Trump
Tower at least for a while
so it's just amazing what kind of you
know car or the the news will create of
somebody um i' like to Circle back to
social media I mentioned this without
details a few times that there is a
horrible sounding um rumor about Tim
wals that I didn't detail because I said
if it's not true I don't want to put it
out there um my best current
updated information is it's all made up
it looks like it's all made up there's
only one individual who's pushing it
it's not somebody who has credibility
it's not being picked up by any other
entity either Pro or anti- wals nobody's
touching it I'm going to call it fake so
if you see online a story and again I
don't even want to give the details
because I think it's terribly unfair to
wall he does give me a creepy Vibe and
that's a fact so I'll say that because
it's a fact about how he makes me feel
but it's not a fact about anything he's
done if you're talking about specific
you know inappropriate acts of some kind
you're really going to have to bring me
some proof all right I'm not going to
buy that based on a
Vibe so be careful be careful out that
Tim wals just be careful about what you
see on social
media all
right uh how many hoaxes are there about
uh Trump today let's see do we have how
many there's a there's a hoax that Trump
was going to use the military against
his enemies of course that's just some
weird thing taken out of context uh I
saw um did you see Jake Tapper talking
to James Carville last
night now here again I'm not going to
make a claim of fact because I wouldn't
I don't know the fact I'll make a claim
of how I'm responding to something I
watched it and Carville looked obviously
drunk and the things he said didn't make
a big of a sense it looked like
just a really drunk guy talking and
uh so I don't know if he was drunk I
just know that he sure acted drunk and
here's one of the things he said that
Trump isn't hiding it anymore that he's
a Nazi what what are you talking about
and he said it's because Trump's going
to do a rally in Madison Square Garden
and therefore obviously Nazi
what what Trump does rallies all the
time as do all politicians why would
Trump's one
rally be be a Hiller
rally well uh that's what Jake Tapper
asked Carville because it's not obvious
to him either Jake Tapper had the same
impression apparently um what uh what
exactly are you seeing about this
Madison Square Garden
rally and he says well in
1939 uh some Nazis had a had a rally in
that building now I don't even think
it's the same building I believe the
building is has been rebuilt like three
times since
then but I would like to point
out uh that building's been used
before does Carville drink so much that
he thinks only Nazis use that building
it's a sort of a public building I
believe that sports teams do things in
there maybe some of your favorite
comedians have them stand up there how
in the world
do you drink so much that you go on CNN
and say that having a rally in a public
building where everybody has ralles and
events is is proof it's not just like an
indication but it's like and then that's
proof that's proof he's a Nazi that is
some badshit crazy stuff right there and
then U then his other evidence was that
Trump said he wanted to use the military
against his enemies which you don't even
have to research that to know that
didn't happen
that's so dumb that if you spend five
minutes following politics you go didn't
happen that's some weird anti context
thing of course it is some weird out in
the context thing um so the there were
and there were two more that were just
like crazy ones they sound like
desperation uh I think it's pretty
obvious that the haris team knows that
they're they're in a doom Loop you know
they're they're circling the drain at
this point their campaign so they're I
mean they're just flailing like oh well
uh maybe uh the building he's in is a a
Nazi building can we go with that can we
can we go with the buildings a Nazi
building well how about you go after his
economic policies well that would be bad
because the the public likes his Trump's
Economic Policy well you could go after
his his policies about the Ukraine war
in the Middle East no because people
like him better on that well okay so not
the econ ICS and that war but how about
the Border yet oh no we can't go after
Trump and the Border because they like
him best uh what do we
got is he going to visit any real estate
in the next few weeks uh let's check
yeah he'll be in this building called a
Madison Square Garden perfect we'll say
it's a a Nazi
facility because that's all they
have imagine imagine sitting around and
thinking where where will we put our
limited resources
today because everything is limited
we'll put our limited resources into
this new hoax about using the military
and uh the hoax about this building
being where only Nazis
gather that is a lot of giving up right
there that you know if if you could come
up with different words for we surrender
it would look like that oh I get it
you're surrendering now so are you done
with the race no we're going to you know
we're going to take it to the election
day but it sounds like you're giving up
oh no we're fighting as hard as we can
about real estate being Nazi
indications no you're not no you're not
fighting anymore you have given
up the the eoma collapse is
today today is the middle of
February today is the day that we all
knew that the fake polls would start to
Che up we all knew that she couldn't
keep this going we all knew that if she
came out of her closet and spoke to real
people she would be destroyed and now
she's trying to make a case that Trump
is the one hiding so kamla is saying in
her in her speeches that Trump is not
doing any interviews and refused to do a
debate with her now
obviously doing other debate doesn't
help Trump I don't I mean maybe
something could go wrong but there's
nothing left to go right and here's the
thing Trump has been talking to
podcasters KL Harris says he's not doing
interviews with the major
media why would he do an interview with
the major media who is literally just
basically the KL Harris campaign she's
really saying can you do an interview
with the fake news who basically is an
extension of my camp pain if you don't
do an interview with the fake news that
will only use your quotes out of context
and edit you to make you look stupid the
same way they edited me to make me look
smart if you don't do the dumbest thing
you could ever do as a politician talk
to the main media who's going to malign
you and make you look like you're some
kind of a Nazi at Madison Square Garden
if you don't do that you must be weak
and
unconfident okay here's what's really
happening Trump has realized that if he
goes on Joe Rogan which he might do soon
or on any of these podcasts that have
huge male audiences that he is scooping
up male support like a vacuum
cleaner on ants every time he goes on a
podcast he's not being accused of being
a racist he's showing himself in his
very most relaxed basic um favorable
light and he can go from one to the
other get gigantic audiences that you'll
never get of young men on any of these
big platforms you'll never get you know
the bad treatment and it's a 100%
winning strategy especially if he closes
it out with Joe Rogan and it gets
better there is rumor not confirmed not
confirmed that both Trump and Harris at
different times will do Joe Rogan before
the election
are you having the same feeling about
that that I
am KLA Harris has only done interviews
with
friendlies now she's going to do one
with uh Brett Bear on Fox news but he
would be the
friendliest um on Fox News Now friendly
meaning that he's not an opinion person
and he does a great great job job of
avoiding opinion it it's got to be the
hardest job in the world imagine how
hard it would be to do what Brett Bear
does talk about the news on Fox
News and not you know just bias it
because all of your co-workers are
opinion people so he does a great job of
that I'm always impressed when I when I
see him work so that's the safest thing
she could
do but I
think Brett Bear is going to tear her
apart
and not because he's biased but because
she has some things to answer for that
she has not answered for and I don't
think she's that Brad bear is going to
let her just talk over him and run out
the clock I think he's going to make her
answer and she's going to look like an
idiot because we've seen her work enough
and I don't say that lightly she seems
like an idiot and that's a separate
question but imagine them on Joe Rogan
imagine Joe Rogan asking anything he
wants to Trump how do you think that'll
go pretty
well pretty well now imagine and by the
way I would expect that Joe Rogan would
ask both of them hard questions uh I
think Rogan would not want to do a
softball interview with Trump I think
he'd want to come with some fun because
it is entertainment but he's going to
come with some hard questions I I think
Rogan would make him explain January 6
in the way nobody's ever done it
I'm just guessing but I think he would
hold them to some some high
standards that's what I suspect because
he wouldn't be afraid of them that's
what you need so so Rogan would not be
afraid to ask the hard question and put
him in a spot and you know that's not
the same for everybody else um but he
would he would destroy KL Harris just by
asking questions all he'd have to do is
say people wonder about this give me an
answer no that's not the answer to the
question it should be
destroyed anyway um I also saw that
uh Harris was talking about Trump not
releasing his medical
records apparently she released her
medical records now uh Trump hasn't
since 20123 I
guess but uh Trump has asked that conell
Harris take a cognitive
test I would like to double down on that
by saying she should also take a drug
test a drug test so KLA Harris tells us
that her doctor gave her a
um yeah that uh that the doctor gave her
a clean bill of health did he I don't
remember seeing the drug test did
you did you see the cognitive test I
didn't so KL Harris has not tested the
two things that we have a question about
when I look at her in public I do not
say oh she looks like somebody who would
be at health risk in the future I don't
say that I I'm not even really super
interested in what her doctor says about
her body because it looks like her
body's fine she's young enough vital
enough she's been doing a full
campaign you there's nothing about the
campaign that suggests your body doesn't
work I'm I'm fine that she has a good
body and
Superior Superior in body to Trump
Trump's got a little extra weight
although it looks like he's losing
weight and Trump's far older so if she
wants to compete on who's got a better
body yeah yeah I'll give that to her
I'll give her the win on
body but it's not her body that runs the
country it's her
brain and if I don't know what drugs
she's ingesting while it looks like she
is
and I don't know her cognitive ability
when I can't explain why she's acting so
much dumber than she used to act I kind
of need to know those answers I'm very
curious about whether she's had a hit to
her cognitive ability because it looks
like it I don't know why but it sure
looks like it something's going on there
so uh she's pushing that and she was
pushing it I was watching the uh the
rally and she slipped from politician
mode
into uh wife
mode and I guess there's there's no you
know nicer way to say it politician mode
is most of what she says and most of
what she has said you know like I will
give you this policy yeah politician but
when she was talking about the health
differences she slipped into uh
wife like just
nagging just just the vibe and oh my god
did it turn me off like you know I I
hate to sound uh you know too
sexist but the truth is that both male
men and women have a mode that if they
use that mode it's a turnoff to somebody
right if Trump gets a little too braggy
women just go I'm out uh what are you
doing I I cannot listen to one more
second of you bragging about yourself
right that's the male version the female
version is if you get that
attitude oh he doesn't want to give us
his his health records I can't do an
impression of it but oh my god when
either of them get out of political mode
and get into
their that mode total turnoff total
turnoff all right um is it too too too
soon to say we know the 2024 election is
uh
rigged the amuse account points out that
uh Detroit reports that 40% of the
mailin ballots have already been
returned
really is so this is on a long list of
cities in Detroit and
Detroit the place that you'd expect to
be the worst managed biggest place that
there would be a problem
problem seems to have lapped the other
cities and how many ballots have been
returned early so the other cities are
in that you know 26 to 38% range but the
star is exactly the city you'd expect to
be the number one recipient of mailin
ballots if the cheat was
on it's already obvious
people now I don't have a factual basis
to say that cheating is going on and and
here it is but already we have one
statistic that would make me not trust
the election if the result were Harris
one already if you're asking me do I
accept the election of 2020 no I'm out
or or 2024 I'm out I'm already out I
don't trust the result
already so I've already seen enough
about this election that I don't trust
it now if Trump wins I'm going to
embrace it like crazy like I didn't see
any
problems and I'm not even going to
pretend to be you know
consistent because I'm going to assume
that he managed to beat the margin of
cheating I won't know that but it will
be my working
assumption so yes there's something
strange going in in Detroit and I'm
hoping that somebody's going to ask
somebody this question this week and the
question is kamla Harris and by the way
this would be a good question for Brett
Bear and it would be a good question
even better for Joe
Rogan KLA
Harris if the election result shows that
Trump wins and you see that there are
some historically out of balanc results
in other words there's some areas that
uh voted for him in numbers that
couldn't possibly be true based on
historical patterns would you accept and
certify the
result based on what you're
seeing well no NOP get back to the point
if you see obvious things that are out
of whack will you accept the election
well in 2020 well not talking about 2020
get back to the question will you accept
it if it looks an a whack to you well
it's not going to look an awack no
that's not the question if it looks an
awack
like Republicans say 2020 looked anac if
it just looks an awac are you going to
accept it well you and there's your
election there's your
election if she can't answer that
question and she
can't it's their biggest
claim that uh you won't leave office and
blah blah blah are here some more
warning signs oh by the way Christopher
rufo has found that one of Harris's
books she copied five passages which we
call plagiarism New York Times tried to
slap him down because the New York Times
wants her to win in my opinion um so
they tried to minimize it by saying oh
they just had were like five little
areas you know five little areas that
were copies ah nothing they admitted it
was
plagiarism uh but then they said that
noticing the plagiarism is racist yeah
so that's the New York Times that would
be the standard bearer of news is that
if you notice somebody plagiarized and
you prove it and you show the sections
so nobody can doubt your claims you my
friends are being a racist according to
the New York
Times all right great job Christopher
rufo well more on the ca collapse uh
Harry Anon as CNN said that there are a
lot of warning signs now going off he
says that uh if the GOP is ahead in
party
identification pretty much they're
guaranteed to win now party
identification means that you signed up
to be a Republican or you signed up to
be a
Democrat uh generally speaking Democrats
have more people signed up and when they
have more people signed up by a a goodly
amount they
win anytime it's close
Republicans
win but right now Republicans are
ahead
so Republicans this is according to
Harry Anon CNN Republicans right now are
doing even better than the average when
they
win
uh so think about
that so the the average number of people
who identify as
Republicans will give you a Republican
win if it hits the average it's above
that these signs are pointing to a
landslide they're they're pretty clearly
pointing to a landslide now what happens
if all these signs are pointing to
pointing toward Trump but in the last
hours of the election counting he loses
are you going to accept that election
I'm
not yeah let let me say as clearly as
possible if all of these signs are
pointing toward a win and at the last
minute there's a bunch of mailin votes
that counted I'm not accepting the
election let me let me say that as
clearly as I can and publicly this is a
public statement if all the indicators
or many of them indicate a strong win by
Trump and in the last minute the mailin
votes look suspicious I do not accept
that result
I want to make that clear yeah you're
going to have to you the results are
going to have to match the singles the
signals if on Election Day the signals
are all you they changed and they're all
glaring that you know based on
historical patterns um Harris is going
to win and then she does
win I'm not going to question you know
whether any specific votes were in line
or around a line even if something is
found but is smish I'm going to say you
know everything indicated she was going
to win let's let's just move on but it's
got to work both ways if everything's
indicating that Trump is going to win
and then the the Bell weathers go weird
and the last minute accounting goes
weird nope no that's a hard no on
accepting that
result all right rasmason is asking
people are you better off than you were
before uh before Biden was in office and
by a 16-point margin most voters say no
when you've got that kind of a result it
is nearly impossible for the incumbent
to
win here again another glaring sign that
Trump's going to
win so Trump has ADD on the three
biggest issues you know then abortion is
its own thing but the three biggest
issues he's well ahead which is the Wars
the economy in the
Border he's AE on are you better
off and party identification he's
ah and the polls say he he's add in
depending on which polls uh and they
haven't all caught up to the current
situation yet but he's adding like six
out of seven um swing States now let's
say things stay the same and we go into
the election and these are the things we
know and then he loses by 10 million
votes you going to accept
that I think it depends how those votes
come in and what it looks like like if
it looked like it was organic maybe
maybe
but all right
um uh Heraldo just said he's uh
endorsing U so raldo Rivera is going to
R endorse the Harris
and
uh that's because of January
6th and and uh the reason that Heraldo
says he cannot endorse Trump even though
they've been personal friends for a long
time is that uh Trump did not
acknowledge that he lost in
2020 can you believe that that that's
his reason he went public with it with a
with a long post on it it's because
Trump won't accept that he lost in
2020 and that's the one reason that's
the unacceptable
reason so I responded to
Heraldo and uh people like my response
so much I think I will read it to
you um oh and haraldo said that if you
accept Trump's statements that he won in
2020 that makes you part of what they
call the big lie so Democrats branded
January 6 and the claim that 2020 was
rigged as the big lie now the big lie is
sort of uh trying to make you think of
Nazism because the Nazis try to push the
big lie so that comes from Nazism so
Heraldo wants to know that uh Trump
would be uh a big old terrible person
for his lie and if you were to accept
his lie you're part of the nazil likee
people who would accept the big
lie okay so here's what I said in a long
post to Heraldo that people liked a lot
I said Heraldo no one knows who won in
2020 or any other prior elections our
system is designed
intentionally to not be fully
auditable we know the design is
intentional because that's how design
works if a design persists for decades
despite the ability to change it then
the design is intentional
did did JFK win fair and
square historians
disagree you can know for sure that no
court has ruled the 2020 election was
invalid but you also know courts are not
the tool for that job how would they
know if an election got hacked without
detection after years of the press
demonizing Trump as the next Hitler
every thinking person knows the
incentive to cheat him out of the
victory in 2020
was through the roof we also know State
actors can hack any system usually
without detection sometimes it requires
an Insider which is no hurdle for State
actors including our own we also know
that if someone found a non-electronic
way to cheat we would not necessarily
catch it and it appears the mail in
ballot situation is easily gained
whenever A system can be gained and the
incentives to do so are Skyhigh we
observe that such gaming happens in
every domain every
time for although I can't enter the
Dreamscape in which every thing
in our country is corrupt and broken
except our election
systems speaking as a hypnotist and a
longtime Observer of your usually wellth
down opinions this opinion does not seem
to be derived from
reason so that's my take it is not
derive from reason whatever is driving
this it's not because he thought it
through now most of us are not operating
from reason we just rationalize after
the fact but sometimes is a little more
obvious than
others all right here's some uh and I
told you that uh Harris has a new plan
for black men because she's losing with
black men not losing totally but she's
losing support from black men she wants
to give a million forgivable loans up to
$20,000 what would you call a plan to
give $20,000 loans to people who don't
have to pay it
back do you know how much theft there's
going to be in loans that you don't have
to pay
back do you know how fast I would apply
for a loan I didn't have to pay back uh
well you still have to say that it's a
loan for a business oh well yeah totally
I'm going to start a business what's the
what's your business um
I'm going to sell
uh uh I'll probably uh I'll I'll I'll
make I'll make jewelry in my house all
right that's the business uh when are
you going to do it uh well soon as I get
to
$20,000 all right can you pay it back
doesn't matter it's a loan I don't have
to pay back oh that's right we said you
don't have to pay it back all right so
you say you're going to do a
business and uh you want 20,000 all
right here's your
20,000 and then we check later how's
your business going oh
well well I just spent the money on
stuff I didn't really start a business
oh well you're not supposed to do that I
know but you know when you said I don't
have to pay it back that was really
telling me to just steal it no no we we
said we want you to start a business I
know but what I heard what I heard was
you're not going to be checking very
carefully and I can just say I started a
business and it didn't work out I just
spent your money and kept it all and you
know good
luck is basically just giving a whole
bunch of criminals $20,000 because they
asked for
it you don't have to live on this planet
for very long before you know
that this is nothing but an invitation
for a
fraud you don't have to be some kind of
an expert to see this
one uh I refer you to everything that
happened during the pandemic if you're
wondering if this will be
gamed yeah yeah it's going to be gamed
um then what else she's going to do
education and mentorship for black men I
told you that that seemed like a good
idea more mentorships good but why are
you limiting it to black
men because you're a
racist this is racist right if the
government says we're going to to do
something and you're not allowed to get
any
Whitey if anything the government says
involves not for you
Whitey then that's racist you should
just put that right in there it's not
for you
Whitey um then they got the protect
crypto Investments so black men know
their money is safe how stupid
do you think we all are because there's
some special magic that's happening to
black men are are you you so racist that
you think black men uniquely cannot
protect themselves from crypto race what
the do you think is wrong with
black men that they alone the only ones
can't figure out how to handle crypto
could you be more
condescending could you
be this is horrible this is this is the
only thing I've ever seen this racist
against
everybody it's racist against anybody
who's not included
but it's also racist against the people
included what do you think black people
somehow magically are the only ones who
can't get a like a wallet and that they
can't join coinbase they don't know how
to buy a don't how to buy some crypto
and protect it I mean it's pretty hard
to protect in crypto
but this is
ridiculous um then there's a national
health initiative to focus on illnesses
that disproportionately impact black men
I think that would make sense but only
in the context that that we should be
looking to fix everybody's problem so if
there's somebody whose problem that is
underserved yeah yeah let's do more of
it um but if there's anybody who also
has problems that are underserved why
are you only helping black
men why are only black men being uh
helped with their category of
underserved health problems yes we
should help them yes we should do
everything but but nobody else purely
racist
and then the one that's the craziest is
that they legalize recreational
marijuana to create opportunities for
black men to become drug dealers so
apparently there are some black men that
are not drug dealers but uh the Harris
campaign thinks that that needs to
change um they'll make it legal so it'll
be a legal drug but uh they'd really
like to push men into the drug dealing
business just you know legally
sounds this sounds like parody doesn't
it it it doesn't even sound like anybody
who' ever lived in this country came up
with these ideas it just sounds like a
joke it's
pathetic the word pathetic just
describes everything coming out of the
Harris campaign right now you know you
you could say that what Trump does is
you know scary or inappropriate or he
tweets are too mean all that stuff
that's true it's all true but you
wouldn't use the word pathetic would
you like if you look at Trump's lining
up you know he's got musk that will look
into the government waste he's got you
know RFK Junior's going look in her food
supply and maybe our our meds serious
serious important
stuff and then this
pathetic um you know how the Democrats
want to keep pushing these Departments
of disinform
and you can't kill them you can't get
rid of the disinformation because
they're making them as fast as you can
try to kill them uh I think Trump should
uh promote creating the department of
hoax
debunking not
disinformation the department of hoax
debunking and they use it to debunk all
of the
hoaxes now it would have to do both
sides because there are plenty of hoaxes
on both sides
but the Democrats do work on a creating
hoax model they're just doing it all the
time I think when it happens for
Republicans it's usually some Grassroots
troll that got a little too much
attention you like the like the Tim
Walls accusation that would be like a a
hoax but again it comes from an
individual and if he gets a lot of
attention it keeps going what am I
seeing here in the comments
uh response needed okay I don't know
what that's
about anyway um the department of hoax
debunking this would be a case
where you would uh embrace the
disinformation world and say I'd like to
double embrace it and when I'm president
we're going to go really hard at
disinformation and we're going to
include NBC in the list CBS ABC CNS
although CNN's moving toward the middle
in MSNBC and I would say that we're
going to declare that they reporting is
mostly
hoaxes and uh it's going to be
officially in the books as a hoax uh
entity now do you think that the
Democrats like their disinformation
organizations
now not as
much because their entire point is they
think it will only be used against their
enemies if if Trump braced the
disinformation networks and said these
are great but we need to make sure
they're operating correctly so make sure
they cover all of the hoaxes and that
they identify the the networks that are
the promoters of the hoaxes so you can
maybe guess the next one without help oh
it came from a hoax entity I get it I
don't have to pay attention to that one
yeah the minute that Trump
Embraces the hoax disinformation process
process they're going to have to
dismantle
it because they thought it only went one
way it
doesn't anyway so here are some of the
hoaxes I forgot to mention uh there's a
hoax that Nazis attended an Eric Trump
boat
rally uh there's a hoax that Trump
spaced down on stage for 30 minutes I
think somebody was it was somebody
injured in the audience so we had to
take a pause and he stayed on stage and
so they just I think they ended up not
continuing after a while so that was
just a hoax and all the news is
hoaxes um let's see what else is
happening
um do you know the story about the uh
I've talked about the the ghost trucks
I'll call them the trucks that allegedly
had were filled with fake B
from some specific postal uh service
place there was a whistleblower who said
you know he had fake ballots on his
truck but we can't find the trucks and
now um according to rasmuson account
quote uh imagine having to fight the US
Postal Service for years in federal
courts just for the names of who paid
the trucking
companies did you know that did do you
know that somebody's trying to figure
out who paid the trucking companies that
allegedly had the fake ballots on it and
it's taken two years in federal courts
unsuccessfully is there some reason we
can't know who paid the trucking
companies that a whistleblower said had
fake ballots in
it and you're going to trust the next
election now here's what I hope if we
know that this kind of process happened
once or at least there's a allegation
that happened once then can the
Republican
observers make sure that they're
observing so they could catch it should
it happen again now if it happened again
I imagine it wouldn't look the same if
it if there was any bad behavior before
they would know they needed to switch it
up but it would still have the same
element to it there would still be
trucks delivering things that were full
of things that shouldn't be
delivered so can you catch that
it depends where The Observers are and
some of them are you know are going to
be kept out of certain
places so we'll see we'll shall see well
Ukraine is uh souped up its drone
success rate that used to be down around
10% because the Russians were good at
jamming drones so they kept sending
these drones and they got jammed and
maybe one in 10 would hit a Target but
now Ukraine has added AI to their drone
so that they can fly without GPS which
means they can get to their location
they can do their own looking around and
the jamming doesn't the jamming is
applicable to the GPS so I think if you
take that out of the mix you can make it
somewhat autonomous and then the the hit
rate is up to
80% so now 80% of the drones are killing
people um that's pretty amazing and then
there's some uh there's some information
suggesting that the Ukraine the
Ukrainian
leadership is open to the trading some
land for a peace situation now of course
there are people who who debunk that
story and say no no no we're not even
considering trading land for peace but
that's the better negotiating position
you want to start from the position that
my God no I'm giving you nothing uh in
case you have to later give them
something
all right here's my update on Israel and
Palestine Palestine and the
Palestinians um I told you yesterday
that I tried to get involved in a
conversation online and I was just
trying to clarify that the two parties
were not on the same topic I wasn't even
taking a side just saying oh you're not
on the same topic and I got just totally
attacked for people assuming I'm one one
side or the other and so here's what
I've realized
I I've told you before that lying is a
bad thing and you'd all agree with that
right lying is a bad thing but there are
some specific domains in which lying is
not only acceptable it's preferred it's
preferred one of those domains is when
people ask you about your sex
life you have the right to lie about
your sex
life yeah if you're still in the closet
and that's your preference I'm not
saying it should be your preference I
I'm I'm not involved in your personal
life but if you want to tell somebody
you're not bisexual but you
are fine that that's a perfectly good
use of a lie I am 100% on your side if
somebody wants to get in your sex
business and you just want to make him
go away by lying yes absolutely lie all
you want about your sex life
there's another area in which lying is
not just okay it's advised it's advised
and that would be
self-defense so let's say the terrorists
capture you and they say do you have any
guns in the house you say no no no I I I
hate guns I'm anti-gun and then maybe
you got a chance to get close enough to
your hidden handgun that you can you
know shoot him so there are situations
in which is dangerous to tell the truth
in those cases yes lie lying is not just
okay it's
advised very advised right so in
self-defense you can lie as much as you
want now this brings us back to Israel
and the Palestinian situation what do
the Israelis believe they are
doing defending
themselves what do the Palestinians
believe they're doing
defending themselves now October 7th was
an offensive act but their take on what
they were doing you know their
interpretation not mine not mine I'm I'm
not involved their interpretation would
be it's part of a larger defensive you
know get your land back as they see it
now if you've got a situation where both
entities and this is kind of weird you
know normally there's an attacking
entity and a defensive entity take the
war in
Ukraine uh in that case um Russia more
clearly is the
aggressor and Ukraine most of us think
is the on the defense right so that
would be the normal situation for a war
there's one one attacking and one
defending but the weird thing about
Israel and the Palestinian situation is
that because of their complicated
past uh they both claim to be in a
defensive
mode now when you're in a defensive mode
as I just explained lying is not just
okay because you're defending yourself
there's there's no rules in
defense it's
advised it's not just okay it's
recommended if you're defending yourself
or right if you're defending yourself
it's recommended because you should use
every tool you should use lying you
should use bombs you should use whatever
whatever it takes there there's no rules
in
self-defense so when I as a tourist you
know blunder into this conversation
between two entities that are in a
defensive posture and then I try to
insert something that I think is maybe a
truth that both of them could agree on I
am wasting my
time because the only thing you know for
sure is that neither side should be
interested in the truth now what will
happen 5 minutes after I'm done I will
go to my DMs and several people who are
Jewish and friends of mine will say but
you know you know I hear what you're
saying Scott but you know Israelis they
do have the better argument and I'm
going to say I don't
care because if you're not in
it you should not trust anything that
either side says because they both have
a free
pass under under their assumptions of
what's true they have a free pass they
have a free pass to lie about everything
as long as they're in a defensive
posture so if Israel is lying about
everything and I'm not saying they are
that is not my claim I'm saying they
have a right to lie about everything so
do the
Palestinians under their interpretation
of what's
Happening Now what I'm not going to do
is give you my interpretation of what's
happening because it all looks stupid to
me because you can just pick some period
and pick some interpretation you could
come up with anything you want so it
doesn't matter what anybody else thinks
all that matters is who has the power to
get what they want at the
moment Israel has power to get what they
want and they're allies and we should
treat them like
allies and if they do things that we
would do and they do
it's hard to judge somebody for doing
something exactly like you what you
would
do so I don't so I'm not going to judge
either side I'll I'll leave that to
people who believe that in a contest
between two groups who consider
themselves to be on defense that you can
believe anything that's coming out of
the war zone if you believe anything
that's coming out of a war zone between
two people who are presenting themselves
as on the
defense don't do that don't do
that so now do I have a preference of
who wins yes I have a preference of who
wins because in my world um if you would
call me a non-believer let's call me a
non-believer I don't call myself an
atheist because that feels too certain
I'm simply not accepting popular belief
systems who is more likely to be on my
side in that situation
Jews yeah Jews are not tough on people
who have different opinions at least you
know the people in the United States and
people un likely to ever have any
interaction with so if if the Jewish
Powers gained power and got into a
better situation uh I say oh okay I
don't see any problem with that I I've
had tremendously good Financial business
dealings with many Jewish business
people pretty much all great I would
just keep doing that but what happens if
the Islamic World grows and starts to
encroach on my world well then I'm in a
lot of trouble so if you're asking me
who do I want to win Israel Israel who
do I want to uh
dominate well I want the Jews to be in a
superior position absolutely no question
about and it's because of
self-defense because my greatest ability
to remain free and
unbothered is to not promote a side that
would want to crush me if they had the
power to do so so I have no ambiguity
about what side I want to win I just
don't believe anything that either of
them say that's my current stand nor
should you nor should
you all right and that's all I got for
today and I'm going to talk to the
locals people privately I must have G
way over my longest one ever all right
you on YouTube and n and Rumble thanks
for joining locals I'm coming at you
sorry I'm so long
today
