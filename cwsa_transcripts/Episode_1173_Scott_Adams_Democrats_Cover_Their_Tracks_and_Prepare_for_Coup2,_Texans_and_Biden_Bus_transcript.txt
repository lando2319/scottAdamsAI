all right i think i might be live now
on both youtube and periscope
thanks for coming thanks for getting in
here
i appreciate it every time you show up
well tomorrow's the big day
we've got a lot to talk about don't we
i i see some people helpfully suggesting
restream
see this 13 000 equipment behind me
trust me when i say i have tested
every live streaming option
and i have settled on the only one that
works and it only works
eighty percent of the time all of the
other options are more like a
thirty percent of the time they work and
this one's 80
so i'll keep that all right but first
what's the most important thing we have
to do well we need this simultaneous sip
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tank or chelsea stein the
canteen joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip and
happens now go
oh yeah i feel the poles begin to
converge
with one sip that's all it took
so let me tell you why i think this
periscope works
i think this periscope meaning coffee
with scott adams and the simultaneous
is that there's something that i do
differently
from other people who live stream
do any of you know what that is i'm just
curious if it's obvious to you
what i do differently and i will tell
you
i give you a moment to see if you can
think of it on your own but
here's what i do differently i don't
treat you like an audience
i treat it like i'm talking to one
person now if you watch the news and
turn on the television
your news presenters are always they act
like they're talking to a crowd
they're talking to an audience and the
way you present to an audience is really
different
than the way you would talk to one
person now it's not exactly like talking
to one person
you know it's a little modified but i
think that's what i brought to this
the the live streaming world is
talking to you one-on-one even though i
know there are more than
more than one of you i hope all right so
how many of you have heard the podcast
just came out with sam harris talking to
andrew
sullivan you really have to watch this
you got to watch it uh or listen to it
and here's why it's so fascinating so
both
sam harris and andrew sullivan
are very flexible thinkers meaning that
they're not necessarily just gonna
agree with the side unless there are
reasons
so they're very uh two very
rational people who are not stuck in
some kind of dogma
so much so that neither of them are fans
of president trump
to say the least they're they're big
critics of president trump
but because they're also smart rational
people
they say on the podcast that neither of
them
believed the fine people hoax
they didn't believe it so that gives you
an idea that they're capable of
looking at you know data and facts and
and knowing that that matters
but despite that despite that mental
uh let's say flexibility mental acuity
that they both have
clearly both brilliant people you can't
take that away from
but listening to them talk and i want to
i want to make sure that i'm saying this
not as an entertaining insult
because we're sort of in that mode where
insulting each other over our politics
is just sort of entertaining right a
really good
string of insults against your political
nemesis
is just sort of fun and entertaining but
that's not what i'm doing here
so this next thing next thing i say do
not put your
entertainment filter on it this is
actually
literally i'm not putting any hyperbole
on this
when i listen to them talk it sounds
like a festival of mental
illness do you have that
and i have to wonder when when the left
hears
trump supporters talk do they have the
same feelings
now i'm not talking about you know on
the news
both sides like to do the trick where
they'll find the
the least informed voter from
the other side and they'll interview the
person who doesn't know
anything and they'll try to try to sell
that
as representing all democrats or or all
republicans
but uh and of course they don't
represent them they're just
individuals but
when i watch when i when i listen to
that it just sounds like they have some
actual mental issues that they're
working through and i don't mean
permanent ones
um andrew sullivan admitted on the
podcast
that after the 2016 election he
he had clinical depression and he
actually had to seek
treatment for a mental condition that he
attributes to the election
to trump getting elected that's pretty
serious
you know this this whole mental illness
thing over trump
is completely real when trump
derangement syndrome was first
bandied about and i didn't invent it but
i was one of the
one of the earlier adopters of that
phrase and people would say well you
know that's just something you say
it's just something you say to to
sort of you know diminish your your
opponents
but it isn't it's not that at all
and i don't think that i've heard i i've
seen
this kind of insanity since obama was
president
now when obama was president there were
a lot of republicans
and you know this is true who had a
little bit of obama
derangement syndrome it was a thing
but i've never seen it at this level
this is this is a whole new level
but the reasons and the things that
stand out to me
as signaling mental distress as opposed
to
good rational thinking which both are
very capable of doing
as i've said is that
at least in sam's case and i think
andrews too
they focus primarily on the internal
thoughts of trump so instead of talking
about i don't like this policy or that
policy
you know there's some of that as well
but it seems to be primarily focused on
him as a person
and sam says directly that trump's
character
is not just a quirky character that you
like or you don't like but rather it's a
you know an existential threat kind of a
bad
character somebody who's such a bad
person that they could
end the world without even meaning to do
it
they're so bad now
that was the sort of conversation that
made a little bit of sense
in 2016 because we had not yet seen
what a president trump would do but
after you've watched him for four years
don't you say you either want more of
that
or you don't you kind of know what
you're getting at this point don't you
you know in my case i got pretty much
exactly what i expected with one
exception
this might be true for you too
everything that trump did
and didn't do was pretty much what i
thought he would do
and what he wouldn't do the the wild
card was coveted
and coronavirus because nobody really
saw that coming
i mean some of the experts predicted it
but you and i didn't see it coming
and so if you had asked me in 2016 hey
do you think trump's going to be the
best choice for handling this
coronavirus
i probably would have said i don't know
peace me i mean i've never been in a
coronavirus pandemic i don't know who's
the best choice for that
i have no idea but i would say that he
maybe he wasn't maybe maybe somebody
else would have handled it better
i don't think that that's demonstrated
yet there are things that i would have
done differently
things you would have done differently
but that's different from saying that we
would have gotten a better outcome
don't quite know that we know we might
have done things differently
um but anyway so
so both andrew and sam think that
trump's narcissism
and his lack of empathy and and he only
acts for himself
and all of those things which are
interestingly
unprovable meaning that everything you
can measure
looks a little bit better for trump and
all the things that you suspiciously
you can't measure how much narcissism is
in trump
and how much is too much for a leader
they need a little bit
but how much is too much can't measure
anything like that
so anyway uh you have to watch you have
to listen to that podcast it is
genuinely entertaining
in legitimately
are you seeing the size of the trump
rally crowds
i'm kind of blown away by it aren't you
i'm not going to list the crowds because
i think he had five of them yesterday
he's got five more today
somebody says in the comments i had
meant to say this as well
that make america great again
was a great slogan in 2016 but of course
the president was playing with
turning it into keep america great again
which
didn't really or didn't really fit right
keep america great i don't know it's
just not very inspiring
but now the the coronavirus hit
make america great again now
clearly means before coronavirus
it's harder to put that historical you
know is it a secret racist dog whistle
or something
because we all want america to go back
where it was
2019. pretty much everybody wants at
least that much change if not more
so i think make america great again
turned into
the greatest slogan of all time
for the second time in a row but for
different reasons
you know the the environment served up
the perfect situation
anyway when you watch the uh trump
crowds
it's hard to imagine him losing isn't it
can your brain wrap its head around the
fact
that you look at the biden crowds and
you look at the kamala harris crowds
and then you look at the trump crowds
it's really hard to believe that he's
going to lose
with that much energy now i know what
the polls say etc
um brad bear was on i guess tucker's
show last night
on fox and he was he was saying that uh
the talk of a biden blowout
has calmed down a little bit you know a
week ago
two weeks ago people were talking about
a biden
landslide and it's just all biden all
the way
you don't hear as much of that today do
you
it seems as if right on schedule
and exactly as i predicted publicly a
number of times
others did as well that the polls are
fake
and that in order to maintain their
credibility after the election
because they can't keep that big margin
you'd see some of the polls
start to shrink and close because they
don't want to look so wrong when
when the final vote comes out sure
enough
you're seeing a number of polls shrink
then we're also seeing
i went over to msnbc because i wanted to
see how they were dealing with things
lately and over on msnbc they've got
a uh interesting article that i just
tweeted
that talks about the nightmare scenario
where uh oh wait a minute
there's actually a path for trump to win
and i don't know if they would have had
the same nature of stories
three weeks ago when they were trying to
get you know donations and they were
trying to get everybody fired up
but now they can say it so now they they
need to do a little bit of the
the cats on the roof situation
yeah somebody in the comments is saying
58 000 people in butler pennsylvania
whoever wins pennsylvania will probably
win the election
trump got 58 000 people
to show up in pennsylvania if you're
biden
and you know you need pennsylvania to
win how does that make you
feel do you feel like those poll results
that used to show you in charge
do you feel like they're still good what
about that margin of error
uh bret baer was asked about you know
why it could be that the
the polls are shrinking now brett of
course is not
an opinion guy he's a news guy which we
appreciate
about him which is that's exactly why
he's awesome
is that he does a really good job of
keeping his opinion
and of his his public statements
you know it just sticks to the news and
he was opining
yeah and this is this is fair that as
people get uh closer to election day
they stop thinking of it being just
about anti-trump
and they see a stark choice now it's
biden or trump
it's not just no trump or trump biden or
trump and that doesn't look so good
maybe
so that's you know brad had that
hypothesis
there might be some of that you know i
i'm in the same prediction
a year ago that when you're talking
about a generic
democrat running against trump that
generic democrat always looks great
but wait till you get an actual democrat
and wadel trump
sinks his pitbull teeth into that
democrat
and starts reframing them and and uh
and turning them into his his uh chew
toy
which is what he did with boy with biden
so at this point it's a real choice
against a real person
and that real person is biden and it's
not quite the
blowout scenario perhaps
but i think most of the uh correct me if
i'm wrong but
are not all of the
swing states within the margin of error
can somebody do me a fact check on that
uh i just made a claim i think it's
close to true
but that might not be true that all of
the swing states are within the margin
of
polling error somebody do a fact check
on that
or it might be true that at least there
are enough of them within the margin of
error
that that trump has a path if he got all
of those
now let's talk about that i would like
to suggest
that the idea that shy trump supporters
don't exist or that they've been
accounted for
is wrong for a really good reason
and i'll say this clearer than i've said
it in the past because i want to get on
record before the election
just in case i'm right and it goes like
this
the shy trump supporter is the one who
doesn't want their name associated with
trump
because you know might be a reputational
problem
and i've seen some democrats argue
against it like this
hey look at those rallies it looks to me
like trump supporters are proud to put
on their maga hat
and shout their support for the
president so why do you think there are
shy ones
this is somebody who's never met a
republican or a conservative
and is just so in their bubble that that
comment made sense
let me explain it to you if you put
58 000 trump supporters in the same
place
it's safe to put your hat on
[Laughter]
there are 58 000 trump supporters where
you are
you're surrounded by them you can put
your maga hat
on nobody's going to punch you totally
safe
nobody's going to dox you nobody's going
to take your picture with the intention
of ruining your life
of course of course the rallies are
going to be lit
and they're going to be extra lit
because it's all the people who couldn't
show their support
outside of the safe space of 58
000 or some number of trump supporters
now the other argument i heard which was
pure stupid
there are very few things that you can
say all right you know this is actually
just
stupid most of the time you say well i
have a different opinion or i have
different data
or i've considered more context than you
have
rarely can you look at somebody's public
opinion and say
um that one's just stupid
and it goes like this i don't know i
don't know the name of the person who
said it was on msnbc i think
uh no it was a cnn i think and it was
some expert who said the following
expert meaning pundit not really expert
but said the following that there
probably is no
shy trump supporter because the
automated polls
get about the same response as the human
being poll
and his thinking was that if a human
calls you you might lie
because you don't want that human to
think poorly of you if
you know if they're not a trump
supporter and you are
so he's saying well but you know you're
not going to lie if a computer calls you
because there's no person is that the
dumbest analysis you've ever heard in
your life
has anybody ever heard of databases
does anybody is this a pundit is he
the only pundit in the world who doesn't
understand
that if a computer calls you a home it
knows who you
are right and it knows who you are
and it's going to attach your opinion to
your identity
and somewhere that's going to be stored
in a database
now trump supporters know that
because we know what a computer is
and if a computer calls you and asks you
a question do you think that you're
saying something to the computer
and then the computer is just flushing
it and it
stops existing the moment you tell the
computer your opinion
no nobody thinks that they think it gets
stored
so if you really were worried about your
reputation
or getting on record as being a trump
supporter and you should
because democrats are directly
directly no hinting going on they're
directly saying
maybe we should round up trump
supporters after the election they think
biden will win
and they should be re-educated or
punished
so if you're in the class of people who
half of the country
uh at least people within that half are
talking about
finding your name on lists seeking you
out
and punishing you and or re-educating
you like a
chinese uyghur yeah you might lie to the
computer
i think you might lie to that computer a
little bit
all right but here's what the shy trump
support
people are missing the biggest part
of the polling error is not shy trump
supporters
okay and if you thought that i had been
saying that
let me modify that now it's not the
people
they exist i'm sure they exist people
who don't want to say the truth
but there's a much bigger group
of polling liars and it's what i'm going
to call the world's greatest
dad joke you've heard me say this before
think about it do you think that the um
and of course republicans are lying to
pollsters like crazy this year
like like they've never lied before it's
obvious anecdotally
literally thousands of people thousands
really thousands of people have tweeted
at me saying that they've lied
to pollsters now that's just people who
tweeted me
you know it's not like i did a poll and
i i scoured the country looking for
anybody who lied to a pollster thousands
of people
have just told me on twitter yeah i lied
to him lied to him yesterday
here here's a text where i lied to the
computer
and so i think the much bigger category
is the dad joke people the ones who
aren't necessarily
afraid of being on a trump supporting
list
but they think it would be hilarious
hilarious
to see more pictures of that hillary
clinton supporter screaming at the sky
after the result is known you know we
want to see that
we do want to see that that's a thing
and anybody who and the democrats are
completely blind to this
the democrats still think that a shy
trump supporter
means you don't want to admit that
you're a supporter
and they believe that the polls have
adjusted to find those people
so that now the polls have made their
corrections well we're not going to make
that mistake again
and maybe maybe they won't make
that mistake again this is a new mistake
this if i'm right and i feel very
confident about this by the way
i feel very confident that the people
intentionally lying
because they think it's funny
because they think it's funny is the
biggest category
and if this dad joke
lands and i think it's going to
it's going to be epic
it will be the best practical joke
of all time it will be talked about
for hundreds of years
for hundreds of years people will look
back in history and they'll say
you know it was the greatest practical
joke in history
that all the trump supporters lied to
pollsters
i think that's where it's going um
and the the thing that makes it a great
dad joke
just in case you're not up on your dad
joke humor
is because the um the left
has made it so dangerous to tell your
honest opinion
if you're a republican they made it
dangerous to have free speech
and so what would be funnier than
screwing them
with their own rule you know that would
be fun
right because the rule is you can't say
you're a trump supporter
did you make that rule you didn't make
that rule
that is not your rule you're simply
following the rules you're just
following the rules
and the rules say you don't want to say
you're a trump supporter if anybody asks
i mean we've been trained to do that
right
so that's what makes it extra super
delicious
is that we would just be giving people
what they asked for
demanded i would say they demand
that you not show any support for trump
they demand it
well be careful what you ask for
because you might get exactly what
you're asking for
and i think that's coming down the line
now let me say this
somebody will be right and somebody will
be wrong
somebodies will be right and wrong after
the election
you could be surprised i could be
surprised
the democrats could be surprised
surprise is the thing
right you could all be surprised
personally my head isn't going to
explode no matter what happens
and i hope that you're all at least
mentally prepared
that anything could happen let me just
say anything let me tell you the
cou2 plan kutu is the second
coup attempt which i think is well
underway and of course i'm speaking
somewhat figuratively or am i
or am i is it a literal clue
or is it just sort of a lot of people
who know what to do
was the russia collusion plot was that
an
actual literally a coup attempt
or was it just a whole bunch of people
who kind of knew what to do
you know what i mean because the the
line between a conspiracy
an actual coup and just a bunch of
people doing what
they think they ought to do it's kind of
a fine line
you know how many phone calls and
meetings do you have to have
before your bunch of people knowing just
what to do
turns into an actual conspiracy to
overthrow the government of the united
states
but here's what's shaping up number one
let me say uh the big picture is i think
democrats have
two ways to win the presidency one way
would be to get more votes
in in the electoral college so they
could win it fair and square that's one
way
but there's a second way the democrats
could win the presidency
that is the opposite of fair and square
and they have put all of those pieces
into play so the chess board is set up
right now
for the democrats for a second way to
win the presidency
after losing the electoral college vote
and it goes like this number one
make sure that your polls running up to
the election are so
fake that if the actual results are
different from the polls
you can say well obviously this election
was rigged by the republicans
or there was voter suppression or there
was something illegitimate
because it's obvious look at what the
poll said
and then look how the vote went they're
so different
it must be an illegitimate election for
trump
so that's the first thing make the polls
look fake so you'll have an
excuse later to say that the election
was fake
the next thing you do want to do is
accuse trump of voter suppression
and accuse republicans of voter
suppression so you want to get that
story out there
you don't want the first time the public
hears about it
to be after election day you want the
public to expect
republicans to cheat so that if they've
got
anything that looks like it happened
they're already primed it's like oh
i was expecting that to happen and
there's my evidence
so the burden of evidence can go way way
way down
if you've primed people to expect it to
happen
because then confirmation bias is as
good as evidence
as long as people are primed and they
have primed people for that
so let's say that trump wins according
to the
vote as it's counted they can claim it
was rigged
and then let's say it goes to the
supreme court you'd expect that to
happen right
so it goes to the supreme court and
let's say that the supreme court
wanting to protect its own
its own credibility um doesn't want
biden to get elected
because biden will you know pack the
court and make it
basically a non-credible institution
that was
in the pocket of the presidency and the
senate because they can just add people
to get any result they want
so will the supreme court vote to make
themselves irrelevant
because that's what backing abide in
presidency would do it would make the
supreme court irrelevant
or it would risk it we don't know
exactly what biden will do he says he's
going to do a commission
but what if kamala harris is the
president
that could happen pretty quickly after a
biden win
so you would expect the supreme court
not only because they're conservative
majority but also because they don't
want to make themselves
obsolete that they would back president
trump
so whatever the question is you know
does this vote count or
can these votes be counted or is the
election done or do we have to wait
whatever the questions are that go to
the supreme court let's say they go for
trump
which seems reasonable so now the
democrats would have set the table
by the fake polls
they would tell people that trump's
going to cheat
they would tell people that the supreme
court is not legitimate
because it's packed with conservatives
and now what would they do well
that's not enough right you you need a
little extra
that wouldn't be enough to pull off a
coup because people would still say well
you know the supreme court said it so i
don't like it but i'm going to live with
it
all right here's the other part
if president trump travels outside the
white house
or he gets um let's say there's too much
of a threat
and he has to leave let's say 10 000
antifa supporters surround the white
house
could happen right could you imagine ten
thousand
twenty thousand uh angry protesters
surrounding
the white house two scenarios
one scenario is that the president or
the first family
are in the white house the other
scenario is that he's on the road
and he's traveling if the angry crowd
reaches the defenses and starts you know
taking a move on the white house to
actually occupy it
if the president or the first family are
in the white house
you would expect that the security which
would be quite extreme i would imagine
could shoot to kill am i right now test
all of these
uh all of these assumptions because i
may be wrong in my assumptions i'd need
somebody like a
you know like a dan bongino somebody who
actually knows what they're talking
about
to tell me if my next assumption is
correct and it goes like this
if the crowd of protesters outnumbers
the security forces
it doesn't matter how much the security
forces
you know fight them with batons if
they're outnumbered they're outnumbered
so if you get enough protesters
without without deadly weapons they can
just sort of overwhelm the defense
of the white house now if the president
is in the white house
the security can start shooting am i
wrong about that
because that would be an actual risk
against the president and i think that
would be a real risk
they wouldn't have to shoot everybody
but they'd probably shoot a few people
and that would probably be enough to
stop the
stop the um the attack
so am i right so far that if the
president's there they would use deadly
force
to keep the crowd away from the
president now supposedly
suppose the security
says we have to get you out of here mr
president and putting you in the
underground bunker isn't good enough
because you don't want to be in the
bunker below the white house if the
white house is occupied
that'd be the worst place to be so we're
going to have to get you out of here
get on this helicopter helicopter goes
or let's say the president was just on
the road
for business if the white house is
unoccupied
by the first family and let's say the
people work there know enough to get out
of there so it's basically an empty
white house
would the security forces protecting it
be allowed to use
deadly force to protect an empty
building
you see where i'm going here i feel as
though
if the building is ever empty during
whatever
you know problems we have after the
election if it ever becomes empty
of the first family that the
crowd if it's big enough and it might
take you know
thousand twenty thousand people or
whatever if it's big enough
could they occupy the white house
because i don't see
american security services slaying
a bunch of people for property
am i right we don't see them killing
people to protect
property and as valuable as the white
house is
if there's nobody in it it's property
so does anti-fun know what i just said
yeah they do
of course they do they've been planning
for a while do you think that they're
going to try to surround the white house
if trump wins
100 100 they're going to do that
if the president's not there let's say
they occupy the white house
right now you can imagine that can't you
all it would take
is a big enough crowd and the first
family not being there
that's all it would take because i don't
think we could ever put enough security
there to stop
10 or 20 000 people coming over the wall
without shooting without deadly force so
what happens and here's here's the punch
line what happens if the crowd
gets control of the white house the
democrats get the senate
they hold the um the house
and they and the trust of the supreme
court
is diminished what can they do then
all they have to do from that point on
is get the mainstream media
to say biden is the president that's it
that's it and it could be enough
because the mainstream media we
we've seen that they can brainwash the
public into any damn thing
they would believe anything so
if anti-fog got control of the white
house the media
declared that biden was the president
and he goes back in because antifa
controls the white house
um it could get really ugly
it could so i would look for where is
the president going to spend
election night and i believe he said he
might move it to the white house
and i would think it might be because of
that
somebody's saying scott nobody's smart
listen to you
all in capital nobody's smart listening
to you
somebody's commenting in all capital
letters nobody's smart
yeah and if if anybody shoots a
protester that's a bad look as
as you're saying uh somebody saying tear
gas i don't think so
i i think that the tear gas wouldn't
slow him down
somebody says dogs again not enough of
them
and dogs would be violent
somebody says we've been telling you
about the mainstream media for years
well i think we all knew what was going
on there
militia no i don't think there'll be any
militias around the white house
anyway let's talk about some other
things so and then the last part of that
is the 25th
amendment so you could imagine that
the senate and the house if they were
all democrats
if they had democrat control they pushed
the 25th amendment
control the white house do something to
get rid of pence i
i suppose and just pretend the biden won
it could happen i don't think it's going
to happen i think
trump will win i think there will be a
legal battle
and then trump will just be president
and there'll be a lot of complaining
trump said he plans to claim victory
actually he didn't say this publicly but
there are reports that he's telling
confidants
that he'll declare victory on tuesday
night if it looks like he's ahead
do you think that's a good idea do you
think trump should declare victory on
tuesday
knowing that there are lots of votes to
come in by mail
do you think you should declare victory
if he's ahead
now of course the the criticism is that
that would be a destabilizing thing
and it would be like a dictator trying
to take control
when he knows that there are more votes
coming in and they could change
well um i'm gonna have to back trump on
this one
strategically he should claim that he
won
if it changes he can make a second
decision
so there's you can always make the
second decision
i claimed i won more votes came in
they look like they're credible uh darn
it i guess i didn't win
so i you know i concede so he could
always change his mind there's nothing
that stops that
but going first really matters so if he
claims victory
and the votes uh temporarily indicate
that
whoever goes first in claiming victory
has like a little bit of an
advantage because it's harder to say no
you didn't
than it is to say i won so if if trump
goes first and says i won
if the numbers support that temporarily
it wouldn't be the final number
i think it's just a good strategy
psychologically
to sort of make to to be first and make
the claim and let people argue against
it
the fbi is investigating the uh
the texas incident with where biden's
little bus
his biden bus was surrounded by trump
pickup trucks with flags and
uh in at least one case one of the
trucks made contact with a car that
might have been a biden car or something
so we don't know whose fault that was i
saw the video of it
it looked like the truck's fault but you
don't know the whole story
the video can be misleading um
so they're they're investigating that
but if you're a trump supporter how much
do you
laugh or enjoy the fact that uh
texas pickup trucks ran biden's bus out
of texas
he had to cancel the rest of his stops
in texas how much do you like the fact
that it happened
even though maybe you don't condone it
right
so i would say i don't condone
you know any any kind of dangerous
vehicular activity if there was anything
dangerous
but i enjoy it i kind of enjoy the fact
that somebody did it i just think it's
funny that they chased him out of texas
um i tweeted a
new analysis of mask effectiveness
what do you think you said so there was
a new meta-analysis
which means they looked at a number of
existing studies
and what they did was they said we have
this criteria for which studies we will
look at
so they're not looking at anything from
2020 they're looking at mass
research and studies from before 2020
and they picked
only ones that they had decided there
there was a criteria that they had
decided
would be a good enough study now the
reason you do a meta analysis
is that you don't trust any individual
study so you're not going to trust any
one study
you're going to look at a bunch of them
and see if they if the bunch of them
lean in the same direction or not so
that's what the meta study does
and they did an embedded study so which
means it did not include
um controlled randomized studies it was
a number of different things they looked
at different types of studies
and they came to this conclusion that
matt the use of mass
mass by health care workers and
non-health care workers
can reduce the risk of respiratory virus
infection by
80 80
so when they looked at the studies they
say masks work
and not only do they work they work a
lot eighty percent
it doesn't matter if you're a health
care worker or a non-health care worker
it works a lot so that's what the
studies say
now do you believe that somebody else
could do another
meta-analysis of masks and that their
meta-analysis would show exactly the
opposite
the masks do not work of course
i haven't seen one but can we say with
complete confidence
that probably there exists doesn't mean
it's right
but probably it exists somebody who did
a meta-analysis
and found out that if they look at all
the good studies
it shows they don't work don't you know
that exists
now i'm on the pro mask side of things
in terms of
saying that they work whether you should
wear them as a freedom question which is
different but in terms of whether they
would work if you wore them
my my common sense
my judgment says almost certainly yes
nothing's 100 but it feels like
certainly yes
um so
we have one other experiment that gives
you a little more information
south carolina without trying to do an
a b test did an a b test and i've been
calling for this before i kept saying
where is my city that's just like
another city
where one wears masks and one doesn't
and they were in the same place with the
virus at the same time and
everything looks demographically similar
and then you can see
do the masked people get a good result
and the non-masks don't
but you gotta you could have to be
careful about picking
you know an apple and an apple so that's
always the problem getting an apple and
apple but south carolina
has sort of a natural version of this
certainly far short of scientific
standard
because you can't really control your
comparisons that well
but so south carolina there were some
places where they had mass
mandates and some places they did not
and here was their result so far that
the places without a mask mandate so
when they didn't wear masks in south
carolina in some parts
there was a over a thirty percent
increase in the
coronavirus infections so thirty percent
more infections when
where they didn't wear masks but where
they did wear mass
they saw in overall cases dropped 15
is that convincing that's a pretty big
effect right
difference between 30 increase versus a
15
decrease that's pretty big
so but again is that a scientific
comparison no you would need a lot more
of these to
to be confident that you were seeing
something all right
so i would say that while we cannot get
to
mass certainty um i would say that the
the weight of evidence seems to seems to
be
in favor of them working somewhat all
right
uh let's talk about some hoaxes
there's a a hoax picture richard
grinnell
tweeted this looks like a hoax a biden
wearing a mask in public but then he's
on an airplane talking to somebody not
wearing a mask
the hoax debunkers tell us that the
mask-less picture is from 2019.
so so that's probably a hoax if you see
the maskless
and then the mask to biden there's
another hoax where
uh there's a video of biden forgetting
what
state he's in which he's really done a
number of times
but this one was edited so there's a new
one where it looks like he forgot the
state
but he didn't so those are two uh
two things all right um
and uh here's the last thing i want to
talk about
so somebody challenged me in comments
because i had said you know where's
where's a james comey to talk about the
biden
allegations of hunter biden and
china and ukraine and all that and i had
stated that
if there had been if the fbi or the news
had been more forthcoming instead of
disappearing that story
then it might have changed the result
but somebody pointed out and this was a
perfectly good question
that i i'm also on the record as saying
that when comey
did his press conference in 2016 about
hillary's email
that i've said that didn't change any
votes so how can i be consistent
in saying that comey talking about
hillary's emails didn't change any votes
but i do think that if there had been a
comey talking about
hunter biden and joe biden's connection
that that might have changed the vote
and here's the difference nobody cares
about a
technical infraction of email servers
that's sort of just something that
people talk about in the right wing
i've never met any democrat who cared
about hillary's email server
because even if it were true i guess
it's true that she had an email server
that violated some
regulations or rules or laws or
something it just
never rose to the point of being
terribly important
i mean in my mind it was very similar to
you know the software packaging taking
off the thing and
you know agreeing that agreeing to all
the software
restrictions but you didn't really yeah
it's sort of a technical thing i don't
think it would have moved anybody
and none of that turned into anything in
other words there was nothing on the
emails
that later turned into something of
substance so even at the time
you know even when the when the story
first came out
i said that's not going to change
anything people don't care but
a story about somebody being influenced
by china
i feel like that would change votes
whereas an email
technical problem you know even though
there's a real thing to worry about
we never we never discovered the thing
to worry about
um
all right somebody's telling me masks
get filled with
fungus and bacteria and all that yeah
you know i'm not
discounting the fact that there are some
downsides to masks and downsides to
shutdowns and downsides to all that
i'm just saying that
by and large if you want to get rid of
the pandemic
masks are probably a big part of it let
me tell you what i think is the
uh the school of the future and what it
looks like
now that we're doing these these
terrible zoom classrooms
you can get a much better idea of what
school should look like because once
everything breaks
you can start thinking about from
scratch here is what
school of the future would look like
number one
instead of having your teacher the same
one that you would have walked to school
and had in a classroom teaching you over
zoom
you would have the best teacher in the
world teaching
everybody so there would be one best
teacher for
geometry and everybody would have that
teacher
now or it could be one or it could be
any best-selling teachers
who have created content that might be
recorded
so it doesn't have to be a live teacher
it could be the best recorded lesson of
a geometry lesson
of all time then maybe you still need
some teachers assistants to answer
questions and stuff
but imagine it's the best of the best
teacher
how different is that from your average
teacher
and more importantly how different is
that from the bad teacher that they get
in the inner city because they don't
have a good tax base
can't pay people as much it's a big
difference
there's we are on the cusp of an
enormous improvement
in education but right now we're captive
to the teachers unions so as things
stand right now
after the pandemic we'll go back to the
same bad system that has been failing
for years
of kids being bored and going to class
so instead
here's what i see as the future you will
have theaters
instead of classrooms so it'll be like a
little theater with a big screen
that everybody watches the same screen
instead of having their own little
laptops they might have their laptops
too but they'd be watching the big
screen at the same time
and you would go there with kids your
age who are taking the same class
so the number one big problem with zoom
school is that the kid doesn't get to
leave the house
doesn't get to see their friends doesn't
get any social
life now we can't do that with the
coronavirus but as soon as that's over
it would make more sense to get rid of
regular schools
have a place that you know the the fifth
graders
can go to where there's some adult
supervision not necessarily teachers
and they can watch the best education in
the world
talk among themselves form groups do
their homework
etc and i think that something like
amazon
will be the source for that i think
amazon will be selling
the world's best you know best-selling
lessons
for three dollars so for three dollars
the entire class can get the best lesson
ever created on this topic it's going to
be a big deal
and then the the last part of this is i
think we have to get rid of the
antiquated
uh degree situation where you can get a
degree
in russian literature a degree and this
or that
i think that needs to be replaced with
something like a talent stack
model where you might not have something
that would technically be a degree
but you've you've accumulated a bunch of
learnings
that fit really well together and so
you've created like a super power
with your talent stack so there's got to
be some way to
to get credit for having developed a
talent stack
whether or not there's a degree that's
associated with that all right
somebody said that's called a resume not
really
because your resume is a little wordy
and if you say
i have this skill but on top of it i
have this skill
you still have to work a little bit to
understand that they work together
but if you said here's my talent stack
here are the things that i think work
well together
that would be a pretty strong package
all right so that's
where i think we're going with this
unless the teachers unions
screw us again and i'm going to try to
join you tonight i don't know for sure
but i'll try to join you tonight i
understand that some of you can't sleep
unless you
hear my calming words on these these
dangerous times
i do have by the way one a threat
against my house
for election day so
there's some online indication that
there might be some trouble at my house
i would like to suggest that if anybody
was planning to create any trouble at my
house
that you should really rethink that
because it would be a really bad
bad idea all right that's all for now
and i will
talk to you later
