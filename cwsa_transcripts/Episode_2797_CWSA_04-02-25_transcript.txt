are. We better check the stock market
here because as you know it's the tariff
liberation
day. See how everything
looks. Stock market is a little
royiled. Got a little bit of green and a
lot of
red. S&P 500's down a little
bit. All right. Well, let me get my
comments going here and then we can have
the show you
deserve. Yeah, it's the one you
deserve. Not the one you get, it's the
one you deserve.

Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott
Adams. You've probably never had a
better time. But if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that nobody
can even understand with their tiny
shiny human brains, all you need for
that is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker gels in a canteen jugger flask. A
vessel of any kind. Fill it with your
favorite liquid. I like coffee. And join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine dinner of the day. The
thing that makes everything better. It's
called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right now. Go.
So
good. Well, you probably heard by now
actor Val Gilmer has tragically died at
age 65 from pneumonia in Los Angeles. I
don't have anything to say about that,
but uh when people who are younger than
me die, it bothers me a little extra, I
have to say.
So,
uh, uh, rest in peace, Val
Kilmer. All right. Uh, shall we do some,
uh, fake news? Let's look at some fake
news. Uh, according to Futurism, Maggie
Harrison Dupra is writing that after a
single concussion, kids are 15% less
likely to go go to college. Does that
sound like real science to you? After
one
concussion, kids are 15% less likely to
go to
college. Do you know what else could be
behind that
number? Could it be that smart kids get
fewer head
injuries? I'm just asking.
If I showed you a bunch of
mathletes and they were standing next to
a bunch of
athletes, the athletes probably are
going to break their heads a little bit
more often. And the mathletes are
probably going to be joining the band
and maybe working on the I don't know
the
uh working on some clubs.
I I hate to be uh all
stereotypical, but I'm pretty sure that
intelligence is highly correlated with
protecting your head. What do you
think? Yeah. Do you do you think that
people of all intelligence levels are
equally likely to wear a
helmet to ride a bicycle? It's not been
my
experience. My experience is the dumber
you are, the less likely you'll wear a
helmet when you're riding your
bicycle. Anyway, I thought that was
funny.
Well, the Wisconsin Supreme Court
elections didn't go the way a lot of
Republicans wanted it to go. So the
Democrat Crawford won, which means that
there will be likely some reortionment,
which
means Wisconsin will uh subtract some
Republicans and add some Democrats to
the House, which
means the Republicans could lose the
majority in the House. Now, I don't know
how close it is to guaranteeing that
that will happen.
How close are we to guaranteeing that we
lose the majority or Republicans lose? I
is it just very
likely or is it guaranteed
now? Cuz anything could happen. But
let's talk about why that
happened. Why the heck did that happen?
Um the according to The
Hill, they say that Elon Musk might be
toxic to elections.
Charlie Kirk says that the low
propensity voters
uh a lot of low propensity voters voted
for Trump, but if Trump's not on the
ticket, are they really going to show up
for, you know, a local election? That
might be part of it. I I think a lot of
it is that the Democrats had nothing
else going for them. So they had this
one thing that if they could find this
clever way to sort of beat the system
that they wouldn't have to act like they
live in a democratic society. They'd
rather live in a lawfare
driven kleptocracy or something. So they
found this little weasly way to win if
they could put all their energy into it.
But they didn't have anything else to
put energy into. They had no policies,
no no ideas, but they sure like this
idea of reortioning so they have power.
So some of us do that with the fact that
nothing else was
happening and so they could put all of
their hopes and dreams and energy into
this one little weasly thing. And I'll
tell you, Democrats love weasly
 It's like lawfare. Sign me up.
uh reaportion to win.
Absolutely. So it's all trickery,
trickery and
schemes. Um so but do you think Elon
Musk is toxic to elections and that that
might lead to the
midterms? Do you think the midterms will
go poorly because of Elon? Well, that
might uh the interesting part is that
he'll be done with his
role. It's supposed to only last 130
days. So, he'll be done, I don't know,
for the summer or something. And he
thinks he can get his trillion dollars
of savings before he's done. Now, if he
does that, if he succeeds, and you know,
the major news sources agree that, okay,
he did he did find a trillion dollars.
didn't think he could do it. Will that
still make him
toxic?
Well, maybe. But it seems like after
he's no longer working on the
government, isn't it going to be harder
to say it's his fault? Because the
actual cuts are going to be made by, you
know, cabinet heads and group leaders
who are in the government. So, are you
really going to blame Doge or Musk if
they get a trillion dollars and every
one of the cuts, every one of them at
this point would be approved by people
who, you know, are at least
uh most of them I think have to be at
least approved by Congress before they
can get in their
job. I don't know. It could feel
completely different in six
months. Just the fact that you don't see
his face associated with it all the
time.
And and the main thing is um when it
comes to Democrats, I saw Dr.
Insensitive Jerk on
uh on on X saying that uh you won't
understand Democrats until you
understand that
they that they're thieves and and they
they like letting people out of prison
and they like, you know, prisoners
having freedom because they relate to
the thieves.
That's pretty that's pretty
harsh. But it does seem a little bit
like when you show them a let's put it
this way. It seems to me that Democrats
are about transferring wealth from
people who made it and Republicans are
about creating wealth. So you got one
party that creates wealth and that's
their main thing and one party that
wants to just take it away from them.
Uh, I don't know how that how could that
even be a thing, but it feels like
that's what it is. Well, today's
Liberation Day, April 2nd, and the
President Trump will be announcing at uh
400 p.m. I think in East Coast time um
from the Rose Garden, he'll tell you
what exactly the tariffs are going to
look like. Will they be just straight
reciprocal? Will they be uh done with a
scalpel or a or a
jackhammer? Um it doesn't matter what he
does. The press is going to say they
hate it because you know what else they
have to do except say they hate
everything he does. So we'll see how
that goes. That's what's uh roing the
stock market today.
the stock market's going to going to
react to the
uncertainty. Now, Israel
uh quite cleverly got out in front of it
and dropped all their duties and tariffs
on American goods. To which a lot of us
said, "Wait a minute. They had tariffs
on American
goods. Uh, I thought they were our
friends and they had tariffs on American
goods. They weren't very high and it
wasn't there wasn't much of it. So, they
they didn't give up much by giving up
their tariffs. But it's so smart to do
it before the tariffs kick
in like like given that there wasn't
much money involved and Israel is very
free market oriented. It was just a
clever move to get ahead of it and you
know be one of the first let's call it a
victory for Trump because sure enough he
threatens and uh and Israel just says
okay we'll drop ours. So that's how the
negotiation is supposed to work. India
did the same. Somebody says I haven't
seen that in the news. Did India drop
all of its tariffs? I think they only
reduced
them. So, I'll have to check on that.
But give me give me a fact check on
that. Did India drop their tariffs in in
anticipation of uh the US tariffs or did
they only adjust them downward? I think
they only adjusted them downward, which
would be not
nothing. So, we'll see how that goes.
You know, the the funny part is people
are still treating it like it's intended
to be permanent. And it doesn't matter
how many times it's explained. No, the
point of this is to not have tariffs.
The the end goal is that we don't have
tariffs. They don't have
tariffs. So, we'll see. Um, unusual
Wales on X, that's an account on X, um,
said that tariffs to the tariffs would
add as much as $10,000 to the cost of
the average new home.
What do you think of that as a data
point that the costs of tariffs, the
extra cost would add
$10,000 to the price of building the
average new home? Now, that's per
CNBC. Here's what I say. What's the
first thing I teach you when they show
you a number without a
percentage or a percentage without a
number?
What does it mean when the news gives
you a number without the percentage or
the percentage without the number?
Because you don't know how much the
average house costs to build, do you?
You don't know if that's 20%, 2%, 1%. Do
you? So this is propaganda or just
really lazy lazy work because uh I had
to go to AI and say what's the cost of
the average house and somewhere in the
somewhere in the 300,000 range would be
the average cost of a new house. So
$10,000 added to that would be about 3%
extra.
Now, would it be fair to say that now
that we know the number and the
percentage, would it be fair to say that
the tariffs will add
3%.
No. No. Because the point of the tariffs
is not to leave them in place. The point
in point of the tariffs is to negotiate.
So, what we don't know is where it all
shakes out. But what we do know for sure
is that nobody, including the
administration, plans for them to be
permanent and to just add costs to the
US
consumer. So everything about that
estimate is
misleading. First of all, that it would
last and or even ever, it's possible it
will never even touch us because maybe
things will happen so quickly. It's
possible. And the other thing is it's
3%.
10,000 sounds like a lot.
3% I don't know that you would notice
it. Would you on a on a
house? I mean, nobody wants to spend 3%
more, but would you even know the
difference? If I told you that the cost
of a new house was 300,000 blah blah
blah
versus the first time I ever talked to
you about it, I told you was 3%
higher. It wouldn't make any difference
to your decision, would it?
3%. Almost certainly
no. All right. according to uh Mario
Knoff and he's
quoting he's quoting somebody named Alec
uh Stap.
So I guess Mario thinks this is a real
number. Uh maybe it is, but the stat is
that the US is now producing 50% more
oil than Saudi
Arabia. Does that sound right to you?
Does it sound right
that the US makes 50 or is producing 50%
more oil than Saudi
Arabia? I think I'm going to need a fact
check on that one, too. If it's true,
it's amazing.
So uh I guess Saudi's uh share of the
world oil has declined
steadily and
[Music]
uh anyway so that so that would US is
leading the the world accounting for 16%
of the total global
output whereas Saudi is 11% and Russia
is 12%.
Now, if this is
true and it's newish, I also don't know
how newish it is, but if we suddenly
have created a surge in in oil
production, wouldn't that tell you that
that would make a bigger difference to
lowering prices than the tariffs might
have to increasing
prices? If it's
true, let's see. I've got
Yeah. All right. So, I'm not even sure I
believe that. It sounds like almost too
good to be true. Well, as you know,
Senator Corey Booker um he broke the
record for talking nonstop
uh in Congress or at the Senate.
But they're calling it a talkathon, not
a filibuster. Because it's not a
filibuster because he wasn't trying to
stop any particular
legislation. So why was he doing
it? I don't know. I've been watching
this news for like two days and it's a
headline story. I don't I don't even
think the news told us why he did it.
I feel like he just needed some
attention and he so he just put on a
play. What are we going to do? I don't
know. How about I put on a play and I'll
pretend to be the very tired senator who
cares a lot and talks for 25 hours and
breaks the
record. And I'm thinking it's it's pure
theater.
There's there's not even a specific
thing he wanted. Somebody said they had
something to do with
immigration, but what exactly is he
disagreeing about immigration?
So the ridiculousness of it, the
complete weakness of it can only be can
only be beaten by the fact that
apparently his really good friend who
works for him sometimes. Uh was led into
the building around the security check
and then later he told people he had a
gun. He was immediately arrested because
no guns are allowed in the Senate. Uh
but there's a little it's a little
unclear whether Senator Booker is the
one who escorted him in because it seems
like Booker was probably just at the
podium most of the time. Um or somebody
else did. But uh I think it was reported
as a member of Congress led him in and
led him around the screening.
Why does anybody get to go around the
screening? If you're the security person
and a member of Congress says, "Oh, this
is somebody I know really well. We're
going to let him go around the
screening." I would say to you, "Uh,
isn't that the most dangerous person who
came to the building, the one who has a,
you know, somebody who's going to take
him around the screening? Why would you
ever let anybody do that?
So, first of all, I'd probably fire the
security people for allowing a member of
Congress to take anybody around the
screening, especially when you find out
later they have a
gun. Now, apparently there was nothing
dangerous about it, but I mean, he
wasn't threatening anybody or anything
like that, but uh that's just
crazy. Now, do you think that's bigger
or wor is that a worse problem than Mike
Waltz fat fingering? Probably. We don't
know the exact story, but however, he
invited Jeffrey Goldberg accidentally
and then he saw some plans for the
attack, which they don't call plans for
the attack. I don't know. I think these
are both nothings. You know, they both
led to nothing. Nobody got hurt.
you know, could have been a problem, but
wasn't. So, I'm gonna I'm gonna treat
this, you know, the the friend who
brought a gun in. I'm going to treat
this the same as the Mike Waltz thing. I
don't really think, you know, even if
Booker is the one who who took him
around the uh security, we don't know
that, but even if he is, I don't think
Booker should be, you know, resigning. I
don't think Mike Wall should be
resigning. These are just tiny little,
you know, human problems. They were
dumb. You know that I'm not not
defending any of it, but not the biggest
problem in the world. Well, meanwhile,
CNN and uh Harry has some new numbers
that are bad for Democrats.
So according to a new poll Quinn
Quinnipc
uh Democrats opinion of their own well
actually the entire voters's opinion of
Democrats in Congress is 21%
approval. Now this is Democrats in
Congress. So it's not about the party of
Democrats just the ones are elected in
Congress.
And
uh only 40% of Democrats approve of
their own their own uh bunch of Congress
people. It's the lowest approval on
record for
Quinnipic. So So even though the
Democrats had a good day yesterday in in
Wisconsin so they can do their little
reortionment scheme,
um they're not doing so well. By the
way, there were also uh there were some
elections in Florida, some special
elections, and the Republicans both won,
but not by as much as people thought
they would. So, it kind of everything is
sort of suggesting all the special
elections are sort of suggesting that
the Republicans have some weakness
uh whenever Trump is not on the ticket.
So that that could be a bad signal
coming up. All right. So yesterday I
didn't know during the show that Bill
Maher had already had dinner with Trump
at the White
House. Um
and there's a little bit of feedback. I
think Bill Maher is going to talk about
it on Friday on his show. That will be
interesting. But uh the the dinner was
Bill Maher Trump, Kid Rock who set it up
and Dana White who was just there
because he's a good dinner date I guess.
And I was thinking to myself, how could
that not be
fun? I mean, just think about it. Bill
Maher, Trump, Kid Rock, Dana White.
There was no chance that that could be
anything but a good
time. But here here are the the little
bit of stories we've heard from it.
We'll hear more.
Um, I think I heard this on Guffeld uh
that uh that Bill Maher brought with him
a list of insults Trump had said about
Bill Maher over the years and handed it
to
him. So, what do you think Trump did
with it? The list of insults that Trump
had used against Bill
Maher. What's the funniest thing that
Trump could do? He autographed it and
gave it
back. He signed
it. Now, how much do you love
that? And how disarming is that? So you
you're Bill Maher and you're coming in
with, okay, these are all the things you
said about me, which, you know, in
itself was kind of a humorous thing to
do. But I think I think Trump topped him
by signing
it, especially if he hadn't been asked
to sign it. It's funnier if Bill Mah
didn't ask him to sign it and he just
said, "Give me a
[Laughter]
pen." Oh, that was funny. But apparently
a good time was had by all. They got
along and there was a um little guided
tour of the White House and even the the
private residents. That's the good
stuff. People don't get to usually see
that. And then we learned that Bill
Maher, the Democrat that he's been
forever, has never been to the White
House. You even I've been to the White
House. there there's so many like
podcasters and you know Republicans of
all kind who have been invited to the
White House generally you know because
the president wants to you know make
sure you're on board and just work the
crowd a little bit but uh Bill Martin
never been invited but here's here's the
kill shot now we might hear more about
this but this is what we know so far
that apparently during dinner Trump
asked Bill Maher about Mar's opinion
about uh Iran and Israel and the Middle
East. Now, what I was looking for was
the kill shot. The killshot is where
Trump, who has crazy charisma, he can
turn to anybody in person. Like, you
cannot dislike him in person. It would
just be so hard cuz in person, I mean,
he just glows. I I had the experience.
um you just want to be talking to him
and he never runs out of things to say.
He always gives you full attention and
treats you like you're the only person
in the room. But here's the kill shot.
Imagine being Bill Maher and you think
of yourself as basically a well-informed
political
comedian and then the most powerful and
important
person maybe in the world, the president
of the United States looks at you and
says, "What do you think I should do
about the Middle East?"
And you might actually have some ideas
because you've been thinking about it
and you're well
informed. I can tell you what happened
next because I experienced
it. Whatever Mar said, unless he just
said a joke, which I doubt, so maybe
we'll find out about that later. if he
gave him any actual advice or and
treated as seriously like, you know, I
think the only thing you can do is this
or that, I guarantee you that Trump gave
him his full
attention, listened to him completely
without
interrupting and then, you know, maybe
commented on his comments or something.
Do you know what that does to a
person? I I had that experience where I
I've told you this story before. It's
not really private. Um, when Trump asked
me who I thought would be his running
his running opponent the next time he
ran because I saw him in 2018 and I said
I thought it would be Kla Harris and
then, you know, he said he thought it
would be uh um Biden. So, he was right.
But when the president of the United
States asks for your opinion and then he
listens for the answer like he really
actually no joke in the real world
wanted to hear your
opinion. The power of that is
incalculable. So I expect Bill Maher
will try to act like nothing happened.
You know, like there were two
adversaries who had a good dinner and it
was fun, but it doesn't change anything
about how he feels or how he's going to
act or how hard he's going to be on
Trump. I I imagine that that's the look
we're going to get. But I'll tell you
that experience will change you and
that's one of the superpowers that Trump
has. He can ask He can ask for your
opinion, treat you like you're the only
one in the room and your opinion matters
and you'll never be the
same. You'll never be the same. It will
just change you forever. It's it's it's
like an incredible
thing. Anyway, do you remember a while
back, it was in 2020, there was a study
that went all over the internet that
said that uh black
infants uh have a lower survival rate if
they're cared for by white
doctors? How many of you remember that?
I remember it. So, that's that would be
pretty horrible, right? so racist if if
black infants didn't do as well if they
had white
doctors. So, uh, guess what
happened? Turns out somebody looked at
the data and found out the data was
maybe not so reliable. And here's why.
There was a little bit of a selection
bias. And
this it's so it's so bad. science is so
terrible. Here's what the selection bias
was. There are more white doctors in the
specialties where you you go to those
specialties because somebody's might
die. So the white doctors were in the
sort of dangerous jobs, more of them.
There were more of them. So that it
looked like when you went to a white
doctor, you'd have bad
outcomes, but you would only go to those
specialists who just happened to be more
staffed by white doctors if you were
already in in dire trouble, right? So it
might be the oncologist or, you know,
heart surgeon or something like that. So
all it was was they had they didn't
select, you know, an equal set of black
doctors and an equal set of white
doctors. The white doctors were more
often in specialties that involved, you
know, more dangerous kinds of
situations. And that's all it was. And
if you once you corrected for that, the
difference kind of went away.
Now you know even if you didn't know
that what was the the credibility you
should have given the study from day one
as soon as you heard it the answer is
none from from the first time you heard
it without even knowing what the problem
was you should have said oh it's one of
those here's why half of all this these
studies half are not
reproducible, meaning that it's a coin
flip, whether it's real or not. Even if
it's
peer-reviewed, there's a 50% chance it's
not reproducible, meaning it was never
valid in the first place. Now, if the
question is sort of a yes, no, which
this is, do the black babies do as well
if the doctor is a different race? Yes
or no? Right? It's it's like a coin
flip. It's yes or no. Under those
conditions, when the studies themselves
are only 50% reliable, what is the
difference between doing a
study and not knowing if it's
reproducible and flipping a
coin? Because it's just going to be yes
or no, heads or tails. And the answer is
there's no difference. There's no
difference between that study even if
you didn't know that it was flawed. At
the very at the start of it, you should
have said, "Well, that means nothing."
Now, it could become it could become
meaningful. Let's say if the study were
reproducible, that would mean something.
Suppose other people did studies in the
same domain and got similar
answers. Well, now you have my
attention. you know, as long as it's not
all being funded by one kind of entity
that has a has a horse in the race. But
no, when you first hear a study like
this, it's just a coin flip. It means
nothing. Here's another one. Uh, lab
grown meat. I saw this in the internet
today. Lab grown meat potentially worse
for the environment than retail beef.
So, this is uh told to us by an account
called No Farms, No Food.
So it's an
entity that is sort of
pro-farm which means probably not
pro-lab grown
meat and uh they say an interdep
departmental study from the University
of
California University of California
uh concluded that lab grown meat may be
up to 25 times worse for the environment
than natural pasture raised cattle
retail beef.
Now, here's the first tell that
something's a
miss. The the
poster that's
ProArm did a screenshot instead of a
link. So, if I wanted to click and see
the details of the study, couldn't do
it. So, that's your first, you know,
that's a that's a little uh signal
there.
Um, secondly, we don't know who funded
the study. Was it big
meat? I mean, who else would fund it? Is
there anybody was there anybody else
even going to look into it? I don't
know. So, if you don't know who funded
it, you should ignore it.
Um, and then again, you have to put it
into the context of the studies being
50% false anyway. So, I don't know. I
don't know if any of that's true, but
it's a low
reliability. Speaking of low rei
reliability, Katherine Herage and number
of other people um reporting about the I
guess we have some new information about
the internal deliberations at the FBI
during the time that the Hunter laptop
story was breaking. And the news is that
the
FBI knew that it was real, but they just
shut up and told everybody to shut up
about
it. Now, did you have the same
experience with this story that I did?
If you already heard it, that didn't you
think, didn't we already know that
everybody in the government was lying
about the laptop and that they knew it
was real?
I I had trouble figuring out what was
the new
part. Maybe I just assumed it, didn't
you? Is there even one person listening
who thought the FBI thought that that
was
fake or the Department of Justice or or
or those 51 intel people who said it
looked like Russian dis Russian I don't
know craft or something like that. I
didn't think that there was anybody who
thought that was real. I didn't think
there was anybody who thought it was
anything but real. I thought we knew
everybody in the government was lying in
every capacity in every place, including
the FBI. But, uh, I guess Katherine
Herage is going to do an expose with or
a deep dive um with Michael
Shelonburgger. I don't think they've
worked together before, so this could be
interesting. And uh so they got newly
released FBI chat messages and basically
people were told to stand down and shut
up about
it. But
again, why does it feel like it feels
like I saw the future or something,
right? Because I kept reading and
thinking, didn't everybody know this?
Didn't everybody know the FBI was lying
if they were involved at all?
Stop
acting uh stop acting surprised that the
FBI lied to
you. Well, the New York Times has
inexplicably written a uh very long
story about the US involvement in
Ukraine. I guess this was yesterday, the
day before.
And it it kind of reveals what all of us
already knew again. So this this is like
the same thing I said about the last
story. Didn't you already know that the
US was deeply involved in creating the
situation that caused war in Ukraine?
But now the New York Times is revealing
to us through their
investigation that yes, the US was very
involved. But what they were keying on
here is that uh the targeting
information was coming from uh US people
at a German military base and that even
General Millie was directly involved in
planning for the planning for the
Ukraine military and there were even
troops on the ground. US troops on the
ground in
Ukraine, presumably
advising, but I would think helping with
targeting and I would think helping tell
people which button to push on the
weapons if they're American
weapons. And so, so again, I asked the
question, didn't we all know that?
Is there anybody who is watching this
who didn't know that there must have
been US military people sort of embedded
with the Ukrainians from day one? I just
thought everybody knew that. So now it's
a big story in the New York Times and
people are like,
"What?" But seriously, in the comments,
didn't you all know that we had boots on
the ground from day one? Cuz that's the
way everything works. You don't have to
know about
Ukraine. You just have to know anything
about the United States. And and
anything about the United States would
tell you. Of course, we had people
pretending not to be our military who
were our military. might have been CIA,
might have been just special forces or
something, but they just take off their
outfits, dress like Ukrainians, which I
guess dress like Americans, and
uh they're they're just training them.
Maybe they're just training
them. This is the least
surprising story of all, but there's
some speculation. I saw Jack Pabic
talking about it and uh that the uh New
York Times might be trying to maybe
cover their own asses or or get ahead of
the fact that there will be more coming
out so it doesn't look like they didn't
do their
job. So I don't know.
Um, so apparently the US has been
directly involved in a war with Russia
the entire time, which again, I thought
everybody knew
it. None of you were surprised,
right? It's just how we operate.
Anyway, so now that there are multiple
offers for Tik Tok,
uh Wall Street Journal is reporting that
uh Trump is going to be briefed on all
the offers and make some kind of a
decision. But here's my question. Isn't
it up to China? If China says you can't
sell it or Tik Tok says it, but really
we would imagine that China was banned.
And I don't think China's going to sell
it. So if I had to
predict, I think that that China would
eat the billions of dollars of revenue
that they could have made, 50 billion or
whatever it is. Um because a lot of that
would have go to the investors. It
wouldn't go to China. If you were China
and you knew you were going to lose
control of Tik Tok in America anyway,
just
America, would you sell
it if you thought you had a little money
involved? You know, maybe a billion here
or there, or or would you just say, "No,
we'll just uh go out of business in
America and just sell it everywhere
else." I think China is not going to
approve the sale. So, I think Trump is
going to have to kill Tik
Tok, which China would be challenging
him to do because you know how unpopular
that would
be? That would be super
unpopular because even Trump has said
he's Tik Tok. So, I think that China is
going to want to corner Trump and put
him especially during the tariff
situation. They're going to want to
corner and embarrass Trump by saying
hard no, we're not selling it. So if you
want to put it out of business, that
will be you, Trump, putting it out of
business. So explain that to all the
small businesses who go out of business
because they lose their Tik Tok
access. Uh it would be a nightmare. So,
I feel like Trump may have accidentally
walked into a trap that he set
himself. How in the world does he get
out of this? So, that's my prediction.
China will be a hard no on the sale and
they'd rather embarrass Trump into being
the one who kills Tik
Tok. I think that's where it's
heading. Apparently in uh New York State
uh there was uh some kind of a big
strike by the corrections uh
professionals and uh so there there
weren't there won't be enough or there
were not enough people to operate the
jails. So what they're going to do is
release a whole bunch of prisoners. not
not the most dangerous ones, but they're
going to release some massive amount of
prisoners that should be in jail just by
saying they don't have
jails. They don't have a staff to manage
it. So, I guess the corrections officers
have been on strike since February. They
don't like the forced overtime and tough
working conditions. To which I say, why
did you why did you ask for a job in a
prison? What? Why? Why? Imagine asking
for a job in a prison and then
complaining about the difficult working
conditions. What did you think it would
be like when you decided to work in a
prison? Did Did you think you'd have a
nice cubicle and a and a and a window
view? It seems to me that job would be
the hardest job of all jobs, you know,
and also the most
dangerous. So, I certainly understand
why they'd go on strike. I just don't
understand why they take the job in the
first
place. Well, meanwhile, uh, Project
Veritoss has a new undercover video.
um involving the NASA and the State
Department in which the employees are
saying that they're not getting rid of
DEI, they're just rebranding it and
they're going to defy Trump's uh orders
on DEI being
illegal. So, they said they cancelled
their DEI stuff, but people just did it
and called it something else. They work
around the
rules.
Uh what do you think's going to
happen? Do do you think that the
Department of Justice, I guess it would
be them, Pam Bondi, would come after
them when the undercover the undercover
uh investigation shows that they were
just lying and they were just continuing
to racially
discriminate, at what point do you go to
jail for
it? Because it's
illegal. If you're if you're doing a
scheme so that you can continue
illegally discriminating against white
people, is there no jail for
that? You know, at what point is it
jailable? You know, maybe is it a civil,
you know, you get sued for it, you lose
your funding. What exactly is a penalty
for that? Because if there's no penalty,
nothing's going to happen.
But uh apparently racism is very
important to NASA and the State
Department, at least parts of
it. Well, according to The Hill, Tim
Walsh's daughter has decided not to go
to grad
school. It turns out the daughter might
be as dumb as Tim Walsh. So, listen to
her reason for not going to grad school.
Um, and she announces on TikTok that
she's not going to go to grad school
because she says there's a a lack of
support, at least in the school that she
wanted to go to, for the right to
protest a higher education institutions.
She said, "I I applied for one school.
Uh, I kind of had my heart set on it. I
am not going to name the institution,
but given the recent events, I'm not
going to give my money, go into debt
for, or support institutions that do not
support students and the right to
protest and speak out for their
communities.
So that's why she's not going to
graduate
school. So, she's destroyed her own
career because she thinks she doesn't
have free speech on a college
campus. I'm not entirely sure this was
about free speech, was
it? I thought it was about uh gross
anti-semitism. Was anybody complaining
about free
speech? Because I don't know that free
speech protects you from a level of
anti-semitism that pretty much
guarantees there's going to be violence
attached. I don't know. Tim Wals's
daughter.
Uh I don't think you don't think you
made a good decision
there. Well, let's check in with the
Department of Imaginary Concerns. As you
know, Democrats have a lot of drama and
a lot of imaginary concerns. So, we're
going to check in on those. Uh,
imaginary concern number one, Elon Musk
is not
elected. That is an imaginary concern.
Now, it's true he's not elected. You
know what else is true? There are only
two people in the executive branch who
are
elected. Just two. But I haven't given
you the percentage yet. Remember, number
within a percentage is
misleading. Uh, but there are about 2.4
million federal government workers. I I
think those are just within the the
president's um
domain. So, of the millions, let's just
say a few million. Um, of the millions
of
workers, only two of them are elected.
the rest are you appointed or in some
cases Congress had to agree. But the
vast majority of people who work for the
executive base, the vast majority like
99.9999% are all
unelected. So the unelected claim is
both true, but it it belongs in the
domain of the imaginary concerns. We'll
put that with uh things that could have
happened but
didn't. Anyway, here's another one.
Uh there's a
uh there's a Yale um
professor who said uh I think this was
on MSNBC. They're interviewing a Yale
professor who's going to leave the
United States for Canada because he
fears that Trump is implementing fascism
and he wants to, you know, highlight it,
make a point. So, he's a
professor of fascism. So, he's a he's a
scholarly expert on fascism. Now, what
happens if you're a scholarly expert on
fascism? Do you notice a lot of it?
Yes, you
do. What would happen if you were a
scholarly expert on
ghosts? Would you see more ghosts than
other people? Yes, you would. Suppose
you were a scholarly expert on
narcissists. Do you think you'd see more
of them than other people? Yes, you
would. You'd see them everywhere.
So whatever you're the scholarly expert
on, you're just going to sort of be
primed to see it everywhere. But what
examples do you think are there? Because
you've been hearing it too, right?
Trump's a fascist. Trump's a fascist.
What exactly are the examples? So, I
went to Grock
um to find out what Trump is doing
specifically that his critics would call
fascism. And here's what Grock told me
fits under that cate category of
fascism. And what I want you to look for
is is this the sort of thing that looks
like confirmation bias? Meaning if you
were the Yale fascism scholar expert,
you could interpret all of this as
fascism. But if you were not
crazy, you could interpret it as just
ordinary stuff. All right? So the first
indication that Trump is a fascist is
his America first policy.
If you happen to be the Yale fascism
scholar expert, well, that's a pretty
big signal that you're going to be a
fascist. If you were a normal person
who's not bad crazy, you'd say,
"Oh, you mean like every country
does?" Is is there a country that
doesn't put themselves
first? Well, maybe Great
Britain. Maybe maybe France and a little
bit of Germany at that point.
But do you don't you think that
countries in general should manage their
own situation
first with you know with an eye to the
fact that they have to work productively
with other countries. So taking care of
America
first and doing things like making sure
that our uh our tariff situation is at
least
reciprocal. Is that what makes a
fascist?
Only if that's how you're primed. If
you're not primed to see it, it just
looks like ordinary. The most obvious
ordinary thing that the president has
the country in mind first. Here's
another one. Trump pardoned the January
6ers, which would suggest that he is,
you know, in support of violent
insurrectionists. Hm. But that's just a
media narrative. It's not true. What's
true is it was a protest. It's not true
they were
insurrectionists. So if you believe they
were insurrectionists and he pardoned
them, well, I could see how you might
think, well, that's a little too far.
But if you happen to know that the media
and the Democrats cooked up this
horrific scheme to hunt and jail
Republicans, then you would say, "Oh,
well, this is
justice." What What part of justice is
fascism? And has not has not Trump also
pardoned over time a lot of other people
who were not bunch of white Republicans?
He
has. So, so looking at pardons, because
pardons are always sketchy, you know,
every president who does pardons does at
least a few that you say,
"What?" Um, so pardons, I think that's a
crazy standard. How about strict
immigration policies? Again, this is
from Grock trying to give you examples
of how Trump is a fascist or his critics
would say it. Grock is now saying it. um
strict immigration
policies. That's just common
sense. That's literally just protecting
your country from what? Criminal
Venezuelan gangs and degradation of the
workforce in the United States or at
least the pay for it. How in the world
is that fascist to not let other people
come in and take your stuff?
Um then Grock says uh Trump has a uh he
he has a rhetoric that talks about
toughness like oh break those heads and
you know we might involve the military
to do this but that's just talk and it's
just how it gets reframed. If you said
to yourself that's just how he talks it
means nothing. If you say to yourself,
well, that's the only the only people
who talk like that are fascists because
you're the Yale fascism scholar expert.
Well, then suddenly it looks like
something, but it's so
thin. Then about
uh Trump makes attacks on the media. So,
this is on Grock's list of why Trump's
critics call him a fascist. Attacks on
the media. Well, if you thought that the
media was fair and honest, then
attacking it would look a little
fascist. And do you think that the Yale
fascism scholar expert believes that CNN
and MSNBC, he was actually appearing on
MSNBC?
He was appearing on
MSNBC and didn't notice that the entire
media landscaped is so biased that
attacking it is just common
sense because they're in many cases just
completely lying. And there are plenty
of examples where the media just ran
schemes that they ran plays against
Trump and they knew they were doing it.
We know they knew they were doing it.
So attacking the media makes sense if
the media is worthy of attack. And boy
are
they. Uh uh and then then Grock says uh
that on Twitter Trump allegedly praised
Hitler. Okay, I don't need to tell you
that never happened, but there it is.
That's what Grock says. No, that never
happened.
And then they're saying that uh Trump
made racist stereotypes of
prosecutors. Did he? I think the racist
stereotype, if he did anything, was that
there's there's a coincidence to the
type of people who were coming after
him, which we all
noticed, which is not a racist
stereotype. It's more it's more a
complaining about people being racist
against
him. Now, uh and then the summary is
that Trump likes nationalism,
suppression of disscent and
authoritarian
government, suppression of
dissent. What What part was that?
Attacking the media. The media are
liars.
is is it's suppression of misinformation
maybe by by arguing
back and authoritarian government. What
makes an authoritarian versus
effective? Where's the line between
getting stuff done and being an
authoritarian? Does the authoritarian
ask Kidrock and Bill Maher to go to
dinner? Uh, it seems to me that this is
one of those framing
hypnosis cult situations where if you've
been trained to see the world through
the eyes of everything's fascism or it's
not, then you could sort of talk
yourself into it. But no, the evidence
um
is
purely open to interpretation and I
don't see it.
But once you're a ghost hunter, you're
going to see a lot of
ghosts. Um, according to the the Daily
Signal is writing, Tyler O'Neal, that
Tesla owners, not connected to Doge,
just people who own a Tesla, are
acceptable victims according to 31% of
Democrats.
So, roughly a third of Democrats uh in a
poll
um said that attacking people who simply
owned a
Tesla, which would include, you know,
probably half of them are Democrats or
leading Democrat that they would be
acceptable
targets. Now, remember I told you that
uh Democrats are
basically thieves
um and they're looking to take things
from people who have things. That
includes Democrats who have things. So,
if anybody has nice things, you're going
to find a lot of Democrats who are
willing to take it away. And I don't
think it goes deeper than that. So, I
think that probably 31% of Democrats
can't afford a Tesla.
So, if you say to them, "Hey, how about
these people who can afford a Tesla or
even just afford a car, uh, what do you
think of them?" And they're like,
"Ah, I think they should be victims just
because I don't like Elon Musk." But
really, is that the reason or is it just
because they can afford a nice car and
you
can't?
So, that's crazy.
Um, I think in general that people who
don't have
money are in favor of violence against
people who do. Do you think that's a
good generalization? People who don't
have
money and don't expect that they're
going to make any in any legal way are
going to say they're going to be open to
violence to take money from the people
who have it because everybody wants more
money. And if you can't figure out a way
to make it
yourself, maybe you'd rather take it
from people. Um, I I had the experience
of going from a low income situation to
a high income situation and I can tell
you that while I thought my character
was improving and my
morality as I got
richer, all I re I eventually realized I
was protecting my own class.
Like I got I became really
anti-rime when I had money that people
could steal from me. But when I had
nothing and I saw somebody maybe ripped
off a rich person didn't bother me a
bit. Is it because I used to have low
character and then I developed a
conscience and higher character and
morality and ethics? No. probably just
made more money and then joining the
people who said you shouldn't attack
people who have more money because they
earned it
themselves. So the difference I think
with Republicans who don't have money
and Democrats who don't have money is
that Republicans who don't have money
are more likely to think but I could
have money if I worked harder and did
all the obvious things that people do to
make money. So, they're not thinking, "I
want to steal things and go to jail."
They're thinking, "How do I work harder?
Where's my mentor? You know, where do I
get a foot in the door so I can make
something of myself?" I think the
Democrats are more likely to think that
the system is rigged and uh they need
some reparations or they need some
basically they need the government to
take money from the rich and give it to
them.
And whether you deserved it or work for
it, none of that matters. They just
don't have money, other people do. So,
they're trying to figure out ways to get
it. And if you can make the government
be your your uh criminal enterprise,
which is what Democrats have done, you
notice the Democrats have turned the
entire government, you know, through
USAID and all the NOS's. They've turned
the entire thing into a criminal
organization to take money from the
people who have it and give it to
themselves. In many cases, they're rich
and they're still doing it. So, there's
that.
Anyway, here's a story that sounds like
you've heard it before, but it's
actually just a third one like it.
There's yet another law firm that Trump
went after um because they had been
involved in uh investigating the January
6 attacks and some other stuff. And uh
see, this one is called uh Wilky Faren
Gallagher. So Trump was getting ready to
go after them, but they cleverly got
ahead of it and they said uh that
they'll provide the equivalent of $100
million in pro bono legal services for
causes the administration supports. Now
this is the third major law firm um to
offer a gigantic pro bono, you know,
kind essentially bribe, could you call
it a bribe? Um, they don't call it a
bribe. Let's not call it that. Uh, but
here's my question. So, pro bono means
that nobody would have to pay for it and
they would do a hundred million dollars
in legal services
for Trump related or Republican related
uh
areas. Now, here's my
question. Do they put the top lawyers on
that kind of proono work?
Are you going to get the A+ players or
are you going to get the the lawyers
that maybe won't make it with the law
firm and you know they're junior and you
know well we could say we tried but you
know we put our we put our lawyers on it
and we did not prevail but uh I'm going
to call that $10 million of legal
service and nobody's really going to
check that it was really $10 million of
legal service and they will burn through
that 100 million commitment in no time
at all and they will probably not win a
single
case. They they'll somehow you know like
you know it it seems to me that the odds
of them giving the a team to the pro
bono work for the other side is really
low. Really low. So, I'm not so sure
that this is a real victory,
but it's fun. All right, here's a
question that I can't wrap my head
around. Um, it doesn't seem like that
long ago. We were talking about China
was in terrible trouble because their
demographics are bad. They don't have
enough young people. Uh, they're full of
bureaucracy and they can't get anything
done. And you know, they might have a
lot of debt and they build a bunch of
cities that they're just knocking down
because it was a waste of money and
they're stretched kind of thin
everywhere and they're they're getting
ready to collapse at any moment because
the US is moving it manufacturing out of
there etc.
On the other
hand, it seems like the United States
doesn't know how to make anything and
China has entire industries of people
that they've trained in the art of
making stuff. So, if you wanted to build
a manufacturing facility in the United
States, you'd have to find somebody who
knows how to do that. and there aren't
that many compared to China where I
think it's a major and and you got all
these, you know, armies of trained
engineers and everything else who just
know how to build a manufacturing plant.
So, how do you compete with that? That
we've got our kids who can barely read.
Every time there's a new report coming
out, it's worse. So, China is educating
its kids. We're not. Um, it feels like
we stopped being able to invent things.
Yeah, only a few things have come out
recently. Um, mostly AI, but China's AI
is seems to be cheaper and open source.
So, if they keep their AI almost as good
and cheaper and open
source, how do our big companies that we
think are the are the jewels in our
crown, how do they even survive? How how
would um chat GPT survive if it's
competing against just as good and
almost
free? I don't know how. And I don't
think that China is going to, you know,
suddenly start charging for AI or at
least charge you more. Um suppose
there's a war.
the smart people. I think Naval said
this recently. Uh whoever has the most
drones that are, you know, least good
enough to be uh in military. Whoever has
the most drones is going to win every
war because they're going to be all
drone wars and whoever has the most is
going to win. How in the world are we
going to have more drones than China?
China will instantly go to complete
military dominance because they can
manufacture. They can just make drones
all day long and they would have rare
earth minerals and they would have
everything they needed. They wouldn't
need anything from
anybody. So that's
crazy. So here's what I can't tell. Is
China in trouble? Do they have debt
problems and, you know, population
problems and bureaucracy and they can't
get anything done? Or have they become
this
competitive monster that we'll never be
able to match militarily,
technologically, or manufacturing wise.
And if we can't match them as a
economy, then eventually they
will dominate us. And it seems like
there's nothing we could do about it. I
saw a uh post by Hotep Jesus on X and uh
Hotep Jesus is funny because he says
things that you're not supposed to say
in
public, very provocative things. And I
don't have exact quote, but I think he
said something like um if you're not
expanding your empire, somebody's going
to basically expand onto you. So you
don't have a choice of just staying the
same. In this world, that's just not an
option. You can be growing and growing
your empire or somebody else is going to
grow their empire and take yours. Those
really are the only two choices. Because
if you look at any any civilization that
was thriving, they were usually
conquering at the same time. you know,
whether it was Rome when it was growing.
Um, China right now is looking to, you
know, conquer, it's already conquered
what, Tibet, and now it's going to
conquer Taiwan. It's already conquered
Hong Kong. So, China is growing and it's
looking to dominate the the oceans
around
China. It's
expanding. Russia is expanding. it got
bigger and in a pretty important way and
we don't know I mean it doesn't look
like he's done uh he just added more
people he just he just increased the
size of his army substantially uh Putin
did and then the United States
um we're looking to pick up Greenland
and uh maybe something about Panama and
maybe even
Canada. So when you see Trump uh overtly
trying to
expand, don't feel like that's a risk to
the United
States. Think about it in terms of there
are only two ways that big countries can
go. They can keep expanding or they die.
Somebody else expands onto them. So,
uh, you know, maybe Europe is the only
place that's operating the opposite and
it looks like they're doomed, right? So,
I don't see anybody in Europe who's
trying to expand their country. Instead,
they're looking to give it away through
mass migration.
So you should be able to predict that
Europe is doomed and that uh the US,
Russia and China are still expansionist
countries and we might, you know, come
to blows with each other. Um I think
we'd be smart enough to avoid world
wars, but those are three healthy
competitive situations if we don't go
broke from
debt. Anyway, Russia says it won't
accept a US ceasefire proposal because
it doesn't give them what they want,
which is no NATO in uh Ukraine and um
something else. Some kind of security
guarantee. No, what is it? What are the
same ones? They want to I don't know,
consolidate the land that they've
already gotten and make sure that
there's no NATO and blah blah. So, but
I'm going to go further. I don't think
that Putin's going to say yes to any
deal. So, I hate to predict this because
I would have Well, I did. I predicted
that Trump could wrap up the Ukraine war
fairly quickly because I thought to
myself, well, he's just going to say
there's an obvious deal to be made.
Russia keeps what it already got. Uh
Ukraine doesn't join NATO. But as it's
shaping up, I think I'm going to bet
against any kind of a peace
deal. Um, I wouldn't bet that we'll
necessarily stay supporting
Ukraine, which maybe isn't the worst
thing that could happen.
So, I'm going to say that there's not
going to be a Ukraine peace deal. And I
don't think Putin wants it. I don't
think Zilinski wants it. I don't think
the European Union wants it, but the US
wants
it. Uh, so I think we'll just bow out. I
I think maybe we might sell weapons to
people want to buy them, but I think
Europe's going to have to cash the
check. So, yes, no peace deal in my
opinion. It doesn't look like anything's
pointing in that direction.
Um, according to Tech Explorer, there's
this new EV battery breakthrough that
you could charge 500% faster even in
sub-zero weather. University of Michigan
engineers have it. And apparently, it's
working so well that it's already being
commercialized. So, we might see that.
Um, if if batterdriven cars didn't have
the cold weather problem and you could
also charge them 500%
faster, that's a big deal. Now, I will
tell you that I do see a battery
breakthrough story every single day, but
they all start sounding the same, so I
stopped reporting on all of them. But
the battery
stuff is really
interesting. is really interesting. All
right, here's uh on uh Andrew
Huberman's show, Huberman
Lab, he had an expert on who said that
if a mom has
diabetes, the risk of an autistic child
doubles. If the mom has obesity, the
risk of having an autistic child
doubles. And if the mom has diabetes and
obesity, which often go together, uh it
would quadruple the risk of the autistic
child. Now, I don't know if I'm fully
believing that yet because that would
fall into the somebody did a study, but
I don't know. But you first of all it
doesn't it doesn't match any of my
anecdotal
experience because every time I think of
somebody who had a um who had an
autistic kid I don't really think of
them as being overweight and so and I
don't know that they had diabetes so I
haven't really seen it. It's not like
something I've noticed or anything like
that. So, I'm a little skeptical of this
one, but um if it's true, it might be at
least part of the puzzle of why there's
so much of it lately. And it wouldn't
surprise me if diabetes and
obesity, you know, created a whole bunch
of, you know, health problems that you
didn't see coming. So, that part sort of
makes sense. But I don't know if I'm
quite buying
into that. It might be a big part of the
answer. I don't know. I'm a little
skeptical, but it could be that there
are multiple reasons and they're all
environmental andor health and uh it'll
be hard to untangle it.
Uh meanwhile, according to HR dive,
Emily Shamway is writing that uh the
judge says that IBM must face the
discrimination claim from the white male
worker who believes that he was uh fired
because he was white so that the bosses
could make room for uh their diversity
goals.
And here, let me just read this part.
The plaintiff alleged that IBM CEO set
specific percentage targets for the
racial and gender composition of IBM's
workforce. Now, I know that's true
because I've seen video of the CEO
saying exactly that. And then IBM
implemented a system of financial
incentives to reward executives who
worked to achieve those uh those
targets, the DEI targets
uh according to the lawsuit. Now, uh,
and the IBM CEO suggested that
executives who did not make progress on
getting that diversity they wanted could
be penalized or be fired or have their
pay
reduced. Now, this is the goal versus
system problem.
as a as a
goal. A little extra diversity might be
just positive as a
goal, but you have to develop a system
to make it happen. The system that he
developed, IBM CEO
guarantees that there would be massive
discrimination against white people.
Why? Follow the money. He he he created
a a massive financial interest in
discriminating against white people and
trying to make it look like it didn't
happen. So suddenly this guy who had
been getting good reviews suddenly puts
on a gets put on a performance, you
know, improvement plan, which is sort of
the last thing they do before they fire
you. So that they would have some
paperwork. Allegedly, they would have
some paperwork that would support the
firing the white guy because every time
you fired a white guy and replaced them
with a non-white guy, you would make
more
money. Or or to put it the other way,
the more successful you were
discriminating against your white
workforce, the less risk there would be
that you would get
fired, which is all about money, too.
So, how in the world does the CEO of IBM
not understand how money is an
incentive? And he didn't realize that
people would massively break the
law as soon as money was involved
because they could pretend they weren't
doing it. It wouldn't be hard to
pretend, right? Uh, I know. Uh, Carl was
doing a
inexplicably bad
job. Autism Capital is saying that
Mexican President Claudia Shinbomb says
she will not impose reciprocal tariffs
on the
US. I'll need to know more about that.
But today is going to be fascinating. So
if if the stock market turns green
today, and it might, it would be because
a few countries, it wouldn't take many,
decided to um play ball with Russia. I'm
sorry, play ball with
uh the tariff situation and just be
reasonable and come up with something
that that makes sense. So maybe that's
what Mexico is doing. Maybe that's what
Israel did. Although that there. They
didn't have much
tariffs. So, we'll keep an eye on that.
I I think there is a real good chance
that the stock market will end up in
positive territory by the end of the
day. Um, all it takes is a little bit
of a a little bit of a trend that
countries are looking to avoid the
economic war and make something work. It
wouldn't take much. maybe two or three
countries and stock market's going to
love it. So, we'll see. Oh, but I think
Trump's announcement will
be after the market
closes. Not
sure. Yeah. So, we'll see. All right.
So, IBM's going to figure that
out.
Um Elon Musk is getting a lot of
attention for saying he posted on X. As
I mentioned several years ago, it is
increasingly it increasingly appears
that humanity is a biological bootloader
for digital super
intelligence. Now, of course, he's 100%
right. It's just an analogy. It's not
like it's not like you have to buy into
the analogy. But, um here's what I
think. The reason that Elon Musk says we
need to be an interplanetary species is
that if you stayed on Earth, eventually
you would be destroyed by a meteor or
the sun burns down or something. So the
only way humans can survive is if
they're
interplanetary. And even that seems like
a risk
because, you know, I mean, Mars might
get destroyed before the United States
and before we find a third planet cuz
it's not like there's a bunch of other
planets. But suppose there was some kind
of uh gigantic risk to all life on
Earth. Would that risk be
equal to the AI?
Could you launch a rocket that just
takes the best AIs and puts them on
there and has a solar panels and and the
AI just lives forever as a digital
entity that's super intelligence.
So it could be that you need the
biological entities, we humans, for a
brief period of time just to get super
intelligence going, which could last
forever potentially could could last
through suns burning out and everything
else. Whereas the biological parts are
unlikely to survive as easily for, you
know, for millions of years. Anyway, I
think you're fine this week. I don't
know. I I agree with his statement, but
people are taking it wrong. They're
taking it as if he's saying that AI is
more important than human beings, which
is exactly the opposite of anything that
Elon Musk ever said or
believed. Wait, the stock market's
already
up? Is that true? Oh, I'll be damned.
The stock market's up
[Laughter]
already. Well, there you go.
There you
go. All right, everybody. That's all I
have for today. Thanks for joining on X
and Rumble and YouTube. I'm going to
talk to the
subscribers
on subscribers on locals next and
privately. The rest of you, we'll see
you tomorrow. Same time, same place.
