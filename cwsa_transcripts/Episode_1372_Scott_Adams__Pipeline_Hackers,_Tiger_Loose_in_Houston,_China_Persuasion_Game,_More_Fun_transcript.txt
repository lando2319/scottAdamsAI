well let me just say this if you're
wondering
scott do you only own maybe two t-shirts
and you wear them every day no i bought
a
pile of t-shirts many of them the same
colors so if you see me looking exactly
the same
well that's because i'm lazy and i just
buy piles of the same thing and then
just wear them
but that's not why you're here no that's
not why you're here
um you're here because you would like to
enjoy the simultaneous
sip with people all over the world
and all you need is a couple of mugler
glasses tanker shelves to sign a canteen
joke a flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
unparalleled i say
the dopamine hit of the day of the day i
say
it's called the simultaneous sep and i
know that people all over the world are
scurrying
scurrying like happy little chipmunks to
grab their
vessels to join me now and the
simultaneous sip go
oh you did that really well i think you
nailed it
good job everybody good job
happy birthday mark wilkinson and uh
the rest of you happy birthday to you i
don't know if you're it's your birthday
but i'm sure you have one this year
let's talk about all the stuff in my
favorite category of the left
eats itself michael che
he was getting some trouble for uh
cultural
misappropriation or
cultural appropriation so i guess
michael che who happens to be black
which is
important to this story is being accused
of writing a skit
in which somebody uses a there's a word
for it
black cultural lingo or whatever it is
now of course it was elon musk who was
speaking the words but it was actually
written by a black guy who's getting in
trouble for
writing things like a black guy
who would write something so uh when i
say like a black guy i mean he was
writing it from knowledge so
this reminds me of one of my favorite
scenes on youtube
with norm macdonald i've told you before
i
i got obsessed watching norm mcdonald
clips on youtube you could just line
them up and watch one after another
and there's something much funnier if
you watch all of this clips
because the thing that norm mcdonald
does
he tells individual jokes but there's
always a larger joke that's just above
the jokes
and if you don't see a lot of them you
don't get the larger context
that the individual a lot of them are
just dad jokes and stuff
but if you don't see that the real joke
is a is the layer above the joke
you're missing the whole show and one
one of the uh
clips that makes me laugh every time i
see it
is he was doing a weekend update when he
was doing that for saturday night live
however many years ago that was and he
does one of his
one of his jokes and it's like super uh
sexist and the you know the audience is
like whoa
i can't believe you said that it doesn't
matter what the joke is and then norm
says
ah well that joke was written by a woman
he goes now you don't know what the hell
to do dear
it's one of the greatest lines ever now
you don't know what the hell to do do
you
because as soon as you realize that it
wasn't him who wrote the joke it was a
woman who wrote the joke
your head goes ah okay now i don't know
what to think
uh it was a great moment in comedy
great britain is looking to pass some
kind of uh
law to cancel cancel culture
um so it's actually a war on wokeness
over there in great britain
so that the idea is that
people denied a platform by universities
will be able to sue them i guess in
court
so if a university says you're the wrong
kind of person because of your politics
or whatever and you're denied from the
university
should this become law i guess you can
do something about it
now i always tell you that the slippery
slope
doesn't slip forever there's usually a
counter force that pops up and this
would be
an example so the example of uh
uh michael che being uh almost canceled
for being for just being himself
basically
uh and then you know that that shows you
how ridiculous
the walkness thing has gotten then you
see the uh
great britain literally passing a law
against it like it's a crime
like wokeness has achieved the level
of criminal behavior just think about
that
wokeness the discrimination against
people for
what they say or think will have reached
criminal proportions if great britain
passes this law
think about that the criminal
proportions
uh somebody says it is criminal i
suppose in some ways it is
here's a vaccination update to 46 of the
u.s
population has received at least one
dose
now that's way better than it sounds
because the 46 percent who got the one
dose does not include children
right so this is a completely misleading
statistic
what this should say is that um
what percentage of people over let's say
70
got the vaccination because it's way up
there right the number of people over 70
because that's basically the whole story
right if you get all the over 70s
vaccinated
your rate of death goes down 95
can somebody help me on that number it'd
be in that range right
90 at least
so i think seeing 46 percent of the
total population is a completely
misleading number
and 32 have been fully vaccinated again
that's
going to be the older people i asked
this question
on twitter in a highly unscientific poll
i said
how do you feel after the first
vaccination
now in some cases you only need one but
i wondered how people felt just
psychologically
not physically but psychologically do
you feel
better after getting the first shot
or do you feel scared
well i did get my first shot last week
and the reason i asked is because i feel
better
meaning that my my mental
feeling when i'm just around people has
improved
and i would say substantially actually
so if you're
if you're trying to decide whether
getting the vaccination will make you
feel better or feel worse like more
scared or less scared
the people who took it said that about a
quarter of them
i'm gonna round off here quite a bit but
about a quarter of them said they
they're more afraid after getting the
vaccination
i don't know do you think you'd be one
of those people more afraid after you
got a vaccination
about a quarter of the people are more
relieved i'm
closer to 30 i'm in that category i'm
relieved and about half the people say
no different which you'd expect
so if you're wondering should i get the
vaccination
i would look at this quarter of the
people feel better
i think you know which category you'd be
in
now this brings us to an important risk
management question
now let's see if you can get this one
right
how do you how do you incorporate the
risk
of something completely unknown such as
long-term vaccination side effects
if you if you don't want to get the
vaccination it's because you're
afraid of the long-term effects i don't
think
that anybody looks at the short-term
risk
and thinks that that's greater than the
risk of the virus itself
because you all know that right if
you're not dying in the first 10
minutes or first two weeks if it doesn't
get you in the first two weeks
and even that's a safer risk than not
getting the vaccination according to
what we know
if it doesn't get you right away what
are the odds that's going to get you in
the long term
and how do you calculate the risk reward
well i just
interacted with somebody on twitter who
felt that the
unknown was big enough to not get the
vaccination
how do you know how big the unknown is
i'm going to be looking at your answers
as they go by
because this is a tough one if you talk
to the best
risk management person in the world
or several of them would they even
approach this the same way
and i actually don't know the answer to
that but i'll tell you how
i approach it okay now again
i think people can approach this
differently i'll just give you my
risk management approach and remember
none of this is to suggest that you
should do or not do anything
right so this is not about you this is
about you
learning some risk management technique
what you do with it is all you okay
there's no persuasion about
vaccinations happening here if it feels
like it
turn that off you get to make your own
decision
no exceptions all right
here's how i do it there is a category
of
unknowns that are completely unknown
and then there's a category of unknowns
that fit into
let's say a um a category another
category
which you can say something about the
category but you can't know
anything about the things in it
specifically let me be
more clear than that because that wasn't
very good
we do know from experts about
the general risk of vaccinations
generally speaking
in the long run because there have been
lots of different vaccinations and lots
of experts
what the experts say is that the
long-term risk
is trivial now could they be wrong
and if they were wrong could you die
yeah yeah they could be wrong
and you could die or get a terrible
health problem
but what are the odds of that let me
tell you what else could happen
in houston there's a tiger that's
running free
literally a guy who had his own pet
tiger got arrested
and the tiger is out wandering the
streets
now that tiger could come upon somebody
who's on their way to get a vaccination
and the tiger could kill somebody who
was going to get a vaccination
because they were left the house to do
it whereas if they had never left the
house
the tiger could never even find them and
kill them
so when you're if you're in houston and
you're trying to decide whether to get a
vaccination today
should you include in your risk
management
the odds of the tiger getting you
because you left the house
in the comments tell me should you
consider it
because if the tiger kills you you're
dead
i mean you're just dead that's the
ultimate risk
so should you include the tiger risk
when you decide to get your vaccinations
why not i'm seeing people say no
it's a real risk if you're in houston
you don't know where the tiger is it's
unknown
it's an unknown risk that could kill you
and it's real it's not imaginary
it's a real tiger i didn't make that up
by the way it's a real tiger
today there's an actual tiger loose in
houston
it's real right so i'm looking at
your answers it's it's it's a tough one
isn't it
because the risk of getting killed by
that tiger
if you go outdoors in houston today
is probably higher than the risk of
having a side effect from
the vaccination but we don't know
don't know right so here's my general
advice
on risk management if a risk
is so unknown but also
experts say is not the kind that you
necessarily need to worry about
don't include it in your calculation so
i would say don't include the tiger
don't include the risk of driving
because you can die in your car right
so that's a risk if you've got to get
the vaccination don't include the risk
of let's say
if you went to a medical facility there
often you can get an infection just by
being in a hospital
i wouldn't count it because it's so
small what are the odds that you would
be hit by
the rocket debris from a chinese
rocket that's coming back into earth's
atmosphere
i wouldn't count it it's a real risk
there is
actual debris there are actual meteors
that fall to earth
and could kill you but i wouldn't count
it
because all of that all the stuff that's
so remote
i just rounded to zero so here's my
advice
if the experts tell you that a type of
risk
is in the category of things that the
experts say
is so small you could ignore it for this
particular decision
probably ignore it just like you would
ignore the tiger just like you ignore
the car ride risks just like you ignore
space debris following on your head
anything could happen but they're so
small
that you should ignore them somebody
says you're underestimating the
probability
keep in mind that the probability cannot
be estimated
what are the what are your personal odds
of being killed by the tiger in houston
not the same as anybody else's even if
you could estimate the odds
of everybody you know all people being
killed by the tiger
you can't estimate your odds because
that tiger could be sitting on your
doorstep
you might be the only the only one who's
close to the tiger
while it's hungry right so any any
general risk
doesn't apply to you your risk is you
so it's a complete unknown but i would
say if the experts were warning you that
it was a problem
then i would take it seriously if the
experts say it's in the class of things
you don't need to worry about
after the first two weeks because that's
when side effects tend to
represent themselves
i would say all of those risks i would
discount to zero but
if you can find a risk management expert
who disagrees with me or you could find
a better way to calculate the risks
then i would say do it but that's where
i am
on those the things that can't be
calculated did i see a headline that
said that the california budget
had a surplus of at 75 billion
i feel like i hallucinated that because
i saw that headline and then i didn't
see any news reports on it
is that real california budget had a 75
billion dollars
extra that really happened
now is that just because they got
federal money
because the other thing that's true is
apparently we're we're going to run out
of electricity like we always do
and also uh the the forests are going to
catch on fire again
because we haven't cleaned out the
underbrush and apparently it's the
driest and worst it's ever been
so any moment now the whole state's
going to go up in smoke
just like last year last year you
couldn't even go outdoors for months
couldn't go outdoors you couldn't go
outdoors
for months in california last year and
this year is supposed to be worse
and he's thinking about using this for i
don't know extra
stimulus checks or something i'm
thinking to myself
i feel like we should throw a few
billion
at hiring all the unemployed people to
go clear the underbrush
because are you telling me are you
telling me
that we don't need to do it or that we
can't find bodies
we have the money you have hordes of
unemployed people
allegedly and you have all this money
and you have exactly the task that is
most important for them to do
clearing the underbrush i feel like this
is quite an opportunity here but i guess
he's just going to issue checks because
that would be politically
expedient
let's see the ap is reporting that china
has opened up a new front
for persuasion i guess they got lots of
twitter fake accounts
twitter is fighting hard to identify and
get rid of them but
you know they just sign up more so there
are tens of thousands of these
fake accounts and hundreds of thousands
of tweets and retweets and stuff
and um
i guess it was inevitable i mean why
would china
not do this there's no reason in the
world for them to not do this
they should do this it's just obvious
thing to do
so we should expect more of that so
in my favorite uh favorite category of
news
there's a whole bunch of stuff happening
in the uh how to build a cheap
house category now when i say cheap i
don't mean
crappy i mean cheap as in it did not
cost you many dollars
but you got an awesome house if you've
ever looked at how homes are built
you would know that the inefficiency in
the system from beginning to end
is extraordinary like the entire
approval housing codes all the way
through
you know the final the final
construction
everything about that industry is
completely inefficient and wrong
i mean you're using materials have been
shipped from the other side of the earth
everything's you know cut to uh specific
models
there's no such thing as engineering you
know a well-designed home that everybody
could live in
i mean the whole thing's a complete mess
because of the dynamics of the
marketplace and
what people can sell and what what the
buyers know
et cetera a simple example
is that it would be easy for a builder
to build a closet exactly where you need
it
but the buyer of the house doesn't know
that the closet isn't there
because they don't really notice they
look at the house and it's beautiful and
they say oh it's in the right location
schools are good they buy it so houses
are not designed for the way you live
they're designed that when you stand in
it and look around you go whoa this
looks cool
i want to live here that's it
so there's not even any attempt
to make a well-designed home
think about that that's a big statement
isn't it every one of us lives and you
know
not every one of us unfortunately most
of us live in some kind of a home
being an apartment or a house nobody
as far as i know nobody in
that part of the industry is putting any
attention
into designing a home the way you'd want
to live in it
do you believe that if you don't believe
it just tour any home
and stand there and say does this work
for the way anybody lives
not even close right just ask yourself
what you do all day
and then look at the home and say if it
matches
it won't even be close
here's a small example how many of you
own pets
most of you right probably at least
two-thirds of you own a pet
was your home designed with a pet door
no was your home designed with a place
that's obvious where the
the dog's food would be or the cat's cat
box
no two-thirds of people have
pets zero homes are designed
with a pet in mind right
now i've seen a few like i've seen like
a model home with a
dog a dog shower in it but they're not
even
they're not even trying to design these
things
the way a modern person lives um in my
house
i designed this house 12 years ago and
it's got a tv in almost every room
tv in almost every room i think i have
14 televisions how many televisions
do all of us who live here watch in any
given day
none none people don't watch television
anymore
we watch it on our devices so if i'm
going to watch something in the house
i've got headphones in and i'm watching
it on my phone or my ipad
it used to be that i wanted the big
screen because you know cgi
and action movies but since action
movies all look alike
i usually fast forward during the action
scenes
am i the only one who does that when i
watch an action movie
like a superhero movie and it gets to
the fight scene
i just fast forward through the fight
scene because it's just this
i don't need to watch that things are
moving
and hero gets hit and then hits back
there's nothing there
the other thing that i fast forward
through is any kind of a
love scene in the beginning of in the
beginning of a movie
where they're trying to show that these
two actors are really two people
very much in love and they do the
sickeningly sweet thing
so that you can understand they're
really in love because one of them is
going to die pretty soon
fast forward okay we've got 10 minutes
of them
acting sickeningly sweet to each other
that i don't want to see
all for the purpose of telling me that
these two people really like
each other and the reason for that is so
that one of them dies
i as the viewer will feel bad
why am i going to watch that fast
forward i
got it next scene uh
somebody's tied to a chair and they're
going to be tortured i got it they're
tough
they can get through it fast forward
torture is over
uh car chase scene going to be a car
that's going really fast and almost have
an accident
fast forward car chase scene and why
would you need a big screen to watch
anything
there's no reason for a big screen the
the hollywood industry
um
i don't know how to deal with that
comment about tobacco yet but i saw it
uh so anyway homes are not designed for
the way we live and if they were we
could do them cheaply
there are three examples that are new
one of them
is a 3d printed dirt home in italy
so in 200 hours they can dig up the dirt
and here's the important part
they use the dirt that's already there
so they dig it up they sift it they mix
it with corn husks
turn it into a 3d printer and 200 hours
later
they build really cool looking houses
you know they look like
pods and stuff they're really cool
looking but
um while they do solve the problem
of material shipping because they're
using materials from the dirt that's
there
well what it doesn't do is give you a
way to
modify it later have you ever lived in a
house that you didn't need to modify a
lot
in the comments how many of you live in
a house
where you're not continuously running
another cable
adding an outlet
changing a wall so i don't think these
3d homes are the future
or at least not the whole future because
i think you need homes that can be
customized as you go right if you can't
change the wiring and stuff
and where do you put the wiring in a 3d
printed home
like how would you open up a wall
could you do it i don't know so here's
another
model there's a tiny home built with uh
some kind of a cheap panel
darn it i wish i'd written that down uh
but and the third kind
is a company in uh
is it denmark or someplace called gab
block
g-a-b-l-o-k and they literally make
a blocks so insulated
wooden blocks that you can pick up and
just put on a wall by yourself
almost there you think that you need to
get to the point where people can build
their own home
literally just by putting blocks
together to form the home
because then you can take it apart and
reconfigure things rebuild a home etc
but there's one more thing that needs to
be done to make this work
we need to have a set of common designs
for best rooms best room design
there definitely is three best bedroom
designs
don't you think i mean there's not that
much variation in what a bedroom needs
to be
bed stay in bed some place to put your
clothes a window to look out
right so you could design a perfectly
perfectly designed areas so that nothing
needs to be cut
so you want your floor plan and your
your walls
to be exactly you know one foot um
units so you don't have to like cut
something in half to make it
nothing needs to be cut so we're getting
there
cheap housing is the future uh
israel and gaza are at it i guess the
gaza militants are launching
rockets into israel and the iron dome is
doing a good job they say do you believe
that
do you believe the iron dome is working
now the iron dome is israel's rocket
defense
system that shoots rockets up to shoot
down the incoming rockets
and there's a video of it working i do
remember
that however many years ago was there
was a video of the
same thing where it was showing the
israel was just
knocking down all these rockets but
later we found out it was all bs
fake news and that the number of rockets
that that actually hit
wasn't all of them all right so it
wasn't as good maybe it's better now
maybe they have more more defense but
we're
seeing again the you know the iron dome
at work
and i don't know that it's as effective
as
they would like us to believe but it's
definitely better than not having one
and the question has to be asked would
any of this be happening if
trump were still in office do we believe
that the current increase in tensions
over there
are because it was just going to happen
anyway
you know is it just events on the ground
or
is it opportunistic stuff because biden
isn't president is it opportunistic what
do you think
yeah i feel as if um trump would have
been
somewhat of a control on this but it's
hard to know
let's talk about that matt gates story
that continues to be nothing
now i'm not going to say that it could
never turn into
nothing or that it could never turn into
something
but every day that goes by it's more
interesting that we don't have an
accuser
or at least one that has a name all
right
so this entire thing about matt gates
cnn keeps trying to make a story about
it but they don't have anything that's
like evidence or a witness or
a victim so it's a crime story
with no evidence no victim
that's been named but a lot of looking
for it
and so the latest is that there are two
people who might
turn what's it called state's evidence
or whatever
would become informants one of them is
the one we already knew
this joel greenberg guy so that part is
not news
because we've known that for a while but
the cnn needs to make this news
so they're going to throw in that fact
that we already knew and then they're
throwing in the new fact
which might not be a fact which is that
allegedly maybe
sort of there's some ex-girlfriend of
matt gates
who might want to talk to authorities
the ex-girlfriend is not making any
accusations
she's not the victim she's not the
subject of the
potentially 17 year old girl
she's just the girlfriend who might know
something so keep in mind
matt gates a sitting congress person
has been accused of really serious
crimes
and now weeks later the best story they
can come up with
is they might want to talk to some
people who might know some things
that they don't know are you
kidding me and and we're we're okay with
this
like we're watching this happen right in
front of us
if you can't come up with a better story
of something he did
such as an actual crime
an actual allegation with specifics
a person involved a victim if you don't
have
any of that i don't know that it's a
story yet
again it's not my job to apologize for
anybody
or defend anybody
because i think you and i can say with
certainty that we
don't know what matt gates did or did
not do right so we don't know
um but i'm just gonna go out and say it
that if if matt gates is guilty of
everything he's accused of none of it
looks important to me
is anybody on the same page with that if
he's guilty of everything
accused of and again there's no evidence
that the public is aware of
just no evidence that we're aware of
um if he's guilty of every bit of that
none of it's important
i mean none of it even rises to the
level of who cares
and i know that i'm not supposed to say
that right
shouldn't i get canceled for saying that
i'm supposed to
you know be fretting about the the poor
victim and everything
but there weren't any this this story
doesn't even have a victim
even if everything that's alleged
happened
no victim except mac aids
matt gates looks like a victim here but
no other one
otherwise it's people doing what they
wanted to do
and maybe one person lied about their
age
and and wasn't a wasn't a victim
if it's true that a 17 year old lied a
better age and that's
you know maybe the worst thing that
happened who's the victim
the 17 year old apparently not
matt gates looks like it looks like he's
the victim
if somebody lies about their age it's
the guy who's the victim
because he wasn't doing the lying right
so the more this story emerges the more
it looks like matt gates
is the victim of the story in a
practical sense
in the legal sense of course there are
laws about
these things which you could argue maybe
there shouldn't be
but they do exist so let's talk about
that
pipeline hack
are you as confused as i am about why
they can't just erase all their software
and back it
and and use the backup software and go
back in action
what kind of a company that owns runs a
major
infrastructure asset
can't back up their software there's
something about the story i don't
understand
right now somebody said scott scott
scott you've been out of the business
world too long big companies don't back
up all their software
to which i say oh i get that you know i
wouldn't be surprised if
big companies didn't back up all of
their software
but if you're a pipeline if you're a
pipeline
i do sort of expect you to have all your
software backed up
if you're a nuclear energy plant
i kind of expect maybe that's just me
but i would kind of expect you to have a
little bit of a backup plan
for your data so there's something about
the story that doesn't make sense
either there's massive incompetence at
the company
for having something within a backup or
maybe there's some reason it's not
backed up that i'm not aware of
so that's that's a big question mark but
here are my other
comments on this however have i ever
told you
i tell you this every day literally
every day i tell you that the difference
between democrats and republicans
is that democrats do not factor in human
motivation
when they make decisions i know it's
weird
whereas the republicans start with human
motivation
and then build the system around it and
then it always works
but if you act like human motivation
isn't even a variable
nothing's going to work this is another
perfect example
imagine a president trump being
president right now
when the pipeline got hacked here's what
a good
negotiator would say release
release the encrypted stuff right now
um we're already tracking you down and
we will kill you
we will kill you where you stand really
soon
and you don't know whether we know where
you are or not so you're gonna have to
guess
but if you haven't released this in 24
hours you might be dead
now what would be the human motivation
of hackers
who could not be entirely sure if the
military of the united states
already has a laser sight on their roof
because they don't know right the
hackers
think they're they have a way to be
completely safe or they wouldn't do it
but they don't know and if trump were
president
do you think he would let them know that
we don't know where where they are
because we're kind to doing that by the
fact that we're dealing with it the way
we're doing it
i don't feel like the hackers feel like
they're in immediate danger
i think trump would tell them they might
be dead in 24 hours
that's what i would do because human
motivation is
they're not going to do anything
differently unless they're afraid
so why the hell would you negotiate with
these hackers
without putting them at the threat of
immediate death
that's how you negotiate right you don't
negotiate on a weakness
you tell them look here's the deal
hackers because apparently we're in
communication with them or somebody is
there must be some kind of communication
right you tell them here's the deal
how about you just release the data we
give you nothing
and you don't have to guess whether
you'll be dead by the end of today
i know that might that might make them a
little more flexible
or at least lower the price
[Laughter]
but if we're not negotiating from a
point of them fearing their death
that day like literally that day you
might be dead by the end of today
we're not doing it right and i know that
trump would have gotten that right
because he he goes for the threat first
all right um somebody asked on twitter
uh how is it possible that a pipeline
can get hacked you would think it would
have the highest level of cyber security
and still got hacked um
but why is it that that could get hacked
but our election system
is totally um safe
do you have a does that feel right
that even something as important as a
pipeline can get hacked
but the election can't now
that comment sounds clever until i point
out
that the hackers who hacked the pipeline
got caught
meaning that they weren't trying to do
anything secret
you can't really blackmail unless you
tell people you did it
so if the election system had been
hacked
the proper comparison would be would we
notice
so that the the pipeline was not hacked
without notice
it was hacked with notice so you can't
really compare that to
something that presumably would have
been hacked in
in a secret way if anybody could have
figured out a way to do it
but i think the the general concept is
correct
which is that anything can get hacked so
let me say this as clearly as i can if
you say
you know that the election software was
hacked
you don't know that you don't know that
there's no evidence of that all right
actually there is a story in um
in some non-major media there is some
story about the arizona audit that i'm
not going to repeat
because it is not yet from a what i
would call a credible source
but um anyway the point is anything can
get hacked
if you think that the election system
wasn't was hacked
there's no evidence that but if you
think it definitely
wasn't hacked you're stupid
sorry i had to drop the f-bomb on you
there
because sometimes stupid doesn't tell
the story
right sometimes you're you're f and
stupid
if you know the system was hacked
show us the information i haven't seen
any but if you know it wasn't you're
just a idiot
all right there's nothing else you can
say about that
if you if you're positive it wasn't
hacked that's just idiot
because you can't be positive of that
you could be right
by the way if you say it wasn't hacked
you could be right
because how would i know the the
accusation would be it was
act without the public knowing that's
the very thing
but if you're positive because cnn told
you that it wasn't
and then you're like oh cnn says it
wasn't hacked so i guess it's all good
if you're positive it wasn't hacked
you're stupid
you can't know that it's unknowable
all right uh i just have to dump on
melinda gates a little bit more
there's a quote that's just bugging the
hell enemy
when she took her job at the the gates
foundation she had this quote
she said bill and i are equal partners
melinda told the associated press
men and women should be equal at work
god i hate her i just hate melinda gates
i have to say
this quote just makes me hate her guts i
really do
i just freaking hate her because
while i agree with the sentiment of
course men and women should be equal at
work
in the sense of equal opportunity men
and women should be equal at work
in the sense of um you know equal
safety equal pay
we all agree with that right
but melinda is not bill gates
bill gates built microsoft and became
the richest guy in the world at least
for a while melinda
had sex with bill gates now i'm not
going to say that's easy either
but it's not the same you're not equal
let me say this as clear as i can bill
gates one of the smartest people on
earth who did one of the most amazing
commercial successes of all time that's
who bill gates is
melinda you are somebody who sucked his
dick
you're not equal you're not equal
and it has nothing to do with gender if
bill gates
had been gay and married a man
he would still be marrying a man who
only sucked his dick
that man did not start microsoft
that man did not start the gates
foundation
that man hypothetically didn't do
anything
except suck his dick you're not equal
you're not equal stop saying it
it's an insult to men
this is just an insult
so melinda i'm glad bill gates is
divorcing your ass
although maybe melinda is the one who
started it i don't know
all right that
[Laughter]
was scott ever on epstein's island no i
wasn't
but if you'd like to start any good
rumors i'm always up for a good rumor
now if i haven't told you this before uh
if
you ever hear any great sex rumors about
me
i doubt she will i doubt you will but if
you ever did
i would encourage you to believe all of
them except anything that's illegal
right so if you hear any rumors about me
that i did anything illegal
didn't happen but if you're any rumor
that's
interesting that's like really
interesting
and it's like sex is involved i would
encourage you to believe it
it won't be true it's very unlikely
it'll be true
but i would encourage you to believe it
because it makes me more interesting
yeah gerbil if you hear anything about a
gerbil totally
i i totally uh stuck that gerbil in
there
all right so that is all i have for you
today
um i think that you are noticing that i
don't know if it's just
because we don't have a president trump
but
the news has really started to become
sort of a golden age
kind of a news situation which is that
there doesn't seem to be a lot of
terrible stuff happening
and the things that were already
terrible seem to be getting better at a
pretty good rate
this is a weird time you know anything
could happen in the next few weeks
but we're definitely entering the best
time in
human history and if you're not seeing
it you're missing a great show
because i don't think any humans have
ever been in a better situation
than we're about to be in we're not
quite there all right
we got a lot of work to do but we're
right on the cusp
of a golden age that will be phenomenal
alright that's all for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow
