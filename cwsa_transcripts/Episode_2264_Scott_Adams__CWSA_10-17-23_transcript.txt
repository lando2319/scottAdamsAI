good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization it's the best thing you
could ever be doing and man just think
of all the other things you could be
doing they're all worse all worse but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody could even ever
imagine all you need is a cuper mug or a
glass a tanker chel or Dy and a canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee en jooin me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dop me h of the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous siping
happens now
go that's some good
stuff well let's uh mix things up a
little bit today you're you ready for
some trouble anybody want some
trouble I got some I'm going to bring it
to you right now but first these lesser
important stories to get you all warmed
up I need to fluff you a little bit
before we get to the good stuff so
apparently Ikea is going to make a
car that comes flat packed so somehow
they figured out to make a tiny little
electric car you know not a Tesla but
you know even more like a golf
cart and would cost less than $111,000
and it would be flat packed and shipped
to somebody who would assemble it for
you do you think you would drive
a uh a car at 55 miles per hour that
could be flat
packed I feel like if you hit something
at 55 miles an
hour there wouldn't be much left of
you but suppose if you
will uh that all of the traffic was by
requirement
self-driving well then it wouldn't
matter too much what your car look like
because it would never it would never
hit anything else it would know where
everything else was and avoid
it but uh I like the fact that I keep
trying this I don't know if it'll
work wouldn't say that I want one but I
like that they're trying
it well Trump is still pushing his uh
Freedom cities which I think is just one
of the best ideas any president ever had
am I all alone about this his idea is to
use government land to uh bid it out to
developers who want to build a city from
scratch the idea is to make it a better
city than a normal City because you'd
design it right from the start but also
that it would be affordable that
Ordinary People could afford to live
there that's totally doable if you
started from scratch with the idea of
building a city that was better to live
in than any City Plus way way cheaper
you could do that you could totally do
that yeah there's nothing that would
stop you from doing that so I like that
idea I like it creates jobs I like that
it might make housing more affordable
for a lot of people it would spur
Innovation it would spur optimism it
become a model for other
cities I tell you when whenever real
estate is involved Trump excels am I
right wherever real estate is involved
he's always really
good and this Freedom City stuff is just
perfect this is an idea that just
couldn't be any better it's just a
perfect idea it's like his perfect phone
call but think of the other things he
does that are real estate
related no new Wars
were started during Trump's
Administration no new Wars what are Wars
wars are always real State like the the
reason given you know such as Hamas
might be more about just killing people
they want to kill but at the at the
Bottom of Everything Is Real
Estate so he not only ends War by
effectively being good at real estate I
guess uh but he could build these
Freedom cities and I know he's really
good on real estate
he he also used the same plan to make
peace with North Korea you remember when
he was talking to Kim Jong well actually
before he visited him the first time uh
his administration created a video of
how they could develop North
Korea and they could you know build
these nice buildings there and maybe
even maybe even American Investment Etc
so he used a real estate argument to
make peace with North Korea
he just sees real estate wherever he
goes that apparently it works anyway
um I love the freedom cities so
president she met with Putin Putin
traveled to China and I took a careful
note um you can you can stop doing the
reframe I saw it
um I took careful note of the body
language
have you ever noticed that when people
meet president she he looks like he
doesn't want to be there and he has he
has
heartburn is is usually his eyes are
kind of closed and he's got the
heartburn face and he's he just sort of
wishes he weren't there sort of thing
just sort of wish I was somewhere else
but when uh Putin showed up I looked at
his body language it was completely
inclusive
he looked like he actually
enjoys his company like he did not look
like it was a estate V they look like
buddies now Putin didn't he seemed more
nervous because he was in a he wasn't on
his home court so he seemed a little
more formal but she looked like hey my
best friend just came to visit it
honestly looked like his college
roommate came to see him or something so
if you're worried about that Association
maybe that's a little more worrying all
right here's a story that I don't
believe yet I guess this was in The
Daily
Mail and you've seen this story
before but the fact that it's again in
the news doesn't make me believe it more
and the idea is that the biggest cartel
has banned their own organization from
selling
fenel now they also have said that they
were never in the fenel business to
begin
with so that so this the cartel this is
El Chapo's cartel caloa have said two
things one we've never been in that
fenal business whatsoever in any way two
we're totally getting out of the fentel
business and it will kill you if you try
to sell any and then there are stories
that they actually killed some of their
own people who tried to sell
fental I don't know if I believe any of
that do you does that sound like a real
story like whatever is real is probably
three layers below this you know that
there might be some kind of weird
agreement to you know go easy on one
cartel if they help us take down the
other
cartels you know I've often thought if I
were in charge I would get the head of
one of the cartels El Chapo and I'd make
a deal say look we're just going to keep
crushing just your cartel nobody else's
we're going to put all of our attention
just crushing your
cartel
unless unless you'd like to flip get out
of the get out of the fenal business
completely and then help us take down
the other
cartels maybe I mean it might be the
best you can do because you you probably
can't get them totally out of business
that seems unlikely but you can maybe
cut it down to just cating cocaine and
weed and meth then it's not as bad as
fentel so maybe something like that's
happened we have no visibility on it
whatsoever well Starbucks in San
Francisco is closing seven
stores uh the company declined to
provide comment as to whether it was
crime
related uh let me let me see if I can
piece this
together a San Francisco
Starbucks closed what would be all the
possible reasons for that well one would
be
unprofitable do you believe there's ever
been an unprofitable Starbucks in San
Francisco do you think that's happened
even once in the history of
Starbucks somebody says yes
maybe unprofitable well unprofitable
because of crime maybe but not
unprofitable because people don't want
to buy uh expensive coffee in San
Francisco that's not a thing so
San Francisco continues its decline
toward an agrarian
situation um have you seen all the video
changing the topic now going from
one hellscape to another we'll go from
San Francisco to Gaza have you seen all
the video of the uh the Gaza
attacks the the new ones I'm talking
about the ones in the last 24 hours have
you seen them
nope no you haven't you haven't seen any
attacks no you've seen old ones you
might have seen a still picture that was
taken who knows when but nope you are
not going to see any video of whatever
is happening in Gaza now you knew that
was coming right not just because it's
War but because it's a war in which the
hearts and minds are such a big part of
the story so yeah you're not going to
you're not going to see anything you
might see some stuff snuck out and then
you're going to wonder if it's
real uh somebody very nicely sent me an
X this morning probably the most
disturbing image I've ever seen in my
life like scarred for life kind of image
now I wish they hadn't but I looked at
it and I said to myself how do I know
that came out of
Gaza how would I know it was just just a
a picture of the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life but I don't
know where it came from so yeah I
blocked the person who said
it anyway uh let's talk about Biden's
boxes this seems like the least
important story in the world doesn't it
you we're watching the world explode in
the Middle East and Ukraine and all that
but uh it turns out do you remember the
narrative that we were told about Biden
boxes so you had the Trump boxes which
were oh big problem you I'm talking
about the mar Lago boxes that had uh
secret stuff in it oh those were some
bad boxes we're not sure but probably
nuclear submarine stuff you know maybe
space laser stuff I mean he had the good
secrets and and I'll tell you not only
did he have the really dangerous Secrets
but he was showing them to people who
visited oh look that bad stuff he was
doing and uh and he was trying to hide
from the prosecutors like moving it
around and lying and trying to keep
stuff oh he did everything wrong oh my
God now if you compare that to the
moment the moment that Biden found out
he had some boxes in his garage that
didn't belong there turned it in
reported it
cooperated and and just the contrast was
so huge you know one probably some kind
of criminal trying to get away with
stuff the other innocent mistake an
innocent mistake quickly corrected and
probably nothing in those boxes to worry
about
anyway well enter Jonathan
turly to inform us that it turns out
there might be a little bit of question
on that Biden box timeline
situation it might be that on a number
of occasions they've been relocated it
might be that a lot of them were in one
place and then they were doled out to
different locations such as the Pen
Center and different houses which would
suggest a long knowledge that they
existed and decision-making about which
parts went
where over a long period of
time that's right there's a little more
to the story Jonathan Turley can tell
you just Google him and Biden's boxes
and it'll pop right up but it was all
 the whole oh oh we didn't know
we had some boxes I guess we better turn
these in right away oh and by the way
have you heard this speculation about
the secrets that are in Biden's
boxes because I've Heard lots of
speculation about what was in Trump's
boxes why no speculation about Biden's
boxes they be nuclear
secrets what about all the nuclear
secrets are they only in Trump
boxes nothing is true the the news is
just completely made up it's just all
 top to
bottom Biden's boxes all
right uh Bill M I think it was on Friday
on his show was talking about the the
word
colonizer he was talking about how the
uh the Hamas is calling the uh residents
of Israel
colonizers but and I think he was quite
cognizant of the fact that if you're
calling somebody a colonizer you're kind
of marking them for bad treatment like
nobody likes a
colonizer uh although he was making the
point which is that the Hamas would
think that Jews anywhere in the world
are
colonizers so there does seem to be a
question about how much of the
Palestinian Israel situation is about
real estate because there are smart
people who say no no Scott it's not
about real estate you have to understand
that one group wants the other group
dead but would they want them dead if
there never been a dispute about real
estate in other words are the Wagers you
know also that they want to kill the
Vietnamese who've never left
Vietnam are they colonizers
does SAS say oh you know all those uh
Sri Lankans we got to get them next
those
colonizers I don't think so so I don't
think you can separate real estate from
the hatred you know I think it's all one
big ball so to say it's either just hate
or it's just real
estate both wrong is some kind of weird
mix of those two things and other things
too but I would like to point out as
many times as I need to that if you're
in America and some American is calling
you a colonizer that
person it's a Prelude to
violence um have I ever told you that
thought turn into words words turn into
action I didn't make that up that's a
old saying um so if people have already
turned their thoughts into this word
colonizer colonizer suggests a specific
specific set of future actions right
it's not a general word that hey
Anything could happen once you said
colonizer is your point of view that
does narrow what you imagine are the
acceptable ways to go forward and I
wouldn't want to be around anybody like
that so get some distance between
yourself and any people who are talking
those terms and use words like colonizer
which is the CW for white people like
it's the N word for white people
basically with a C
um here's here's a story that's just
blowing my mind like if I didn't know
the people involved I would say this was
fake news right but this is Candace
Owens I consider her High credibility
she's telling about her own experience
right so it's unlikely this is wrong ju
so just hold in your head that this is a
real thing that happened in the real
world I'll just read it this is Candace
Owens two years ago I enrolled in an
online course at UCLA law I kid you not
when I say my final exam essay was to
argue against project Veritas by
representing the arguments of the New
York Times in their ongoing defamation
case for weekly extra credit in this
class we were encouraged to show proof
of attending various social justice
events imagine attending a protest for
extra
credit uh and says I declined to attend
these events but I am sharing this
experience now to underscore just how
severe the indoctrination has become I
had no idea like as bad as you think it
might be you don't really realize it's
going to this level I mean I just really
I had no idea
um so professors are literally offering
to improve your grade if you attend to
protest or get involved in a variety of
their left leaning causes now that
doesn't quite seem like education does
it that that just feels like pure
indoctrination it's just propaganda and
and
programming um and it gets
worse in the same class the assigned
textbook stated that Donald Trump gassed
protesters on his way to visit the
church during the BLM
riots that's one of the most famous
debunked hoaxes it's it's in a textbook
yeah have you heard me say a whole bunch
of times how would anybody write the
history of the last seven
years how would you do it because there
are two completely different
histories if if you've lived through the
last seven years you know that there are
two histories and they don't match so if
you're going to write a history book
there's no way in the world you can
combine them because they they're just
totally
incompatible and there's no way you can
pick one of them because one of them's
going to be and the other one
who knows maybe that one's too
but we have this entirely fake history
so we can guarantee not just wonder but
you can guarantee that the time you live
through your own life will be recorded
as fake history in other words it'll be
a fake version that doesn't match what
you actually live through and that will
be taught to the kids and the grandkids
and that's a done deal I'm not saying
that we must worry about this happening
I'm saying it's done history's been
erased and replaced by
 probably always has
been probably always has
been all
right uh Mike cerovich gives a warning
that scared the out of
me so I'm going to scare this out
of you by just quing okay soich posted
this today uh it was in response to
Candace's thing that I just read he said
yep these are going to be law clerks for
federal judges we won't have a
functioning legal system within 10 years
maybe five I've told every conservative
I know to make sure their kids have been
taken care of financially and be
prepared to face false
charges he is completely
right the way things are heading and I
don't see anything that's going to
change it right
away conservatives will just be arrested
for madeup charges because all it takes
is that there' be enough people of a
particular point of view to be in the
right jobs and there's nobody to
overturn it so if you got the
da well you're okay if the judge is on
your side you know the judge is not too
woke that might correct it but what if
the da and the local politicians and
theud
Judes are all the same point of view how
can you possibly have anything like
justice you wouldn't expect it so CER
ofici you saying it could get to the
point where um people are essentially
haunted for with lawfare now that is my
biggest concern at the moment that I'll
be charged with something
fake and I don't think there's a defense
against it in today's world I believe if
you get charged in the right place and I
live in a place where I've got a Soros
prosecutor in my County I'm thinking of
moving just for that reason it's the
most dangerous risk I have is being in
the same jurisdiction with a Soros
prosecutor am I wrong I think it's
bigger danger than any natural
disaster by far yeah the odds me dying
in a natural disaster in
California 0.00 one right like hardly
worth thinking about the odds of me
being arrested by a Soros prosecutor on
a on a madeup
charge pretty good it it was well over
10% I don't know what it is but it's
well over
10% all right um there's a story about
this Cornell
professor who said that he when he
watched the Hamas attacks he felt
exhilarated and energ ized by what he
called this challenge to the Monopoly of
power now that's being interpreted as he
was energized and exhilarated by the
murder of innocent
people um he didn't say that exactly but
he didn't say he was mad about it you
know if he didn't mean it it would have
been a good time to say I'm not talking
about the innocent people being
slaughtered or something like that but
he didn't which suggests that uh didn't
care too much about it he might have
cared more about what he felt was some
rebalance of power that he thought was
important I think he's still employed
Cornell is a place I almost went to
college almost went to college there
and I would be pretty embarrassed if I
had I'm sure my own College wasn't do
isn't doing much better all
right um you heard that Clinton said she
wants to uh deprogram anyone who quote
worships at the altar of
magga so Hillary wants to
deprogram conservatives what do you
think of
that is that a good idea or a bad idea
because she's talking about the who are
who who have a cult-like
um belief in Trump C like I'm all for it
are you against it why would you be
against
that if if she can find anybody who has
a cult-like
uh following of trump they should get
deprogrammed I've never met one have you
have you ever met somebody who had a
cult-like belief in
Trump I've never seen it there are
people who love the
show and there people like the politics
you know they like the show and they
like you know his policy
and they think he did a good job but I
don't think I've met anybody who to me
looked like they're somehow
hypnotized so if she wants to find
people that she thinks are hypnotized
and deprogram
them go ahead I don't think she'll find
anybody I mean it's not it wasn't a real
suggestion right however I do think that
the world has reached the point where
deprogramming our fellow citizens is a
requirement for survival
it used to be that we were all crazy
little people in tribes and if he did
some crazy stuff in your tribe the worst
worst that could happen is your tribe
dies and all the other tribes are doing
fine they don't even know you to go on
didn't even have
communication but given that people can
communicate instantly and infect other
people with their ideas and given that
an individual could destroy you know a
gigantic building in a major city or you
know do all kinds of damage given the
individuals have so much power for
Destruction we're going to have to start
deprogramming people I don't think it's
optional do
you you you get that we're reaching a
point where it won't be optional we have
to deprogram the dangerous people they
just will have too much access to
Firepower what what else can you
do now here's a little wild card however
good humans are at programming people
and AI is going to be better not right
away I don't think it's there yet but AI
can learn all the rules of
persuasion and just start reprogramming
people assuming that they use the
internet now it would require the right
you know collection of AI and uh um
platforms and governments to make sure
that the right things are happening and
that's a big F but in theory AI could
look at the problems of people
disagreeing and and could create
something like a deprogramming sub
routine and it could deprogram anybody
so it wouldn't just be you know woke
people on the left and it wouldn't just
be Hamas it could be some people on the
right you don't think there are some
people on the right who need to be
deprogrammed right now I'm not going to
I'm not going to start a big fight and
tell you that the people who believed in
Q should have been
reprogrammed but it would have been been
interesting to see if they had gone
through a course that tried to do it
would it Chang their minds or would the
instructor become a que believer what of
those two things might happen so I'm not
going to say that the reprogramming
applies to only one side but there is a
there's a big qualitative difference in
in how the brainwashing is done on both
sides so there are differences
however uh I thought that I would uh
create for you a uh deprogramming uh
course which I just posted on the
xplatform it's a first draft it's a
first draft of had a
deprogram uh
people and let let me tell you what's on
it all right so it's pretty long just a
first draft now first draft is just
bullet points right so there's no
chapters or anything like there just a
bunch of bullet points sort of organize
a little bit into categories but but let
me tell you what the categories would be
so this would be a a college course to
deprogram people would been let's say
too woke or believe what the Democrats
are
feeding and again Democrats are not the
only people feeding to their
people I'll say that a hundred times
because you need to hear that right
we're all subject to being programmed by
our own team far more than we're
programmed by the other
team so here are the things I would put
on a course to deprogram somebody I
first have a reading list and I would
include my books God's debris and wi
bigley God's debris because it if you
haven't read it you will understand this
but it's basically just a a mind opener
it doesn't try to tell you what's true
or even what's false it's just a fiction
and it's just to open your mind so I
would use that as my first book and
people would say oh that's not true that
thing in that book was wrong and I would
say it's just Fiction it's just so you
can imagine things being different than
your normal view that's all it's just
opening your
imagination then win bigley um is a
story about Trump's persuasion game so
you can learn about
persuasion that's being applied by
everybody all the time but you could
also get a different view of trump
that's opposite of the he's a monster
just so you see it you don't have to
believe it you just have to see what
other people say or how they see the
same
situation I would also want to add to my
reading list books that debunk
hoaxes because there probably a number
of them I think Cheryl ainson probably
has a book on that um so I'd picked the
F the best one or two books that show
how many hoaxes the country has been
subjected to because you give somebody
an idea that this has always been true I
was something that talked about project
mocking birg so you could know that the
CIA once had a mission to program the
country and then I would tell them about
how uh there was a law against that at
one point so the law changed they
couldn't do
that and then Obama I believe changed
the law back so they could and then what
we observe appears to be a massive
influence campaign by our own
intelligence people now I don't know if
it is but if I were training people I
would tell them it used it used to be
done so we know it can be done and
there's a reason to do it then it was
illegal now it's legal again what do you
think is
happening do you think he made it legal
so that nobody would do anything
differently he made it legal so they
would do it you know it specifically to
make sure that it could be done so of
course it's being done Can you spot it
well that would be part of the class so
I would also give them uh a list of what
I call the alleged disinformation
spreaders or you could call them just
the team players the people who are not
trying to inform you of both sides of
anything these are just people who you
could reliably assume are giving you one
narrative you know their team narrative
and some of them would just be pure
Liars all right so I'm not going to dis
distinguish on this list the pure Liars
from the people who are just narrative
Masters you know they're going to give
you their view but here are the ones
that you should at least have a little
flag that goes up now I should do this
for the political
right probably will but at the moment
these are names on the left that are
just a pure signal for fake news right
I'll just redo the names and again this
is
alleged and just being a team player
does does mean you're breaking any laws
just means that you should take anything
they say with a grain of Soul Adam
Schiff Eric swell and by the way if
there's any name on this list you don't
recognize that's a problem that's a
problem because you might run into them
and read their stuff and say well that's
a credible
person
no all right um John Brennan James
Clapper Lawrence
tribe do you recognize the names every
one of them you should not believe a
word they say which is not to say
everything they say is wrong but they
had the lowest credibility of anybody in
the news here's some more uh Jonathan
greenblat the ADL Abby Phillips Max boot
General Hayden Dan Goldman Jamie Rasin
Dean obadia Stefan cson John avlon those
are CNN people uh Glenn Kessler Phil
bump Jennifer
Rubin now before any of them sue me this
is an
opinion based on
observation all right that these are the
people you could trust the least on the
left I could absolutely make the same
list on the right would you all
agree well you're not going to fight me
on that right I could make the same list
same length on the right all right I
haven't done it because I'm just trying
to make this one go down
well but I probably should I should
right yeah and I would make a I would
make a distinction between the let's say
the uh you know the John avlon Stefan
Collinson and the Hanes they're sort of
in the same business they're more
narrative people but that's different
from somebody who will look you in the
eye and just lie that is different right
I I have no reason to believe that
several of these people would have look
you in the eye and just lie but they're
definitely going to leave stuff out and
spin and create a narrative all right
what else I would teach people in this
class the dog not barking rule so
instead of just looking at the news they
would always ask shouldn't there be
something in the news that's not being
mentioned and then teach them the
importance of the dog not barking why is
this all being
ignored right why are we not looking at
this very important
lesson I would teach them about Words
which words are uh the
dangerous persuasive words like
patriarchy colonizer magga extremist
cult member you hear any of those words
and somebody's got violence on their
mind that's important to know all right
um then I would also teach them how to
identify fake news so I just first draft
I put it into three categories things
that are probably true maybe a 5050 and
things that are probably fake and then
other things that are pure propaganda
right so just quickly uh these are
things which are probably true so these
were the Tells for something probably
true not guaranteed but
probably um if one of the sides is
telling you the story the left or the
right news and the other side is
completely ignoring it it's probably
true because if it were not true the
other side would debunk
it if you see a claim and then a debunk
well you're not really sure what's true
and that could work in either Direction
one side makes a claim the other one
debunks it and could go either way but
if one makes a claim shows their
evidence and the other side treats it
like no news happened it's probably true
because there's a that's the dog not
barking there there's a reason it's
being ignored because it's not
convenient all right um if both sides
report the same thing as true it's
probably true right if they both said
there was a hurricane there was probably
a
hurricane um if all the studies forever
have pointed in the same direction no
matter how you do the study that's
probably true I I doubt there are many I
don't think there are too many studies
that show you that smoking cigarettes is
good for your health probably not I mean
within the last I don't know 30 years so
that's probably true Everything points
in One Direction um I like whenever
science matches my own
observations I'm more likely to think
it's true doesn't guarantee it but at
least that's two things going for it the
science plus your own
observation um if if there's one
narrative that predicts better than the
other that's probably true so if you got
the left and the right have different
narratives you know a story of how to
understand something well if one of them
predicts oh these people say for
example uh one narrative is that
Hamas wants real estate so they would
like some real estate in
Israel the other the other narrative
might be that they want to kill all Jews
and the real estate part is more
incidental to the the big plan well
predict if if it's about real estate the
prediction would be that they would
negotiate some kind of a access real
estate right of return maybe give up
something to get
it but if they just want to kill
Jews then you would see something like
what just
happened so which one predicted better
it's pretty clear in this case all right
um so a few other things on there
Witness
Etc here's some coin flips if you see
one scientific paper that hasn't been
peer
reviewed H maybe yes maybe no probably a
little less than a coin flip that is
true what if it's one scientific paper
and it has been
peer-reviewed exactly the same the peer
rreview adds nothing in modern world the
peer rreview has no value at all just
discount it so one scientific paper H
you don't really know know what about a
meta analysis where they looked at a
whole bunch of studies none of those
studies were great but you know they
looked at them all to see what the
overall is nope you can fake meta
studies too easily they're they're not
science or
 about uh if there's a video or
audio of the event and you can actually
see it with your own eyes is it true
you're seeing it with your own eyes
you're listening to it it's about 50/50
if it's political there's about a 50%
chance it was taken out of context and
now you have to add that it might be a
deep fake might not even be real
people uh things that are probably fake
so if you didn't know anything else but
these things you would say it's probably
fake there's a lot of money
involved climate change Wars everything
here about anything that has a lot of
money involved we're not talking about a
little money we're talking about a lot
of money that stuff's usually fake
because the people who have a lot of
money involved can pay to make some fake
news appear they can fund a fake study
they can uh create a fake um what do you
call it a uh thing tank they can create
a fake uh fact checking group they can
create a fake watch door group so if
there's enough money going around they
can make anything that's fake look true
so money is a very strong signal for not
true um what if neither CNN nor Fox news
report it because neither of them think
it's true is it true neither Fox News
nor CNN they both say it's not true
probably not true yeah no guarantees
these are just working with Statistics
if you had one anonymous source is it
true no have you have if you have two
Anonymous sources is it true no
no two Anonymous sources is just like
one it means nothing there's no
evidentiary value of an anonymous source
in politics is most likely not true if
you hear that there are sources like
that um how about a witness under oath
who reporting was somebody else saw or
heard so there's a witness under oath
who says something
like I didn't see the UFOs myself but I
definitely talked to the people who
did is it true no it's never
true no you no I I shouldn't say never
you know maybe but no don't believe
anything like the being under oath means
nothing if you're talking about what
somebody else told you has no value to
be under oath how about there are only
fuzzy photos and videos and that's the
best you can do no it's not true how
about uh a randomized controlled trial a
randomized controlled trial is that
going to be
valid depends who funded
it yeah depends who funded it so
probably not probably not how about a a
randomized controlled trial uh with the
funding is unknown so you don't know who
funded
it nope not going to believe that either
I don't know who funded it it has no
evidentiary value
whatsoever
um what if one site says it's true and
the other side says it
isn't is it true or not true CNN or Fox
News and you can reverse them could be
either way one says it's true and the
other says it's not true probably not
true more likely not
true um what if it's a story about a
public figure is it true or not true
never never chew but stories about
public figures always leave out the
important context always yeah if if you
don't know that everything looks weird
that they don't even do a story about a
political figure unless there's a way
they can distort it to make it
interesting all right how about uh if
the story is new and breaking in the
context of a war so let's say there's a
fresh war and so news comes out is it
true nope nope yeah the only thing that
might be true is that one group of
people is attacking another group of
people that might be true but almost
every other anecdote video
story
data
statistics in in the in the heat of War
none of that's true it's just all
 um and then there's the uh pure
propaganda
uh these are the ones where for example
when context is intentionally omitted I
always tell you about the one where
somebody will give you a raw number but
not tell you if that's a big
percentage that's propaganda and the
reverse they tell you the percentage of
something but they for some weird reason
they leave out the raw number that's
propaganda the only way you can
understand a thing is to know both the
raw numbers and percentage if anybody
down one or the other that's not news
that's
propaganda all right uh if somebody uses
analogies instead of an argument that's
propaganda and it goes like this uh
those magga people are basically like
Hitler in
1939 that's always propaganda right it's
just something reminding you of
something that you turned into hyperbole
that's not
real
about which sources to
trust this one's tough but people need
to know that the news isn't real and I
worry that they do like I I always talk
about my smart Democrat friend I'm
positive he believes that the New York
Times And The Washington Post and CNN
are telling him real news I think he
actually believes that now I think a lot
of the country does because if you'd
never been exposed to to how many
stories are just were obviously fake how
would you know and the people on the
right hear those stories about you know
the debunkings the corrections the you
know the obvious um planted by some
intelligence or FBI or something we hear
that all the time if you're watching all
the news but if you're only watching the
sources
that produce it they'll tell you the
real news how would you know the
difference so anybody who's uh got raped
based on what they thought was real news
probably thinks it still exists except
they're pretty sure the other side is
fake I tell you anybody who says the
news that they're reading is the real
stuff and and the stuff the other people
is reading is fake they're lost that's
as lost as you can be that's maximum
lost once you get to the point where you
don't believe
anything and your best bet is to look
for these tells and signals and then
you're also looking for you know Bull
story
you've got a
chance but if you're only looking at one
side you don't have a chance uh then I
would look I would teach people the
tricks you know the trick about the
headline that doesn't match the story
how many times have we seen that the
headline will say something like uh
Republican Slaughters a group of
people with his car and you're like oh
my God a republican slaughtered a bunch
of people in his car and then you read
the story is like he's a race car driver
and he won the race he slaughtered all
the other competitors you're like what I
thought he killed people now I made that
one up that's not real but the point is
that the headlines will be provocative
and then you read the story and often in
the last
paragraph it will completely debunk its
own story it's a very common political
story to do that um then there's a trick
where you just fake do some fake news
everybody gets excited about it then you
print a correction whoops it was wrong
and 1% of the people who saw the fake
news will ever know that you corrected
it they'll just never see it so you bury
the
correction uh you teach him the Nancy py
wrapup
smear and and basically the way that you
use the news to support your lies so the
way that works I think I have this right
so a politician will tell a lie to a
person in the Press oh this thing is
true the Press will say I've got a
secret source and they'll print the
story and then the person who created
the story will point to the news and say
hey don't believe me believe the news
hey but you wouldn't know that it's only
in the news because that person you're
talking to put it there and that they've
got a a friendly reporter who's willing
to believe them without too much proof
or willing to play along and just do
fake news so if you don't know that
that's a thing that the politicians get
the reporters to report things
anonymously so that the politician can
say it's true because it's in the news
if you if you're unaware of that trick
you're really going to be lost again the
news is going to be confusing but once
you know that trick yeah you can spot
it all right um and then I would do the
hoax quiz you've all seen where I've got
all the the Trump hoaxes and teach
people how those hoaxes were done and
then I would also teach them the Tells
for cognitive dissonance which are if
you're having a discussion with somebody
and you've made a good point if they
counter your point oh they might have a
good argument but if they do one of
these things that I'm going to tell you
they're they're already in cognitive
dissonance and there's nothing you can
do it means that they're having a a
psychological event they're no longer in
the debate one of them is a quick change
of topic well that's a t
all right if you can't even stay on the
topic it means you lost it uh add H in
an attack you make a good point and the
person says well you stupid magot maggot
I'm like what I just made a a point
that's Based on data that you could
check yourself oh you maggots you
maggots believe
everything uh then there's the mind
reading the mind reading oh yeah I know
what you're really thinking and what
you're really thinking is and there's
something you're not thinking and nobody
would everything think yeah the the
crazy mind reading that's a tell the
word salad where they just started
saying words but you listen you're like
I'm not even sure any of that made sense
that's that's a tell people the people
who resort to an analogy and try to sell
you that since the analogy is something
we all understand that that tells you
something about a completely different
situation it doesn't it's just a thing
that reminded you of it if you accept if
you accept their frame you're an idiot
never discussed an analogy do you know
what I do when somebody says well but
what about this they give some analogy I
say well that's a good story about a
completely different situation do you
have that applies to what we're talking
about never engage an analogy best
advice I'll ever give you as soon as you
see the analogy and say no that's just a
different situation I I don't really
want to talk about all the ways it's
different but if you could defend this
situation with actual reasons that'd be
great um there are other the the things
that are too complicated to explain oh I
could I we could talk all day but it's
too complicated you'll never get it
that's sort of a tell and the the so
tell so you're saying that pigs can fly
no no I didn't say anything like that
so you're saying that cars don't have
engines no no I didn't say that so
you're saying that clouds don't exist in
the sky no no not saying any of that you
know the the Jordan Peterson
thing anyway this is the first draft of
a uh course for
correcting um for deprogramming somebody
who's been programmed and yes it could
be done to the left and the right now
here's why it should be
done at the moment we we talk about the
other side needing to be deprogrammed
right blah blah blah do you see it do
you see my blah blah blah if my hand
were not going blah blah blah there'd be
no visual to the story right there's no
visual there's also no
fear right you've got this General sense
that it would be better if people had
you know access to real news but you're
not afraid of it like you're going to
run away so your two biggest tools of
persuasion are not available to you it's
not a so scary somebody has to run away
and do something right away and there's
no visual element to it it's just this
idea that people should be deprogrammed
and that's
why there needs to be an actual
entity ideally a physical location you
know ideally but that that that's a lot
to ask but at the very least there
should be a book or a course guide you
should be able to put a picture of the
course guide on the xplatform and say
hey if you want to see if you need to be
deprogrammed here's the guide check it
out see see how many hoaxes you believe
in now that's why the the um the hoax
quiz that I created has been so
successful how many of you seen my hoax
quiz uh on a platform
somewhere most of you I think most of
you have seen it right and the reason
you've seen it is because it's portable
it's really easy to take a screenshot I
made I made sure it wasn't so long there
like multiple Pages it's like just nice
tight little list and the fact that I
made it
physical is what made it visual so it's
not just that there are a bunch of
things that are questionable it's that
you can see them on a
list you can you look at them so this
idea of
deprogramming uh the left or
deprogramming Hamas or whoever you think
needs to be deprogrammed you need to
turn it into an actual uh product it's
got to be a document or a building or
there has to be a a
professor you know an actual class with
a time a location and a technique
once you get that going then you can
have a real conversation about how
programmed we are as opposed to making
good
decisions so uh I don't think it needs
to be a book if it's book siiz nobody's
going to read it that's that's the
trouble you're not going to get anybody
if it's book
sized all right here's a few other
things uh there's a trump gag
order federal judge Tanya cheuck in so
it's a tailored big gag order for Trump
so he's not allowed to uh uh disparage
Witnesses prosecutors or Court
employees
now the trouble would be as someone I
think the editorial board at the W
Street Journal pointed
out imagine if uh Trump got in a debate
with Mike Pence because Mike Pence is a
witness to the January 6 stuff he
wouldn't be able to criticize Mike
Pence because the court wouldn't let
him he he would anyway I'm sure but and
now that's probably not going to be not
going to come up but you don't think
Trump should be able to criticize his
his uh opponents at an
election of course he should be able to
criticize
them so uh I've seen some people uh
helpfully suggest that You' violate the
order and go to jail but that's easy for
you to say
it it's easy for us to be sitting here
and say you know what you know it would
be a good strategy for someone else if
they would go to jail but just for a
little while no that's not a good
strategy for other people I mean it
might happen but you don't want to make
that happen nobody wants to spend a
night in jail just to get a little more
power I mean I don't think Trump does
although it would give him more
power so um I believe this will help him
and you know the thing that would help
Trump the most would be if somebody put
a gag order on him that he couldn't say
anything about the election
ever right into office because you
know 95% of Trump's risk is whatever he
says between now and election day am I
right 95% of his risk is what he says
between now an election day because
that's what they'll be
attacking in my opinion Trump has
brilliantly stayed under the provocation
line and it looks
intentional because he knows how to
provoke we all know that he knows where
the line is and he knows what is too far
he's going up to the line but he's not
Crossing it and that appears to be a
brilliant political strategy because the
thing that people you know worry the
most about him is that he goes too far
like he's he's the goes too far guy so
if he's if he gives you a solid year of
not going too far you're going to say to
yourself oh I get it it it was always
optional and when it worked he went too
far because it got him attention but
when the going too far caused more
trouble than it was solving he pulled it
back now that would be a big confidence
Builder even for the people on the right
to see that he can moderate because
they're not so sure he can moderate they
feel like he's just crazy guy doing
crazy stuff that is so not what who he
is he's very very strategic even with
the provocative stuff very strategic so
it would help a lot the people were
worried about him to just see him you
know be somewhere closer to the middle
in terms of his
provocations but of course he he's he's
always
provocative all right uh
Lakers ex player Rick
Fox he's uh working with some company
that's building houses and of concrete
that can suck the CO2 right out of the
atmosphere so there's a kind of concrete
that will absorb CO2 into it as opposed
to producing more CO2 than the concrete
sucks so I don't think that's going to
be the big solution to anything but
there it is so it's kind of interesting
now how many of you follow Ste Steve
Malloy uh at junk science so he
questions climate change mostly uh I I
swear it is so interesting following his
account because it's a whole parallel
world in which everything's
opposite and I don't I don't know he's
right or wrong I just don't have the
qualifications to do it but I'll tell
you what I think I
know what I think I know is that he uses
only the government's own data
so when he makes a claim about the
temperature has or has not changed or a
claim about the CO2 levels my
understanding is he's using only
official government
data and then he shows it to you in a
variety of ways to show you that there's
no relationship between CO2 and
temperature
historically now that's not my claim I'm
telling you that he's using official
data he's showing his work and he's
saying look for yourself
now his claim would be that there hasn't
been any identifiable warming in quite a
few recent years so that's claim number
one um but also even more provocative is
the claim that the data shows clearly
that temperature goes first and then
CO2 uh goes up with temperature so it's
not temperature it's not CO2 causing
temperature it's temperature causing CO2
because when you look at the data you
can see that the temperature went up
before the
CO2 now that's the claim that's not my
claim it's the
claim now what do you think are the odds
that the entire scientific
Community didn't
notice that the that the causation was
backwards is that possible the the
entire industry not noticing that the
correlation was backwards
it's entirely
possible it is entirely
possible every day almost I didn't do it
today almost every day well I guess this
is the example I tell you about a
scientific study that appears to have
causation backwards and obviously so
like
obviously right it is stuff
like uh people who went to jail become
criminals
and I'll be like well I think wasn't it
the crime that made them go to
jail like isn't that obvious and and you
know there's never been a study that
says that exact thing that was just an
example
but if if with no scientific EV uh
background whatsoever I can look at the
news about studies and to me they look
backwards they all look backwards the
most famous one is that moderate
moderate alcohol use made you
healthier day one I said uh that's
backwards
correlation the people who can afford
Daily Light drinking and are not
alcoholics that's a whole separate
category but if you could afford to have
a bottle of wine every
day and you're not an alcoholic you just
like having wine with dinner what does
that say about you well it says you you
know how to moderate number one right if
if you did nothing but put the people
who know how to moderate anything in
their life they know how to
quit that group is always going to be
healthier than the other groups it's
obvious you they're they're richer
richer people live longer and are
healthier they have better health care
Etc and being able to afford wine with
dinner is clearly correlated with you
know doing
well
so if you and I can see example after
example where it appears don't know for
sure but it looks like they got the
causation backwards and obviously
so you don't think they that the entire
industry could get climate change
backwards I'm not saying they have
because it's a data argument and I don't
believe any
data but it's
absolutely easily possible it is easily
possible so that's why I love the uh the
Steve Malloy stuff because he's using
their own data and he shows you his work
well what else they ask for is there
something else you want that's about all
you can do and it's like he's out there
yelling all by himself because there
aren't a lot of people who are you know
echoing his same point of view or at
least not you know an official
capacity so that's
interesting uh
um what about this question of why
nobody wants the Palestinian
refugees you've heard that the
neighboring countries don't want to let
them in uh but they don't give reasons
now I assume the reasons are obvious
right because they have uh
mindsets that would cause trouble so
it's not because they're Islamic
obviously because the countries involved
are also is
so they have no problem with the
religion there must be something about
the specific way this group of people
were uh let's say
brainwashed and here's a reframe that I
think could change everything I don't
think it will but but you know we're all
desperate for just a different way to
look at the situation that that could
give you some kind of alternate path
because all the paths that we can think
of are terrible here's the alternate
path if somebody if somebody went let's
say to war and they came back with
PTSD would you ignore it or would you
treat it like a mental problem a mental
disorder well I would say that that's a
health problem and a big one right if
somebody had trauma in their childhood
of any other
kind and it seem to be affecting them in
their adult life
is that somebody who has a mental
disorder I would say so so they start
with a perfectly healthy brain so we're
not talking about anybody's genetic
makeup right has nothing to do with your
genes uh you could just be a victim of
trauma and it changes your
brain well to me it seems that the uh
Palestinians are not only victims of a
certain kind of
trauma right because you know that they
have a a certain narrative that's been
given to them that they're
victims and then a certain lifestyle
which is suboptimal so they're feeling
maybe physical stress of having a tough
life on top of that the mental stress
that somebody's doing it to you
intentionally and maybe you should you
know get back at them so I would treat
the Palestinians and we're not talking
about Hamas only Hamas probably just
needs to be killed I'm talking about the
alans who largely have similar thoughts
to Hamas except not uh operational like
they're not going to do anything about
it but they might sympathize with the
general approach but maybe not the
specific killing that they
did if you were to bring those people
into your country you'd be importing
mental
illness at at a scale we've never
seen now do I think that the people
coming across our Southern border have
mental
illness well some probably do because
it's a big population but I don't think
that's why they're coming and I would
say that most of them are just had tough
lives which gives you a little trauma
but it's the kind of trauma that tough
people can get past and by the time you
make it all the way here you're pretty
tough right so I'm not really worried
that people coming across our Southern
border have some kind of mental
defect like that's a whole different
problem there they're just you know you
know what the problems are but with the
Palestinians I would treat it like a
mental problem and the way you would
treat it um if we're mental and I and
specifically it's like a mind virus
because you can actually transmit it you
could teach kids to think the same way
and feel the same trauma and they would
end up with PTSD too because they would
interpret everything as somebody else's
you know cause so that they would feel
like
victims and I'm not saying they're not
victims that they do look pretty much
like victims
but um if we were to treat them
compassionately what what would you do
if your only goal was
compassion you would number one keep
them where they are that' be number one
because you wouldn't want them to take
their mental illness into the rest of
your
population right has nothing to do with
their religion has nothing to do with
their genes or even culture per se
because there are lots of cultures where
they're not violent but they're
otherwise
similar so it's about this specific
teaching that's happening there this
specific narrative and that's a mental
virus I would I would isolate it first
but of course you would do everything
you could to make their life comfortable
but then you would absolutely have to
deprogram them you would have to
deprogram them before you allowed them
into polite Civilization now I would say
the same thing about our college
students you've seen that uh college
students in America are being uh they're
they're mentally unwell because they've
been damaged by a certain kind of
training that is guaranteed to make you
mentally incompetent it will make you
believe things that aren't true and see
and see oppression where it doesn't
exist or at least put too much attention
on it Etc so I think that what we need
is something like what I just described
as a deprogramming course so that if
somebody came to me and said I'd like a
job with you uh I have all these
qualifications and I have a degree from
Harvard or
Berkeley I want to be able to say to
them have you been through the
deprogramming
course and if they have and and if they
can show me that they have I would
actually hire them even if they had
views I didn't
like because I would say if you took
that seriously and you actually went
through
that I can respect
that right I I would be willing to ire
somebody under those conditions but if
somebody just came right out on one of
those institutions I'd be very hesitant
to mix them with my staff who are not
mentally
ill
so we need to we need a physical
real program for deprogramming our
college students and we need a physical
real program for deprogramming um the
Palestinians now you might say to me
Scott you're really talking about
brainwashing
children like we don't brainwash
children to which I say that's all we do
we only brainwash children do you know
why we do that because they're not
capable of making
decisions you have to brainwash them you
don't make it optional that you look
twice before you cross the road anybody
tell their kid you know you don't have
to look twice you don't have to look in
both directions no you say you look
twice or I'll never look let you out of
the house again whoa whoa whoa I saw you
look one way you didn't look the other
way stop you know you're never leaving
the house again until I see you looking
both ways basic stuff right
so
um that's what I think the world needs
uh we should stop talking about
deprogramming and we need to implement
it is the single most important thing in
the world and it would solve not only
America's problem but the Middle
East um and I can't think of anything
else that would work
so I'd love to see some
experimentation to see if various
approaches would actually change
anybody's at least amount of extremism
you know you don't need to change their
minds entirely but you could talk out of
wanting to be violent that probably
could
work for
many
um if you look at
Germany in in
2023 could you conclude that you can
brainwash an entire country and then you
can unb brainwash them in the other
direction sometimes too far in the other
direction it's obvious right because if
you look at you know Germany under
Hitler it's completely opposite of
Germany today and some would say you
went so far that you know your brains
are falling out uh which is a separate
convers ation but you can you can
literally brainwash an entire um
Civilization now probably in Germany the
the key to it is that at least one
generation went through totally
brainwashed right the old people you
can't do much with them but the new
people you can you can bring on the new
generations fully brainwashed when they
reach a
doood now here's something I haven't
heard talked about
uh in the Palestinian areas who controls
our education
systems and because it's religious
religious school right they don't
separate school and
religion if if Israel or maybe some
other friendly Arab countries yeah if
somebody doesn't take control of the
schools then you just have to keep it an
open air
prison so the the way to make it not a
prison is to start training the children
to be good citizens and then you could
let the children out but the old people
I don't know who who's going to take
them if they've been poisoned and are
not trying to fix themselves poisoned by
bad
ideas all right that ladies and
gentlemen is my suggestion for fixing
the world we should get serious about
the deprogramming and you know what if
Hillary Clinton wants to pull together
an actual deprogramming course for what
she knows the mega
extremists I take a look I take a look
maybe there's something in there that
actually would be productive but I don't
think the average Republican right I
don't think the average Republican needs
to
deprogrammed all right that's all I've
got for today I G to say goodbye to the
Twitter and YouTube folks and I will
talk to you tomorrow
locals I'll be talking to you because
you're
special
