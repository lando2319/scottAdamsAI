fun
good morning and welcome to
the best part of your entire day
yeah and we're gonna do something here
uh very special
something that i totally haven't done
yet today
and it's called the simultaneous sip if
you'd like to join me all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker chalice or
stein i can't eat jugger flask of vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine head of the day
you think
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
first one of the day
as far as you know
all right let's talk about something
interesting for a change how would you
like that
it's a big change i know
but
apparently china i saw one report on
this from the spectator index
twitter account
and it says that china will limit minors
to playing online games
just three hours a week
with services limited to an hour each
friday saturday and sunday
so if you're a kid in china
the total amount of video games you can
play is
one hour for each of the three weekend
days
now
what does that suggest well it suggests
it might be boring to live in china if
you're a teenager
but
it makes me wonder about the whole
chinese
system versus the american system
because you know i think president xi
of china
has made a point that their system
should be superior in the future
and they do have a few advantages let me
list a few
number one
they can block their teenagers from
playing video games all day
is that good
i don't know
i really don't
you know your your common sense tells
you it's
you know destroying brains
but while kids are playing these video
games is they're very stimulated
and they're doing hand-eye coordination
they've got to think and plan
they're competing they have if they have
their headphones on they're talking to
other people they're being social
they're coordinating they're planning
i'm not entirely sure that video games
are bad for kids especially the ones
where they they've got the headphones on
and they're talking to their friends
online at the same time they're playing
and stuff
i feel
i feel like they might be wrong about
this
yeah i get why they're doing it probably
every parent has the same impulse right
your your impulse and your common sense
is you don't want kids staring at a
screen and playing with their thumbs
eight hours a day
um but here's what else china can do
that we can't do
they can get much better control of
their drug addiction
not only
can the chinese with their harsh system
and their full surveillance people not
only can they
keep people from getting addicted
but
they can make us addicted so they can
send us their fentanyl and get their
competitor addicted and dying all like
crazy
while at the same time keeping their own
public from having the same problem
how big of a problem is addiction to
modern society
if you were to rate addiction
on a scale of one to ten
for how big a problem it is to society
it's like a nine isn't it
it's yeah it's it's
i don't know 10 is probably nuclear war
or something but
it's like a nine
and
china will be in a much better shape for
avoiding that
nine sized problems
here's another one uh
i think in america
we can't cheat as much against our
rivals
now this is sort of speculation so i'm
assuming this is true yeah i would take
a fact check on this for sure but it
seems to me
that an american company could just
blatantly break the law and
spy on a chinese company or steal their
ip
without fairly large risk
but it looks like a chinese company can
do anything they want
to a foreign company in their country or
anywhere else because their government
would support it so long as it's you
know good for the competition of china
it's good for china
so i feel as though
our system doesn't allow us to cheat
when we're competing as much you know
i'm sure there's some cheating going on
everywhere
so
we'll have we might have more video game
addiction but i don't know if that's a
plus or a minus less we would have more
drug addiction
we're more susceptible to cheating
these are some big things
these are some big deals if you're
trying to figure out which country is
going to dominate in the future
um
and then here's another one this is
really big
susceptibility to propaganda
now let's assume that both the united
states and a we'll take china as our
totalitarian example both of them are
hugely successful
susceptible to propaganda
and i would say completely
right i don't think there's more
propaganda in china than there is in the
united states
i probably wouldn't have said that
always
but at the moment i i could say this
with confidence i don't think we have
any less propaganda
it's just just comes from different
sources
in our case it comes from the you know
the different teams they just do the
propaganda themselves whereas in china
the government does it all
so we both have terrible propaganda but
there's a big difference
in china the propaganda is controlled by
the government which means that they can
control it in a way that's good for the
nation even if it's not good for the
people
whereas in the united states it's just a
fight between two competing
groups just destroying the country by
tearing it apart
so it seems to be that although both
china and the united states would be
fully propagandized
china could do it in a more controlled
engineered way to get a specific outcome
in the united states it's a it's a
free-for-all we don't know who's going
to win the propaganda war
we don't know who's going to be more
persuasive on any given topic i think
that's a disadvantage
it would be an advantage
if we had a good news
industry
in that case we would have accurate news
the chinese citizens would have
inaccurate news and maybe that would
give us some advantage but since we're
both getting inaccurate news and we
can't tell the difference then i would
say the one who can engineer that
inaccurate news the best which would be
china
might have an advantage
so what would be the advantage of our
system
only one that i know of only one
advantage that i know of now i'm not
talking about lifestyle because there
might be a number of lifestyle
advantages of freedom
but in terms of the strength of the
total country
i think our biggest advantage is
creativity
and risk taking
meaning that we allow it we allow people
to do crazy things and just destroy
themselves
but every now and then somebody is the
wright brothers and they created a
create a lighter than air
not lighter there but they create a
flying machine
so
there's something about the
permissiveness of our system that allows
creativity to come out and so far
that's been the difference the biggest
difference is creativity now somebody
says capitalism but i think i think they
have a lot of that advantage in china as
well at the moment
um
yeah so i think invention and risk
taking were are our only enduring
advantages and we'll see if that's
enough
um
here's some prediction tracking now i've
mentioned this before but i'd like to
keep reminding you
one of the ways that you can predict is
by assuming that people act the same all
the time
okay
you can't trust people to tell you the
truth
in fact i would say you shouldn't trust
anybody
or you shouldn't trust anything that
anybody says just automatically
here's what you can trust are you ready
this is like a really
really important reframing
so every now and then i'll i'll make a
little statement that could change you
know
change your life entirely this is one of
them so just pay attention to this some
of you this will be life-changing i it
really will
you can't trust what anybody says
let's start with that now i know you're
going to say to yourself well i can
trust some people
no
wait for the reframe
you can't trust anything
that anybody
says is true
just start with that to protect yourself
now you have to make decisions right you
still have to live in the real world you
still have to
decide what to do and so part of that
decision making is figuring out who's
telling you the truth or not
here's what i would say instead of
trusting what people say which you
should never trust
trust that people will be the same as
they always have
trust that the person
who's giving you the information
is the same person they were yesterday
that
you can usually trust it's not a hundred
percent
nothing is right
but
trust that people will be the same as
the last time that you dealt with them
so it's sort of the maya angelou thing
you know when somebody shows you who
they are believe them the first time
because it's coming back right
you're going to see them asking the same
way again
so if you don't believe it the first
time you're going to be surprised all
right so here's
here's how this works
um if you if
if you're gonna look at the arizona
audit
situation and you're trying to predict
where it's gonna go can you can you say
that anything that anything has anybody
said about it so far
you should trust
no
so if there are people who said the
audit has found nothing
should you trust them
no
how about the people who told you oh
there's definitely something there oh
wait wait do you see what we got should
you trust them
no
no
so the two things you shouldn't trust at
all is people saying they definitely
have some stuff and they'll show it to
you later
and people who say they definitely don't
have any stuff because there's nothing
there don't trust them
now use the reframe and trust
trust that people will act like people
okay so that's your reframe
people will act the way people have
acted before
if you have a big complicated audit and
it's full of people
and people are blabbers
are people who have always been blabbers
going to stop being blabbers suddenly
no no you can trust
the human beings
we'll have an x number of blabbers
people who will talk about things
they're not supposed to talk about in
any large group
every time
you don't have to wonder
if this large group of auditors had any
blabbers in it of course it did
100 chance there were blabbers where are
the blabbers telling us that they've
already found the stuff and my god you
won't believe it and here's the you know
here's the area in which this fraud has
been found
no blabbers
no blabbers
so my prediction is
that because people are always the same
if if the
arizona had found stuff
there would be plenty of people who knew
about it
and some of those people not all of them
some of them would be blabbers
you would know by now
right so i'm gonna i'm gonna take this
as a prediction technique
doesn't mean it predicted right this
time right because everything is about
the odds but the odds are
there's something with this many people
involved
people are the same everywhere all the
time
they're the same as they were they're
not the same as each other they're the
same as they used to be and they used to
be blabbers nothing changed that if you
haven't heard anything what are the odds
that there's something there
every day that goes by and you don't
hear about it with some specifics
the odds of anything being there go way
way way down now it doesn't mean i'm
right
it is a prediction technique just track
it and see if i'm right
there's a new propaganda
documentary
whose name i may or may not have written
down something like fox news and the big
lie i think that's what it's called
and the idea is it's a documentary
showing that
fox news according to the theme of the
documentary was
culpable in spreading what they call the
big lie
about the election
now i haven't seen the documentary yet
but it's getting a lot of attention on
social media but there was one part
uh
that i thought was quite interesting
um did you know this
that you remember cindy powell was
talking about smartmatic one of the
one of the vendors that do voting
machine technology i don't know if i
can't remember if they're software or
hardware smartmatic are they software or
hardware doesn't matter to my point
but
um
did you know that when you were
listening to all those allegations that
smartmatic had some issues
according to this article on
cnn
it says that
that in 2020 smartmatic only had a there
was only one
contract for doing anything in the
united states so in the year 2020 there
was only one county it was a big one it
was la county but probably didn't matter
to the overall outcome
that only smartmatic was only operating
in one county
in the whole whole country
and the allegation is that fox news left
that out
because your idea of how big the
potential problem was
is very different if the vendor is only
operating in one county
so
but here's the thing when i read this
the way it was written was as if they
were trying to mislead me this was on
cnn it was written
so here's the actual sentence the
company accused of orchestrating a
nationwide election fraud
had a single contract
in the 2020 election
to provide a new voting system in la
county
that's it that's an ambiguous sentence
isn't it
let me read it again
see if you how you interpret this one
sentence the company so this is talking
about smartmatic the company
the company accused of orchestrating a
nationwide election fraud
had a single contract in the 2020
election to provide a new voting system
in la county
so one way to read this
is that smartmatic had a trivial amount
of
involvement in the election
i feel like that's what they want me to
get out of this sentence
but if you break it apart it seems
overly
specific do you know how to identify a
liar
they have an overly specific denial
did you
kill bob on tuesday
no i didn't kill bob on tuesday
see what i mean if you're if your denial
is too specific it's usually an
indication of lying
and the way this was written is that
they had one contract in 2020
to provide a new voting system in la
county
what's left out of that sentence
did they have any existing contracts
they had
they had only one
new voting system contract
the word new was there they had one
new
voting system contract in one county
is this telling us that they had lots of
other existing contracts they're just
not new
i don't know i can't tell
but i don't know who's doing the
propaganda here
did fox news
leave that out
which would be
a propaganda like mistake no matter what
their intent was or is cnn
shading the story in a way that's just
completely misleading
yeah now dominion is another story right
now let me uh
let me emphasize that to my knowledge
there is no evidence of either
smartmatic or dominion doing anything
illegal or inappropriate
i want to say that clearly so i don't
get banned from social media to my
knowledge
there is no credible evidence
that's been presented that i've ever
seen
that looks like either of them did
anything bad
now
keep in mind my larger
philosophy
is that any kind of automated system can
be
corrupted
and that given the number of intel
agencies that would love to do it
it will happen we just don't know if
it's happened yet
so corruption of automated systems for
voting
is largely guaranteed
you just don't know when it's going to
happen so that's the part i don't know
well the afghanistan war is over or is
it
it feels creepy and
disgusting
to say that this war is over
is everybody with me on this
to say that the afghanistan war is over
is creepy and disgusting
because it's not over for some people
who are trapped there it's not over for
our allies that we stranded it's not
over for the service dogs we left at the
airport allegedly i don't know if that's
true
um so
i wouldn't call it over but at least the
last soldiers have left allegedly and
who knows if that's even true um now
lara logan is reporting that or tweeting
that from senior u.s sources
that the house to house executions
have already started
and now we don't know who they're
executing but we presume it was people
who supported the united states or the
afghan government
maybe other people maybe maybe gays
maybe
at least one folk singer
was taken out and shot ned
he sings
let me say that again
a folk singer was dragged out of his
home and shot in the head
not because he was singing
anti-government or anti-taliban stuff
but because he sings
so they dragged him out and shot him in
the head
because music outside of a religious
context is forbidden
by the taliban although the taliban has
been doing their
their uh act i'll call it of acting more
progressive and they said well we're not
going to make a big deal about the music
but it is
anti-islamic they say
so
the thinking at least the reporting is
that maybe kabul doesn't have so much
executions but the places where there's
less media and less fewer eyeballs
that they might be executing people like
crazy
so there's that
um
here's uh
here's your latest cnn propaganda by
anecdote i told you that there will be
exactly one anecdotal
story basically about somebody who
didn't get the vaccination
uh
and then died so it's going to be
something about people who made the
wrong choice according to cnn and they
killed them
so there'll be one per day and here's
the one per day
daniel wilkinson a u.s army veteran died
from a treatable illness
after being unable to find an icu bed in
five different states
his mother tells blah blah
so here's somebody who didn't have kovid
he's a us army veteran which of course
means a little more to us today right
if you were going to do a story about
something bad that happened to a u.s
army veteran
today would be the day to do that story
because we're all feeling
unusually close to our military
is that is that a fair statement
wouldn't you say that as of today
that you as a citizen of the united
states let's say
don't you feel close
to your military
do you feel that i feel close to them
meaning you know connected
like you know we're sort of all in this
together that wasn't always the case you
know it's it's a luxury in this country
that you can let the military go off and
fight their wars and you can think about
other stuff i mean that's a gigantic
luxury but at the moment we do feel
close to them and so when cnn does a
story about an army veteran who died
because the evil people this would be
their their take not mine
because the evil people who didn't get
vaccinations filled up all the icus and
now an army veteran who we should be
respecting and
showing our best
died from it
died from it now
this
assuming the reporting is correct this
would be
a huge
tragedy but
it's worse than that right because of
the army veteran part
like here's an army veteran who like
gives his
you know risks his life and to the
largest and gave his you know his living
life
to the country
and what the country gave back to him
was a big fu and no icu bet and i guess
you're just gonna die
so it's a horrible anecdotal persuasion
story but it's pretty good
persuasion wise
so watch the technique one once you see
it you can't unsee it and the technique
is this
one headline per day
on this topic on cnn's site every day
every day until until everybody's
vaccinated or we all die from covet
well apparently when biden was at the
military ceremony for the returning um
deceased veterans
he did check his watch about five times
now if you go to honor the dead
especially military and their families
are there
please have your
aides take your watch away
because you do not want to be seen
checking your watch
in this situation but joe biden was five
separate times
why does the president need to check his
watch
can somebody tell me
why he would need to check his watch
what exactly
somebody says meds
i feel like that might be it
i feel like it might be his meds
it could also be a uh a nervous stick
yes i was going to say that if i don't
have anything to do
i check the time a lot
it doesn't really mean anything it just
means i didn't have anything to do so i
checked the time a lot
um
so i'm not sure that this was you know
anything except an old man who wasn't
thinking clearly
because he's the president of the united
states i suppose that's a pretty big
deal
um
but oh my god could he embarrass us
anymore
now even cnn as you know has turned
against him i don't i haven't watched
enough msnbc to see if they've turned
against biden yet but cnn has turned
against him
and i would say that
as a compliment to cnn
sorry
sorry i know i know nobody here wants to
hear me compliment cnn
but
i didn't know if they would be able to
turn against him no matter what he did
but boy did they
and i'm going to make i'm going to
speculate here
you know a big network like cnn there
will be lots of voices and people in
charge and the on-air talent has a
certain amount of
credibility and weight etc but there is
one
there's one voice on cnn
that i think is stronger than the others
who would you say that is
if i told you there's one voice on cnn
that's probably stronger than the others
i imagine all right so i'm just
speculating here but i imagine that when
we're not watching
there's somebody there who's stronger
than the other players
yeah
it's funny i'm watching over on locals
everybody's guessing it's jake tapper
that's who i think it is
yeah i think jake tapper just guessing i
think he has a larger
let's say just a little bit more weight
there
partly because yeah his show is popular
he does a good job and he knows what
he's talking about but as you know i've
worked with jake
in the past we did some fundraising for
veterans now if you've watched jake
tapper you know that his
his concern and interest for veterans
has been consistent
and 10 out of 10.
right
say what you will about the reporting
about cnn you can say what you want but
jake tappers a consistent respect for
veterans has been unquestionable
would you give me that
would you give me that
that jake tapper's respect
for veterans
has been a 10 out of 10
consistent over the years
yeah he's really good on that topic and
i've worked with him on that
um
so
i think maybe he's their biggest
influence
because i can't imagine
that given you know jake tapper's
affection for the military etc that he
could
be on cnn and give
give biden a pass
i don't think jake tapper
could ever give biden a pass
for what he did in afghanistan and i
think that that basically forces cnn's
hand because you couldn't have one of
your main
people saying biden is
screwing everything up
while the other opinion people were
saying the opposite kind of
you know they kind of need to get on the
same page so i'm just speculating i
think he's probably the strongest voice
there behind the scenes just to guess
based on you know what i know of him and
his capabilities
and i'll bet that once he flipped on
biden
that the rest of them
kind of had to follow suit just to guess
pure speculation
all right
um as you know
the afghanistan withdrawal i've uh
we've called that the big botch
the big bunch
and uh
and even stefan collinson over at cnn is
writing an opinion piece
saying that uh biden completely
screwed the pooch on that so once you've
got the main anti-trumper writing
anti-biden opinion pieces which he did
today i think it's not the first one i
think he's done a few
that's pretty serious
cnn is done with biden
what does that mean
i feel like that's a big deal
because not only is cnn done with biden
i think they're done with democrats
because who else are they promoting
not kamala harris right you don't see
them uh praising nancy pelosi
even though i think you know she's
pretty credible person for her team
um
i don't know i feel like something's
happening here i think biden
just destroyed
the narrative that the democrats had a
better plan it just looks like it's been
destroyed
did you see the video of a helicopter
looked like a blackhawk helicopter say
people who know what helicopters look
like
and
it was in kabul and it looks like the
taliban somehow was flying a helicopter
and hanging somebody from the bottom of
the helicopter
it looks like they used the helicopter
to dangle
somebody they hung
from a rope and they were flying around
did you see that
i'm going to call that fake news
all right i saw it on social media and
it was reported
it was reported that
it was a hanging now there are two
things i doubt number one
number one
uh i thought i saw his hands moving
i wasn't sure but if his hands were
moving obviously he wasn't being hung
so that's my first question did i see
his hands moving did anybody else see it
looked like his hands were free
number two we don't know who it was
or why
now
the place your brain goes to is that it
was probably some uh american ally
or you know a folk singer or something
so your hand your your mind immediately
goes to it's whatever is the worst case
scenario of a revenge killing and it
might have been it might have been
exactly that which would be horrible
but
it could have been just a criminal it
could have been a member of the taliban
who did something that the taliban
didn't like remember they hang people
for all kinds of reasons
they kill people for all kinds of
reasons
one of the reasons that they might want
to kill somebody publicly
is to gain further control over a city
that's maybe hard to control now i'm not
saying they should
but the more brutal you are probably the
more control you get over the population
so it's possible that it could have been
just a criminal
it could it could have been a you know a
taliban who was a a traitor it could
have been anything
so here's the thing
it looked like the worst thing i've ever
seen
and maybe it was it could have been
exactly what you think it was a revenge
killing that they did in public from one
of our helicopters
horrible
but
there's a real good chance it wasn't
that at all
i just don't know what it was so i'm
gonna call fake news on that
uh only because there's so much fog of
war that we don't even know if a person
got hung or
or who it was or why
you wanna hear some good news
this is just about the best news i've
ever heard but we don't know if it's
gonna go to completion yet so
representative maria elvira salazar
and a dozen republican lawmakers
they're launching this uh plan
that would allow some kind of wireless
communications for any a place that
didn't have it
let's say there was a natural disaster
and they needed to put quick
communications up so they would have
some kind of
either helium balloons or satellites or
some kind of
i think it's somewhat
undefined so far but they would they
would fund the development of some kind
of an emergency internet that would be
used not only where there's a natural
disaster which could make a huge deal
but also if there's a rogue regime
that shuts down the internet access
now
you're way ahead of me
do i not understand that elon musk
is putting in place and has put in place
a lot
of satellites that would give everybody
um
everybody's cell phone and alternate
network that's there all the time
am i wrong
that elon musk starlink
could do this
now i don't know if he'd want to and i
don't know what the capacity is and all
that and i also don't know if your phone
would necessarily just automatically use
this network
but
are we right at the verge where elon
musk can do what the government can't do
which is provide emergency internet
to any place on earth
by pushing a
button is he building that
and do you know how important that would
be
because like i said for china to have an
advantage over the united states they
need to control the propaganda and the
information
what happens if they can't do that
anymore
what happens if anybody can just uh flip
a switch
and the next thing you know they're on
the starlink network i mean i don't know
if that's possible but
i don't know i i've got a feeling that
just the fact that we're seriously
thinking about how to give internet to
people who have been cut off of internet
seems like a civilization changing idea
so let me give a shout out again to
representative maria salazar
um you are doing good work and that
would put you in the one percent of
congress
because congress is largely completely
worthless
uh i'm not sure this is
the details of the bill are exactly what
it needs to be but
you're doing the right stuff all right
so congratulations
elected representative salazar from
florida it's always florida
uh it's always florida or texas isn't it
doing exactly the right stuff
all right um
i'm going to now mention some
vaccination stuff without trying to make
you feel like i'm talking you into it
okay
can we agree on that
i don't know exactly how to talk about
stuff without making you think that i'm
persuading you but i don't want to do
that i just want to mention some
interesting new things
number one
a new study says the modernity
vaccination has twice as many antibodies
as pfizer
so remember you know how you haven't
heard about the moderna needing a
booster you sort of assumed it was
coming
but it's conspicuously absence from the
news right
wouldn't you think that would be in the
news every single day
oh the pfizer requires a booster
and the other one is the moderna
and then what nothing
the modernity doesn't need a booster
nobody's saying it
now i'm guessing that you still will
need a booster or at least it will be
recommended why am i saying that even
though the moderna
has twice as many antibodies as the
pfizer shot why do i predict
that the modernity will need a booster
too is it because of my great scientific
understanding that even the manure could
wear off over time
no
follow the money
right
even when the money shouldn't be
predictive
why is it that it always is
it shouldn't be
you think that it would be science alone
that would determine whether you need a
booster for the moderna
but as long as the economics say you do
need one
is there any chance it won't happen
it feels like it's just guaranteed
by the fact that
they'd make more money
and they're they control the data
if you control the data and you would
make
billions of dollars
if you show the data one way versus
maybe another way what's going to happen
i think the data is going to
coincidentally look the way that makes
you billions of dollars
i know that's super cynical and the
world doesn't always work that way and
i'm not saying it does
i'm saying that if you made predictions
as if the world always worked that way
you would be astonished how often you're
right and you won't know why
it'll fool you like you'll even be
surprised like oh i'm surprised that
worked
joe rogan
seems to be pretty angry that he he sold
a bunch of tickets to madison square
garden for his upcoming show
in october but from the time that he
announced the show
new york city
required vaccinations for anybody going
to public events and so now joe rogan
has sold a bunch of tickets and people
already bought the ticket
and after they bought the ticket
they find out they can't go unless they
get a vaccination
so
joe rogan to his credit is saying they
can get their money back because he's
not going to he doesn't want to be part
of forcing people to get vaccinations
so
you can get your money back from a joe
rogan show and damn it joe rogan that
just makes me want to go to your show
why do you do that it makes me want to
fly across the country and just go to
the show
just because you said
that you won't put up with this forced
vaccination stuff
so he continues to make
a popular and smart decisions
so um that's a little commercial for joe
rogan who totally totally earned it
um here's some more fake news and how to
recognize it
so cnn is reporting that although this
ida
didn't reach the worst case scenario it
was pretty bad million people without
power a lot of flooding to deaths so far
so it's bad
could have been a lot worse
um but cnn is reporting that climate
change is
making storms more frequent
hurricanes are more frequent
because of climate change
all right suppose that's all i told you
cnn is reporting that climate change
makes the storms more frequent
how do you know it's fake news go
tell me how you know that's fake news
just from that one sentence
cnn reports and they show studies and
let's say they they refer to science
they're not just making it up right
they're referring to science
they say that the storms are
more frequent and the climate change is
being
um
used as the explanation
no sources no they do have sources they
have sources
so how do you know it's fake news
i'm going to be real disappointed if you
don't get this
come on i'm looking at all your comments
here here
um and maybe i missed it
somebody's gonna say it
come on
okay you're close complex systems single
variable yeah you're close all right
you're getting you're getting close
it's the dog not barking
it's what they didn't say
all right so here's what they did say
the storms are more frequent
more frequent what's left out
strength of the storm
yes the strength of the storm
is left out
why
do you assume that the strength of the
storm is the same
maybe not right there could be more of
them but less
how about
uh what period of time
are you measuring this storms being more
frequent do you know that is it
is it hundreds of years of storm
reporting
no
because we've only been tracking
hurricanes in a in a useful way since
the 70s
so when we say there are more storms
we're really talking about this tiny
tiny little sliver of history
between the 70s and now
you know in geological terms it's it's
just a
blink of an eye
so could you say
that climate change is the cause
when you're looking at such a
sliver of time feels like anything can
happen in a sliver just by chance right
so that's one thing
and then here's the other thing that's
being left out
come on tell me another gigantic thing
gigantic for understanding the topic
that's left out of the statement that
the storms are more frequent
what is being left out besides the
severity of the storm and the strength
something else is being left out thank
you death count exactly
our ability to mitigate against danger
is really really good now compared to
what it used to be the number of people
who are killed by hurricanes
in the modern times
it's still tragic
but you're talking about a handful
you talk about a handful
of people dying from a hurricane in 20
in you know modern times whereas a
hurricane could you know wipe down a
city
100 years ago
so if you're looking at what is the
problem
well the problem isn't exactly that
there are more frequent storms um
you know you have to you have to put in
all the other variables or else it's
obviously fake news so i'm going to call
it fake news because they leave out the
obvious things you put in it and then
that same story that they linked to as
their source for their claim
they show an animation of what
charleston the city of charleston would
look like under a number of scenarios of
rising sea level
and the rising sea level that they
estimate for charleston
and these are these are not predictions
these are just what if what ifs
so they show you a graphic of what if
the sea level around charleston went up
one foot
and then it shows that areas would be
flooded and it says what if it goes up
two feet
two feet of uh sea level rise
charleston's got much more problems but
what if it's four feet
four feet of uh rise
in charleston's largely underwater
now what's missing from that analysis
what are the odds that the sea level is
going to go up a foot
is anybody predicting the sea level will
go up a foot
i thought that predictions were more
like inches
like two inches is going to be a problem
and you know if it's four inches it's a
big problem but who who's talking about
four feet of serial level rise
i mean that just seems like complete
propaganda to me
i don't even know if anybody's talking
about
that i hope not
all right um
is long covered real or not
believe it or not that's a question
now i think i think everybody agrees
it's real we don't know if it's smallish
or biggish that's the bigger problem
so professor francois balu
tweeted this that there's a preprint
study
do you know what to think about
pre-print studies everybody if i say
there's a pre-print study
how much credibility do you give a
pre-print study
low right so the correct answer is low
so
this is a low
credibility doesn't mean it's wrong
low credibility just means you can't
necessarily
know if it's true
and this says that uh when they measure
they studied a bunch of people in the uk
and found out that almost nobody like a
tiny tiny percentage
might have something that you could call
long covet
now remember the estimates have been as
high as 25 percent
now if long covet is affecting 25
percent that's a big part of your
decision making process
but if it's way less than one percent
maybe not so much so it's a big deal
whether long covet is a is
25 percent of the public or
way less than one percent
but
there's also a sketchiness in the coding
and the data collection so apparently
everybody not everybody but doctors code
different things differently so they
don't necessarily code it as long covet
because they might not know it's long
covered they might just think it's a
second problem
a lot of people probably don't bother
going to the doctor they just feel
shitty for months they don't know why
they just figure it's something else
so we doubt that the data on long covet
is even close to accurate
but to be fair i've told you that the
numbers show it could be as high as 25
percent and now i've told you that it
could be as low as
less than one percent
so i'm just trying to give you the range
of what it might be
and if that changes your
calculation about decision making
maybe you should
maybe you should i would say that it's
starting to affect mine
because the longer we go without really
solid
uh evidence
of long cove being you know a big
problem
the longer we go without that
the less i think it might be
right it's sort of the same same
strategy that on day one you say well
maybe maybe not but the longer you wait
without confirmation
the less likely you'll get confirmation
all right
so i don't know about that
um
uh
you know the united states is being coy
about what we're going to do to rescue
the rest of the americans and our allies
that are trapped in afghanistan
but
do you fault them
for not telling you what we're going to
do about it or being vague about it or
general do you fault the administration
for not being specific
about how we plan to get more americans
out of there i don't
because i think that would be the wrong
thing to be specific
because probably we're going to have to
do some things that even the taliban has
to be flexible about maybe
we might have some
secret threats with the taliban we might
even have a secret deal
it's possible we have a secret deal with
the taliban where
we'll release their funding if all the
americans get down or something like
that
so
i would support the administration's
not being straight with us
on this topic
i do think that for
national security
sometimes
your military leaders have to lie to the
public
would everybody agree that that's an
acceptable lie
if the military genuinely believes that
they can protect the country better
with a temporary lie
do you favor it
i do
but i i could respect an argument that
says you don't
yeah i so
tony blank blinken and biden i'm not
going to get give them a hard time for
acting as though we don't have a plan or
speaking only generically about it like
it's some kind of weak plan because i
imagine a real plan would look like this
tell the americans to get to this
specific place where the taliban doesn't
have any
you know surveillance or air coverage
and we'll drop some helicopters in there
and we'll take you home
so it seems to me like they would have
to keep secret from the taliban and the
rest of the world
some of their plans because some of it
is going to be stuff the taliban doesn't
know we're doing right and other stuff
might be stuff the taliban is working
with us
and we can't exactly say that
right because we might be bribing them
there might be blackmail it could be any
damn thing
so
it's concerning that we do not have a
stated plan for getting everybody out
but i don't know that you'd want it the
other way
all right
um and that
is what i needed to say for today and i
have to go
it has been terrific to see you and
