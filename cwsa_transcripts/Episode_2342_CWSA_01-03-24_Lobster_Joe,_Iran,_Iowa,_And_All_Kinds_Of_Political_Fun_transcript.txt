good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams is the highlight
of human civilization and if you'd like
to take this experience up to levels
where nobody can even understand it with
their tiny human brains all you need is
a copper mro glass a tanker shell suste
a canteen juger flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine here of
the day the thing that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens
now oh God that's good so good I can't
even put it into
words the only word that could describe
how good that sip was is closer to a
moan than a word and it goes like
this yeah
well in uh Entertainment News uh saw
some post by end wokeness one of my
favorite new accounts on X and
apparently the next Star Wars film is
going to be directed by uh feminist
activist and former
journalist from
Pakistan
[Music]
so did you think for a few minutes there
was there a moment when you said to
yourself you you know what I think Bob
Iger the head of Disney I think he gets
it now I think he gets that the wokeness
was hurting his business nope
nope doesn't understand the first thing
about the business he's in charge of
apparently because do you know what I
said when I saw that there would be a
feminist activist who
was was making the new Star
Wars Let let's see if there's anything
if there are any other two things you
can put together that would ruin both
things how
about piss on a
sandwich piss on a
sandwich makes the sandwich Better or
Worse
anybody all right well we'll just use
that analogy so if you want to piss on a
sandwich uh just uh take your beloved
franchise and hand it over to a feminist
activist
because these are woke times and you
just have to you just have to all right
one of the other funny things in uh
entertainment is that Jimmy Kimmel is
super mad that there is a fake news
going about him that alleges incorrectly
there there's no evidence of this
whatsoever incorrectly that he was on
some Epstein flight list now there's no
real evidence of that as far as I can
tell completely made up
however live by the
hoax die by The
hoax honestly if this
didn't make his living telling hoaxes
about Trump this what he does for loving
it's like 30% of his entire Act is Mak
is making believe that that he believes
the hoax is about Trump so somebody put
him on an Epstein
list I don't hate that
honestly if if it happened to a a person
who is trying to be a legitimate you
know good citizen and see things in a
balanced way I would say that's terrible
that's like the worst thing being
smeared by this you know
unfairly but if you make your
living relying on political hoaxes about
Trump do you do you think Jimmy Kimmel
ever said anything about Trump uh
suggesting drinking
bleach do you think that ever came up do
you think Jimmy Kimmel ever believed or
acted like he believed that Trump said
good things about neo-nazis in
Charlottesville oh I'm sure he
did I'm sure he did so I guess if you
live by the hoax you die by The hoax
well Sean hty announces he's moving to
Florida he admits he's a little late on
it but uh says Florida will be his
little Paradise down there we'll have
better taxes and better politicians and
less wokeness and all that
stuff if Florida could just do something
about the
weather then we'd have something then
we'd have something
there yeah the the summer weather winter
weather not
bad all right uh Mickey Mouse as you
know the original Mickey Mouse the 1928
version fell off copyright at the
beginning of this year and and
apparently there according to CBS News
there are already two horror films
planned uh using the original Mickey
Mouse in the horror
film now I thought that was uh
interesting and funny
but didn't you expect it was going to be
a
porn I mean the first one you don't
think it was going to be uh Dicky
Mouse cuz I think the porn industry is
waiting for Dicky Mouse
yeah it's coming he's like Mickey Mouse
just one change there's just one well I
won't say small change but he's called
Dicky
Mouse all right um turns out that uh
many of our elected politicians are
really really good at investing in
stocks whoa they're so good that they're
beating the average by a
lot so I saw a list of all the
politicians who were just just killing
the averages just slaying you know
they're like 50% gains 60%
gains and I said to myself wow I think
there were like 30 people on that list
or something 40 people who had just
killed the
averages so that's all you need to know
right what you need to know is the raw
number of people in Congress who just
killed the average
investing because that tells you
everything you need to know right if you
have the wrong
number what there's something left out
oh the number of people in
Congress yeah what if you knew the total
number of people in Congress and you saw
not just the list of the people who beat
the averages by a
lot what would that look like would it
look like a bell curve of course
it would it would look like most people
have average some people did really
really poorly some people just killed
it did you catch that did you catch that
if they simply told you there are 40 I
don't know what the number was let's say
40 people 40 people who just killed the
average so that tells you something
right that they're all cheating no it
doesn't it
doesn't it just tells you that there are
a lot of people in Congress you could
have taken any group of 500 people
people and you'd find that 40 of them
just killed the average picking stocks
yeah now I want to be really carefully
there am I telling you that there's
nothing to see am I telling you that a
politicians do not do insider trading
it's just chance no no I assume they do
I assume they're
crooked but this doesn't tell you that
don't don't don't piss up my ass and
tell me that I'm drinking lemonade
I I realized I started some kind of a
saying that didn't exist I had to see if
I could fix it halfway through yeah so
now it's the saying don't piss up my ass
and tell me I'm drinking
lemonade you can keep that one you can
keep that one and use it as much as you
like I will not come after you for
plagiarism so you can keep your job as
the president of Harvard if you like
anyway so I do think that the names on
that list uh raise some deep questions
some deep questions I don't like to see
Nancy Pelosi's list on the list of
people who are doing the best
investing even though to be fair is she
not married to somebody who's good at
investing yes but doesn't mean it's all
legitimate
so uh I think two things can be true I
think the information can be biased in
his presentation at the same time it
does seem likely there's some insider
trading doesn't it yeah now yeah right K
Shaw is on the list now here's something
else that you didn't know you ready for
this so how many of you caught this so K
Shaw is on the list of people who did
unusually
well so how many stocks of of his entire
portfolio how many of those stocks
accounted for most of that game do you
know if you don't know you don't know a
 thing let let me defend khaw for
a minute actually K Shaw was nice to me
he had me on his podcast once I I
enjoyed my encounter with him so I have
only only positive vibes so let me say
this as clearly as possible if you take
a large body of people some of those
people are going to buy one stock out of
several that is all their gain it'll
just be one good stock stock that went
up
1,000% now that happened to
me I I had a tremendous gain in stocks
because one stock did really really well
happened to be apple I just happened to
have some Apple stock it beat everything
else I did by a lot was I insider
trading no I just had one good stock now
if you tell me that khaw is in the top
40 investors which by the way is not
that
impressive you out of 500
I mean it's better than average right
it's not it's not like that
impressive is it because every time you
picked a stock it was a winner is that
why he he did so well if that was true
then I've got a real question right if
he picked 10 stocks and eight of them
were just dead bang winners okay I have
lots of questions because that's
statistically pretty
unlikely however if he had 10 ordinary
stocks and one of them just hit gold
that's just an ordinary person investing
that is no indication whatsoever of
insider trading how many of you knew
that how many of you knew that all it
would take is one stock and if you have
500 people and there a lot of them are
investing stock because they're that
they're that level of financial
capability there there should be
statistically and of how many people in
Cong
give me the number of people in congress
senate plus the house 535 right 535 and
of 535 people most of them trading
stocks probably most of them how many of
them would you expect to have at least
one stock that did really
well a few dozen there should be a few
dozen people there who have at least one
stock that did very well now let me let
me ask you this when you look at khaw do
you say to yourself oh he's this
ex-military
guy uh in Congress so how much does he
know he's not very smart so he probably
got lucky is that what you
say didn't he go to
Harvard give give me a fact check K Shaw
went to Harvard didn't
he can you give me a check on
that I I think he went to Harvard and
he's
white you know even harder to get in
so so you've got one person in Congress
who's unusually
smart and did unusually well in stocks
but maybe it was just one stock I don't
know if you tell me it was seven and a
10 killed it then I got
questions but I don't know that I have
no indication of that at
all so let me say again there are two
things that you can hold as true number
one probably there's insider trading do
you know why I say that because probably
it's everywhere probably everywhere that
somebody has inside
information there's a little bit of
insider trading probably almost
everywhere not every person and not
every situation but on average on
average yes of course there is but that
doesn't mean that the people on that
list who did well are insider
trading right you have to get that part
they are unusually well
informed but a lot of what they know is
is also public it's just not super
public you only have to be a little bit
public to be legal it just has to be in
one publication anywhere and you're
legal I had uh I had some neighbors
years ago where they both got accused of
insider trading and the husband went to
jail and the wife did not they they
Insider traded on the same
stock but about two weeks
apart when the husband traded it had not
been in any publication when the wife
traded it had been one in one small
publication that nobody read and that
was enough to go free so she went free
and he went to jail because she waited
two weeks to buy her stock
that's all it took yeah it's very it's a
very fine line between insider trading
and well the public could have known it
so keep that in mind when you look at
that insider trading list there's
probably some crooks on there but not
all of them in all likelihood even if
most of them are
Crooks you know I'd expect 20% of them
just had a good
day all right um Jordan Peterson said
something that just made me think for a
long time so he said this on the
xplatform with no other explanation so
it's just this one
sentence so Dr Jordan Peterson says it's
very hard to find your own
words and you don't actually exist until
you have your own
words
wow did did that have the same impact on
you as that on me now I think this is
more impactful because of the
AI now that we know that something like
intelligence can be created by nothing
but patterns and frequencies of words
and you can reproduce something like
intelligence well in that case it makes
um copied words look not as special so
for example um AI can only do things
that existed as a an existing
combination of words AI does does not
come up with his own new patterns he
uses existing
patterns if you were like that as well
if you're a human being who goes through
life using only the existing patterns
meaning the narrative that your news
sources give you are you really
alive yeah are you really like a human
with uh agency and something that you
think is Free Will and or or are you
just sort of the Driftwood that's
floating down the river and you're just
going with the
flow yeah so so when I uh reposted this
I I did say that's how you can spot an
NPC the NPC is the non-player characters
if we're a simulation which I assume we
are a
reality um do you notice that their
words the exact words the even the form
of the words in the sentence are clearly
assigned to them by new sources and you
can see it clearly you know you can put
on X any day of the week just go to a
couple of posts about politics and
you'll see the exact wording that was on
Fox news or the exact wording that was
on
CNN and if you don't see anything but
that those are you know at least people
who act like
NPCs but if you
if you look at a post by Jordan Peterson
you'll read s stuff like it's very hard
to find your own words and you don't
actually exist until you have your own
words okay who said that
before nobody right that that sounds
like something I've literally never
heard
before so he exists yeah Jordan Peterson
is leaving his mark on civilization
because every time he opens his mouth
it's a combination of words that you
didn't hear before before he
exists so make sure you
exist so Rays uh looks like he's looking
at uh potential of 6 months in prison
for January 6 being in I don't know what
they call them pleading guilty to being
a some misdemeanor charge of I don't
know what uh what are they charging him
with the headline doesn't even say so it
doesn't even matter anymore what the
charge is all right but anyway so we'll
see but if Rays gets jail time are you
going to believe he
was uh an inside source will you believe
that he was an FBI person if he goes to
jail yes you're going to believe he was
in the FBI if he goes to
jail
seriously man you're tough you're a
tough
audience
now is that because you think he won't
go to jail and and he'll just look like
he's going to jail but he won't really
go to jail and S a cover up somebody
says it's an OP what what if they say he
went to jail but there's no record of
him going to jail and he just sort of
disappears for six
months so we're so suspicious that we
don't even think he would go to real
jail he would go to like fake
jail you know and then act like he went
to jail or something
I don't
know I I don't I don't think it feels
like an
OP because it would be too obvious to
catch it like if he doesn't really go to
jail I feel like that would be something
we'd pick up on eventually that doesn't
feel like a good
op so it here here's how a good op could
be it would be a good op if they find
him
guilty but he suspend suspiciously got
no jail
time that would feel a little
suspicious but still that wouldn't feel
like an optimy it would depend if his
sentence was equivalent to other people
or not if it wasn't equivalent then I'd
say I have
questions I don't know now you will
remember I hope you'll remember that I
have defended
Rays does everybody remember that when
everybody was saying saying he's an
undercover I said anything's possible I
never ruled it out so I've never ruled
out that he could be undercover but I've
told you a million
times he's a
citizen he's a Citizen First and that
means he's innocent till proven guilty
now if it turns out that he's proven
guilty for these crimes I probably think
he should be
pardoned I think he should be pardoned
with the others but it's starting to
look starting to look like he might
actually just be a
citizen maybe right so I'm going to I'm
going to double down on innocent till
proven
guilty but I share your
suspicions is that fair can I share your
suspicion while still saying my standard
which I will not I will not
wiggle is completely 100% innocent until
the courts proen guilty they're going to
have to prove it and then I still want
him even if they prove it I still want
him pardoned because he's a
citizen all right um excess mortality
let's talk about that uh you know Joe
Rogan made some news talking about that
with the guest and there are claims that
there's excess mortality just all over
the place you've all heard of them right
claims there just excess mortality all
over the place here's a question that I
just want to put in there not because I
know what's true CU I don't so don't
take this as me telling you what is true
I really don't
know I'm going to tell you how to think
about it in other words what model to
use your head to decide what's true
you're going to have to decide on your
own what's true here's the model you
should
consider everything we heard about the
vaccinations was
agree what we heard about the the
vaccinations was largely we all
know that now
what we heard about the virus
itself from its source to its deadliness
was you agree everything about
the vaccination was everything
we heard about the Corona virus was
 now there were true things
within those stories I shouldn't say
everything that's a little bit of an
overstatement but there was so much that
was about the vaccinations and
also about the virus itself right very
much a now we have this uh new
data that says that there's excess
mortality so let me let me check where
your think he is you understand that the
the vaccination data was you
understand the co data was but
you
believe the excess mortality
data how many of you are there how many
of you would describe yourself as
somebody who disbelieved vaccination
data disbelieved Corona virus data but
now do accept fully accept that the
excess uh death data is correct how many
of you will many people are admitting
that now even though you admit it does
it feel logical to you even though you
feel it that's that's your opinion but
even your own opinion does it feel
logical to you do do you feel that the
data on excess mortality has a special
quality to it that makes it reliable
when every country and every
professional lied to your face
for months about both the virus and the
vaccination so you've seen that entire
countries and all the officials in all
the countries can tell you the same lie
at the same time you saw yourself we all
live through it why would you believe
the mortality
numbers because they're not
motivated is that why uh do you believe
it because insurance companies are
telling you and they're the ones who
have to get it right how many would how
many take that position there when the
insurance companies tell you there's a
problem now you know for
sure
anybody good see see now you're thinking
because the insurance companies they
have to get the right
number sorry sorry you did it
again and so did I many many of you are
making The Logical mistake that I made
until just recently it it took me a
while to correct my own
thinking the insurance companies make
more money if they can convince you
mortality is
higher let me say it again follow the
money you believe that you believe that
fora lied to you so they can make money
on the
vaccinations you you believe that
everybody lied to you about Co partly so
big Firma could make money on
vaccinations so you believe that data is
unreliable Whenever there The Entity
that controls the data can make more
money by lying to you than telling you
the
truth so now you've got a new situation
in which the insurance companies have a
gigantic Financial benefit from lying to
you and telling you that there's excess
mortality and my God you're going to
have to pay more for your insurance
because of all that excess mortality
like people droing dead we don't even
know why so your rates are going to go
up 20% for all the excess
mortality all right now I would like to
see
confessions I I'm taking confessions how
many of you will now confess that if you
believed motivated numbers from
insurance people that you feel stupid
now anybody does anybody feel stupid
because I do I mean I feel
stupid that I ever believe the insurance
numbers I feel stupid because it's the
most obvious lie the most obvious lie is
the people who have the most financial
advantage now again let me be very clear
because of course this will be taken out
of context someday so this will be the
part they cut
out I don't know if there's access
mortality how would I know the only
thing I know is that the people who have
the greatest incentive to lie to you say
there
is that's what I
know now there's another standard I use
to determine uh
 I call it the filter
and it goes like this if science is
making a certain claim and let's call
this a science claim even though it's
coming from insurance companies if
science is making a certain
claim uh and you want to find out if
it's true but you're not so good at
evaluating science one of the things I
look at is to see if it looks like it's
true in your real life I always use this
example science says that smoking
cigarettes gives you lung cancer and
sure enough I know real people in the
real world who smoked and had lung
cancer and I know only one person who
ever didn't smoke and also got lung
cancer so I'd say okay well at least
that's consistent that means
something right um science told you at
one time that uh you could get AIDS from
giving a
 probably true but I've never
heard of it never heard of it once not a
single time in theory it can happen but
I've never heard of it so I've got some
questions about that one doesn't mean
it's not true and I'm certainly not
giving you any medical information don't
you know if you have a choice don't blow
anybody who has AIDS it's probably a bad
idea but that's an example where the
science and my observation they don't
line up so I would at least have a
question about that one but I would play
as safe and you know stay away from
Risky
Behavior now let's take the uh excess
mortality in my own
life uh two people died this this past
year who were in my opinion
way too
young how many of you had that
experience in the past year that
somebody in your life died who was not
in the was not yet a senior citizen or
old
enough yeah every one of you saw it
right it does feel like there's some
excess
mortality but if you believe it because
the insurance company said so just know
that that's not the source you should be
looking
for yeah
so I I don't know I mean I I am
concerned that excess mortality is
exactly what it looks like which is too
much I just don't know why and of course
the vaccinations would be on the short
list of things you'd wonder
about all right
uh let's talk about our diversity hires
so the White House Press Secretary says
quote it is shameful to send uh illegal
aliens to Sanctuary
cities wait a
minute if you were describing to me two
plans which one would I say was shameful
plan number one keep illegal immigrants
in a place that is not a sanctuary City
or number two ship them to a place that
has actually changed their laws to be
welcoming which of those is the shameful
one go to the place that's
welcoming stay in the place that's very
much not
welcoming and our diversity hire press
secretary and by the way we can say that
now out loud I love the fact that I can
just say out loud it's obvious she's a
diversity hire because she's not
qualified and everybody can see it I
mean there's nobody I don't think
anybody is less qualified for their job
than Karen John pier and she does it
right in front of you every day and you
don't have to be an expert right if a
lawyer does a bad job I'm not sure I
could tell the
difference but if somebody talking does
a bad job oh I could tell the
difference I could tell that she's one
of the worst talkers I've ever
seen uh so yeah that's obviously a
diversity hire and a good she she acts
as a beacon
of everything that Republicans have been
trying to say everything that VES say I
mean I think Karine jeanpierre could be
the logo for fake ramas Swami's entire
campaign
literally this is what you get Karine
John Pier this is what you get with
Democrat
policies do you want more of
that that would be pretty strong just
use her use her as the logo it would be
called racism of course because that's
all they
have
um all right uh the big news yesterday
was that the president of Harvard
Claudine gay resigned which is a big
victory for some people pushing for it
Bill akman uh big investor bill akman
was pushing really hard um and oh my god
did he push hard and also Christopher
rufo um political activist I think You'
call them pushes against the Dei and ESG
stuff and they're they're both taking uh
I guess their Victory laps but Bill
lman is taking more than a Victory
lap he's taking a uh a shame
laap which is interesting because Bill
Amman
won and he's taking a self flag gelation
shame lap what's that all about you ask
well I'll tell you so Bill Blackman Hero
of the Day um you one of the architects
of forcing Harvard to at least uh fire
their president although she'll stay on
as a professor we believe a well-paid
professor um but he wrote a very long
post that I just saw before I came on
explaining that he had not fully
understood the damage of
Dei so he was basically saying oops how
did I not know how bad this was and then
he goes on to explain how bad it is now
that he
knows um I'll tell you the the value
that bill Amman is providing to the
public conversation is just tremendous
and I think it's even
stronger by the fact that he's telling
you in public that he was blindsided by
it and it could sort of snuck up on him
that that increases his credibility
because when you say you're wrong about
something that makes it far more
credible when you say and here's why
I've changed my mind and that's a very
strong persuasion so yeah credibility is
high uh Victory is high great year for
Bill lman and Christopher rufo Standing
Ovation Christopher rufo you are doing a
really good work in a lot of places
getting rid of ESG and Dei especially in
colleges all
right how did the AP report this
story um the headline was Harvard
president's resignation highlights new
conservative weapon against colleges
meaning the
plagiarism yeah so that's the big story
is that the the terrible people who are
conservatives uh they got this new
weapon for getting rid of all these
awesome uh people of color and diverse
people yeah that's that's the Highlight
there it's not about destroying Harvard
the most respected Institution in
America it wasn't about that it was
about this new terrible weapon uh which
is going to enforce honesty on
academics whoa terrible and it gets
worse um there's a mention that
Christopher rufo said he uh he got a
scalp a quote scalp he actually
misspelled it in his post but he did he
meant scalp
um and the AP me describes that as a
practice taken up by white colonists who
sought to eradicate Native
Americans interesting so when I was a
child I I guess I learned the wrong
history I learned that it was the Native
Americans who had come up with the the
scalping idea I do believe that the the
white colonist did also pick up the
technique so I think that's true but I'm
not sure I would have framed it that
way as scalping be one of those uh White
colonist things did and those colonizers
and they
scalping if there's one thing I hate
it's all the scalping done by the
colonizers am I
right so that's how the world is
reacting
um yeah and uh I was looking at Colin
Wright post and he was talking about
what could be achieved now that we don't
have um
filtering and suppression of social
media so the firing of Claud and gay was
entirely a social media phenomenon I
think you'd agree it wasn't the press
the Press did not get this done I mean
they were part of the process but they
didn't get it done this this was
entirely
X without the X platform none of this
happens so Elon
Musk can be said now to have done a
concrete absolutely use ful productive
moves the ball forward
Thing by owning X and making it free
speech actual good things happen in the
real world and now you can you can trace
that sequence of events very clearly but
I would say that the uh the uh let's say
opposing
forces like ax are is more than that you
know Steven Miller has this American
first legal um group they raise funds to
do law fair against uh Democrats because
Democrats use law fair against
Republicans so it's a counter Force so
if you add the fact that there's now
free speech on
X and Steven Miller's group now can
counter the lawfare or at least to have
a you know equivalent power it's a real
different year looks really different
doesn't it and some of the uh lesser
Publications starting to go out business
and and I like the fact that the big
Publications are now
completely uh smeared and
shamed you know anybody who uses social
media should know that the Washington
Post for example is not real news they
didn't know that a few years
ago uh let's see what else the other
thing that uh conservatives have going
for them is powerful
influencers now Bill Amman is not a
conservative I believe he does not
identify that way and I agree with him I
don't don't think he does but he's just
one of the people who noticed things
went too far you know if you're anywhere
in the middle and he's probably
somewhere in the middle things are crazy
right so the fact that there are
powerful
voices who are not taking a paycheck
from a
boss who are starting to shape the uh
understanding of the world that's new
that's new so people like me who already
got cancelled people like Tucker who who
no longer has a boss uh and you could
name you know 10 others there there are
a lot of people now who don't have
bosses and that's different and they're
influential and they have very large
accounts on X so that's a counter force
that started growing in 2015 when Trump
came on board there were a lot of these
you know pirate voices like mine that
just came out of nowhere but we weren't
that
powerful now I think a lot of us you
know when when Trump got elected my
account on what was Twitter
was does anybody remember maybe a
100,000 at the time Trump got elected
started at 5,000 for a long time now
it's over a million so it's like 1.1
million so my influence
is 10 times what it was in
2016 and that would be true for a lot of
people in my position probably 10 times
T about Tucker's power Tucker's power at
least double you know you could argue 10
times because of
viewership so that'll be interesting um
John Arnold does a post talking about
ESG says the Arc of ESG As Told through
oil and gas quarterly investor president
presentations so before 2020 uh ESG was
not
mentioned but then between 2020 and
2022 uh the oil and gas people dedicated
slide among the first 10 pages of the
deck so it was in the first 10 pages of
their presentations in
2023 it's mentioned in the B back half
of the presentation so you can see the
corporations trying to uh put the cat on
the roof it's like oh yeah yeah ESG
still our top priority well it's not in
the first slide it's not the first slide
but we've got it in there well it's not
in the first half but it's totally in
there let's say sort of in the back
half we're not going to talk about it a
lot but it's totally there high priority
that we're not talking about so much
because it's embarrassing
now uh um but as Russ green points out
also on X he thinks ESG will Trend up
again now that uh Canada the EU and us
the financial Regulators will be pushing
it so as the corporations are trying to
distance themselves from it the
governments are trying to embrace it
harder so now the corporations and the
governments are going to be not yet but
might be a little bit at odds on
ESG um I've noticed that well I was
looking at a story about China's uh
economy being
weak jeopardizing president G's you know
vision for the country Etc and I was
thinking that 2024 is looking pretty lit
so
far it feels like everything's going my
way except um ticktock and
fenel tiktock and fenel did not go my
way there's more fenel and there's more
Tik Tock since I told you I was going to
destroy both of
them I'm not done I'm not a quitter I am
going to destroy Tik Tock and I am going
to destroy fentel or I'm going to be one
one of the people working on it so
uh double
down uh let's see Bob Menendez and
Congress got some more charges against
him for trying to set up a buddy with h
the cutter royal family and I guess he
got some gold bars for that they allege
you got you got at least two gold bars
for 100,000 now that's in addition
that's in addition to the other gold
bars he allegedly got for some Egypt
business
now Matt Mullen wag spoke out against
Tik Tock influence on the Tim Ferris
podcast Matt's a good guy
uh use a f
WordPress anyway
um yeah everything's going my way
well did you see the photos of Joe Biden
coming back from his long weekend I
guess he must have fallen asleep in the
Sun and he's uh severely sunburned his
face looks like a
lobster
so um
I think he's decided to become a person
of color and he's just going to do it
the hard
way now here's a question I ask
you um you think it was a
facelift some of you say you think it
was a chemical appeal his hands looked
red too did you see his hands do you
think he did his hands as well as his
face CU his hands look pretty
red interesting all right
well if it's a
sunburn I was going to say it was a slow
motion
assassination they're like Hey Joe feel
like taking a nap well yes I do how
would you like to take a nap on the
beach I'd love it do you have some
sunscreen oh you're not going to need
any sunscreen unless you fall
asleep so just don't fall asleep all
right good plan goes down the Beach
falls
asleep nearly
dies yeah I think they were trying to uh
they were trying to assassinate
him very
slowly yeah that's one
possibility the other possibility is
that red is the new
orange red is the new
orange
anybody yeah because orange is doing so
well in the poles he realized he needed
a color cuz he he was running against a
person of
color
orange so he needed to become a person
of color maybe
um I have more jokes by the way I have
more dad jokes are you here for him
who's here for the dad jokes well you're
going to hear him anyway uh you know
it's not the first time that Joe Biden
has been embarrassed by a
son it's not the first time he's
embarrassed Ed
by a
sun see here it's funnier if you think
it's a sunburn I don't know if it is but
if it is it's
funnier uh do you know the football team
the Washington
commanders yeah they asked Biden to be
their new
mascot Elizabeth Warren
mostard okay I got another
one uh another 20 minutes of son and he
could have been the president of
Harvard anybody another 20 minutes a son
could have been the president of
Harvard he's already got the
plagiarism he's already got the
plagiarism I know that's not bad how
about uh let's
see um I saw a post from maiz ma
Moore who said that about Joe that uh
um maybe his approval rating was so
low that now he wanted to
be uh
peeling he wanted to be uh
peeling so now he is yeah okay um but to
me uh being in the sun and uh getting so
badly burned it looks like a
Lobster is
shellfish it's
shellfish yeah no all right that's all I
got that's all I
got all right so the news says that uh
Biden is going to give a big speech on
January 6 of course uh in which he'll be
painting Trump as an
insurrectionist because uh that's all
they got uh it's going to mark three
years since the capitol
Riot uh and he's going to do his speech
at Valley Forge where George Washington
stage American
troops uh to which I
say Joe Biden get in that narrow Ravine
will you hey here's a narrow Ravine why
don't you get right in
there because there is nothing that
makes him more vulnerable than claiming
this was an Insurrection because unlike
other
oxes the mockery cannons work best for
those accused usually the mockery is on
the side of the accuser like oh ho ho
you you say drinking bleach oh you and
it's hard to it's hard to defend
yourself when you're being mocked right
you can't mock back it just feels like
too little too
late but when they go after Trump for an
Insurrection which is the most
ridiculous claim of all hoaxes like you
don't really have to even know much
about the news if the only thing you
knew is that the Republicans were
unarmed you'd already know everything
you need to
know so the fact that uh we can mock
this end of existence I want I want to
make sure that the Biden is completely
committed to it though because you want
the mocking to happen like over the
summer you don't want to mock too soon
so ideally you want the Democrats to
think this is working to fully commit to
the to the Insurrection narrative as
their main thing and then you just
destroy it over the summer now the way
to destroy it is with mockery as I said
and and if anybody says to you that
Republicans were trying to take over the
country ask them to describe how that
would work all right all
right put the uh you know connect the
dots now they've got the Lector all
right so they they've captured the
Lecter now connect the dots to their
control of the nuclear
Triad like what's the series of events
between capturing the
Lecter and of course the sauntering it
wasn't all about the Lecter there was
also some suering so but just connect
the dots I know you've got a good
argument but I'm not seeing it yet I
know it's good one but connect the dots
how do they go from the lectron and the
sauntering to control of the nuclear Tri
had what connect those dots for me yeah
so it's going to be
fun so they're walking into Trump's
narrow Ravine and he'll be uh taking
care of that later I'm
sure um Michael smires did a poll not a
scientific poll but a poll of uh
audience I guess or people watch CNN or
something like that and 68% of them
23,000 voters uh say that keeping Trump
off the ballot would help
democracy let me say that
again 2third of the people the CNN
pulled meaning CNN viewers or people who
were friendly with CNN to answer their
poll two-thirds of
them think that keeping the leading
candidate the one who's leading in the
polls keeping him off the ballot
helps
democracy
now uh what is it what does that show
you I don't know how maranes is going to
spin this when he talks about it he's
teasing that he's going to be talking
about this today I think
but doesn't that tell you the CNN
viewers are
idiots how what else could you possibly
conclude other than the viewership of
CNN are idiots and that the CNN uh
content made them
so I don't know another way to interpret
that so that's
interesting uh and now now Biden and the
White House are going to blame
Republicans for the uh situation at the
border don't you love that the democ
rats are going to blame the Republicans
for not having better uh border
situation right here's their argument
now by the way their argument is not
terrible they actually have an
argument I don't buy it and I'll tell
you why but it's actually a better
argument than you'd think and it goes
like
this um the the GOP rejected Biden's
supplemental funding that would have
helped at the border now appar that's
true that the GOP did reject his border
funding and what it would have done it
would have hired new border
agents don't you want that that sounds
like that would be good um more Asylum
officers and immigration judges as well
as technology to combat the flow of
fenel well I want to combat the flow of
fentel and if they have some technology
that didn't get funded to do
that it seems like a problem but did you
catch the part about the Asylum officers
and immigration
judges no the problem is the Asylum
law the the problem the problem is not
how do you handle more Asylum people I'm
pretty sure that if you had more Asylum
officers and immigration judges
especially the Asylum officers wouldn't
you have more
immigrants if you had more if you had
more effective processing to let people
in because Asylum is not about keeping
people out Asylum is designed to let
them in so if you hire more people to
process people who want to come in and
stay isn't that making it worse but
because most people would not understand
that Nuance it would look like the
Republicans failed to fund something
that would have stopped immigration if
you didn't know that Asylum actually
creates more of it not less of it
so
yeah uh meanwhile uh the IDF probably I
don't think they're taking credit for it
but uh top Hamas founder was
assassinated in
Beirut which is interesting because it's
Beirut and it is not Gaza so they they
took out somebody did let's say IDF
probably took out uh Hamas leader
assassinated him I think there might
have been another one there there's some
claims that there were no innocent
civilians killed does that sound
likely a big missile attack and no
civilians
killed I don't believe that
um yeah and it was a was a bad day for
Hamas because they lost president CLA
and gay as well as this Hamas
leader just kidding just
kidding uh
but here's what I ask because obviously
there will be more Hamas leaders in
other countries they're going to be
killed uh Israel is pretty clear about
the fact that they're going to hunt down
and kill all the leadership of Hamas I
wouldn't I wouldn't bet against it
that's for sure
but if you knew that you were standing
near a leader of Hamas wouldn't you try
to put some
distance like it would be terribly
unfair if somebody were let's say you
know a server and was just serving him
at dinner and didn't know that he might
be the subject of a missile attack at
any moment so I would say learn where
who your Hamas leaders are and stay away
from um there were two big blasts in
Iran which is scary that killed over uh
100 people and wounded 100 killed over
100 people and this blast was at a
an event commemorating the slain General
Solomon a that Trump had
killed now who exactly would have done
this and it's been called a terrorist
attack and I think they're blaming some
Sunni
extremists because they're
shites now does that sound right to you
do you think that the sunnis would
Target
Sal's f
funeral I don't know
maybe
maybe but I I think there's a lot more
to find out about this I don't think it
sounds like a Israel it doesn't feel
like an Israel operation I'm pretty sure
Israel is not blowing up crowds of
mourners that would be you know not
their style but also wouldn't be
effective and they would know it so so
it's got to be some kind of terrorist
doesn't make sense to be anything
else all right
um the vake RAS Swami got a big
endorsement from former Iowa
Representative Steve
king um who of course the mainstream
press says he's a uh provocative person
because he once questioned why quote
white nationalist was offensive I think
that's what cost him his job he
questioned why the the phrase white
nationalist was
offensive because why can't you be white
and also a
nationalist so I think that's where he
was going it was not good politics
because he should have known that was
you know a third rail and obviously that
was going to go
wrong however I wonder if that would
look the same if it happened
today if you were on the xplatform I
wonder if he would have been you know if
x had its free speech I wonder if he
would have been
protected meaning that conservatives
might have rallied around and said look
there's nothing wrong with white
nationalists if that's what they believe
I think it's a terrible term because it
just invites
criticism so if you're trying to say it
should be okay to be white and it should
be okay to be a nationalist I think
that's a better way to go because I'm
pretty sure that Steve King if you asked
him would be very much in favor of uh
Asian-American nationalists and black
nationalists black American nationalists
I think he just like
nationalists but he didn't think that it
should be wrong if you're white at the
same time so he did a terrible job of
explaining and and I think he liked you
know what he would consider maybe the
you know the classic Europe European
culture or something like that separate
argument but he did a terrible job of
explaining his position but uh uh I I
wonder if that'll help vake it might
don't
know anyway uh the Iowa debates are
going to be limited to I guess because
of the new rules you have to have at
least
10% uh the only invitees would be Trump
who won't go because he's he'd be crazy
to debate he has such a lead uh so it'll
be just D santis and Haley meanwhile
Trump will probably do something on Fox
News town hall and vake will do
something on Tim pool
show all right what are you gonna watch
are you gonna watch uh danus and haly or
uh Trump's town hall on Fox or V on Tim
pool go who are you going to
watch I'm seeing lots of of timcast Bo
Tim pool's looking
strong a lot of v i see more interest in
V than the others I see a lot of
trump yeah I don't have any interest at
all in D santis versus
Hy like I'll watch the Highlight Clips
if there are any but I feel like that's
going to be so milk toast and they'll
just I don't know it feels like a lot of
nothing
so to me it's between Trump well I don't
know that Trump is going to make any
news do you suspect that Trump will say
something that will change your mind
about Trump or anything else I mean
he'll be interesting I'll definitely
watch the highlights yeah but V on Tim
pool are they going to turn on the uh
debate and then mock the debate in real
time because I would watch
that I'd watch watch the hell out of
that they're not going to they're not
going to talk about the debate in real
time I hope they are if it if they're
doing it at the same time they should
talk about it all right well I don't
know the answer to that question but I
will tell you that the Von Tim pool
sounds like a really good show that
sounds like a good show all right uh so
vake has done the double
grassly uh I guess Chuck Grassley was
famous for uh campaigning in all 99
precincts in Iowa and V has done all
99
twice nobody's ever done that before now
he still is way behind in the polling
you know way behind Trump as everybody
is but also pretty far behind Haley and
the santis you about half of their
numbers do you think that his extreme ex
retail campaigning in Iowa vaces will
give him a
surprise do you think the polling has
yet um captured that he's visited every
place
twice because I love the fact that he's
visited every place twice because that
sticks in your head like crazy doesn't
it if he said he went every place once I
would have said oh that's nice but you
know I probably could have got away with
uh going to the biggest place places
twice and it' be just as
good so going every place once that's
all right it doesn't blow me
away going to every
Precinct
twice is really impressive and let me
ask you this have you ever seen a clip
of aake looking
tired what the hell is up with that how
and he never looked tired he never looks
tired he he did over 200 uh of these
little appearances in Iowa with these
small audiences in which he talked with
the same energy the same
enthusiasm over 200 times with probably
a very similar
message yeah being 38 helps a lot
doesn't it but I couldn't do that when I
was under 38 yeah so I you know I often
think that you you can't have that level
of accomplishment unless you don't need
the same level of
sleep I I've often thought that might
have been you know Trump's superpower
too just less
sleep he's just got more energy than the
average person
yeah do you remember Trump's superpower
against Jeb Bush
energy so what Trump did was he was
smart enough to know that if you show
the most energy
people respond to that as leadership
energy and Leadership your brain just
thinks they're practically the same
thing so he's so V has created a
narrative of energy a double grassly
that not only has branding it's a double
grassly how awesome is that is as a name
he double grassly the first one ever how
much energy does it take to double
grassly when Iowa isn't even the only
thing that's happening it's not even the
the only thing happening and he's still
double grassl that's a level of energy
that's crazy that's crazy energy right
so I don't know I I I'm not going to
predict I'm not going to go out of my
way and predict you know any outcome in
particular but if you think he can't
surprise you might have a surprise he
might surprise he might surprise CU if
you do that much right and and let me
also say
this name the error that V
made name the error the campaign error
that V
made
nothing
nothing how how in the world did he get
to this
point nothing not a single error of any
consequence the worst thing he did was
keep his microphone on when he took a a
leak and that that just became more
content it just cre created more energy
even that wasn't a
mistake yeah I I don't think that
um I don't think it's possible to fully
appreciate how good he is at
communicating Until you realize he's
gone this far without a
mistake the least one I can think of I
can't think of one right I could if you
say Nikki I can okay I can think of a
mistake yeah she said women are better
than men that's pretty M yeah big
mistake but I can't think of anything
that now no explained his Tik Tock
strategy I would you know my first
choice is everybody to dump on Tik Tok
but he he said
directly I can't believe there's still
people who believe the Soros
connection would you show yourself how
many of you will admit that you're so
underinformative
think a a Soros puppet would say
anything that came out of his mouth
literally everything he says is anti-
Soros everything why would you why would
you believe that because uh the danis
campaign wanted you to believe that I
think that's where it came
from yeah no the the scholarship stories
an the context is of course he
took money why
not who cares about taking money from a
scholarship in high school I took money
for scholarships do you think I cared
about the organization that gave me the
scholarship I did
not yeah do you know who I got a
scholarship from true
story I once got a financial a from the
Betty Crocker
organization Betty Crocker yeah Betty
Crocker had a Homemakers test that you
could take when I was in high school
that's right I said it a Homemakers test
yeah no when I was a kid the Betty
Crocker organization would give you
money for writing an essay that said
whatever they wanted to say about
America or something Betty Crocker right
now I sat for the test and I remember
the teacher saying um what are you doing
here and I said there's a Betty Crocker
Homemaker test and you get money if you
write the best essay so I'm I'm I'm here
for the money
and they said you know it's uh mostly
for the girls right I know but there's
no law against me being a homemaker so
I'm going to take the Betty Crocker
Homemaker test and they said well okay I
I guess you can take the test you know
or you could do the
essay now what they didn't count on is I
won I won the essay I wrote the best
essay so I actually won the Betty
Crocker Homemaker
award I did got the Betty Crocker
Homemaker
award why was I even talking about
that what what point was I making before
I started talking about that oh Soros
right now Betty Crocker makes a cake
right what do what do you think is my
opinion of people who sell sugar to
people as food what what do you think I
think of any company that is selling you
sugar and calling your
food yeah terrible terrible terrible
terrible terrible company now ask me how
I felt about taking their
money pretty good pretty good you know I
even felt better because it was a sexist
and exclusionary process that I went in
and just up because I could that
was part of
it by the
way do do you want an answer to the
question Scott were you always like
this now you know yeah I was always like
this yeah I've never taken from
anybody at any age not
once
I'll give you another example you want
to hear another example when I was in
sixth grade I
think um our class was bad and the
teacher decided that we were all so bad
that the entire class would have to sit
for
detention without regard to whether any
individual did anything wrong now I was
in the class and I was quite certain
that I had not participated in any of
the things that were problems
so the entire class went to sit for
detention and I just went out and played
outside and then was done my teacher
said hey you're supposed to be in
detention and I said for what I didn't
do anything and they said but I know but
you're supposed to be in detention and
then I gave them a little speech about
Collective
punishment do you know what happened to
me
my teacher said you know I don't think
we want to with this let's just
move
on true
story I I rejected their Collective
punishment and was willing to take it to
the mat I don't know how hard I don't
don't know how far they were willing to
take that issue but I was willing to
take it all the
way I have more stor like
that yes I've always been this way I was
born this way so that ladies and
gentlemen is all I've got for you today
um thanks for joining on YouTube you're
all awesome I'll see you tomorrow same
