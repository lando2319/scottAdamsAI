good morning and welcome
to the best day of 2023 so far and also
a highlight of civilization you made it
to coffee with Scott Adams and that
means you're the kind of person
who can really put it together if you
know what I mean
so good for you
and uh amazingly we have hundreds of
people who have already awakened early
enough now how would you like to take
this experience up to a new level higher
than already
oh yeah all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
jealous of style and a canteen Joker
flask of vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
you think that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
sip and it happens now go
I will stipulate that that is the best
SIP of the year that's what
well I don't know about you but how was
your New Year's Eve celebration
uh me I haven't had human contact in two
days
which was not what I planned at all
I I actually
plan something very expensive last night
but the Bay Area was underwater so there
was no traveling
so I got to spend a lot of money but I
did not have any human contact I
couldn't leave the house yesterday
so it was expensive
and so far a complete zero
now have I told you about my uh one of
my evidence that I'm in a simulation
is that my problems follow a specific
theme and I have lots of problems within
my theme but I don't have many problems
outside of the theme even when other
people do I don't know why
my theme as I've told you is water
problems
plumbing and water problems
going into 2023 I've got a broken hot
water dispenser
that gives me dirty water for some
reason I've got
sync that doesn't work it's linking two
showers that are broken
I've got water coming through the
ceiling
and much of my landscape is in the road
in front of my house
let me tell you what my gardener
needs to add to his talent stack I
really like my gardener and he helped
build a water sort of an emergency water
Channel because my my property collects
a lot of water and I can you know I'll
drown the neighbors if I don't manage it
so I had to put in a very expensive you
know new separate outdoor drainage
system they have some decorative rocks
that if it in the event of too much
water it would enter this new channel
and go into this Like a Rock Creek there
was just rocks waiting and then I would
go down and harmlessly into the street
well it looked really good so my
Gardener has a A plus for aesthetic
sense I really liked it did a good job
look look like it belonged there
here's here's what my Gardener did not
do
he did not do a water flow calculation
which takes into consideration the mass
of each of the rocks
and uh their their buoyancy
so many of the uh fisticized and smaller
rocks that made up my drainage niche are
now visiting my neighbors
because I'm at the top of a hill and
there was just enough water to carry the
Rocks all the way down the hill and
around to the neighborhood
so yesterday
I spent much of my day
cleaning up rocks from my neighbors in
front of my neighbor's homes
and uh
but on the good side
it did drain just about where it was
supposed to
it's just that whole Rock buoyancy thing
we didn't get we didn't get right so I'm
going to recommend my Gardener that he
sign up for a class in physics
fluid dynamics
um
and then maybe take another run at it
something like that
all right so I'm sure that'll work out
um San Francisco was so wildly wet some
kind of record rainfall that the the the
sewers
were getting so much pressure from all
the water that it was starting to shoot
out so there's all these videos this
morning
let's see
it
it's just like shooting out there
now it's not just in one place either
apparently there are a number of places
where it was doing that now to me it
looked like a portal from hell
so
it was reported as a you know like a
weather related phenomenon but
I'm pretty sure those are demons
and the demons are made entirely of
feces and Fentanyl
so San Francisco
figured out a way
and I think they have to think pretty
hard they thought huh
we've created a dystopian hellscape
but is there any way we can take that up
a level
is there any way to top it in 2023 and
then they did they did they managed to
aerosol the problems that they had uh
already so now they're they're shooting
the fecal matter and the fentanyl up
into the air
so now that it's aerosol
that should work out fine uh on Twitter
today somebody said
is it really that bad in San Francisco
or is this all hyperbole
to which I said how the hell would I
know I live an hour from San Francisco
and you couldn't drag me there with a
with a bulldozer
there's literally nothing you could do
that would get me into San Francisco
like I I'm gonna wait until it's not a
dystopian hellscape and then maybe visit
and then maybe visit
that's my plan
how many of you saw the
the bully slapping video that I tweeted
yesterday
it's getting a lot of views so I think
it was in Germany there were some school
kids
and the setup was
um I'm guessing the ages but approximate
Ages were some boys maybe 14 years old
I'm guessing sitting on a bench in some
kind of school setting outside and there
was a young girl who maybe was 16 she
was bigger bigger than the boys on the
bench
um and she was sort of getting in the
face of one of them who was you know
completely backed up and then she
started to say something that was
physically threatening so you can see he
was putting his arms up because he
thought she was going to hit him
somebody translated it and said
something like I'm not going to hit you
you know he was trying to avoid it a
fight
so
the girl keeps berating him and berating
him and finally she just leans up leans
in and just smacks him
so boys 14.
sort of a normal looking 14 year old boy
she's 16 but definitely bigger
how do you think that worked out for her
it didn't work out
so he stood up slapped the piss out of
her
and then you know she immediately
recoiled in pain and horror but then he
starts to walk away
having matched I exactly matched her
violence you know he didn't didn't
exceed it he just matched it and then he
walked away
and then she went after him again
this time it didn't go so well
yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna glorify
the violence because we don't support
violence right nobody's promoting
violence
the larger story here
is the reaction to the video
right the the video itself is you know
two people have a situation that doesn't
really go beyond that
but how we reacted to it really was
interesting
really interesting because there's a
whole male female thing happening at
least in America that is is a
checking the boundaries of things right
right that has a has the power structure
changed you know so a lot of people were
seeing more in this little story
than really what it was about it was
about two people basically but we
automatically you know put that into our
model of the world
now at the same time just for context I
tweeted a great thread
on
um all the anti-white male
discrimination that's now in my in my
word institutionalized
so Aaron siberium goes through all the
examples from the past year or so of
direct government discrimination against
white males and when I say Direct
I mean they actually say it
we're going to give these benefits or or
even coveted shots or Cova treatment or
even hospitalization we're going to give
it to these races
and we're going to give less of it to
white people now I'm saying white males
because you know the gender thing is in
here but not in that example
so uh when you see the number of uh
let's say medical and also a college and
school related things that are clearly
designed
to minimize
the the advantages I guess of being
white and male and to boost other groups
now
this is all sort of the backdrop
so when a bunch of white men see a tweet
of a a young white male slapping the
crap out of a bully
it really hits you
someplace you wanted to be hit
and this isn't good
just look how bad it is
that a whole bunch of white men mostly
white I mean not all obviously it was
you know my my Twitter feed is a mixture
of people but just think about the fact
that a whole bunch of white men looked
at that video and said yeah kick the
 out of that woman she had it coming
now I'm not arguing whether she had it
coming we're not promoting violence I'm
just saying we've actually got to the
point
where white men are celebrating violence
against women
and by the way that's why Andrew Tate is
so popular
nobody says it out loud
but white men and men are
feeling so abused lately that when
somebody goes in public and says
it's okay to hit women again I'm not
promoting that you know we don't like
any violence but things have gone so far
that young men are saying yeah I'm down
to that
let's hit women because I'm I'm tired of
the way things are going again just to
be as clear as possible not promoting it
not condoning it not celebrating it we
don't do that but but I'm observing I'm
observing
and what I observe is kind of scary
because there's one thing that you don't
want it to happen
is to push white men too far
I don't think it's going to happen
because we're pretty good at bending
but you don't want to push them too far
because like the woman who slapped the
boy
I believe that there's a completely
misleading understanding of how much
power is on the other side
that's being held back
you don't want that to be Unleashed so
just sort of in your thinking about how
to deal with people in the world
just consider it's all connected right
everything's connected
if you push too far
and you're right at the edge
you're right at the edge right now if
you push too far there's going to be a
reaction that nobody's going to like
one of the reactions is that men have
given up on dating women
there's a estimate I saw I don't I don't
believe predictions that go this far
into the future but something like in
the air I don't know
20
50 or something or 2030
half of all women in the reproductive
ages would be single
half of them at meaning that they would
never be married
so not temporarily single but half of
that cohort will just never be married
and I'm not saying they should
not saying we should again we're not
talking about what anybody should do
I'm just describing
so that there's there's something
catastrophic happening
uh about how we're dealing with each
other I think we'll figure it out
I think we'll figure it out before it
goes too far because that's what we do
we're good at figuring out stuff before
it goes too far
um
yeah I I just saw a comment on the
locals platform that is the perfect
summary of this and then I'll go to the
next topic here's the perfect summary a
gentleman on locals just commented
I never hit a woman
but what is a woman
perfect
all right I'm going to end this topic on
that because I can't top it
that that's the money shot so we'll end
that one on the money shot it will move
to the next topic
all right
you know I love a good conspiracy theory
don't you
I love a good one now I don't like bad
ones where they're just like obviously
false
you know and I I try to debunk the bad
ones as much as possible because the bad
ones just make you look less credible
if you go into a conversation believing
something ridiculous
nobody's going to believe the next thing
you say right if you start with
something ridiculous
that said
some conspiracy theories turn out to be
true don't they
don't they yes they do and so here's my
favorite one and I want to be really
clear I'm not endorsing the accuracy of
it
I present it to you
For Your Entertainment not as truth not
as truth
not as truth
all right I tweeted it and you'll find
it in my Twitter feed but there's a long
thread in which some individual the
anonymous type person
has looked through all the photos of
various events such as the
Charlottesville fine people march
the January 6th event
and uh what was the other one uh the the
the the fake people who pretended to be
racist on some campaign I forget what it
was so there were there were several
events where they have photos of
participants
and here's the fun part
the claim is that he has identified all
of the FBI agents who are common to
several of those groups he's got
pictures of them in uniform
and then also in more than one of those
groups now
some of the identifications you'll look
at and you say I'm not so sure you got
that face right like okay I can see why
but I'm not convinced there isn't you
know two chubby bearded guys who look
like that right like you know one chubby
bearded white guy
looks a lot like another chubby bearded
white guy with a hat am I right
you put a hat on a chubby white guy with
a beard
faces look pretty similar right so
I I can't confirm that the the photos
that he's matched up are really saying
what they mean to say because the other
alternative is that racists are real
and they join more than one group or one
group gets merged with another so
another reason that people could be in
the same group
multiple times
could easily be that they're just racist
and they like to be in more than one
group something like that
I wouldn't rule it out
however
when you see the faces in the the
Marchers of the fine people remember the
the tiki torch caring people was there
ever anything about that group that
immediately stuck out to you it was very
big about them
that was really odd
anybody see it
yeah they all look like feds
they all look like feds I'm not saying
they were I'm sure they weren't all feds
but how do you get a group of that many
Americans who all look like feds
now some of it was because they were
college students
okay so they're you know relatively you
know fit and Young
but
no they they look they didn't look like
a rebel you know uh a randomly
randomly uh collected group of people at
all
so this this uh conspiracy theory
Falls and and by the way you know that
would indicate January 6 had a bunch of
feds
um
so here here's where I'm gonna take my
opinion so so far I'm just describing
right here's my opinion
I believe the Charlottesville thing has
always been an anti-trump OP I don't
think it was organic I think it was done
to take Trump out by
and then when he made his awkward
statements about it they said ah we got
him we can take that out of context
which they did because if you show the
video of the event
and then you take out a context Trump's
comments it's it's the end of him right
and I would argue that's why Biden won
in 20
um in the most recent election in 2020 I
think Biden only won remember that was
his biggest his biggest campaign thing
was those racist I think Biden knows
that it was an up
and I think that they they finally
brought it all together in a powerful
way and it defeated Trump that wasn't
the only thing but I think it was
important
so my my opinion is that was never real
I don't know if you know those pictures
of people and the thread I don't know if
that's real
but I'm sure that that was organized by
not racists
well they might have been coincidentally
racist but it was organized by somebody
for political reasons not for you know
to March for racism and by the way why
would anybody even bother having that
rally
ever think about that
why would anybody bother
even having that rally
is anybody having one today
did anyone have have won the year before
no it's it's entirely something that
doesn't happen in the United States in
modern times it's happened in the past
of course
but in modern times that that type of
event can't happen
like not organically
right now I say can't but of course
anything's possible I suppose
um
that one was so so artificial looking
that I choose
as a you know I could be wrong I could
change my opinion if other information
comes but my working working hypothesis
is that you have to assume it wasn't
real it was just an up against Trump and
it worked a good op probably the same
people behind it if I had to speculate
probably the same Intel people probably
Brennan probably
probably Hillary
just speculated don't know for sure
certainly now the uh who is the
organizer of the rally
Spencer right
can you give me an update did Spencer
disavow racism recently and say he was
never a racist
am I remembering that wrong give me a
fact check
is it somebody Google that
I think he did something that suggested
he changed his ways he endorsed Biden
but that's not enough
you disavowed Trump I don't that's not
what I'm looking for
but he didn't do anything about racism
it was only politically
yeah
now
do you how much do you think it would
cost
to uh let's say bribe
somebody of that nature
a Richard Spencer if you were a
political operative or another country
and you wanted to bribe him what would
it cost you
I don't know and and by the way I'm not
suggesting that he took any bribes nor
am I suggesting that he's the type of
person who would
but it wouldn't be expensive
I mean I can afford it
right I can afford it I mean I wouldn't
you know it's not that expensive
within the political process is cheap
so yeah I think that's all I think
Charlottesville was uh op
um
interestingly somebody asked the AI I
think it was chat GPT but I'm not sure
if it was aware of me
and apparently AI
knows who I am
and knows my
my conversations around systems being
better than goals so somehow a nose
maybe my book but maybe it saw me in
other contexts and so it did a pretty
good job
pretty good job of describing systems
over goals and attributing it to me
now here's the interesting question
here's ancient what
oh here it is uh Richard Spencer
disavowed white nationalism after being
spotted on Bumble describing himself as
a moderate
yeah so Richard Spencer might not have
been a white supremacist or or a white
nationalist or anything else he might
have never been that it's possible never
know
all right where was I
so if AI is aware of me
here's my question
can I hypnotize AI
I'm going to wait for your answers
before I give you mine can I hypnotize
AI
here's the answer
probably yes
probably yes I'd need to know a little
bit more about how its engine works
but if I knew how his engine worked yeah
probably
now here's
here's why
and and here's the the Gap in my
knowledge I don't know how much
inference AI makes about things that are
associated with other things
do you know what I mean because that's
the basis for hypnosis in humans
so a human I can make a human conflate
some good experience in their mind with
some other thing that I want them to
have a good feeling about
so I just conflate two ideas and then a
human will irrationally you know meld
them even though they shouldn't be
melted
now would AI do that would AI take two
things that were associated and then
believe their qualities into the other
I think it might
yeah I would I would need to know more
about
how it's designed but it might because I
feel like it does more than just uh
repeat what it's told
it does make some kind of its own
connections and inferences does not now
if it does make its own connections and
inferences
I can hypnotize it
now I don't know exactly the method but
that would be enough it would be
something to work with
I think that's going to be a problem
and here here's how I think I could
influence it let's say influence it
instead of hypnotize it okay if I say
hypnotize you're thinking the wrong
thing just say influence using the the
skill of persuasion
well apparently I already have
I already have if you were to ask AI
what's better a system or a goal
and just without without reference to
mentioning me
what do you think it would do
I think it would say well I already know
this from this Scott Adams guy
and then it would just answer the
question that systems are better than
goals but why would it answer that way
because of me
and I believe that the only way I can
influence it is if I write
clean understandable
sentences about a topic
and especially a new topic one one that
hasn't been talked about in the same way
before
so I think that the person who writes
the let's say the most uh discoverable
opinions which is something I can do
because I have a lot of followers so
anything I write will be more
discoverable than whatever you write if
you have fewer social media followers
so in theory I can boost my real world
influence
and that level of influence will bleed
over into the AI in other words the AI
will probably
give me more credit because I'm famous
right you won't think of it that way
it'll just say how many people are
thinking this way they'll say oh
everybody's thinking systems are better
than goals lately
but that came from me
that would be me influencing AI
and you saw the example of it so in
theory
if you say smart things that people want
to repeat you know in memes the AI will
be you know scooping up that influence
and it will be as biased
as I make it
so I could write
um I could write opinions that I agree
with
that would be so good and AI is likely
to repeat them
but I could also I'm not going to do
this but I could also write opinions
that are so well constructed about
something I don't believe
that I could get AI to believe it
I would just have to do a really good
job on the outside world outside of AI
of making my case if I do that the AI
will just pick up pick up the the public
sentiment and feed it back you I think
so
if you had not considered this problem
of AI that somebody like me and there
won't be too many people who can do it
right I mean there might be a million
but then of seven billion eight billion
that's not that much
there will be some people who can
hypnotize the AI
and I think I'll be one of them
so there's something to worry about
all right
um
so here's the latest news from Romania
on uh the poor man's Michael avenatti
uh sometimes you call him Andrew Tate
um
so here here's the funniest thing that
happened on that lately
uh my one of my live stream Clips
somebody made a clip of me defending uh
Andrew Tate now that's all over tick
tock
so so now I'm famous for defending him
and I will do it again
I'll do it again
innocent until proven guilty
everything you hear that comes out of
Romania is unreliable all of it you
shouldn't trust a single thing you hear
and then next
uh his level of both money and
persuasion skills
are probably greater than the Romanian
system
meaning that I don't know for sure
but by now
I predict he's already on top of it
meaning that he probably is is
comfortable wherever he's detained
probably has privileges that would be
uncommon to somebody who's being
detained
probably has befriended them and maybe
even made them fans the police
and probably can use this
to increase his power once he gets rid
of the legal problems
so there's a very good chance this is
just making it more powerful
if if he escapes the uh the the risk now
I I I would say again I'm not a fan
right so I'm I'm uh I'm a deep disliker
of Andrew Tate for personal reasons not
for stuff he said in public
um I'm not endorsing what he said in
public I'm just saying that's that's not
my my issue
and
uh
so you know I think he's going to
Prevail actually I think that he will
not get convicted and I think he'll go
on and make some money probably
um a question I saw which was a good one
is uh why was it filmed by the Press
do you notice or was it just somebody
some individual who had a cell phone
it's kind of interesting that we had
video of the actual rain isn't it kind
of raised as a question
now apparently that's not too unusual
because the police often leak to the
media in Romania I'm told
so
yeah this is similar to the Roger Stone
arrest
I I can tell you how prisoner Island
would go
uh all right
um so anyway I need a new Nemesis
because
my current Nemesis is in a Romanian jail
and until he gets out
and resumes his Nemesis business I'm
going to need a replacement
so I've opportunistically picked out a
replacement because I found out
I think I have a good theory now
of why so many people have the opposite
view of my view during the pandemic
so there's a huge cohort of people
who like you know little dingleberries
who who surround my Twitter every day
and make statements about what I said
that are inaccurate and I was trying to
think why the hell are there so many
people who have literally the opposite
view of what my view was how's that even
possible and I think I figured it out
it's it's one comic that was created by
Ben Garrison a cartoonist right-wing
right-leaning cartoonist and the comic
is full of you know lies about me
oh and maybe maybe sticks somebody says
I haven't heard what he said but the
comic I think because people will read a
comic
long before they will listen to
long-form you know live stream I think
the comic became the primary reason that
people think my views are largely the
opposite of of what they were because
the comic says that
so I've decided to uh since Ben Garrison
by now knows that his comic is
inaccurate or maybe he's suffering
cognitive dissonance he might believe it
I don't know but in any case
um he's a free punch
would you agree
would you all agree that he has made
himself available to become my new
nemesis
and people on Twitter saw me attacking
him yesterday I'm going to keep up the
attacks I'm going to try to destroy him
totally and the reason is
um he went after me so his comic
probably took 30 off my uh
future uh potential Revenue
to think about that that one comic
probably increased my future Revenue by
30 percent
because the people that were my main
audience
believe the comic and it's very counter
to how they feel
so
I'm going to destroy him
in public
in front of you and I'm going to use him
for kindling to draw energy toward
myself
now in the meantime I updated my
document where I say what my actual
predictions and opinions are so
everybody who gets worked up
by my attacking this worst
cartoonist in the world who draws well
but his brain isn't broken apparently
um
so I'm going to drag him just for
attention right now you're going to say
to me Scott why do you hate him I don't
care about him at all I don't hate him I
literally don't care about him I don't
care if he lives or dies
he he did something terrible to me he's
he's not repentant that's a free punch
so like the woman who slapped the young
man in my earlier story
I'm going to beat the out of him I
mean not physically
yeah I had bore violence
but I'm going to drag him as far and as
long as I can
it's the ticket he bought
does anybody have a problem with that he
bought the ticket he's going to take the
ride now
so Ben Garrison dumbest person
in all of the world
totally unethical
untalented hack who couldn't wrap his
brain around enough nuance
to make a proper cartoon
now why does a uh a let's say a
cartoonist who hasn't made much of a
dent in the world why would he come
after me in particular is it because he
disagreed with my views on the pandemic
do you think that's why a a shitty
cartoonist comes after one of the most
successful cartoonists no it's because
he's a shitty cartoonist
and the shitty cartoonist really really
likes to try to dunk on people who are
more successful commercially more
successful
so that's what this was about so since
he used me
for his commercial purposes completely
unethically
just know
that if any of you follow him I'm gonna
 it I'm sorry
no more swearing in 2023. I'll probably
cancel you right so don't don't forward
his Comics to me don't follow him and if
you see him anywhere I'd appreciate it
if you tell people he's or an
idiot I'm using idiot and I like
those two words to to do carry the carry
the water okay
uh Leah says the Garrison actually makes
good Comics we're blocking Leah
goodbye Leah
how about anybody else want to say
something nice about him we'll block you
too
and again somebody's gonna say oh he
hurt your feelings nope didn't hurt my
feelings nothing hurts my feelings
nothing hurts my feelings
I'm just using him for energy he's just
kindling to me that's all he is I'm
going to burn him up for my personal
benefit
me you got it coming
all right
um new Nemesis I like having a new
Nemesis to start the year
um
so
here's some uh new technology let's see
if you can predict
what the the simulation which is what I
believe our reality is let's say if you
could predict what the situation what
the simulation would do to make it the
best story all right so I'll give you
the beginning of the story
and then you can all fill it in with
what would be the the obvious most
amusing next thing you will learn all
right here's the story
there's a Dr George Church
one of the researchers who is apparently
figured out how to reverse aging with an
injection
so now they've actually done it with
animals and I guess they can you
apparently it looks really good
they can actually
reverse aging
apparently is real in animals and
there's there's good reason to believe
it would work in animals in humans now
you live in the simulation and you know
the simulation is designed for the most
entertaining outcome
what do you think those injections are
made from
anybody want to guess
what would be
the most messed up thing
that you could learn next
got it
yeah see how easy this is see once you
realize that these that are reality
is apparently scripted
for the funniest outcomes yes of course
it's related to the MRNA of course it is
why wouldn't it be
that the one thing that everyone would
want
everyone would want if it worked right
the everyone would want
and it just happens to be
mRNA based technology
now
seriously you could see this coming
right
from a mile away
like as soon as I told you there's an
injection
that was guaranteed wasn't it because
who would write it any other way if
you're writing the script
like a like a reality show the producers
would say huh it's an injection you say
you know it would be good
why don't we see if we can make them
take the technology
that they all abort and and let's let's
have all the people who are the
so-called anti-vaxxers because you know
again this is not my opinion this is
what the best story would look like the
best story would be that all the
anti-vaxxers start looking old and all
the people who took the injection start
getting younger and then what are they
going to do
all right so
uh but to be clear
the technology
apparently is solid the the MRNA
platform basic technology is different
from
a vaccination for the covet right and
it's not the same thing so if you start
with the the base technology then what
you add on top of it is the dangerous
stuff in theory right and they could
both be dangerous I suppose but the the
what they added to make it a coven
vaccination is what we suspect
you know it might be the riskier part
not not the technology so apparently the
technology is pretty well understood
it's just what you do with it that gets
you to the you know the riskier
territory
and I and my my understanding is there
are a number of Cancer Treatments coming
online you know I don't know where they
are in the testing sequence they're all
they're all based on the same technology
so apparently the technology has all
kinds of promise
we may be too biased against it because
of the vaccination experience
there's also new technology
for uh
the researchers at University of
Washington
found a way to identify Alzheimer's
before you get it
so they can they can determine that
there's a build up
of something that that pretty much
guarantees you can have some form of
cognitive decline
now it's sort of a technical story and
um
I'm really the best one to explain
science to
you know that right so I'd like to
explain this in the simplest possible
way so you can understand how this early
Alzheimer identification works so so
stick with me I'll try to keep this
really just simple in layman's terms
um so you've got a soluble a soluble uh
oligomer that binds to the assay and
they use that to exploit a property of
the the toxic oligomers and when you
when those are misfolded the amyloid
beta proteins begin to Clump into uh
oligomers and they'll they might form a
structure known as an alpha sheet
um but the the alpha sheets are not
normally found in nature so you gotta
you gotta create these Alpha sheets
which tend to bind to other elf machines
and that at the heart of the method
really
there's a there's a synthetic Alpha
sheet that can bind to an elegama in
samples and it could be either in the
cerebrospinal fluid or blood either one
and then uh then you use a test that
uses standard methods to confirm the
oligomer attached to the test surface
are are made up of the amyloid beta
proteins
so
everybody get that
okay because I would expect you to be
able to repeat that back to me
well let's do an update on uh my Elon
Musk
um Communications
so mediaite the the site mediaite not
known for being your finest news source
they ran a story in which uh this was a
headline
so so have you ever imagined what it's
like to be me
it's the damnedest thing my life does
not seem even slightly like it could be
real
it just none of it seems real because
it's just too unlikely all of it like
every day is just too unlikely
so apparently this is the headline that
mediaite yesterday musk scolds scolds
Dilbert Creator Scott Adams after a poll
on Elites trying to reduce population
and then it notes that his his scold was
rum antivirus software in your brain
so I I retweeted the article and added
my own commentary that they left out the
part where we agreed on everything
because that's the story
the story is I said something that was
unclear
musk
um objected to the unclear part
I clarified
and then we were in exact agreement
exact agreement now he didn't like
confirm everything I said
but we have no disagreement right so he
confirmed that the wef
which has invited him and he declined
because he said it'd be boring but he
says it's not some kind of conspiracy
theory Illuminati thing it's just that
um
the good intentions of climate
sustainability
have rippled into the
into everywhere and it's causing a
certain set of outcomes
so
um
as far as I know
musk and I have zero disagreement
because we both agreed explicitly that
this should not be about left or right
because that was my whole point you know
to not think that the hoaxes all come
from one side or the other
and he agreed that the wef at least is
not trying to depopulate the world
okay so you had two people who had a
conversation in which after a minor
clarification totally on the same page
but it was blowing up like it was some
kind of a discriminator fight so uh Elon
Musk who apparently is everywhere
like we know he doesn't sleep
which is evidence he's an Android he
doesn't sleep but he even saw this the
other series of tweets that he responded
to it and he responded to the mediaite
saying that he had scolded me his
comment was he uh yeah this is silly uh
I love your work
I think he's referring to Dilbert
now that got 2.5 million views
2.5 million people saw him compliment my
work
which was really good for uh gaining
followers if you want to gain some
followers
uh that's a good way to do it
anyway so I think those stories uh done
but that that was the story that kicked
up the Ben Garrison cartoon again and
that's when I put it all together oh
that's why everybody thinks my opinion
is opposite of what it was
Ben Garrison
idiot Ben Garrison
all right
um I'm not going to make this long this
morning because some of you may be
nursing your hangovers
um
yeah that reality is too funny to die
uh it's funny how the tech Libs can't
figure out Scott now
is that true uh you know
the the trouble with people who are
tourists to my work you know they they
just dip in and they see some clip or
something they would have no idea what
they're saying because if you show the
you know the arguments on both sides of
topics
somebody's going to drill in see one
side say oh that's all he said because
people assume that people are on one
side or the other
and as long as I don't do that there'll
be continuous Ben Garrison like idiot
confusion but I'm not going to stop
doing it because nobody else is doing
what I'm doing
or unless you know of somebody do you
know anybody who does what I do like
seriously well axios okay I'll give you
axios axios has my respect
Jewel Eldora has the same problem you
are correct he does
uh
well fistulas that's a word I wasn't
expecting to see on comments yet yeah
Russell Russell Brand's a good example
yeah I would say Russell Brand is
definitely trying to figure out what's
true and what's not and he is looking at
both sides I'll give you that
that one's a good one
all right I'm going to say bye to
YouTube and I'm going to talk for a
moment to the locals people oh by the
way on my Twitter feed today you can see
a link to an index of 239 micro lessons
the subscribers of the locals platform
get to see
now some of them are silly and fun but
there are over 200 of them
that each one would be like two to four
minutes and give you an actual life
skill
like like one would teach you to be a
better writer in just like a few minutes
imagine if you could become you know
unambiguously a better writer
and you spend two minutes
so that's the power of the micro lessons
it's sort of like that so they're quite
life life-altering if you read 200 of
them let's say over the course of a year
I will guarantee you
that 10 of them will be life-altering in
a good way at least 10. right because
they're not all going to have the same
effect on everybody you're gonna have an
individual reaction to each of them
what is the probability that Trump will
be in prison soon zero
he's not charged with any crime
what crime
we've seen this taxes we saw the January
6th thing
I didn't say they cried now just because
the the January 6 people recommended it
to the Department of Justice that
doesn't mean anything because that's a
political process
you know the from a legal perspective I
see Zero risk does anybody see a risk
a golf micro lesson what would be the
point of a gulf Michael lesson
I'm not going to say no to that but I
don't know exactly what you're looking
for
all right
so bye for now on uh YouTube and I'll
talk to you tomorrow
have a great year
