[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization the
best thing that'll ever happen to you
truly best thing and if you'd like this
experience to be wow like the kind that
you'll talk about forever well all you
need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea Stein again team Joker
flaska The Vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the doping in his
day thing makes everything better it's
called
simultaneous up it happens an hour ago
well
top of the news uh ASA Hutchinson has
entered enter entered the race
so ASA hodgensen he's in the race
our Rasmussen did a poll
and by the way I saw there were some new
people here
uh the for the new people would you like
to show how smart you will be and by the
way for the new people this will happen
to you too
you can see already on locals and maybe
you'll start seeing it a little bit on
YouTube the people there it is people
are answering a question before I've
asked it
before I've asked it
and the now watch this watch if you're
new this will be pretty basic because
you can see the answers right there
you see them streaming by and they have
the same answer and they I have not
asked the question
here's the question
according to Erasmus and poll what
percentage of likely voters have a
favorable opinion of Hutchinson
well look at that it's 25 percent
25 percent
you people are amazing
you're amazing
now for the new people I know I know
this looks like magic to you
if you're new to the live stream it
looks like magic it does if you were
watching I don't know Crowder or Russell
Brand can they do this if they can't do
this no I can tell you the news before
it happens
literally
I literally tell you the news before it
happens all right well pretty impressive
um if you don't believe that I can tell
you the news before it happens
where's pregosian
I told you you'd never see him again
certainly not in Belarus
well it turns out he's not in Belarus
not in Belarus at all
and the news is catching up as you know
see you then but CNN just can't let go
this made me laugh this morning
CNN news reporting
that you know the the Wagner offices and
pregosians I don't know maybe his
residents or something they were they
were all searched
and the Russian government is saying
that they they searched pragosians
belongings and then they gave him back
his stuff
and then CNN reported it
[Laughter]
Russia gave progression back your stuff
and he's just driving around Russia
he's he's somewhere in Russia just
driving around living he's just living
his best life
issues
Hey where's progressions he's in St
Petersburg no no no he's in Moscow I
think it's in Belarus
but I'll tell you what he's got all of
his stuff and he's living his best life
that's totally happening
that's what you believe if you've been
watching CNN you got an RV he's got a
Murphy
he's got an RV
oh my God the mental the bet a little
bit image of bergosia just driving us
driving RV around Russia
everything's fine everything's good
how's things going progression
oh I've never been happier
got to see the country
it's a good thing I've got an RV so I
can hold all my stuff but they gave back
I got my Bitcoin back there
big pile of cash yeah when the Russians
found that big pile of cash the first
thing they did was give it back to
purgosian and you know what's
interesting they gave him back his stuff
without knowing where he was
I don't know how they did that
that probably have a really good mail
service
uh address it to uh burgosian uh in your
RV Wherever You Are
and then he got his stuff back
oh my
so uh threads launched as you know the
Twitter killer application from
Zuckerberg
and I guess I'm sure this is already a
dated number but over 30 million people
signed up right away
see what that's about
um but out of 30 million people
uh what what number of them said they
were thrilled by the product 30 million
people signed up number total number of
people were thrilled by the product
they're pretty happy it exists
no it's not 25 percent
no it's not 25.
I haven't heard anybody
has anybody heard even one story even
one
of anybody who went to threads and said
oh yeah yeah this is going to be good
oh
I'm so happy to be on a on a Twitter
with no interesting people ah
I haven't heard a single person say they
liked it
I've heard people say it exists I've
heard people say they've signed up I've
heard people say they used it
not one person said they enjoyed it
can you think of a product that would
have a 30 million customers and none of
them are happy
actually none of them
I mean there might be something like
Democrats who are happy that there
aren't uh trolls there
how long do you think it will take to
put trolls there if it gets filled with
Democrats
in theory is serious threads should
evolve into the Democrat Twitter right
do you kind of expect that
if there's a Democrat Twitter do you
think that any
do you think any Republican trolls might
uh
just for fun
might take a Wanderer over there
maybe just saunter over to see what's
happening on threads
in theory it'll just be this Cesspool of
Democrats and trolls and nothing else
but
but I say this jokingly now the question
is will I sign up what do you think
will I sign up for Threads
see if you can anticipate what I would
do
will I sign up for threats
yeah of course I will of course I will
but I would use it just for
you know promotion
so use it for promotion that's fine for
that
uh we'll see what we'll see what happens
all right
there's a big story today that Jimmy
Jimmy Dore had a
piece where he's he says that the CDC
knew the mandates were based on a
falsehood and they lied about it
even knowing it and that we know that
now because of documents and emails
so we know that when the CD said CDC
said these vaccinations are great and
they're stopping the spread and all that
that they knew it was a lie
now have you seen that in the news
did you see that on Fox News
no I didn't see it there do you see it
on CNN
no no did not see it on CNN think it's
true
nope
nope do you think Jimmy Dore showed you
the document
or did he show you somebody talking
about a document
I don't know
um here's how I would look at this
critically I only looked at a little bit
but I didn't see any documents
and if this had been true wouldn't you
expect it would be in the news
it would be the biggest news wouldn't it
it would be the biggest thing in the
news
now you don't think that Fox News would
cover it
Breitbart
I know do you think it's true
my guess is if I looked at the documents
and heard what the CDC said maybe it's
you know and let me be clear I hope it
doesn't sound like I'm supporting the
CDC you're not getting that are you
this is just about the quality of news
and information it's not about the CDC I
don't have you know because I don't know
what's real
I have no idea what's real in this story
but is it likely
that there would be a publicly available
document that says the CDC clearly knew
they were lying at the same time as the
document
and the News isn't covering it
I'm going to say there's something wrong
with the story
I'm not supporting the CDC I'm not
saying that they told the truth I'm
saying that the story has something
wrong with it I just don't know what
Jimmy Dora put down Scott Adams in a few
pieces that's true
now I so far I have the best opinion of
the pandemic meaning the most accurate
predictions
Jimmy Dore and a lot of other people
fell for some hoaxes about my opinions
so usually I think Jimmy Dory was
reacting to the hoax not my actual
opinions I'm not sure that he disagrees
with me about anything
but he would certainly disagree with the
hoax version of my opinion as do I I
also disagree with the hoax version of
my opinion
but now we see that I have the best
opinion on Trump related Politics the
best opinion on the pandemic by far
nobody even came close
best opinion on pregosian and the
Ukraine war
so far by far nobody's even close
that is after my biggest mistake which
was saying that Russia would be stupid
if they attacked Ukraine because it
would be a disaster for Russia and it
would be obvious
and it was a disaster for Russia and it
was obvious
they did it anyway so I got that one
totally wrong
but I do have the unambiguously best
predictions on everything important
it's true oh you can hate me for it I
practically hate myself
but it's true
who had the best opinion about the
secret Sonic weapon that was attacking
the embassies
I didn't I'm the only one who said it
was fake from the first day
totally fake
all right so if you're tracking my
record of success I would say I seem to
be best at telling you what's not true
I think are probably less good I don't
know for sure I think I'm less good at
telling you what's true let's talk about
the Kraken the Kraken got me excited
because uh it came from what I thought
at the time was a it was a real Source
but in the end I had the best opinion on
the elections by far
because I told you from day one that
would be there'd be all kinds of claims
about election impropriety
and I told you that 95 of them would be
fake guaranteed
and that I didn't know if there would be
five percent that were real
but 95 would be fake guaranteed
did that does that pan out
do you think my 95 were fake panned out
exactly it was exactly correct now I
don't know if there's five percent
that's true
don't know that but at least 95 percent
of them were not true we can we can say
that with some
some certainty at the moment
and you were wrong now the other thing
that I said which is the only smart take
on the election Integrity is that it's
not auditable so you can't know
you can't know if it was rigged it's not
knowable and
if you have a situation where there's a
reason to rig it and there's payoff and
lots of people involved
and all that that
um the rigging is guaranteed
it's actually guaranteed by the
situation the only thing you can't
guarantee is when and how much you can't
guarantee when
you can't guarantee how much but you can
guarantee it because it's a situation
that guarantees it happens over time you
just don't know when
it's the best opinion on the election
nobody if you say it's guaranteed you
know that it was rigged well
I haven't seen the proof
if you say you you're sure that it
wasn't
I mean that's just crazy talk
so you can't be sure of either one but
you can be sure that the situation
guarantees it will be or has been
so by far that's the best opinion of the
election now I did get excited about the
Kraken
so I'm not going to try to minimize that
but even with that
by far the best opinion
all right because remember the the
Kraken was also under the 95 rule
when the Kraken happened I'd already
said but be be careful 95 will be
 and that just happened to be
part of it now on the Kraken I was the I
believe I was the first person in the
country to say there there's no way that
the general
the Venezuelan General stuff is true
right was I the first person probably
the first person in the country who said
in public there's no way that's true
it by its nature that's not true
so that was probably the best opinion
all right there might be still a kraken
in the future but no Krakens yet
so we don't know about Jimmy Dore we
know he was wrong about me
I know he was totally wrong about me but
we don't know if he's wrong about this
yet
all right there was a study that says
early risers are happier
like uh the there's a strong correlation
between getting up early
and not being depressed
do you believe that in science
it's science
it must be true
because it's in the media and it's
science
do you think
I'm just going to speculate for a moment
I'm I'm no Science Guy
but uh I wonder
I wonder if you are depressed
so I'm not depressed so I'll have to ask
you if there's anybody depressed here
no there's nobody depressed here because
you didn't get up on time to watch this
but
hypothetically is there anybody who has
ever been depressed can you answer me
this important question again I'm no
scientist I'm not a researcher but it
just seems like an obvious question
when you're depressed do you like
getting out of bed
you like getting up and attacking the
day
or do you say to yourself you know I'd
rather be unconscious frankly I think
I'll sleep another two hours
so one wonders if there's a cause and
effect that may be reversed or maybe
like every other study we've ever seen
in the news forever where they get
always the cause and effect reverse
every time like every time
it's almost impossible to see something
that doesn't look like they've reversed
the cause of the fact I feel like
science is 75 of people trying to fool
you into thinking correlation maybe it
does mean causation in this case maybe
it does
75 percent
25 it's actually causation I mean just
making up these numbers but by far the
majority of these stories are not true
by far they're not true
so if you were to believe a story like
this because it was in the news well do
that at your at your caution
now they do say to their credit
um it's not like they didn't it's not
like they weren't aware that there's a
causation correlation uh issue here they
did say that you can uh
decrease your risk by 23 percent by
shifting your sleep schedule
do you believe that
do you believe you can decrease your
risk of depression by becoming a morning
person
about right actually
so one of my little rules about science
is that if your anecdotal observation of
life
happens to match the science that
doesn't mean it's true
that's way better than if it doesn't
match right I always use cigarettes as
the example science says cigarettes give
you lung cancer
and sure enough
I know several people who smokes
aggressively got lung cancer I know one
person who had lung cancer and didn't
smoke cigarettes in my whole life
right so that sounds about right
probably
um and when do they say that shifting to
a morning person makes you happier that
also matches my anecdotal experience
because now I'm not I don't know if it
would make any difference at all to
organic depression so I'm not sure if
they're defining depression in the real
clinical you can't get out of bed kind
of way or if they just mean people who
say they're depressed because they're
sad but it's you know it's not exactly
the same clinical situation
you you could definitely change your
experience of life
from bad or average to pretty good by
getting up early
I don't know if that's the same as
depression
isn't isn't depression an actual you
know sort of chemical physical problem
that's more than just what's happening
in your life
they thought it was but
I could certainly say that people who
would describe themselves as depressed
but maybe they're not clinically exactly
technically depressed the way a doctor
would say I could see that those people
would be happier
and there's a really good reason why
the first several hours of my day I
don't have contact with other people in
person
do you know how good that is for your
mental health
do not have contact with other people
for the first few hours you're awake
it's amazing
so like most of you I've had good days
and bad
right like you know life life gives you
ups and downs
but I would but I've said this before
that I've almost never in my entire
adult life never
had a bad time
between
four and nine am
ever
it just doesn't happen
between four and nine a.m every day
seven days a week 365 days a day I'm
gonna have a great time
now I love doing this which is why I do
it during this time
so this is like purely fun for me
I mean it's sort of a job but it was the
best job ever because it's doing exactly
what I'd want to do like exactly I don't
do a single thing I don't want to do
right now which is talking to you about
fun topics that I would like to talk
about anyway
so
so if you told me you could take me from
somebody who sleeps until 10 A.M
and you can convert me to somebody who
guarantees as five excellent hours every
day those five hours are not just okay
they're really good like I love the
morning I love it afternoons afternoons
can be good or bad evenings
can be good can be bad mostly they're
good I don't really have too many bad
days but the mornings are guaranteed so
if you tell me that getting up shifting
from waking up at 10 A.M to shifting to
four or five a.m makes you happier I'd
say absolutely you just added like a
quarter of your awake time you just
improved massively
so when they say you can reduce your
risk of depression by 23 percent diets
that hits right on the nose of my actual
experience right on those it's about a
25
everyday Improvement because of just
those hours being awesome
highly recommend that you experiment
with getting up early if you say to
yourself you're not a morning person
they also mentioned in the study that
you might be able to change yourself
into a morning person
now I didn't think I was a morning
person
until I was
I don't know how uncommon that is but
I've heard other people shift to the
super early morning and made it work
so but I do think there's a difference I
think some people's natural biology
would not allow them to do that but you
might be surprised if you're one of them
all right there's a new
Kamala Harris uh
word salad nonsense video I don't think
we have to play it right do you need do
you need to see another one just trust
me it's her trying to talk and failing
right which we're completely used to at
this point now
uh it's funny that every video of Kamala
Harris talking in public gets labeled a
cringe video
a cringe video imagine if the if your
major candidate for office for vice
president
whenever they talked about any Topic in
public people cringed and went oh God
every time
like every time
so
I'll tell you the lesson here
this is my one of my mother's greatest
lessons you know you can get used to
anything if you do it long enough
yeah and then the punchline to that was
including hanging right if you get hung
you get used to it if you do it long
enough
you just get used to anything
we actually got used to having a
president and a vice president who were
not
let's say verbally gifted
right when Harris and Biden were running
it was very clear that they were not
um it'll say gifted in the communication
skills you know they weren't really even
up to the level that most politicians
are
most politicians
but am I wrong that it's gotten worse
that's not my imagination right
but not only has Biden gotten worse from
obvious decline from age I mean I think
we all see it
but it seems to me that Harris used to
make sense
somebody tweeted today a video of her
from before she was vice president in
which she was a as some Congressional
hearing and she was getting tough on
somebody and she sounded like she was
completely in control
she sounded like she understood the
world and knew how to talk
but she doesn't she doesn't display any
of those skills that were well on
display before she became vice president
what's up with that now that's what
fooled me completely
because early on I'd picked her to be
you know likely president
and
it was based on early videos of her
performing her job and I said oh there's
somebody who's you know not only tough
has a commanding voice you remember I
talked about a commanding Voice versus a
pleading voice
she had a commanding voice you know she
was a woman of color
she was a Senator she was young enough
you know she had the right backers I
mean it looked like she had the whole
package
something happened
and it looks like drugs
or alcohol
now
I'm not saying I know that that's the
case I'm saying that it's obvious to the
public that you have both a president
and a vice president
who can't communicate for different
reasons
but we're actually going to have that
same pair
who we know can't do basic communication
the the most fundamental part of the job
is to show up in in public and say
smarter things to make us feel good
you know at least half of the job and
there are two candidates who can't do
that thing
which is talk to the public and make us
feel good
not at all
now how did we get used to this we're
we're actually going to enter an
election phase
where we actually have somebody who is
clearly mentally incompetent
who is running with somebody who can't
form a sentence in public
and those are not exaggerations
are they
is that an exaggeration to say Kamala
can't form sentences in public
not really that that's pretty pretty
straight just describing what's
happening
can Biden give a you know inspirational
speech and handle questions and do no he
can't and nobody thinks he can there's
nobody he thinks he can
so how in the world did you get two
candidates the number one and the number
two who can't do the most basic
human activity of having a conversation
that makes sense
to actually make sense
they can't do it
now you could say all kinds of bad
things about Trump
some of them I might say well you get a
point there
but does anybody ever say he can't talk
he can talk he's really really good at
it and and the contrast here is
insane
because Biden and Kamala Harris I think
you would agree that unless you throw
Dan Quayle into the equation
that they would they would set the
record as the two least capable public
communicators
is that fair the two least capable
public communicators who are in those in
those jobs I've never seen anything like
it
now I've said and other experts have
agreed that Trump might be the best
we've ever received
now his opinions are a problem for you
know many people in the country but his
ability to communicate
isn't just average
Trump is not average
he might be
the best president Communicator we've
ever had
you just don't like what he's saying in
some cases right now if a fake is not
yet a president but vivekis off the
charts his communication skills which is
crazy good so I mean I feel good about
that
so we do have people who can do the job
it just
um we may not pick them yeah Reagan was
insane but I think I think Trump might
even be better
yeah Reagan was great there's no doubt
about it but Trump yeah of course I'm
judging Trump also by his tweets
yeah Reagan didn't have Twitter so I
don't I don't feel the like Reagan's
Twitter game would have matched trumps
because Trump is actually so well uh
let's say he's a perfect fit for the
times you know it's we're we're in crude
times
so crude Trump fits crude Twitter just
perfectly
so
anyway uh but the fact that we that
we're looking at one of the you could
say at least one of the best
communicators of our time against the
two unambiguously worst
and it's still going to be a close
election
it's still going to be close
so that's pretty absurd
uh speaking of absurdity
I saw a tweet by Miriam Grossman she's a
Doctor MD
and she says I woke up today to learn
that the CDC endorses using powerful
drugs to induce nipple discharges in men
who then claimed they can breastfeed
P.S some of the drugs are then consumed
by the infant yes the CDC our tax
dollars
um well let me give you some advice this
will be for the babies
if you're a baby
and you're raised on
a male nipple milk
and someday you have a conversation with
your your mom because there's there's
probably two parents involved here
and you say to your mom like hey Mom
what was I breastfed as a child as a
baby
if your mom says to you
technically yes
stop asking questions
stop
just just stop
just just let yourself out slowly like
this
just sort of Fade Into the background
like that
that's at the end of that situation
here's what you don't want to do
this would be the big mistake was it was
I breastfed mom
technically yes
don't do this
hey what do you mean by tactically
don't do that
don't do it just just walk away
and if you do find out that you were fed
by your
nipple milk
from from a male
um here's my next advice
don't mention it to your classmates
if you're in high school don't mention
it
do not mention it to your classmates no
you'll think that you're just sharing
you'll think you're sharing your
feelings and maybe just sharing
something don't do not do not mention it
to your classmates
or your co-workers
or your future spouse
or anyone ever
ever
however the good news is that Ben and
Jerry's has a new flavor it's called
male nipple milk
and Ben and Jerry are making it
themselves so they're going to be making
a special batch they've just got a take
their nipple making drugs and they'll
start filming those containers
Ben and Jerry's nipple milk all right
let's talk about that cocaine found in
the White House
the big story today is that some people
are speculating
that the administration is trying to
throw a couple errors under the bus
which she would love by the way
if it's a yellow school bus
she love it she love it if you can throw
a cobble Harris Under a bus don't pick
like a municipal bus
she doesn't have much to say about that
but yellow school bus oh God she loves
those whoa so if you throw her under a
yellow school bus she'd be happy she
could you know plug in her Wi-Fi I think
she'd have everything there but
charge your phone
uh but I forget what I was talking about
I just got all excited about the yellow
school bus I can see how it gets people
going
I do not believe I do not believe the
hypothesis
the the idea that the administration is
throwing her under the bus
that would not be their best play
they could get rid of her other ways you
don't want to admit that you picked a
cocaine user for your vice president
that wouldn't be the good way to do it
if they need to get rid of her you know
maybe that'll happen
but they're not going to do it that way
they're not going to plant drugs on her
I mean really
do any of you really believe that they
would plant drugs on their own vice
president
does anybody really believe that
some do
some do well one way it could be
possible is as somebody who was a dirty
trickster did it
for the purpose of removing her but
maybe you know would not have been a
sanctioned operation or something no
maybe but but if you're telling me that
Biden approved an operation to plant
cocaine on his vice president
how many think that how many think that
Joe Biden approved an operation to plant
drugs on his own vice president
no no no he didn't do that
no no no
somebody believes it
yeah but how many would believe that you
know the Deep state would do it
ah well that's different yeah the Deep
State might do it I just don't think it
would be the best way to accomplish
their goal might be the worst way
so it seems very unlikely to me so I
dismissed that possibility as uh super
unlikely
but
uh what else is new let's see we're
seeing more reporting even from CNN
that cameras are everywhere
so
how is it that we have not heard
whether or not for sure there are
cameras there
isn't that weird that that we're somehow
okay with that
what's wrong with the news the news is
completely broken
at the very least there should be a
confirmation that there was always a
video surveillance
right
how is it that by now we don't know the
answer to the question does the
videotape show who put it there
isn't that a pretty basic question
pretty basic we don't know that
it's funny
um I saw a gentleman on Fox News Fox and
Friends I think but I I wish I had
caught his name because he made a good
point but if you if you saw it could you
mention the name I'll give them credit
for it it was the
um oh I think it was outnumbered no it
was unoutnumbered
so our number they have a bunch of women
they have one man there who's the
outnumbered one who is it this morning
it was such a good point I want to give
him credit for it
all right well maybe you'll come up with
a name because I know some of you
watched it but anyway his point was that
if if the
if they had determined that it was
Anthrax do you think you wouldn't know
who it was
this is such a good point
right
if the powder had been Anthrax and and
thus it looked like a an attack on the
president
do you think we wouldn't know who put it
there
[Laughter]
I mean seriously
seriously we wouldn't know who put that
there if it had been a poison
of course we would
so of course they know who put it there
of course they know by now
why aren't they telling us
now do you think that your your white
house administration would be so corrupt
that they could know who put it there
and they wouldn't tell you
and then you never know
yes they are yes they are
that is correct they are they are
corrupt enough to do that right in front
of you
absolutely
all right
um
so of course the Democrats needed a
summer story to
um counteract I'll talk about this new
whistleblower
uh
about the bidens but uh in order to
cover up the negative stories of the
cocaine in the White House and the new
whistleblower uh you'd be surprised to
find out there's more about the boxes
yeah the Mar-A-Lago boxes are now a big
story today why
because these other stories are getting
too much attention so you need to you
know throw in some box Judo
Judo
and today uh Joe Biden uh
became a mass murderer but what about
those boxes yeah yeah sure Joe Biden is
possibly approving uh
cluster Munitions for Ukraine which
would be outlawed in every other country
because they're too dangerous to
civilians but it looks like we're going
to do it
no problem
all right
um but those boxes whoa that's a real
problem it's not the cluster of
Munitions and the possible nuclear war
it's the boxes
but the new story is that this poor
assistant to Trump who went with him
after the administration Walt notta
well it turns out that Walt nutta
allegedly was a not a boy he was a not a
boy
that's right the naughty one is called
nata
and because it's a simulation so all the
names are just jokes
um and he's alleged to have taken 50
boxes somewhere and then allegedly he
took fewer boxes back which would
suggest that somebody kept a bunch of
boxes which was not supposed to happen
and uh
uh but here's what CNN reports that
there's either I don't know if it was on
tape or
some eyewitness quote but Trump is
alleged to have said
uh we uh what happens if we just don't
respond at all about the boxes and don't
play ball with them Trump allegedly said
quote wouldn't it be better if we just
told them we don't have anything here
now how often has Trump uh gotten in
trouble
for a what if
it's what he does on every topic which I
like
I like that he asked what if about not
just the things that everybody knows are
practical but he always asks what if
about the things that are edgy and that
nobody's talking about and maybe would
be dangerous
it's not a problem to ask what if
that's not illegal
so if you if in the context of a legal
conversation let's say there was an
attorney there or he was just talking to
advisors if he said what if we do this
the context of that what if
is that he thinks he owns the documents
the what if
certainly not disconnected from the fact
that he thought he owned them
so if you think you own them
what if we don't give them back is a
perfectly ordinary question
there's nothing even provocative about
that
I think I own these what if I don't give
them the back like what's the penalty
what happens isn't that just an like an
obvious correct question to ask
if you believe they were yours now if
you believe they were not yours
if you knew they weren't yours or you
couldn't make an argument that they were
yours then talking about how to not give
them back would be evidence of
you know a mental state that is Criminal
but CNN leaves out the context that he
probably thought he owned them
right because
you know or at least that he thought it
was a gray area that he could win which
would be about as good
so
I think yeah it's the usual framing to
make it look like it's more of a big
deal than it is I feel sorry for this uh
Walt NADA guy because he he may be
caught up in let's say a process crime
around a crime that he didn't commit
so I hate that
um and if you did get committed you know
if he did get let's say convicted for a
lying probably it would be because he
was trying to protect his boss
and I would hope that that boss would
get elected and then pardon him
which is possible
Trump could get elected and then just
pardon anata but as others have pointed
out being a trump supporter or working
for Trump is basically a suicide pact
uh has anybody done well after
supporting Trump or working with him
I mean it certainly was bad for my
career my career got totally tanked just
by saying you might whip so everybody
pretty much everybody who's had an
association with them has had oh yeah
that's true Sarah Sanders did great
she's a governor now
yeah okay well we do have we do have
some examples of people who did great
all right
let's talk about this new whistleblower
you heard that uh in the issue of Hunter
Biden maybe taking bribes from other
countries allegedly that there was a
whistleblower that was missing
and everybody said missing
how did the whistle blower become
missing well now we know
according to the Whistleblower
now all this is alleged right
but if you see the video there a video
surfaced from The Whistleblower his name
is he's an Israeli Professor Dr gal Loft
and
I'll give you my take
you know how you can tell some people
are lying when they talk you know when
Adam Schiff talks it's just obvious he's
lying when swalwell talks it's obvious
he's lying you could pick some
Republicans that it's obvious when
they're lying right it's not just one
side there are some people who are
really obvious when they're lying
um this guy doesn't look like he's lying
now I'm no I'm no mind reader
so I can't know for sure
but I'll tell you this whistleblower
sounds really credible
apparently he has a history and you know
a domain of credible work with credible
people for decades all right so he's not
a nut
he's not a nut nobody thinks he is
and he and this is a really scary part
he doesn't even seem to be a partisan
like he doesn't even associate with the
political party
his story is that even before the laptop
and this is very important the timing of
it before the laptop
he had already reported to the
government and said I'm seeing these
briberies happening because I guess he
worked as an advisor for a Chinese
company that was bribing allegedly
bribing Hunter
and and Joe Biden so he saw it firsthand
C cefc right some Chinese company and
they're attached to Chinese intelligence
Etc
now he reported to the government that
he saw the Biden's taking bribes
effectively or or at the very least it
would be a far a violation you know it'd
be working for a foreign government
without registering
so lo and behold what do you think
happened to The Whistleblower who had
first hand credible information that the
bidens were on the take
well if you said he got charged for the
very crime that they were committing
you would be right
they charged him with the crime he said
Biden committed
they charged him with a Farah violation
when he had apparently nothing to do
even in that domain
they charged him as an arms dealer
apparently he's never even been involved
in that business
so and then and then there was something
about the one of the investigators that
came after him
was the same one who was involved with
the Hunter's laptop
so the same cast of characters who
apparently are trying to silence The
Whistleblower and trying really hard as
in a lot of illegal if the
Whistleblower is correct
um
that the same cast of characters were
involved in covering up the rest of the
stuff
so
he looked really incredible to me
uh and he's in hiding and he's in hiding
Because he believes the American
government
is a criminal organization out together
and he is a credible person
he's not some Wing job
he's actually credible
and
it's right there he's got the goods he's
got the details and he had it before the
laptop before the laptop
so the government has known about these
accusations from before the laptop and
you never heard about it did you you
never heard about it no they decided to
punish The Whistleblower and put him in
jail so future whistleblowers will know
not to do anything like this
so now let me say just so I've covered
all bases if tomorrow it turns out he's
a nut
don't tell me I didn't see it coming
totally possible it's totally possible
yeah it's totally possible he's a he's a
kraken
but I will tell you he doesn't look like
a nut
so if he's a nut he's really good at it
all right now contrast this to the uh
the UFO whistleblower when I listened to
the UFO whistleblower none of that
sounded true to me none of us sounded
true coming out of his mouth
and sure enough
no no photographs of those UFOs yet but
when this guy talked it just sounded
real
and I would say at this point I feel
confident that we do know that our
president was on the take
I feel confident that that's just true
now I could be I could change my mind if
there was some big investigation and
found out this was misleading
information I could change my mind I'm
not so I'm not so invested in this being
true that like I couldn't say oh I got
that one wrong
by the way I don't know if you notice
that I'm doing this intentionally
one of the ways you protect yourself
from cognitive dissonance and
confirmation bias too is you tell people
at the same time you give your opinion
that you could be wrong
because that gives you something to rely
on later if I if you find out you're
wrong you don't have to hallucinate why
you were really right all along and how
you know the truth isn't the truth
that's what cognitive dissonance is I
don't have to
I'll just say remember I told you I
could be wrong about that well I guess I
was wrong
so it's a really good mental um hygiene
it's a good way to protect yourself from
your own cognitive dissonance you just
say at the same time totally possible
I'm 100 wrong
as long as you've said that you have an
escape from cognitive dissonance you
just go to that yeah I said it could be
wrong
surprised but I said it could be
it lessens the power of your predictions
that's okay
why would I care about that
it lessens the persuasion of my
predictions but not the power of them
it only makes you maybe less likely to
believe something that you shouldn't 100
believe which is exactly where I want
you I don't want you 100 believing
anything I say I'm just telling you what
things look like
we'll all be surprised all right part of
this story from The Whistleblower is
that the bidens had a close association
with a one-eyed
a one-eyed FBI informant
who was giving them good stuff to give
to the Chinese I guess
that
apparently FBI director Louis free had
one eye still does still has one eye
so he was the former FBI director maybe
at that time but he still would have had
connections
um
now just to be clear
he's probably not the only person with
one eye in the FBI
or that ever works for the FBI
right so don't assume that he did
anything
I did hear I did I'll just tell you I
heard this morning from somebody who
knows the free Family
and and who is not who is not
anti-republican right somebody who would
be friendly to the Republican side I'll
just say that who knows the family and
says no way
it would be just a shocker
if if that specific family was doing
something like that
now that's just one opinion
but it's somebody who's you know who had
a contact with the family who just said
that doesn't doesn't feel right
but you know anything's possible Right
we can be surprised by anybody I I would
tell you that if you're sure that it's
Louis free that's being referred to I
wouldn't be that sure
it wouldn't be that sure but there is
evidence that I think the free family
and the Biden family
uh has some long-standing connections
that doesn't mean that's the the
one-eyed source
but they do have a long-standing
connection with a one-eyed FBI head
which would be a weird coincidence if
it's a coincidence but it could be it
could be a coincidence they wouldn't be
the biggest one you know as coincidences
go it would just be sort of an ordinary
one it wouldn't be like a spectacular
one because there's got to be more than
one person with one eye
all right
well there you go
uh and uh I guess Louis free also uh did
work closely with Hunter Biden in
Romania
in Romania
that doesn't sound too sketchy at all
does it
the Hunter and Louis free were
collaborating in Romania I don't know
over what and that free contributed a
hundred thousand to an education trust
fund established for Joe Biden's
grandchildren what
because that's what friends do
that's what friends do
yeah yeah you know I can't tell you how
many people I know
who have started uh college education
trust funds for other people
other people's children
oh it happens all the time
it's happened to you right haven't you
had your family friends uh start a
hundred thousand dollar education funds
for you even though you had plenty of
money
yeah even though you didn't have any
money problems
people will often come up to you and say
I know you have no money problems you're
actually quite well off and but if you
wouldn't mind I'd like to give a hundred
thousand dollars to your grandchildren
why
oh don't ask
don't ask
now remember
every part of this story is early fog of
War
I don't know if he really did that
if he really did that well that
certainly raises some questions but
maybe he didn't right it's a little too
early to say that that yeah that's
pretty on the nose it's a little too
early to say that any of this really
happened maybe that we'll find out just
don't assume it's any of it's true yet
all right
I would like to give another shout out
to
jenk whose last name I apologize for
always saying wrong but I think uyghur
jankweiger from The Young Turks
apparently he agreed with the Supreme
Court both on
denying loan student loan forgiveness
and also for overturning affirmative
action
so what's amazing about the story is
jenk is a very identified as a let's say
a pretty extreme anti-trump
pro-democrat voice
but this is now the is this the third
time
he's he's gone against Democrats you
know a really basic Democrat attack line
it's like the third time in a few months
now each of the times he's done it
he's he showed his reasons and his
reasons were common sense
they were just common sense they weren't
even political right and he seems to be
um he seems to be engaging in what I
call Extreme normalness
so Jake is actually making news by being
extremely normal
in other words he simply looked at the
issues and he decided on them based on
their merits
and it looks so weird that he's trending
he's trending because he looked at some
big issues
on their merits
which in this case did not go toward the
Democrat side of the narrative and he's
getting torched he's getting torched by
his own team
for simply making a decision based on
the merits of the of the topic
so
I would like to just give him uh you
know a uh ascending ovation
for being an independent thinker well I
want to be very clear I don't agree with
him on all of his views nothing like
that and nor do I require that of
anybody that I would respect
but my respect for him is off the chart
right now just off the chart
so
um because you know that cost him money
right you know that jenk is taking a
financial hit he paid a lot of money
potentially
a lot of money
to try to tell you what he really
thought
right which also makes me think that
when he disagrees with me he's not just
taking a party line
it means he actually disagrees because
I've seen now three examples where he's
willing to agree with me as long as the
facts suggest that makes sense
so I would say that Jenks
credibility right now is just through
the roof you know best in the business
right now
didn't expect to hear that from me did
you but when I say credibility I don't
mean he'll be right on everything
I mean that when he tells you something
you can actually believe that that's his
actual opinion
and I do not believe that when I listen
to the news or the pundits or most of
the people on social media I don't even
believe it's a real opinion it just
looks like a team opinion
but from now on probably till the end of
time when I hear Jank give an opinion
even if I hate it I'll think that's his
real opinion but I'll also take it more
seriously
because I know that he can look at he
can look at the actual you know pros and
cons of stuff and make a reasoned
decision that disagrees with his team
he's a very rare character now and he
did that for himself you know he did it
honestly and I have immense respect for
it it's just so valuable that you can
want you can trust one person
so there's one person you can trust it's
his actual opinion good for you
all right we'll fight later over
something else I'm sure
all right um
what else uh funny funny tweet from
gnome uh bloom
who showed the the article headlines in
a little uh paste up and one of the
headlines was about Latinos or becoming
the new face of white supremacy another
one that the Asians of the new helpers
of white supremacy and the other one
that says you don't have to be white to
be a white supremacist suggesting that
black people are sometimes white
supremacists too so gnome Bloom tweeted
those headlines and then his comment was
white supremacy is more diverse than
Harvard
white supremacy is more diverse than
Harvard
and maybe not technically correct
pretty damn good
pretty damn good so gnome good job
all right
I mentioned before that Glenn Greenwald
is calling this out that Biden looks
like he's prepared to send cluster
Munitions to Ukraine
which has been banned by even our allies
even our allies won't use it in war
because it's too dangerous for civilians
and Biden's like yeah probably yeah
we'll send you some of those over there
cluster bombs
um wow
so that might be happening
um
at this point is there anybody who
believes that Ukraine is going to break
through and get all their territory back
does anybody think that's going to
happen
nope does anybody think Russia is going
to break through the Ukrainian lines and
take Kiev
nope
does anybody think that anybody who dies
from this day forward in Ukraine is uh
was a good good use of people
do you think the people dying today on
either the Russian or Ukraine side are
dying for anything
for anything
nope not for anything
nope every death now has no purpose
whatsoever not Ukrainian not Russian now
they can't stop because I guess if one
side stopped that'd be a problem but
you need a trump to say the war is over
you need a trump to say the war is over
but I worry that ending the war was
never the intention of the
administration
does it seem that we have the American
Administration do you think Biden wants
to end this war
there is no evidence of that is there
there's no evidence they're trying to
win the war all of the evidences they're
using it as a way to you know drain
resources out of out of Russia and uh
basically turned him into a third world
country
and it looks like it might be working
right it you know I've said this before
that there's a whole bunch of things
that will be near breaking points
but if they don't break
you'll never know they were ever near
the breaking point
because it's not like anything's bending
so
I think that Russia itself as well as
the war probably you're really close to
some breaking points in like a variety
of ways so I heard somebody say that I
have no idea if this is true just an
example that Russia's uh
funds are running out what is it there's
Sovereign funds or something so that at
some point they just won't have the
money to pursue the war they'll just run
out of money
uh I don't know is that true
I know
um others say that the you know the the
technical sanctions will basically make
their all their industry crumble because
if they can't get replacement parts
nothing works
so they'll just you know they have
trouble there
um
but then again there's a war itself
you know maybe
you could easily imagine uh Mass
defections from the Russian army
right hasn't happened yet
but you could easily imagine it and you
can imagine that you're really close to
it
and it doesn't happen
but it could be really close
could be really close so there's a whole
bunch of things that could just turn
over like a domino any minute so it's
completely unpredictable situation but
the one thing that a president Trump
could do if he didn't want to destroy
Russia for whatever long-term strategic
reasons he could just say you're not
winning
nobody's winning you're wasting lives
that stop today we'll work this out
I think he could actually do that and
pull it off
I saw somebody else do a comparison
of where we are in 2023 in terms of Wars
compared to
Prior times apparently there are fewer
Wars going on right now than
historically has been the case did you
know that
the you know Ukraine obviously is a is a
big one so you have to include the the
size of the war that matters but in
terms of the number of Wars apparently
we're at something like a low
how about that you know I think most of
those wars were you know like
uh African Civil Wars and stuff like
that but for whatever reason we're at an
all-time low of wars
so if we get rid of this one we'd be
much better sheep
no not because there are fewer countries
because I'm just comparing to say 20 30
years ago and roughly the same amount of
countries
all right did I miss any stories today
you think Wagner knocked out the African
Freedom Fighters that could be at least
in some places
uh well I don't know if the French are
having a civil war
I remembered who it was
uh I think it was uh Naseem Talib
who wrote that when Islam gets a 10
percent
um
Traction in your country that you can
predict it will take over
now I don't know if it was ten percent
maybe you could do a can you do a fact
check on that
do I have that approximately right I
don't want to misquote Talib
the reason I don't want to misquote them
is because I often criticize him if you
criticize somebody you don't want to
misquote them that's just a bad look
ten percent all right so I'm getting
some confirmation that he once said that
10 and he had he had an argument I
remember I read his argument and it
sounded pretty solid and you you can
imagine how it works because you can see
it in this country
the
um would you agree
that the black population of America has
an oversized
um let's say footprint on all of our
decision making domestically you'd agree
with that right and you know African
Americans are 13 of the country
but that 13 has as a way out of
proportion impact on everything we do
now imagine that that instead of being
black Americans
who are perfectly happy to be part of
America if you know if things could
improve a little bit
um but black Americans are Americans
right they want better situation in a
variety of ways but they still want to
be Americans they still want to have
democracy and you know all that stuff
but if you had 13 of Islamic
fundamentalists
they wouldn't be looking to negotiate
they'd be looking for get anything they
want and I think I think the mechanism
is that politicians will start making
accommodations at around that size
so when you're in that you know five ten
percent range and you make a lot of
noise the politicians are going to start
changing things for your benefit because
it's easier
and then things just keep changing
let me give you an example let's say uh
13 of the country were is islamist
islamists
I hope I'm using the word record if we
were 13 islamists what would be our
current policy on immigration from
Islamic countries
you see it if we had 13
islamists already here
there would be tremendous pressure on
the government to increase immigration
of other ISL from other Islamic
countries so you could go from 13 to 20
really quickly
yeah in terms of the Arc of a country be
fairly quickly once you get to 20
percent
things can happen kind of quickly after
that right because remember one of the
things that Islam has as a strength in
terms of its spread is that if you're a
you know a serious old school devoted
Muslim once you're a Muslim you can't
leave
you could be killed you know I mean not
this is not we're not we're not talking
about American Muslims for the most part
we're talking about you know more
fundamentalists
but that fundamentalism could easily you
know find its way into any other country
such as France and I think France is
already gone
I think France is essentially on the way
to becoming an Islamic European country
and and that's because I'm agreeing with
Talib that there's there's an obvious
mechanism for it to happen
and if nothing changes the obvious
mechanism for it to happen
we would expect it to happen and I don't
see anything that would change the
mechanism
all right
what motivated the crib sades
good point
would you see an equal decrease in
wokeness oh I think awokeness is
um is dead
right so we've now seen that even Larry
Fink had a BlackRock is disavowing the
use of at least the term yesterday he
says it's embarrassing now because he's
getting too much feedback he's being I
guess Jim Jordan and Thomas Massey and
somebody else are asking uh BlackRock to
come in
to talk about ESG
because apparently there's an argument
that it's Anti-Trust
you know some some kind of colluding
industry collusion
for ESG somehow they can make that
illegal I don't know
but she got ESG is in crisis the
reporting is that the big companies are
are downsizing their Dei departments all
right you don't downsize them because
it's working nobody downsizes something
that's working
and now that the news is saying that the
other big companies are downsizing Dei
it makes it safe
so if you're the if you're the 10th
company to do it nobody notices so now
it's safe because the news reported that
everybody's doing it now everybody can
do it
so you've got Dei on the decline you've
got ESG on the decline at least
reputationally if not in reality but
reality would follow a reputation
um you've got
uh male nipple milk
from the CDC like that's a headline
story today
that male nipple milk will be you know
recommended by the CDC I guess now
there's nobody who doesn't think that's
ridiculous except for ridiculous people
all right
yeah it's not like the Democrats are
saying yeah male nipple milk ah get me
some of that
I'm so thirsty I can't wait to get some
male nipple milk
nobody's saying that all right so that's
the point of ridiculousness where you
can just mock it openly
you can't mock openly and I don't think
you should somebody's lifestyle choice
of how they present themselves
I think that's fair people can do what
they want to do they're adults you can
present yourself in any crazy way you
want according to somebody else's
opinion of what's crazy we're all
allowed to do that
but it went to male nipple milk once you
get to male nipple milk we can all just
we can all just make fun of it once you
can mock it and that was what was
missing
you you couldn't mock
some elements of wokeness without
getting slammed but now you can say it
out loud right you saw what I got
canceled for we don't have to bring that
up again
but you can see also that after I got
canceled people now can say that openly
everywhere
they can say what I got canceled for
openly everywhere
now am I wrong
you see it on social media every day
every day people say at least get away
from Mercedes
you know get down to say these which is
saying the same thing the people who say
get out of say this they're saying what
I said
they're just using different words
all right
um
yeah getting away from people who
overtly say that they don't like you and
that you're the cause of their problems
I think everyone agrees getting away
from them
I've never seen anybody who didn't
yes cities is the new Urban you're right
that I didn't notice that but you're
right
get out of cities is the new racist dog
whistle but you know what's different I
think people even if you said hey
if you're saying getting out of cities
is uh if somebody tells you
that you're being racist for saying get
out of cities do you know what's
different
what's different about this
so so you say people should get on
cities and then somebody says that's a
racist dog whistle what's your what's
your response
yeah that's probably true
it's probably true
right
you could just say it out loud now
hey that's really racist you're saying
get out of cities you could just say out
loud yeah yo in a way you're really
right that's a good point
I'm still going to do it because my
personal safety
is my business
you get that right
if I if I'm doing hiring in a company
that is sort of everybody's business
if you're running for office that's
everybody's business
you want as much diversity you know I'm
in favor of the courts and and as much
as possible within reason that
businesses look like the community I
like that our government represents you
know looks a little bit like the people
that's all good
but if you're talking about your
personal safety
that's nobody's business
there's nothing in the Constitution that
says you've gotta you have to justify
your personal safety decisions to
anybody
nobody gets nobody gets a second better
than that so if they would like to
characterize your decisions as racist
the correct answer to that is yeah I can
see how you'd say that
I can see how you say that
I get your point your point is well
taken
but it doesn't it shouldn't make any
difference to your decision
your decision is your decision it's just
personal safety you're just playing the
odds as you see them you could be wrong
about the odds but you're playing the
odds as you see them that's always legal
you know unless you're doing an actual
crime
