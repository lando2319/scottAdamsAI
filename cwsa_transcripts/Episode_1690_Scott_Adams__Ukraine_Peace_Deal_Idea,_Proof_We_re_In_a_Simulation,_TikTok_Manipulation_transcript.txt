[Music]
good morning ladies and gentlemen and
all of your pets
i assume you've trained your pets to
watch the live stream is there anybody
out there who's got a cat or a dog
who are just doing their own thing
during my live stream
it's rude really
so if you've got a cat or a dog get some
treats and train them to sit in front of
this live stream with you
and if you'd like
both you and your pet to go to a new
level well you're going to need a dish
for your dog but for you a cup or a mug
or a glass of tanker chalice of stein
you can't eat jugger flask of vessel of
any kind and you take that thing and you
fill it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing makes
what
that's right everything better
everything go
yeah
yeah yeah
whoa
well uh in the news today
trump won a court case over his uh
defamation suit that stormy daniels was
i guess suing trump for defamation
and uh
trump uh at least
he prevailed in court and now stormy
daniels owes him 300 thousand dollars
now
there are a lot of people
who say
how can you say trump is so smart
and they'll give some examples right
but
trump is the only person i ever know
i've ever heard of
who
slept with a porn star and got paid 300
000 for it
i'm just i'm just saying
now i know i know he's just breaking
even because it's uh it's just paying
back his for his lawyer's fees but still
it's funny
it it's funny when the prostitute
returns any money to the customer
allegedly because trump says he had no
affair with this woman no affair
no affair
totally didn't happen
all right
our president who was elected biden
uh almost entirely on the assumption
that he would be adult leadership and
more importantly
he would not lie to the public
the way that awful president trump did
and yet he did stand in front of the
public and lie about hunter's laptop
being russian misinformation
at what point
do we acknowledge that the reason he was
elected
didn't pan out
yeah somebody says elected in quotes
now that would be a funny way to treat
the 2020 election
what if instead of you know making any
kind of accusation about the
uh accuracy of it
instead of that what if every time you
talked about it you just put the
election in quotes
sort of a very low grade protest
all right
uh brit hume is tweeting on kabul harris
and did you see her
speech talking about the significance of
the passage of time
so kamala harris has become almost like
a colbert character except for liberals
you remember when colbert used to do the
fake conservative character for his show
and
kabul harris actually
just sounds like she's doing a parody
allow me to do a parody
that sounds exactly like the real thing
well we were just talking about the
significance of time
and how the significance of time is
sometimes overlooked because over
over a long time period the significance
of the time
will be more than the shorter period of
time
because time if you look at it over its
entire significance
can be something that starts as
insignificant and becomes significant
over time
because the passage of time
creates the significance
so that ladies and gentlemen
i just saw a meme that made me
it made me laugh and hate myself at the
same time
have you ever laughed at a meme and said
i hate myself for laughing at that
i'm not a good person
but
okay that just happened
um and i think it's important that kamal
harris has reminded us of the
significance of the passage of time
do you know why
time is significant
that's right
because if we didn't have the
significance of time everything would
happen at the same
moment
that's no fun
everything's just going to happen at the
same time now i think kamel harris is on
to something
about the significance of the passage of
time
we overlook that
um
as uh mike cernovich was recently
commenting in a different scenario i
think or maybe it was this scenario i
forget
that when you see all the mistakes go in
one direction
you should start asking some questions
is there another example in the news of
all the mistakes
seem to go in one direction
well dr nicole sapphire
tweets that this week the cdc
removed a total of 30 000 covades from
the dashboard
for young people it reduced the total
pediatric pediatric deaths by 24
they said it was a coding error
just a little bit of a coding error that
changed the numbers by
25
that's right a little bit of a coding
error that changed
some would argue
the most important number
by 24 percent
that's a pretty big change and as uh
cernovich would remind you and i will
echo that
you have to watch for problems that all
seem to be in the same direction
you know what i mean i just keep an eye
on this one
see see if there's this slow trickle of
information that says coven wasn't
nearly as bad as we thought
do you think that's going to happen
now a 25 change
probably wouldn't have changed any
policies
but you don't have to get much bigger
than 25 before it looks like it might
have you know if you said the pandemic
was really 25
fewer deaths than we thought
i don't think it would change anything
would it
25
50 maybe
but i don't know about 25 percent it
affects trust yes that's true
um but i don't know how you could have
uh less trust in something you don't
trust at all
well i was reading up on tick tock in an
exeus story did you know that 63 of
american kids have tick tock
did you know that did you know that if
you write the words uh tick tock
on the locals platform
the spell checker will correctly
um put the brand name there t-i-k
t-o-k
with no space
did you know that if you try to write
that same thing in the title to um
its competitor here on youtube
that it won't lay it won't it won't
correct it to the correct spelling yeah
you have to work at it
you know it's gonna like did you mean
tick flock no no tick tock did you mean
flick block
no no tick tock
now it might have been my bad typing but
i believe that youtube didn't want me to
say tick tock that's all i'm saying
um so here's what we've learned about
their algorithm
and i want to put this in persuasion
frame
have i taught you way too many times
yeah ducking tick tock
have i taught you way too many times
that
pacing and leaving is
good and basic persuasion the pacing
part is where you agree or match the
person you're trying to persuade
so if they wear a blue shirt you wear a
blue shirt
if they talk loud you talk loud if they
use let's say a lot of war analogies
like jumping on the hand grenade and you
know taking that hill well you you use
war analogies
so basically the more you can match
somebody you want to persuade
by pacing them
uh the more influential you'll be when
you try to lead them leading meaning
instead of following them
you you do your own thing and try to get
them to follow you
so first you match them
and then when you
you take a break from what you've
matched they're they're all somewhat
automatically and
subconsciously
will match you so it's basic known
persuasion technique
here's what the tick tock algorithm does
the others do not
the instagram algorithm for example
uh wants to show you things that
instagram wants to show you am i right
so it's going to show you more famous
people and celebrities and
high quality
stuff
whereas the tick tock algorithm we're
told
simply gives you more of what you've
shown you like so if you click on a
certain thing it's going to give you an
endless stream of that until you try
something else
so what happens if you have an app that
just keeps giving you everything you
want like really specifically everything
you want
do you know what happens
well first of all you get addicted to it
because it's giving you everything you
want it's like
it's reading your mind practically
the second thing that happens is if they
decide to lead
you will have been so paced
that anything you see on tick tock is
going to look real to you
especially
if you're
12 years old
so tick tock is the ultimate brain
washing machine and i believe the only
reason it's legal
is because there's not a general
understanding of how powerful it is
if if people understood how much
influence tick tock could have now i
don't know if it's been weaponized so i
don't know if it's ever been used
to specifically you know create a
something i know there are some chinese
stories like tiananmen square that have
been
banned on tip top tick tock or
suppressed
but
that's not what i'm talking about i'm
not talking about just hiding things
i'm talking about making somebody think
a new thing that they didn't think
before
and tick tock is just ideally
suited for that now if you didn't know
tic toc is owned by a chinese company
which means that the chinese government
can get any of their data just by
telling them to give it to them
and they could tell tic toc to run any
any content they wanted and just feed it
to people as
as something that they would consume
just like all the other stuff they were
consuming
so
tick tock really should be banned
apparently there's some effort to get
the american
customer data into some kind of a server
in the united states
so that china doesn't have access to it
but it feels a little too late for that
63 percent of
american
young people are on it
all right
here is proof
of the simulation i saw a quote a tweet
by
twitter user who calls himself dr
fauci's prison butt
i have no comment about the name he
chooses
but dr fauci's prison but
he says this the fact that in quantum
physics observing a particle changes the
behavior of that particle
to me proves this is a simulation
it's the game rendering itself in real
time
i agree
i agree the fact that in physics we know
this beyond a doubt
right so this is not a speculation in
physics we know
that observation changes the behavior of
stuff and it doesn't even have to be
human observation it could be a machine
measurement
can change the behavior of a thing even
without touching it
is simply the knowledge of the
if you can believe this
it's the knowledge about the particle
that changes it
is not even the it's not because you
shine light on it or you split it it's
not because you're manipulating it
we've literally we've literally learned
that simply knowledge of it changes it
now
how can that make sense the only way it
makes sense is that the is that we live
in a software-like simulation
that is authoring itself on demand
the only time things become what they
need to be is when you're there
or there's some machine there measuring
it because later we would have access to
the measurements so that's the same
thing
how do you know what it was doing before
observing
um i'm not the physicist physicist who
can answer that question
but we do measure
there is a way to do it
uh which you would be satisfied with if
it were described to you
but i won't i'm not capable of doing
that
all right um
so that's one i would say that that's
pretty
um
good proof in the simulation
the other thing is our massive uh
differences
in opinions or movies
have you
of course you've noticed
that
it's not a case of some people are
smarter and some people aren't that's
how you used to think of it right
you used to say
hey some people believe x and some
people believe y
but the people who believe y are
underinformed
if they did more research they would all
believe the same thing
but it's clear now
that what you know doesn't seem to
impact what you believe
or or how how much research you do or
you know how smart you are none of it
seems to matter at least not completely
matters a little bit
and
um
so i would say
that
we're absolutely living in a authored
world
and a couple more ways that you can tell
is i've been testing recently
if i just
speak out loud to the creator of the
simulation
and ask for something
i've had the weirdest experiences
recently now this is part of
affirmations but without all the work
so affirmations you sort of repeat what
you want over and over again but i've
literally just talked to the talk to the
simulation like i literally talk out
loud like i'm talking to somebody who
can hear it
and i say you know what i need
give me x
and x is like really unlikely
and then x happened
i asked for some
really weirdly specific stuff that
happened like the odds of them happening
are like really low
boom it was just like i ordered a
doordash
now you should believe that that's
coincidence and anecdotal and means
nothing
but is there anybody here
who's had a recent experience of asking
the universe for something and it just
handed it up
i'm just curious now you you may be
working from a religious model or
whatever
but but look at the comments and i feel
like the
that it's happening at a higher rate
than it ever happened like i've always
asked the universe for things in various
ways affirmations or positive thinking
whatever
but
i feel like something changed
where it's almost like a vending machine
now if you just ask specifically what
for what you want the odds of that thing
showing up are just crazy
i mean i i wish i could give you
examples because you know they're in my
personal life and
it's none of your business
but the it's the specificity of them uh
did you ask for a divorce yes
yes
i did
um
now the thing with divorce
that i think people don't understand at
all is that when you decide to get
married it's because you want to
and when you decide to get divorced
it's because you want to
in both cases you're getting what you
wanted
a lot of people are treating it like
it's a tragedy for which they feel sorry
for me i mean it's a it's a problem you
have to work through
but i don't know if it's a tragedy if
you choose it
is it
if it's a path you decide to take
i don't know i mean it could be hard
but i don't know that that's a tragedy
so i don't think i don't think that you
know at least speaking of my specific
situation
i'm pretty sure that we're both better
off
so i don't have a
have a problem with it
yeah of course there's a prenup
of course
um
i prayed for food and then i ran over a
cat
all right
um here's the other evidence of the
simulation it's the recurring problem
thing
so i would say in the last you know
number of
years or whatever i've had some really
weirdly specific recurring problems
that i can't find anybody who has the
same ones but mine just keep coming in
in different form but it's the same
problem just over and over again and i
was just talking to somebody else yeah
the the water leak is one of them it's
but there are several
that are just super recurring and i was
talking to somebody yesterday who has
their own recurring problem that i've
never had
so somebody else has a completely
different recurring problem
i've never had once
i don't think
so how is that possible
um
well
my belief is that we're we're a b
testing for some other higher level of
civilization
and at the moment
those recurring things that used to be
happening just in my life
are now happening in the world
is it a coincidence that we keep having
russia problems
is that a coincidence
is it a coincidence
that we keep having supply chain
problems
in every form you can have it
is it a coincidence that we don't just
get one bad virus we get like
a cycle of them to really
really see what if you're doing it right
it feels to me that even the ukraine war
is an a b test
testing the idea
of whether a modern military can attack
and conquer another modern military
with a land war
and i think they're finding out they
can't
and that that's what they're trying to
find out
okay could all this military beat this
military if the little military has
access to
good weapons
the answer is no
so
i don't know that it's a coincidence
that the world keeps serving up the same
things
it's almost telling me that trump is
going to run again for sure
because they they want to do one more
test
of what happens if somebody acts acts a
certain way
i don't know
i keep an eye on that but uh certainly
looks like we're in a simulation and
we're a b testing a number of
problems
um
let's talk about the supreme court
nominee
um
blah blah all republicans are racist say
democrats
blah blah
minority
check the box hiring
blah blah
it's all the usual stuff
there's i don't think there's anything
that's more boring than this particular
supreme court nomination
because
she's definitely going to be nominated
she has all the qualifications as far as
i can tell
there's just nothing here
there's nothing here she she would be
replacing another liberal even the court
doesn't change
this is the most nothing story and i'm
looking at people like josh hawley
who are who are taking a run run at her
you know to try to
try to degrade her in some way i don't
think there's no way that she's not
going to get nominated i don't think
but isn't he just wasting his time and
making himself look bad
what do you think of the josh hawley
um strategy
of obviously he's getting some attention
for himself
obviously so that could be good and he's
probably playing to his base
so the bass likes it probably right
but does it move the needle in any way
does it help him get elected in the
future
i don't know it seems like a waste of
time
the smartest thing that
i said this before the smartest thing
the republic's republicans could do
and it would be really smart
is to just be really polite to her and
then vote unanimously to
put her on the court
because what happens the next time the
republicans nominate somebody
the next time republicans nominate
somebody they want to say look
when you gave us a nominee that was
solid we gave you 100
support we're going to give you a
nominee that we think is solid you give
us 100 report
now i know you're saying it's payback
payback
but remember how the news treats the
precedent
the news treats precedent like it
matters
so if the republicans take this one
that's really a gimme
because you know which way it's going to
go they're not going to stop the
nomination
so if you know it's going to turn out a
certain way you might as well grab
whatever advantage from that you can
and grab the advantage of saying look
when you gave us a qualified nominee
were we racist
did anybody act racist when you gave us
a qualified or misogynist
when you gave us a qualified
black
female candidate did any did any
republican have a problem with it nope
unanimous
i mean it's almost like the republicans
are trying to lose this next election
is that does anybody disagree with me
with this basic fact that strategically
the smartest thing the republicans could
have done given that she's going to get
not get on the court anyway
and it doesn't change anything
wouldn't the smartest thing to
to try to get a unanimous vote
now people disagree but give me a reason
in the disagreement
right
makes no difference
because you're not fighting back is that
why
um
dems will never reciprocate it's it's
not that you're asking the democrats to
reciprocate so let me be more clear
i do not believe
that democrats would reciprocate and
that's not important to my point
do you get that
there would be pressure on democrats
from the media
if if the republicans had just done a
100 percent agreement on a candidate i'm
just saying the media would put pressure
on the democrats i'm not saying the
democrats would want to
and so it would make the democrats look
bad would it not
don't republicans like that
don't you think the republicans would
want to go into an election say look
when they give us a qualified candidate
is there any do you see any racism no
you don't
all we wanted was a qualified candidate
it would be easy to say that
and they would get all the political
benefits of saying it
i don't know to me this is a no-brainer
i mean
this is the simplest persuasion question
that you'll ever see this one's really
easy
so if you're thinking in terms of uh tip
for tat that has nothing to do with the
suggestion i i'm definitely not
suggesting
that democrats will play nice if you
play nice because there's no playing
nice in the idea
in fact you're not playing nice
you're playing as
let's say as schemingly
as you could
sorry about the word
but it would be the most uh let's say
manipulative
clever thing to do it wouldn't be kind
at all
it would just be putting pressure on the
democrats that's all it would do and
otherwise everything's going to be the
same because she's going to get
nominated anyway
so to me this is easy
like
there are very few there are very few
issues
that are this cleanly
obvious what is the right thing to do
and and the republicans have chosen the
wrong thing to do i don't know why
well
i'm starting to think that some of the
news is not exactly accurate
is anybody having that feeling
hey i'm starting to think that this news
isn't 100 accurate all the time
um
so i saw a tweet where they claimed that
seven
generals have been killed by the
ukrainians seven russian generals
um i heard petraeus say that three were
confirmed
and i saw tweet by ian miles chung
saying that half of that list of i think
there were seven are fake
um
that sounds about right
you know i do believe that maybe three
generals got killed but if you see a
list that lists seven of them
that would be hard to believe and i'm
not sure you should believe that
all right
let me ask you this
if you listen to the fake news and then
you believe it
and then just by coincidence you watch
that movie the matrix right afterwards
does your mind make the connection
in other words
does anybody realize
that they're in a simulated reality
even without the simulation so forget
about simulation theory where i'm saying
we're all software but forget about that
just imagine this is a real world it's
the only one
you know just sort of standard classic
reality
even in our classic reality
the citizens are walking around in this
illusion about the world
both sides you know i don't think that
the you know the right has it all right
and the left has it all wrong or
anything like that i think everybody's
in a different movie and none of the
movies are real
or not completely real
all of the movies have real
as far as anything can be real i guess
or at least verifiable facts in them
they're just not completely verifiable
so
we definitely live in effectively we are
in the simulation
because we believe the fake news
am i making that case enough if you
believe the fake news you're walking
around in a simulated
movie that isn't based on reality
who believes the fake news well we all
did six years ago
or we were more likely to believe it six
years ago trump changed everything
as i predicted
uh
uh ian told me today on uh
ian martissas on twitter that i don't
take enough credit for my
i think it was 2015 prediction that
trump would change not just politics but
he would change the entire way we see
reality
that actually happened
that actually happened
now imagine a more uh you know unusual
prediction than that that was a pretty
unusual prediction
all right um
so there's a russian critic this guy
alexa navalny so he's been a critic of
russian for years
they tried to poison him once but he
survived
allegedly
poisoned
he was convicted of fraud that was
probably trumped up
charged 2.5 years
no i guess the first one was contempt to
court and then they just gave him a nine
year sentence for fraud which i'm sure
is not real either or even if it is real
it's not the reason he's going to jail
so the reason is he's a critic
and
it's such a weird situation
to see a human being being tortured in
public
i mean he was literally poisoned you
know almost died came back
and now he's being jailed
repeatedly for probably bs
and
he's he's actually just being tortured
in public by putin
why are we okay with that
i'm looking at this comment scott turns
to trump to bait us then turns to his
handlers with h handlers talking points
snake in the grass
all right chasman senti
um you have you have the the floor
uh you believe that i have a handler
who is my handler
anybody want to take a shot at that
is it part of the new world order
is it
is it a globalist
could it be a globalist
who is it
okay
yes um i i got a correct answer on the
locals platform
uh
when i said who my handler is and who my
boss is
somebody correctly had the answer
my penis
that is the correct answer
it's the only thing i listen to
everything else is just a suggestion you
know what i mean
my stomach says it's hungry i say well
that's just a
suggestion my brain says it's bored i
think well that's just a suggestion
but when my penis says it's time for
action
it's go time
that's not a suggestion
that's an order
and i think you all know it
all right
i don't know what all that was about
um
let me make a suggestion for a peace
deal for ukraine
the saddest thing i've seen today is
that president zielinski of ukraine
apparently said he would consider a
peace deal
in which ukraine would say they wouldn't
join nato ever
in exchange for a ceasefire and the
withdrawal of russian troops and some
security guarantees
to which i say oh
so this uh wonderful zelensky guy
who is a hero
he's a hero
he destroyed his whole country
to get a deal that was on the table
before the war
is that really happening
is olenski literally
did he literally destroy his whole
country
to negotiate for the deal that was the
original deal
am i reading it wrong
what
the
f
is happening
all right well let me suggest how a deal
could be made or at least
framed so that it puts the pressure on
russia
and it goes like this
if you limit the deal to just stuff
about ukraine
you're an idiot
meaning whoever negotiates the deal if
they if they limit to what they're
negotiating to be about ukraine
stupid
they should this should be about the
entire uh russian military and ours and
nato
we should be looking at the ukraine
thing as the genesis for a larger
conversation about how never to be in
this situation again
we should say to russia do you need a
land bridge
we can make that happen
because we're not really opposed to
transportation
are we
are we opposed to transportation
how about their pipelines
are we opposed to pipelines well not
really in concept
how about we make some kind of a deal
to guarantee transportation
that they can reach the stuff they want
to reach
that they've got some control over their
russian-speaking people um who may in
fact have been
shelled by ukrainians
i mean does the rest of the world care
about that not really how in the world
can't we make a deal with russia the way
to not make a deal is to limit the
conversation to ukraine only stuff
we should be saying to russia
how about never having offensive forces
anywhere near the
border with another country just no
offensive forces
and the moment you put any offensive
capability
we're going to change everything
but as long as you don't have any you
know invasion looking forces on the
border
we won't
we won't make anybody else nato for
example
let's say as long as russia
never puts an offensive force on anybody
else's border
that uh
that nato will not take in any new
countries
because that's provocative and won't put
offensive military stuff
on their border as well
do you think we can't make a deal
and then you add
economic incentives and you say look not
only would we drop the sanctions
but maybe we can help you build some
other industry
operation gladio i don't know what that
is
but somebody paid 20 bucks to ask me to
explain the thing i never heard of
but thank you for the 20
of which
youtube gets a third and then i pay half
of it in taxes
oh give us a sign you're really the one
in charge of the globalist
movement by making klaus schwab do
something recognizably significant next
time he's on tv
challenge accepted the next time you see
klaus schwab
watch him uh
touch his nose
when he's talking
right now if you see him touch his nose
that's his signal
that i control him
okay
so there you go
you'll probably be seeing that precinct
um
any chance putin is the good guy
nope
i don't think so
uh let but let me put some context on
that
i think this is a case of two bad guys
the bad guys being ukraine in the united
states
being basically
and putin being evil
so if you're rooting for the
over the evil
i guess that makes sense
i mean is not nearly as bad as
totally evil i guess
but
i don't have even the slightest belief
that we're not guilty
of some bad meaning provoking and
creating this situation to me that looks
like it's on the united states
anybody disagree
is there anybody
now not excusing putin you know putin is
is
definitely
he's got some evil going on there
but that doesn't mean that the other
side is the good guys there's no white
hat black hat thing going on here
there's two black cats
fighting for control
and
i i have to admit i'm not super invested
in the outcome
as long as i get my wheat
and nobody nobody nukes me i don't
really care
because
um
i don't know i just don't i'm just not
invested
beyond how it affects us
all right um it makes me think
so here's the here's the thing
what's the thing here's the thing
the thing is
that when you see our negotiators
apparently not being serious
because i don't think we've even engaged
in a way that makes us look like we're
serious
is the real goal to just degrade
russia's economy
for as long as we can because the longer
we degrade their economy that
the longer it takes them to build up
good military
i feel as if none of this is about peace
i feel as if this has always been about
some way to permanently degrade russia
especially in a military sense
what do you think
or oh somebody says just lining their
pockets so another another frame would
be
the only people who want this are the
ones who are going to make money on it
and they have enough power to influence
everything else that could be
in fact
maybe that's the top
the top frame here
all right
rasmussen had a poll and they said are
electric cars practical for most drivers
uh what do you think are electric cars
practical for most of drivers so you're
not answering for yourself
you're saying most drivers
yeah it depends how you interpret the
question right
because i interpret practical as also
the low-cost alternative
and i don't think it's the low-cost
alternative even with higher gas prices
because we assume gas will go down at
some point
so i'm not sure that the poll was
capturing people's opinions so much as
how they interpreted the question
but
52 said no electric cars are not
practical for most drivers
and i would guess that that 52
are not totally up to date
because i don't know if you have an
electric car but there are charging
stations
and there is a convenience factor of not
going to a regular gas station i mean if
you charge it at home you're probably
doing all the driving you need without a
charging station and so
i wonder if elon musk needs to do a
little more work
you know he can't immediately change the
fact that electric cars at least a tesla
comes with a price premium
but
um i think the the public is behind the
technology
would you agree with that if if more
than half of the public thinks electric
cars are not practical now forget about
climate change or anything else that's a
separate conversation just the car
itself as a tool
half the people think it's impractical
that feels like they're just behind
right in knowledge
wouldn't you say
all right i'm getting a lot of
disagreement so
people are not so i guess a lot of you
think that electric cars are uh
inconvenient
based on what what would make them
impractical besides cost
yeah okay if you're saying stuff like
lithium or you can't recycle the
batteries and stuff like that that's not
exactly on point
because you don't worry about recycling
any of your cars you just drive them and
then sell them to somebody else
somebody says no charging stations well
it depends where you are
right so if you're in california there
are plenty of charging stations if
you're in somewhere else maybe not
yeah
do you think 52 percent of the country
lives somewhere where they don't have um
easy access to charging stations
actually that's probably true isn't it
even more than that maybe
so i'm going to say if if access to
charging stations was your
main thing and you answered the question
that would be a good answer
yeah i think depending on where you live
i can see half of the country living
where they don't have many charging
stations
would you buy that
would you buy that half of the country
lives where there aren't enough charging
stations yet because they're probably
just in metropolitan areas
yeah okay
uh kid rock had some interesting things
to say
i guess tucker carlson interviewed him
and he claims that when he was hanging
out with trump
that trump said uh
quote what do you think we should do
about north korea
and kid rock said
allegedly he said unlike what i don't
think i'm qualified to answer this
[Laughter]
and then and then there's uh the story
says some people online are are
questioning whether that conversation
even happened let me give you some
insight
you know because i spent some time with
trump
in the white house
just sort of chatting
that's definitely something trump would
do
if you ask me to bet on whether kid rock
is telling this accurately oh yeah i'd
bet on kid rock i'd bet totally
because i had the same experience not
about north korea
but trump actually asked my opinion
about something
and i think
i think you don't understand how gifted
trump is
with his interpersonal skills
you have to understand how gifted he is
he's really gifted
one on one just working people and stuff
so if you're meeting the president of
the united states
and the president united states says to
you regular citizen
what do you think i should do about
north korea
what's it do to you
you fall in love with him
that's what happens
trump doesn't just make you
like him
he makes you fall in love with him male
or female
older young black or white
he makes you fall in love with him
when he stands in the oval office the
most important person in the world and
says to kid rock what do you think we
should do about north korea
do you think he was looking for a
strategy
no he wasn't looking for a strategy
i don't think so
i think he was i think he was doing
something that was insanely cool
for kid rock
he was giving kid rock an experience
and it was cool
do you think kid rock didn't love that
i mean you know it's funny that he said
i don't think i'm qualified against that
in fact it makes me want to elect kid
rock for president next
the fact that kid rock knows he's not
qualified to answer the question on
north korea just makes me like him more
i was like okay
i like that
because i'm not sure i would have
answered the same way
i probably would have given an opinion
so so i say kid rock's credibility went
way up with me and if i had to bet on it
i would say
99.99
this conversation happened just the way
he he recounted it
that would be so exactly what trump
would do
all right um
that is by far my favorite story of the
day
um how many of you believe that there is
a new world order
i guess uh biden
used that term new world order in a
speech
and how many of you even know what that
refers to because there's a current
what wikipedia calls a conspiracy theory
about the new world order
in the comments how many of you believe
that there's a new world order and i'll
give you the definition from wikipedia
uh
let's see a new world order um
is a conspiracy theory about a new world
order that is a secretive power elite
with a globalist agenda
so do you believe that there's a power
elite secretive
you might know where they are but
they're secretive
with a globalist agenda
and some of you say it's not a secret
it's code scott
it's code
well
here's what i think
hasn't there always been a global elite
trying to
move the world in their favor
that's always been the case hasn't it
what changed
does something change
now
let me ask you this
i've told you that i've spent some time
behind the curtain
and by that i mean seeing how things
actually work in politics and how the
news is you know
generated from absolutely nothing
so i've spent enough time behind the
curtain that i have a very strong
opinion
about whether there's a global elite
like a like a illuminati or something
running the world
and the answer is no
there
are lots of them
there's not one global elite
there there are bunches of them
and they all have their own agenda they
all have their own opinions and they're
all maximizing their own
life basically
and
i would say that it's more
more accurate to say that there are
elite
rich elites for each topic
it's not as if there's one group of
elite people who is trying to affect all
the topics
that definitely doesn't happen
there's nothing like that but there
definitely are secret billionaire
collections of people working behind the
scenes to get what they want that's very
true i can confirm that for sure
so
um
i'm not sure that you need to add the
concept of a new world order
meaning that i don't know if it adds
anything to what you already knew
you already knew that the elites tried
to make things work out in their favor
let me ask you this is your assumption
about the new world order
that it would be better for the power
elites or are they trying to do
something
altruistically that they think would be
better for the the world
what do you think
if you believe the conspiracy theory
i'll call it a conspiracy theory because
wikipedia does
if you follow the new world order idea
um
what are they doing
is it good for the elites or is it good
for the public and they're just trying
to do us a favor
somebody says they're trying to
consolidate power
now that would be consolidate power
meaning that there would be
organizations
that could control things in multiple
countries right
i don't see that happening
what countries are giving up their
sovereignty to the new world order
uh it seems to me that we go on a
case-by-case basis
all right
uh clapper calls it the consensus
community okay
um
new world order is
let's see
malevolent detentions
yeah don't they have conflicting
interests that's right
so
the other thing you have to realize is
that the global elites don't all want
the same thing
some want climate change maybe they've
invested in solar panels some want uh
more regular energy production maybe
they own oil companies right so the
elites are not all in the same team
they're all working for themselves and
they're on every team
somebody says concentration of wealth is
the goal
no it isn't
who has that goal
who has a goal of concentrating wealth
i've never even heard of that
i've heard of the opposite
i've heard of people trying to get
richer of course
so that that's nothing new
i don't know
i just see nothing new here
anyway when biden used the phrase new
world order you should know in context
this is also according to wikipedia
during the 20th century political
figures such as woodrow wilson and
winston churchill
used the term new world order to refer
to a new period of history characterized
by a dramatic change and often follows a
war and stuff
and i i think biden was just using it
generically
i think biden's age especially
connects him to a time when new world
order was a political thing to say that
didn't mean what it means now it wasn't
a conspiracy theory
all right how about this one the fourth
turning
how many of you are believers in uh i
guess steve bannon's big promoter of
this there's a book by that name
how many believe there's an 80 year old
natural cycle
in the world
uh in which you know different
generations act differently depending on
what situation they're born into
and that the 80-year
series
is repeated and predictable
how many by that that is telling you
something useful
and predictable the predictable part is
the important part it's easy to fit any
uh the history to any pattern do you all
know that
you could come up with any kind of weird
way to interpret things and history
usually bears it out
but it's useless if it can't predict
so hind casting is easy but then say
okay if now we understand the world we
can predict what will happen but they
can't do the predicting part
which means that the hind casting wasn't
especially
you know useful
all right
somebody says read generations the
history of american future the same
authors right as the fourth turning
but
here's my take so i did you know a
shallow dive on this
according to my shallow dive i would say
the 80-year cycle
is closer to astrology than anything to
worry about
because i think it comes down to
civilization goes through periods of
lots of change
and that war is often part of that
i mean
i'm not sure this is adding anything
because it's not predictive at all
if you tell me that the fourth turning
can predict
i tell you
anybody can predict
um sometime in the next 20 years it'll
be like a big up
what do you think
do you think i got it right
yeah probably
all right
um
that brings us to the conclusion of
the best live stream there ever has been
and if you would like to
uh
enjoy this extra
i'm going to give you a little something
extra here at the end
that will only work for twenty percent
of you
that's that's roughly the number of
people this will work for
in a moment
i'm going to tell you that your day is
going to be awesome
and then i'm gonna i'm gonna snap my
fingers
and it will become true
now for 20 of you this will actually
work
because that's about how many people are
easily persuadable
so simply having me tell you that today
is going to be great
we'll actually make it happen at least
in your subjective
movie that runs in your head
your problems might be exactly the same
you might you might not solve any
problems
but if you believe
then it'll happen
for 25 of you and so youtube
you're going to have a great day today
enjoy
