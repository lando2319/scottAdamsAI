hey everybody
come on in come on in yes it's going to
be
another terrific day how is it that we
can have a terrific day
at the same time every time i don't know
i don't know how we do it but we managed
to do it somehow
and this will be no exception another
great day starts with a simultaneous sip
and do you know what you need for the
simultaneous sip check your notes
yes you do all you need is a copper
margaret glass a tank or chelsea steiner
canteen joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope meaning
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens
now go
sublime well well well
yes i'm back into my comfort blanket
i'm considering doing two a day
uh simulcasts when we get closer to the
election here because the
country is getting a little nervous a
little bit nervous
and if things get a little too tense
maybe i'll
maybe i'll start doing my evening
broadcasts again in addition to
the morning but let's talk about all the
things
there are many things have you noticed
that the news as as fake as the news has
been
when you get close to election day the
the pretense that anybody is trying to
give you
actual news as opposed to propaganda is
just completely out the window
and i swear to god and this is not
an exaggeration this will sound like one
of those things you say because it
sounds funny
i'm not saying this to sound funny
absolutely
literal truth i watch cnn for the laughs
and it's because when they do things
that are so blatantly propaganda
propaganda as opposed to news i find it
funny
i don't know if any of you have reached
that point yet where you just sort of
turn it on and you just start laughing
and all the
you know the exaggerated ridiculousness
of it all
so yesterday i turned on cnn and there
was a story about
i'll give you i'll give you one example
so there's a story about
uh jared kushner
and they had this uh tape of him talking
to i guess woodward back in whenever he
talked to him
and i gotta find that exact quote
that i'm absolutely sure i wrote down
here it is
so this is what jared kushner said he
said
trump's now back in charge this is in a
conversation
he had back in april with woodward uh
writer woodward he goes trump's now back
in charge
it's not the doctors the first
son-in-law and white house adviser
kushner said back in april so cnn
has decided that this statement trump's
now back in charge
it's not the doctors they've decided to
do
what cnn does which is to take it out of
context
do you think that when jared kushner
said this sentence
trump's now back in charge is not the
doctor's
do you interpret it the way cnn
interprets it
to mean that he will no longer take any
advice from uh
from experts or doctors
is that your interpretation because
that just makes me laugh when i see them
say oh that means that he's not going to
look at any
any medical expertise anymore
no that doesn't say anything like that
the only way this is news is if you
willingly uh misinterpret it and you
would have to do it willingly
you this is not one of those accidental
ones because you'd have to have an iq of
about
nine to think that jared kushner
talked to bob woodward who is writing a
book
at the time or i i don't know if he was
writing it at the time but he's a
journalist
why would you tell him that the
president of the united states is going
to stop
paying attention to medical experts you
wouldn't
you wouldn't of course you wouldn't in
no
world would jared kushner do that now
remember
all the bad things that are being said
about trump you know trump is this trump
is that he's
you know he has a the mind of a child or
whatever whatever the critics are saying
nobody says that about jared nobody says
jared
kushner is dumb right
have you ever heard anybody say that
because it's
so obviously not true you know jared's
off there getting prison reform and
peace in the middle east and stuff
he's obviously a brilliant guy and so
would he ever go onto a phone call with
a journalist
who is not friendly to his boss
president trump
and father-in-law and would he ever say
that
that trump is going to start ignoring
doctors
of course not and any adult
would clearly know that's not what it
means rather it's a statement about
balance
in other words the decision won't be
made exclusively
by doctors it's going to be a
combination of all factors including the
doctors and the president
will make the decision that's all jared
said and they turned it into news
by acting as if they can't interpret
simple
you know english language so
as i was watching yesterday this is a
true story no exaggeration i turn it on
and the first story i see it might have
been this one i don't remember
was obviously not real news it was just
something they
willfully misinterpreted and i thought
well there they go again willfully
misinterpreting
something that's easy to interpret and
then the next story was
something that was only a story because
they did a fake edit
they left out part of the part of a
statement i'm like
well okay you know those are two stories
in a row
that with very little outside knowledge
is very obviously not real
and i think okay i guess all the news is
this
so i turned off the tv hours later
i turn on cnn again and it's yeah a
third story
that's completely made up based on
willfully misinterpreting again
it's like the entire network has turned
into a misinterpreting network
it doesn't matter what you do they'll
just take it the wrong way
and make a story out of it it's the
damnedest thing that we accept this as
news
but it was pretty hilarious because it's
there's a point where this stuff you you
say to yourself hey
and and i certainly said this at one
point i said hey
i think with my incredible insight
i'm picking up on the beginning of a
trend
of some of these stories are nodding not
exactly
accurate and then you think
am i the only one who's saying this then
you realize other people are saying it
you're like okay you're saying this too
right these stories are a little
a little shaded a little a little biased
a little bit
left out of context but this week as i
was saying
it's so over the top that i can't take
any of it seriously
i just laugh at it when i look at it
it's like well that's not real
okay that's not real okay that didn't
happen
and then then move on all right
here's another perfect example of fake
news
so the u.s economy grew a record it's a
record i tell you
33.1 annual rate since last quarter or
last quarter it grew that much
and of course the way cnn has to report
this headline
all right how would you if you were
going to report a headline
about incredible percentage growth in
the gdp
but you didn't want this president to
look good how would you do it
would you say the economy is surging
back
even more than we expected would you do
that
because that's that feels accurate right
economy is surging back
true and it was a little bit more than
the economist expected even
true isn't that the way you'd tell the
story
here's the headline the cnn used u.s
economy grew a record 33.1 percent
annual rate last quarter
but the pandemic remains an enormous
threat
yes they had to work the pandemic into
the headline
because the headline was too good by
itself
now is there anybody out there who was
reading the news
who did not know that there's a pandemic
going on
probably not i don't think it added much
to the knowledge of the reader
that hey by the way here's some good
news on the economy
but the pandemic the pandemic is still
going on
um a a young child was saved
from falling in a well but the pandemics
going on
um president trump got three nominations
for nobel peace prize
because peace is breaking out in the
middle east but there's a pandemic going
on pandemic
panda going on do you have to pair
there's a pandemic
going on with other news
doesn't seem like other news needs that
pairing does it
we kind of know about the pandemic by
now i've heard of it
it's a thing all right
um but here's the fake news part about
this
of course the democrats have been saying
and this is the delicious part about it
democrats have been uh mocking trump
for almost four years because
he was claiming great progress in the
economy
and then they would say the democrats
would say oh but
you know president obama had greater
percentage growth
increase in the economy during and
improvements greater increased
improvements and even unemployment
so therefore obama was better right
because he had better percentage growth
no this is news for idiots in fact
that's what they should call cnn
news for idiots you would have to be an
idiot to not know
that the reason obama had tremendous
percentage
gain is because he was coming off of a
such a low base
so it's easy to get big percentage gains
when everything has fallen apart
it's hard to get big percentage gains
when you're closer to the full recovery
which is what trump did so trump's
smaller gains
in at least percentage-wise in on in
unemployment
before the pandemic were more impressive
than obama's big gains because the big
gains are easy
they're coming off a low base and the
toward the top it's really hard to
to squeeze out any extra juice from the
lemon because you've squeezed
all you can squeeze and trump to his
credit
squeeze more lem you know juice out of
that lemon even though you didn't think
it was possible
you got he got unemployment to rates
where even economists thought
i don't even know if you can get there
so
if you are unsophisticated you think
that the
high percentage growth of one president
somehow beats the low percentage growth
of the other president
but it's only because they don't report
it with proper
proper context now that's been bugging
you for three and a half years if you're
a trump supporter it's like stop saying
that
obama had better percentage it's not the
percentage that matters
it's not you have to look at the context
to understand why that percentage is
what it is
time goes by days pass
here we are but the news comes out that
there's a record
33.1 percent increase in the gdp
should you be impressed by that
no because the context is that we're
coming off a low base
it's definitely better than if we didn't
have this high percentage increase
but this increase is completely
misleading
in terms of any kind of historical
meaning
because it's coming off a low base
exactly the credit that obama was
getting
and didn't deserve because it was just a
mathematical oddity
trump is now the beneficiary of the same
limited thinking so trump supporters
could go out there and say
33 percent gain historical never seen
that before
and it is good there's no question
that this is good news it's
unambiguously good news no doubt about
it
but it just looks like even better news
than it is
and you get to use the democrats own
trick against them
because once they've demonstrated that
the public can't tell the difference
as long as the percentage looks good
the public is like well okay that looks
good to me
do you think this situation will be
improving
the public not being able to understand
the news and context
well let me give you some new news
this is from a tweet from corey
deangelis who
you should be following he tweets a lot
about
homeschooling and the failure of the
teachers unions etc
and there's some new information out
about the 2019
results for 12th grade students
achievement in the united states
all right so this is seniors high school
seniors in the united states
37 percent of them met some standard for
reading
proficiency let me say that again
because i hope that you just said to
yourself well i must have heard that
wrong
listen to this only 37 percent
of high school seniors met the reading
proficiency level
37 i want to use the f word really badly
right now
but i'm going to hold back there's
something really broken about that
but what about math oh math will be
better right
24 of seniors met math proficiency in
the united states
24 are you kidding me
now i'll tell you what this tells me it
tells me that
we need a president cognac perhaps not
in 2020
but as i was saying in a prior live
stream
kanye is talking about building
entire communities where you design it
from
the the bottom up to fit real people
and when i say real people i mean the
people who do not have
reading proficiency the people who do
not have math proficiency
because it turns out there are more of
them than there are the other kind of
people
and if you don't start quickly
redesigning and tweaking your country so
that the
ordinary people of america can have a
good life
you're in you're on the wrong path i
mean that's eventually going to blow up
you have to redesign from scratch to
make a community
that has the kind of jobs that the
people who don't have reading
proficiency can
can do the it has the kind of expense
for a lifestyle that a low-end job
again not an insult because all work is
let me say this as clearly as possible
all work is honorable and i feel that
that's not just a
bumper sticker all work is honorable it
doesn't matter what it is
if you're contributing to to the world
to the country
to your community if you're doing
something that needed to get done
that is 100 honorable endeavor
salary aside so you need you're going to
need to build a world that has
two parts one part for people who are
you know have high education and
achievement and want to really be on
that path
which is pretty stressful but you need
people like that
and then you need another entire world
that's almost agrarian in nature
in other words in the old days he had a
bunch of people who were farmers
and they didn't need to have much
reading proficiency right
then he had other people who might have
been you know the the lawyers and
writers and politicians of the day
and the business uh owners etc and they
needed more
education well we've transfer we we've
transformed our society into one where
we're
we're telling everybody they need to
learn to code
not everybody can learn to code you know
there's a cut off level
in your i would say both ambition and
general
intelligence where you're not going to
learn to code
that's just not a thing and pretending
that everybody will learn to code
or learn to have some high-end job if
only we give them enough education
is really sort of a fool's strategy
if we want a strategy that could work i
mean even has a chance of working
it's the kanye strategy where you've got
to redesign
you've got to re-engineer your whole
situation
so that people who are ordinary people
who are good people
they just not are academically inclined
they have you know
maybe tons of skills that you and i
don't have they're just not academically
inclined
they need a life too so if we don't if
we don't make that possible
we've got big problems coming so
president kanye
someday in the future to fix that um
there's some oh let's do this story
first
so there's a there's an indication
speaking of kanye
that trump is actually within the
striking distance of winning minnesota
now if you don't follow presidential
politics much
that didn't mean too much because it's
just the state and you know you think
well
he could win that state but it's
minnesota
right minnesota should never go to a
republican
if everything you know about the world
makes sense
so the fact that i think trump has come
within the margin of error on at least
some polls
in minnesota and part of the reason is
that
kanye is pretty popular in minnesota for
some reason
i mean not for some reason he's kanye
but he's getting enough votes as a
write-in
or he might be on the ballot i forget in
minnesota
but he's actually taking enough of a
bite and a biden
that there's a non-zero chance probably
still against it's still unlikely i
think
but there's a non-zero chance that trump
of all people could win minnesota
this is a thing that might actually
happen now i'm not going to predict it
i'm just saying the fact that he's
within
breathing distance like minnesota can
feel his hot breath on the back of their
neck
that wasn't supposed to happen and it
makes you wonder if
any of our poles are reliable at this
point
all right um did you see the you
probably saw the clips of
jack dorsey uh answering questions
from senators such as senator
cruz and ron johnson were grilling jack
dorsey
and i always put myself in the position
of the person being grilled
because for some reason i always
imagined that my future would include
being grilled by congress at some point
i just feel like that's in my future and
always have
isn't that weird it it's a strange
a strange image for you know a high
school student to have but
my my entire life from an early life
i always imagined that eventually i
would be grilled by congress
for what i don't know just in my head i
just have this image that i'm the one
who was you know in the the jack dorsey
seat yesterday
i'm sure jack didn't imagine that he
would be grilled by congress one day
maybe he did who knows
um but here's what i took away from that
first takeaway is
never be on the other side of ted cruz
how would you like to be you know
testifying or whatever it's called in
front of congress
and the person who is giving you hostile
questioning is ted cruz
who is extraordinarily gifted in this
lawyerly role to the point where he's
argued in one cases at the supreme court
you don't want the pit bull who wins
cases at the supreme court
to be asking you questions in public
right so that's the first thing
and whenever i see ted cruz in that mode
i i just really appreciate him as an
american
meaning i'm glad he's on my side my side
being
america not not in this case politically
but just america
it's just good to have people who have
that level of skill
doing things that require that level of
skill
so he he's one of those people who makes
me feel confident about the republic
because you have people who are just
that much capability
so that aside
so jack dorsey came with some
suggestions ahead of time which was a
good strategy
and i i don't know if i can characterize
them right
or if i understand them completely but
among his ideas are that the
algorithm would have more transparency
as with their decision-making process
about who gets
you know banned or metered or whatever
the words are so he wants
so jack dorsey wants more transparency
within twitter
on the algorithm um
he wants an appeals process that's
straightforward
so if somebody gets banned or limited on
twitter they have a direct
human being they can go through a
process and
and get a human to decide i like that
part
there's even more provocatively you
might be able to choose your own
algorithm someday
so there might be third-party algorithms
and you get to just pick one so i'll
take the
i'll take the republican algorithm i
don't know i'm just making that one up
but they're but i like that if you get
to choose your own algorithm
then the algorithms are competing
against each other in a way
so maybe that's good maybe maybe the
free market can fix
things that were not clever enough to
fix directly
um and then uh he says
jack dorsey says that twitter should
publish its moderation
practices so that you know exactly what
they do and why
now uh here's here's the part where i
i was imagining myself in the receiving
end of this grilling because they went
at him pretty hard
so ron johnson was um
was grilling jack about did they know
that the new york post article that they
banned on twitter did they know it
wasn't true
and you know jack said no
that they did not know it wasn't true
but it got banned anyway
now here's the part that i wished i had
been in
jack's seat when ron johnson was
grilling him ron was
doing this thing where he pretends as if
jack dorsey had not already very
publicly said
oh that was a mistake we should not have
done that
we have corrected it right so he's he's
confessed
with no ambiguity right no there's no
but if nothing like that he just said
clear
unambiguous mistake so we fixed it
quickly
that's not much to complain about right
if you if a ceo says that was a mistake
we fixed it in 24 hours i don't care
what the mistake is
unless somebody's dying or something
that's pretty good
right that's pretty good but ron johnson
does this
angry questioning that makes the viewer
think
that that sequence hadn't already
happened and jack
being you know the polite smart ceo that
he was just sort of sits there and
listens to
it and then just sort of softly
responds that they had you know
confessed that and taking care of it but
i really wished i had been in that chair
because i would have been a lot more
aggressive
about responding to that i think i would
have said
something closer to i don't know exactly
what everyone said but something closer
to
well you know senator we've already said
that that was a mistake and corrected it
is there something else we should do to
go back to the past
we're kind of focused on the future here
but if you'd like to talk about the
things we all agree about
we all agree that that shouldn't have
happened but i hope that you're happy
that we corrected it in 24 hours
and i hope that you're happy that we're
here coming with some legitimate
suggestions for how to make things
better
but if you'd like to talk about the
things we agree about
that that was not the right decision but
we quick we fix
fixed it quickly i'd like to spend some
more time on that because
i think the public should know how
quickly we responded to that
yeah somebody's somebody in the comments
is saying quickly
quickly in 24 hours i think that was
what jack said
now my understanding is that is it true
that the new york post
account is still frozen so somehow i'm
maybe not understanding the issue
as well as i should because i don't know
what it was they changed in 24 hours
because i think the account is still
locked but i need a fact check on that
anyway the the the larger point is that
there are some
seemingly pretty good ideas for fixing
things
if they could actually be implemented i
think they also need to get in and jail
free
not free but get in a jail process where
somebody who's been banned
permanently can maybe wait three years
or
pick a number and that after three years
there should be some
independent board that decides whether
they should come back
i would like to volunteer should there
ever be a an appeals board
for twitter bad behavior and you need uh
relatively independent people to decide
whether
it is worthy of bringing them back i
would volunteer for that
so and i think i don't think anybody
should do more than say
a one-year term or something but i would
do one year of a term
as a relatively you know and you have to
say relatively because there's nobody
who's unbiased
you can't really get all the way to
unbiased but you could imagine
groups of people such as i'll just throw
on some names
tim poole if tim poole were one of the
people
with a one year term with some other
people
to decide whether people should be
brought back onto twitter
after whatever bad behavior and some
time has passed
when you trust him you'd say oh yeah he
is completely capable
of seeing a left opinion and a right
opinion and and judging appropriately
i feel like i'm in that category i feel
like you could probably come up with
another half dozen names pretty quickly
of people who would not be universally
loved
by left or right but at least you look
at them and you say yeah
maybe i don't love that one choice but i
see what you're doing
you know with the other say five people
or whatever there are
i see what you're going for you're going
for people who at least
have demonstrated they have the
capability
of taking the other side's point of view
sometimes
i'm seeing some other names on here i
see jimmy dore i don't
don't know enough about him to know if
that
is real so somebody in the comments is
saying that
jack fixing it is fake news now
you have to worry that any proposed
solutions are not genuine
right i mean that's a reasonable thing
to worry about
and i don't think there's any way to
know until you see actual
implementation as i say often ideas are
worthless
because everybody has ideas ideas are
free you want some ideas i got seven of
them
i just thought of just now ideas are
free
but implementation is kind of hard and
rare and valuable
so if twitter can implement
and we can observe it the things which
they're talking about that would be
i think these would be real solutions
they look genuine
in in the sense that they're the right
kinds of things
but you have to wait for the
implementation that is correct
all right the other fun thing is that uh
in 2018 there was this big article and
then it was a book
uh but the article was written by an
anonymous source
who was allegedly a high-level
white house person who was saying bad
things about the president
and alleged that people were doing
things behind the president's back
meaning the staff to try to thwart him
in his bad ways
and there was lots of guessing at the
time of who wrote it and nobody knew
but we now know it's somebody named
miles taylor
former dhs chief of staff and of course
the
the big story here is that he was not
exactly or
not even close to being a senior staff
member
and he was rarely or never
in the room with the president and in
fact
senior staff members would not
necessarily even know he existed
so that's that's the level of seniority
he had which is
the senior people probably never met him
you know didn't know his name but he was
sort of oversold
by the context and the new york times i
would say
as being a little bit higher up than he
was so he's come forward
and of course he had lied on cnn when
they asked him if he was anonymous
and he said flat out now and then
chris cuomo asked him about that
and miles taylor said that he his
reasoning
and that he had actually said in the
document or the book i think he said
that if he had been asked he would lie
because what he wanted to do was make
sure that it wasn't personal
in other words he he didn't become the
subject of the attacks
his explanation is he wanted the focus
to be on
the points he was making not on him
personally and that he would be the
subject of insults and then it would
divert from his point
so do you think he had a point
that if we knew who he was that he would
be insulted
and that the attention would go toward
those insults
yeah he was right about that
because as soon as i saw him i thought
man
he's one frat boy douchebag looking guy
with a little
a little bit too much hair and that's
what the first thing i thought about him
is like
god what a douchebag this guy is so
did anybody else insult him let's see
white house press secretary kelly
mcinerney
said in a statement wednesday after
taylor's identity was revealed
quote this low-level disgruntled former
stafford is a staffer
is a liar and coward who chose anonymity
over action and leaking over leading
so maybe he had a little bit of a point
there
it turned it turns out that the focus is
on him now
and most of that focus is insulting
his level of authority his looks and my
case
and it's funny that i'm making fun of
his looks because he's
you know
unambiguously he's a good looking guy
and he's better looking than i am
but he does have sort of a frat boy
douchebag look
i can't take that away from him all
right uh
and he wrote stuff like he thought that
trump's team was
trying to sabotage him and stuff anyway
once you realize who it is
you just you just start thinking to
yourself uh oh it's just a disgruntled
employee
and then you put it in context um
here's the funniest part of the story
and the payoff
so cnn reports
and and finally this is real news
they report that this guy is a
uh public liar because he lied on cnn
to cnn so we don't have to wonder if he
will lie in public
he's actually famous for it because he
lied to cnn and they even they called
him out
and then they hired him so now he works
for cnn
so cnn reports that he is a
public liar and then they hired him
and i'm thinking well he's kind of
perfect
he's kind of perfect and i realized that
i think i could get a job
as cnn if i could learn to lie a little
bit better
and become kind of known for it then i'd
get myself a job i'll be up there with
clapper and you know all the rest of the
liars
all right here's the weirdest the
weirdest story
tucker carlson has a story about being
in los angeles
to talk to tony babalinsky the
biden x business partner who is
whistleblowing on him
and he asked for a trove of new
documents implicating
joe biden's shady dealings to be mailed
to him by some
you know overnight service and the
documents were stolen
in the process the the container the box
showed up but it was empty and the
documents were stolen
now i have to think that whoever
provided the documents kept a copy so i
don't think we have to worry about that
information not existing somewhere
but you do have to wonder about who had
the wherewithal and the capability to
know what was in that
package and to get it
that's it's scary if anybody had that
capability
and if it was a random crime it's the
weirdest random crime there ever was
and if it wasn't random it's really
scary
all right um
given the gigantic difference between
male
and female voters and their preferences
for trump versus biden
in your mind does it feel like this
election is the boys against the girls
i'm just wondering if it's starting to
feel like that to you
because you there's lots of ways to
frame this you could say it's democrats
versus republicans it's it's a liberals
versus conservatives
so there are a million ways that you
could say what it is
but to me it's really devolved into the
boys against the girls
because the girls are firmly in charge
and here i mean women and men not boys
and girls but
the the women are firmly in charge in
the democratic side i would say
and it seems that there's more of a male
vibe
of course there are both men and women
in both cases
but almost as if there's a testosterone
difference
because i'm not the first one to to note
this
that uh and there's no other there's no
uh
there's no non-insulting sounding way to
say what i'm gonna say
so just trust me that i'm not saying
this to be insulting
i'm saying it as an observation if it
sounds insulting i can't help it
democrats are largely beta males and
women
and the exception being uh
a lot of black men who in large numbers
seem
to be moving to trump because to me that
was the one thing that didn't make sense
uh you know because there were a lot of
black men who you would not say are beta
males
and i kept thinking i feel like they're
in the wrong party
it just feels it feels like that's not
really the fit
forget about policy forget about who's
done what for who over the years forget
about any of that it just
it just seemed like apples and oranges a
little bit and so i'm not surprised even
a little bit
that there's movement toward trump and
the black community
and primarily the men because i think
there is a real male female
vibe that's forming completely
unconsciously
and uh yeah the the the democrat
men who are comfortable in a female-led
organization tend to be a certain
certain characteristic now of course
these are gross generalities and
there are millions of exceptions and i'm
not saying that
i'm not saying that there aren't manly
men in the democratic party and i'm not
saying that there aren't
you know every type in the republican
party but i feel like
you know the trend and the gravity and
the weight
is starting to separate in that way and
that if you thought of it
if you thought of it in the past as more
of a
an ethnic thing like the democrats or
the
let's say the non-white or more
plurality
more diversity if that's what you were
thinking
it's true but i feel like it's mostly
now
female versus male like that's the
dominant
theme that's starting to emerge but
isn't fully emerged
but it feels like it's starting to
emerge that way
there's of course you've heard that
there's uh coronavirus is
breaking out we've got some more
infections in the united states but
europe is having a tough time
so they're getting a big second wave we
think that'll hit the united states too
so we're not going to gloat over that
but
there's some thinking and this is very
non-confirmed
more likely not true than true but it's
worth talking about
which is that the coronavirus seems to
have mutated
in europe anyway and spain which is
having a big problem with the flare-up
has mostly the mutation kind so it's the
the new version of the coronavirus is
what a
big part of the the surges in europe
and some people are saying oh maybe the
new one
is a little extra catchy maybe it's
worse
other people are saying there's no
indication of that
it might be just different doesn't mean
it's worse could be just
you know a minor evolution but it's
basically the same thing it just looks a
little different
but i wonder if we've developed
and this is just me talking this is
nobody who knows what they're talking
about talking this is just me
and i don't know what i'm talking about
it makes me wonder
just a hypothesis if we had reached
something closer to herd immunity to the
first version
and that without the second version
maybe we wouldn't see
as much of a a second wave now obviously
there's a seasonality to it
that will definitely have an impact but
maybe it wouldn't be as big a second
wave
if not for the uh the mutation i think
the experts are still betting against
that
and they're probably right but i just
want to put that out there
you know if you're trying to figure out
if i observe the world
what model makes everything make sense
and while this might not be true
what would make sense is that the
you know the the deaths were going down
even as the infections were going up
would indicate that maybe some
percentage of the public
has a natural immunity beyond just being
young
and that maybe we had started reaching
the edge of that
you know group of people who were
susceptible and that you had to have
a mutation to get more people it could
be that the mutation is important but
we'll find out
i i was still i was still bad against it
being important
but not impossible uh more terror
attacks in france
uh two more terror attacks within hours
of each other
three people killed two more of them
beheaded
so this beheading thing is turning into
a
little mini trend in france
and here's a question that
i think nasim talib wrote about once
and it is how many uh
how many islamic citizens do you need
before your country is guaranteed to
become islamic
yeah as a dominant theme
what do you think is the percentage um
and i don't know what the percentage is
in the united states under five percent
i guess but in france what's the
percentage
i don't know the percentage but i think
the percentage is lower than you think
um i think it's lower than you think
i think that and i think this was talib
talking about this
that somewhere around 15
if you have a 15 islamic
citizenship that you're pretty much
guaranteed to become a
islamic country and the thinking beyond
that is that they have a superior system
so it's the system it's not the belief
and the system
involves that you can't leave yes it's
tough to leave you could be
killed if you leave if you leave the
faith
so islamic islam is sticky and
a little bit more aggressive so there's
some thought that if you give 15
citizenship of or at least residents
uh islamic that is all going to go
islamic and i think france is there
right
am i wrong i think france is at that
limit or close to it
which would suggest that france will
become an islamic
country and i would say that they're
heading that way if i had to bet
i would bet france will become islamic
if i had to put money on it
but i don't it's not next year i mean
it's going to take a while
but i would bet that there will be an
islamic
country and say one generation
um the lapd got approval to do
to begin recording video footage from
their helicopters
above protesters now i don't know how
much difference that's going to make
because the protesters mostly have masks
but that's kind of chilling isn't it
they'll have video of all the protesters
obviously they'll be using facial
recognition
there's reports they already have them
they'll use more of it i'm sure
i'm not too concerned about this story
when everybody's wearing masks because i
don't think it's going to make that much
difference
but i like i like where it's going
because the protests only work
because they have safety in numbers and
you know they they all dress
at least the people dress alike with the
black block
clothing and so they can get away with
stuff
every time you add a little bit more uh
let's say transparency to what's going
on which is what the video
would do fewer people are going to be
bold enough to
to take that chance so i think that's a
good step in terms of law and order
and maybe a step in the wrong direction
for civil
liberties but something had to give
right you couldn't go forever letting
the protesters do whatever they want
that wasn't an option and if the only
way to stop them
involves a little uh a little hit to our
civil liberties
well you only had two options right
all right um
here's uh i'd like to wrap this up with
a little uh
lesson on success are you ready
a lesson on success there are lots of
ways to be successful
some of them involve luck and
inheritance and crime and
those things and some of them are just
hard work and being smart and staying
out of jail
and those are good but there are more
um let's say uh subtle
and unique and useful ways to be
successful
and i've been modeling one of them in
front of you for the last several years
and i want to put some words to it
one of the things i talk about all the
time is a b
testing where you just try something see
if it works and then quickly try
something else to see if that's better
until you sort of test your way to
success
you've seen me try to transfer or
evolve from cartoonist to whatever this
is
political pundit or whatever live
streaming is i don't know if it has a
career name to it but what you've
watched is from the beginning
i started very small with small risk and
just i literally on day one i picked up
my phone
and said i'd like to know more about
this periscope thing
just to know more about it i felt like
that was something my talents that
needed
so i started just periscoping with my
phone in my hand
and the quality was terrible and i think
you know a dozen people showed up the
first time
but i learned something and then i
thought huh maybe i'll do this again
and i kept experimenting up uh buying
studio equipment experimenting with
sound
researching video i bought a number of
different expensive
devices like that there's a 13 000
device
over my shoulder here for studio
production
etc now none of the expensive equipment
worked
and when i say worked i don't mean it
was broken
i mean that for what i wanted to
accomplish it didn't work
and here's what i mean my other
requirement
and these are some of my principles for
success and we'll put them all together
so principle number one is experimenting
your way continuously
so you're never done experimenting it's
just every day
boom boom boom boom you're always
experimenting so
i've experimented with my setup and my
technology until i have this set up
which i believe is the best i can get to
while maintaining my other principles
which i'll talk about in a minute
so right now i've got motorized curtains
which
is huge so i can do a blackout of all my
light
i've got two ring lights facing the
walls
so i'm getting indirect light and i'm
using two ipads
together clipped together with a potato
chip
bag clip so that they don't fall off the
stand
and so i have two live streams going
youtube and periscope simultaneously on
two ipads
that are both in front of me here now i
tried
every complicated technology to do what
i'm doing right now
and you could get better quality you
could get better video
you'd have to record it to do that live
streaming is a lower resolution
um and you could get better sound you
know with full production things but
you'd have to soundproof the room etc
and here's what i would lose if i went
to the higher level of quality
number one it wouldn't be fun anymore
because i like the content and the
getting ready for it i like the
experience i love actually being
live on the live stream it's partly why
i do it
because i like it and i wouldn't enjoy
it if i had to spend an
hour every morning reloading my software
and testing and rebooting and that's
what you do with the complicated systems
you need either a full-time engineer or
a techie
who works with you the whole time and
then you're managing people
it's not what i wanted to do i don't
want to manage people
i want to just do this i just want to
talk to you
and so i managed but through testing to
get to the quality
up to the point where these these simple
lavalier microphones i've got two of
them one for each ipad
and the ipad quality and the lighting
etc were good enough
for live streaming in a way that youtube
would say oh these videos are high
enough quality
could be better but they're high enough
quality that we can
you know promote them etc so once i
reached a certain level
and it was live streamed instead of
recorded because what i used to do is
take the periscope and upload it onto
youtube but it was lower quality and
took longer so
um yes and it wouldn't be as personal i
didn't want this to be
a slick production so here were the
other requirements
it had to be dead simple so that i could
do it myself
because as soon as you add an assistant
in the room
it's just the chemistry is wrong and
then i'm managing people
and they've got problems and they didn't
show up today and
they've got a question but i'm trying to
think of what i'm going to say
but now i'm drawn into the technical
problem because i need to answer a
question
right so a b testing
develop your talent stack relentlessly
in other words
the the several talents it takes to do
what i'm doing now
i had to assemble over time learn
lighting
learn sound learn learn live stream
learn how the algorithm works in youtube
learn how to promote it learn how to
upload it learn yeah
there's a lot but you just keep
keep edging up keep building that talent
stack
keep a b testing continuously never stop
i'm not done now by any means i'll keep
going and
and there you are and then the last part
is getting lucky
because luck is kind of required for
success
because if you don't have good luck you
might have bad luck
and that's not going to help you so how
do you make
luck happen if you don't have direct
control over
you know the universe and the way that
you make luck happen is you go where the
energy is
and you practice in public and you wait
that's it if you go where the energy is
you're going to find more luck for
example when i
graduated from college i was in a very
small town in upstate new york
and so i knew that there wouldn't be
much luck you could call it opportunity
but i'm going to call it luck i'm not
going to run into people that could
you know help me someday i'm not going
to accidentally
be part of a startup i need to go where
there's
energy so i moved to california that was
the first thing i did after college
because i wanted to be where luck could
happen
and that was a good play in this case i
moved
to the the more dynamic video
field so it was obvious that
uh live streaming and video is the big
growing thing
so you go where the energy is and you
have more chance of getting lucky
because there's just more stuff
happening
and then if you can
stay in business long enough and
certainly
i was it wasn't like i was making money
or anything from doing this
for the first three years but i didn't
go out of business
in other words it wasn't anything to
make me stop doing it
i could just keep getting better and
wait for some luck to happen
and then some luck happened it came in
the in the
form of this uh election of course
it's not lucky it was scheduled but the
election makes all the live streaming
stuff on this topic go crazy so all my
numbers went through the roof
because it's the right topic at the
right time but also the coronavirus
the coronavirus obviously is not luck
for the world
but it caused live streaming and this
form of
entertainment to just you know zoom in
importance
no pun intended and so i'm in the right
place at the right time but not by luck
i engineered very consciously a move
from a sleepy world of cartooning to a
dynamic
visible world where luck could find me
and luck is finding me all over the
place so those are your
your tips go where it's dynamic where
luck can find you
a b test continuously to improvement
build your still skill stack over time
if you do those three things
your odds of something good happening in
a few years
you know not year one but in a few years
is really good it's exactly the same
process i used for building
dilbert and for other things that have
worked out
so that is your tip for the day
somebody says in the comments lucky guy
definitely there's luck
there is definite luck but i would say
that anybody who did
what i did meaning pursuing the energy
building a talent stack
a b testing if you do those three things
luck is going to find you and that is
all
for today i'll talk to you tomorrow
