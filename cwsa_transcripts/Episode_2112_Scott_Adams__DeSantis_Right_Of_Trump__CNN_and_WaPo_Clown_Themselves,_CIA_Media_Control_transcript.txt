to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization I
like to call it coffee with Scott Adams
and it is the best thing that ever
happened in your entire life
if you'd like to make it even better
than that hard to believe I know but all
you need to do that would be a cover of
my girl glass of tanker chalices done a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine together the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and wow
does it make you healthier and sexier
and better looking and probably will
increase your lifespan
and it happens now go
ah
um
well let's check out the news
to get you on your way today make sure
your day is perfect
because you know all the stuff and you
know all the way to think about it
uh so big news is uh DeSantis is
apparently going to announce next week
he's running for president
and the news is reporting
um she then says this anyway that uh
he's going to run to the right
of trump
do you think that makes sense
DeSantis is going to run to the right of
trump
um I'm not sure I believe it so I guess
he can get to the right on two issues
one is guns and one is abortion
so he's a little extra in both those
categories gun freedom and uh yeah well
coven wasn't mentioned in the news but I
think you could throw that in there
here's my
non-political expert take
isn't the only benefit of DeSantis is
that he would seem more normal to other
voters
isn't that that pretty much all you get
it's the only thing you get
it's like Trump without the drama
and in order to run for president to
beat Trump he has to be more Trump than
Trump
that feels like exactly the opposite of
his value proposition
I I get that you have to run to you know
you go right when you're running for uh
the nomination but
he's a special case his entire appeal is
that he's not trump-like entirely you
know with with the extreme stuff
I don't know it seems like the very
worst thing he could do I feel like it's
a gigantic waste of time
and he's just distracting from what good
work he could do in Florida for the next
four years or next couple years I guess
until he loses the primary now the thing
that makes me wonder
is does DeSantis know something we don't
know
for example
would DeSantis know that there's some
big trouble coming down the down the
road for Trump that we don't know about
I feel like everything must be out by
now but there are always surprises
otherwise it just seems like a bad idea
but I think we have to wait and see
given that DeSantis has a pretty long
history of doing smart things
the fact that we can't see this as smart
immediately that you would run to the
right of trump
doesn't mean it isn't it might mean
there's some extra information we're not
aware of so I'm going to wait
I guess that doesn't wait and say
because at this point it's based on
rumor it's not really reporting
so that would be interesting I think his
best chance would be to run as a normal
Republican
he could just say that
I'm going to run as a normal person if
you like a normal president for a while
did you see Elon Musk when he was asked
if he's happy that he voted for Biden
and he took a long pause
and he said avoiding the question
I just want a normal president it's not
too much to ask just a normal one
I just want a normal human being
so DeSantis could fit that
pocket perfectly
DeSantis is about the you know his
biggest
his biggest Advantage is that he's not
interesting
he's normal
right
now normal in a good way because
Republicans like you know good solid
citizens who get to work on
it's not a bad idea but he's not
exciting so we'll see
uh I saw a tweet by uh Benjamin Carlson
you found a clip from 1983 of some CIA
agent being interviewed and the CIA
agent was talking about the degree to
which they manipulate the media
and it's pretty big degree
so apparently the CIA forms
relationships with reporters
in which the CIA uh
ask them for information because the CIA
is both gathering information but also
planting misinformation so in the
Gathering of information they have a
reason to talk to reporters because
reporters know things before you know
you do so the CIA wants to know things
as soon as possible so they they know
all the big reporters but also they give
stories to reporters
and this was just a for example number
it's not a not a studied number but the
agent was saying you know you give you
give your contact five real stories
that makes them look like Superstars and
they use that for let's say four real
ones and then the fifth one you slip in
is misinformation
and they're going to print it because
they trusted you on the other four and
maybe it's unclear whether the next one
is even true or not
but they still trusted you so they
printed it so one way that they co-opt
them
said the CIA guy now again this is just
a video on the internet
but it sounds true
even if the guy isn't really a CIA guy
the things he said are so obviously
probably true I mean they just ring so
ordinary that it sounds pretty credible
and the other thing he says is it's not
always that we're just being helpful to
the reporters and we have a relationship
with them that's not the only way they
persuade them but they also look for
their human weaknesses
whatever that means whatever that means
it sounds a little black malish you know
maybe it's not blackmail maybe it's more
incentive than blackmail I don't know
but uh but they're very much in the
business of influencing the news and not
toward truth
and
uh I think there was one study that
showed that CIA CIA influenced 400
journalists
I think that was according to Woodward
and Bernstein
Woodward and Bernstein studied it found
out that the CIA was basically
manipulating a lot of journalists
so do you believe the news
the the news is completely artificial
and and always has been is just a little
more we're a little bit smarter about it
now and they're now more like two sides
so one side is always willing to point
out the fake news on the other side
so I don't think it's worse
I do not think that the fake news is
worse
I think it's always been this way we
just didn't know it now we know it
so I mean maybe it's worse but it was
about as bad as you could imagine it
being back in the 80s and earlier
60s I believe I think we have
confirmation that the CIA has been
active since at least the 60s
it influenced the media
um
RFK Jr I was listening to him on the all
in podcast and he was talking about
Ukraine and what he would do to stop it
and
I guess this is all stuff I've heard
before but when you hear someone running
for president say it it takes on a whole
different meaning and he talks about uh
the war in Ukraine being I'm going to
try to paraphrase it as fairly as I can
then it's the military industrial
complex
looking for a reason for war
along with the neocons who want to
remove Putin for power because that's
what they do and they've always wanted
to do that
and that the whole uh we're protecting
Ukraine none of us real
the entire war is just a fake front
for what the U.S wanted to do which is
go to war with Russia without getting
killed
so apparently Biden and the neocons
found a way to go to war with Russia
without the enormous risk of getting
nuked in the process
and that they really are
just trying to drain Russia resources
and get Putin out of power
and they're acting that way they're
saying it it's just obvious
and we're sitting here the American
public and we're acting like well
you know I guess I guess there's they're
going to ban you
abandon the people who say Scott is just
catching up or just waking up
because that's not happening
but boom you are hidden
all right
um
uh is there somebody there who thinks
that I just became cynical lately
like who thinks I'm just waking up
are you serious I've been doing the
Dilbert comic for 34 years which
is nothing but doubting people in power
are telling you the truth that's all it
is
and do you really think I'm just like
figuring it out now that everybody in
power has been lying to us forever
I thought I was telling you
in case just in case there was somebody
who didn't know you think I'm just
realizing it now just waking up
all right you must be new
anyway seeing uh RFK Jr not only say
that the CIA killed his father uh
probably his father but certainly his
uncle
um
but also that the entire Ukraine Russia
war is a big fake thing there's no
no American interest
and we're just using all our treasure
and for no reason and that all of
the provocation Is Us basically we made
a bunch of promises to Russia which
probably would have held
and then we broke all of our promises
and did everything provocative and
dangerous looking and tried as hard as
we could to overthrow Putin
what the is he supposed to do
like what did we expect Putin to do
well here we are so I'm I think maybe we
did expect them to do this because they
wanted him to be in a war and they
wanted to drain him and they want to
sell a lot of weapons and
our government is not working for us
right now you know that right
it doesn't look like the government has
even a little bit of interest in the
American people
certainly not the Ukrainian people
so
anyway so that's happening
um I think when I when you hear RFK Jr
talk about this stuff it's hard not to
like him
it's hard not to like and once again I
saw another journalist go after him for
his vaccination views
but couldn't do it with data
they they just it was so illegitimate
you know here's how they handle it
um you've been criticized for your
vaccine statements uh you've said lots
of things that people think are crazy
and nutty and unscientific we don't have
time to talk about all that but I'd like
to ask you about
and I'm like I actually saw that
somebody challenged him on the most
important question and said but we don't
have time to talk about that
and he's sitting there like the
he just threw me under the bus and said
I don't have time to crawl back out
but like while you're filming
it was it was a crystal ball yeah I
think it was yeah you saw this you saw
the same thing I saw right she threw him
under the bus and said there's no time
for you to respond
and he's just sitting there like what
now
somebody mentioned that he was being
steamrolled in that interview
here's the problem with his voice issue
Trump would not have been steamrolled
because he would have talked over her
because he's got a big booby voice he
would have just talked over her and as
she kept talking he would have just kept
talking over her and that she couldn't
complained that he was talking over her
he would just talk over her
right Trump would have just annihilated
her in that interview but it's because
he's big and he has a big voice
um
when you've got a faltering voice you
can't do that
you just don't have the sword you know
you're you're trying to poke but there's
none there
so that's a real disadvantage for him in
interviews but he's still strong
like overall I mean I you it was obvious
he was being screwed by the the
interviewer so I took his side just sort
of automatically because he was
obviously being screwed so
I think he's still completely effective
but that is one area he's got to work
you know work around that
um all right
I saw a video of some Tesla robots
walking around and being trained
and I feel like this might be the
biggest thing that's coming
but because musk is Musk he never talks
about the robots does he
when was the last time you heard musk
bring up on his own
Tesla robots are coming
like actual walking talking robots
it's sort of it's weirdly
not discussed now I suppose it's yeah
move to investors of course but I have a
feeling this could be his biggest Market
what do you think
I think robots could be
60 of all of his Revenue fairly soon
because
if he makes the best robot it's going to
be the iPhone of robots
right I you know maybe Apple has one too
but here's our full-size robots it looks
like I don't know how tall they are they
look like
you know they're five foot ten or
something
and it looks like they'll have you know
full articulation and they'll be able to
feel sensitive things you know they can
put their foot on an egg I saw a
demonstration without breaking the egg
and
the other thing that you think about is
how do you think Mars could possibly be
colonized
unless you had really good
solar solar stuff and batteries and
robots
don't you think he's going to ship a
bunch of robots to Mars and then the
robots
will independently build up a
environment for humans later
that's the obvious thing to do right
like there's no chance that won't happen
is there I mean assuming the robots are
capable it looks like they might be now
I don't know if the robots could handle
the elements
so there might be some problem with that
but if you had enough robots they could
have spare parts and they could be you
know repairing each other and Reporting
back and building out your little
environment and Geo engineering and all
that stuff in fact you could have robots
developing Mars for a hundred years
before the pers first person went there
to live permanently
I feel like that's where it's going
isn't that the obvious Direction put the
robots up there and have them build us a
planet so we can go there when we're
ready
it's just the the stuff that musk does
is so insanely futuristic that you can't
even hold it in your head sometimes like
you so he's so far ahead and and
accurately so far he's anticipated where
the world will go before it gets there
all right
um and then these robots will all be AI
of course they'll be walking and talking
and forming relationships with them you
know we will
there will be strap-ons for robots
oh my god there will be strap-ons for
robots
you know that's going to happen right
I don't think it'll be part of the
original equipment but there's going to
be this aftermarket
it's like you know where your robot
needs how about a uh a realistic mask a
realistic mask you can pull over its
robot head that looks like somebody you
know
like you could have an atom Schiff robot
just so you could abuse it
or it could look like you're you're
deceased spouse or something like that
but there's going to be this aftermarket
for accessorizing your robot and uh
definitely could be a strap-on that's
coming
so
I am so curious about a speaking of musk
a tweet he made about sorrows
when he said uh you to somebody said you
assume they're good intentions they are
not talking about George soros's
intentions and he says mus says of Soros
he wants to erode the very fabric of
civilization Soros hates Humanity
what is that based on
do you think it's because musk has
inside information about
uh about sorrows
I don't think so
now here here's the problem
don't we all believe that uh George
soros's son is really the active person
in charge
don't we all believe that
so wouldn't that assume that the father
is evil
but somehow it was genetically or by
training passed down to the Sun
and the reason that we think Soros might
be evil
is a he might have been you know damaged
by something in his past which goes to
musk's comment that he reminds him of
Magneto Magneto had a backstory of being
in a Jewish prisoner of war camp in
World War II and Soros has a you know
World War II Jewish backstory so mosque
was suggesting
there might be something in the
backstory of Soros that makes him hate
Humanity because he did go through it
and experience that you could reasonably
think would make you hate Humanity
that's not a scratch but it is a stretch
to say that it was passed down to the
Next Generation
because clearly the people around Soros
are on the same page have you ever heard
anybody said we're trying to talk
sorosana doing this stuff
all the people who get money from Source
think they're doing good things
they think
or well they say they are
so I do not I don't think this the facts
support
that Soro senior
uh was injured and you know let's say
psychologically by his past experience
and therefore he hates humanity is
trying to destroy it
how does that fit with the fact that his
son is the one who's running the show
and apparently on board with all of it
and the son didn't experience any of
those things
how is it passed on by training
or is where senior really in charge
you know I don't I just don't think the
senior is ever really in charge at that
age
it just doesn't feel like a thing
well you think the sun is just sort of
going along with it or he's brainwashed
see the trouble is you you have to reach
for some pretty sketchy hypotheses
is it possible that the sun is just
brainwashed yes
it's not the most likely thing
is it possible that the sun
coincidentally has the same feelings
while having a completely different
experience
I suppose but it would be really unusual
right
the the most normal explanation of
what's going on
is that the father sorrows
doesn't know exactly where his money's
going and what's happening or you know
he's got some cognitive dissonance which
is preventing him from seeing it or
they're just not telling him I mean I
assume he reads the news
so to me some ordinary explanation makes
more sense
like somebody's really old and doesn't
know where his money's going or or he
gave it to organizations that look good
but turned out not to be good
ordinary things
but this whole uh he's evil and that
evil was transferred to his son his
family and all the people in the Soros
organization
now I'm sorry that's too far it's too
far I my imagination is good but I can't
I can't stretch it that far
now do Gates see do you not notice the
pattern
that if they're a billionaire and
they're doing things that that they say
are good for the world but you don't
like them
you don't say they're wrong
you say they're evil and they want to
destroy the world
just can you hear yourself
can you actually hear yourself
if you heard somebody else say that
you'd say they were crazy
right
oh it's all the billionaires are evil
and want to destroy the Earth
well isn't that a coincidence you've
never met one person in your entire life
who actually wanted to harm the Earth am
I right you've never met one in your
whole life you've never met one person
who legitimately wanted to destroy the
world
but all these billionaires do right
yeah as soon as you're a billionaire you
want to destroy the world
just hear yourself
just hear yourself
now I know somebody's going to interpret
this as defending Soros does anybody
think I'm defending sorrows
does this does this sound to you like
defending him
no because the outcomes are terrible we
just don't know why the outcomes are
terrible
right I I would damn him as much as the
rest of you for what he's doing with the
district attorneys but I don't know why
to say you know why is a little stretch
all right
but
uh we're built we're built to give
ourselves reasons when there are no
reasons so I understand it Montana is
the first state to ban tick tock not not
just for government officials
but for any user who's a resident
of Montana
what do you think of that
now of course it'll be challenged
of course
so Tick-Tock will challenge maybe the I
don't know UCLA not use
what are they called uh is that useless
organization
um ACLU yes ACLU they might try to
oppose it why
the hell if I know
but I don't I don't have a ton of
optimism
that with this one state movement is
going to become a Cascade it could there
are other states might say well
let's try that too maybe
um
well I believe the way they would do it
is
since you have to buy it in the App
Store
I think the App Store would check the
zip code of your credit card
and if your ZIP code is in the band
state it just wouldn't let you do it I
think
does that sound like I think you could
do that you could use a VPN
don't know how many people know how to
do that
kids probably do it'll probably take 10
minutes for the kids to get a VPN
wouldn't it
but wait a minute does the VPN work if
you're buying from the Apple Store
does it
the VPN will work if you're in Montana
so the Apple Store won't know you're in
won't know where you are
or who you are
do you think let me ask you will the
Apple Store let you buy something
without putting in your address
I don't know that they will they will
you don't think that your credit card
has an address and file with Apple
yeah apple knows a lot about you I think
they know it where you are and what
state you're in and where you live
I don't think your VPN is shielding you
from Apple
Apple knows you on the phone
Apple knows the identity of the person
who owns the phone period
I'm not wrong about that
now so I think I think that you could
ban it like 80 you know 20 would find
workarounds but I think you could ban it
80 percent
which would be substantial
all right
well we'll see
so yesterday the news there were a bunch
of rumors that are being debunked about
change up in the Fox News lineup and the
Rumor which is I think debunked because
Fox News says there's nothing to it
was that Laura Ingram was going to be
out no indication of that
um and that they were gonna
fill that let's see Hannity to Tucker's
time period and then Jesse Waters would
be after Hannity and then Garfield would
be moved to 10 o'clock now that was the
rumor
and Fox News says no no we're just
considering lots of possibilities and no
decisions have been made
but that is also what corporations say
when the rumors get out right
when the rumor gets out the best way to
deny is well it's one of the things that
came up
it's just one of the things one of the
possibilities but we haven't made any
decisions
um so it came from the The Drudge Report
do you remember when drudge was
important
and then I guess it got sold and turned
into something I don't know what it is
but
as of today that doesn't look like
that's a confirmed rumor so keep an eye
on that that's my phrase for the day
let's keep an eye on that we'll Circle
back to that
all right uh CNN speaking of their
lineup Caitlin Collins who did that town
hall with Trump uh is going to take the
9 pm hour
as CNN
which is a prestigious hour
and uh so she's basically getting
promoted
uh right after her Town Hall performance
which was widely criticized but not her
I don't think she was criticized it was
CNN that got criticized
yeah I thought she did a good job I
tweeted that twice
I think this is smart
it's fun to watch Chris light the new
head
try to navigate the impossibility of
turning CNN into an honest organization
but he's he's put into work
at the very least he's trying some stuff
right he's he's being provocative
he is a violating expectations these are
all good things uh he's got her
attention
you know he got got a lot of Republicans
to tune in at least once
and Caitlyn Collins somebody mentions
this she's 31.
is that the youngest
person to have a show like that have
they ever had anybody who was 31
who had a major hosting job or am I
forgetting somebody
feels like the youngest I've heard of
so so good for her I think she did good
work and deserved her promotion if
that's what it is
uh speaking of CNN Christina Amanpour
he gave a speech somewhere and she said
she doesn't believe she's in a
post-truth world and got a lot of
attention because she was making the
case that
um CNN should maybe not have held that
town hall the way they did it she didn't
think that was a good look told her boss
she says
but uh
and she says the truth matters and that
they can't just take both sides on
everything
sometimes you just got to follow the
truth as opposed to the both sides of it
now
doesn't that all sound just funny coming
from a long time CNN employee
doesn't it sound sort of ridiculous
did does she know where she works
she works at the biggest uh
distributor of fake news in modern times
except for maybe MSNBC
so
I I have to wonder about the level of
self-awareness
she knows the CNN pushed the Russia
collusion hoax
quite a bit right
and you know she knows about the laptop
she knows all the fake news that CNN has
pushed she's not unaware of that is she
so I actually wonder if there's some
kind of weird cognitive dissonance going
on where she actually thinks that the
things she's saying are rational and
fit the context of her life
it does it at all it looks absolutely
absurd that she would get up there and
talk about honesty
in the news while working for CNN that's
the most incompatible things you could
possibly do now I could have you know
it's not just CNN could have been in
some other news organization but
I don't know it's a bad look because it
makes you wonder if she's in control of
her faculties
or is she just lying or is she
experiencing some mental phenomenon you
don't know
but it's fascinating
So speaking of that
so Christina Amanpour wants CNN to stick
to the real serious news and not take
you know and not be at both sides or the
same day she said that or at least it's
reported
um CNN has a Stefan Collins and opinion
piece
in which he says the following things
now he's talked about Trump's big danger
the walls are closing in because of
those documents
you know all those other times the walls
were closing in
ignore those ignore those they tell you
nothing
this new thing oh the walls are closing
in on this the walls are closing in and
let me let me tell you how Stefan
Coulson explains these walls closing in
so see it this is in his opinion piece
CNN reported that the National Archives
um plans to hand 16 documents over to
the special counsel the show Trump knew
the correct procedure for declassifying
materials uh-oh
uh oh
Trump knew the correct procedure
because he used it for some documents
but then there were other documents in
which he did not use that procedure the
one that he knew was the correct one
so walls are closing in he's dead
it means there was definitely something
sketchy
there we go
um
so I think you heard me did you hear me
on
on YouTube or did he miss that part
a little buffering problem over there
you missed it I'll quickly repeat it so
Stephen Collison opinion piece CNN says
there Trump knew the proper process for
handling the secret documents because he
used the proper process
so we know he knew the proper process
because he used it
but then these other documents he didn't
use that process
so how could he say it's just
automatically
automatically Declassified when I took
them
now Stephen Collison does not offer any
possibility
why that would be okay
so I will
because it's fake news if you don't
offer the context
the context is there is no there is no
written required process for how to
declassify things
so here's what here's what Collinson is
doing
Collinson is conflating the fact that a
process was used
with the fact that there is a process
those are not the same
there is no official process
but they did sometimes usable
that does not obligate the president to
use it again
it's simply something he did once or
more than once so he knew he knew a way
to do it without getting in trouble
and I would give you that he knew a way
to do it where nobody would ask
questions
but he's additionally made the claim
that they were automatically
Declassified when I took them and I 100
agree with that statement even in the
context
of having used a real system of you know
getting approvals and checking with
people getting signatures and stuff
because the president has the sole power
to decide what the process is and you
know what the pro you know what the
president is not required to do
here's what the president is not
required by any law or statute or
Constitution
he does not need to tell you what the
process is
so the president can legally decide in
his head that the process is if I walk
out the door with these
they're Declassified
because in my head that's the process
completely legal 100 legal in my head I
thought well these are Declassified I
don't need to tell anybody
there is no process
taking them out the door
is a very clear indication that I no
longer want these classified
that's unambiguous isn't it there's no
ambiguity
with the president with a box full of
documents walking out the door
that leaves nothing to the imagination
these are documents that I do not plan
to have the same security control as
those ones I left back in the secure
place
what could be more clear
that he doesn't want them Declassified
than taking them out the door
that's that's a hundred percent clear
and there is no process
that he has to lift him so CNN
Israel you know the same day that
Christina Amanpour is saying oh CNN
we've got to report these honest things
it's the same week they're getting
lambasted for uh
you know the Russian collusion that
reporting and the same time they're
trying to conflate the fact that some
procedure was made up and used
with whether one exists
it's complete fake news
and they must know it don't you think I
mean I don't know I can't read their
minds you don't think Stefan Collinson
knows
that there's no process
and yet he's still reporting it like
there was of course he knows
because everybody knows I'm not even a
news person I know it how many of you
knew that John how many of you already
knew
that there is no written or
constitutional process for declassifying
if you're the president
look at all the people who knew that
like we all knew it and you think CNN
like somebody who does it for a living
he covers Trump for a living you think
he doesn't know that there's no process
any reports that there is
that's purely fake news what what else
could it be how else could you interpret
this
other than they're lying and and know
they're doing it Lying by Omission you
know leaving out an important part of
the story
all right
so
I saw Fox News at least the website
looks like they're going hard at uh Jake
Tapper
um
you know that it's a big chess board and
if uh
if the left can take Tucker Carlson's
piece off the chessboard you know
they're going to do it
so there's still some disagreement
whether there was a secret verbal
agreement with Dominion to get rid of
Tucker
do you believe there was a secret verbal
agreement to get rid of Tucker
I don't
by the way Tucker is saying that a
reportedly a board member told them that
now I I don't disagree that a board
member may have said it
so that part I don't have a feeling
about a board member might have said it
but I don't live in a world where any
lawyer would let you do that
Am I Wrong are there any lawyers here
who can tell me that with a deal of that
size and that visibility
everything would be written down
or it wouldn't it wouldn't apply
I I see no chance of a verbal agreement
because he wasn't let go until the deal
was made right the deal was done and
then they let him go who in the world
would have trusted that after the deal
was agreed on that somebody would do
something that damaging to their own
business
I don't believe that I do believe Tucker
meaning that somebody told them it
happened
so that part you know there's no history
of Tucker just making up
right I mean you can be wrong like
anybody can be wrong
but he has no history of making up
so I'm sure he told somebody told them
that I just don't think it's true
the deal hasn't closed yet
I get that but it's been announced
and that would be you know too too much
pregnant to try to pull it back and
renegotiate
all right
um
but anyway Fox News is going after Jake
Tapper as you know part of his
uh Russia collusion hoax reporting you
know he had he had James Clapper on and
all kinds of people to lie
um I guess I'll defend
Jake Tapper a little bit here
which is it is news if people make
claims if if James Clapper is making a
claim you know of this size it is
appropriate to have them on
so I you know I can't I can't push back
on them for having guests on that lied
to him because Tucker had guests on the
line as well or we're wrong we don't
know
but you know having people on who lie is
not that's not a crime so I don't think
you can hold that against them
we can compare the following
when Tucker Carlson had uh Cindy Powell
on he listened to all her story which is
his job and presented it
and then when he tried to get it
verified and couldn't get it verified he
did a monologue in which he said there's
no there's no evidence for these claims
and he was pretty clear about it
there is no evidence
and showed or you know his lack of
believing it I don't believe that Jake
Tapper ever doubted the Russia occlusion
story in a public way I don't know what
he privately thought but I don't believe
he ever publicly said you know what this
story is not check it out
yeah so
um I'd be surprised if Tapper is still
there by the election day 2024.
I feel like uh
I just feel like he he's not going to
survive the
the new era
yeah and
um
yeah I just don't see him last thing
all right
Jonathan Turley who is becoming rapidly
becoming my favorite political Observer
uh
he's dumping on Philip a bump at the
Washington Post because Philip the bump
is still trying to uh
I think he's still trying to say that
the Russian collusion is sort of true
[Laughter]
and and Turley just takes about the
bayonets them in public well it's the
most wonderful bayonetting of a public
figure you'll ever say you know because
because the Washington Post and the
other
uh the other entities they just got
murdered you just got murdered by the
the Durham report saying they'd all been
reporting for years and the
Washington Post is among the worst of
the reporters I mean they're
they're clearly a fake news you know
company primarily they're primarily a
fake News company and Phil Martin has
come after me on Twitter and I was
always wondering
why why is this one guy
so after me like no matter what I do
Phil bump will come in and insult me
personally on Twitter
and I always thought God he doesn't even
look like
he means it like he looks like he's just
being paid to say about anybody on
one side he looks this is not an
accusation that he is paid
he acts as someone who's not a real
reporter he doesn't even act like he's
supposed to be doing a job or reporting
he acts like he's just some kind of
democrat or CIA
operative well he there's nothing about
him that screams he's really a
journalist it just seems he's an
operative of some kind
and watching Turley take him out and and
Bayonet him for all of his past uh
behavior is just a wonderful read I
recommend it so just Google that and you
should follow Jonathan Turley in general
he's writing is spectacular
um
so
this next story goes into the category
of why did this take so long
so congressperson Anna Paulina Luna
is
um
she filed a motion to expel Adam Schiff
from the U.S House of Representatives
for lying about the
Russia collusion
now
what took so long
there could never be a more obvious case
where somebody should be losing their
job
have you ever in in the history of jobs
have you ever heard any situation that
was as bad as what Adam shifted
he literally tried to change the
government based on looking at the
secret information that he was
privileged to see and then lying about
it in public repeatedly to change the
nature of the government
that's as low as you can get
yeah on the list of crimes that should
be execution
that's not a joke by the way in terms of
the severity of what Adam Schiff did as
far as I know it's probably legal to lie
to the public if you're in Congress
because otherwise they'd all be in jail
so it's probably completely legal
so I'm just going to say if it were not
legal
the correct penalty would be death
what he did to the country in my opinion
deserves the death penalty
because he destroyed the Integrity of
the Republic
he did it intentionally
he did it for personal and other gain
and we know it for sure
we're not guessing you know all the
guesswork's done we now know what the
truth was
they intentionally lied to the public
about the biggest thing you could
possibly lie about
that would have changed the entire
government
that would be the death sentence if it
were illegal
am I wrong
what would be a bigger crime than
intentionally destroying the Integrity
of the entire nation
I
it's hard to imagine I mean other than
you know some outrageous mass murder
what would be worse what's more damaging
to more people
I mean
it's insanely bad so
um
why did it take so long
there was not one other Republican who
was willing to say you know
we all do some bad things but not that
bad
that's a whole different level of life
that's not normal lying
that's using his his privileged
security clearance
to tell a lie that could destroy the
country I mean that's just so bad
so it's a disgrace that only one
Republican stepped up and it took so
long I I'll let go of the why did it
take so long
because I always mocked people who say
that
everything that's good
should have been done sooner would you
agree
everything that's good
should have been none sooner so I don't
like that
you know criticism because it's just
it's like air it's just Universal
but why didn't anybody else do it or why
why didn't anybody else sign on to it
that part I don't understand
so this is somebody who picked up the
free money Anna Paulina Luna
just want you to hear that name
maybe we have another Superstar you know
do we have somebody who is an
up-and-comer somebody who's a DeSantis
who can pick up the free money this was
free money
do you think there's anybody who's a
republican who's going to have a problem
with this
no no this is going to be super popular
so why nobody else did it
like why only one person could figure
out how to you know make some money from
this is that her real picture
with two uh rifles
all right well keep an eye on her she
might be uh one to watch
um
did you know the economics
uh is just a big word for guessing
you know this is a true story my so my
degree is in economics as I say too
often and one of the reasons that I
didn't pursue economics as a field is it
felt too much like just guessing
because because it doesn't predict
anything
if economics could predict things well
then you'd have something
right there you'd have something now you
can predict maybe the most obvious
things
but do you remember when we said a
trillion dollars in national debt was
way too much there's no way we're going
to survive that
and now it's like 30 trillion
obviously we had no understanding of how
much debt we could handle now I do think
maybe we can't handle this much
but the one trillion was never a risk
and yet economics we thought it was
here's a couple more examples
um what would you say about people
leaving New York
do you think that there are rich people
do you think rich people are leaving New
York
the news would suggest they are right
you say no
no because we know there's less
occupancy of the
The Office Buildings but don't you think
that residents are also leaving New York
well I don't know the answer to that
question I don't know if they are or not
but I thought they were but here's the
surprise the average rent in Manhattan
is way up
it's actually more expensive to live
there it's like at an all-time high
didn't you think that the rent would
come down because people would get out
of the city because it's crumbly
so was that predictable
to me that was opposite or predictable
now I understand the inflation blah blah
blah but
um Office Buildings are losing residence
and they're lowering their prices
so if if offices in the same city have
to lower their prices
and I get that's because the hybrid
working situation but I thought people
were moving out
anyway so my point is that I don't think
that was predictable
you want another one that's not
predictable
black employment is the strongest it's
ever been
at the same time that we're having
masses of immigration uh you know folks
coming over the Border
didn't didn't The Economist tell us
that the black employment rate would be
the one that get hit the hardest because
all these workers would be coming in and
competing for jobs and you know under
bidding and stuff like that didn't you
think that black employment would be
really a problem because of all the
immigration
is not
is not apparently blacks are doing great
in terms of
um the best employee the best
unemployment level that we've ever seen
in the history of the country
yeah there's probably an age difference
in that you're right
but that was not predictable right
economics would have said all this
competition coming in at the the low end
of the economic
scales should have affected the other
people at the low end of the economic
scale in a predictable way but it was
the opposite
we're terrible at predicting
many of you who were opposed to the
massive wave of illegal immigration
which I also oppose but was for slightly
different reasons how many of you are
sure that's bad for the economy
how many of you are confident that we
have this this field of Economics that
can really obviously tell you what's
going to happen next and that all these
immigrants coming in that's going to be
bad for the country right
because they're not paying taxes right
away
and they might have a drag on you know
medical stuff and
bring some crime in you know not not a
lot but they do bring in crime
right so I don't think you can predict
anything anymore
that my personal prediction is that
immigration even at its out of control
levels ends up positive in one
generation
not right away
so it's expensive in the short term
but I think it's one generation because
those kids go to school
and they end up citizens
they pay their taxes eventually
but I do think that it's becoming a good
uh
a good political
thing I saw a video of uh some kind of
YouTube of four young black guys just
talking about politics and stuff I guess
it's a regular show and they were
talking about the immigrants coming in
and and the four young black guys all
said this basically were on the same
page it's like what
they're not paying taxes
which was really good to hear
like every once in a while you think oh
the country is the country is all
divided
but there's one thing that we're not
divided on we don't like taxes
and and we don't like other people not
to pay them
so the the four young black guys who are
on the video were just saying are you
kidding they're letting all these people
in they're shipping them to Chicago
putting them in black neighborhoods and
they don't pay taxes
how is that helping us
which is the right question to ask it
was exactly the right question now I
disagree with them
on the economics of it
right because I don't think that's
predictable but they're asking the exact
right question
yeah their their logic is solid and
their analysis of the situation
is on point
don't know if it's right because again
economics is hard to predict but they're
asking all the right questions I think
that's going to be an important factor
in the next election
uh
all right
so let's talk about Ukraine they either
shot down 29 of the 30 Russian missiles
that came in last night to Kiev or as
Russia says they had massive success
attacking
so it's one of those
either was a massive success
or nothing happened
now I heard a theory on the news that I
had myself but since I'm not a military
person I kept it to myself until
somebody smarter said it goes like this
when zielinski is asked when is the
counter offensive starting
have you heard his answer to that
soon yeah we're not right we're not
quite ready
but we're almost you know I can't tell
you when you know because putting a date
on it would be a mistake but um yeah
we're getting ready
so here is my interpretation of that
which I heard somebody else have the
same Theory it already started
he's not going to tell you it started
because that would be a disadvantage
militarily
he's going to tell you it started well
after it starts
you don't announce your attack
you you say I don't know could happen
anytime now when you're actually doing
it
right so I think that the
counter-offensive is well underway
and our news is not smart enough to fact
check him on that
because they do seem to be at least
they're reporting taking some territory
I don't know
who knows you can't believe anything
that comes out of the area but
definitely don't believe zielinski when
he says
so so Joe is mocking me for my lack of
military strategy genius
are you new
are you new Joe
first time you've been here
you know I've been making military
predictions for a long time and they've
been unusually correct
I don't claim any expertise but I will
tell you that my military predictions
have been pretty freaking great
compared to the experts so far
so far
all right
I'm also hearing that uh not from
reliable sources but from sources that
Ukraine is losing something like five to
eight times as many people as Russia do
you believe that
that math doesn't work I I believe that
their casualties are heavy and it might
be worse than Russia but five died eight
times more
nah I'm sorry the the math of that just
doesn't work they would have run out of
people already
I just don't see the math worker
I certainly believe that they don't
report correctly so I don't believe the
official numbers of course but five to
eight times more
I just don't see it
yeah yeah casualties mean injury does
mean death but still
counting defectors as casualties Maybe
yeah
troops are mostly polish somebody says
oh yeah I want to give a correction I
saw somebody in the comments talking
about this
I'd refer to NLP when I was talking
about the AI I I thought that Brian
Romell was talking about uh
hypnosis NLP but NLP in that context is
natural language processing
not not neuro-linguistic
whatever
um
they're surrounded somebody says
uh you get the good stuff the real stuff
tell us how
somebody else okay
all right ladies and gentlemen that
is the conclusion of my prepared
thoughts was it was there anything I
missed anything happening today that I
forgot to mention
[Music]
um
the nutria at least
I don't know the massacre anything about
Ukraine I just Shrugged I don't know
what's true
cheap labor
will the reframe book cover stress yes
some guides
um
Kerry Lake voter fraud was there
something happened in the Cary Lake
legal stuff I didn't see a story about
that
wasn't there supposed to be something
that happened
all right Harry and Megan
Riley Gaines
I feel like the trans story got
completely off the headlines
did you notice that everything was trans
trans and it just sort of stopped
it's not much of it lately
I was getting pretty tired of it
the verification case should go on so
Kerry Lake had a minor success
I see the comment that there are 500
military age
Chinese citizens crossing the border
is that because we suspect that they're
part of the Communist Regime and they're
going to be part of a military takeover
or do you just think that they're the
ones who
are just trying to get into America to
become Americans
yeah no I believe it's true
I mean I just don't know that I should
worry about it
because I'm not you know I feel people
are far more likely coming here because
they want to come here as opposed to
sabotage
um
okay
yes and I'll I will say again that uh AI
I think is overrated I don't think it'll
ever reason and I don't think you're
gonna confuse it for a human for
uh in the foreseeable future
yeah you got at least consider it it's
true you have to consider the risk
all right
um
yeah it doesn't take too many terrorists
to be a problem that's the problem
large language models they're never
going to be logical they can't
all right
and a long enough timeline anything's
possible but they would have to invent a
new method the current method of AI
doesn't get you to
uh where the machine is smart
uh I'm going to tell the people on
locals of a little experiment that's too
dangerous for you YouTube sorry
sorry
I can't let this thought be into the
general public but I can tell the people
on locals because they're special
all right that's All For You YouTube and
I'll talk to locals for a little while
and I'll see you in the morning bye for
now
