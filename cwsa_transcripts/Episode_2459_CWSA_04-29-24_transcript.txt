Jerry Seinfeld who recently turned
70 can you believe that the Seinfeld is
70 it doesn't seem possible it just
seems impossible but uh he's looking
great for 70 and uh he's another one of
those people I would put forward as a
good example of uh exercise and
diet I mean look at Seinfeld at 70 and
then ask yourself does eating right and
exercising
work apparently yes apparently it does
and about his mind is his mind still
sharp for 70 yes it is uh doesn't look
any different to me and it's because
he's been using his mind consistently
every day doing hard level you know
difficult things and he he's a good
example of doing everything
right well uh chrisy gnome um you know
as you know she wrote in her book that
she had to kill the family dog she shot
the family dog because it was a bad dog
and the conversation is well does that
take her out of the running for vice
president well I have a contrarian view
about
that if you're Trump and the person
you're
against has literally been nicknamed Old
Yeller that would be Biden because he's
old and he yells and there's an old
movie called Old Yeller about a family
that killed their dog well Christy gnome
is the only person who has experienced
killing Old
Yeller you're welcome this is why you
this is why you listen to me is for my
Old Yeller dad jokes yep Christy gnome
she's the only one who's already killed
Old Yeller I call that relevant
experience all right the other thing
that Seinfeld said is that uh is that
comedy is dead humor is dead because now
it has to go through a committee and the
extreme left has ruined it huh Seinfeld
you would think he would be identified
with Democrats and yet here he is
criticizing his own team for having
destroyed
humor
humor I mean just just just try to hold
that in your
head let me just say it once in a clean
way and now hold this in you had
according to oh I would say the most
successful
Democrat um humorist of the age
according to
him Democrats killed
humor and I think they
did how do you destroy humor
that wasn't even on my list of things
that could be
destroyed like if you'd said to me 20
years ago make a list of all the things
you care about that could be taken from
you and
destroyed would I have put humor on my
list of 20 things that they might be
able to take away from me if if they
tried no I never would have guessed the
jokes could go away never in my life
would I have guessed
that well in related uh news
um 2023 is box office has been a
gigantic disaster and movies are so
dead that all the people working in the
industry are desperately trying to find
work and
not see I wonder why movies are dead
could it be that they only make the same
movie over and over again could it be
could it be that movies can't be funny
anymore because humor is dead yes it
could good and if you take humor out of
the movies what's
left well there's a scene where you tie
somebody to a chair to torture them
there's the beginning scene called act
one where your family members and or
your best friends are all slaughtered
everybody likes to watch that and then
there's uh innumerable scenes where the
hero will beat up more than one person
at a time more than one at a time I've
never seen that in the movie have you
then there might be a a car chase scene
possibly with a helicopter involved yeah
a helicopter nobody ever saw that
coming very
creative and um then depending on the
movie if it's
sci-fi a one of the people might have to
cross a desert on their
own might be some kind of a test to see
if they are the chosen one can they
cross the desert on their own well maybe
they should make a new
movie just one that doesn't have any of
that in it just make a movie with none
of that and how about no cringy uh gay
love scenes or or straight love scenes
how about no cringey love scenes at all
just get rid of them do you know what
you never see on social media when
you're looking at reals and you're like
totally engaged and unlike movies you're
like Spellbound you're watching the
reals and you're just doing one or time
there 10 seconds you know what is never
on a reel somebody tied to a chair and
tortured they have time I mean the real
is not so short that they can't do it
but they just don't do
it do you know what else is not in a
real
typically a couple either gay or
straight or
non-binary having cringy
relationships I sure love you I love you
all over the place and you just want to
go get your cringey love affair out of
here how about car chases you don't see
a lot of car chases in the reals reals
basically said why don't we just put
stuff people like in
here movies said let's put stuff in here
that they've seen a million times so
they'll know it's a
movie it shouldn't be a big surprise I'm
surprised movies last as long as I did
really anyway um I tried to watch Dune
2 took me five
tries has anybody tried to watch Dune
2 five tries every time I'd watch it I'd
be like why am I spending time on this
guy in
desert I get they don't have much
water what else there just not a lot
happening anyway movies are
dead the uh there's a report Al jazer I
think is reporting that the Gateway
pundit declared bankruptcy in part or
maybe mostly because of a bunch of
string of defamation
lawsuits so that doesn't mean they're
out of business it just means they're in
chapter 11 protection to give them some
Court relief from the
claims so that's not good um I'm
surprised that there aren't more
defamation lawsuits in the media in
general I don't know how anybody could
be in in that business
actually uh California has a uh new
initiative that will be on the ballot I
guess in November and the initiative is
to make it illegal to do crimes in
California wow that' be new I don't know
if you know but it's been completely
legal to do crimes in California I'm
exaggerating a little bit but um the
under $900 if you stole it the police
wouldn't care that sort of thing
well it looks like there's going to be
some uh movement to change that so they
only needed half a million signatures to
get this thing on the ballot basically
it would Rec
criminalize um a bunch of stuff that had
been
decriminalized and they needed half a
million signatures they got 900,000 and
the biggest problem is that people were
lined up for hours to sign
it hold that in your head it was a it's
a bot Initiative for California now I
live in California and I've seen tons of
people trying to sign people up for
ballot initiatives and you know in over
the
years what's the longest line you've
ever seen for somebody to sign a a
ballot initiative
or some kind of an election related
thing what's the longest line you've
ever seen three
people maybe a maximum three they're
lucky if they can get one they're
usually working one person at a
time this had people waiting in
line 4 hours four hours people waited in
line to sign this damn thing do you
think The Californians are ready for a
change now hold in your mind The
Californians were willing to wait 4
hours to sign something to say can you
make crime illegal again
remember that when I tell when I talk to
you about the bench that the Democrats
have that the governor of
California is their strongest player
who's not Biden and in his State people
lined up for
hours just to try to vow some safety
into their
situation he's he's their best bench
player well sure enough uh the mystery
of how is it that uh Trump could be
leading in every category except that uh
he's not leading at the Top Line as much
as he should in some polls some are
saying he's leading by a lot we'll talk
about that but it's women so 58% of uh
women now back Biden and 36% back Trump
now I think that mostly means single
women right it's married women they
didn't break it down but I think married
women are still slightly prot Trump I
believe so they don't say single but
that really is the biggest part because
if they said single they would also be
indicating its mental illness to back
Biden and I would say at this
point you know I think there was a point
where a reasonable smart mentally
healthy person could look at the two
choices and say you know what I'd like
to try Biden for a while you know maybe
I get a little unhealth care that I want
you know maybe some things that I want I
think there was a time when it made
sense not that I would have chosen it
but that a reasonable person with a
healthy brain could say you know you
know Trump is kind of divisive let's try
something
else but not
now people not now you've actually
watched Biden in office you've seen what
he can
do and the one thing you could be sure
of if if if he's reelected he will do
even worse he didn't get any better he
didn't get smarter over four years he's
just degrading there's nothing left now
if 58% of women are still backing Biden
and you know that really means single
women for the the biggest part of that
and you know the single liberal women
are
literally the biggest healthc care
concern in the country I'm not making
that up it's really a shocking number of
them have mental illness so Biden is
literally being backed by the mental the
the least mentally capable people in our
Republic they're the least capable
emotionally mentally and that's I'm not
making that up that's just a
fact and apparently that Gap is even
growing so there's even you know women
are moving toward them even faster the
single
ones um let's see
so the gender divide is widening and it
bit how how many of you pe how many of
you believed me back in
maybe when did I start saying it maybe
2016 or 17 I started telling you that it
was obvious that the Republicans were
becoming the party of men and the women
who like those
men and that the Democrats were becoming
the party of women and sure enough here
we are
um John fedman continues to entertain me
I don't agree with everything that John
fedman likes as policy but I do like his
Vibe lately um and and I you know I feel
some honestly I feel better that I'm not
mocking him every day for his his health
problems I was one of the people who
didn't think he was going to come back I
really didn't think that was recoverable
it didn't look like it but I learned
something so the first thing I learned
is apparently that kind of condition is
recoverable which is really really good
to know that's one of the best things
he's ever done for the country really I
mean he he showed that you can come back
from
that that was a really good lesson
because there must be tons of people who
are in that situation and they're
looking at him and saying whoa you can
actually come back from
this um
well I saw him with his wife the other
day so somebody said his wife left him
but they were just together at that
White House correspondence dinner so
that's all I know about
that anyway he said about the Hamas
demonstrations he said I don't believe
living in a pup tent for Hamas is really
helpful I don't believe that living in a
pup tent for Hamas is really helpful
now that's a that's a good way to sum up
that situation living in a pupt for
Hamas it's not really helping now I
would like to say something uh that just
has to be said that I don't know why we
don't say it more how many of you were
ever College age you weren't weren't
necessarily in college but how many of
you were ever you know 18 to 21 a lot of
you right Mo most of you are now older
than 18 to 21 so most of you know what
that experience is
like I'm just speaking for
myself but I was an idiot when I was 18
to 21 you certainly wouldn't want me to
make your big geopolitical decisions for
you in fact there are quite a few
opinions I held back then that I think
are ridiculous now and not only that but
it wasn't just
me I I met my fellow student
no better no no there were no brilliant
and wise people I went to college with
they were all idiots just like me I was
an idiot compared to you know what you
become as you learn how the world works
now that's not an
insult but but the fact that we're
calling them our students oh our ivy
league students are protesting we better
pay attention cuz the ivy league
students are protesting no the
stupidest the stupidest Among Us the
young I'm sorry but they're the
stupidest and even the young will admit
that someday I'm not even disagreeing
with them someday they will be on my
team and they will say yeah you know I
was kind of an idiot when I was that
age why are we not reporting it like
that when did we like it's the most
basic fact about the protests is that is
mostly
idiots so you have the mentally
unhealthy the young women and then the
young men who are idiots and then other
people are you know paid organizers and
stuff so these are not real protests
like some part of the country disagrees
with the other part no this is what
happens when you put money
stupidity and me and poor mental health
all in one
place they live
intense yeah and you know what if you
were to release them to the wild the
same people protesting and living in
tents you said hey I've got an idea if
you don't like the way things are we'll
take all of the protesters and you can
build your own civilization we'll give
you land Freedom you know no attacks
there'll be no Predators you can just go
build your own ideal situation and we'll
check on you in 20 years see how you're
doing
take take all those protesters put them
in one place check on them in 20
years still in
tents that's what I'm saying come back
in 20 years they'll still be in those
 tents because these are not the
winners these are the idiots and the
people with poor mental health now
someday many of those idiots will be
smart wise productive citizens but not
yet
not yet don't treat them like their
opinions matter they shouldn't matter
they should not matter at all now if if
those protesters were also let's say
very much uh the same opinion as the
public very
useful for example the Vietnam
protesters although they were young I
didn't say the same thing about them you
know why because they represented lots
of older people had exactly the same
opinion that we should get out of
Vietnam so to the extent that the young
people are representing a larger body of
people but they're just have more free
time and they're braver or whatever
can't get fired then yeah that's great
young people yeah young people go
protest but when the young people are
the only ones who have this opinion
along with the mentally unhealthy people
and the people who who believe fake news
we shouldn't be paying attention to them
like it's some kind of difference of
opinion it's not really a difference of
opinion it's the idiots and the
mentally incapable people plus money and
then you get that that's what that
is anyway there's a report that DeSantis
and Trump met to try to get along and
that maybe they'll bury the hatchet as
they say and maybe disantis will do some
fundraising for
Trump I think that's makes sense don't
you it it makes sense to me that they
would get
along eventually I guess you know when
when Trump was calling a DeSantis Des
sanctimonious that was such a light
touch that you knew that later they
wanted to have the option of you know
working together it was such a light
touch so yeah that should be fine Fox
News did a whole segment just on Biden's
uh fake resume things the things he says
he's done and they had to do a whole
segment on it there were so many and
that's only the non-political lies this
was only the lies about his own personal
background now keep in mind that the
main thing that Biden offered was
honesty that's the main thing you
offered right I can't have any of this
lying
anymore and uh what they had to do was
fire the fact Checkers because Biden
lied so much
that their entire you know brainwashing
and gaslighting they gave you about
Trump's lying didn't make so much sense
anymore in the CNN and S SRS
poll um 55% said they see Trump's
presidency as a success compared to only
39% for Biden think about the difference
between those numbers
55% nice nice solid majority said said
uh that Trump's president was presidency
was a success and only 39 say that about
Biden how in the world do you win an
election with those numbers if that were
the only number you knew
about it's a landslide
right that number alone with no other
number you wouldn't have to hear any
other number you wouldn't have to know
where the polls were you would just have
to know that one thing 55% compared to
39 that's not close that's not the
margin of
error that's a
blowout but what about the polls still
tie still better tie depending on which
fake polling you you want to look at all
right CBS says uh most swing state
voters say their finances have gotten
worse under Biden and agree they'll be
financially better off if president
Trump wins so if Trump wins 47% of the
people in swing States the important
ones say they'll be better off if Biden
wins only 21% think they'll be better
off that's more than double for
Trump again that's not a margin of error
rounding problem that's a blowout number
these two numbers should if everything
were normal and the elections were real
it should be the biggest Electoral
College win of any president maybe
including Reagan he might actually beat
Reagan's best
numbers with these but will that happen
we're in strange times so maybe not uh
literally Anything could happen but
these numbers are just a flashing bright
land slide
numbers and nothing's going to change
they're not going to replace Biden I
don't think they'll replace them it's
too
late here's Trump on fracking in
Pennsylvania Pennsylvania being a key
swing state winning it would be critical
to Biden he couldn't I don't think Biden
could win at all without winning
Pennsylvania but 49% of Voters in
Pennsylvania say Trump would do a better
job on fracking oil and gas and only 33%
say Biden would do a better job now
given that fracking is a pretty big deal
in Pennsylvania 40 9% to
33 that's blowout numbers again we're
not talking about the margin of error in
the polling there's no comparison
between what people think of these two
candidates and I've got a new Trump
slogan I did not come up with this this
is from a user on X called Pismo
B you ready I I want you if if you
haven't heard this yet maybe some of you
saw it an next if you haven't heard it
yet I want you to hear this slogan for
the first time so this is a proposed
Trump slogan I want you to see how it
feels all right so turn off your
intellectual buttons and just see how
this feels here's the slogan Trump
creates Biden
destroys Trump creates Biden destroys
do you feel
it just feel
it you can feel that one can
you am I
right but when I heard that I was like
oh my God somehow that seems to have
captured
everything because what is Trump talking
about Trump is talking about building
brand new cities with flying cars
creating right creating
Trump is talking about uh he he created
a uh the Abraham Accords he created
peace and a big economic potential there
that's
creation um if you look at what Biden's
done he's destroyed the Border destroyed
the economy inflation destroyed Ukraine
he's destroying the Middle East if you
believe that it wouldn't have happened
under Trump
that
argument hits me exactly in my
heart like intellectually I know what
the argument would be that Trump creates
and and Biden destroys but I feel it
like you just feel that one goes right
through
you and and I think there's something so
fundamental about the difference between
creation and destruction that they sort
of are a a yin and yang situation where
where're B has to become the opposite of
trump in order to have a reason to
exist but he couldn't do
it so he tried to be opposite of trump
on telling the truth but he became the
biggest liar in political history
probably the most famous liar in history
who isn't Trump I
guess so that's what's happening all
right Trump creates Biden destroys
um Charles Payne of Fox
Business um he had a good uh insightful
comment here about uh CNN he said CNN
has to make up an issue because Biden is
behind and everything else so if you did
normal issue polling and you said what
do you think about the economy Trump
wins easily what do you think about the
bordon Border Trump wins what do you
think about Ukraine Trump wins Middle
East Trump wins so everything that you
would
imagine would be important Trump wins so
what did CNN do well Charles Payne is
calling them out accurately for making
up an issue out of
words they're making up an
issue and of
words does that make sense if I tell you
that the economy is doing poorly you say
oh I know what an economy is and I know
what doing poorly is got it if I tell
you that uh Biden's going to start a war
you go War got it I know what a war is
stopping War good got
it that's easy here's what Donna Brazil
said quote the Supreme Court is close to
election interference Justice delayed is
democracy
denied so the issue that CNN is trying
to make an issue is that Trump would end
democracy that's just
words and
democracy
in in what
way is it the Biden who's jailing his
opponent and trying to get the other
opponent assassinated without having any
Secret Service
protection is it is it is Biden
protecting democracy by putting all the
protesters for January 6 in
jail how how exactly is he prot
protecting
democracy it's literally word
thinking that the Democrats apparently
are completely aware that they don't
have any issues they can run on they
don't have honesty that's gone they
don't have capability they don't have
age they can't run on the record because
Trump's record as president you don't
have to wonder is better than Biden's as
president I've never seen this situation
before in my life right in my life has
there ever been two ex-presidents or
current and an ex running against each
other not in my life
right
and so they literally are trying to
stretch words together to make it a word
oh well you know we've got the election
interference because the Democracy
denied thanks to the Justice which is
delayed in the system in which democracy
is important uh can't have an
Insurrection it's literally just a bunch
of
words and the public is like
what all right but thankfully the
Democrats do have some senior uh wise
people I mock the Democrats for not
having a good bench but at least at
least they have James
Carville so James Carville to the rescue
um a respected Democrat strategist and
he says he's trying to get the young
people on board he says uh if Trump wins
there will be no government left there
will be no rights left you will live
under theocracy you'll end up with
Christian nationalism but that's all
right you little 26y old you
don't feel like the elections are
important so that's their adult
leadership uh where hang in yeah it's uh
do you remember when he was about it's
the economy
stupid it's the economy stupid let me
see if I understand this it's the
economy the economy okay I know what the
economy
is and he's telling us that we should
focus on the economy got it got it the
economy is a real thing and you should
focus on it got it now let's check up on
him his new philosophy heers there will
be no government left
what uh there'll be no rights left to
you wait which which rights are Trump
taking away it was there a news cycle I
missed where some rights got taken away
I don't recall that at
all and you'll live under a
theocracy
really didn't wasn't it just a few years
ago they were saying that Trump was
probably a secret atheist protect in to
be a religious and that's changed
completely to he's going to put you
under a
theocracy based
on what
exactly uh I guess it's all abortion uh
and then Christian
nationalism the last time anybody was
worried about Christian
nationalism I think n Gingrich was in
power do do you remember when that was
the thing
there's not a ton of Christian
nationalism sweeping over the country
what exactly is even looking
at how how how far he's fallen from uh
let's bring in the young people to vote
and the economy is very important all
the way to well be no government left
they'll take your rights or you live
under a theocracy you'll end up with
Christian nationalism and all the 26
year olds are
idiots so
that's their best
guy that's their best guy right there on
on
strategy Alan dtz continues to say that
the uh the Manhattan trial of trump the
one about the stormmy Daniels payments
he says there's no
crime hold this in your
mind Alan
jtz who only votes
Democrat and but he is famous for
calling the facts as he sees
them famous Democrat Alan dtz famous
lawyer Alan dtz looks at this situation
in detail and says there's not even a
crime that's being
charged they're literally trying to make
up something as they go and he points
out that the reason that David pecker is
on the stand talking about catch and
kill is because they don't have a crime
to talk about so they're actually
putting Witnesses
to talk about unrelated things because
otherwise they wouldn't have anybody to
talk about anything so they've got to
give somebody to talk about something
that you don't like even though it's not
really relevant to the case so that
you'll have a a general unpleasant
feeling about Trump because that's the
best I can do because there's no
crime there's no crime what could be
better than having Ellen dtz said tell
the world yes as a famous Democrat and
the fam most famous lawyer you know I'm
telling you that this is law Affair and
there's no crime and they're just going
after Trump in the United
States while while Biden is telling you
that he's trying to protect
democracy well yep you protect the
Democracy by trying to put your opponent
in jail for something that's not a crime
according to a famous Democrat who is a
famous
slower online the other day I I got into
a debate with a troll and I don't know
if you've noticed but the trolls are
either worse or they're you know I don't
know they're just really bad at it
lately and the troll said uh that there
was in fact Russia collusion because
Michael Cohen said
so and I said did you really use as your
Source One of the world's most famous
Liars like like if you said let's make a
list of the biggest Liars in the news
Michael Cohen would be right at the
top and that was that was the best
argument against Trump is that Michael
Cohen said something
once that's what they
have they got Michael
Cohen I mentioned this before but it's
such a a head Shaker uh apparently there
is information now from some uh
unclassified documents that got
unredacted and Julie Kelly's all over
this um that the GSA the group in the
government that's uh in control of these
classified documents apparently at one
point they had control of classified
documents that they were trying to get
Trump to take possession
of you never heard that story did you
how how did we get this far into that
whole maralago box story and only now
we're finding out that instead of trump
holding on to boxes and preventing them
from going to the GSA the GSA had boxes
and were trying to force Trump to take
them
now how long did it take us to find that
that out now was it a
setup was it a setup because here's what
we know for sure there's no way Trump
knew what was in those boxes
just hold that in your mind no matter
what was in the boxes and no matter
whether it was a setup or not a
setup there is no way that Trump would
have known what was in the boxes that
the GSA had in their possession do you
agree there is no way he would have
known what was in the boxes he would
have imagined it's you know part of what
we packed up but he wouldn't even know
what was packed up do you think he stood
in front of every box and said all right
let's see that folder yeah yeah okay
that folder goes in the Box show me
another folder M uhhuh okay yeah put
that in the Box do you think it went
that
way
no there there may have been a dozen
things that Trump said make sure these
are in the
box but he certainly didn't know what
90% of it was that was going into the
boxes there's no way he knew I mean it's
just not it's just not believable that
he stood over that process and watched
them load boxes right um and now that
you know that there's these mystery
boxes that got shipped
in are you going to know for sure that
if anything was found and by the way I
don't think there was if anything was
found in those boxes that was really a
problem are you going to know for sure
that they were the gsa's boxes that they
foed on the president or the ones that
he packed himself with for knowledge
that he was stealing some
Secrets yeah everything about that is as
sketchy as you
think um Bill Amman who we think was a
Democrat but apparently did not vote for
Biden voted I think he voted for Trump
in the last election he said the biggest
mistake Democrats have made is
supporting um President Biden for a
second term he says that by supporting
Biden they have given him false
confidence that he can win the race as a
result he did not step
aside blah blah blah and now it looks
like he's going lose by a lot
okay here's what I think I don't think
it's as simple as um Biden got false
confidence although probably
did who else were they going to
run they would have replaced him I think
if they had a better
candidate remember my conversation about
Californians lining up for
hours to vote that crime should be
illegal again in
California and that that's their best
guy the governor of California with a
massive deficit he just ran up um
problems with you know electricity
closed down our nuclear power plants
open border crime everywhere poop on the
sidewalks that's their best
guy no I think that Biden is running
because they don't have a better
choice I do at one point I thought well
obviously they have better choice
choices you know there's just something
some kind of sticking point here but
where are
they the vice president is barely
functional and the other people we talk
about like Pete Budaj Pete Buddha judge
is often talked about as like one of
their Stars
seriously there's no way Pete Buddha
judge is going to be Trump in an
election and there's no way that Nome
could be Trump
I I think that Trump is the Nome killer
the Buddha judge killer the only hope
they had was that Biden could you know
keep everybody on one team
basically
and uh that was our only hope so I
disagree with Amman I think that it
wasn't a mistake to keep Biden I think
they didn't have a
choice I think they looked really hard
for their options and didn't find one
honestly if Bill lman had r for
office he would actually look like a
pretty strong Choice he'd never get
elected
but and the talent that the Democrats do
have because they do have talent but
they're all over
70 right Schumer Has Talent Nancy Pelosi
has
talent but uh they're too
old uh Bloomberg is saying that apple is
maybe thinking about putting open AI on
their phones which would be a major
thing but also reports that work on
their own AI for phones and will run
locally so I think maybe what apple is
doing is just looking at all their
options all the time so I think it's too
early to say what they're going to do
but the fact that Apple doesn't have a
major AI Play
Already really tells you the Steve Joba
mattered yeah just the fact we're even
having the conversation about Apple
trying to catch up on
AI we shouldn't be having that
conversation they they should be leading
that
back
anyway Mario Nal is uh talking about uh
there might be a 10 trillion dollar
market valuation just AI stuff if you
count Microsoft meta alphabet they're
all ramping up musk is saying that Tesla
is going to put another 10 billion this
year into AI
development and nvidia's GPU sales
projected to reach 40 billion in 20 24
which would surpass both AMD and
Intel did you know that Nvidia is bigger
than
Intel when did that
happen
what um here's what I think is going to
happen I think the Democrats are going
to introduce an AI tax maybe a robot tax
but because it's going to be the same
thing here's why do you know what
Democrats tax
they tax anything that's big and
unavoidable and you have to
use you have to make an income so they
tax
it you have to pay people so they tax it
you if you have any
Investments that's like a lot of money
so they'll tax it if you have a
house they're going to tax it so
everything big they tax and the bigger
it is the easier it is to tax because if
if it's A1 trillion do
market and you say we just want 5% just
5% you get a ton of money so given that
the entire economy is going to move
toward Ai and information and robots and
away from labor and all those other
things I think the only thing that
they're going to have to tax will be
robots and Ai and if they do it soon you
won't know it here's why how much does a
robot
cost I don't know but if you said a
robot cost me I don't know
$5,000 let's say when the price comes
down um but then you taxed at 20% I'd be
like whoa
whoa I don't want to pay another $1,000
on my $5,000 robot that's too much
that's too much I vote you out of office
but suppose I never knew what a robot
cost in the first place and the first
time I ever saw one it was $10,000
$10,000 I might even say all right I
wish it were five but I still want that
robot so I buy it anyway because it
saves me money in the long run it would
actually save me money in the long run
um and then I don't know that it was
taxed
100% because I I don't know what a robot
costs same with AI you know I've got
this sense that an app should be 20
bucks and that's what you know that's
what they are but what happens when apps
go
away and AI is just built into your
phone then does Apple say you know your
phone used to be $1,000 but now has AI
it's a whole different deal now so now
it's a it's a $2,000 phone but what if
it's all taxes you wouldn't even know
the difference You' just be like oh I
guess AI phones cost
$22,000 so the future looks like massive
taxes on AI only because it's the only
thing that will be taxable that's also
really big and they can get away with it
so it's all about getting away with it
basically it'll get taxed like crazy
self-driving trucks are coming I think
that's inevitable because the
self-driving trucks can drive all night
and all day so they'd be in theory they
would be well three times more efficient
right because a human is going to do
eight hours a day but there's 38 hours
in the 24 hours so the robot should be
way cheaper to transport things so
you're worried about inflation are you
what happens if the transportation cost
goes down by
2/3 could totally happen because a robot
isn't going to cost much more than a
human
right um well let's say the the robot
part of the
truck might cost I'll just throw out a
number let's say say let's say making
your truck fully
robotic might cost you an extra $5,000
per
truck on a very expensive
truck whereas an employee who would be
the driver would be I don't know 100,000
a year with B benefits or whatever it is
so you're definitely going to replace
the
driver because of the economics and then
you're going to Triple the amount you
can ship in the same amount of time
and you might even bring them the cost
of electricity is cheaper than
gas so there are some there definitely
some things that could be happening that
could be lowering your your perceived
inflation RFK junior is talking about
our rigged system here here's some of
the things he said he said the FED is a
criminal agency and it's just a vacuum
cleaner for Wall Street to shift wealth
upward to a
kleptocracy they're all captured he says
the CIA is captured by the
military-industrial complex its function
is just to give us a pipeline of new
Wars Fair the FED is captured by Wall
Street to consolidate all the banks so
they all they're all too big to fail I
don't know about that it's all designed
to shift wealth upwards we financialized
our economy and destroyed our industrial
base and we need to reverse these
policies um he has a lot of hope he
thinks that uh Trump and Biden both
failed to fix anything in the
swamp and uh if you elect either Biden
or Trump you get more polarization more
debt and more chronic
disease
agreed
agreed that that's just the fact if you
elect either Biden or Trump you get more
polarization more debt and more chronic
disease I guarantee that's true
guarantee it's true sorry you know I do
think Trump is better choice than Biden
but he's going to run up the debt
and he's not going to fix food I mean
Trump's not going to fix the food supply
doesn't have any interest at
all so yes um if if what you want is to
fix that situation less
polarization and more I don't see how
how is RFK Jr going to not run up the
debt that's not an option is it because
he's more socialist than both the other
parties or both the other candidates
yeah so anyway that's his pitch it's a
strong
pitch uh speaking of Ukraine and theft
uh so zalinsky and Biden are working on
a plan that will be a 10-year plan for
funding Ukraine but somehow they're
going to make it so the next president
can't turn it off I don't know how you
do that to me that doesn't feel like it
could be a thing that the next president
can't turn off the funding how in the
world do you do that I think you'd do it
anyway I think if if they pass something
that prevents the president from
stopping the funding I think the
president would fire everybody who
writes the
checks oh there you go that's how you do
it it wouldn't matter what the law
is uh Trump could fire everybody who
signs a
check and then he just couldn't put it
out he he could tell them to close the
printing machines or whatever the hell
it is yeah
I think he I I don't think there's any
such thing as a debt which cannot be
canceled by the next
[Music]
president mandated spending I don't
believe it there's a clip going around
from sometime a long time ago where
George Soros is interviewed and he
admitted to having what he called a God
complex and that it was worse when he
was young but now it's not so bad
because he's actually acting it out and
acting like God
are you worried about
that how much how much of what we
observe could be explained by he has a
God
complex it would explain a lot wouldn't
it I don't think it explains everything
I think he's just in bed with the CIA in
the military industrial complex and he's
making money you know by knowing what's
going to happen and he sorted their bank
and stuff so I think it has more to do
with his entanglements with the other
powers structures in the world but he
might also have a God complex and that
might be how they control him if I were
going to control
Soros and I were an intelligence agent I
would say what are his
buttons and he already told you his
button is he has a God complex so if you
want to control him you say to him hey
I've got an idea how you can really
control everything you could be in
control of the uh the district attorneys
you could be control of Free Speech you
could be control of
immigration you just have to fund these
various entities and they'll do the rest
and then you're like
God so something who has a God complex
seems to me would be unusually easy to
manipulate because you just say I will
offer you exactly what feels the best
your God
complex and don't worry about the
details we'll take care of
that that would be called a psychopath
you say
yeah um even house Democrats are now
trying to get Colombia to uh to change
their University board because uh they
think the pro Palestinian encampments
Etc need to be tone down so even the
Democrats know that the people who they
thought were on their side are
destroying them in the
country there's an old
video looks like it's a new video but
it's an older video of the the Patriot
front having been stopped by police and
they all have the uh plastic tie
handcuff things on and they're all uh
kneeling in their little khakis and blue
shirts and white hats and they still
have their masks on and they're all
being very well behaved
and the whole thing looks
fake how do they do these arrests and we
still don't know their
identities and and nobody in the press
nobody in the Press still has ever tried
to follow their van to figure out you
know who they
are they do have a website that looks
like it was you know made in 10 minutes
by a website builder but it looks like
you know maybe some federal agent had to
put up a website or
something yeah everything about the
Patriot front seems pretty obviously
fake um now there is some indication
that the ADL and the Patriot front have
had some conversations about
merging to become uh one poorly dressed
hate
group because if you're poorly dressed
and you're a hate group probably you're
thinking well we could be bigger so I
think the ADL in The Patriot front
should just sort of
merge they might have some problems
agreeing on the
hat but uh they should just merge all
the hate groups should be in one group
um and yes I do call the ADL a hate
group because they attacked me and
called me a Holocaust denier in public
so it is my job to destroy the ADL any
way I
can remember what I said about Tik Tok
in
2020 you didn't believe that did you all
right
um there's a report that Hamas is ready
to do a
ceasefire to do some uh prisoner swaps
but president ex-president Trump um
again has perfectly captured the
situation now this is Trump by the way
this is a good um persuasion technique a
good persuasion technique is to say what
people are already thinking and feeling
all right so listen to see where Trump
says something that you were already
thinking and feeling
all right that's that's really the
secret to his technique wait for it
Trump wrote on Truth social he said
Israel will find very sadly that there
are far fewer hostages than currently
being thought that's why it's hard for
Hamas to make a deal they are no longer
able to produce the people because many
of them are gone Hamas is incapable of
holding Jewish people for a long period
of time without killing them and it will
only get worse zero leadership from
Biden October 7th would have never
happened if I were president not even a
small
chance do you see the
technique the the thing that we've all
been thinking but you don't want to say
it too
loudly is that you don't believe the
hostages are alive or Worse much worse
that the ones who are alive will have
stories if you're if you're a hostage
who's alive and you're going to tell a
story about getting raped every day
they're not going to return
you they're not returning those people
that the only people that are possible
to return are people that they have not
abused that
badly because they're they're going to
tell the stories about their uh their
imprisonment so you cannot let somebody
live if they're going to tell the
terrible story of their imprisonment so
this is what we've all been thinking but
it's it's just too horrible to say out
loud but Trump says it out loud and and
he goes completely direct he goes you
could not be more direct that Hamas is
incapable of holding Jewish people for a
long period of time without killing them
now that is so
direct and it's exactly what you're
thinking how in the world would Hamas
hold them for a long time like it's not
really
practical and I guess some of them were
prisoners who were do down to other
Terror groups that they don't have
direct control over I mean maybe but
maybe that's a cover for the fact that
they already killed them or that they
can't give them back so I don't know I
don't have a lot of hope that Israel is
going to get all of its people back but
it will give Israel an excuse to do
whatever it wants so the most likely
event is that Hamas will say oh yes how
about we give you all of our hostages if
you you know slow down with the war
stuff and then Israel will say okay
that's the deal give us all of the
hostages and then they're going to get
20 back and Hamas is going to say well
that's all we could
find and then Israel is going to say we
don't believe it you said you have 20
more so either produce the
bodies or we think you're still holding
them and therefore we're going to keep
doing exactly what we were doing before
which is attack Rafa which they've
already
done so I don't see any hope that a
prisoner exchange will stop any military
action except you know the day it
happens
basically
so H and do you buy the idea that
there's not even a small chance that
October 7th would have happened if Trump
were
president no way to know which makes it
a good claim for politics but it's
believable it's believable I do do think
that Trump's
unpredictability was exactly what they
needed for this situation exactly what
was needed because I think that they
could sort of know what Biden was going
to
do they didn't really sort of know what
Trump would have
done and before you act you usually have
to act with an assumption about how
everybody else will act if you act you
can't make that assumption with Trump he
is genuinely unpredictable and that's
his
strategy so who knows
maybe the US birth rate has dropped to
its lowest since
1979 with only 3.6 million children born
did we have 3.6 million children when we
leted in 10 million
immigrants is that roughly the number or
is it not 10 million in one year I think
it's 10 million in one year
right well uh why is the birth rate
going down I will give you a number of
different reasons number one men and
women both became way less attractive to
each other we got
fatter way
fatter and we became unpleasant because
of social media so even when you're with
somebody it doesn't feel like you're
with them have you had that situation
where you're with somebody and doesn't
even feel like you're with them they're
just looking at their phone and
um you know men got Alternatives with
porn so they got the phone they got the
porn they got the dating apps that are
making the most attractive guys turn
into and the most attractive
women getting used up by those most
attractive men and then they're less
marriageable uh we got the climate
change that's convincing people not to
have children if they're on the left we
got the finances that make it nearly
impossible to raise a family and if you
were to get uh divorced you would be
wiped out basically so I would say that
uh everything from the food I think
testosterone is half of what it used to
be so you lower the testosterone you
make everybody physically unattractive
you give them better Alternatives than
sex with each other porn and their
phones you you give them dating apps
that destroys the landscape of who finds
and gets with whom and it ruins their
their future marriage
ability and then you throw in climate
change it's going to kill you all so why
would you have
children it's not really a mystery why
the why the birth rates going
down it's
everything it's literally everything and
on top of that you've got Tik Tock doing
these videos for of CH childless adults
saying how great their weekends are
because they don't have any kids now I
have two feelings about that number one
they're totally right about how great
their weekend is without
kids
however I I'll just speak for
myself there's almost nothing I ever did
as a single person even if I was in a
relationship there was almost nothing I
ever did that was as fun as getting up
on a Saturday morning and watching my
stepdaughter at the time play
soccer in a non competitive you know uh
intramural kind of a
team no I there's nothing I did that was
more fun than
that and was it easy nope it was driving
and waking up and getting food and
making sure everybody's taking care of
and you got to bring chairs down and
cancel everything else and it's a lot of
work but there's nothing I did that was
more that I felt like deeply deeply
enjoyed just watching my stepdaughter
play soccer that's
it couldn't top
that uh the second thing with the best
like the best moments ever do you ever
think about what you would remember if
your life flashed in front of you like
you're dying I don't know if that really
happens but do you ever think like what
do you call your
life because I find that there are
moments that I call my life you ever
have that like I don't think um if if my
life were flashing before my eyes I
don't think I would think about my
dilber
career as you know 35 years of doing it
every day I don't think I would think
about it I'll tell you what I would
think
about if I
can I would think about watching Disney
movies with my step
kids that's it
that's what I would think
about but movies suck and those days are
over
so um not to end on
a on that note but that concludes my
uh presentation for today um I don't
know if I can talk to the uh locals
people separately yet I'm going to try
that feature but I'll see you in the man
cave if this doesn't work um
otherwise uh we'll see you tomorrow
morning thanks for joining everybody and
let's see if I can go private on the
locals people see if this
works
e
