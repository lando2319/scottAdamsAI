foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
can't even imagine more fun than that
really it's impossible so if you'd like
to
why does this chord only want to be in
one place
all right I've moved you now three times
all right I swear to God I'm going to
get you out of the way
so it's the last thing I do there we go
if you'd like to take this up to a level
that you can't even believe all you've
got to do is grab yourself a cup of mug
or a glass of tanker Charles's time a
canteen geograph flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous shipment happens now go
so good
well people always ask me Scott
why do you stay in California
when you know it's turning into a
fecal hellhole
yeah I just made that up a fecal
hellhole it's a
it's like a hell hole with a little
extra
a little extra fecal
but one of the reasons is California
looks like they're on the verge of
approving a bill decriminalizing The
Possession and personal use of a variety
of psychedelics including magic
mushrooms
I think it excludes bayoni
But it includes
DMT
DMT is on the legal use list
interesting
and
here here's the thing
I think you would agree with this
statement
no matter how much
things are going wrong
there is a theoretical amount of
hallucinogens they'll make you not care
now I shouldn't tell you my retirement
plan but it looks like I'll be retiring
to California if you know what I mean
a lot of people keep saying Scott why do
you want to you know take care of your
body and be healthy
all it's going to do is make you live
like into your 80s and nobody wants to
be in their 80s and still alive I mean
that's no good to which I say apparently
you've never done psychedelics
apparently you never have now I would
only recommend them in a legal
healthy environment don't do anything
illegal but when I'm 80
and these uh psychedelics are legal in
California which looks like that will be
the case
I'm never going to have a bad day
so that's my plan
the rest of you you might choose
differently and sit around in pain and
misery and loneliness until you die
now that's another plan and that's the
way most people do it but not me I'm
going to be visiting other dimensions
and you barely know I'm there that's my
plan for aging
well here's an update on my amazing book
reframe your brain
which I just noticed as a solid
five-star reviews now
for it for a while there was like it was
4.5 but now it's all the way up to solid
five
five the trouble is of course that the
Amazon is still showing a fake book
listing
so if you look for the hardcover
even though for a while it was fixed it
immediately went unfixed again
and the reason is that Amazon says they
cannot remove a link there's not even a
real link that you can't buy a book from
it and it's obviously a fake that
confuses people about the real link and
even under those conditions they can't
suppress the link
that's what they say
now do you think that's true
well it might be true they have some
policy but obviously they can do it
so once again we're in this weird phase
of History where you can't tell if this
is just part of the national
incompetence problem
but Amazon is unique in that they're
they're weirdly very good at most things
it's the best software I've ever seen
and
so I asked myself
what do I assume about the reason
because it's been a long time now and it
seems to be unfixable
they say I should go to my prior
publisher the one that canceled me
because they put their listing there and
therefore they're the only ones who can
edit it does that sound even slightly
true
that the only people who can edit an
existing listing are the ones who put it
there
so are you telling me that if it were
racist
Amazon couldn't remove it
is that what they're saying
if it was if it were literally like a
call to violence
it's not but if it were they couldn't
remove that right
if Obama published another book and
somebody front ran them and put like a
fake version up there and it was
confusing the real Obama book
do you think Amazon would say oh the
publisher doesn't want to change it so
it has to stay there no of course not
not even the slightest chance
no so what do you assume when there's a
system that seems to be giving you a
problem
and you're a person who's in the
political realm as I am
and the system is opaque I mean I can't
quite see what's going on behind the
curtain your operating assumption is it
has to be exactly what you think it is
it might not be
you know maybe a 50 50 chance or
something like that but you have to
assume that it's bad intentions and that
you're being targeted
does it mean it's true
but remember we live in a as you as you
said a zero trust environment
I didn't I'm not the one who chose to be
in a zero trust environment it just sort
of happened
so if you need if you want to buy the
book you're going to have to look pretty
hard for it
uh and it's almost impossible for me to
imagine
that this is accidental
yeah realistically it's probably a coin
toss 50 50. but my brain can't really
accept the other 50 because it's been
too long it's too obvious that it can't
be true
right would you agree it's really
obvious
that it can't be true what they've told
me but it could be incompetence
you can't rule them
all right
um
I I was just re-watching this clip from
uh Tucker Carlson he was giving a
podcast interview somewhere and he says
directly that he has personal knowledge
of people on CNN news as an example
and that the National Security reporters
he didn't name names are literally just
mouthpieces for the Pentagon and they're
not even slightly real journalists and
that it's known
and there's no doubt about it
now how many how many people who watch
CNN would be aware of that there's
somebody who worked there
can tell you for sure that the news
isn't real and they don't even try to
make it real on the national security
stuff they literally just
say what the Pentagon wants them to say
really but how many people know that so
I'm working on a News Guide a guide to
understand the news and I'll talk about
that in a minute
it's getting bigger
all right China is giving Apple some
trouble I sold my Apple stock
a month ago or so because I thought I
thought Apple was going to hit some
tough times and China was one of the
things I was concerned about and
apparently China is starting to push on
uh apple and they've banned iPhones for
government employees
but in China that's a lot of people
a lot of people so what does that sound
like does not sound like revenge for
tick tock being banned in American
government places
partly that but also Huawei introduced a
5G phone
that's a bit of a mystery because we
didn't think they had the chips to do it
and it looks like they're just pushing
Huawei because it's the Chinese phone
but uh yeah apple might have some
some difficulties there if they're
starting if they start to lose the
Chinese market
all right so once again I'm shocked that
the media is not covering this story
that President Joe Biden called the
Nazis that are Marching In Florida again
they're back
he called them very fine people
and
it's just hard to understand why would
he say that why would he call Nazis very
fine people in public
in public use of that yeah
by the way if somebody tells you he
didn't say that
you should send them the transcript
now you might need to tweak the
transcript but you could find it look
for the transcript of trump and
Charlottesville and just change the
names from Charlottesville to wherever
whatever Town these Nazis are in and
change Trump to Biden and provide that
transcript and then ask people if they
see Biden calling them fine people or
not
and they're going to look at that
transcript they're going to say
um obviously he very specifically
condemned them
and you'll say what what are you talking
about well look at the part you're not
telling me see this part you're not
mentioning he says directly I condemn
them completely
and I'll say that must be some other
reference to
something else I mean it's it's like
that was that was almost a full minute
later I don't even understand what
you're saying you obvious racist
so that's how I play it
um Trump is apparently claiming that his
uh black support after his mugshot went
up by
quadruple or quintupled he said his
black support has quadrupled or
quintupled
since his mug shot
how many of you think that that estimate
is somewhere in the ballpark
does that sound pretty close to what the
actual numbers are
four times
he actually tricked CNN into fact
checking him
it doesn't matter how many times he does
it they fall for it every time
so they fact checked him and said no no
way no way he's up four or five times we
checked the uh the polls and he's he's
only up like two three percent
in all the polls I think except one and
that might be within the margin of error
yeah so no way he's up four or five
times like that liar he's only up in
every poll
enough to win convincibly if they're
true
but they might be within the margin of
error
so we're not going to look at the actual
polls
no
you know when they compare what they
call Trump's lives
to Biden's lies
there's such a difference this is
obviously Hyperbole and it's obviously
to make them go check and then report
that it that his black support is up
do you know what is the best thing that
would help Trump's support among black
voters
name the one best thing that that could
happen
a lot of conversation about his increase
in Black support
even before it's there
but you want a lot of people talking
about it it's like I don't know is that
is that increase in Black support as
much as we think and and why like what
would be the cause of it and maybe we
should dig down a little bit and find
out what's what's happening with all
this more support from the black
community
it's classic Trump
it's stuff only he can do
so anyway I love just watching classic
Trump and then classic CNN falling for
it
this is very much the don't think of an
elephant trick
all right
I'd like you to not think of an elephant
don't
don't think of the elephant and then
they're all talking about the elephant
all right here's uh uh
I've been talking about trying to
deprogram a Democrat
from all the fake news and you know make
them more like reasonable actual
citizens and stuff and I'm not sure how
easy it would be seems like it'd be
pretty hard but I found one technique
that works right away
and this was tried once in Minneapolis
and involves uh four armed
carjackers who first beat you up and
threatened you and break your leg uh
bloody you in front of your children
and you barely get down Alive Now under
those conditions which did happen to a
Democratic party chairwoman just
recently she is much less inclined
to support defunding the police now
I don't know does that does that
surprise you that being violently
attacked in front of her own house
in front of her own house that's a key
here
um and uh was hurt pretty bad
and that's not funny
but it does tell you what would it take
to change a Democrat into a Republican
and turns out the answer is armed
robbery
uh with a danger of killing your
children
by putting your children in Mortal
danger appears to be enough to make
somebody say
huh I wonder if everything I've ever
said about the police is still tracking
just right
yeah so if you want to deprogram anybody
armed robbery carjacking we'll get it
done
speaking of Injustice Peter Navarro
economic advisor to Trump
is found guilty and he's going to go to
jail unless he his appeals work uh for
not complying with the subpoena for the
from the house Select Committee on the
January 6th stuff so he didn't comply
with the subpoena
for an illegitimate political process
so he's going to jail
nobody believes that that was a
legitimate process well I mean unless
you're a Democrat I suppose
because they don't they don't watch Real
News uh
but can you think of anything less Fair
than going to jail because you didn't
comply
with an obviously
um
and obviously corrupt process
yeah so I don't know how far he can take
it but he only has to drag it out until
a republican gets elected
presumably he would be instantly
pardoned
does that does that track do you think
if he just drags out
and we get a republican it wouldn't
matter which Republican wouldn't he be
pardoned immediately
I think he would so that's his best
strategy now speaking of strategy
apparently the Trump lawyers have the
following strategy
that because the legal attacks on Trump
are a little bit weird and unique
that they will have infinite technical
objections that have to be ruled on and
they they basically decided directly
we're basically just going to bury you
in technical objections each one has to
be put through the process and we're
gonna we're gonna make this last until
he's president
so he can pardon himself
and that that's the actual process
that's the actual process
they're they're really just playing it
for a stall
in both cases why are they needing to
stall
it's a direct admission that the current
process is not judicial and fair that
you would have to you'd have to have you
have to get past that to get anything
that looks like justice
that the justice system is just biased
and broken
so that's shocking anyway
uh RFK Jr was uh
I don't want to say complaining they'll
say describing that the DNC is changing
their rules about the primary to make it
basically impossible for any Challenger
to challenge Biden in the primary so
they're they're tweaking the rules about
the Iowa New Hampshire primary
which one imagines that RFK JR could do
well
as long as you know there was no
fiddling with the rules so they're going
to fiddle with the rules
and and they make it basically
impossible for an outsider to win
now what did they just do to RFK Jr now
that he knows for sure
that his own team is going to prevent
him from winning for sure there's no
doubt about it
what do you do if you're him
he basically says he owes his supporters
a path
in other words he can't take the money
and run for president if he can't
describe a way to get there and the
current system doesn't give him away
he's not saying third party yet is he
he's not saying the words
but can't you imagine it
now I saw Paul begalla
with his gigantic bug eyes
you know the bug eyes when somebody's
lying
Paul mcgala eyes
Adam Schiff eyes
yeah but sometimes Paul bagalis has some
something that is wise and true
and I'll tell you what he said and it's
not a bad take
he says that Trump's base is the most
solid base
anybody's ever seen that the indictments
didn't hurt him you know the January 6
didn't hurt him nothing hurts him so
he's got 45 guaranteed
FK Junior too
right normally that would matter
does it matter with Trump supporters
I don't know I don't know so I feel like
uh so bagala says that it doesn't matter
who it is any Third Party candidate will
make Trump the next president
and the idea is that nobody from his
base is going to defect
but somebody from the other base will
it's it's a lot easier to imagine a
Biden person saying you know what I just
can't vote for Biden
I'd rather lose
but I got to vote for a Democrat
you you know or somebody who's like one
so no I'm not going to run if I read
I'll get assassinated in 10 minutes
all right
so it's weird to be a demo imagine being
a Democrat and knowing that you're not
going to be given a choice
let me think about it right yo Michael
schellenberger said this about their
attempt to use the 24th
the 14th Amendment to remove Trump from
the ballot
so as Michael schellenberger accurately
pointed out was it no no is uh Joel
Pollock pointed it out this is the same
system as uh Iran
right if you get to vote but you only
get to vote for who they tell you you
can vote for
that's a ram that's their exact system
and now they're doing it not only maybe
in the general election
or by keeping Trump off the election but
they will also do it by keeping RFK Jr
off off the effective effectively out of
the election by rule changes
do you think the Democrats are aware
that they're keeping their own candidate
you know somebody in their own party off
the ticket
so that it's not an option for them
are they aware of that
yeah yeah the Democrats are basically an
Iranian system
uh and if you throw in the super
delegates that's even more Iranian isn't
it
because the super delegates kind of
guarantee that
doesn't really matter what the voters
wanted
the super delegates have extra votes and
they're appointed by the party that's my
understanding and
so they're the ones who always are the
dominant voice of who becomes the
nominee so it's not really even the
voters getting involved
you know I think that would be a good
attack
is just to point out in the cleanest
possible way to Democrats especially
during imagine saying this during a
debate
you know Republicans you might not like
our policies
but I'll tell you one thing we're
dedicated to the Democrats or not which
is giving the voters a choice
you know you could actually vote for any
one of our primary candidates
there are a lot of them they all have a
full shot
but on your side you're trying to
restrict not only who's on the election
who can run in in the case of trump but
you're even restricting who can run on
your own team
when you're when your main guy is so old
that not a single person
is missing the fact that he's not quite
all there
right
so I would think that you could make
Democrats really mad at Democrats by
telling them that their freedom is being
taken away by democrats
and that what they get for that is that
they're a number as Newt Gingrich points
out there are a number of things which
the citizenry
is about 70 to 80 percent aligned on
and it's not happening imagine that we
live in this you know Republic that's
with a democratic element to it and
the public can want something by 70 to
80 percent
um
you know
majority
and our Congress won't give it to us
what does that mean
well it means that there's no interest
in the people's will being the dominant
thing now I'm totally in favor of the
public not getting their way in the fog
of War
that's actually the the time that's the
exact time you don't want the public
getting involved let's say the country
is attacked
I don't want any voting
no voting you know you the president
just has to take over
set the military on its way you know do
his thing
but if it's something we all understand
such as can schools talk to your kids
about
things you as a parent don't want them
to talk to your kids about without your
permission and understanding now that's
something that parents largely are all
in the same on the same page right they
don't want somebody raising their kid in
a way that's opposite the way they would
have raised them
but we don't even get that
the most basic thing and we understand
that completely that's not like the fog
of War
that's a topic we all understand
and yet you can't get that so whatever's
happening is certainly not
you know because Democrats want it it's
just something that's happening to them
um
so Vivek was did a big
big big post on X about the 14th
Amendment and one of the things that he
claims which I also saw in the Wall
Street Journal so he's not the only one
saying it is that the 14th Amendment
which essentially says that you can't be
you can't be elected
I don't think it's just for president
but I think you can't run for office if
you're you know a designated
insurrectionist or something now
apparently this came from the Civil War
it had to do with you know the people
would uh literally been part of the
Civil War
so if you're putting the country
together maybe they said themselves we
don't want these troublemakers and so
they had this rule to keep people out
who had literally been part of an armed
you know Civil War
so that's what they were thinking of
with the rule an armed Civil War
and they're trying to use this for their
protest on January 6 to keep Trump out
of office oh he's our insurrectionist
just like the Civil War
all right but apparently the way the
rule was written it did not include an
elected president
so it's per it seems pretty clear that
it was written for people that he might
appoint but not for himself
so
there isn't the slightest chance that
this is well who knows I'm not a lawyer
but it doesn't look like this is even a
good try it's the sort of thing you
could only even attempt if you owned the
media and you owned the courts
because if you didn't think you owned
the media in the courts you wouldn't
even try it it's too stupid you couldn't
possibly succeed on this path
but to try it
so they must think they do own the
courts and they must or at least the
lower courts and they must think that
they do own the media at least for the
people they're talking to
and I think they're right
well speaking of the media and their
fake news have I ever mentioned that the
first story out of a war zone is always
fake
and if I ever mentioned that all news
about public figures is fake
all of it
now it might be based on some true facts
but the context is always fake
so if you had uh something about a war
that also was something about a public
figure
what are the odds that the first report
is true
zero zero
because the fog of war is almost always
untrue yeah anything that's like a new
report out of a war zone and anything
about a public figure
is almost certainly not true in its
completeness right in context if you put
them together
as in the story about Elon Musk
allegedly turning off starlink uh in a
zone that the ukrainians wanted to use
to send a drone submarines to attack a
Russian Fleet it was I think there were
the fleet was all in the same place or
something or a lot of and
the original story
from CNN I think was that Elon turned
off
the coverage in the area they needed for
the attack
because he could control where starlink
is effective and then they had to cancel
their attack
do you think that was true
no
no it wasn't true
the the thing the area that they needed
covered with starlink has never been
covered
so they asked them to turn it on
to support a major escalation of the war
such an escalation that it could have
taken out the Russian Fleet
it basically could have been Russia's
Pearl Harbor
how does the country respond when you
take out their naval fleet
why did we respond
we actually nuked Japan
twice
twice and didn't we Nukem did we Nukem
only because
that was the way to end the war
well some people say that because that
we would have won anyway
it just would have been bloodier and
taken longer bloodier on our side and so
some people said no no we just didn't
care how many died we just didn't want
to lose any more Americans
uh maybe here's my take on it we nuked
Japan because they attacked Pearl Harbor
everything that happened in between was
irrelevant to that
they attacked our homeland
sank our Fleet you're going to get nuked
sorry
everything in between didn't matter
you're gonna get nuked
especially in those days
so
is if this version of the story is true
that Elon didn't turn them off he simply
did not agree to turn them on
to support the biggest escalation of the
war we would have seen probably now even
even the question of what those drones
were going to do
still fog of War so maybe it wasn't a
big attack
but they're saying it was I don't know
it's hard to know but if that's the
information that musk was working on
that they were going to take out much of
the Russian Fleet
as a preparation to taking Crimea
and most just said I'm out
yeah you could do your War without me if
you're going to do that
now
did he just stop a nuclear war
isn't it weird
that someday when the the story of Elon
Musk is written
it probably won't include he stopped a
nuclear war
because you can't be sure because you
don't know what would have happened if
he'd done something else
but he may have just stopped a nuclear
war
one person
we have some really brave people
in the public sphere at the moment like
in seriously brave people RFK Jr
obviously Trump obviously Elon Musk
obviously and any of us who are getting
canceled
are you know willing to take an arrow in
the back for something we think is worth
doing
so
I don't know to me this was kind of
awesome and I don't even have an opinion
about whether it was militarily good or
bad or geopolitically good or bad I just
like the fact that when he was asked
as a private citizen
he told he told the military of NATO
basically and Ukraine to go pound sand
and they had to
I kind of like it
it's pretty baller
but we'll probably find out more about
that and who knows maybe it'll even even
the decision might reverse we don't know
but I do think that elon's instinct
that since nothing much is going to
change no matter what happens
that we should be talking instead of
escalating that makes perfect sense now
remember I told you uh you remember my
was it a prediction I don't know if it
was prediction but I said that the big
variable of what's going to happen in
the Ukraine situation is probably the
number of Ukrainian soldiers that they
can put in the field
and that that number might you know just
from the deaths an injury is my Diplo a
sustainable level and that could be the
big turning point in the war
but I said
there would be an adjustment if they
were running out of humans
they would adjust it to be more
technological
and right after I said that
it turns out that there was going to be
a fleet reportedly don't know if it's
true but reportedly a fleet of drones
but submarine drones
that was going to attack the fleet now
presumably there were going to be a lot
of them
more than one
so that there would be enough that some
got through I guess you know kind of
like a wave of Technology sending on
them so
why we haven't seen that in the air yet
might be because they can jam them
easier or something now here's the other
thing I found out about starlink Wall
Street Journal I think that
starlink apparently
can keep ahead of the jamming
and the the other beans of communication
over there the Russians are jamming
successfully but somehow the the
starlink engineers can came out of the
jamming I don't know how they're doing
it
so it really wouldn't even be useful in
the war zone if they could jam it
but that's pretty impressive so I think
you're going to see
just as you saw a you know a larger
threat than we've seen that would be the
largest underwater drone threat we've
ever seen if it was going to be a multi
multi-ship attack and it sounds like it
was
um but how long before we see the the
sky just blackened with drones
because you know we've got we must have
thousands
don't you think we have like 20 000
drones just sitting in a warehouse you
know waiting waiting to be
operationalized I think so by now
so I think when the big push comes if
there is going to be one
that you're going to see uh drones like
you've never seen drones
that's what I think
all right
um I started to develop what I call a
guide to understanding the news that's
my working title but I'll tell you the
uh the categories
so suppose somebody just didn't
understand how to evaluate what they see
in the news to know what's true and what
isn't some of this you've heard before
but I need to put I'm going to write it
up eventually and put it in one place
um so the first thing you need to know
if you're new with this is the
designated Liars
the people who they they put in front of
the camera when the normal people just
can't lie that much
like all politicians can exaggerate and
Hyperbole and that but what do you just
have to tell a complete lie a thing you
know did not happen and look in the
camera and act like it did oh yeah that
totally happened I went into the the
skiff and I saw it myself
when you need that kind of person there
are only certain personalities who are
willing to do that
so if you knew who they were
the moment you saw him on TV you'd say
to yourself oh that's a signal that's a
signal that these are not serious people
so here's a starting list Adam Schiff
Eric swalwell
John Brennan
James Clapper
Lawrence tribe I'm adding him
fill bump
Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL
and I'm going to add Abby Phillips of
CNN
she's a promoter of the fine people Oaks
um
so that's the starting point now you're
probably going to say to me but Scott
oh Goldman
yeah Goldman's
look at that Goldman
who I'm not going to add is leadership
so I'm not going to add a Pelosi or a
Schumer
because because they're involved in all
questions
right so they're not a good signal they
might also be Liars but they don't
signal anything because they're involved
in everything
all right but I'll need some
no it's harder than you think and the
news people
you never know what they actually
believe is true
oh yeah
well I don't want to just say it's all
the all the hosts of MSNBC and all the
hosts of CNN because one of my other uh
one of my other categories here is which
entities are true
so the fake news on the left the ones
you have to worry about
would be the New York Times The
Washington Post MSNBC CNN and the
Associated Press
I would say that none of them are even
slightly credible on political news
would you agree
none of them are
at all and I would say on the right
you'd be looking at Fox News and Gateway
pundit
as your fake news places
would you agree with that
now the trouble with Gateway pundit is I
think they sometimes have scoops
but more often it's stuff that doesn't
check out well I don't know if it's more
often it's just yeah they're they're
lower credibility entities
uh
yeah maybe NPR I don't want to just I
didn't want to just list every
left-leading entity
right that because you could go deeper
basically every entity has a bias so I
don't want to just say here's all the
biases I want the ones that are really
signals you know the ones you have to
worry about because if it's not in the
New York Times in the Washington Post
it probably won't be anywhere else
right but if it's anyone in one of these
entities it's probably going to be
everywhere
all right so
and then of course the most important
part was I was teaching I'll teach
people how to know how credible any
story is based on its elements
for example
these are things that are probably true
not necessarily but just a hint that's
probably true if one side either the
left or the right hides the story
so it's different if one side says it's
true and the other side says it's not
but if one just won't mention it
it's probably true
probably true
all right if both sides reported the
same
if the left and the right entities
reported the same probably true
probably true
How about if all studies
for years and years are pointing in the
same direction
like every time you do a study no matter
how you slice it no matter what you
study
same direction
for example cigarettes causing lung
cancer
I'm pretty sure that every way you study
that you get the same answer
that means it's probably true but not
necessarily
because we've seen for example alcohol
is good for you in small quantities
the the those studies would forever but
of course were not true
about uh
if if one narrative predicts better than
the other
that's more likely true or you could
treat it as true so there are some
frames that just don't or narratives
that just never predict anything and
some that predict everything
so if you if you hear one that predicts
everything it's one of those types such
as follow the money
right follow the money is a pretty good
thing for predicting
so it also is a good thing for truth
um
suppose you have a witness
who has direct knowledge of a situation
and is under oath
and they're public you know who they are
they're under oath and they have direct
knowledge they didn't hear her from
somebody they saw themselves pretty good
pretty good not guaranteed if you have
two of them and they're not friends or
something and they've seen it from
different angles say the same thing
that's much more likely to be true
all right and if you have witnesses plus
documents
then you're in real good shape so if
you've got somebody who is there they're
public they saw it directly but also
there's an email or something that
supports them you're you're in pretty
good shape in that case but that's rare
that the the hunter laptop and that
stuff that does fall into that category
of direct Witnesses and lots of
documents that's about as true as
anything can get
um here are some things that are more
like a coin flip you know could it be
true maybe not one scientific paper
that has not yet been peer-reviewed uh
you don't really know anything about it
how about one scientific paper that has
been peer-reviewed exactly the same the
peer review does not give you any
benefit in terms of credibility we used
to think of that and they could find
like really big mistakes
but if somebody publishes a scientific
paper without a peer review that sort of
is a peer review
because everybody's going to look at it
and you would pretty soon see if there
are strong objections
so it's sort of a bad peer review but
it's kind of one
how about I have some things of
meta-analysis
if they say well the individual studies
weren't that strong but when we summed
them together and you did our magic
called a meta-analysis
the the results are very clear once you
do the meta-analysis definitely One
Direction
that is uh no more than a coin flip
meta-analysis is somebody deciding
what's in the study and what isn't so
it's not a science it's somebody
deciding what's in and what isn't
50 chance that they got it right
um How about if there's a video or audio
of an event
that people question really happened
video
and or audio of the event
no more than a 50 chance
because for every everything that's a
real video of a real event just the way
it happened there's at least one that is
misleading
at least one maybe more because video is
the most misleading thing in the world
remember when we used to think a
photograph doesn't lie
I'm old enough to think that was real oh
a photograph doesn't lie of course I
photograph lies
a video lies even better and audio lies
best of all they're all liars yeah so 50
50 even if there's a video or an audio
all right and here are the ones where
you could pretty much
make a lot of money if you could bet on
these being fake
so these are the things that probably
are fake
anything where lots of money is involved
the the news is never real when lots of
money is involved
whether it's a war
or a pandemic as soon as there's lots of
money involved
you just don't believe anything
um
let's see how about if both CNN and Fox
News say something didn't happen then it
probably didn't
uh if you've got one anonymous source
probably fake
one anonymous source is almost
like the classic
fake news one anonymous source and
usually you'll see that in a book
well there's a book about what happened
behind the curtains I've got this one
anonymous source they're never real
how about two Anonymous sources
we don't know who either are but there
are two of them and they say the same
thing
nope
probably not true
they're just adding the second fake one
so it sounds more true now there's no
credibility to two Anonymous people
no credibility
how about uh the only photos you can get
are fuzzy
you just can't get a clean photograph
Bigfoot UFOs
probably not true probably not true okay
all those photographs can't get a good
one they're always a little bit fuzzy
yeah uh how about a randomized
controlled trial funded by
somebody has an interest in the outcome
it's randomized and controlled that's
the gold standard
you can't complain if it's randomized
and controlled and it's a big study
yes you can if it's funded by somebody
who has an interest in the outcome it
has no evidentiary value
none
you just imagine you imagine that you
can't get that many scientists to be
weasels
but we know we can you can get the
entire world of scientists to be as
Weasley as you want you just threaten
their money
uh well you'll never get a job again
unless you agree with the mainstream
okay I agree
it's easy
how about uh
the best argument is that the experts
are on the same side
that's our best argument I'll get i'll
grant you that the data we're using
people question it some people say it's
good some people say it's bad but the
thing you should listen to is that the
experts have a good sense of which which
ones are good and what's bad you know
you as a layperson can't really tell but
the experts they know which studies to
believe
and which studies not to believe so
under those conditions if somebody says
90 I'll just pick a number let's say
somebody says 97 of uh experts are on
the same side
but the data is in question by other
people
yeah that means that they have a
monetary interest in it and therefore
their opinions are worthless
yeah 97 of experts agree in the context
in the context where the data itself
that they're looking at
you're not quite confident is real
in that condition 97 percent of
scientists agree just means they're
being paid to agree
indirectly meaning they'd never get a
job if they disagreed
that's all it means so you should
reverse your your instinct when you see
97 percent of experts agree that should
tell you that it's a fake it shouldn't
tell you it's true
right if one scientist gives you a a
great argument
that would be a little bit more
persuasive one person with a great
argument that you could check it's like
oh let me check that one he's right
about that
but 97 I mean that's just a huge raging
signal of fakery
here's some other tricks
um
so you're the ones that I call Pure
propaganda
if your news mentions that there are a
lot of heat deaths because of climate
change
but they never mentioned how many cold
deaths there are so that you know both
the costs and the benefits
if they always leave out one of those
sides they always leave out the costs
like always
or they always leave out the benefits
always when it would be easy to mention
that they both exist that's propaganda
so if somebody tells you we're in
trouble because some places are getting
hotter
without mentioning that
that would be better for some places
that's not any kind of news that's just
propaganda
so look for the look for the dog not
barking the part they leave out
if they're arguing by analogies instead
of data
that's a sign for no real argument
people don't use analogies when they
have real arguments
you can use analogy just to paint a
general picture so somebody knows what
you're talking about but that's not the
argument
right an analogy can you know get you in
the the general zip code of what you're
both talking about
but it can't it can't win a debate
because the analogy is act is literally
a different thing
right you can't learn about this thing
by looking at a different thing
um
so if you see people leading on
analogies such as this is just like
Hitler
it's probably not real
um if you see too much what about is um
that's a sign of a weak argument
if the response to criticism is what
about ISM that's the first response now
what about ism is perfectly legitimate
if it's not your only point
if it's your go-to then you don't have
an argument
there's no argument if that's if you
have to rely on what about ISM you don't
have anything
all right how about
and here are some tricks that the
general public doesn't know about you
know about all these uh when the
headline doesn't match the story because
you know people don't read the story
they just look at the headline
yeah that that trick is just so classic
and if you are worried about the
headline not matching the story where do
you look in the body of the story to
find the part where they kind of admit
the headline doesn't match the story
it's at the end
right so if you so the way to read the
news is you read the headline and then
ignore it
because headlines don't match stories
you read the first paragraph
because all good writers is pretty much
everybody in the news business will tell
you the basic thing in the first
paragraph
which might be the misleading thing
might be misleading but it'll give you
the thing everything that's in the
middle you can ignore
and then you go to the last paragraph
where they'll tell you that everything
that you read was
the very common it'll be like
uh we found out that the climate change
is going to make the butterflies turn
vicious the butterflies the scientists
say will be attacking people and tearing
their lungs out so we're all going to
die from the butterfly attacks and you
get to the last paragraph it'll be but
it should be noted that butterflies do
not have the mass or strength to hurt
anybody whatsoever and we would just use
this exercise and make them go away
and the whole story was nothing
yeah like they'll debunk their own story
in the last paragraph you have to read
the last paragraph of anything in the
news written
all right uh then you know what the uh
the old uh correction method
say something you know isn't true it
becomes the big story for days and days
and weeks and then you issue a
correction because you knew it wasn't
true you're like well well correction
didn't mean it and nobody sees the
correction
so the fake news just lives forever
Corrections don't matter so you see that
trick then there's the wrap up spear
Nancy Pelosi
uh talks about uh see if I have this
right because I may be conflating the
wrap-up smear with a different thing but
I think they're the same where where
somebody will leak to a journalist
something that's not true
the journalists will write it as if it
is true
and then the politician who leaked it
says well don't look at me it's in the
news
I mean the New York Times just wrote
about it so how about you leave me alone
and go talk to the New York Times why do
they say it's true I mean I said it's
true first but now they're agreeing with
me obviously the news agrees with me I'm
right you're wrong
that's what the wrap-up smear is Right
Where You launder your fake opinions
through the fake news so that you can
say oh not me
oh then there's also the 24-hour rule
yeah
fog of War 24-hour rule
would this be a good book it shouldn't
be a book it should be more like a
pamphlet
but but this would be useful to train
people how to read the news right I
think it would be
all right here's another one um
that uh you need to know what is science
and what is not science
because because a lot of our dues and a
lot of the politics is based on what we
think of science
so you take climate change
climate change the science is that CO2
is a greenhouse gas you could test it in
lots of different ways and pretty much
whenever you test it you see uh yep it's
a greenhouse gas meaning meaning that if
it's in the atmosphere it's one of
several things that would keep the heat
from escaping the Earth so it trapsody
but it's not the only thing clouds blah
blah blah right so
if somebody says that the basic science
is that CO2 is a greenhouse thing so it
should cause some warming that would be
science
but if they make a model to project
where it will be in 50 years
that is not science
that is marketing
sometimes propaganda
the the best it can do if it were
legitimate which it isn't in this case
is tell you the cone of possibilities
but nobody can predict anything in five
years
much less 50. you can't really predict
anything in one year most of the time so
if you imagine that the projection
models are actually science you would be
completely misled about what's going on
they're the marketing arm so the people
who do science can get more money
and scare you
sorry Don it's probably hurting your
head we'll just get rid of you
no
Don I need to make Dawn go away
goodbye Don
all right
so here's the question
um I know that this is a repeat for most
of you
uh it's slow news day so trying to try
to make something useful out of this but
do you think you could reprogram anybody
so that their politics was different
simply because they learned how to
interpret the news
do you think that's a thing
or do you think nobody would ever change
their mind because they wouldn't they
would just look at it and say oh this
isn't true
well what I'd like is here's the
ultimate the ultimate expression that
you could grade any story
by these characteristics
so so you could say for example uh let's
say if somebody
posts a story that's in some publication
you could leave a comment
that just picks out the way the reasons
that make it low confidence like well
it's an ominous Source blah blah and
some kind of like thing you could just
paste in every time somebody does that
like a community note so one of the
things that Community notes doesn't do
is they don't tell you how to and how to
look for problems they'll just tell you
if a fact is wrong which is useful
but it doesn't tell you stuff like well
an anonymous source should not be
believed
right they might just tell you there is
or is not an anonymous source or or that
it was or was reported that there was
one
how do we get afraid of greenhouses
people who think I have a thin skin
that that that's the NPC take
we all got a friend you gotta if anybody
doesn't like anything they're they're
blamed of having a thin skin
that's the NPC attack the NPCs say
you're a flip-flopper
you're a fence sitter
uh and you you have thin skin
those are all the lowest level of
analytical ability
yeah wrinkly skin Maybe
foreskin well
that's another story
so here's what we might need to do
if if we end up putting on a mask
Rebellion
which I think is likely we're going to
have to find groups of people who want
to go into places at the same time
so in other words
you know if you were if you could find a
way to agree with your anti-massed
neighbors
that you're all going to go grocery
shopping between you know seven and
eight pm
and then you just show up in Mass
without masks
and nobody's going to bother you if
there are enough of you so you have to
go in numbers
the the problem is if you go as a onesie
they'll kick you out
yeah basically a flash mob
so you want to just break everybody you
can break right away
but the the cleverness of how it's being
rolled out
is pretty good because they're they're
making sure it's the people you don't
want to boycott so first it'll be like
medical professionals
and you know you saw me I'm like uh I'm
not going to attack medical
professionals
I'm just not going to do it so you know
if
you might not like to hear this but if
my health care provider
wants me to wear a mask inside a Health
Care Facility
I'm not going to second-guess them
right I don't think it's necessary
especially if I don't have symptoms
because the whole point is you're
supposed to wear the mask if you're the
one who has the symptoms but now the
latest information is that asymptomatic
spreading was basically zero right it
was people with symptoms
so my Common Sense tells me I wouldn't
need a mask in a medical facility but
that's not where I'd pick a fight like I
don't think the nurses and doctors need
that kind of in their lives
like let them do what they can so I'll
put up with that annoyance and I know I
think the government knows that
they know that if your doctor requires
it you're gonna you're gonna fold
because that's not the fight you want to
have then they're going to go for like
the Airlines and the airlines will say
hey it wasn't our decision the
government just made us do it what
choice do we have you'd be like oh
Airlines
oh I guess it's not really your fault
so I I and that'll probably be in the
military right and I'll be like oh I
can't really boycott the military
so so they're going to sneak it in all
the places that you can't boycott
and then they're going to start
threatening the big companies you know
with all kinds of things but at some
point you're gonna have to destroy a big
entity
or more
so you're gonna have to take out like a
whole Fortune 500 company you're just
going to bring some company to its knees
totally uh but it won't be until it's
some
some capitalistic free market company
this gets involved but it has to be
brutal
that we have to actually destroy a
corporation that doesn't deserve it
right so when when we do it and probably
will take down a big company it has to
be a company that it doesn't matter if
they deserve it and it doesn't matter
how much you like them
and it doesn't matter how much you like
their products it doesn't matter if your
brother works for the company you just
got to take them out of business
because
this war war has casualties and this
would definitely be a war in my opinion
um
and I also think that's the point where
I would lose all allegiance to America
basically
I mean I wouldn't be a traitor but uh it
would be hard to love my country if they
make me put a mask on again or try
that that would be a hard stretch for me
all right that's all I got for you today
YouTube thanks for joining
maybe the news will be more interesting
tomorrow
bye for now
