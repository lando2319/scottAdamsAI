good morning everybody
and welcome
to the best thing that ever happened to
anybody who's ever been born
anywhere it's called coffee with scott
adams
every now and then i like to remind my
audience
just in case you're wondering
that i have more than one t-shirt that
looks just like this one
some of you may be concerned
that i only own one t-shirt
but no
i own
about a dozen of these
and
i call it my uniform
see if you can get people to think that
you're dressing one way because you have
a look
i'm talking about the steve jobs look
talking about the mark zuckerberg look
you know he wears the hoodie or the
black shirt
yeah the trick
if you can convince people that you have
a look
all of your problems are solved if you
know what i mean
now don't go full elton john
you don't want to convince people that
your look
is an elton john you know over the top
needs props and all that stuff that's
way too much work
if you're going to do a uniform
and a look and a brand
go for basic
save you a lot of time hey who came here
for the simultaneous sip besides
everybody
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea's done a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
how much do i like coffee
a lot
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes all of you better
looking a little bit sexier
definitely smarter it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens right
now
go
yes
i would like to pay respect
to my uh
what would it be my ethnic origins
by doing the whitest thing
anybody's ever done after the
simultaneous sip
now feel free
to enjoy your own cultural heritage
and celebrate the way that makes the
most sense
for
whoever you are
be you
born in america or born somewhere
else use your cultural heritage and join
me now doing your own after the sip
celebration i will be doing the whitest
white person guy celebration ever and it
goes like this
now i hope that wherever you were
you did something that was as perfectly
suited to your cultural background as i
did
somebody dabbed that's exactly right
well rasmussen uh
has a poll
uh asking uh should the democratic party
be more like biden or more like harris
what do you think democrats said
uh the democratic party should be more
like biden 36
but only 11 percent thought harris
and so
how's the progressive wing of the
democratic party looking
not so good
now so good you want to hear some more
bad news for
the progressive part
um i was asked a question on the locals
platform just before i went live on
youtube
they get they get a little extra over on
locals it's a subscription service
and i was asked
what has the worst recent murder rate
we're going to compare two regions i'm
going to ask you this question it's a
serious question
it's not a rhetorical question
i actually don't know the answer to it
and the question is
has the the death rate and the murder
rate let's say
has it been worse in the last few months
in chicago
or in the uh occupied
separatist regions of ukraine
which has been the more deadly place
now
it kind of doesn't matter what the
answer is kind of doesn't matter what
the answer is
it's the fact that we can even ask that
question
and it's not a joke i actually don't
know the answer that question
i don't know maybe it'll be a crossover
point but if i had to bet
i think i'd put my money on
chicago because you know i assume
there's shelling and there's chicanery
and there's
you know false flags and all kinds of
stuff happening in the separatist
regions
but
but they didn't kill as many people as a
weekend in chicago does
am i right i don't know if i'm right
but you seem to think i am and
that's good enough
you know we live in a subjective reality
and
while i strive to be correct and right
about everything
i will settle for you agreeing with me
because it feels the same
on my end anyway so thank you for that
uh speaking of wokeness uh
it's it's a story that the media is
talking about this story
which is the newsweek in l.a times
are both recently warning
democrats
that they better get over the wokeness
because they're looking at this uh
one anecdote here i guess the situation
where in san francisco that the
democrats voted out some school board
members
for being too woke and not being useful
enough
and
the striking part about it is that they
were overwhelmingly voted out the the
wokesters were just driven out by even
democrats because it's a democratic city
so that seems like a pretty big story
but are things getting better or worse
for the locust of the woke well
shall i continue
it's it's turning out to be a really bad
year to be woke
am i right
part of it is because trump is less than
the news
because there's not a natural
enemy you know that's just really
salient at the moment
so if you just let the the wokeness
exist on its own
it just looks like
you know
toxic bile
and just you know it's like an acid to
eating itself but if if trump were in
the news every day
then the wokeness would have something
to play off of you know some kind of a
productive contrast but when you take
the contrast away and it just has to be
looked at on its own
nobody likes it
well that's the exaggeration but
it's not so popular
and that brings us to grenada tonberg
and i tweeted yesterday that
greta tunberg caused this mess
and by this mess i mean ukraine
now do you all see the connection
because i'm not joking
greta tunberg
she sort of caused the ukraine war
does everybody see it
i can explain it if okay there i get a
few no's there so let me explain it
so it goes like this
if we didn't have greta
climate change wouldn't be you know as
potent a topic as it is
that's no that's a
that's a presumption on my part right so
that part's speculative
but i think most of you would agree with
that that she's she's uh
turbo charged the topic she's added a
lot most people would agree with that
now if
climate change did not have such a
let's say persuasive quality to it
how would trump's policy about energy
look compared to biden's
biden didn't really have a choice did he
you know if you're a democrat
don't you have to go full tundberg
or or at least move in that direction he
he didn't go full tonberg by any means
but he had to be pushed in that
direction right
so
one of the things that trump would have
done that
we know for sure
that uh
biden did not do
is promote domestic energy production in
the united states because biden wants to
be more green and save the world and be
more greta tunberg
and trump was more
i think this climate thing changed thing
was a chinese hoax to
slow down our economy
let's pump uh oil and
gas as much as we can build some
pipelines and be independent and build
up our economy and by the way when you
substitute
gas natural gas for coal it reduces your
emissions
so
trump who was criticized for saying that
climate change was a chinese hoax
i think we're all sure
even the democrats would say this is
true
he would have kept the domestic energy
production high
which means that prices for energy would
have been lower
which means that your inflation would be
lower
under trump
in that one way
yet
putin would have far less money to be
adventurous
and he would
basically have less power
because if europe needed to get a
different source of gas for a while
it might cost more
but if you took some of the inflation
out of it the more wouldn't be as much
as it would be now
so you've got
a situation in which energy is sort of
the most important product because
there's not enough of it which makes
putin
the most important person
because he's got an army and he's got
energy
he's got the two things that matter the
most today
so
quite reasonably
you could say that the connection
between greta tunberg
and her influence which was very
effective
definitely put pressure on democrats
the democrats definitely reduced
energy production the reduction in
energy production definitely increased
the cost of energy
which definitely increased the profits
for russia
which definitely increased their
strategic power
which definitely increased their
confidence
which almost certainly was a major
factor
in getting exactly where we are now
who who disagrees with that analysis now
i'm not going to say it's the only
variable right
you know maybe putin would have done
what putin was going to do
but
you can see the connection can't you it
does seem like
it's
maybe 20 of the story
and that's pretty big
yeah i'd say it's 20 of the story i mean
climate change itself not just greta
right so you know nothing is
there there's no analysis that's the
whole story right
everything's got lots of facets
so i don't think the uh
the woke side of the world is looking so
good
now here's another interesting angle on
ukraine
jonathan turley who's always a great
read
uh has an article today he's talking
about
and i wasn't i'm not sure how
uh aware of this i was how many of you
were aware of this story
that for over two years
there's been an investigation
i guess it was a stated investigation
into hunter biden and his tax and
financial issues
specifically related to his foreign
dealings
now were you aware that there's a
two-year investigation ongoing about
hunter biden's
activities and his foreign dealings
which
presumably is either all ukraine or
mostly ukraine is what they're concerned
about
and that part of that is they seem to be
indicating
that hunter biden had a lot more cash or
that that seems to be where the evidence
is pointing
that he seemed to have a lot more cash
than his reported income would suggest
now
we don't
i'm going to use the same standard that
i would use for trump or anything else
right try to be fair about it
hunter biden
is not charged with anything
no court has found hunter biden guilty
of anything
i hate to say it but unfortunately
that's the standard
you know if you're gonna if you're gonna
be
like a decent
citizen
you have to accept the standard like the
standard is more important than the
person all right so as painful as it is
to say that he hasn't been convicted of
anything
that does matter you know unfortunately
unfortunately it matters
so uh and i wouldn't want to change that
but
at the same time they have been
investigating for two years and probably
not for nothing i mean there must be at
least some smoke doesn't mean they'll
ever find any fire but
here's a question which must be asked
do you think that
zelensky
the head of ukraine
do you think he has
information about the biden family that
we haven't heard yet
what are the odds i mean just think what
the odds would be
so if we know the hunter was mucking
around in ukrainian business
that much seems true
but we we have not seen anything
directly illegal about that only that it
seems deeply sketchy and
unquestionable and unethical
but not technically illegal as far as we
know
so
do you think that maybe
ukraine has something on the biden
family
at the same time that biden is trying to
manage this situation that's the most
important thing going on at the moment
now
let me do something that i hate to do
because of its ordinariness
but damn it sometimes you have to do the
ordinary
and i this is so uncreative that it
actually hurts me to do it but
sometimes you got to do it
imagine if this were don jr i hate it i
hate it i hate doing this i hate doing
this
because it's so uncreative like how many
times have we done that i mean don jr
does it all the time right
in his tweets he goes imagine if this
were me
and it's unfortunately it is exactly the
right thing
it's the right thought
can you even imagine
just just hold this thought for a moment
imagine a world in which trump were
president
and we had this problem with ukraine and
russia which maybe we wouldn't even have
but let's say we do
and imagine that the story had been don
jr doing business in ukraine and that
there were questions about it and
and
a current
ongoing investigation about it
can you even imagine
i mean seriously
my head is going to explode
imagining the difference between how the
media would be talking about that
and how they're just not talking about
hunter biden at all this doesn't even
exist
i fee somebody said impeachment here on
youtube in the comments
maybe
maybe
would you trust
and let's be honest would you trust
trump's judgment
if don jr might have some hidden secrets
you know that would come out if you
acted a different way
no even i wouldn't right like i've been
pretty supportive
of trump on a number of issues not in
everything but a lot of stuff
but
i wouldn't be comfortable with that
and by the way i think don jr is awesome
i like him
i like trump but if you just put those
two people i like
in that situation i wouldn't like that
oh no
no that i would back out immediately i'd
be like okay
i'm out these two people can't be
involved in the same situation this is
too much of a conflict of interest
we're not even talking about conflict of
interest are we
like but have you even heard the phrase
conflict of interest
can you imagine that you would never
hear that phrase
if this were don jr
and trump
right i mean it's just it's
mind-boggling the difference
all right
um
let's talk about some other stuff
in theory
we should be seeing some massive
cognitive dissonance
by the people who were most supportive
of biden
and least supportive of trump over the
past five years
now
because we're living in different
realities if there are any democrats
watching this right now
you may be saying to yourself i don't
know what you're talking about
scott i don't know what you're talking
about
and you don't and i can't fix that i'm
sorry
so to those of you who don't fall into
that category i guess i'm just talking
to you today
it's kind of obvious at this point
like super obvious
that on a whole range of issues not all
of them
not all of them but on a whole range of
issues trump was clearly the superior
president
at this point it's just obvious
you know there was certainly a point
where you could have said well
let's see what biden can do
right i think it was entirely possible
that biden could have come up with some
you know southern border solution that
was
you know kind and generous and yet good
enough for the united states maybe i
don't know
give them a chance
it didn't happen
you know maybe
maybe biden could come up with some
productive way to deal with russian
china i don't didn't happen
so
you know maybe biden could do something
better for the energy no it didn't
happen
so
at this point wouldn't you expect i'm
and just talking to my own audience here
i know you're you lean a particular way
but no you think
there should be some prominent democrats
just sort of going crazy now
because they can see what they did
you know they caused this problem
by insisting
on a brain dead president
well here's an example maybe
stephen king had this uh tweet
uh this is the i swear to god this
happened today no yesterday i guess
so it's fresh
uh he tweets uh so stephen king the
novelist he writes uh mr putin has made
a serious miscalculation he forgot he's
no longer dealing with trump
what
is he watching the same reality that i'm
watching
because i don't think that russia did
much when when trump was in charge
i i don't so to me it looks like
cognitive dissonance it was somebody
else called it out on uh
you know dale called it out on
twitter
um but raheem
had a uh
reply to it
he goes congrats you're the dumbest mfr
in america
that's funny it's only funny because
that was my exact thought
when i read it was like wow you might be
the dumbest m effer in america and then
i read
raheem's comment you congrats you're the
dumbest okay
um
now
this uh does suggest that there might be
a
medical problem that is under-recognized
and i would call it long-haul tds
long-haul tds yeah long-haul tds
the original tds would give you
some insanity and
anxiety
fear
you know like so so you don't want to
catch a bad case of tds
which by the way
can be transmitted
by personal contact
if you stand
uh and six feet isn't enough for tds for
uh for coving six feet is pretty good
for social distancing for but for tds
you've actually got to be outside of the
listening distance
so you want to be
well you want to keep your distance of
say a quarter mile from other people
to reduce the transmission of tds
because if you get closer to it than a
quarter mile that can still shout
you can hear them and that's a little
too close because
it gets transmitted by talking and ideas
so
there was a bad case of tds going
through the country for a few years but
now that's mostly subsided we've uh now
it's more endemic
situation we've learned to live with it
sort of a baseline problem like the flu
and
but we still have to be concerned about
long haul
are there any long-haul symptoms
and i think this cognitive dissonance
is sort of the myocarditis of tds
that it does seem
that having once had tds
you are more likely to have cognitive
dissonance even a year later
speaking of uh trump he uh he's getting
some attention by calling putin his
moves genius and very savvy
for the the way that he
the way that he reframed the separatist
regions
and then moved in to protect them
so trump said that that was really smart
and then
trump's critics said you fool
you putin lover you ask kissim putin
puppet you why are you saying good
things about putin you must be a monster
like him
so
is that exactly what was going on
i have two comments about this maybe
more
number one
there's one thing that trump never gets
credit for
his honesty about how he feels
now
i will grant you that when he's talking
about the outside world and the the
facts in the world he he can play
fast and loose with the facts
he is a salesperson he's unapologetic
about that he uses hype hyperbole to to
persuade he's unapologetic about that so
he is what he is
and you either like that or you don't
but i think we all understand it
but the thing that you miss about trump
is that when he tells you what his
opinion is
am i right
when he tells you what his opinion is
you always believe that
don't you
you never believe that he's telling you
something he doesn't personally believe
i don't think i don't think i've ever
once had that feeling
but when biden speaks
biden sounds like a politician doesn't
he
you don't really think he believes what
he what even says his opinion
the things he says he really cares about
i don't know that he does really
who knows
might be convenient to say he cares
about that stuff who knows
but
uh here's so when trump calls putin a
genius and savvy
it's basically
very similar to what i was thinking
in my private thoughts
i was thinking damn that's pretty smart
the way he's doing this
looks like it's you know pretty
successful at least in terms of
you know getting stronger control over
those separatist regions they look
pretty smart
now it's you know it's evil and
manipulative and
you know hitler-like
i'm not i'm not downplaying any of that
but it's smart
so that's the first thing that we miss
about trump is that he looks at
something that looks smart and he says
hey that looks smart
he's not approving of it
he's just saying you look smart that's
just his honest opinion
i don't know i miss it i miss it i miss
that part of it i honestly don't miss
the conflict
i i feel like i'm a little better off
without all of the
tds the tds was a
for me surviving the tds was almost as
hard as surviving the pandemic to be
honest
you know if if you're right in the
middle of it
i mean
there weren't enough vaccinations to get
me through tds
but you know i got through the pandemic
it was a pain in the ass but i got
through it
the tds i think is going to last forever
the tds will affect my career and my
reputation my wikipedia page
for the rest of time
all right
but let's talk about trump strategically
given that he
might be a future president
who knows why he says about putin really
does matter and even as an ex-president
it wouldn't matter
um
is as smart or not smart to call putin
a genius and to say that his moves are
savvy
go
but would you would you say that trump
is smart
or not smart to call putin a genius in
public
i think it's smart
because if you want to talk to somebody
productively later
you call them smart
i i hate to be the one who always has to
explain this to the general public
apparent apparently people watch this
live stream are all
you're you're all
educated about how this works
but the general public doesn't
understand
that there was only one person who
handled this right
and it was trump
he's the only one who handled it right
because ultimately we got to talk to
that guy
putin we got to talk to him
who is going to who is going to get a
better reception
the one who trump called smart
or the one who's just your evil blah
blah blah blah blah
i i feel that we're all human right
like even putin's a human being
do you think that putin is unaffected
by trump calling him smart
do you think he's unaffected by that
i think he's affected by it
i think it actually works
and that
if anybody were to talk to putin in the
future
about any of this
i would want it to be trump
i would want it to be trump
now i saw some people commenting about
how they were suspicious because trump
and putin had a private conversation
once with the interpreter i guess
but
since it was not recorded what that
conversation was
people are afraid that oh that's where
all the bad stuff happened that's maybe
that's where all the collusion happened
we don't know what happened you know
there's no way to know anything about
that
but here's what i would guess
just speculative
trump understands
that it's always personal
that's it
trump understands that it's always
personal
and i'm not sure why other people don't
don't kind of understand that as well as
he understands it everything's personal
here's another thing in the book uh
persuasion by childini
do you know what uh do you know what one
of the ways science has shown you can
befriend somebody and get them to trust
you as a friend
you tell them a secret
that's that's a well-known persuasion
trick
you tell them a secret
that's what trump did
now we don't know what they talked about
privately
but because we don't know
what is that called
a secret
right just we it might have been nothing
maybe maybe they didn't talk about
anything important at all but trump
created a situation where he and putin
are sharing a secret
ah
you didn't see that coming did you
that's about the best
technique
for persuasion you're ever going to
freaking see in your life
say what you will about trump you know
he's not free from criticism right
i'm not the one who's going to tell you
he's he's the
the god king and everything he does is
right
but
you got to give him credit for the
things that are just so right that
nobody's ever going to match it in my
opinion i don't think anybody will match
him
for personal persuasion now keep in mind
i don't know how many of you have ever
been in the room with him
but he does have that thing
that thing whatever that thing is that x
factor that
that charisma whatever it is
i'm sure putin has it too
but
you you put him in a room and he's going
to convince you of something
[Laughter]
he is good now by the way i think
biden's probably pretty good at that too
or he wouldn't be where he is
so i'm not saying he's bad at it but the
the style difference is striking and i
think trump is the one who played it who
would have played it completely
correctly
you want putin to think
you can work with him that he can trust
you what what is the biggest thing that
well let's talk about that
let's talk about uh
what russian people think
uh
about all this
so the russian people um
let's see i'm going to skip ahead to
that part
cnn was talking about a poll it's hard
to get information about the russian
public but i guess cnn ran some kind of
a
proprietary poll or personal poll or
something or
a special poll they have some word
forget what word that is it doesn't
matter
and here's what they found
uh one out of every two russians
actually 50 of them
uh said it would be
right um
more russians think it would be wrong
than right to use military force to
reunite russia and ukraine
so
so russians don't want to use military
right
military force to take over ukraine
but
the russian public does think that nato
is an offensive force
what
um
so russians believe nato is an offensive
force with plans to destroy russia
and the russians
but they do think
that the ukraine people and the russian
people are one people which is what
putin says
so putin has managed to convince much of
russia
that the ukrainian people and the
russian people are all one people
but the ukrainians don't believe that
not even close
so this is one of those cases where you
can see the power of propaganda
because
i need a more of a fact check on this
but i believe that the russian public
has access to the internet right
now there are some things that are you
know
regulated and some things that are
censored but generally speaking
the average russian can get the internet
right
and so if you imagine the average
ukrainian and the average russian both
have access to the outside world
you can see the power of propaganda
because the only thing
it would be one thing
like north korea to keep your people
completely walled off from other
information
then you can control their thoughts
pretty pretty well but if people have
access to the alternative opinions you
can see how powerful the propaganda is
because you know they've been turned
away from accuracy toward inaccuracy
so look at the difference between
ukrainian
and russian public opinion
about this one question
are the ukrainians and the russians one
people
only only
putin was the one who was pushing the
we're all one people thing
and he successfully did it
through propaganda you can you can see
how many or what percentage of the
public can be moved
by something as pure as propaganda it's
about half
it's about half
you can tell any story
if you tell it
often enough and you control enough of
the media that you know you can get a
monopoly on it now he doesn't even have
a monopoly that's my point if he had a
monopoly on information
well then you'd understand how that many
people could be convinced
but he did that
this is the scary part
he did that without a monopoly on
information
he did that just with persuasion
just with persuasion
so i would say that the percentage of
the public that you can move
with pure propaganda is around half
and you know the topic would vary so i'm
sure there are some topics you can get
80
sometimes 20. but i think you could
count on getting half of the public
which is enough to start a war
you know if you've got half of the
public on your side you can kind of go
to war
that's about enough you know 55 would be
better
so
um that answered my question i was just
asking the other day on live stream here
what do the what's the average russian
know about the whole situation
the other thing is that there are a
whole lot of people in russia
who don't think there's going to be
an invasion proper you know where
ukraine itself is completely taken over
there are a lot of people in russia who
don't think that's going to happen
and there are a lot of people in ukraine
like a big big chunk of ukraine doesn't
think there's going to be an invasion
but if you ask the people in the united
states wouldn't we say
90 of us
who were paying attention
what do you think it would be what do
you think it would be in the united
states
now it's different if you ask people who
are paying attention to the news versus
people we're not so i guess it's
nonsense to ask the general public
they're not even paying attention
yeah so i think maybe 10
well let me ask the question here
how many people on this live stream
do not think tr uh russia will in try to
take over all of ukraine
so tell me if you don't believe he's
going to try to take all of ukraine
i want to see i mean
okay a lot of people
now how many of you were influenced by
me
because i'm not too confident on my on
my opinion on this
was anybody influenced by me because
early on i said i don't think he's going
to do it and i'm sticking with my
prediction
just because the reasons for the
predictions haven't changed
although i have to admit it looks a lot
like he's going to attack
i wouldn't bet on me
let's put it this way
if i were you i wouldn't bet on me to be
right
but just to be consistent because my
reasons for the prediction never changed
i'm going to stick with it
now i'm not going to let my confidence
be
influenced by the fact that it looks in
every possible way it looks like exactly
like an invasion
because
bluffing would look exactly the same
if you wanted to do a really good job of
it bluffing would look the same what
would also look the same
is not having decided yet
that would look exactly the same
if you were if the only thing you were
doing
is you know pushing for negotiations to
get some concessions
and just making us think he's going to
attack any moment or even to find out
what her response is because maybe he
just is testing public opinion
maybe he's just testing the resolve of
nato
apparently there's a big opinion and
this is a
um
this is a weird one
a lot of people in russia think that the
united states is trying to trick russia
into attacking ukraine
is there anybody in the united states
you've heard besides me say that
that
i'm not going to say that we're actually
literally trying to trick them into
attacking ukraine
but i've actually tweeted
that it looks like it in other words
what we're observing looks exactly like
trying to trick them into
attacking ukraine now i don't know why
we would do that
except that maybe it'd be bad for russia
but
is it weird that the russian public
actually thinks that
a lot of them
they think we're trying to trick them
into attacking ukraine
how in the world is the russian public
having that opinion and i'm the only one
do a fact check have you heard anybody
else in america
say that it looks like we're trying to
trick them into attacking
because i didn't even believe my own
opinion i'm just saying that it if you
look at the facts it just looks like it
i mean it doesn't seem likely
but it looks like it
oh is cernovich and
posabi you've heard them
that would make sense
well i'm not talking about a wag the dog
situation the wag the dog i think
that's a more specific situation isn't
it
all right
some more interesting factoids here
let's get back to this i saw a good
tweet by eddie quan
he says if you think trusting the
science is smart wait until you learn
who's taking the scientists out for
lunch
that one just stops you in your tracks
doesn't it
if you think trusting the science is
smart wait until you learn who's taking
the scientists out for lunch
i i don't think i've ever seen anything
summarized
that well
actually i'll give you
one thing
once a friend of mine described the
comic strip marmaduke
uh which at that point had been like 50
years of marmaduke comics you summarize
the entire
life of the comic as a big dog is on
something you want
now that was a terribly unfair summary
but it's the only one i've seen that was
more succinct than if you think trusting
the science is smart wait till you learn
who's taking the scientists out for
lunch you could just be done
you you should have a college course
for a credit like full credit
you know it's a harvard class
and you go into the class and the first
day you sit down and they just show you
this tweet they go class
if you think trusting the science is
smart wait until you learn who's taking
the scientists out for lunch
class dismissed
anybody who can remember that tomorrow
gets an a in the class and there's no
coursework
because that's all you need to know
it's all there the entire
the
entire class work of how to understand
the media
how to work with it
how to understand science how to work
with it
human motivation
it's all there in one tweet
uh meanwhile uh speaking of the canadian
gulag
um
sure enough
canada is going hard after the people
involved in the protest their accounts
are being frozen
some of them can't get bail
their names are being posted the names
of people who donated to the truckers
are being posted on trees in some
neighborhoods so that you can know
who to be mad at in canada
uh this is the most chilling thing that
i've
seen in a long time and
i've seen some chilling things
so
i don't even know what to say about this
i mean it's so bad that like words words
start to escape but then you find out
that two-thirds of the canadian public
is totally on board with this sort of
stuff
did you know that
something like 65 percent of the
canadian public says you know they don't
like the convoy and they're pretty happy
that the government was tough on them
it's something like that right
two-thirds
so
if canada is getting what it wants by a
two-thirds majority i'm not sure how
concerned i should be
here's another scary thing homeland
security is looking into battling online
and misinformation
and has considered that misinformation
could rise to the level of terrorism
i mean in effect
now do you believe that
do you believe that misinformation
be it intentional or not
i guess the intention kind of would be
the worst kind that homeland security
would care about
but that the misinformation could be
like as bad as terrorism
i would say yes
i would say yes
you can see the effect in russia versus
ukraine
the public opinion and misinformation
could actually cause a land war in
europe
this could be a misinformation war
so
on one hand i can totally see how
homeland security thinks information
and the control of it
is necessary to avoid terrorism
on the other hand
there goes your free speech
am i right
how in the world can you regulate
speech
as a
tool of terror
and expect anybody's going to give you a
fair opinion that doesn't have you know
somebody's self-interest in the
government involved
they can't co-exist you just can't have
i don't think
correct me if i'm wrong but i don't
think you can have government control
over information
without giving away
free speech
they're just too connected
all right
i thought biden was kind of clever and
in saying that this was a start of an
invasion instead of an invasion
you remember all yesterday there was the
argument is an invasion or is it not an
invasion
and then biden comes out and goes it's
the start of an invasion and i thought
oh that's good
that's actually pretty good
because that does
that does actually
i know it feels like he high grounded it
like once he says that you go ah
oh yeah that's true
right
now
because if you thought it was an
invasion he said it's the start of an
invasion
and if you thought it wasn't quite an
invasion you could say well yeah it's
just the start
i thought it was one of the most clever
uh political
twists
you know linguistic tricks i've seen in
a long time no i don't think he wrote it
i mean i think somebody came up with it
but if you know if trump had said this
i'd think it was clever
so i'll give biden this
so we've got all this
these sanctions that are going on so far
can anybody tell me that they know if
these sanctions are powerful or not
is it my imagination or every time we
hear about sanctions
isn't there always more to the story
like oh our sanction is we're going to
behead
every
baby that's born in russia
and then you read but the context is
uh that no babies are actually born in
russia because it's called the
federation of russian yeah
there's always some technicality
where you think oh we got them now
oh
look at those sanctions
we've got those sanctions now
and then you turn out that the
nordstream pipeline is just a delay of
certification
what
he's not going to be afraid of a delay
of certification
because you know it will stop the delay
on the certification
running out of fuel in the winter
yeah that that will pretty much speed up
your certifications you're going to get
real flexible with russia as soon as it
gets real cold
and you're running out of energy
so that's like a nothing
every time you hear that there's
something
somebody in five minutes later is going
to say yeah but you know it'd be pretty
easy to get around that one
so i can't even tell as an observer if
any of this makes any difference
so two banks were targeted
so uh
uh sanctions on russian sovereign debt i
don't even know what that means
honestly i don't even know what that
means i mean obviously they'll have
trouble refinancing and getting extra
debt
but i don't know the larger
ramifications does that mean they just
get help somewhere else and it doesn't
matter
you know was china going to buy up all
their debt anyway
does it matter i don't know do you
um
a ban on purchases of russian bonds i
don't know was that a big deal
nobody else is going to buy them
how do i judge that how do they judge it
sanctions on russian elites and their
families oh now we got them
we got some sanctions on russian elites
of what kind
like what what is it that they can't do
if you've got 10 billion dollars
tell me what you can't do
am i right
i mean travel
is there travel restrictions
are they not going to let these
oligarchs be involved in businesses that
we do business with is it even practical
to stop would we be shooting ourselves
in the foot harder than we're shooting
them if we did
why is it that we have no idea if these
sanctions even matter
we have no idea
and the news doesn't know because i
don't think there's anybody smart enough
to analyze it and give you the story
um
there's no region in ukraine and no age
group that where a majority of
respondents say the russians and
ukraines are one people that's also from
the cnn stuff
all right here's another interesting
twist on cnn chris eliza who's one of
their main opinion people
he does a whole piece about how mitt
romney was right
when when romney said as he was running
against obama he said that russia was
our biggest
foe
and of course obama just slaughtered him
in the debate by saying that china was
obviously the biggest foe and russia's
are you know the that romney's stuck in
the past well now seliza is basically
saying that
romney was right that russia is the
bigger problem
and
um
when do you see cnn agreeing with a
republican
doesn't that raise a little flag for you
is it a coincidence the cnn
is
telling us that we should focus on
russia as the problem and not china
that doesn't feel like
an independent opinion to me
now
i can't read anybody's mind and i'm not
going to allege anything i'm just saying
that when i read it it doesn't look like
somebody independently said let me think
about this
with no influence from my corporate
masters let me just say that maybe maybe
russia is the problem and not china
when when cnn has i believe
more to lose
by making china unhappy
than russia because cnn has been
anti-russia russia is connected to trump
even though it's not
forever
so this feels just more like cnn's
wave of propaganda against russia
because you tie them to the republican
sorts of trump
so
how many of you believe that uh
this new study in nature so it's been
out a few weeks i guess
and i think i talked about it that the
risk of myocarditis is five times
greater if you had
coveted
than if you didn't
and that it's it was five times higher
than even a
the risk of myocarditis from the
vaccinations do you believe that data
we don't believe any data these days but
it looks like it was a
you know a credible publication for a
study
but of course you should be skeptical
about everything
now what would happen if this data
stands do you think that there'll be
future data that will
overturn this
idea
the idea being that
long covet is bad for your
cardiovascular system
uh
and that
you'd be better off getting the
vaccination according to this not
according to me
because i'm not the authority here
but according to this data
do you think that that someday will
change
do you think that someday the
the consensus of science will will flip
do you think in 20 years we'll look back
and say oh the vaccinations
were the real health problem not the
actual coven long covered
i don't know i mean i think this is one
of those anything could happen
situations i wouldn't be surprised
either way i wouldn't be surprised
either way
um
but
suppose it's true
that there is a 60 chance
of of
greater cardio problems
doesn't that mean that we could have a
lot of extra covides
as much as a year or more after the
actual covent
and therefore they would not be
attributed to covet
but there might be more of those deaths
than we've even seen so far
am i doing the math right
let's say a million people died
am i doing the math right help me out
here with just top of the envelope if a
million americans died of coven
uh but compare that to how many people
got covered
but then just recovered
now if the group that got coveted and
recovered
would have a baseline rate of
i don't know
10 of them
maybe getting
dying of cardiovascular problems every
year
what's the number 5
maybe five percent of them were going to
die anyway
um
of cardiovascular but
now let's say that the covalent let's
say let's say this study was accurate
if the if the covalent gave them a 50 or
60 percent higher chance of dying
because given that cardiovascular is i
believe the number one cause of death in
the united states
fact-check me i believe it's number one
so the number one cause of death if that
got ramped up by another 50 percent
and it doesn't kick in for a year or
more
shouldn't we see over time
maybe it takes five years
but should we see over time more people
dying in the future
from the pandemic
than than from the past
am i
are my numbers way off
what do you think now that's that's a
big assumption right the big assumption
is that now also you would have to add
to that
any side effects from the vaccination
itself
because if you're looking at
pandemic deaths
you do have to count everybody who died
because of the shutdowns
everybody who died because the cove
itself everybody died who because
because the vaccination was you know
unfortunately they were one of the ones
who had a bad
effect you'd have to add all of that
together and so i i have a feeling that
the covenant death is about double
what is reported so far and that we
might lose another million people
sooner than they had to go
you know you could argue that all the
changes it was a little sooner but
that's true for all of us
all right
um
is there anything else happening
well uh jack bosovics tweeted that 60 65
percent of democrats
i feel like everything's 65 today that's
weird
65 percent of democrats approve of
trudeau's
down on freedom protesters and freezing
of bank accounts
um
so that that's obviously democrats
meaning americans
so
i i wasn't really completely aware of
this until at least halfway through the
convoy situation
i didn't realize that
so many democrats
were completely in favor of the
government's actions there
now i guess i would have thought that if
i'd seen how many people wear masks in
california
after it's not required
it is really really amazing
to see how many people are wearing masks
without it being required now i'm not
going to name names but i actually
witnessed
yesterday
somebody put on a mask somebody i know
put on the mask in a public place
and i said oh masks are not required
and said individual who shall remain
nameless said i know
i prefer it
not for health reasons
not for health reasons
felt more comfortable
that's a real thing
that is a real thing
now
you know people have different reasons
but everything from uh people think the
and by the way there's a there's a name
for uh
have you have you ever heard of the name
mask fishing
i heard this recently have you heard of
mask fishing
so catfishing is when you pretend you're
a different person than the picture
mask fiction
mask
mask fishing is when you're attractive
but only only in this little zone here
and the rest of it is just a is a hot
mess
so apparently there are a number of
people who are pretty happy wearing
masks it improves their overall
attractiveness
and that's not a joke
it's not a joke that it improved to some
people's overall attractiveness and they
wanted to keep it and and other people i
think were
shy
and i have to admit that i felt that too
when i walked into a store without a
mask after having you know been so
acclimated to wearing masks i actually
felt a little naked and exposed
has anybody had that yet
now it wasn't enough to make me put a
mask on but
but i felt a little naked and a little
bit exposed
i didn't have any feelings about virus
it was just a social feeling
and i can absolutely
you know and i'm
i'm uh you know not embarrassed by
pretty much anything
so
it wasn't really embarrassment or
anything like that
anyway that is everything i think i
wanted to say today and you have been
witness to the best livestream that's
ever happened in the history of the
world
with some of the most fun people
obviously the sexiest smartest
most flexible and open-minded
human beings of all time give yourself a
pat in the back
okay that's enough that's enough
cut it out
all right and tomorrow
we'll do it again
every single day
