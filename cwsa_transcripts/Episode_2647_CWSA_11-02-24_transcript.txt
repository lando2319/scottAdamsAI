what a show we have ready for you today
when I say we I mean mostly
me let's get your comments up
here there we
[Music]
go good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take your experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
when they're tiny shiny human brains all
you need is guer M Glass a tank of chel
aen juger flask vessel of fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dope mean of the day the thing that
makes everything better is called the
simultaneous up and it's going to happen
now
H I'll bet you all voted for that am I
right all
right first we have some news and we're
going to get to all the fun political
stuff but did you know that according to
IFL science Iceland could be the first
nation to get solar power from space by
2030 they're going to put a big ass
satellite up there with the solar cells
and they're going to collect all that
electricity up there because there are
no clouds there are no clouds there at
all whereas you could not put them on
the ground in Iceland because of all the
clouds but the satellite will gather up
all the electricity and it will send it
down to Iceland with some kind of uh
some kind of uh radio
waves and those radio waves are a
specific kind that can be turned into
electricity so how about that now if
they do it wrong of course the you know
the risk is that Iceland will melt and
fall into the sea but until 2030 Iceland
would be a good place to visit except
for the volcanoes so sometime between
the
volcanoes and the satellite that melts
the entire country good time to
visit all right I'm going to ask you you
some questions that science has already
answered and I want to see if you're as
smart as
science could these people have skipped
the sciencing and just asked you here's
the question do you believe that being
kind can make you look more
attractive do you think that kind people
appear more attractive
go and the answer is
yes you knew that without even doing a
study um I knew that without a
study um because it's really my
secret I know you don't believe this I I
swear this is true all right I'm going
to tell you something that you're going
to resist but uh I promise you I promise
you this is the truth it's not going to
seem true but it's true in
reality I'm not a very attractive man no
I know I know I know seriously seriously
I'm not but because of my
kindness I appear to you as
beautiful but I promise you I'm not
attractive it's it's an illusion that I
put together with my kindness using
science all right here's the next
question from y University they did a
little study they wanted to find out if
political professionals are any better
than the general public in predicting
which kind of messages will persuade
people so do you think that there is
such a thing as political professionals
who can tell you what a good message is
versus a bad message yes or no can can
the political professionals do better
than the okay it's kind of a trick
because you know I wouldn't even ask the
question if the political professionals
did
better would we even be talking about it
if the political professionals did
better than amateurs do you think it do
you think that would be a top of story
oh it looks like people who practice
things do
better glad I told you
no it turns out that the political Pros
according to the yell University didn't
know better than ordinary people when it
came to figuring out what messages were
the most persuasive but is there
something they should have studied
instead huh they did political Pros and
they did ordinary
voters and they found that neither of
them are any good at all and knowing
what a good persuasive message would be
huh if I were designing that study maybe
I would have added a third
group
hypnotists do you think hypnotists would
not do any better than political
professionals or lay people in figuring
out what is
persuasive they didn't do the stuff but
they don't really need to yes the p a
good hypnotist on average wouldn't be
every hypnotist but hypnotist would in
fact be better at knowing what would
persuade but political professionals I
do observe don't seem to know their own
jobs that one of the reasons that I so
arrogantly inserted myself into the
political conversation in America is
that I looked at what the professionals
were saying and I thought well I could
do better than
[Laughter]
that that's the same reason I became a
cartoonist when I was very young I would
open the comics I I'd read all the
comics and I think to myself is in my
imagination or these Comics
suck you know they're well drawn but
they're not really funny and I thought
to myself I wonder if I could do better
than that on the first
try and then Dilbert was born and then
one day I Saidi think I should talk
about politics next thing you know here
I am
anyway all right here's your next
one
um there was a according to the hill now
I only read the headline on this one so
I didn't I didn't read too much of the
details but I got the general idea so
OIC the weight loss
drug uh seems to also have a correlation
with helping people with have knee pain
from
osteoarthritis so it turns out that
unexpectedly that people who were on a
OIC um not only did they lose weight we
knew about that but they also had much
less knee pain so now they're thinking
that the OIC is good for your knee
pain does that sound right to
you all right all right let me ask you
this if nobody had ever done a study on
this this and I were to ask you hey I
just I want to save some money on a
study do you think if I gave people a
weight loss drug that absolutely totally
works and they lost a bunch of weight
yes or no their knee pain would be
reduced and I'd be like H I don't know I
don't know they how much how much weight
do they lose oh a lot a lot I mean
people are losing 80 lbs you know some
people losing 60 100 lbs I'm like would
that would that make your knee pain less
I'm going to go out the limb and say yes
I'm going to say yes and the answer is
yes yes it does it
does so that's your science working for
you according to S poost people who have
higher
narcissism are linked to uh better
Mental
Health so the more narcissistic you are
uh the less depressed and anxious you
are and the less stress you
have apparently if you're a narcissist
you transfer all of your depression
anxiety and stress to the people you're
dealing with and it offloads it from you
now did we need to do a study on
this did you need to do a study to find
that the narcissists seem happier than
you no no
the the narcissists always look happier
than you have you ever seen Trump look
unhappy the got shot in the head
and he still looks
happy of course narcissists seem happier
than you you didn't have to study
that all right here's the funniest story
of the day uh there was a
story uh that some whistleblower is
saying that the United States has a UAP
uh a recovery program that the
government has a program where where
they've actually recovered
UFOs and the the entire news cycle for
that was 10
minutes so the funny part is not the
story the funny part is that there could
be a news story that that we would all
see that says our government is
recovering Advanced alien
spacecrafts and we just look at it and
go
ah the trouble is it came too close to
the election it's too on the nose you
you got to do that six months
before the election and then we might
believe it you put it right on the week
of the election there's not a single
person in the country that thought it
was
real as soon as you ju supposed it too
close to the election everybody looked
at it and
said N I don't think
so so that was
funny all right here's another one
Stanford University did a
study uh and partisanship versus the
truth so they wanted to see if
uh if the public at large would put
partisanship over truth when consuming
news in other words would being on a
team make you accept a partisan truth in
other words something that isn't true
over something that was
true what do you think do you think when
people join a
team that they value what the team says
is true over what seems obviously
true do you think they needed to do a
study do you think they could have just
asked me since I say about once a week
for the last 10 years that if you're on
a team you're going to vote for them
whether your team is bashit crazy or not
no you didn't have to study this people
I could have I could have answered this
quite
definitively but here's the funniest
part you see if you picked up on this
this is a study in which the researchers
were trying to give people true facts
presumably about you know the news and
life in general true facts and then they
were going to give them some not true
facts and then they were going to see if
they could sort them out and who could
sort them out better do you see anything
wrong with that
you see any problem with the study
design it it means the researchers
believe they could tell what was
true that's not a
thing there's no object we don't have an
objective source of
truth I don't know that you could study
that because if it if it was anything
from The Real World there was no
objective truth so they wouldn't know
who was right or who wasn't wrong that
would have no way to know because they
wouldn't know if they were being
affected the same way everybody else is
being
affected uh but if they didn't use the
real world for their test and I don't
know what they did but if they used an
artificial statement and some artificial
false thing I think people would have
detected that it was artificial so you
wouldn't get an actual
test
so I think they should have just talked
to me about that save some
time all right I would like to give you
a summary of all the stories that I'm
hearing about the
election uh this will be a jumble of
just words and things that are coming
out uh something about to drop box and
the the uh the post office should have
mailed the thing but they didn't think
the thing and then the then the court
they ruled on the thing they overruled
the thing that was the thing but then
they ruled it back back but they might
change that cuz that might be challenge
but that might only be 50 ballots but it
could be as many as 500 there's some
people that saw some things that
happened to with boxes but maybe they
didn't see it there are some people who
say that the court should be involved in
the thing the the voting the people that
the the address is not matching the
voter
roles okay I have no idea what's going
on with the election all I know is that
the number of reported
irregularities is very high
and they're all over the place and you
know on first hearing they sound
credible right so there's one you know
one says somebody dropped a bunch of
ballots in a box sounds credible but it
could very easily be it was just their
relatives and everything's fine so you
know that you can have a lot of claims
and remember my
rule the rule is this 99% % of the
claims won't be true they will be false
guaranteed 99% of all the election fraud
claims won't be
true what we don't know about is the
1% and I'm not saying that the 1% will
be true I'm saying that you could be
pretty sure that 99% won't be it's just
that if there were any true ones in the
mix you wouldn't know which is a problem
so if the number of potential and this
is just um hypothetical talk
speculative if there were real
irregularities they would be so buried
with the fake ones that no legal system
could sort it out before a president is
picked so we might be um we might be
drowning in our own good luck meaning
that we've got these thousands of
election observers a lot of them are
attorneys they're going to find stuff or
at least they're going to see things
that they don't understand and then
they're going to say hm I don't
understand what I just saw like why did
that box get moved over there and why
who unlocked it so they're going to
write it up and maybe it was a nothing
and that's going to take as much time as
something that might have been real so I
think the number of observers
guarantees
guarantees that the number of CLS will
far exceed the system's ability to
process them before we have to have a
president January 6 so this is why I
reiterate my prediction we will not have
chosen the president by January 6
because the legal system will be all
gummed up and there will be protests on
the streets and people will be
threatening every possible thing you can
threaten so and I think people will be
going to jail by then I think people
will get an A Line people will do some
violent things that I do not recommend
don't do anything violent um but here's
the
thing we'll figure it
out I I I think we're very close to what
I would call the very best best best
case scenario but it doesn't have to go
that way it could it could go off the
rails so one of the possibilities is
America just goes off the rails if I had
to put a percentage on it I'd say 20%
10% maybe so there's there's a real risk
I mean we don't America doesn't run into
too many you know 10% risks of going off
the rails it's pretty unusual so there's
a real
risk but
90% is that we're going to find massive
election
fraud Trump will be proved right that in
2024 there was enough fraud that any
smart person will say oh damn it must
have been there in
2020 I think that's where we're heading
very fast I think that so many Watchers
will find so many things that it will
look like 2020 must have been rigged
because you couldn't have this many
irregularities in 2024 unless they were
also there before we just weren't
looking for them so best case
scenario best case scenario Trump wins
after a protracted fight and he proves
that he was right about the election
being rigged in the first place that's
the highest win you can't win harder
than that if you're going to make a like
a list of what's the hardest you could
win well it would be that it would be
that so uh let's see yeah we've got
misleader voting misleading voter
information sent out all kinds of claims
rasmuson uh polling the rasmon reports
says they have done their final Poll for
the election so there will be no updates
from rasmason this is their final poll
now why is that important it's important
because rasmon has been pretty close in
the last several elections so they're
top five
typically
um and here's what they're poll is and
this is for the whole country so this
would be the the the popular
vote you ready for
this Trump up three
nationally do you know what that
means if Trump is up three
nationally that won't just be a
landslide it could be the biggest one
we've ever seen
maybe but there's also a possibility
that polling is wonky this year and I
think I think rasmason would admit that
as well that uh the pollsters are
very they're very nervous this time
because they think the people are lying
to them and and they probably are and
it's just difficult to get people to
answer but
uh if I were a
Democrat and I were on the haris team do
you know what is the last thing I would
want to hear dead
last rasm rasmason says Trump is up
three
nationally few days before the
election there's nothing worse than
that you can feel the dagger halfway in
like it's not all the way in but it's
like you know there's like three more
three more pushes
but but rasmuson up three two days
before election up three nationally now
remember Trump could win a landslide
being behind
nationally if he's ahead
nationally all right um in Arizona there
is some uh question about the veracity
of the polling and uh I won't get into
the details but there's some thought
that the polls have been just
outrageously um
rigged uh and that would be important
not just for Trump but for especially
Cary
Lake because polls had been showing that
Trump might win but that Cary Lake was
uh kind of far behinder Challenger whose
name is uh Ruben g g Gago
um
however when things get close to the
actual election do you remember what
happens that's when the fake polls stop
faking because you could always say well
a month ago that's what it was but since
we didn't vote we can't prove we were
right or wrong but but we say a month
ago we were right too once you have the
vote you no longer can argue that your
poll was right if it doesn't matter the
vote so at that last minute the polls
are going to look the most accurate
they'll ever look and here's what's new
the latest data orbital poll put uh K
Lake taking a slim lead over Ruben gyo
and president Trump overtaking Harris
with a massive 7.8%
lead and
uh yeah
yeah if Trump is up
7.8 and car lake has a narrow lead in
the
polling it's looking like a good day for
car Lake now of course we don't know
which poles are more reliable than other
poles and you know I I haven't heard of
some of these but what you would expect
is if the polls used to be rigged and
there's certainly some good there
there's good uh let's say the reporting
on that suggests that they
are uh you would see that this would be
the most rura poll today because it's
the closest to the election and then
suddenly for the first time Carri Lakes
ahead maybe she was always
had maybe the polls were just trying to
push the fundraising in One Direction so
we don't know what's going to happen
still too close to call but uh
might be a good day coming
up all right if you'd like to know how
powerful is brainwashing here's one of
those natural experiments there's an
experiment in the wild meaning that it
wasn't an experiment on brainwashing but
it accident shows you how powerful it is
so according to axios
Vibes they did a little poll about uh
different ages of Voters and whether
people at different ages trust or don't
trust voting machines they call it
ballot machines uh more than human
counting so it turns out that uh Boomers
uh they trust voting machines 68% of
them would trust a machine over a human
counting right so if you're if you're
elderly you're you're thinking those
voting machines are better than
people if you're a millennial and you
were born and raised and steeped in
techn
techology uh only half of them half of
Millennials believe that the ballot
machines are better than human
counting now when i s told you this was
a natural test about brainwashing here's
what I mean there are very few
situations where you can know for sure
what's right because we're not that
smart right when I look at a poll of
what do you think is right I usually
have a strong opinion but I'm also at
the same time think but it's an opinion
like it could be wrong but when it comes
to voting
machines and whether or not you should
trust them more than human
counting that's
actually something that uh I don't think
is an
opinion because if it's human counting
you have more than one person watching
so the odds of that going wrong
especially since you could recount is
pretty low
because the person watching can just
find the errors or demand a recount but
if you have a machine things go into the
black box and you and I don't know what
kind of controls they have and if they
said they have great controls you
wouldn't know if that's true if they
said nobody could ever hack us you'd say
really it's the only machine in the
world that can't be hacked and they'd
say nope we're not even connected to the
internet and then you say but do human
beings have access to them well yes they
do well then what's the difference if
they're attached to the internet because
a human can just stick a card in there
and reprogram them right well but nobody
has said that or nobody's been caught to
which I
say but you don't know if anybody's done
anything it's just not knowable we have
a system that's
designed to make sure you don't
know
now that tells you how power powerful
bre washing is that even half of
Millennials who who are more educated
about the vulnerabilities of Technology
even half of them think that they would
trust the machine more than the
person now if half of them had said oh I
think the machines will be faster well
that would be an opinion that maybe is
wrong they would just be less
experienced about what really
happens but if you if you say you trust
the machine more than a
person more than two people because it
would be two people looking
at I don't know that feels more like
brainwashing because I don't know how
your common sense could ever get to you
to the point of trusting the machine
over a
person I remember when ATMs were first
rolled
out at at Banks I was working at Crocker
Bank in San Francisco we were one of the
first banks in the country to have ATMs
so we also have to deal with the
psychology of the uh customer do you
know what the biggest problem with ATMs
was it wasn't the technology it wasn't
the cost it wasn't the implementation it
was older
people uh wouldn't trust the Machine
versus a teller because I think if you
know if a teller makes a mistake it's
sort of there two of us watching and you
know it's easier to catch but if the
machine gives you less money than it
says what are you going to do what are
you going to do
if the machine says there I just gave
you your $100 but it only gave you
20 the all the old people were like oh
hell what are we going to do now the the
answer turned out to be ridiculously
simple the bank just backs the customer
most of the time and they've got video
so all the machines have video so you
can see for sure but for the small stuff
if you went in and said I asked for $40
but your ATM only gave me 20 and they
wanted to make a big deal about it maybe
for some reason the video didn't work uh
the bank would just give you $20 you
know the extra $20 because they're not
going to fight for $20 so it turns out
that this seemed like a big
problem was not really any problem
nobody's really had any major ATM
problems so you can see that the Trust
In machines is not
automatic and if people are if
two-thirds of boomers are trusting these
ballot machines it suggests that that's
a brainwashing operation and not so much
because they thought about it or or that
it matches their experience in
life well the top 1% of Americans
according to unusual whales uh on X top
1% of Americans um households hold 30%
of us wealth a massive 44.6 trillion now
on one hand that sounds pretty bad that
1% own that much wealth
on the other hand whenever the news
talks about economics they get so much
wrong that I feel like I have to add at
least this
clarification
billionaires technically have billions
of dollars but it's not in the
mattress when when I see stories like
this I think I think well they're
keeping it in a mattress right so nobody
else can get to it or or or have any
benefits from it no it's
employed all their money is employed
it's invested it's either in a business
that's operating it's in stocks that are
boosted by their ownership it's it's in
Banks where they the bank can then lend
it out if you didn't have people who had
more money than they needed to spend you
wouldn't have much of a country you need
to have some people and ideally lots of
them who have so much more money than
they have a need to spend it that it
gets employed in places that it wouldn't
normally go do you know why the United
States has such a good
entrepreneurial um culture and other
places
don't here's
why if you told me Scott you're you're
not you're doing better than just
getting by you are saving a little extra
money so you're saving 10% of your
paycheck every year and you're doing
good you saved up $100,000 in your uh
your retirement account and it's it's
growing 10% a
year that's not enough for me to invest
in a startup are you kidding I'd be like
oh my God I'm going to need every penny
I'm not going to take a chance on a
startup but if you give me a hundred
billion
dollar and say Here's a100 billion do
I'm GNA say what the hell am I going to
do with100 billion
do if I Tred to consume all day long the
most expensive things a person can
consume I wouldn't even get close to
that so what does the world need okay to
go to
Mars so that's how you get Mars you
don't get Mars unless you also have 1%
of the top Americans own 30% of the
wealth you don't get Mars and there's
probably a whole bunch of things you
don't get because you're not going to
get the the big crazy Investments that
sometimes work out you need somebody to
be crazy
dumb like how do you think Uber got
started it was just a whole bunch of
rich people who could put in massive
amounts of money because they had it and
then that one works out they don't all
work
out so I think that when we look at how
much the rich people
own as someone with an economics
background I say ah that kills me I know
it's unfair and I do understand the
argument it's just that the whole system
depends on our smartest people having
the most
money you don't want to take the money
away from the best
investors and and and give it to the
people who are buying cigarettes and
wine now if they need health care and
food well then yes we got to do
something about that but you don't want
you don't want the smartest people not
to be making the decisions you want you
want Elon Musk to have a trillion
dollars well obvious example do you
think the world would be better off if
Elon Musk had his 250 billion whatever
he's worth or do you think the world
would be better off if he had half a
trillion well what is he doing with his
money has he spent it on his big mansion
I don't believe he has
one has he spent it with a you know gold
encrusted candy or something I don't
know whatever rich people do no he he's
building new businesses he's putting
satellites up he's going into space he
would do more of that so we have to keep
it in
perspective here is potentially some
good news in the Daniel peny case uh and
I can't believe that the public is just
finding this out so his trial started
and now we have learned that uh Neely
the person who died tragically um he was
the erratic guy who was threatening
people on the subway and Daniel peny put
him in a choke hold and he died soon
after but here's what we didn't know
when police alive arrived he was still
alive and he was already in recovery
hold in other words the way he was being
restrained when police arrived was not
in a way that would be dangerous it was
he had already released the more
dangerous hold for a less you know more
of a recovery hold they call it and uh
he was breathing and his heart was
beating when police came there police
instead of giving him mouth to mouth
because quote he seemed like a drug
user so they gave him Naran instead so
Naran as if it were an opioid overdose
probably it wasn't because the narana
would have worked
otherwise but we will need to find out
more about what he actually died from
but if you tell me that the police
arrived when he was alive and they
administered what appears to be the
wrong kind of first
aid is Daniel Penny going to be liable
for
anything this feels like one of those
situations where the criminal case will
release him and the family will sue him
and ruin his life because because they
could probably get a majority which is
all you need for a lawsuit to say oh
yeah yeah the majority thinks you
probably
did something wrong so you need to give
us a billion dollars that you'll never
have so you'll never be able to have a
real job or make money or take care of a
family probably but the criminal trial I
don't know that you could get 12
people of which certainly there will be
a few people who want more Daniel
pennies and not fewer of them I mean
could you really get 12 people 12
Americans and not one of them wants more
Daniel pennies you know what I mean
because I want more Daniel pennies if
you could give me a 100 Daniel pennies I
will take
everyone everyone even if they do this
even if every one of them you know was
involved in this because it doesn't look
like he killed them it looks like what
he did was it the the very minimum that
seems to have been proved is that uh
Daniel Penny knew where the line was and
didn't cross it
that's what it looks like it looks like
he knew where the line was what would be
a deadly force and he did not use
it now and and then the fact that he had
already um loosened to a recovery mode
before the police got there and there
were other people around you know
helping to it certainly shows that his
intention was protection both protection
of the people in the car protection of
himself obviously but also protecting
the per cuz he put him in a protective
mode once the danger had
passed if this guy
gets gets
uh put in jail for
this I'm going to have a real problem
with
it all right because it looks like
racism let's be honest it just looks
like racism against white guys you know
and uh I'd like to see Daniel Penny get
out I'd like to see President Trump get
in
and I'd like to see a lot of things go
our way this
week meanwhile Jamie Rasin was on Bill
marah show Eric abinante watched the
show so I didn't have to and he reports
some of the things that happened saw
some
clips and uh Bill Mar asked asking if he
was worried that Trump would go after
his
enemies and Mara said to Rasin you
yourself might be in trouble you were
the lead impeachment manager how big an
a-hole do you have to be where they go
after you after you left the job of
being that person I guess um and here's
my answer to that uh you may have heard
this
before no one is above the
law why are they so
afraid why are they so afraid no one's
Above the Law and no one is suggesting
that anything outside the law happen are
there are there some Republicans who are
suggesting let's do something outside
the legal process I've never heard that
I've never heard a single person suggest
we do something outside the legal
process so why would anybody would be
worried it seems to Signal
some some indication of
guilt now I can't read
mins but I know if you said to me Scott
are you worried about being arrested for
murdering uh that guy that died in the
hands of Daniel Penny I'd say well no I
wasn't even there how could a How could
a legal process put me in jail when I
literally wasn't even in the state and
it's easy to prove so no not worried but
Jamie Rasin seems to be
worried what's he worried
about if he didn't break any crimes I
don't know any Republican that would be
in favor of the legal process being used
against them I mean there must be I it's
a big world so there's somebody in favor
of everything but I don't know anybody I
wouldn't be in favor of it yeah if I see
the legal system being pushed by
Republicans to do some against
Democrats I'm going to be really loud
about it because it's not just about
Trump it's just we can't have a country
if we're law faring our leaders just
can't do it so no Republicans I think
the good ones are not anywhere near the
page where they would want to punish
anybody just for
Revenge but if the law was
broken no one's above the
law but here's the best
part um Bill Mah asked Rasin if he would
accept uh he would accept the
results of the
election what have I been
saying I've been saying can somebody
please please do your job as a
reporter and ask a ranking
Democrat will you accept the results of
the election if it doesn't look
legitimate to you because that's what
Trump did he didn't accept it when it
didn't look legitimate to him so the
question has to be Jamie Rasin will you
accept the result if it doesn't look
legitimate to you do you know what he
said
no he said no he said if it looked like
there was some you I'm I'm paraphrasing
but if he said it looks like there's
some
Shenanigans and it's you know sort of
clear that there are some Shenanigans
then no of course I would not accept
that there it
is that that's it we're done that's the
whole election January 6 was the only
thing they
were hanging their hat on if by the end
of Monday the at least the Republican
press hasn't made this the biggest
story then they're pretty incompetent
this is the biggest
story This is Everything Trump wants
Trump just won January 6 he want it in a
knockout it's a knockout Jamie Rasin
just said he'd do the same thing Trump
would do you said it on live TV you said
it clearly you said it unambiguously
there was no gray area he said it if it
doesn't look real he's not going to
accept it exactly what Trump
did now you might say but but but who
gets to decide whether it looks real
enough and the answer is we all do we
all get to decide if it looks real
enough Jamie Raskin is going to make his
decision and he gets to do that Trump
made his decision he gets to do that I
made my decision I get to do that
there's nobody above us for our opinions
right nobody above us so
if if the public doesn't like the result
apparently Jamie Rasin and Trump are on
the same page that you shouldn't accept
it this is the biggest news of the year
because it came from Jamie Rasin and it
just completely it completely um freees
Trump from all these allegations now
only if the Republican leaning press
knows how to handle it if they let this
go and like the day goes by and and
tomorrow goes by and nobody mentioned
that the whole January 6 narrative
completely fell apart
completely well then I'd be pretty
disappointed but this should be the end
of it this should be a resounding Trump
Victory after this we'll
see
um and uh this this is also something
uh that I was wondering about so the
Democrats were doing that saving
democracy message and one of the guests
on Bill Mah also was doing well you know
we should worry about the important
things like saving democracy to which I
thought at what
point was an average person worried
about losing democracy they're worried
about paying for gas and college and
stuff like that but that was never real
the whole saving democracy thing and
once you hear Jamie Raskin say that he
would not accept an election that looks
sketchy to
him we can throw away this whole
democracy is at risk too that's also
gone that's gone
because if you get to decide what
democracy looks like and it's just your
opinion well democracy is already gone
so I don't think it ever made sense that
democracy was at risk and I I don't
think the public bought that but some
percentage 25% probably B it um
compliments to Bill
Maher because he found uh he was annoyed
and he should have been that his team
was trying to turn that Liz Cheney thing
into saying that Trump wanted her to be
shot by a firing squad now that didn't
happen the context was he said she was a
Warhawk and you know she's sending
people to be have bull have guns pointed
at them but she wouldn't she wouldn't
love it if it happened to
her
um so of course it was all fake news so
Bill Mah to his credit called it down
unambiguously unambiguously as fake
news now I like that because you know
you could imagine that he could have
said something like well you
know in in the context of the other
things he said stuff like that one of
the other guests tried that and it just
sounded stupid but he was just
unambiguously saying stop stop just
lying about stuff it's not helping that
my own team is making such an obvious
lie now I I like
that uh he also mocked Comm Harris for
going to the black barber shop he had a
good joke about that but uh I'd like to
uh I'd like to return the favor
so Bill Mara thank you for standing up
for honesty even if your team is you
know uh hurt by it um but I heard a
story yesterday that I didn't believe so
I didn't look into it and then I did
look into it and then I found out oh
that's why I didn't believe it it was so
stupid that obviously it was fake so
there's a story that Tim Walls uh
insulted Elon Musk by calling him gay in
public first of all as Elon Musk is fast
to point out it's not an insult to be
called Gay it's 2024
people it's just not an insult
it's must got exactly the right answer
it's like that's not an insult that
would be a statement of something that's
either true or true or false that that's
all it
is um and that's the good news it's the
good news that in 2024 smart people can
say that's not an insult
um but then I listened to what wal said
and what he said was uh he meant to say
guy but he slurred it and said gay and
then when he realized it came in as gay
instead of guy he joked and said
Michigan knows what that word means and
then Republicans took Michigan knows
what that word means to suggest that he
was suggesting uh that it was an insult
to be called
Gay nobody in the world believes that
Tim wal thinks it's an insult to be
called Gay can we be a little bit
realistic no he did not say that
Michigan thinks that being gay is bad
it's the opposite Michigan knows what
that word means means that people in
Michigan are completely okay with gay
they know what it means it's it's just
nothing there's nothing to it he laughed
it off this is not a real thing he did
not call anybody gay and he definitely
didn't think there was anything wrong
with being gay that didn't happen so I
do this in the spirit of Bill Mah was
willing to say his team was lying um I
think this is Republicans just
lying uh let's
see uh and even Jake Tapper breit bar
news is reporting this Jake Tapper fact
checked Harris for some of her lies
which you would think oh that's that's a
good sign for CNN but I'm going to tell
you it's not in a moment but here's what
uh he said he said they had two tiny
little fact
checks uh because Harris said uh did
quote did everyone hear that uh Trump
said yesterday that he will do what he
wants quote and here's what I'm going to
quote do whether the women like it or
not so so Harris is saying he's going to
do things to women whether they like it
or
not uh and then she says must vote this
is the thing you know there's a saying
that you have to listen to people when
they tell you who they are and this is
not the first time he has told us who he
is he does not believe women should have
the agency and authority to make
decisions about their own
bodies so even Jake Tapper couldn't take
that goes two tiny little fact checks
first of all she keeps referring to the
Trump proposal on tariffs as a sales tax
it's not a sales tax uh you can dispute
tariffs but not not whether it's a sales
tax
and the second thing is when Trump said
he was going to do something for women
whether they like it or not um he was
talking about protecting
women and certainly you can take issue
with language but he wasn't saying he
was just going to do whatever he wanted
regardless he was he was going to
protect them now you would say to
yourself hey that's a good sign that's
CNN doing a a real fact check on KL
Harris is
it I'm going to go the opposite
direction
I think this is CNN protecting himself
so they can say hey we did a fact check
but what they don't do is the real ones
so they don't do January 6 was not a
real Insurrection they don't do the fine
people hoax was a hoax they don't do the
drinking bleach that was a hoax they
don't do the other 20 hoaxes no they'll
they'll fact check these little ones
that you knew were not true because you
knew they were not true but if you can't
tell if it's true well they're going to
sell it to you as true if it's good for
them so don't take this as good news
take this as covering their ass in case
somebody says but you've never fact
checked the other side but yeah we did
we said that tariffs are not a sales tax
you knew that we all knew
it all
right CNN is uh pointing out that Trump
is seeming to do a better job getting
both um Muslim Americans and Jewish
Americans to vote for him which is a
hell of a
thing uh I think it was Joel poock was
pointing out in Breitbart that Trump's
done the impossible politically which
he's got American Muslim and American
Jews on his side at the same time and I
I've been watching that happen and I the
more I look at it I think I what am I
even saying like what am I watching like
how is that even possible and and then I
I started to understand how it's
possible it's because of his
messaging when when when Trump talks
about war he says I don't want people to
die that's so powerful it sounds like
he's avoiding the question doesn't it
like you want him to take sides and what
are you going to do and he starts with I
don't want people to
die you can't do better than
that that has to be your starting point
because that if you say later well you
know I want to cease fire if that's what
he wants later well then that's all
compatible no matter what happens after
that he's compatible as long as he stays
with I want fewer people to
die and but Harris tries to take both
sides like if she's talking to one group
it might sound pro-jewish if she's
talking to the other it might sound a
little less pro-jewish so then both
sides can take something she said and
make her look bad to the other side side
but Trump says things that are hard to
disagree
with that he says it wouldn't happened
if I'd been
president and you think well I don't
know maybe it would have but okay see
it's not taking sides he's just saying
it wouldn't have happened and I don't
want anybody to die and of course you
know October 7th was terrible everybody
could say that so Trump is very very
cleverly finding there is no middle
ground and he somehow found a high
ground I guess that's the way to say it
there is no middle ground so instead he
found The High Ground The High Ground is
I don't want anybody to die and that's
consistent with everything else he says
right he doesn't want abortion in later
months because he doesn't want anybody
to die he doesn't want uh open
borders because he doesn't want anybody
to die he's in favor
of um
he's in favor of
IVF because he wants more people to live
he's very consistent on life you have to
give him that you you can say he's a
bullshitter I agree you can say he
doesn't pass the factchecking I agree
but he is consistent as hell about Laing
life over
death and you got to like that you got
to like
that uh according to Nina janowitz whose
name you already might remember some
would call her I think Molly Hemingway
called her a censorship activist
practitioner sort of a Democrat who has
worked in those areas where they're
trying to tell social media to uh change
their messaging if they don't like it
and uh she says that 2020 was different
because number one now platforms aren't
creating some friction for the spread of
misinformation so in other words there's
more free speech now she would say
there's no there's not enough friction
on the spread of
misinformation but that allows her to
determine what is
misinformation that's that's no way no
she says also there's less frequent and
robust coordination between federal
government and Platforms in other words
there's less
censorship so Nina janowitz is worrying
that the election might be influenced by
Free
Speech Free Speech does bring with it
misinformation but do you know what
brings more
misinformation lack of free
speech this is amazing I'm seeing a I'm
seeing an actual uh post this is in the
comments this is from um 2017
and Elon Musk posts I love Twitter so
it's
2017 and uh somebody named Dave Smith
not it's not comic Dave Smith it's just
somebody named Dave Smith says you
should buy it then remember this is this
is
2017 you should buy it then and Elon
Musk replies to him how much is
it in 2017 he was thinking about buying
it that is
interesting all
right um there is a uh there's a thought
that the Amish might be deciding the
deciding demographic for Trump because
they they seem to be a little more Pro
Trump and one of the reasons is there uh
I didn't know this but the Amish
traditionally are a farming Community
but the people who own the Farms already
own all the land so so the the the Young
Generation can't also be
Farmers because there's not not enough
land where they're also
Amish so a lot of them just started
businesses and uh they tend to be
Republican likee in their in their you
know free market kind of uh thinking and
uh I want to read to you what Scott
presler said recently during a trump
rally when he was speaking to the Amish
and this gets back to your the earlier
point I made about can experts know what
is a good persuasive message compared to
just an average person and this uh I
would say that uh Scott presler is
definitely not an average person uh he
he's I would put him in the expert
category in politics at this point but
do you think that he nailed this
persuasion right I read it to you tell
me if you feel it that that's the key
tell me if you feel it now you're not
Amish so this is not meant for you but
but see if you could judge whether you
would just feel
it quote to our beautiful Amish in
Lancaster in Pennsylvania and across the
state we will protect your raw milk your
Dairy your farming your school choice
your religious freedom your ability to
have 10 beautiful children per
family
wow wow It's Kind of
Perfect now do you feel
it you can feel that right if if you
tell me that Scott presler is unable to
do persuasion and persuasive messages
better than the average person and
better than the average professional I
would say you're clearly
wrong this this is good
work yeah that hits everything I don't
know I think it's because because I had
a lot I have a lot of farm experience so
it used to be my job at my uncle's farm
that was walking distance from my house
uh I would walk there or ride my bike
and clean the bulk tank now the bulk
tank buk was a giant um metal holding
tank for the milk that came from the
cows that same day now it would only be
in the tank for I half a day until a big
truck would come and suck it out and
take it away and so has to clean it and
sterilize it so and then my family would
drink raw milk from the farm because my
mother insulted the milk company and
they wouldn't they wouldn't wouldn't
deliver to our house anymore so we had
to get our milk from my uncle but it was
you know it was walking distance so it
wasn't a big deal um so raw milk is sort
of in my blood so to speak you know what
I mean farming sort of in my blood I
spent a lot of time on a farm
and when I hear these things they just
completely hit me we're going to protect
your raw
milk that like goes so
deep it's just it's just
beautiful anyway the hill is talking
about uh uh here's a headline that I
didn't read the story former president
Trump's vows for Revenge fa few
limitations in second
term I chose not to read the story that
that headline is attached to
let me read it
again former president Trump's vows for
Revenge face few limitations in second
term his vows for
Revenge when did that
happen can you show me the quote where
he vowed
Revenge do you think he ever used that
word I don't think so no no I don't
think so I think he said that there are
enemies
within and that if they committed crimes
you know the legal system should deal
with
them but nobody's Above the Law so I'm
going to say that's just a propaganda
story and uh I would say that any
president who wanted to get revenge
would find that there are not many
limitations didn't Obama use the IRS to
get at his
enemies you know didn't Obama drone an
American
once the American president can get a
lot of Revenge so yeah I mean obviously
anybody can
but we do not we do not approve of trump
getting revenge we only approve of the
law being
followed uh Washington State Governor
Jay Insley is activating the National
Guard unless there in case there's
trouble after the
election but it turns out according to
Reuters that Democrats are preparing
phase one of the cheat now this is me
speaking speculatively and allegedly and
hypothetically I am not aware of any
factual uh basis for what I'm about to
say I'm just saying that it looks
exactly like what you would do if you
were planning to rig an
election that doesn't mean they're going
to I'm going to I'm going to tell you
what I'm talking about and you tell me
does this sound exactly like Democrats
expect to lose the
vote but they have a plan for winning
the presidency
all right I'll just tell you what the
story is so according to Reuters uh
Democrats are reading a rapid fire
response to flood social media and the
airwaves with calls for common patience
with vote counting should Trump uh try
to prematurely claim election Victory as
he did in
2020 so let's say Trump is winning in
the
landslide and it's 10:00 at night
and um he reasonably believes that
unless there's cheating he's going to
win and he declares
Victory You could argue he shouldn't do
that until the election is done but in
politics that's a thing that happens you
know it's not that unusual if you really
think you're going to win you claim
victory but you probably doesn't want to
do that if there's anybody still voting
so you'd have to make sure all voting is
done before you do any claim claiming a
victory but to me it sounds like what
they just announced is a propaganda and
stalling operation until they have time
to complete the cheat in other words
they need to make sure that the media
does not embrace the thought that Trump
won because they're going to plan to
change their minds by altering the vote
afterwards again I have no evidence of
that this is not a factual conversation
this is based on exactly what it looks
like what it looks like is they're
telling us very clearly that they're
going to confuse the the public medium
of conversation to make it look like
Trump did not win and again the the the
hypothetical is we don't know if he W or
not in the hypothetical but in the
hypothetical he claims Victory so they
have a
plan to make sure that they can stall
that situation long enough that they've
completed counting the vote now if that
doesn't sound like a plan to
cheat you're not as suspicious as I
am because that's exactly what you would
do if you plan to lose but cheat after
the after the numbers come in so you
know how much to cheat by so we do not
have any factual there is there's no
factual uh evidence of a plan to
cheap there is however F factual
evidence of a plan that would be 100%
compatible with
cheating doesn't mean that's the reason
it's just coincidentally 100% compatible
and I've never seen anything like it so
seems like it's something you need every
year but this year they seem to think
they need
it anyway um in other news the United
States is deploying uh B 52 bombers and
fighter jets and refueling
aircraft um and Navy destroyers to the
Middle
East so let's see where are we um Iran
missil Israel a while ago and then
Israel attacked back and now I think
Iran is saying they might attack back
for the attack back I'm getting lost in
who's going first and who's going last
but uh as I've SE said a number of times
and this is not a prediction it's just a
statement of the
obvious Americans are really really
distracted this month this week but this
month you all agree with that right no
matter what happens the election is
absorbing everybody who has any any kind
of geopolitical Interest whatsoever
we're all just totally absorbed by it we
don't even care about the the the we
don't even care about the government
recovering uh
UFOs couldn't care less just tell us
about this
selection well when we're this
distracted and uh Israel's in exactly
the situation they
are if they were ever planning to do a
decapitation strike on
Iran it's going to be like in a
week now if I were the supreme leader I
would do some little extra hiding like
if you've got a really a good bunker I'd
be using the good
one because uh while I don't think it's
necessarily a good idea to take out the
leader of Iran because you don't know
what would happen it would be a very
unstable
situation uh I also don't know that it's
a bad
idea so I guess I'm I'm just an observer
I I don't prefer it I don't unpr prefer
it I don't condemn it I don't praise it
I'm just
watching and
I've never seen a situation where this
many variables came together so
obviously coincidentally at the same
time it's just the perfect
time because America just we just don't
have anybody strong enough to deal with
it we would just have to we would say
strong words about how we don't like it
Trump would say oh it wouldn't have
happened if I'd been president uh Biden
would say oh we we need to calm
down but nothing would happen I mean
it's not like somebody's going to take
funding away from Israel we would just
go on with our own little
problems so it's not a prediction and
it's not a preference that there's a
decapitation strike I'm just telling you
that if you're were going to predict the
future uh I wouldn't Overlook the fact
that there's never been and never will
be a time in the history of those two
countries for Israel to take a decisive
action so wouldn't be surprised now
remember there are a 100 variables that
I would not be aware
of so you know Israel has a much better
idea if that's a good idea or a bad idea
they have a much better idea if they
could get away with it they have a much
better idea what the public in Iran
would do they have a much better idea if
they could defend themselves from a
Counterattack so I don't know you know
90% of what I would need to know to know
if it's a go I'm just saying that from
purely the political standpoint you're
never going to get a better shot than
that so uh and I'm not I'm not anxious
to have that happen because that would
be real destabilizing for the world and
uh I'm not looking forward to
that but it might but it might that
ladies and gentlemen are the prepared
