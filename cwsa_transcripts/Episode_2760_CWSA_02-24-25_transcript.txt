good morning let's get our comments
working and then we'll have some then
we'll have it
all no reason to settle for
less all right why is this not
working there we go now was
working everything's
working except the government employees
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams you've
never had a better time but if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a CER buger glass
tanker Chell suin a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dopamine the day the thing that
makes everything better I hope it's
called the simultaneous hi happens now
go
tremendous so good well I'd like to
apologize in advance in case I fall
asleep sometime during this
show uh you know the three things that
you need to do to feel good good you
need to get your sleep you need to eat
right and you need to
exercise those are three things I
haven't been able to do for about a
month so I'm uh I'm on my last thread
here so I've got a little brain fog
going on so whatever you think is the
best this show could be dial it back
about 40% and you'll be
good well as you know everybody's
talking about Doge and should we be uh
cutting with an axe or cutting with a
scalpel so I've decided that uh
Dilbert's company is GNA go through the
same thing so Dilbert's
CEO uh is going to wait what's
that
um wow so uh Dilbert's company the CEO
is going to ask uh the pointy a boss to
make some deep Cuts but with a scalpel
not enough Max how do you think that's
going to go well let me give you an
idea uh CEO 2. a boss um I need to make
some deep Cuts got to cut uh
20% and uh since you're the manager who
knows what everybody's doing you you can
do it with a scalpel otherwise I'd have
to do it with an axe because I don't
know what anybody does so the pointy a
manager goes away and he says all right
give me a month to study it and I'll
come back with some
recommendations month later the pointy a
boss comes back and says I studied
everything talk to every person that
works for me and uh we decided that we
need more money not
less uh okay the the job was to cut 20%
yeah I know but it turns out that when I
took the scalpel uh as opposed to the
axe everything looked like it was
necessary so nothing to cut and we
really need to expand a few things so
I'll need about 20%
more uh you really need to find a way to
cut all right I've got an idea how about
this how about you fire my rival in
another department and then fold that
company's that department under me and
then you save some money with that other
guy and then the CEO says well that
other guy said the same thing about you
how about we fire you and fold your
department under
him and uh
then the CEO says all right give me a
list of all your projects we'll find
something to cut and then he looks at
the projects and realize he he doesn't
know what any of them really are because
they're just names of
things and so the CEO says well what
about this one and then the poter here
boss says oh no you can't cut that one
that that one's essential all right what
about this one oh my goodness if you cut
that we'll all die by this afternoon all
right but what about this one
no that one's going to have to increase
the budget we're going to need twice as
much budget for that
one do you think it works to do a
scalpel scalpel might work up to 5 or
10% but if you're trying to make it deep
cut I don't think it's going to
work um here's some zubie wisdom you all
know
zubie um how do you how do you even
describe zuie he's so many things at the
same time anyway zuie says the biggest
reason why Western Society is in trouble
is that the culture dictates that
telling Inconvenient Truth is hateful
and feelings are more important than the
truth as a result people are in a
constant state of lying and denying of
reality and nothing gets fixed right we
are in a continuous state of lying to
each other about everything all the
time
um so here's here's some uh
some Inconvenient Truth I'm just going
to say the thing that I haven't seen
anybody
say uh I tend to watch a lot of uh you
know YouTube about ancient
civilizations and I love it when we dig
up some new ancient civilization that
used to be quite Advanced for its time
but now it's completely
gone and then I say to myself huh why
didn't any of those ancient
civilizations including you know the
really powerful ones like Rome why
didn't any of them
survive and then I think well the United
States is different because the United
States has figured out you know how to
solve all kinds of problems and you know
we're not going to run into any big
problem so we'll probably survive for a
long time but the US has only been
around a few hundred years that's really
not very
long and there's some thinking that the
reason that prior greatness of izations
failed is that they spent themselves
into
debt and that there's something that
happens every time that when a
civilization gets to some really good
level uh they just overspend and then
they they're broke now of course in the
old days they were also overrun by
Marauders and probably had some diseases
that they couldn't handle and stuff like
that but generally
speaking it's quite sobering to see that
100 % of great civilizations failed all
of
them and now we're looking at the United
States with a debt that couldn't
possibly be paid back unless we did
something really drastic which is what
doge is trying to do so the thing you
got to know is that here are your two
possibilities you get let's say you do
the careful reasoned Cuts with a
scalpel versus doing something that
people people would call chaotic and
maybe he doesn't have much empathy and
it's just an Axe and all that let's say
those are the two
conditions which one do you think has a
better chance of
working now I would say given that what
we're looking at is an existential
threat meaning that our debt literally
will kill us in just a few years the
entire United States is gone in a few
years if we don't get it under control
now musk knows that that's why he's he's
all in but I don't know if the country
knows it because we don't say that
honestly to to Zubie's point we we
pretend like well if we just do business
as normal and make a few strategic cuts
and you treat everybody nice we should
be in good
shape but I don't think anything like
that is possible I think if we make some
nice strategic little cuts and
everybody's happy with them how well
thought out they are
we we're not even going to be close to
saving the country like actually
survival so when I look at the scalpel
idea I see Zero chance of it working
zero when I look at the MX version I say
that could terribly go wrong you know
it's easy to imagine how it could go
wrong but it's the only thing that might
go right so if the scalpel is a definite
failure
because here's what here's what uh
musk's um opponents seem to pretend they
pretend that we don't have a like a deep
existential threat and it isn't really
close that if you looked into it and
said you know we could cut 5% out of
this department and 5% of that and we
really thought about it and we'll treat
everybody
nice I don't think that could work I I
think that would be a way to cut 5% the
budget it would make no difference to
our survival if you want to
survive you might have to you know
remove the leg and you know take care of
it
so I guess that's where the critics and
I diverge if you think there's any way
to
survive survive scalpel
Cuts I don't think there is I I see
nothing that would suggest we could
survive just going slowly and carefully
I don't think that's
survivable the me a could be a problem
or it might
work but there's only one path that
might work so I'm I'm all in on the path
that might
work
anyway uh let's let's talk about some
good news for Trump the American Bar
Association just suspended their Dei
requirements according to the Gateway
pundit
Cassandra McDonald's reporting um so it
suspended law school diversity equity
and inclusion requirements now is that
the Trump effect because I don't believe
Trump ordered that or there's no
executive order on that right and you
wouldn't have any say in it anyway so it
feels like the American Bar Association
is sort of the canary in the coal mine
meaning if they go early if they if they
throw Dei out early it's probably
because a whole bunch of lawyers think
that there's going to be a legal risk if
you keep doing it and there should be
there should be a legal risk to
discrimination so if the American Bar
Association is getting rid of Dei that's
probably a really good sign for what's
ahead well you all know the word of the
day the word of the day is banino
I've never seen people so happy you know
I guess cash Patel made people pretty
happy and of course I was very happy
about RFK Jr and tulsy made a lot of
people happy when she got appointed but
Dan banino has been tapped to be the new
deputy director of the
FBI and I don't believe that requires
any uh Congressional
approval um but I did not know how
impressive bongino's background is I
knew some of it and I I've told you one
of the things I like about him is he's a
talent stack guy meaning that he just
keeps acquiring new talents and adding
them to the ones he has and then he's
got this super powerful package of
talents but I didn't know he has two
Advanced
degrees um I think he has now this might
be wrong because I think it came from an
AI but I think he has a master's degree
and then he's got an
MBA um he's worked in the police
department he did a did a secret service
agent uh job and now he's got all of the
uh public communication skills too so he
knows media he knows everything about
law law enforcement and he's Highly
Educated so um and you know I think
character is probably even a bigger
thing he's not exactly the kind of guy
who's going to back off if you know what
I mean
banino strikes me as the kind who would
you know chew through a brick wall if
there was a reason to do it you just
need a reason he does not look like the
kind of guy who's going to shrink from a
task because it's
difficult so I think all of us are
inspired by that because he's such a
fighter and he has just an ridiculous
amount of skills at this point just
ridiculous I have so much respect for
that anyway so congratul ations to Dan
Bonino and
uh I know all of you are thinking oh the
Russia collusion hoax Adam
Schiff there's going to be some good
arrests coming maybe we'll see I won't
make any predictions about any specific
things that will be uh investigated but
it's all good news uh
meanwhile um Pam bondi's Department of
Justice apparently according to the
Western joural they launched a fraud
investigation on United
Health now you remember United Health
the their CEO is the one who was gunned
down on the street but United Health is
uh maybe the
biggest uh in terms of their uh is it
mostly health insurance I guess so
they've uh apparently they're being
investigated for Medicare bilding
practices which would suggest that
somebody thinks um
so somebody
thinks see this is the brain fog I can't
look at a comment and then remember what
what I was talking about so it suggests
that somebody thinks United Health may
have been cheating on some big stuff and
that could be
big um speaking of cheating on the big
stuff you know you've been hearing for
years that uh Haiti was a situation
where a whole bunch of money billions of
dollars were given to to 0 for recovery
from their 2010 hurricane and the entire
time we kept thinking people kept saying
it's a grift it's the the Clinton
Foundation has found a way to steal your
money and the whole time I thought well
yeah there might be some of that you
know when you when you're slashing
around that much money yeah there's
could to be some of that that gets to
the wrong places but I thought mostly
mostly it probably got to where it was
supposed to
turns out that might be wrong um and
it's a little too early to know how much
of this is true it's a little fog of War
situation but according to Zero
Hedge um some Haitian reporters had been
warning about disappearing money for
years and US
Aid um was the I guess the big funding
organization and some of it was
dispersed through the Clinton
Foundation all right so as us ad it was
billions of dollars for 80 and some of
it was funneled through the Clinton
Foundation now that doesn't mean there's
any crime it's just that it's everything
you would expect if there were a
crime it looks exactly like the setup
for a
crime but the uh allegation here is that
only 2% of the 4.4 billion that was
allotted for Haitian relief and actually
got used in Haiti so where did the rest
of the money go well allegedly the New
York Post says that 56% of that money
for Haiti went to firms located in or
near the US capital and apparently the
money stayed
there
so here's how it goes there's a disaster
in Haiti the US government allocates 4.4
billion goes into that
usaid bucket and then from there it goes
to a whole bunch of Nos and consultants
and contractors and then only 2% of it
got spent on
Haiti I feel like I'd have to hear the
other side of that story because that's
a little hard to believe you know it's a
little too on the nose 2% come on but on
the other hand maybe I mean one thing we
can all tell is that Haiti doesn't seem
to be a bit better uh if
anything so what if that that's
true what if it's
true you know there there's no
investigation opened up as far as I know
so I think I'm not going to treat it as
a fact until I hear there's an
investigation opened and even then I
shouldn't treat it as a fact but uh if
there's no
investigation it just feels like talk at
this point I do think it's possible that
these numbers are right on and that
there's a ton of money just missing but
uh I wouldn't I wouldn't say for sure
yet well here's some more good news for
Trump according to pollster Frank
luns um that 33 days into Trump's
term uh he has a higher approval rating
the any point during his first
term are you having the uh the same
weird situation that I am I'll turn on
the news and it'll be some you know
Democrat oriented news it'll say oh
Trump's approval has plunged it's
plunged and sure enough it looks like it
went from you know uh unusually high to
lower fairly quickly now the first
thing the first thing you need to know
is
that um if you're comparing what Trump
was to
himself and it used to be at an all-time
high but now it's lower there's always a
honeymoon when you first get in and then
there's always a pullback so one month
after you get into office I would expect
every president's approval to be lower
because you have all these you know
lofty Ambitions when you get that new
person it's like oh they're going to do
so much then a month later the news has
completely destroyed them you know by
picking at them here and there and then
you're like H but I do think Frank Lun
has the the right metric which which is
if it's the if it's still the best that
Trump has ever done even though he's I
guess you how could it be the best he's
ever done if he used to be higher well I
guess there's some
uh there's some discrepancy in the
polling do you believe that the polling
is um
rigged I do I I I think that at least
some of the polls and I'm not going to
name names but some of the big name
polls I think they're rigged when it
comes to politics so I don't know what
to believe there but according to
rasmuson 62% of the voter the voting
public uh backs Trump's deportation
policy
62% so that's helping
him it is it is really impressive I mean
everybody says it too much but it's very
impressive that Trump and Homan did in
fact get control of the border so
quickly and it certainly validated
everything they said about Biden
CU remember all those years when Biden
and Harris would say oh there's nothing
we could
do nothing we could do uh I don't know
what could we do and then they would lie
about um how illegal Crossings went down
and the way they would lie is that they
made illegal Crossings illegal they they
just hired more people so they could
claim uh Asylum and if you're claiming
Asylum you're legal until proven
otherwise so all they did was legalize
illegality and then they claimed as a
victory I I think the the extent of the
Biden Administration evil I don't know
if we'll ever see the bottom of it uh in
in my view he they were totally corrupt
and totally evil uh but because he was
such a smiley good guy he just sort of
got away with it like
Hunter uh pollster Mark Penn who worked
for the the clintons and uh anyway just
just so you know he's working for
Democrats uh he said uh on the Laura
Ingram show he said I've got some new
polling coming out on Monday that would
be today uh that I've just looked at
frankly the Democratic party is falling
off a cliff uh the ratings were in the
high 40s and they're going to be like
35% and uh and the basic question on
who's doing a better job as President
Biden or Trump trump is winning that
with with 57%
so Trump's looking really strong right
now and if you're reading the uh you
know the
critics you would come to the opposite
conclusion so uh you probably saw that
uh uh what's his name
uh uh Carville James Carville is
predicting that the the administration
will collapse in 30
days I don't see any indication of that
whatsoever that so that's sort of a
wishful thinking thing if he's right
it'll look like he's psychic and if he's
not we won't remember he said it so it's
a smart
prediction um in more sign of the time
news you already know that MSNBC is
doing a shakeup and
they they got rid of Joy
Reed um but they just had a legal
analyst on who said that Trump's not
really losing the legal battles but if
you were to read the news you would
think Trump is losing all over the place
it's like oh the court put a stay on
this and the court said this is not
specific enough and the court said this
and I actually thought that I actually
thought you know wow seems like Trump is
really getting beaten back in a lot of
these legal cases but msnbc's own legal
analyst said quote these are not major
setbacks uh and that Trump's going to
fight at every turn and that means
appealing everything uh because it
doesn't cost them anything to appeal I
don't know how that's true but that's
what he said so in many cases the thing
that the court halted they didn't halt
it permanently they just said oh put a
put a pause on that a stay and you know
give us some time to look at it and then
we'll figure out if it's legal or not so
in many of those cases time will go by
they'll look at it and go Okay carry on
you know we we took some time to look at
it but looks fine and uh and plus he's
going to win some on
appeal so the lawfare against
Trump once
again not
working not
working more good news for Trump and the
country uh Apple announced it's going to
bring $500 billion in Investments to
expand Manufacturing in the and create
thousands of jobs now that's pretty big
deal it's a very big deal it's over four
years but still 500 billion
um and may I hope because now there have
been several announcements from Big
entities about bringing money to the
United States the only
way that the us is going to survive is
massively bringing back
manufacturing and it's beginning and
here's what's interesting if if Apple's
doing it it's going to be a strong
argument for anybody to do it and if and
if you're in a company that is not
planning to do it while apple is
definitely planning to do it you're
going to have to explain why you can't
do it so it's it's not just big in terms
of dollars it's big in terms of how we
think about it because if Apple can
commit to this and you would expect
Apple to really be caring about you know
margins and stuff like that but if Apple
thinks they can make this
work and I think some of it is
acknowledgement that Manufacturing in
China for example is not as safe as it
used to be if it ever
was so that's good news you probably all
know that
uh um Elon Musk and Doge and Trump have
ordered a government workers who work
remotely to get back to work so starting
this week according to on musk starting
this week people who fail to return to
the office to work will be placed on
administrative
leave administrative leave but what
about that email that uh that all the
government workers got that said you
should tell us uh this is from Doge that
you need to tell us what you
accomplished give us five bullet points
of things you accomplished this week now
of course people are going crazy it's
like what you know what about if you
can't have access to email what if
you're on vacation which is a thing in
the government I guess um
and people are complaining that uh
that's no way to run anything and are
these people going to be fired if they
don't respond well the one thing we seem
to know is that nobody's going to get
fired for not
responding but I do wonder what the
utility is now as I said before part of
the
utility I think nobody said this this my
own opinion is to just reframe how
serious working for the government
should be that if you're not
accomplishing things you're gone so
people will remember the email long
after you know it's it's tiny little
Mark on the world goes away because
they'll realize that if you don't report
some real accomplishments every week
your job's in danger now I don't see any
possibility that you know somebody like
Elon or anybody else could look through
all the emails to look at all their
accomplishments we wouldn't know if any
of them were true because anybody could
just lie how would you know it's not
even illegal to lie to the government
about what you
accomplished you're not going to jail
for it so people will make up some
stuffff and uh other people have real
accomplishments other people I guess um
several several parts of the government
are looking to ignore it I think cash
Patel told the FBI no don't do that we
have our own process for performance
reviews I think the state department and
the Pentagon pushed back so I don't know
how many of these emails they're going
to get but I think just asking for them
gives you a win because it just tells
you all right this is a new
day we're really going to look at your
performance now right now if the Doge
people plan to look at any of them and
they they said copy your manager so the
manager would be the one getting the you
know the five uh things you accomplished
as well as the
Doge at most the most I can see the Doge
could do with that would be run an AI
against it to look for ones that are
clearly fake and maybe also make some
recommendations about who's not doing
enough but you know most jobs are not
accomplishment oriented they're just
process so if your job is to just I
don't know process all requests that
come into your office
that should be enough I processed all
the all the requests that came into my
office that that should keep your job so
it shouldn't be hard but we'll keep an
eye on
that um Wall Street Journal was trying
to calculate how big the impact might be
on the economy for all these massive
government U firings so if you had these
75,000 resignations uh maybe
200,000 prob probationary employees
already
fired and maybe 200,000 in
attrition
and so they're they're thinking that uh
maybe in total 475,000 jobs but which is
a lot but it's worse because there will
also be a vendors who are selling things
that can't sell it and and all that but
to put it in perspective
um 475,000 jobs over a few
years we could absorb that um what about
the all the secondary effects about all
of the you know the vendors and stuff
the contractors well that's pretty big
and so even the 475,000 jobs would only
be 3% of the US's non-farm jobs so
they're not big percentages but in
certain places is like Washington DC
it's going to be a big impact and there
will be bankruptcies and there will be
dislocations and there will be
unemployment and it's going to be big
now a lot of it is spread in in over
different communities it's not all in
Washington DC just a lot of it is so
yeah it's going to be ugly but I'm going
to go back to my first
comment if that's the only way you can
save the country is by doing something
that's ugly and has an axe you have to
do that you have to do that so I have
complete empathy for the people losing
their jobs and those are real problems
you know I'm not going to I'm not going
to slight that at all but the
alternative to me it looks like we all
lose
everything so that's not too different
than uh private companies doing layoffs
a number of private companies are doing
layoffs right now um because the people
who get laid off and their families
definitely suffer no doubt about it but
if we didn't have
layoffs then the entire economy would
just be so unproductive that you know
nothing would work we'd all be dead so
yeah in the real world going back to
Zubie's comment where you can't say
what's true here's what I think is true
about Doge it will be really
painful and that pain will extend beyond
the people who get fired and it will
extend beyond the people who are
contractors and
vendors it will hurt there's just not
another
Choice uh unless you believe you can
scal R your way
and which I
don't yeah so I'm a little tired of
people saying the easy and obvious thing
and then pretending that Elon Musk
doesn't know so I'm going to add to my
list of dumb things that people say
about
Doge uh Scott
uh government is different than Private
Industry to which I say um who do you
think didn't know that do you think that
Elon Musk is going to wake up and read
your post and say whoa hold on hold
everything you're telling me that the
government is different from Private
Industry
what and and people talk like that's
actually a thing like that Elon Musk is
the only person in the world because we
all know it that government is different
than industry in lots of different ways
uh but somehow he doesn't know
it of course he knows it of course he
does now he might not know every Nuance
but that's what the Mex is going to do
and we'll correct as we need
to so it will hurt but I don't think
there's another way uh as you know we've
reported this already that the top
General in the military CQ Brown so he
was the uh Joint Chiefs of chat he was
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and uh
he was accused of being you know too
woke to
Dei and I didn't know what that meant
until I saw a compilation of his clips
and I had a few different observations
number one CQ Brown has the best voice
for leadership that you'll ever hear in
your life if you haven't heard him talk
I recommend it he's really got that
Command Voice like it has that resonance
and it's just you know he presents it
perfectly he's obviously very
smart um he's an impressive guy
impressive
guy however uh when you look at the
clips of his emphasis on Dei it really
is just flat out racist um he found aund
different ways to say I'm going to get
rid of the white people in
command now not by firing them
necessarily or I know what whatever you
do in the military Scott the military is
different than a private company I know
I know just go with it okay
um every way that he tried to explain it
just sounded like I'm going to make sure
there are fewer white people that's the
main goal fewer white
people
and he had to go
he that that has to be a firing offense
unfortunately because he did look like
he was quite capable in
general so he wasn't I don't I don't
think he was necessarily A de hire um
because if you put him next to Mark
Millie and you let both of them answer
questions for five minutes you would
think Mark Millie was the dumb
one so I'll just put that out there for
for uh
contrast all right um there's some news
about uh Trump is doing something to
charge Chinese
shipping uh tremendous amount of money
for using our
ports like a million dollars every time
they come into port and a million
dollars for something else so we'll see
if that becomes a real thing but like
the tariffs that
should um increase your costs in the
short run
now going back to zubie you you know we
can't say the
truth I'm going to say the truth there's
probably no way to get the lower costs
and get inflation really down to where
we want it without things getting worse
in the short run probably not because
this is a perfect example so essentially
the tariffs and whatever this is that
they're doing with the Chinese shipping
are ways to make it more expensive for
buying things overseas and having them
shipped here uh to encourage more
companies to just make it here in the
short run all it is going to be is more
expensive in the long run the collective
result of all these actions should bring
more manufacturing to the us give us
better
jobs bring prices down it's just that if
you're Trump you can't really say hold
on people it's going to be worse for at
least a year or two cuz that might be
the truth nobody wants to hear that we
all want to hear that the price of eggs
will be free tomorrow what I'm still
paying for gas I thought you'd have that
fixed by now it's been 33
days meanwhile Trump has demanded Trump
demanded that the Taliban return $7
billion worth of military equipment
unusual Wales is reporting that and I'm
thinking to myself really
wouldn't that be hilarious if the
Taliban said oh oh These are your jeeps
and helicopters oh yeah uh let's uh
we'll wipe them down and we'll have them
ready just come on over and pick it up
well I don't think that's going to
happen um so I don't think there's
really any chance that Taliban is going
to give back any any stuff so why did he
say it why did Trump even bring it up if
there's just no way it's going to happen
well
one way one reason might be I'm wrong
that maybe it could happen because Trump
keeps doing these things that don't look
possible you know like uh having some
control over Greenland or something then
next thing you know Greenland say you
know there is a way you could do that
and might be good for everybody so it
could be that he's opening up
negotiations might be opening up
negotiations for what I don't know but
we'll see
um Microsoft's uh CEO SAA Nadella was
doing a presentation uh just yesterday
maybe or this week on uh using AI to
increase Farm
yields and apparently it's a it's
already working on small farms the idea
is you'd put various sensors in your
field so you'd be measuring the quality
of the dirt and the moisture and
everything else and then the AI would
tell you what to do so it would say well
you better put a little more of this or
a little less of that on there and uh
the AI being smarter than people
according to uh SATA
Nadella uh it's already working and
there the small farms are getting big
increases in yields I don't know about
that I'm a little bit of skeptical that
there's much of a difference but be kind
of cool if there were
but uh in uh related news I didn't know
about this but this fascinates me um you
know that billionaire Larry Ellison
founder of Oracle uh did you know that
he bought the Hawaiian island of lahina
so he owns I think 98% of the island or
something and the Island used to grow
lots of pineapples that was the main
thing the island did but uh they I guess
they polluted the soil o and you can't
grow much of anything there Outdoors so
he put a half a billion dollars into
building indoor Farms that could serve
the island but the bigger ambition was
to make food you know fresh and nearby
to where you're going to eat it and just
really revolutionize the whole food
thing now if you've been watching me for
a while you know I just love the indoor
garden space I just love that cuz cuz I
feel like it's just going to happen that
at the moment at the moment there's
there's no indoor farm that could give
you the protein that you need and you
know would be easy to manage and all
that stuff it wouldn't be cost effective
but it feels like it could be like every
Instinct in my body says well probably
were one or two innovations away from
making indoor gardening really work but
after years of work um Ellison was
working with a company called Sensei Ag
and apparently just nothing works well
I'm I'm exaggerating not nothing but
they had all kinds of problems with
their structures they had problems with
their Wi-Fi um and instead of growing
like all the food you would need for you
know the island I think it's basically
lettuce and Tom and small Tomatoes or
something which they do sell but it's
just trivial so basically didn't work
the the experiment half a billion
dollars and looks like it didn't get
even close to working now that's the
Wall Street journal's reporting on
that so that was a little
disappointing and then uh the boring
company's got a deal according to new
Atlas uh they're going to build tunnels
under
Dubai so you know the tunnels aren't
that much bigger than a car and then
Dubai you'll be able to go underground
and Scoot around in your little Tesla in
these
tunnels now if you had told
me that that would be a thing in the
future that the boring company would
have big deals like in Las Vegas or or
Dubai and they'd be building underground
tunnels for individual cars I would have
said to you ah that doesn't sound like a
business so it's pretty
impressive uh I don't know if the boring
company makes money yet and I don't know
if it's cash positive but the fact it's
doing as much as it is is kind of
shocking um you I've been saying for
years that holes are the best technology
if we could figure out how to put a hole
in something it'd be
great but uh one of the things I saw uh
online is somebody was challenging me
saying U speaking of our billionaires
Larry ellon and and musk somebody was
challenging me about Doge well actually
it was just a post so it wasn't
challenging me personally and said
how would you like it if Doge were being
run by George
Soros so that was that was uh put
forward as a good argument well if it
were George Soros you know who leans
left how would you like it over on the
right now remember I always tell you
that analogies are not a form of
thinking they really aren't because in
this analogy they're comparing a devil
to an angel
yeah at least in the the opinion of
conservatives Soros would be like the
devil so if you put the devil in charge
of cutting the budget what do you think
is going to
happen versus Elon who seems to orient
all of his Investments toward you know
making the world safer you know allowing
us to be interplanetary so we'll survive
the next asteroid I mean all of it is
just
purely I mean makes money but that but
it's for the benefit of humankind so
you've got one person who seems to hate
humankind Soros and one person who loves
it so much that there's no amount of
work he won't do to make it better how
in the world do you think that's a good
analogy let's compare the darkest figure
in the world who might just want to
destroy the country to the happiest most
successful guy who only wants to make
things
better I mean that's crazy
talk
so
um yesterday if you were watching the
show yesterday and I had to quit rather
quickly at the end because there was
some loud noise in in the front of my
house uh it was a pretty serious car
accident so it wasn't on my property but
it was right by my driveway so a Uber
driver uh may have had a medical problem
it's not clear but drove at a pretty
high speed into a concrete uh barrier
and uh when I went outside after the
show there was just you know all kinds
of emergency vehicles and fire trucks
and police and and at first I was like I
hope this isn't about
me I hope nothing about this is about me
but it wasn't uh and then the Uber
driver was like when I went down to the
end of the driveway to see what was
going on the Uber driver was wildly
Justus ulating at me I still don't know
what that's about but he kept pointing
at me and blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
so I don't know maybe he was blaming me
so I don't know the answer to that
mystery but uh that's what that's what
the noise was all about all right uh
ladies and
gentlemen um that is the uh conclusion
of my show um I'm not feeling well this
month I'm going to get that taken care
of I hope in the next few days got a
doctor's appointment I think I have
pneumonia so I'm operating on you know
almost
nothing so we'll get that taken care of
and uh hopefully in a week or so I will
be back to a human
being um well getting some sleep is
impossible because I have a sciatica
and I have backaches sciatica
and I think
pneumonia which means that every
position I sleep in is deeply
painful so there is no sleep solution
the only thing I can do is sleep for 45
minutes wake up in
pain uh walk around until I'm too tired
to walk around fall asleep for 45
minutes and wake up in extreme pain
again so that's pretty much all I've
been doing for weeks so I'm in really
bad shape right now I'm just barely
hanging on to be honest but should be
able to take care of it this week we'll
see all right so that's enough of that
ladies and gentlemen thanks for joining
I'm going to talk to the locals people
privately the rest of you come back
tomorrow same time same
place all right
locals coming at you in 30
seconds
