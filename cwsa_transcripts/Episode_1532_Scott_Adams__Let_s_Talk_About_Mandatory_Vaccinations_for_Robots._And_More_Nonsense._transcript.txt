i wasn't going to be here
come on all you
youtubers
you know i wouldn't miss it
one minute delay little technical
problem
practically nothing
and
by now
you're starting to realize that
something special has happened
right
somehow you made it to the best place in
the world
seven plus billion people
wandering around lost but you my friends
made it to exactly the right place
and even before the time to start
very good very good if you'd like to
take it to another level all you need is
a copper margarita glass of thank you
tell us stein the canteen dragonfly sky
vessel of any kind
fill with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopey meat here today
the thing that makes everything better
except my throat it's called the
simultaneous
happens now go
ah
antibodies
yep
those antibodies are surging
now some of you
and i'm sorry uh youtube people
i hate to tell you but you missed this
last night was the prototype
first episode
of after dark with scott adams yes not
the simultaneous sip
but the simultaneous
folk
and
only the people on local
subscription service got to see that
yes we hung out in my man cave a good
time was had by all might do more of
that in the future
well how about the good news should we
start with that
shall we start with
the good news
here's the coolest news and the one i've
been waiting for
uh there's a company called
joby aviation cnn is reporting this
they have a they've developed at least a
prototype of a six-rotor
helicopter slash
airplane
now it's a slash airplane because it can
lift off with its six rotors like a
helicopter
so suddenly you don't need an airport
it can fly 200 miles an hour
do you know how fast a
a cessna flies
not that fast
so it's faster than a small airplane
it's actually
faster than a
pits which is an aerobatic plane
oh yeah i know all about planes
because i listen
somebody says 250 i think it depends on
the cessna but your typical cessna could
be you know if you're getting 160 180
wouldn't that be on the high end
145 for a typical cessna somebody's
saying anyway
it's quite it's electric did i mention
that it's electric
and it's safer than a helicopter because
there's six rotors i assume six engines
probably some redundancy i'm guessing
that if you lose one of the rotors
you're probably in pretty good shape to
finish your flight
guessing
um
and it'll go 150 miles on a charge at
200 miles an hour it'll seat
four passengers in one pilot
i think they solved everything
didn't they
it feels like they solved every problem
with flight
think about every problem you have with
flight
doesn't this
kind of solve most of them not the long
hauls but certainly the the shorter
flights
all right um
so that's pretty cool
looking forward to that
um
dr anarchy on twitter who's a real
doctor
um suggests that maybe when i was
talking about the havana syndrome being
a
mass hysteria
which i wouldn't say is confirmed yet
but at this point
that's the smart money is on mass
hysteria for the havana syndrome secret
sonic weapon and dr anarchy points out
you know it might be a mass hysteria
with this long coveted stuff
to which i say hmm
could be
because it does have the right
characteristics which is the news is
talking about it people are suggestible
and there's a whole bunch of gray area
stuff like brain fog headaches and loss
of appetite that people get anyway
so it's pretty
pretty easy to imagine that people would
be
you know imagining they're having more
problems than they have now let me be
let me be really specific here
i'm not suggesting that long coven isn't
real
i'm not suggesting it isn't real
i'm saying that whether it's real or not
almost certainly there are lots of um
fake or let's say misdiagnosed symptoms
that are just accidental and
coincidental so we don't know how big
that effect is
but if you think that you know
that long covert is real and that it's
you know
25 of the people who get it or whatever
the statistic is from some study i don't
think we know that
i don't think we know that i think uh
all we know is that it's reported
and so we have this bizarre situation
the most bizarre situation ever
what are all of us trying to do make
decisions based on data right
so 100 of us are making decisions based
on data
um now of course it's how much you trust
the data as well but we've come down to
the point we've actually evolved to the
point
where our decision on getting vaccinated
or not at least the individual's
decision
is based on comparing to
mass hysterias
two massive stereos
maybe
at the very least we don't know what the
date is
so if you're making your decision on
vaccination you're probably saying all
right what is the risk of getting
vaccinated and being being damaged by
the vaccination
do you know what the answer to that is
you don't know
you don't know the risk it can't be
known
you can know what they've found so far
and reported but that that's not the
same as what the risk is
now what about all the the anecdotal
reports of people having problems after
the vaccination
well there's enough noise on that
to say
it could be real
but it also could be
mass hysteria
how would it look different
if the reports of
uh vaccination damage and side effects
how would it look different if it were
mass hysteria
or completely real as many of you
believe
how would it look different
the answer is it wouldn't
it would look exactly the same if it
were a mass hysteria
as if the vaccination actually has lots
of side effects it would look exactly
the same
so you don't know what it is because it
would look exactly the same but which
one's more likely
i don't know
you know there are some cases where mass
hysteria is easy to spot let me give you
some examples
mass hysteria that the devil
has occupied
a bunch of people
easy because the devil claim would be so
unlikely
they're just on the face of it you say
that's a mass hysteria
the meg martin school kids case was an
obvious mass hysteria a bunch of people
believed in satanic worshipping
happening at a school
that's crazy
and it turned out it wasn't true
uh mass hysteria about witches
believing that witches are all around
and salem for example that was easy
because witches are real
so you say wait a minute you're
believing in something that's almost
certainly not real a witch probably a
mass hysteria
look at the havana syndrome
easy to spot as a mass hysteria
because really a secret sonic weapon
that's
just being used on american
i don't know
right so there's just an obvious thing
on the face of it this is
probably not true
like a ghost or a devil or a secret
sonic weapon
but what happens if you have a normal
situation
a normal situation is that
medicine
and vaccinations can have side effects
for some people
so you can't really spot a mass hysteria
in this case
because there's nothing on the face of
it
that's ridiculous
if you tell me but scott it is
ridiculous that all these smart people
would approve a drug that has all these
side effects
no that's not ridiculous
that's that's something you hope didn't
happen
i don't have a spoon
if i had a spoon i would clank it in my
coffee for sticks and hammer
uh if i had one
so
yeah there is no spoon
i don't have a spoon
sorry if i had one i would be happy to
comply
um
so
do you feel that you're making your
vaccination decision based on data
or
lack of trust for the source
which one do you think it is
because
the two data's that you're comparing
could be both mass hysterias we might
have a master's theory about vaccination
side effects
at the same time we have
a master stereo bout covered long haul
or
one of them could be real and the other
one not
or
both of them could be totally
real you don't know
how could you tell
how could you tell
so somebody says that they're basing
their decision more on lack of trust
based on the source
i would suggest to you
that no matter which way you go it's
because of lack of trust
lack of trust should be universal on
both sides of the question
you shouldn't trust anybody at this
point
really shouldn't trust anybody
so if the only people you're you're not
trusting are the government
you need to ramp up your skepticism at
least double
because the government is not the only
source of bad information
it's one of them
it's not the only one
so you would be comparing your
lack of trust in the government
to your more trusting belief that
you see on the internet is pretty good
so
we don't have data
and if you're using some kind of uh you
know in other words you can't use the
data to make a decision because we don't
have good enough data
but
if you're trying to game the system with
a rule of thumb like oh these people are
always lying or
this group let's say the government is
always trying to put one over on us or
the
the big pharma is lying about his
statistics
maybe all of that's true
but you know what else you can't trust
everything on the other side of the
argument
if you think one side of the argument is
credible
and the other isn't
where have you been lately
because i'll tell you what's not
happening
is you're not getting any credible
information
credible doesn't mean incorrect it just
means that you shouldn't believe it on
the surface
because you can't tell all you know is
it came from some source and it's a
source that's been wrong a lot before
either
people on the internet been wrong a lot
or the government
been wrong a lot
so how in the world are you convincing
yourself you're making a data-driven
decision
you know you're not right
though you know that
and and if you try to uh
game the system like i said with oh well
i don't need the data
because i can just look at the situation
and the players
and i can figure out which are the
credible players and which are not and
sort of that's that's how i'll make my
decision
you can't do that
you don't know who's lying to you
because they're all
not trustworthy
everybody including me
do you trust me
should you
well what the hell do i know about
uh medicine
i wouldn't trust me too much
i mean i
here's the most you should trust me this
is the maximum amount you should trust
me
you should trust me to be similar to the
way i have been in the past
is that fair
you should trust me to be the same
person i was you know a year ago i
haven't really changed that much that's
all you can trust
now if you said okay a year ago
you said some things that were
surprisingly good predictions
but you also got some notable things
wrong
is that a fair statement
is that a fair characterization of of me
that i had some impressive predictions
in the last five years let's say
but also
got some big stuff wrong like everybody
did is that is that a fair
characterization
so why would you trust me
how can you tell
that the next thing i make a prediction
on is a good one
if you could tell which of my
predictions were good ones then you
would be good at predicting you wouldn't
need me at all
if you could tell the good ones from the
bad ones
you can't
even i can't tell the good ones from the
bad ones
you know i have very varying levels of
confidence but that's different from
knowing what is
likely to be right
so
i think all of us need to get a little
more humble
about how we're making decisions
let me tell you what i learned on day
one in hypnosis class if there's anybody
on youtube watching
there might be three people who don't
know i'm a trained hypnotist
but the first day of hypnosis class
decades ago the first thing you learn is
that people don't use information to
make decisions
and when you hear it you're like well i
think that's an exaggeration
i mean
yes some people some decision yeah i see
what you mean but now you're into
outright hyperbole
because obviously people do use data to
make decisions
nope
nope
never
never
they just don't
they don't use data to make decisions
it's just an illusion that we do
now do we
make decisions that are in the same
direction as the data
and then they work out well
yes we do yes we do
we also
look at the data and misinterpret
and do things and sometimes that works
out well too
because we not only misinterpreted the
problem but we misinterpreted the answer
and we got lucky and our misinterpreted
problem was solved by our misinterpreted
answer
but mostly we're doing random stuff
or we're doing things because other
people say we should do them or we're
you know we're afraid to buck the
the other opinions or something like
that but does it have anything to do
with the data
we'd like to think so
but uh trust the
hypnotist
funniest story of the day is don lemon
doubling down
and defending cnn's uh characterization
of joe rogan's
covet treatment that included among
other things ivormectin the humankind
yeah yeah has anybody heard that before
that ivermectin comes in two forms
one the human kind
developed first very important later
became also a veterinarian
horse
dewormer
and don lemon has sanjay gupta on and he
he's uh he's doubling down on cnn's lie
now it's a lie of omission
right don lemon tries to go technical
he's like it's not a lie that ivor
meccan is a horse warmer and sanjay
uh to his everlasting lack of credit
agreed with that statement
sanjay
i just embarrassed myself by defending
you yesterday
you i just defended you in
public yesterday for being reasonable in
not defending cnn
for the dewormer stuff
and then he goes right on back on cnn
and lets the lie by omission stand
i mean seriously sanjay
um
we do expect a little more out of you if
i'm being honest because i know you have
more
i i will really reiterate
that i don't think dr sanjay gupta is
one of the bad guys
i think he's one of the good guys
but he also has a boss right if you have
a boss you're going to respond to it and
i would advise sanjay gupta
that he could push a lot harder on his
bosses and his co-workers without real
risk
because the only thing i would ask him
to say
is uh
it could be misleading to people
to not call this a human drug
first
it's worth pointing out if you'd like to
for context there's also horse dewormer
but that part is not relevant
whatsoever
to joe rogan's decision to take a human
drug
now that would be a good answer right
it would it would not directly call cnn
liars
but it would correct them and say you
know the
the
let's say the better context is to start
by saying it's a human drug
they can be
prescribed off-label
don't know if it works or not
the the evidence is not confirming that
it works
uh but it's not unusual for people to
take that kind of risk with such a
small chance of side effects
now if dr sanjay gupta said anything
like that
i'd say that's a pretty good answer it's
not really calling c now and now it has
liars
but he's fixing their context for them
don't you think he should do that
i feel like there's a ethical lapse
in this story
um i mean just from it's subjective
right you know you can't it's not an
objective thing but subjectively it
looks like an
ethical lapse not a big one
i mean it's smallish
but i feel if you're in the medical
field that you shouldn't have any of
those
and when you do
you should quickly circle back to
correct it because obviously you know
mistakes happen
but
i so that would be my my ask for dr
gupta if he had a chance to circle back
and just
just put a little context on that for us
it would just feel
feel a little better
all right
but the fact that don lemon is trying to
double down on that live by omission is
hilarious
um he's a broken man isn't he
don lemon looks broken
i mean he's got he's dealing with a
pretty serious
uh sexual harassment allegation
from a man who says he
that he got touched
we don't know if that's true
remember the context here is we don't
know if anything's true
it's just an allegation
but he's having a tough time with this
don lemon is
um i wish him well
so
here's a question for you i tweeted a
thread yesterday
in which i
reframed trump's challenging of the 2020
election
and
it got very few retweets
what's up with that
so
keep in mind here's some context when
most of you are claiming i think
twitter is shadow banning me and your
tweets don't show up
i was pretty much on the side of saying
that's probably an illusion
based on the fact that
not all tweets show up and there's their
reasons for it it might not be a bad
reason
but
i tweeted something that in any prior
time
i think would have been over a thousand
retweets easily just because the content
i'm reasonably good at guessing which of
my tweets will get
big responses and which won't
i have a pretty good track record of it
because the ones that go viral have
certain qualities to them
this one had all the qualities of a
viral tweet
and it just sat there and died when i
checked it was at 187
tweets
retweets
tweets i guess
what would you call it i guess it'd be a
retweet because i'm the original author
so
um and i'll tell you what the thread was
about in a minute but
is this an obvious shadow band
now the people who said they didn't get
it remember you don't get everybody's
everything
that's normal does everybody know that
it's normal
that you don't get everybody's every
tweet
you should know that's normal i think
there's a setting
that allows you to
see them all or see them according to
the algorithm or something right
now
you're wondering if it picked up a
keyword the algorithm did and suppress
this
i had 38 quote tweets
all right listen to this ratio there are
187 tweets
which would suggest a a low amount of
interest
based on the size of my follower base so
over
640 000 followers something like that
and for me to only get 187 tweets after
after a day
would be low
so that would be a low number of tweets
but 38 quote tweets
that's a lot
so it suggests that the people who did
see it
were very interested in engaging with it
but not many people saw it
so
what is the situation in which many
people are interested in engaging and
yet many people didn't engage how does
that happen
well am i reading too much into the data
yeah because sometimes you do get a lot
of quote tweets relative to the number
of tweets so i checked my history to see
if that ever happens and it does happen
in situations where
just people have a reason to comment
right it doesn't necessarily mean
something's up but it's a flag
right sort of a flag you say
maybe i should look at this a little
more
now would you be surprised if trump
being banned from twitter was not also
at least suppressed
so that other people don't just tweet
his material for him
because what would twitter do if
let's say um
let's say somebody like me
just to make it interesting let's say
somebody like me
makes a deal with trump and says hey
i'll i'll retweet everything you want me
to tweet
it'll just come from my account it'll
you could tell that it's from you
but i'll just be your official retweeter
now what would happen wouldn't twitter
shut you down
i mean they should right it makes sense
if they're gonna ban
if they're gonna ban the the author
which would be trump
wouldn't they necessarily need to ban
anybody who was just going to retweet
everything he said
now there are people who retweet
everything he said
but they tend to be smaller accounts and
they haven't really been picked up as
you know the way to follow him
if he if he actually gets in the race
i think those
let's call them what would you call
mirror accounts
or retweeter accounts or something i
think there will be a number of them
so you'll be able to follow trump
you'll just be following the the mirror
you know people do it being a mirror
now will all those people be banned
they should right i mean should
based on the consistency of the the
guidelines i would think
it's the same content so why wouldn't
you ban it
i don't know i don't know if they would
treat it that way but logically you
would imagine they might so here's my
question if trump himself is banned why
wouldn't
twitter also suppress
topics that are favorable to him
i feel like that just makes sense right
les trump is less trump they either
wanted more of him or less of him and
they decided to have less of him
so
let me tell you what i uh tweeted
and i need your help here okay
i'm asking for your help
i have a bias here that's pretty obvious
because i think my tweet was good
but i'm operating from deep bias
you have less bias relative to me on
this topic i want to see
if you can call out my bias on this
am i am i wrong all right here let me
tell you what the point is
so the point to the thread was this
that most people think trump is making a
terrible mistake
in continuing to hammer
and continuing to hammer on the 2020
election and also to continue to claim
that there was massive fraud and that
it's all been you know documented
now
number one how many of you think that's
a bad strategy or up until my tweet how
many of you thought that was a bad
strategy
to just keep hammering on that 2020
election
all right
now forget about whether he's right
we're not talking about right or wrong
we're only talking about strategy
all right so a lot of people saying uh
they think it's a bad strategy
all right so here's my argument for why
it's a good strategy
you ready
do you think i can convince you it's a
good strategy
how many think i can do that
here's the argument and it goes like
this
what are the odds
that at least one precinct somewhere in
all the precincts
can be found that was clearly fraud
now we're not looking at every precinct
so that doesn't mean we'll find it but
it's a big country
what are the odds that there's no
precincts which flipped from biden to
trump now remember a precinct is not a
state
and a precinct is not a county
precinct would be you know the smallest
unit
in in any large complex system
is the fraud
let's take the stock market
the stock market is policed pretty
pretty carefully
the stock market is also a big you know
big thing with lots of people involved
is there always
fraud in the stock market
yes yes the odds of finding fraud
in the stock market let's say next year
specific examples are 100
does everybody agree it's a hundred
percent
that they're that if you look for fraud
some just any example of fraud in the
stock market
next year
100 chance you would find it
yes right it's just obvious
now let's take a big pharmaceutical
company pick anyone
they've got lots of products lots of
trials lots of things do you think
that in any big pharma company even one
that you respect
do you think that if you could somehow
look at all the things they're doing
like all the employee decisions the
studies and everything you think you'd
find any corruption
in a big pharmaceutical company just one
person doing one corrupt thing do you
think
yes and what are the odds you would find
it what are the odds
100
i mean if you have the ability to look
for it you don't always have the ability
to look for it but if you could
it would be 100
you don't know how big it is i'm not
saying it was big enough to
you know recall a drug or anything like
that
but yeah 100
um
how about the government
let's take congress
congress is a pretty big body of people
what are the odds
that there's not one person in congress
who's somewhat explicitly taking a bribe
zero
right
even if you believe congress is mostly
pretty honest because we're watching
them pretty closely
what are the odds that at least one
person
is doing something that's close to maybe
it's legal but in effect it's a bribe
you have something unethical
what are the odds at least one
congressman will do that next year it's
a hundred percent
right it's a hundred percent all right
now let's get back to the election
so the election is you know thousands
and thousands of people
operating semi-independently all over
the country every precinct is managed in
its own way with its own people
a vast
process
what are the odds
that one of those precincts
cheated in a way that's that flipped it
from and intentionally cheated from the
way they flipped it from biden to trump
just one of them
all
how many precincts are there somebody to
be a
how many precincts are there in the
country just google that and put it in
the comments for a second
yeah 100
now look at trump's bet
does trump need to prove to you
that enough votes were flipped
change the election results does trump
need to prove to you
in court
that there were enough votes flipped
to change the election he does not
because you know why
you all operate on anecdotes
you need one good example that you
believe for sure
arizona is kind of sketchy isn't it
because even the people who ordered it
said you know
maybe
we're a little uncomfortable
but
we can't say for sure
it was rigged
but what if he had one precinct
where the question was asked and
answered and everybody knew it was
rigged
even the democrats said oh okay that was
rigged
but it's small it's small it's just one
precinct nobody's proving that the
election was rigged just one precinct
if trump gets one precinct
that even democrats can see was clearly
fraud
he's your next president
because how does january 6 look
if he can find one precinct just one
that there was fraud
suddenly january 6 looks really
different doesn't it
now it doesn't make any of the crimes go
away right anybody who engaged in
violence
will pay a price and i'm happy about
that
but
your overall feeling
of how inappropriate trump was
will very much be modified
if we find one solid example
so trump is making a bet
that he has a good chance of losing
because maybe we won't find one precinct
with that problem
but
he's only one precinct away
from being the next president
nothing else could keep him out of the
office
i don't think i don't think there's
anything else that could keep him out of
office and because he's so far into it
at this point
january 6 etc he's so he's so far
invested he kind of has to ride this
horse all the way
if he suddenly changed opinion and said
you know i'll let this election go
his base would
rebel he would lose his base if he let
go of it so you know well let's let it
go we'll just play you know play another
day
he'd lose his base
so he wants to keep his base
and he's he's placed a
bet that they can find one
example he can sell he only needs one
if he can sell one
he's the next president
now
here's my question i'm asking you
is that point of view whether you agree
with it or not we're not talking about
whether you agree with it
is that the kind of tweet
that you would expect to see you get a
thousand retweets
am i wrong about that so just just check
my
uh viral
tweet assumption now remember threads
always get more
attention than tweets
so it's part of a thread factor that in
trump's stuff always gets more attention
than non-trump stuff factor that in
i'm known to say this kind of message so
when the tweeter is talking about their
own their topic of expertise
or something they're known for
they get more attention right when
monica lewinsky talks about bill clinton
she gets more retweets than if she talks
about purses
right so the
the the things which make a tweet get a
thousand retweets
i feel are all in this tweet thread
but it didn't
uh now again
since most of the theme of what i've
talked about today is don't make too
much from anecdotal evidence
aren't i judging whether this got shadow
banned based on anecdotal evidence
okay yes
yes i am that's why i'm asking instead
of stating
i just want to get a second opinion on
this just if you feel the same way about
it you know we won't be able to confirm
anything
um
should put down a rhino blacklist you
know i don't care about that rhino stuff
the the whole uh republican and name
only thing
i don't have any interest in that as a
as a way to frame things
things are either good ideas or they're
not
you know how you decide to
label yourself
or other people i don't care i'm going
to look at the topic
if the topic's good
i might support it
but i don't care if somebody is
re-labeling their friends oh you're a
rhino you're not a rhino
that does nothing for me
um
all right
let's see what else we got going on here
nothing
nothing at all
all right
uh yeah let's go brandon
all right am i missing any big stories
um us intelligence caught flat-footed
again by china in what context did the
us intelligence get flat-footed
china weapon
hypersonic weapon
oh is there some kind of
china has a hypersonic
missile
great
you know the one thing that i worried
the least about is china launching a
preemptive nuclear attack
there's probably nothing that i
think less about than china launching a
preemptive attack
because china's game is weight
they just wait
you know they can wait a few hundred
years and dominate the world
it looks like it's going that way
um never talk about oh yeah katie couric
so there's a story about katie couric
who
edited a ruth bader ginsburg interview
uh
to make
ruth bader ginsburg look better
what was the topic
ginsburg said oh voter registration
was it voter registration that she was
oh kneeling
yeah ruth bader ginsburg said something
that the kneelers
were kind of spitting in the face of the
country that you know made their family
successful
and then katie couric decided that that
would make ruth bader ginsburg look bad
so she took it out
now the reason i didn't comment on that
story is that the whole story is in the
story
usually i like to talk about things
where i i can add a reframe of it or a
different point of view or something
but the katy kirk story is all there
she edited a story
to create
what you might call fake news
but i mean it was misleading because she
edited it
and
that's the whole story
so if you want to see another example of
the media being
something you can't trust well there's
one for you
um is that unusual i don't know
yeah i can tell you that i've been
edited to look smarter
i told you i think i mentioned that the
the playboy interview
was one of the most professional
best interviews i've ever been involved
in they did a lot of fact checking etc
now the playboy interview
they do edit it to make you look good
but what i mean by that is
if you say a sentence that's kind of
clunky
they will re-edit your sentence as if
you spoke it perfectly the first time
now i don't mind that because what
they're doing is just clarifying what
you really said
they're just doing a better job of
saying that you said it so if they fix
your words and you know get rid of a
you know a verbal tech
you know
say for example
that i use the word like
so let's say they ask me the question i
go well like uh that's uh that's like
you know this or that
they might get rid of the word like
because it didn't add anything and it
just makes me look like an idiot when i
talk that way
but the content would be the same so
playboy was played it completely
straight on content
but they did make me look smarter
because they just took down my verbal
tanks
uh north korean army video
and that's just theater
uh
yeah the whole the fact that
buddha judge
is on a two month is it i guess it's a
maternity leave
at the time that we have the biggest
problem in the country with his
department
that's really a bad look
on one hand
i certainly
am happy that parents can take maternity
leave and stuff and paternity leave
but
parental leave let's call it let's be
less sexist
but
i feel like this should be an exception
i feel like that if that were me
i don't know if zoom calls with the
office is going to be good enough
but they do need to bond with the baby
that's important too i wouldn't minimize
that
um
the content the same and they made scott
look smarter yeah
i suppose that would be that that is
mildly fake news i would agree with you
it's mildly fake news
uh you were very impressed by his
mckinsey pedigree
i'm very impressed by his analytical
pedigree
meaning that he has the ability to look
at the numbers and figure stuff out
so that part i'm i'm still in favor of i
think is mckinsey pedigree is strong
but i don't believe i ever told you that
his mckinsey pedigree makes him a good
leader
because mckinsey isn't about leadership
they're more about
nerdistically looking at numbers and
strategy
um
he should have at least named his backup
well of course he's got a backup i'm
sure somebody's in charge
there's uh the varus database
i think we've talked about we we can't
trust the information and that's the
whole story
but certainly there's enough reporting
in there that it's a red flag
doesn't mean that the vaccines are
dangerous if you think the vares
database is telling you the vaccines are
dangerous you need to more do more
research about what the vares database
base is and is not
it is definitely not
telling you the vaccinations are
dangerous
it definitely is
raising a big flag that says
maybe you should look at this a little
bit closer it's definitely doing that
it's not confirming anything
um
is california moving forward with
nuclear reactors i doubt it only because
we're incompetent
politically
uh who's the baby's dad
i don't care
all right just looking at some of your
comments
scott let me record a drum intro for
your show your show okay
go ahead and record one and
send it to me somehow
um
but i have to play it myself ultimately
but if you if you have an idea for it
i'd love to hear
the glow face generation what's the glow
face the people on on
devices
how is boo today she's she's happy and
affectionate today
um
i'll send it on instagram that's perfect
by the way if you want to get a message
to me that i'm more likely to see
my twitter size is i don't know 600 and
some thousand followers
and
uh but my instagram i think is 17 000.
most of them are fake fake followers i
think
i think at least half of my instagram
followers
are a slightly overweight woman with
large breasts who has posted one picture
and says hey
hey
i've got i've got scads of those i think
at least a thousand of my 17 000
followers are random woman with one
photo going
hey
hey
do you get those two
obviously they're not real people i
assume they're just guys
generation z is the glow face i think
low face refers to your phone lighting
up your face right
could it mean something else
i think that's all it means
um
are you on facebook yeah but i i don't
read all my messages on facebook
and i don't accept friends on my
personal account
how many of you are watching this on the
toilet right now
we're being asked anybody
how many are on the toilet right now
anybody like right now
who's on the toilet right now
well at least some of you were for part
of it all right i think that's a good
way to end this show possibly the best
thing that'll ever happen to you today
some of us get embarrassed easier than
you
[Laughter]
and rick says i'm on the couch but i
gotta pee that counts
that counts right
um
quasi bully tiffany dover i don't know
who she is
wow some doctors out there in canada say
they will lose their license if they say
anything negative about vaccines geez
sheesh
oh good scott o'belt
i hope things work out for you
um
all right delta yeah delta decided to
not mandate
vaccination smart move
i think smart
move well thank you
please try to stop cussing again
you know it's a continuous struggle
sidebar with fifa oh i am going to do uh
fifa and barnes i think it's is it this
week
so i did agree to do viva vivian barnes
um
you've had better tweets yeah i'm sure i
have
um okay
so
so the clanking is uh
so sticks and hammer clanks his coffee
with his spoon
well i don't use
anything in my coffee
so i don't need a spoon
i take my coffee
black
are you saying that i interact more on
twitter than on locals actually that's
not true i interact with more people
on locals some more individual comments
i interact with but on twitter i just
get more engagement because there are
more people
and i probably tweet more i probably
tweet obviously i tweet more
but um but i interact with more
individuals on locals actually
at least i try to
um
desantis and tulsi how come no one
mentions tulsi well
we're not in a
political race yet
if she were we would
all right that's all for now i will talk
to you tomorrow
how do you avoid coffee stains in your
teeth
well
full disclosure
my teeth are
not real
so these are um
what do you call it they're not real
they're uh
uh they they cover my real teeth
yeah they're porcelain they're veneers
i'm sorry that's the word the veneers so
i don't know if the veneers have the
same risk of
of stain
yeah they're veneers so with the veneer
your real teeth are underneath but
they've been ground down so you you'll
you'll never be able to use your real
teeth because they're ground down to fit
the veneer over it
and that's that's your answer
bye for now
