good morning everybody and welcome
to another spectacular live stream
possibly the highlight of your entire
life
so far
tomorrow's looking good too if you'd
like to take it up another level
and yeah it's possible i know it doesn't
seem possible
but it is
am i having an audio problem no i'm good
on audio all you need to take it up
another level is a copper bug or a glass
of tanker chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
being here today the thing that makes
everything better
it's called
the simultaneous sip it happens now
go
yeah
yeah yeah yeah so here's another sign of
the golden age
i'm going to make the following
pronouncement
nobody is offended by anything anymore
you probably didn't notice
kind of snuck up on you
and you think it's true right you you
think it's not true you think that
people are offended all the time by
language and insults
nope
what has happened is people are pretty
sure that other people are could be
offended and they're defending those
people
but we ran out of people who were
offended
i don't even know the last time i heard
about anybody being offended personally
now when people say they're offended
really it's just
language
they're just saying oh
i'm offended that you called me bold
well not really
i get called bald fairly often and i
can't remember the last time i felt
offended
you know maybe i didn't like it
maybe it's not the message i wanted to
take forward about myself but
offend it i don't know
it just feels like it's an opinion
happening in somebody else's skull
can anybody remember the last time you
were offended
sometimes you just don't like what
people are saying but offended
uh you just think there's something
wrong with the person who said it right
so i i just think we should recognize
that we're no longer in a world where
people are offended
we're just pretty sure other people are
do you know what do you know what it
means when you think somebody else is
offended
think about it
think about it when it meet what it
means
for the people who the people who say
that well i'm not offended
but on behalf of those other people i'm
going to defend them what's that really
saying
it's really kind of offensive isn't it
it's kind of offensive
that somebody thinks they need to
defend me for example or you or somebody
else
why is somebody else telling me that i'm
so weak that i'm going to be offended
right
if you're offended by language
you're kind of weak
now if the language has a real world
impact on you and you're complaining
about that yeah by all means it has a
real world impact
but if if i'm protecting you because i
think you're going to be offended i kind
of think you're weak don't i
i'm not sure that i want that
well here's some fake news it was uh it
wasn't on the real news but it was on
the social media
but it's fake that elon musk was
considering building a private airport
in texas there near where he lives but
elon responded that by saying that he
lives five minutes from the austin
airport who would be dumb to build his
own airport
kind of would be
because
if you have a private jet
it just sits there at the public airport
until you're ready to use it
now you do have to compete for
a runway he said that they could use
another runway so probably there are
times when he has to wait
20 minutes to fly or something
i don't think it's a big deal if you're
five minutes from an airport you have a
private jet that's just sitting there
you just got to wait your turn to use
the runway right
i can't imagine that he'd need to build
his own airport for
in that situation
seems like it'd be a waste so i believe
in what he says that's fake news
um
so as i've told you stefan collinson is
the person who writes
opinion pieces for cnn when there's uh
really no substance to write about but
you still have to say something bad
about republicans or trump
he'll he'll jump into the breach and
find something there
uh and here's how the start of his
opinion piece on cnn starts today quote
liz cheney has posed the question
with
with which america
may have to wrestle for months to come
here's the question
if
if
there is evidence that ex-president
donald trump committed crimes in seeking
to overturn the 2020 election
what message will send if he's not
charged
stephen coulson wants you to know that's
a big question we should wrestle with
yeah i'm going to stop thinking about
war with china
supply chain inflation
let me let me think about
the hypothetical
that the committee that has been
investigating for however long
has so far found absolutely nothing that
looks even slightly like a crime
but if they did
in the imaginary world
if we could find a hypothetical
imaginary world in which trump did
commit a crime in the imaginary world
well the america would have to wrestle
with it in that imaginary world
do you see where we're at
we're at a point where he has to propose
speculative hypothetical crimes because
the january 6 committee didn't find
anything
do you think that that collinson would
would simply
say that if there was any evidence
if any evidence had been presented
if any evidence existed already
do you think the january 6 committee
would have said you know
we're going to save the good stuff for
last
would they do that
do you think we'd get to this point and
have no evidence they even
remember this is not me saying there's
no evidence that wouldn't mean anything
to you
this is his biggest critic
essentially admitting with his
hypothetical question i think that's how
you'd have to interpret it he's
admitting that there's no evidence
of trump committing a crime
they've actually turned a complete lack
of evidence
into a hypothetical crime
all right here's another one
hypothetically
if stephen collinson had
murdered a prostitute
how would you feel if no charges were
filed
i feel bad about that i don't know about
you
but as stephen collinson has ever
there's no evidence he's ever done this
by the way i don't want to suggest
there's any evidence he ever has or
would
murder a prostitute
but if he did if he did i think we all
have to wrestle with the question of
what would happen if he didn't get
charged
what would happen
that's all they have
there's a
great piece by joel in breitbart
today
in which he's noted that there's a lot
of stuff moving in the right direction
in this country
what could be a better endorsement that
things are moving in the right direction
than the biggest issue
ah there's nothing there
our big our biggest issue is that
so-called insurrection that turns out
not to be an insurrection and it wasn't
an insurrection it was just
people getting a little worked up over
something that was bad but not as bad as
they say
all right
alex jones apparently lost his uh
case there in court
so he's got to pay 4.1 million to the
parents of the san diego parents
now let's check the fake news on this
is cnn reported today that uh
jones has made
you know
dozens of millions or hundreds of
millions of dollars
they say peddling his conspiracy
theories
and so 4.1 million would be
a drop in the bucket because according
to them at one point he was making over
800 000 a day
in 2018.
now let's compare that cnn reporting
that he has
tons and tons of money
to the fact that he's declared
bankruptcy
which doesn't mean he's out of money
that just means he might need time to
generate the cash to pay any debts
with the fact that i asked my digital
assistant
what uh alex jones's net worth is
and is pretty close to the 4.1 million
they the you know
amazon
says 5 million if you use their digital
system
now what do you think
do you think alex jones's net worth is
closer to 5 million in which cases 4
million
would
take him down you know quite a bit
uh 80 percent
is he already being charged 80 of his
entire net worth or does he have tons
and tons of millions left over
you have no idea
no idea
but uh alex jones has said that it was a
mistake
he's he doesn't believe what he said
about the sandy hook thing being fake
and he apologized unreservably in my
opinion it was just a direct apology for
mistake
now he does claim that he didn't know he
was wrong
what do you think
do you think alex jones knew it wasn't
true
or do you think he thought it was true
when he was reporting it
what do you think
i actually don't know
i don't know
i really don't know
because there are plenty of people who
are educated and well informed who
believe
ridiculous conspiracy theories
look how many people believe that
president trump said
that
you should maybe think about drinking
bleach
a lot of
well-educated well-informed people
literally believe that like actually
believe it
so if you tell me that alex jones who
appears to be
you know a capable communicator somebody
who's built a big entity that you know
made a lot of money apparently
so how can he be so capable
and yet believe something that would
that's so ridiculously untrue in your
opinion
but you just have to look around
almost everybody that you know is
believing something just as ridiculous
but sometimes you don't notice because
you believe it too
right if you believe it's true too you
don't notice other people believing
ridiculous things all the time
so is it possible i mean i can't read
his mind i don't i don't know what he
believed i really don't but i would say
this is a genuine mystery in my opinion
i think it's a genuine mystery what he
really believed
i have no way of knowing
well china suspended some
diplomacy and some
you know various things that we were
dealing with them
in international relations
and i guess that's real
they're trying to be tough and
respond to nancy pelosi going to taiwan
and
i feel like nothing good came out of
this
am i am i wrong
on one hand you want to protect the
right of any american especially
high-ranking american politician
to travel wherever they want
to an allied country
so on one hand it's just you know
preserving her
i guess right to do so
but
nothing good came of it it just made
china more angry and they're going to
stop talking to us about some things
that might matter
so i don't know it looks like a
loss
yeah it looks like we didn't gain
anything at all
on the other hand if china is going to
be a dick and stop talking to us about
anything productive i think we can go in
and kill their fence and all dealers in
country
now i know it's really hard to get cia
assets into china it's probably pretty
hard
but if we can i think we should just
take out their fentanyl dealers just
murder them where they are as terrorists
i think we could deter
in fact i think we could declare china a
terrorist state as long as they're
sending us fentanyl
we should talk about it
why would we consider
saying that
the cartels are terrorists if we're not
considering the people who send them
their weapons part of the terrorist
organization in this case weapons being
the fentanyl
so i think we should deter declare
the fentanyl production facilities and
anything that helps them
maybe including the government if the
government is helping them i don't know
if they are
just declare them terrorists and then
declare our intention to kill them
we should also start sending home
chinese born or chinese resident
students that are in the united states
just kick out 10 a week 10 a day
whatever it takes until they're all gone
so
uh if we're going to be that way let's
be that way looks like maybe we are
going to be that way
new cold war which i know
so here's a story that i keep seeing on
the internet but i believe there is
nothing to it
how many of you believe the following
thing to be true
and i'm telling you advance in advance i
see no evidence to to say this is true
i believe this is completely made up
but i've seen it a number of times on
twitter so i'll tell you what it is you
tell me if you think this is true
do you think that all cause mortality is
way up
meaning
people who are not elderly are dying
from things that they weren't dying from
two years ago
that the baseline of just ordinary
non-non-covariate related as far as you
know non-covalent related deaths are way
up for basically everything
do you think that's true
because you've seen things on twitter
that say it's true right
but try googling it
you can't google it there's no news
story that supports it
if you can find any credible source
please tweet it at me because i didn't
see any and i looked i looked for it i
don't
the only place you can find it though is
on sketchy sources on twitter
now i know you're saying the ethical
skeptic
some of you would say he's not a sketchy
source but i don't know who he is
and i've seen a lot of stuff out of him
that i don't understand
meaning he prints a lot of stuff that i
look at and i go i don't i don't know
where the data come from where it came
from or how to interpret it
you're lying
what am i lying about somebody's
accusing me of lying
lie
why would i lie about any of this
what would even be the point of it i
hope you're not talking to me
uh
i need at least an incentive to lie what
would be my reason
i can't even think of one
anyway
i looked around and i could not deduce
that was true i did see a video
of somebody who claimed to be a
insurance company ceo
making the claim that there's there's no
other explanation
except that
the vaccinations must have caused some
autoimmune
problem that makes every other kind of
disease seem worse for a while
except the name of that insurance
company wasn't even in the video
right
i mean are you going to believe somebody
who says their insurance company
executive and they don't name the
company
and what about the other executives do
they say the same thing is there anybody
who's actually associated with an actual
company that i've heard of
that would say all cause mortality is up
and we don't know why
and secondly
we really don't know why
if you just made everybody fatter and
more sedentary
and then made them worry more wouldn't
they die of everything more often
am i wrong
i mean i'm no doctor
but just take the baseline health of
people and don't change anything except
you make them way fatter
exercise way less
and i'm going to throw in another one
spend two years avoiding germs
what's that do to your immune system
spend two years avoiding germs pretty
well
let's say you successfully avoided germs
because i didn't get
you know during the covid lockdown
i didn't get any other illness did you
did anybody catch a common cold during
the pandemic i didn't
did anybody catch a common cold
i i feel like we have an entire
civilization
that just took its own immune response
down by avoiding
germs for two years
so
uh
so we're getting fat we were more
sedentary we had more to worry about
uh we didn't have the same social
benefits we had we have more fentanyl
there's more crime
uh and we've probably avoided germs
maybe too much for two years it might
have weakened our ability to fight the
next group that come along i'm saying
germs as you know a general word for
i'm just saying germs is the general
word for anything that
affects your autoimmune system or your
immune system
so
i'm going to call bs
on this until somebody gives me a real
source
all right here is this little
sir croth
scott adams the most desperate pro
vaxxer on the internet
first of all i'm not provax
second of all you're uninformed
thirdly you're defaming me like
like
a so stop doing it
and thirdly
or fourthly you're gone
boom
all right
you
you have to get a little bit higher
level of interaction than
you're coping
you're coping
no i'm not coping
god damn
 idiots
all right let's get back to some
positivity
um
so a question asked of uh
kirby in the government in the biden
administration
he was asked by fbn's uh ed edward
lawrence this is the question it's a
good question
given the aggression we're seeing
from china and the fbi director saying
that china is the number one threat to
the u.s in the next 10 years
would biden caution companies from
expanding in china
that's a good question isn't it
if the biden administration is saying
china is our biggest
threat wouldn't the binding
administration also be
responsibly acting to caution companies
not to expand business
and the answer was that private
companies make their own decisions
since when
since when do private companies make
their own decisions
how about this uh new tax plan that
the congress is
is uh
looks like they'll probably pass
they would raise the minimum tax on
corporations was that the corporations
deciding to pay more taxes or was that
the government telling companies what to
do
pay more taxes
i mean
since when does the government not tell
companies what to do it's the very thing
they do all the time so that's a dumb
answer
and it's an avoiding answer
if
if we think that china is our number one
threat
our government should be warning us
against it in fact i would say that
would be pretty basic to their
essential mission
i would say the government's central
mission
is to find out what's happening in the
rest of the world and warn us about it
and tell us where to do business and
where not to do business that's exactly
what they should be doing
i want more of that not less
totally now if they told me not to do
business in a place that didn't have any
reason not to do business
then i would say oh
well that's inappropriate i want to do
business with this country you don't
have any good reasons don't tell me not
to do it
but if they know
that the united states is likely to
continue pressuring china and vice versa
if we know that
don't you think a little bit of heads up
to our corporations isn't is appropriate
a little bit heads up
you know and the question was not
will the government make it illegal to
expand in china that wasn't the question
if the question had been
should the government make it illegal to
expand
then i think you know the the answer
we're going to let corporations decide
would be appropriate
but
but i think at least a warning would be
fair
um and what do you think about this
question of whether private companies
will make their own decisions
let's say the government doesn't get
involved
is it still true that private companies
make their own decisions
i would add a caveat to that
private companies or yeah private
companies do make their own decisions
as long as i'm not interested
if i'm interested
and i am in in the case of china then
they're not going to make their own
decisions
i'm i'm going to make china so toxic
that they can't decide to work there
so you have to ask yourself
what is free will and what's their own
decisions there's there's some gray area
here
because i do think that i can pollute
china enough
in terms of people's opinion about how
smart it would be to
do business there
i i do have the platform
i have a big enough platform and because
i i'm the dilbert guy
i have enough of a track record of
telling businesses what they can't do
i've been doing it for years
for
probably 30 years now
i've been telling corporations what they
can't do
and then they stop doing it
do you know how many companies have told
me that they stopped a policy because
they saw it getting mocked in a dilbert
comic a lot
a lot
it's not it's not a random you know rare
thing a lot
the entire
business management business book market
fell apart
when i started market mocking it i don't
know if there's anything in business
anymore that i've mocked that has
survived
i mean even dress codes
dress codes have largely gone away i
mean i was mocking those in the 90s
you know cubicles started to go away i
mean pretty much anything i mock
ends up
you know being at risk so no
the companies do not have their own say
about china i will make it so difficult
to do business in china because of the
risk it's a real risk by the way i'm
doing you a
patriotic positive thing here so there's
there's no negativity to this
i will make it
impossible
what about esg
the only reason the esg still exists in
business is that i haven't taken it on
yet
but when i do
i'll give it six months and that's gonna
get really embarrassing
now dilbert doesn't have the same clout
it used to have right in the 90s i could
i could pretty much take something out
in a week
right now it would take a little while
but mockery is a really powerful force
in the corporate world no ceo wants to
be
on the receiving end of mockery
it's really terrible
now somebody i was waiting for this
comment
what took you so long
somebody at youtube said i'm drunk with
power
i was looking for a little more pushback
i was looking for somebody to say scott
you're you're dreaming you can't
actually
cause
corporations to yeah i can i actually
can
cause corporations to act differently
that that is absolutely demonstrated in
my in my history
and there's no reason to believe it
wouldn't continue happening
so i'll only use my powers for good
um speaking of power
ron desantis
uh has suspended a tampa state attorney
for being too woke i guess the attorney
wasn't going to
act on the state's new abortion
restrictions
and desantis suspended him without pay
for basically just not doing his job
what is the point of hiring a state
attorney who doesn't believe the the
laws of the of his own state
no matter what you think about the
abortion laws no matter what you think
about
social justice and wokeness no matter
what you think about any of that
if if a person gets hired to do a job
and then says i'm not going to do it
i don't think there's any question about
whether they have to go
i i love this
all
right um
the other thing we learned is that
desantis claims that he was not aware
that his staff
turned down the invitation to be on the
view
now i think he agreed with their
decision
but
what kind of staff turns that down
without talking to the boss
do you believe that
do you believe that desantis's staff
turned down an invitation to the view
in in very news making language without
checking with it
it's possible
it's possible
because you know bureaucracy isn't big
companies and blah blah it's possible
there's something but i would probably
fire that staff
no no no no no somebody's saying that's
a smart staff no no no you have to fire
them
he should fire them
because they made a decision that was
his decision and that wasn't theirs to
make
because he may have played it
differently
right
i
he may have he may have said you know
this is one this is one time that i
might want to go into the
belly of the lion i'm strong enough now
that i can survive that i'm
you know i'm quick enough that i can
make this work
i i think they took that option away
from their boss and they should be fired
for that
like if if somebody did that to me i'd
at least demote them
whoever made the decision can you
imagine having would you put up with the
risk of that happening again
if your employee made that decision for
you
and presented it as your decision and
did it flamboyantly
it's the flamboyant part that's
that's cause for termination
yeah if you do if you make a decision on
my behalf
flamboyantly without checking on me oh
you're so fired
you're so fired
how many people who have ever managed
employees would agree with me
that that's a firing offense
i want to see if anybody agrees
now you you'd have to take the entire
situation into effect so i'm
oversimplifying it it's not the only
variable in play
but if it were the only variable in play
that's a firing offense yeah i guess
some of you agree with me
so i think we could we can all uh
there's no inconsistency you can like
desantis and still say maybe that was a
staffing problem
you know it's not like there's anybody
at his level who doesn't have staffing
problems
you know i mean i i say the same thing
about cuomo
yeah i think cuomo took a lot of heat
for maybe a staff mistake about the
nursing homes i get he may be he's the
one who signed off on it blah blah but
he was advised
you know somebody presented him the
option
i just think everybody has staffing
problems i'm not sure exactly how much
you can
assume is the top boss's actual problem
or or they caused it
so
here's a question that i want all of you
to start asking your democrat friends
just for fun just for fun
um
the question is
if you could rig the 20 if you believed
let's put it in i'll just paraphrasement
if you believed
a racist were coming into office for the
presidency
and you believe this was definitely a
terrible
racist
and you had the option of rigging the
election let's say you're in a position
to do so if you had the option of
ringing the election to keep an unknown
racist out of office
would you do it
and if you say no that you wouldn't do
it
what the hell is wrong with you
are you a coward or are you
not a patriot
because i would
let me say it as clearly as possible
if there was somebody running for
president who was a confirmed known
racist
or i believed it to be true
i mean i could be wrong but let's say i
believed it to be true because i'd
accepted what the news told me
if i believed it to be true and i was in
a position
to stop that person from coming to
office
pretty sure i'd do it
especially if i thought i had a chance
of getting away with it right now
you know we all like to think that we
would have shot hitler if we had a
chance but you know people aren't that
brave really i feel like if i could get
away with it
and i could stop a racist from coming to
office
i feel like that would be the patriotic
thing to do
i remind you
that we are a nation of laws
created by the biggest law breakers the
world has ever known
so do you do what they say or what they
did because the founders were the
biggest law breakers
a
revolution a revolution's about as hard
as you can break the law
you can't break the law any harder than
that
we were created by law breakers
that's our dna
and our dna says completely clearly
correct me if i'm wrong
if you're an american
re read your own dna
doesn't your dna say
follow the law totally follow the law
unless
things go too far
and then break the law
right
nobody says that directly
but it's in your dna
everybody follow the law unless there's
some like weird situation that just has
gone too far and then
you pick up your rifle if you need to
you break the law you cheat
you do what you need to do
like you're not you're not protected
from the obligation to protect your
country
because there's some legal
legal way that the other team is doing
it
your obligation to your
family your country
doesn't go away
in a real emergency that doesn't go away
because there's some law in the way
no the law is the least important thing
if you have a genuine emergency the
genuine emergency says do what makes
sense
it doesn't
a genuine emergency doesn't say
do what is legal
it's the opposite a genuine emergency
says always do what makes sense
period
no
you never get out of that side of that
double or you're in trouble
so
i feel like that's a fair question to
democrats
if they didn't cheat in 2022 under the
their belief
that trump was you know literally some
kind of a racist white supremacist
dictator monster if they didn't cheat
they need to explain that
and if they're not willing to cheat in
2024 they need to explain that why
they're not on the side of the country
right now they might be
mistaken in their beliefs i believe they
are
but they're not acting on their beliefs
in a way that you would even imagine
could be slightly patriotic
slightly positive even slightly
worthy of praise
there's a real character problem if
they're not willing to act on their
beliefs
or maybe it's telling us those are not
real beliefs right
i've said this before
if you're standing in the middle of the
street and you see a truck coming at you
and it doesn't look like it's going to
stop
and you don't get out of the way
that's somebody who doesn't believe
there's a truck because they didn't get
out of the way
but if you get out of the way
well
that means you believe the truck was
there
right so if you're not acting on the
thing you you believe on there's
something going on
so if they said
trump was a big old racist dictator who
was going to destroy the world
they say that very clearly and often
if they were not willing to act on it
what's wrong with their character and i
think you could be asking that directly
isn't your character
defective like why don't you do
something about that
so the the analogy
um let me teach you how to use analogies
an analogy
should tell you exactly one point
is not trying to be the same as the
subject you're talking about
the one point from my analogy is that
people will act on what they think is
true
will you accept that somebody standing
in front of a moving truck
will act based on what they believe is
true is that really a truck coming at me
don't tell me the analogy is
wrong if you don't know how to
understand an analogy there's just one
minor
thin little thing that an analogy tries
to do
and if you go beyond that and say
well
those are not exactly the same thing
well then
you should not be in this conversation
at all
now
if i may criticize myself
why am i using an analogy when i know
they don't work because there are too
many people too dumb to
to process them
case in point somebody who's too dumb to
process an analogy i keep making the
i keep making the
assumption
that my
yeah my audience is smarter you can
handle that
but some people sneak in on youtube who
don't understand how analogies work oh
your analogy is not exactly the same
thing as the thing you're at uh you're
comparing it to
um
if it were the same thing
then there wouldn't be any point
let me give you an analogy the way this
gentleman would like you to see
them i'd like to
talk about this
this little power pack is a little bit
extra battery i'd like to make an
analogy
by comparing this to it this identical
one
because that's a good analogy so we'll
compare this to this identical one and
everything i say about this one will be
true of this one
what is the point
right no
the analogies are supposed to be
different
all right if you don't get that part
you should find a less challenging
podcast
all right
rasmussen tells us that the midterms are
narrowing just like everybody told you
would happen
did i tell you that the
by the time election day comes along
that the polling that said at one point
republicans had a
nine point
advantage of a generic republican
against a generic democrat in the
midterms
nine points
and then for a while it hung around
eight
and dropped a five but five is still
pretty big
and now it's down to three
so we went from nine to three
um
uh
i'll get rid of you for just being a
jerk
goodbye
all right
so
why is it
that
it's narrowing
why is it that i knew it would narrow
that the lead would narrow and then it
did
why is that
that's an honest question
why
why was it such a big gap and now it's
narrowing
is it the media
because it seems to me the uh the
january 6th thing fell apart
the january 6 thing showed apparently no
crime for trump and no insurrection
uh planning so
so he has a free path to the white house
you would think that all of these things
would make
biden less popular
here's what i think it is there was a
rob reiner tweet that said
provocatively
that
biden has accomplished more in his term
so far
than any president in 60 years
and i read that and i thought
actually you know i think it's a little
hyperbolic
but it's directionally probably true
if you look at the legislation
that biden has done if you look at the
impact he's had on things and
um i would say he's accomplished a lot
for his base or he's on he's on the cusp
of doing so assuming his latest
legislation gets through if you were to
just look at his legislation
it looks like
he will have his name on some pretty big
pieces of legislation
right
now don't don't confuse accomplishment
for things you want
i'm saying things his base wants
i i feel like he has
moved the bar
on some things that his base wants
so we've got gas prices coming down at
the moment
that should make a difference in the
vote
we've got
inflation is bad
and
but we also might get used to it
it's weird but you can get used to
something that just sort of lays there
in the baseline and i worry that
although inflation may stay high
if it starts drifting down all before
the midterms
that will be enough
if inflation will say inflation is you
know 9.5
um today whatever it is it's in that
range
now let's say that drifts down to six
percent
still way too much right but let's say
it drifts down to six percent before
election day it's going to take all the
energy out of it
because you're going to think to
yourself well it looks like it's under
control
and it could easily drift down a little
bit it wouldn't take much it just has to
directionally look like it's going down
so i think that
biden's got legislative successes at
least the news will report it that way
ukraine seems to be a stalemate so we
just stopped thinking about it
his disastrous withdrawal from
afghanistan
happened so early in the term that we're
already forgetting about it
employment looks pretty good
employment looks pretty good
and he's starting to do some trump-like
things like build a little bit of the
wall
and maybe promoting the abrahamic chords
that he had been a little negative on
so if you take the fact that he's first
of all triangulating
in other words he's he's quite
consciously it seems
accepting some
points of view that are a little bit
republican that i just mentioned
so
um
i would say that it's all of those
things i would say that basically he's
just sort of
getting
everything trending in the right
direction
probably by luck
probably by luck but i feel it too i was
saying it the other day in my opinion
our country's moving in the right
direction we're decoupling from china
that seems real
i think nuclear is now getting the
attention it deserves i think that we're
starting to look at all of our energy
sources a little bit closer to you know
not crippling
one to benefit the other that looks good
we have more people being covered by
health care
if you don't mind the expense of that
that looks good
i don't know i see a lot of things
moving in the right direction
and i feel like that's probably the
reason
that the reason that his poll numbers
are improving
is that i feel like other people feel
too
now you might say but what about nancy
pelosi and
in taiwan i feel like that's popular
right it might in fact
you know increase our risk with china
but i feel like it's popular in the
united states is it not is it not
popular
so
stop watching cnn
i watch both i watch the left and the
right if you're not watching the left
and the right
um
all right
so we're all getting used to being
screwed no
no i'm not saying it at all
you know the
inflation's a real problem and i don't
have a solution for that nor does
anybody else
um
stop watching msnbc you know everybody
who's telling me to stop looking at the
news on the other side
does that feel like good advice
it's literally the basis of the show as
i'm looking at the news on both sides
and trying to tell you when being on a
team is less smart than looking at the
issue
like it's exactly what i'm trying to do
is look at both sides no i'm not going
to stop doing that
if i didn't look who would
so you think it's pollster corruption i
disagree
because
there are too many polls
that are looking to
watch this if you see rasmussen and also
a lot of polls that are clearly
left-leaning
start to agree that the
gap is narrowing i wouldn't worry about
pollster corruption in that situation
but if you saw rasmussen saying there
was a a nine point gap
when the the sketchier pollsters started
saying there was no gap
well i'd worry about that
but i think you're going to see all of
them moving you know a few points above
apart
but moving toward the the same answer i
think
um yeah let's talk about
brittany griner so
we've got this mass american basketball
player
who had some weed and in russia that's a
pretty bad bad defense she got nine
years
for some weed
and she wasn't selling it she was using
it for her own purposes
now obviously
i say obviously
i can't confirm it but to me it's
obvious that putin is using this as a
negotiating
uh thing
and
if it looks like that's what's happening
given that we've offered some i think
we've offered an arms dealer or
something in return
i feel like we should just you know
grab some russian that they care about
and just trade them back i mean if it's
literally going to be a hostage
situation
well let's just take a hostage
you know they did
yeah if russia takes a hostage we can
take hostage i mean we would need some
you know reason for why we're
doing it
you know lavrov would be top of my list
i know you can't arrest a diplomat
or can you
um scott do you like golf
i hope that's a joke
but how how hard do you think we should
go on russia to release brittany griner
now she she knew what was illegal
she probably didn't know it was a
nine-year thing
uh i wouldn't have done that i mean i
wouldn't have imagined it would really
happen it's hard to imagine it like your
head has a hard time holding that as a
possibility but
it was real
how hard should we go
so some are saying no that's her own
problem right
no
while i would agree with you that she
made her own bed
and when people create their own
problems they have to
they have to answer for it
however that's not really the context
here
the context here is that putin just took
an american hostage
that's not good
if putin takes an american hostage we
have to respond in kind
i don't know what that looks like but
we're going to need to take somebody
hostage that we don't already have to
trade them back
so
um
[Music]
i'd say take a hostage
they did
all right um
so jobs looks good
employee employment is up added half a
million jobs we you know we thought it
would be half as many as that
um
unemployment still looks not bad
um
who thinks is a good idea to take drugs
into a foreign country well i'm not
going to excuse brittany greiner's
mistake
i'll just point out that she is
a young person and she is american
and
she didn't get arrested because of her
drugs
right i mean maybe that was the reason
she got arrested i guess but i don't
think the nine the nine year
thing is political
and i think we have to treat it that way
i think it's just an act of war
i realize is compatible with their laws
but it's obvious in this this context
it's obvious it's just an act of war
what would trump do in this situation
because i feel like biden is just being
kind of quiet about it maybe quiet
diplomacy
what would he do
you think trump would do nothing
i don't know
i think trump likes saving celebrities
i think for trump saving a
saving a black woman
would be too irresistible
i think trump would be he would throw
everything on it
am i wrong
do it do i not know trump or something
you you don't think
you don't think trump would throw
everything at this
because it would look so good
yeah it would be counter to his
narrative it would be
pro-american it would be right on right
on message
in fact if you want her to be released i
think trump's your best shot
yeah
i i think he i think all it takes is
making it a priority
i'm not sure there's much more nuance to
it than that
i i think if trump just said hold on
stop everything
just stop everything
if you don't give her back
yeah we're going to send you know
ukraine
you'd never want them to have or
something like that
something like that
all right
uh he's already working on it you think
maybe he is
maybe trump is already working on it but
i don't think china wants trump to
succeed so
uh they're not going to do it when he's
out of office that's for sure
i don't think so
why didn't trump legalize marijuana
i don't know
but my only assumption is that he's just
so anti-drug that
he just can't get there
that's my guess
but i don't know i don't it's just pure
speculation because i can't read his
mind but there's no um i don't believe
there's any argument he's ever made
i'm not i've never heard him make an
argument one way or the other about
legalizing marijuana
yeah i think he just doesn't like any of
that business period
and
you know while i disagree with him on
that point
uh it's not a it's not a terrible
position to take but i think it would be
consistent with republicans to at least
get the federal government out of that
business
so why he didn't do that
i think would just be a mistake
how about that
it can can i just say that's just a
clean mistake
on trump's part to not at least make
some motion to legalize it because he
always had the cover that it's up to the
states and that would be the most
consistent thing any republican ever
said
so
uh there are several topics which i
would say
trump failed completely at
he failed completely of fentanyl
completely
right there's no i can't give him any
i thought he took a run at it but he
failed right i'll give him credit for
taking a run at it
uh
i think he failed on health care
i think he failed on prescription drugs
um
i think he
he didn't get the wall built
you know you could say that was his
failure that was congress maybe
um
yeah
i i would say there's all kinds of
things that he just unambiguously failed
at
but
compared to the alternative yeah what
was the other candidate going to succeed
at all that
i don't know
maybe
um
scott is messing with your hesitant well
i'm not trying to do that right now
uh completely disagree with marijuana
well it's up to congress to change the
laws correct
but the leader of the united states
should be weighing in
and if trump had said
i will sign it if you send it to me
i would have loved to hear that
but it didn't happen
all right
uh i have standards when it comes to
trump but none for
joe
what the are you talking about
how did you watch this podcast and say
that i have standards for trump and not
for biden
because i've never criticized biden
biden hasn't fixed the border he messed
up energy
have you missed me criticizing biden
are you kidding
really
you're what you're a member of the
locals
subscription service which means you
have enough interest in my content
that you subscribe to it
and you've never heard me criticize
biden
i just gave biden a long list of kudos
did i i just said he did things for his
side
are you disagreeing with the factual
statement
because the people on his side are
saying thank you for that we like this
bill we're going to vote for it
right
oh man you guys got to grow up
you got to grow up so somebody on
youtube is saying i'm sounding
pro-binding you know you're too
dumb to be on this podcast
uh you're sounding pro-biden today all
right i'm gonna delete you
honestly if you think this is pro-biden
you're too dumb to be with us
let's just increase the iq get rid of
those people
anybody else does anybody else think
they're saying the good and the bad of
both people is taking sides
is anybody so stupid
that they think showing the pros and
cons of something is taking aside
anybody
because i'd like to get rid of some more
idiots
i really don't want to be talking to
people who are too dumb to understand
that
right if you can't understand that
you are too dumb to be here
just go watch
i won't name names
[Laughter]
i was just going to name names but i
don't think i will
because i'm at it i'm adding
some of you i'm not mad at them right
now
yes in all capitals i
so 2 wall street says in all capitals
you did say things are going in the
right direction
yes
because that's what the data says
all right so i'm gonna
hide you from this channel
all right anybody else
do
if you'd like to prove
all right here's another all the i'm
looking at all the ones in all caps the
ones that all caps are the good ones
dwayne kate says when scott i have to i
have to yell yell talk it because this
is not all caps when scott talks ukraine
it makes me enraged but i'm respectable
of alternative opinions why did you put
that in caps
okay that one's that one's acceptable
all right so so that's acceptable
even with the capital letters i'm gonna
let that go
because he's angry at what i'm saying
but he's at least
accepting that an alternative opinion
might have some value okay very good
for a moment there i was going to go off
on you but that was
you pulled me back from the edge
carl
carl writes in all caps
here's a sentence in all caps
carl
carl
um i don't care about the brianna taylor
cops isn't there a story about the
brianna taylor
the cops who were
killed her
falsified some
paperwork
if they did then they need to pay for
that
i mean i i don't generally like to spend
too much time on the individual crime
stories
i feel like there's not enough there and
the news handles that
all right
um
put a cap in it
butter your bacon i'm being told all
right
um
what about loud noises
all right some of you some of you i
think come just for the blocking
is it my imagination or the top three
spokespeople for the biden
administration incapable of speaking
at least coherently
their current spokesperson uh
karine jean pierre
is she one of the worst that we've seen
i think she's one of the worst just in
terms of communication skills i think
she's one of the worst biden is terrible
and then kamal harris is a nightmare but
have we ever seen
the three top
speakers for the
administration having no communication
skills whatsoever let me just be
terrible at it
uh christopher ray and cruz is tom
cruise going after the fbi
all right is there any stories i missed
here
um
who's really running things yes we do
wonder
do i let trolls troll me
sometimes the trolls are just energy
sometimes i feed on them
my mascots i call them
stocks are down
yeah
oh yeah kerry care lake was a confirmed
winner in arizona can somebody
explain to me why they thought that the
kerry lake primary might be rigged
why would they think that one was rigged
the the thinking was that the democrats
would cleverly try to get the less
qualified
republican elected
i don't know
do they bother rigging that when they
could just rig the ultimate thing
if they were going to rig which i'm not
alleging
um tesla's gonna split three to one yeah
all right
um
yes blake masters looks like he has a
good shot for the senate
do you think democracy has been
redefined to me in bureaucracy
[Music]
yeah i don't think so
although i can see your point though
yeah it's a little too conceptual i
think
all right
um
well that's all that's all i got
so i think we're gonna make sure today
and go do some work
and uh
i will talk to all of you
later bye for now youtube
