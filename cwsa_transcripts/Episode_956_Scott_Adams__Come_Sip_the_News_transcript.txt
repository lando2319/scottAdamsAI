[Music]
hey everybody
go on in here it's time for a special
cinco de mayo episode of coffee with
scott adams
featuring the simultaneous sip which i
would say in spanish
if i could but i can't so let's just
call it
the simultaneous it's not going to take
much
hey you walnut creek in the house good
to see you good morning everybody
um there will be no cursing this morning
i mean unless things completely go off
the rails
no cursing i did my cursing last night
that will be my evening
evening cursing it's better to curse in
the evening i think it just fits better
this morning i overslept so i'd love to
tell you i'm really
prepared but i'm not
what do you do when you're not prepared
there's one thing you can always do
it doesn't take much all it takes is
a cuppa mug or glass attacker tells you
to sign a canteen sugar flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better including the damn
pandamik
and
[Laughter]
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens
now go
infection rates falling
i can feel it hello new york
all right uh it turns out that i've
developed
two different fan bases i think uh one
that likes it when i swear
the one that one that prefers that i'm
not so it's like i've split into two
characters
somebody like some some like the other
all right let's see what's going on here
so the new uh coronavirus death
model that's right i sent a death model
has been revised upwards of course
because
we're reopening some of the country
so what do you call it when things go
exactly the way everybody assumed they
would go
you call that news that's news my
friends
if things go exactly the way everybody
said they should go we'll go
can't really go any other way
that's called news and so it's been
jacked up to 134
thousand uh a new model
previous uh
so i guess 134 000 looks like it's not
just the minimum i'm looking at cnn's
text
i think that it's maybe the where they
actually think it will be
it's a little unclear if that's the new
minimum or that's the
just the prediction either way it's a
little absurd
but anyway and
um apparently the uh
is predicted to kill 3000 people a day
by june first nearly double the current
number
now let's just game this out three
thousand people a day
for june july
and august three thousand people a day
for ninety days how does that equal a
hundred and thirty four thousand
feels like it could be twice that
now that depends of course of course the
model
probably takes into account the
summer months and something magic about
summer
that makes us get less of the virus but
what is that
exactly so i don't know if 134
is really the low end the middle the
middle or the high end anymore
so but it's about where i thought it
would be so
i would say it's pretty close to where i
just assumed it would be there right
that's the whole point you go back to
work people die so what does
cnn do about this decision
well of course they're trying to cram it
down the president's throat
so that he will be responsible
personally for every death
that happens because we reopen the
economy and as i watch this form
you know you can see it you know just
sort of coming together you know that
what's going to happen for sure is that
governors will
open some states but cnn doesn't really
mock governors because it's not good
it's not a good model for television i
guess they prefer to mock
the head of the federal government it's
better tv
so trump is going to get blamed for
everything no matter what the governors
do
you know that right and watching this
take shape
is so disgusting to me i think i've
reached a new level
of just contempt
for for cnn's coverage i'll just say for
their coverage
rather than make it personal and here's
the thing
you know and i'll say this a million
more times nobody knows how to make the
right decision here
i don't even know if there is a right
decision there are just two ways that
people are going to die
is there a right decision when there's
just two ways people are going to die
and you got to pick which one
to put pressure on the the uh
the leaders let's say the governors and
all the decision makers
you know throw fouchi and berks in there
too they're they're
leaders and decision makers in this
context to put that pressure on them
that these deaths are sort of going to
be on their hands
is so so low and so contemptible
now i wouldn't say that they've they've
actually done that
you just see it you see it taking form
because what else are they going to talk
about
they're going to talk about who the
leaders killed right
with their decisions well he made this
decision
and now aunt sally's gone and here's
here's a people on this page and here's
all the names in their faces
and they all died because of the
decisions made by
you know these republicans or whatever
[Music]
and i'll say it again there's nothing
more important
than that we as a country understand
that there's no right decision
so if you're if you're hamstringing your
leaders
to make any decision because you're
ready to just
eviscerate them no matter what you're
not really helping
you're not helping you know i think i
think everybody has to get a pardon in
advance
for whatever happens i'm talking about
the governors the experts
the politicians i mean we just have to
find
some way to be okay with
decisions that can't be good they can't
be good
by their nature it's just too bad
decisions they're going to have to pick
one
so somebody's going to die and our
leaders have the very unenviable task of
doing it
i'm glad i don't i'm glad you don't
are you are you glad it's not your
decision i mean
you could make a decision i could make a
decision if i had to
you know if it were my job i'd do it but
i'm glad i don't
because whoever it makes is going to be
accused of murder
just for just doing their job just
trying to help the country
trying to get the country to a better
place no matter what anybody does no
matter what their intentions are no
matter how smart they are
even if they make all the right choices
they're going to be accused of murder
murder not just regular murder but like
mass murder
so that's the situation we put our
leaders in
and then we ask them to make good
decisions for us make us some good
decisions
and by the way we are going to accuse
you of murder
well i take that back we're going to
accuse you of mass murderer
no matter what you do i just don't want
to live in a country like that
um sean hannity is surprised
in a way he's actually uh
requesting that the armed protesters in
michigan
reconsider the military garb
and sean hannity's argument i think is
completely solid
somewhat unexpected which is the fun
part of the story
but um but solid argument and his
argument goes like this
that if you put a show of force on
against police officers
that's a very dangerous situation
because the police
they kind of have to maintain their own
control
right that's part of the job it's not
just standing around in a uniform
the the police have to exert authority
right they've got to exert that they are
the ultimate force of control
that's what keeps everybody safe the
last thing you want is people saying
well
police yes police no i don't have to do
what they
say i've got a gun they've got a gun my
gun's bigger
i don't know maybe i don't have to do
what they say so you could easily see it
sliding in the wrong direction
and so i think sean hannity is is making
a very it's a hard call because even
dan bongino came on his show right after
and said ah
i don't know second amendment freedom of
speech
everything they're doing is legal do you
tell people to stop
doing completely legal things in this
country
and so you could see both arguments can
you
i don't think dan bungie was wrong you
know we got laws
what gives anybody the right to throw
the laws away
like when did that happen right so
that's a good argument
dan bongino's argument completely solid
follow the constitution
they're they're following the
constitution as long as they follow the
constitution why shouldn't wait
right but hannity's argument is also
solid why would you want to put the
police
at risk and i think hannity has got a
good you know long
history of supporting law enforcement
and so he's being consistent on that
and and confesses that it's a very hard
call
to do anything that would be even
slightly anti-second amendment you know
he's got a concealed carry himself
as he reminds us so
here's my opinion on it and i don't
think anybody's opinion
should sway you because it's this is so
subjective
right you know i'm not going to tell you
my opinion is right or
or not right but under these very very
specific
conditions meaning that the next time
something comes up
don't ask me to be consistent with this
because this is just a one-off
so so anything i say about this should
not ever be generalized in the future to
any other situation it'll just be
different
the people with the guns are there
to support the constitution
that's my understanding they're not
there to overthrow the government
they're they're in fact there to support
the government
they're literally there to support the
the document if you will the
constitution that binds us all together
it's the thing that pays the police you
know ultimately the
the form of our government defined by
the constitution allows a structure in
which the police can get paid
so are the protesters
dangerous or are they
protecting the system it's really tough
isn't it
and um who said this the other day uh
oh is somebody smart on television said
that when you've got a gray area
somebody was saying that their father
gave them this advice maybe one of you
saw it
it was somebody wise was saying this
that when you when you have a gray area
and you know one direction is maybe
safety
and the other direction is maybe freedom
but it's a tough call
that you should always buy us toward
freedom
and that in the long run you end up
better that way if you bias toward
freedom
so here's my take
i've never seen a situation where the
armed militia types
have ever fired have you because they
show up on a lot of stuff
if you look at all the times that the
same same
types of people the ones who you know
are into that lifestyle the militia the
guns etc
they're very anti-shooting sort of super
anti-shooting i would say
because they're not there to shoot they
didn't come there for that they didn't
come
to shoot anybody what's the last thing
any of them with a gun
actually wants to happen the last thing
the last thing any of them want to
happen is to shoot anybody
they don't want to get shot they don't
want to shoot anybody it's the last
thing they want
so it's hard to get into the minds of
strangers
which i just did and so that you know i
probably shouldn't have
if i were to say okay let's treat them
as mindless we don't know what they're
thinking
yeah i'd say you don't want guns and
police officers in the same place
so if you ignore their internal mental
state
and maybe that's the smartest play maybe
maybe
energy has nailed this completely it's
just just look at the variables
lots of guns police put them in the same
place nothing good can happen
right that's that's a pretty adult
opinion and i i would respect him for
that opinion
but i gotta say i'm leaning the other
direction
i'm i'm leaning i'm leaning bongino in
this one
i'm leaning if they're there to protest
for their freedom
i don't know if the whole point of it is
freedom
how do you take their freedom away when
they're protesting for freedom
legally legally protesting for freedom
in legal ways
and you take some more of their freedom
away while they're protesting for
freedom how's that gonna go
what's what's more dangerous what's more
dude well i mean nobody's tried to take
their guns away that would be of course
crazy
but i guess i would lean toward letting
them do their thing
and here's another story the uh you
probably saw this
um apparently there's a chinese drone
maker
the of the smaller drones the kind that
law enforcement
would use and this gigantic chinese
company
just dropped their price or donated some
of them
and they're they're putting their drones
in lots of different local police forces
and part of what the drones are doing is
flying around and looking for
social distancing violators
do you feel comfortable with that
do you feel comfortable that there's
basically a chinese-made computer
because you know each of the drones has
a little intelligence in it
there's a little computer in those
drones from china
that's flying around and collecting
information on our citizens
what kind of information is it
collecting what does it know
just by flying around and being part of
the police force
could it listen in on the police force i
don't know
you know could could the drones be
modified to collect
information we don't know they're
collecting i don't know
could uh could anybody ever take
advantage of any of the
administrative or data that gets sent up
to headquarters does that even happen
does anything get sent to headquarters
i don't know but it doesn't matter
does it matter you've got a chinese-made
computer that they're giving away
to local law enforcement
[Music]
no no you can't let that company into
the united states
apparently homeland security has already
banned them from
homeland security but the local police
force is like hey
free drone of course i want a free drone
do i want a free drone yeah give me a
free drone that's what the local police
say
so they're accepting all these chinese
spy drones
they're not made exactly for spying but
you know what i mean
and let me ask you this do you think the
united states
has any companies that make some drones
i think so i think the united states has
companies that make drones
yes lots of them why the hell
are we buying chinese drones we should
we need to do that
and get rid of that immediately in fact
let's just get rid of everything we buy
from china if there's
any substitute in the united states i
don't care if it costs more
um of course that's easy for me to say i
know i know
all right uh so that's going on
there's a massachusetts golf course
owner who's going to defy the state's
lockdown and reopen for business
and this is a way more interesting story
than it sounds like as a headline
because the family that's reopening
i guess it's family-owned golf courses
the family that's doing this
in in defiance of the state just lost a
family member to coronavirus
just lost a grandmother in a tragic
situation so the whoever the
representative of the family was saying
believe me we get it like you're we're
not
we're not in any you know we're not
confused
about how deadly this is grandma just
died from it
and we still want to open up the golf
course you know partly because it's
something you could social distance a
little bit easier than most
but also because there's no choice
there's just no choice
you know people need to eat got to get
going
so i would say i support this
massachusetts golf course
if it opened in my state i would go golf
the police would come probably probably
and maybe i'd have to go home but if
they reopened the next day
i'd try to go golf again then the police
would come they'd send me home
and maybe some other businesses would
try to reopen and maybe there would be
too many businesses for the police
maybe don't know am i am i
uh suggesting civil disobedience
i'm not suggesting it i'm saying it's
coming
i don't need to suggest it that
civil disobedience is guaranteed this is
america
have you heard have you heard of
americans
you've probably heard of us right and
most of you are american
we like to protest so i mean we'll we'd
protest a yam sandwich
so do you think anybody's gonna have
some civil disobedience about
closing down the economy for another
month oh yeah oh yeah it's coming
um
here's uh
so i i put some questions or put a tweet
on
twitter and told people to ask me
questions
and i would answer them and by the way
are you seeing that every day we get a
conflicting data about
hydroxychloroquine
i feel as though every day somebody says
hey it's great this trial well it's not
conclusive but
looks good and then 10 minutes later
yeah you know
here's all the reasons why it probably
doesn't work and
i feel like we can't get any good
information what was the last thing we
learned about that was actually true
have we learned anything that's true
about the coronavirus
has just fact-checked me on this is
there even
one thing about the coronavirus and
one scientific or other data fact
that actually turned out to be true from
the the viral
amount of it to what it was the
spreading to humans do masks work
do are ventilators good or bad think
about
name one thing we got right i can't
i can't think of one thing we got right
we didn't have enough of stuff and then
we had too much of stuff
name one thing we got right nothing not
a single thing
now i'm not too harsh about getting
things wrong in a
in the context of a pandemic because
your first actions are
you know just guessing really
all right i'm looking for my own tweet
in which i ask people to ask me
questions
if you would like to ask me a question
that's where you should have put it
there are 200 questions and
so will trump debate biden in person
um i'm feeling like the odds are
no if i had to bet on it right now
i'd say 70 percent no would be my bet
and there would be two reasons for that
number one
i think that the democrats will do
everything they can to not have a debate
they'll use the coronavirus excuse etc
um trump will probably say he wants to
do it
biden might also say he wants to do it
but gosh if only i could
no i don't think it will happen and i
think that the
democrats know that that's a losing
proposition so they'll use the
coronavirus to avoid it
i think why are healthy people being
quarantined
because they could become carriers why
are we still asking that question
[Laughter]
how do we get how do we get to may
and there's somebody and i know this
this user uh
because we interact a lot on twitter but
this is somebody who's like really
following
and i'm not making fun of you i'm just
i'm just honestly curious
how could you get all the way to may and
not know at least the argument
for why healthy people are being you
know locked down
the argument is that they won't be
healthy they'll go out and get it and
bring it back and kill grandma
now you could argue that that's not a
good enough reason
you could say that the costs are greater
than you know the benefits
that would be an argument but to ask why
are healthy people being
quarantined don't we all know that now
i mean i'm not saying it's the right
answer but we should know the reason
um
all right and so we're seeing people
uh criticizing trump on the 60 000
expected deaths
and you saw it on world world omitter
um well yeah the numbers are all over
the place and everybody
speaks imprecisely about them
and you saw me do it just a moment ago
so i was looking i was reading cnn
looking at it and i realized that the
cnn report doesn't tell me if that's the
low estimate
the likely estimate or the high or what
i mean what good is that
when you've got a vast range and they
give me one number uh
i don't know is that the low the middle
it's all useless information
um what do i think about the 16
19 project so that's the new york times
project where they were going to write
long series about institutional
racism and how it all came from slavery
etc
and i guess they got the pulitzer prize
for that
which uh pulitzer prize is like six
people sitting in the living room who
saw 0.000
or 1 of the
creative stuff that got created that
year and they said oh we like this one
the most useless stupid completely
non-prestigious award the pulitzer prize
is just ridiculous
it'd be like you just making up a prize
uh
i'd like to give the carl and jane
prize for literature uh it's just me
you know just me jane and me we just had
their living room
and we decided we'd like this book
better than this one so we're going to
give it the
carl and jane prestigious award
that is exactly as valuable
as the pulitzer prize no difference
it's just some people in their living
room probably got together on so
on zoom and said uh do you read these
seven books that were submitted yeah
which one do you like ah
they're all pretty good how about this
one yeah all right let's pull the
surprise
useless all right um
and then i guess historians complained
that the
some of the articles that came out of
that 1619 project were
inaccurate i would go on i would go
further and say
that they were written for naked
political purposes
and that we shouldn't take any of it too
seriously
andreas asks how have you stayed
motivated before dilbert became
a success uh excellent question
and the answer is for my entire
life as a young person
i expected to be successful
and successful on some kind of a
a level where the the rest of the world
noticed you know not just sort of
successful privately but successful in
some way that
the public knew about it and
i've never not felt it i i think i was
born with that feeling
i mean i felt it from my earliest
memories i always thought
i'm going to be famous someday just
always
and i've told this story before that
adults would tell me that too
when i was a kid they would say someday
you're going to be really rich and
famous
and i never knew why they were saying
that i mean i knew i thought it myself
but i also didn't know if everybody
thought that
i kind of wonder how many of you let me
ask in the comments
while i'm finishing my story here how
many of you
when you were a kid thought that you
would be
famous someday i'm just wondering
because i always thought i would
now obviously that causes you to make
certain choices in your life
that make it more likely it's going to
happen so there's a
there's a causal element there but how
many of you
thought you would be famous when you
were kids i'm just curious because when
i was a kid i didn't know if it was just
the way everybody felt
i thought maybe everybody you know was
optimistic and dreamed about
good things but i didn't dream about it
i expected it it just was a different
feeling i can tell the difference when
i'm just dreaming about
stuff oh i'm looking at people's answers
this is fascinating i didn't know
where this was going there were a lot of
yeses i see some no's
oh my goodness that's very common
i i didn't know i had no idea which way
that question was going to go
apparently it's universal i mean not
universal because i see some no's
but if i were just based on the answers
which is very non-representative of the
sample
it's just the people wanted to answer um
wow there's a i don't know what
percentage but we can conclude from the
comments that a lot of people
thought that they would be famous
someday interesting
so i guess i should take it to be
nothing you know because it felt like it
was almost
a premonition but if everybody had the
same premonition that it
didn't work out for most people i'd have
to say it's just just how kids feel i
guess
so to finish this answer how do i stay
motivated
i've never not been motivated so
i don't know what it's like to feel
unmotivated
i don't even know what that feels like
because i've always felt like
um almost like there was a
a problem with myself that i needed to
fix
you know when we talk about success and
motivation and things
uh we tend to because we're america and
you know we're a certain type of people
we tend to put the most positive spin on
success
and we say motivation ambition
we tend to put a positive frame on those
things
because we like to encourage people to
do those things make sense
but when you're actually that person
and you're the person who has that
ambition and has that motivation
it doesn't always feel like it's a
positive
it feels like a flaw that you're trying
to fix
now i don't know how many other people
would back me up on that feeling that
may be
highly individual i don't know but what
i feel like
is a continuous weight on me
that i should have done more and i can't
shake it
i wake up thinking i should have done
more and i go to bed
thinking i should have done more that
day and i can't wait
wait to wake up i hate sleep i just i
just dislike the whole
idea of sleeping because it takes me
away from my day
and my day is when i can do stuff and i
can get stuff done
i can accomplish things right i can i
can make a difference
when i'm sleeping sleeping's like
suspended
animation sleeping is like practice for
being dead
sleeping has no place in my world except
unfortunately
it's necessary for good health so you
should do everything you can to sleep
you know sleep a healthy amount don't
want to convince anybody to sleep less
but
i'm just telling you how i feel so to
answer andre's question i've never
felt unmotivated so i suspect some of
that is just baked into your
your nature i i don't know it's always
been
there it's never going away and it feels
like an
itch that can't be scratched but i spend
my whole life
scratching anyway is that good
i don't know because i don't know if i
have the capability
to be let's say retired you know i'm at
that age where everybody thinks
seriously about it
and um you know there many times
i've thought you know wouldn't it be
great to be retired
what if i could wake up and just do
anything i wanted
what if i didn't have to work what if i
could sleep as long as i want
do anything i want when i wake up not
worry about money
and just live out my days you know like
a perfect free human
that nobody ever gets to be like nobody
ever gets to be free
just wake up do what you want not run
out of money
who gets to do that i have no interest
in that
i have no interest because that's
available to me now
i can stop working you know i know you
hate me for it because
especially now when people are having a
tough time it's just the truth
i could stop working i could just wake
up and
just eat and play around and just have a
good time for the rest of my life i
could
i have no interest in it it sounds like
hell to me
because it doesn't scratch my itch it
doesn't make me feel like i've done
anything useful
and that only useful for myself because
i already got what i need
i'm almost entirely externally focused
at this point in my career
because if it's not good for you not
interested
if it doesn't help if it doesn't help
someone else
no interest at all not even a little bit
so my ambition
to sort of further to andre's question
my ambition has changed over the years
from a
pure personal ambition to you know i've
got to get somewhere personally
to oh now what do i do because once i
got it
what do i do what am i going to do with
that
and so almost immediately upon getting
what i
thought i wanted my ambition changed
to external and i thought to myself well
you know could i run for public office
and i thought what would be a bigger
waste of my talents
than to put me in a meeting
okay you know if you've watched me long
enough you say to yourself okay what
what is it that you're good at
what is it that you could contribute to
the world and now
uh now you've got to go raise money and
attend meetings
let's just be the biggest waste of time
ever for my specific
set of talents so i try to find ways
such as this in which
i could do something that would be
potentially useful
which is why i've started to put the
micro lessons
on the locals.com platform
so right now there's a lesson on how to
be funny i think my next lesson will
either be personal finance
very very short lesson on that for those
who just don't know anything about it
uh or maybe design i'm gonna probably do
one of those
today maybe all right so i'm always
motivated
it's just the nature of it changed um
shota says what are some techniques to
wake up and start the day off great
uh and
the answer is if you don't drink coffee
i don't know what the answer to that
question is
um one of the things that i teach in
fact
just yesterday somebody somebody said
that this lesson changed their life
so what i'm going to tell you now this
will be the short version of it but
somebody just told me yesterday changed
their life to hear this idea
that we're moist robots i wrote about
this in my head failed almost everything
and still win big
book you see on the shelf back there and
the idea of a moist robot is that it
just responds to inputs
so if you put an input into a computer
you you'll get an output
and that if you treat yourself like that
instead of some kind of
mental creature if you treat yourself as
a mind
you don't know what to do with it
because you don't quite know how to
manage a mind it's more of a concept
but if you manage your physical body and
you manage it right you can produce the
right kind of thoughts and actions and
stuff that your mind likes
so i teach people to reprogram their
mind
by programming their physical
environment
and their physical body and also
associating
rewards with things they want their
physical body to do
so one of the things that i want to do
is wake up and be productive
who doesn't right if it were free and
easy and didn't take any work
wouldn't you all want to wake up and be
productive you might want to wake up at
different times
but everybody wants to be productive so
i use the moist robot technique
to train myself like a dog and the way i
do that is
i say hey if you do this trick you get a
treat
and the treat is this protein bar
this specific one because it's one that
i like i'm not saying you'll like it i'm
just saying i like it
and delicious cup of coffee which when
combined
in the same bite a bite of the chocolate
peanut butter
protein bar with the sips of coffee
is really really good and the coffee
wakes me up it gives me a buzz
and my body registers the buzz right
it's a little shot of energy and your
your body recognizes that as a treat
and then you do the taste treat and the
in you know maybe you're a little
hungry when you woke up anyway and then
those two tastes go together and it's
like a taste
explosion of awesomeness now it doesn't
matter that you don't like these things
because if you were doing it you would
pick your own treat
your treat might be i don't watch a tv
show
your treat might be take a walk in the
morning maybe it's whatever you like
but the the trick is for whoever said
how do you wake up in the morning
is you should pair your wake up routine
and you should turn it into a routine so
it's not different every day
with a treat a really really good one
and let me tell you if you heard this
and said yourself
uh a protein bar and a cup of coffee
that's not much of a treat
that's just food and beverage you could
have food and beverage all day
why is that a treat well the the thing
you might miss is how much i like it
so if you don't like it find something
you do
is i really really like the first two
hours of my day
by far they're they're extraordinary the
first two hours of every day for my life
are extraordinary pretty much every time
there's almost nothing else that's as
good the rest of the day unless
you know unless christina's involved
how popular will pop-up drive-in movies
be this summer
well i saw that somebody somebody's got
some pop-up movie
theaters that already happened so i
predicted that that would happen
and i know it's happened at least one
place maybe more
and there have been the drive-in
church services as well and i guess
dr the people just parking in a parking
lot and listening to the
the pastor on on their car radio turned
out to be too dangerous
which is ridiculous if i had to guess
you'll see more of that
in the summer but not much more um
[Laughter]
practical bob says this uh is kb
i assume he's referring to my fiance
christina uh as hot looking in person as
pictures no no she is not
um christine is not as hot looking in
person
she is way hotter way hotter in person
there is no photograph that could ever
capture her
total beauty so now i'm sad to say
that she does not look as good as her
pictures she looks way better than her
pictures
way better um
that's true by the way and
the 15-minute kova tests uh
can it be done multiple done at a time
or is it one at a time well
that's a good question you know do you
have to wait 15 minutes before you do
the next test and the answer is
um i doubt it i doubt i would assume
that they can batch them up and just
test test test and then everybody's just
waiting for results
or at the very least you've got more
than one test
test station so yeah there might be ways
to make that faster
the new york times calling for the dnc
to investigate
tara reid's complaint
how can they suggest such a thing with a
straight face
it does make you wonder yeah there's so
much happening in the news that you just
look at it you say
do they really mean that or
are they just saying that because they
know it sounds good you really can't
tell anymore can you
you really can't tell if people mean
what they say
in any uh in any
real way do i follow brilliant
geopolitical writer peter zayn
i don't i don't know if i follow him
i've read his stuff but i'm not too
familiar
um i answered about the armed protesters
the sweet caroline says do you think
most people
will do what's proper and if they want
to work they should be able to
and the answer is yes most people will
do most things properly
but twenty percent will not if twenty
percent
don't do what they should do is that
good enough
will the other eighty percent be okay if
the twenty percent
don't do what they're supposed to do and
the answer is they won't be
when the 20 don't do their
social distancing etc it will
be a problem and it will extend to other
people but
there also isn't another way so i don't
like to complain
about things that can't change as a
general rule i probably do
but it's a good rule not to complain
about things that can't change
and one thing that can't change is that
you're not going to get 100
of adults to act like adults there's no
there's no practical way that that could
ever happen so
it shouldn't be part of our planning to
assume that it would
so assuming that uh a hundred percent of
people or anything close to it
would obey social distancing would be i
think
probably unwise
yeah 20 percent failure rate
could be catastrophic but we don't know
so again i'll throw this in the category
of
is there any expert who can answer this
question no
no there's no expert who can answer that
question it's just one of our many
unknowns
um
let's see the the research professor in
pittsburgh that was on the verge of
making a
significant findings on how this
he was just found murdered in his home
what
uh is this new
here's a coronavirus researcher dead
huh looks like a murder suicide well i
don't know
questions i got questions who knows uh
what do your notes look like for these
periscopes
that's a funny question uh the answer is
i just print them out before i start
and if it looks like there's a lot of
text on the page i didn't type that i
just cut and paste
from news headlines and then i i
talk about the headline
so usually i have uh two pages of notes
that are just cut and paste from the
what's happening some tweets and stuff
um
does the communist party of china
provide levels of
remuneration to social media giants that
should concern us
well you know it's funny the in every
situation that we know of in life
whoever has the most money in that
situation
ends up controlling it now that's worked
out
pretty well for the united states for a
long time because the united states
always had the most money
so we could have you know the most
influence over institutions because we
funded them the most
influence over other countries because
we supported them militarily
so it's just a fact that whoever has the
most money
be they the billionaire in the room or
the
rich country they influence things more
there's no way to stop that
because it's a power they have it they
can use it it's legal it's going to
happen
the problem is that china is just simply
by its size alone will come to have more
money than the united states
so if the united states and china both
did let's say similarly well with their
economy
just because of the number of people in
china there would be
is it four times as big three times as
big somebody do the math for me
three times as big three to four times
as big
so china should have something like
three to four times more money
should they even pull even with us in
economics you know per capita so to
speak
so in theory china will dominate the
world
it's just math there's no way it can not
happen the only way china
could not dominate the world in the
future is if their economy doesn't grow
as well as ours does and
so in order for the united states to
continue its
probably oversized dominance of a lot of
things that we don't even know about
you know you have to assume that the
united states does what china is doing
which is to use their power and
influence everything else to
you know buy us everything that we can
buy us in our direction
in order to keep that up china has to do
less well in the long run
one way they could do less well is we
could send them back their
stupid spy drones and we could not buy
stuff in china in the future
so that would help so yes we should be
very worried about their
monetary influence on social media as
well as every other part of our
existence um
what will happen to office politics in
the age of uh
mostly staying home i guess um
that's a good question because
i do wonder what is the value of all the
in-person interaction in the office you
know the thinking has always been
that all of this casual interaction in
the office leads to
positive but unplanned benefits
you know you cross-pollinate with ideas
and you you find somebody to work with
and you get your answers
quickly and all that but nobody's ever
tested that
i'm not aware of any scientific
evidence that would suggest that being
in the same office gives you a better
result
we feel it intuitively like it's true
because you
you can influence somebody personally in
a way that you can't influence them as
well
or a video so does that make a
difference we don't know
we only know it will be different so it
could be that the politics will decrease
the time wasters will decrease but there
might be other problems you know the the
work at homers will start just not
answering their phone
that would be my guess i think where
it's all going is that
when it's new and everybody's working at
home
and you're not used to it yet you answer
your phone when it rings
and you answer your zooms and your
skypes but something tells me
that as we do more and more work at home
everybody will learn
that the smart people don't answer the
phone
[Laughter]
and then what happens i don't know
will biden be the candidate in november
i'd say 50 50.
but whether or not he's actually the
candidate on the ticket in november
i do think people will be looking at the
vice president
um speaking of which oh my god did you
see what the president did
last night i think it was last night on
an interview
he said that so trump said that he
thinks biden
should pick elizabeth warren because she
deserves it
and i tweeted nothing makes me happier
than watching trump give biden bad
advice
it is so diabolical it is so funny
you know he does it you know he does it
with like a twinkle in his brain
like he's not letting on that this is a
joke
but is so diabolical the way he gets in
in the heads of competitors
i would hate to golf with him have you
ever have you ever thought to yourself
what would it be like to just golf
with trump and let's say you were pretty
good you were a good golfer
can you imagine how much you would get
in your head before you even hit the
first golf ball
i can't imagine he ever loses a golf
even if he plays people who are better
because he probably so messes with their
psychology that by the time they try to
swing
they're hitting the ball backwards
anyway here's the beauty
part of suggesting that suggesting that
biden owes it to what
she deserves it because when you use
language
like that that's like emotional language
so he's trying of course to get the
democrats
spun up to fight with each other which
is so funny
that like lastly i saw that tweet i'm
like oh you just have to keep doing this
because it's i think it's the second
time now he's given bad advice to biden
but made it act like he was he was
serious yeah i got your back on this
whole
tara reid thing i think you should go
out there and defend yourself
and when you hear when you hear the
president's bad advice to biden
and you know he's only doing it because
biden is
mentally degraded let's face it he's
mentally degraded
these things wouldn't work with somebody
who is more capable
but biden is not that person so the
president can just
totally mess with the psychology of
their situation
do it with a straight face and the news
doesn't even know how to report this
because i can't tell i don't know is he
kidding
was that a joke is he trying to mess
with him
or does he really think that elizabeth
warren would be
what's going on here and of course he's
messing with him it should be pretty
obvious i don't have to read his mind to
know that
i would call that an obvious one
but here's the beauty of it
first of all elizabeth warren would be
the worst choice
because she's stronger than biden that's
that's rule number one
of picking your vice president you want
the public to say
okay of these two people you know it's
obvious which one is the presidential
candidate
and it's obvious which one is the vice
president because they're like a
weaker version of the president right if
you see
donald trump and mike pence
you know who is the president right
you know because i i always say good
things about pence
i don't agree with him on a lot of stuff
you know i'm not
on the real religious stuff etc you know
we don't see eye to eye
but pence is a good egg i think just
he's just a good solid citizen
and he's perfect vice president because
he just doesn't make too many mistakes
he didn't wear that mask that one time
but that's no biggie
and but if you if you take elizabeth
warren
and put her side by side with biden
everybody's going to say
uh yeah you see what's wrong here right
elizabeth warren's like twice as capable
i was biting it's not even close
you know mentally if you were to
let's say you were to uh um give them
both an
sat test or an lsat or
an iq test elizabeth warren versus biden
that's not going to be close right say
what you will about your elizabeth
warrens
and i have but she's super smart
can't say the same for biden right so if
you put her as a vice president
presidential choice it just ruins
everything which is why it's hilarious
that he would
he would say that she's earned it you
can't even say no
she's earned it you know so then if he
doesn't pick her
the president has put in their heads
that he picks somebody who didn't earn
it
so let me further my uh
further my long-held prediction by
saying this
if you picture elizabeth warren and
biden
you know just in your mind your mind's
eye picture them side by side
as i said warren looks stronger now
picture kamala harris
side by side with biden ah
now you see it don't you now you see it
kabula harris is close to
sort of similar to biden she didn't give
far enough in the
primaries to be sort of elizabeth warren
level
she's one level down she's just about
equivalent with biden but she's strong
enough
because she went through the process of
running for president
she's strong enough that if she were to
become president
people would say uh that's legitimate
she was in the primaries
she she made a dent in the primaries
she's a legitimate
presidential candidate people took her
seriously she had a lot of supporters
she didn't make it that far in the
primaries but she's a serious candidate
yes we accept her as our
new president if that's the way it's
going to go
uh so kabul just she checks off every
box
right and somebody says scott is still
trying to
persuade his prediction into reality
well let me ask you this
do you think the democrats are listening
to me do you think there's anything that
i'll say
that could persuade the democrats my
my assumption is that they're going to
end up there on their own
because that's just water traveling
downhill in other words
the the path of least resistance
i didn't create i'm not the person who
created
the path i'm simply describing it i'm
just standing there
saying look there's two paths one of
them this elizabeth warren is a brick
wall
you can see it i'm not making the brick
wall there i'm just saying you can see
it too
i didn't put that brick wall there now
look at kamala harris it's a different
path
yeah there's nothing in that path
there's
nothing stopping her from being
president
if she if biden you know stays in
pictures vp wins the election i think
that's unlikely
but that would be the path
stacy abrams i think just can't be taken
seriously
think about the bad feelings you have
for kamala harris
think about so you mostly trump
supporters on this periscope
think to yourself your think about your
emotional feeling about kamala harris
and now
ask yourself how different is that from
the emotional feeling
that democrats felt when trump started
becoming you know a serious candidate
think about how they felt about him it
was like this visceral
it was almost like you disliked him
before he had a reason there's something
about his personality his
braggadocio his you know his playing
loose with the facts it was like ah
now maybe you and i didn't feel that
but you certainly observed that the
democrats were having this
just contempt feeling this like you know
almost a bodily hatred for trump now ask
yourself did that stop him from becoming
president
no because that thing that made people
hate
trump is just the other side of the
thing that made people fall in love with
him
and there there are people who support
trump who are
you know almost cult-like they just love
him and this is true of obama and other
people as well it's not just trump
but he he um trump
causes your emotions to catch on fire
and you either love him or you hate him
but there's not a lot in between which
is actually pretty predictive of
somebody who could become president
the one you don't want is where
everybody says well i don't love him
i don't really hate him he's just in
this middle ground
somewhere that's where biden is that's
why that's why biden is so weak
because he doesn't make you love him he
doesn't make you hate him
he just exists that's usually not a good
sign of future leadership
kamala harris the moment i mention her
name
some of you just go enraged now that's
too strong
but you have an emotional reaction to
her
people are saying ah she slept her way
to the top
she put people in jail she she lied
about some racist stuff she accused
somebody of she'll
she'll do anything she's a skier
think about what you feel about her
don't you feel a stronger emotion
negative about kamala than some other
people
ask yourself do you have do you have the
same feeling about kamala
like just just examine your internal
feeling as you did
about say let's cory booker you might
have said oh i don't think cory booker
should be president
but do you have the same visceral feel
for cory booker i'll bet you don't
i'll bet you say you know cory booker
looks like a good guy he's just not the
guy i'd want for president
how about andrew yang does anybody hate
andrew yang probably not probably
basically nobody
but do you get like super excited well
you get excited in a certain way with
yang
you know he's interesting and stuff but
he doesn't really
he doesn't cause you to love him like
some people do
you know you don't hate him you don't
love him
he's interesting but he's interesting in
the middle
so here's my uh here's my overall
statement of that
the fact that you have such a negative
feeling about kamala harris
tells you there's something about her
that's reaching you emotionally
if it's true that there's another side
to that
she might actually be able to move
democrats
emotionally as well so look for the
person who's got
who can make you feel something she
definitely makes you feel
something i don't know if there's a
positive side of that yet i haven't
really seen it
but she definitely feels she makes you
feel the negative if you're on the other
team
so follow the power of emotion to find
the same with aoc you can hate
everything about aoc
but just examine the depth of your
feeling
that's the thing that is predictive it's
the depth of it
not your intellectual opinions um what
is your favorite movie
at least at the moment i dislike movies
as an art form
because in 2020 they just take too long
they're too self-indulgent
it's more about the director and they
put ridiculous
hackneyed crap in every movie now if i
see one more damn by the way i have a
rule
let me tell you my rule for watching
drama
i will turn on a movie okay got good
ratings lots of action
i can watch that sometimes as soon as
the star
or any part of the movie is tied to a
chair
i turn it off that's my rule i've been
following this for years
do you know how many movies i've turned
off because
at some point somebody is tied to a
chair
yeah 75 percent 75 percent of all
action movies i turn off when they get
to the tied to the chair part
because first of all i don't want to see
it everything that happens with that
tied to the chair part
is going to be unpleasant i don't want
to think about it i don't want to
imagine it even as a
you know fiction i don't want it in my
head i just need to fast forward past
that part
but i'm not gonna the fact that you put
that in there
and you thought that i wanted to watch
that it's just hackneyed
it's boring it's it's redundant
and if that's the best you can do for
your movie i'm out
like if that's if that's your symbol of
creativity why don't i do what everybody
else does tie somebody to a chair i'm
out um
all right i'm a little bit over time
here so i don't want to go too far
uh let's see if there's one more
question
how much testing is needed to accomplish
something useful in opening the country
my answer is and i'm i'm pretty
confident to this
let's put my confidence at 75 80 percent
so you know good solid 20 20 20 25
i might be wrong about this but my
current thinking about testing is we
can't get there
at all that there's no way to test
enough
that we will consider in the end when we
look back at it oh thank goodness
we had enough testing and the right kind
of testing and we tested the right
people in the right way
that we really got a handle in this
thing my prediction is there's nothing
that looks even remotely like that's
going to happen
not even a little bit we're nowhere near
being able to test in the right way fast
enough
etc now i have optimism in humanity
in the sense that maybe something will
get invented
but somebody would have to invent
something that could be scaled up
quickly
that doesn't yet exist is that going to
happen in three months
or one month when we need it i don't
think so
seems pretty unlikely to me could happen
you know i'd like to keep that
solid 20 maybe it'll happen
uh and i do think generally speaking
that humanity will rise to the challenge
and as we're looking at this crushing
amount of death that we're looking at
for going back to work
i would if i had to bet we're going to
be
super super clever in the next 30 days
and then we will just devise things you
know
mechanisms systems technologies
inventions
i mean it's going to look crazy in the
next 30 days of how much
human innovation just pops out of this
some of it might be important and make a
difference i don't think it'll be the
testing
if you had to guess testing is just one
of many variables that could make a
difference
so what are the odds it's that one
single one i'm going to bet against it
so i'm going to say that testing will
not be your answer and i say the same
thing about
vaccines i don't think the vaccine hope
is real frankly i don't think it's real
i think that's just a you know make you
feel good
um it might work but if we can come up
with a coronavirus vaccine for the first
time in human history
well wouldn't that be surprising if you
know what i mean
um all right
does it make sense for bill gates to
speak in favor of the
chinese government's handling of the
plague
and the answer is i'm going to back bill
gates
every time he says something that is
true even if you don't like it
so is it true that the chinese
government acted aggressively
and decisively in a way that only they
could
and probably made a big difference in
the in the plague
i would say yes i would agree with um
i would agree with bill gates that as
far as we can tell
we might find out something later but as
far as we could tell
it looks like china effectively handled
it
even if you don't like the way they did
it you know even if you don't like the
fact that they
you know lock people in their houses
till they starved or whatever the hell
happened if you don't like the fact that
you know there's lots
there's lots of stuff not to like but
what i like about bill gates is he'll
give you the difficult answer if it's
also true
it's a difficult answer because do do i
want to say in public
yeah you know i got my criticisms but
if you looked at the big picture the
chinese government
took care of business maybe not in the
way their citizens wanted them to
a lot of probably a lot of victims out
of that but
you gotta say they it looks like they
got past it
maybe so i i favor bill gates saying
things that are honest
um i that's one of his primary
benefits to the country i think is that
he does tell you what
what actually is true um so
uh he's also the largest donor to the
world health organization
and has conflicts of interest well
here's the thing
tell me if you will what you think bill
gates's intention is
if if i thought that bill gates was
trying to make money
or or influence politics
i would have a very different opinion of
him but you know that's not true
right you know bill gates is not in this
for the money
don't you i mean really don't you know
that but he's not into this for the
money
because it kind of wouldn't make sense
for him to be in it for the money
i mean not this you think he decided to
be the richest guy in the world and go
spend a lot of time working on
african toilet design which he does
because he's trying to make some money
on toilets no
no bill gates is the real deal
and and maybe the reason i can see it
uh in my opinion more clearly
is because i'm i'm the the smallest
version of him
meaning that i've i've experienced
making my own money
and then running out of things to do i
just talked about it earlier
right i took care of myself now what do
i do
it is quite natural that you are because
you're a human
living in a human society that the next
thing you say is
oh well if i took care of myself and my
family
let's see what i can do for the world so
i
guarantee it there are very few things i
would say with a hundred percent
certainty this will be one of them i
guarantee it 100 the bill gates is the
real deal
meaning that he's only doing it to help
the world period
nothing else no no you could say oh it's
you know it's good for him too
because people will feel good about his
legacy or whatever okay
sure i mean that's part of it too but
it's not the reason
it's not the reason i don't i don't do
anything for a legacy
because i expect to be dead i don't
think bill
i don't think bill gates is a believer
uh i don't think he believes in the
afterlife i'm not positive about that
i don't know if he's talked about it um
but i
i don't think he's i don't think he's
playing for his legacy
i think he's playing for right now i
think he's the real deal that's it
i'll talk to you tonight you know where
you know when
