and welcome to the highlight of your
life and civilization itself sort of a
bright glowing
spot in this big
universe of darkness
but
where you are
things are looking up things are looking
up and all you need to take it to
another level is a copper mugger glass
of tanker shelves to sign a canteen
jogger a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
you're right dennis that's scott adams
is one bad dude
true fact check true
and now will you join me
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine here today the thing that makes
everything better in the entire world
it's called the simultaneous sip and
nothing's ever been better go
i would like to start
with a checklist
for
the golden age you ready
i think i might i might put this on
paper
thinking about
i was thinking about all the things
which have
somewhat subtly turn positive
while we're in this environment of
everything going to
and you can lose you can lose sight of
anything that's maybe getting better
because our focus is always on you know
the latest disaster
number one
there have been no major forest fires in
california this year now knock on wood
right
but i believe that's because of the
helicopter rapid response team
i think we're actually
getting on the fires faster in other
words we adjusted we found a way to make
a difference we're not talking about it
right
you know why is nobody talking about
california on fire i it could be luck
it could be luck it could be weather it
could be chance right
but i feel like maybe we got on top of
it
or at least at least there's a
substantial improvement
how about climate change and
nuclear energy which is really the only
solution to it
all positive
all positive everything in the nuclear
energy field went from super negative i
don't know five years ago
to
super positive
so you got your climate change your
nuclear energy now in the short run
in the short run we've got a lot of
challenges with
uh power etc
now let me ask you about
let's talk about inflation
energy prices seem to have maybe
stabilized and dropped a little too soon
to be happy
but but it looks like inflation
at least on the energy part the biggest
part
looks like it might have slowed down and
then the energy cost if it slows down
will ripple through the the rest of the
product stuff
we might have seen something closer to
the top of inflation i guess some of the
core stuff is still going to be higher
for a few months but that should get
pulled back they should get pill pulled
back
because they're
now let's take
china i just saw another article it's
all it's hard to speculate what's
happening in china right we don't know
but it looks like china is an actual
recession already
if you read the tea leaves right they
don't report that but it looks like they
might be
and it looks like
china as the growing power that we have
to worry about
may have taken quite a hit
because i think their manufacturing base
will be
i would say drained forever
i don't think people are going back
so in terms of how we deal with china
even though it's hard for our supply
chains and stuff i believe we're
probably moving our pharma back
because
if anything scared us straight
i would imagine big pharma has plenty of
money am i right
does big pharma have money of course
they've got all they need
so they can move their plants back to
wherever they need to get it out of
china so i believe
that our our position in the world
relative to china
is better
what do you think
i mean you can easily be wrong we could
all be wrong about this stuff but even
though we both took a hit
i believe the united states took will
take less of a hit going forward
about russia
our two biggest competitors in the world
right russia and china
i feel like russia is taking a step
backwards relative to the united states
at the same time the united states is
not doing you know terrific
but relatively i think we opened a gap
so i would say that the united states
has improved its position maybe
maybe with russia and china its two
biggest competitors
i think we'll get past inflation
what about that risk of nuclear war with
russia
i haven't worried about it lately have
you
i feel like we're past it
and i feel like there's some kind of a
stalemate situation happening there
that's expensive
but
i feel like
you're the end point of ukraine is
looking a little more clear looks like a
stalemate
where russia will control what they
control
and ukraine will complain about it
forever
right
how about
a.i
now ai is either going to be the
greatest thing or the worst thing but
it's going to change everything
you know whatever you think about the
change that ai will bring you have no
idea
there's nothing that will be the same
after virtual reality and ar hit
ai
if you combine ai in virtual reality
what life looks like in 10 years
is completely unpredictable
you there's just no way to know it's
going to go i mean it's gonna be really
interesting
but it might be better
there's a whole segment of the world
that literally can't find happiness
because the resources don't exist
right there are people who can't find a
a mate
which is sort of important
for happiness
right
and
i think people will just you know take a
drug put on the vr helmet and go into
their other life and that other life
will be fully satisfying
even if in the other life they're in
love with an ai in an npc or something
driven by an ai it'll be a relationship
and it'll be somebody that's not you
know treating them poorly so i think
that for
i don't know
60 to 80 percent of the public
they would be better off with an ai
partner
eventually
and everybody who disagrees with that
100 of the people who disagree with that
statement
are thinking of
current technology which couldn't come
close to that
but future technology and it's not that
far in the future
if you in the future there will be a
better version
of a human for your for your enjoyment
than any human could ever compete with
it won't even be close
in the long run it won't even be close
right it'll take a while for the
crossover we're not there
people still better than robots still
better
but that that gap is just closing like
crazy there's no question where it's
going
i mean it can only go one direction
can they do plumbing and electrical
probably
probably
all right um
i made a
claim on
twitter i got a slight adjustment to by
paul graham
if you don't know paul graham you can
google him but
he's one of the high value accounts you
know tech founder
generally considered one of the smart
people in
in california or silicon valley or i'm
not sure where he lives now but anyway
the part of that is he's real smart so
when he says stuff you should pay
attention
and i had said provocatively
that the most valuable words for success
are be useful
that if you didn't know anything else
about anything else and you're just like
well how do i be successful
just focus on being useful
and the more useful you are the better
off you'll be right
more is better but be useful
if you focus on that things will go well
now a lot of people agreed
uh paul graham added this twist
he said
that if it's business that's effectively
making what people want
so
basically if you're in a business
being useful translates to making
products that people want
and here's the part here's the part that
gets interesting
i'm not sure that's exactly right
it's like close
feels like a like an 80
sort of situation
and
here's why i think there's a difference
but help me think this through right
this is like preliminary thinking
in my opinion
if you focus on what the customer wants
you can get a good good result if you
focus on
making yourself useful
i think you could also get a good result
if you focus on making yourself useful
via the process of making a product that
somebody wants
well then i think paul graham's point
makes a lot of sense like the being
useful and giving them something they
want
ends up being pretty much the same thing
but here's where i disagree a little bit
and i'm not sure if my thinking is clear
on this yet
i feel like what you focus on makes a
difference
even if you say well you know
the outcome is going to look about the
same i don't know
i think what you focus on makes a
difference for the
gray areas of which you would expect
money
i think if you focus on being useful
you're always going to win
but if you focus on giving people what
they want
sometimes they don't know what they want
you know what i mean
useful being useful is a little bit more
objective
okay this is useful
or not this is more useful than that you
could usually kind of suss that out what
is more useful than something else
but i don't know if you can deal with
what people want
people's wants are not necessarily
tethered to what they need or what's
good for them or they even know
how it's going to turn out they've got
short-term wants that
that are in conflict with their
long-term needs right
so i feel as if focusing on anybody's
wants
is going to give you some problems
sometimes
the difference is mind-reading maybe
all right
uh apparently there's a class-action
suit against the candy skittles
because there's some ingredient in there
titanium dioxide that i think in europe
it's already banned and
there's there's some indication that it
might not be good for you
but when i saw this i thought you know i
don't have too much of a thought about
skittles
because i have a rule
i i don't eat things which don't
don't seem to have any food in them
so that's just my rule
if you're putting something in your
mouth and
digesting it
and it doesn't have any
food related
quality that you can determine
well i feel like you're
you're really asking for trouble there
probably just food and medicine is the
only thing you should put in your mouth
okay you've got a dirty mind
go ahead make your dirty jokes
okay we're done
but otherwise the only thing you should
put in your mouth is food medicine
and dirty stuff
and naughty stuff
um but
this brings me to my macro point
uh our foods are food supply
um not just maybe it's more the united
states or the industrialized countries
but let me tell you something that's
really really obvious
in america
i i want to see if there's anybody
who'll disagree with the following
statement
our food supply
is poison
you just look around
people
just look around
just go to the mall
and just look around
and you tell me our food supply is not
 poisoned it's obvious
it's obvious and and somehow the food
industry got away with blaming us
think about that
the food business
is getting away with blaming us for
being unhealthy because we
ate the wrong food
i don't think so
if if you're selling you know crack to
children
i don't think it's the children's fault
if they get addicted is it
if you sell crack to children it's your
 fault
it's not the children's fault and in
this analogy we adults are the children
we don't know any better you give me a
 french fry i'm gonna put it in
my mouth
right do i know that eating french fries
is not my optimal health related thing
oh i do
i do but if you put a basket of fries in
front of me
do you know what i'm going to say in
about a second and a half
well one basket of fries doesn't hurt me
right i'm gonna rationalize it in a
heartbeat
because they're really delicious
we don't have a chance
this food is engineered to overwhelm our
our whatever you think is your willpower
which is an illusion
so you're really you're operating
against something that's scientifically
designed to be you
if you're fighting every day against a
a let's say a an enemy who is
scientifically designed to beat you
every time
well don't be surprised if you lose
because it was scientifically designed
to beat you every time that's that's the
sugar fat salt combination if you
manipulate the sugar fat salt which is
the name of a book you should read
it's addictive
right there's a reason you can only you
can't eat more than one potato chip
right that's real
i really can't eat one
i've tried have you ever tried to eat
one potato chip
if you're all alone
and you keep the potato chips in your
room and you're still hungry
you you just can't do it
i i would say that on the
if you were to rank me
against you know other human beings in
terms of willpower i think it'd be
pretty high up there
like i would say my track record of life
suggests that i can
put off pleasure for a long time to get
some larger gain i have pretty high
emotional
intelligence as you know objectively
measured
but i can't resist the second second
potato chip
that's crazy i will just talk myself
into an rv
so
um i think we have to come to
some kind of a
realization or awareness
our food supply is killing us
it's not even close to adequate it's not
even close
it's not even in the general zip code
of food
have you ever met somebody who ate clean
like really clean
now you you think you have because you
you have a friend who's a vegan or
something like that no i'm not even
close
the difference between eating clean like
really eating clean no additives no
preservatives all that stuff
if you meet one of those people
they're not like you are they
they're not like you
their their bodies and their health is
really different and it's very
noticeable yeah i once i once uh
briefly dated a woman who was this just
the cleanest eater and didn't use any
like unnatural shampoos or you know
didn't even put things on externally
and
it was so obvious
that that human being was operating at a
different level of health
it was just really obvious and i don't
think i don't think she started as the
healthiest person in the world i think
it's what she eats i think it's just
that now i couldn't i couldn't do what
she did it was just too extreme it was
just really extreme
but
no question it worked no question that
worked
all political movements of any scale are
fake
in terms of protests you know like big
movements
whether it's your antifa's or your
january 6 events or your
or you're fine people marches or you're
antifa
um
i think they're all fake
and here's what i mean
i don't mean that the individuals who
are marching don't have sincere feelings
they do
but they wouldn't be there
except that
some artificial entity funded it and
organized it right now here's the
thinking
you could imagine a time in the 70s i
don't know if it's true but you can
imagine a time
when maybe spontaneous
large-scale protests did happen
right maybe
but probably not even then and here's
the reason
it's that the organizers have too much
to gain
they can monetize it
if it's possible to monetize leadership
of an organization
well you're down here right follow the
money
what what's going to happen if it's
possible just if it's possible
to monetize leadership of a
political movement
somebody's going to buy it
right there's somebody who's going to
buy your loyalty because the cat is for
sale
you can monetize it now
without going into a log argument here's
the short version
if you follow the money
it has to be in the long run
that all major uh
organized political movements are all
artificial in other words somebody just
funded them to look like a grassroots
movement but it's the organizers that
are getting everybody spun up
in the long run
they all become owned by a bad entity
because they're all for sale
ultimately
in the short run maybe not in the short
run you can imagine people spontaneously
running into the street to protest
something and i think maybe the abortion
situation on day one
was probably just organic right on day
one probably just people just said oh
 they just got up and made a sign
and walked outside
but
wait a little while
whoever has the most money and influence
will eventually
get to whoever the organic leaders are
and say you know you're doing well as an
organic leader but you're not making any
money you're not paying your family
you're not feeding your family how about
i give you a bunch of money make you
much more effective
they say yeah
you're on my side
i mean what's there's no downside right
i just get more money and i do the same
thing
but people give you money on you
no matter what your original motivation
was as soon as you start taking money
you got a boss
right so basically every leader who
might be
organic in the beginning
ends up getting owned by somebody who
has enough money to do that
so
i can't see any situation
in which a large-scale protest on either
side
for any reason
would ever be organic in the long run
i just can't see it so i from this point
on i assume all large protests are fake
a little bit doesn't mean the people the
people might be very sincere but in
terms of what got them all there
probably always fake from now on
i don't think we live in a world in
which it it can't rapidly go fake
because follow the money
the money will always be there there's
always going to be somebody on that side
even if there's nobody in the united
states who wants this protest
there's always china
there's always some there's always
another country that wants some trouble
here
so you can always get it funded
npr has launched a what they call a
disinformation reporting team
so a group of people who will tell you
what's true and what isn't
here is uh what i invented today i call
it the adams law effect fact checkers
the adams law of fact checkers and it
goes like this
all fact-checking organizations are
liars by omission
and it isn't fixable
all fact check organizations are liars
by omission
that's their job
their job is to lie by omission
if you don't know that's the real
mission
so the job of a fact checker is to say
well obviously there are too many things
in the world
you can't look at every every fact and
try to check it right so you have to
pick ones
what happens when the fact checkers pick
the facts
to fact check
well they're not going to pick the one
that's bad for their team
so they just lie by omission
they simply leave out a fact check
because it would be inconvenient to have
one and then when you look for the fact
check it as well nothing there
so
and if you've read any of the fact
checks so far
the ones that are obviously fake fact
checks and you you know which ones i
mean right
you've seen it yourself there are ones
that are just obviously fake fact checks
um
you can tell what they left out
you just look at it you go well
you know you've left out like a main
variable you haven't even ruled on it
like you've just ignored a main variable
that's a lie
if your fact checking
ignores what is obviously a major
variable in the decision
that's a lie by omission
so in the long run i don't think they
can go in any other direction
so all political organizations become
you know corrupted eventually
by money
and all fact checkers eventually become
liars by omission now i don't think that
they usually lie
directly
there might be a case of that but i
think that would be rare you don't see
the fact checker say oh this happened on
this date when it didn't
like that the fact checking tends to be
right
but they lie by leaving out other facts
right if there's a fact that the other
side just don't mention it
there you go
so do you think that the fact checkers
could ever act independently
they're not even it's not even designed
to do that
do you think that they look for the most
independent fact checkers to form the
you know do you think npr said you know
we are a left-leaning organization
but for fact checking that's exactly the
kind of bias you want to get rid of
so rather than just maybe promoting our
obviously left-leaning people into a job
of trust and fact-checking we're going
to scour the world
and find people who are famous for being
able to
disagree with their own team
that's the people you want with your
fact checkers because that's people who
have a track record that says i don't
care if my team says this is true it's
just not true
and then they hired those people who
could go against the grain because
that's who you could trust
no
nothing like that's happening
they're hiring leftists
and what do you think the leftists would
do if they got a situation in which
let's say for hypothetically
let's say there was a left leading
person who legitimately wanted to do
fact checking
and let's say this left-leaning person
said you know i'm going to seriously try
to be objective here i know i'm
left-leaning
but i'm being hired to be objective i'm
going to be objective and let's say some
facts came to that person
they showed that the fine people hoax
was a hoax and maybe it's the first time
they heard it
do you think a left leading person
working for npr
even if they believed it true and
discovered that the fine people hoax was
in fact a hoax you know the the
the hoax part is just that
trump called neo-nazis fine people which
we know didn't happen because of the
video
but
imagine if you were you had a uh impulse
to debunk that
could you do it
no
no
you couldn't do it
and not and keep your job
do you think do you think even if
somebody thought it thought they had the
facts do you think they could debunk a
major left talking point and then keep
their job not a chance
not a chance they wouldn't be able to go
to a party
imagine going to a party after you
debunked the left's whatever biggest
talking point couldn't do it
you wouldn't be it would be like alan
dershowitz being you know expelled from
uh
from polite company
so by their designs fact checker
organizations can't work if they come
out of organizations that have a bias
or even if you just live in the world
you can't be by unbiased about fact
checking
all right so we saw another robot that
is getting close to looking like people
nobody has
yet solved for making a robot actually
look like a person but they're getting
closer and closer
what happens when you can't tell the
difference
because that that feels like
that's going to happen at least on video
right if you just zoom call to a robot
someday you won't know the difference
and how would you know the difference
and i have this
suggestion
that the way you can spot a robot in the
future is the same way you could spot an
npc today
if in fact npcs exist which it appears
they do
it appears they do doesn't mean they do
and that is that npcs and robots won't
have stories
they won't have stories
so yesterday i was doing a little video
from my man cave live stream
and i was challenging people to
prompt me to tell a story
and so there were things like what was
your most embarrassing moment or you
know what what was the moment that you
realized this or that and for each of
those
i had a story
i go well let me tell you the story how
i felt and
blah blah the surprise ending
and i have lots of stories
but there are definitely people who
can't tell you a story about anything
that happened to them and i think robots
in the short run
a robot won't be able to tell you a
story
if you talk to a robot about what's
happening at the moment well maybe you
can't tell the difference
but if you say to the robot hey
can you tell me a story about like the
best thing you ever got for your
birthday
you're done
you know now could you program a robot
to fool you
about its own biography like maybe a
steals from somebody else's backstory
probably so you could definitely get a
robot to fool you but that leads me to
my next
observation
we really need a law
that if something is ai or a robot it
got it's got to be labeled
right we do truth and labeling
you've got to label those robots
if you come at me with a robot
pretending to be human and i can't tell
the difference you and i have a problem
all right don't send don't send your
robot at me
and try to make me think it's human
if you do that you and i have a problem
you you have you have done something to
me that's immoral
and unethical
you made me think that a robot was a
human being and then maybe i interacted
with it or made decisions based on it
no bueno
that needs to be flat illegal
and
the voice as well
we need to have a law that says
ai voices cannot be modulated outside a
certain parameter
in other words we can't let ai be
persuasive
not by voice
you can't let ai
persuade you with a human-like voice
that's got to be illegal and we got to
do it now because the the first ai with
a human voice you know that's persuasive
and maybe even can modulate the voice
and change it that is too dangerous
and we know it's dangerous
like you don't have to wonder about it
is there anybody here who would doubt
the the proposition that an ai that
sounded like a human enough that you
couldn't tell
and also could change its voice quality
to be more persuasive or less persuasive
you don't want that loose in the
world
you do not want that loose in the world
believe me it's bad enough that i'm
loose in the world
this is my favorite category of things
to say
one of my categories is things which
cannot be communicated
they're easy concepts but for whatever
reason you can't tell somebody like the
boy who cried wolf
right the boy who cried wolf cannot
communicate that there's an actual wolf
he can say the words but it can't be
communicated because you already believe
that he lies about wolves so
there's no way to get from here there
but but here's what i like to say sort
of in that genre
if anybody knew what i could actually do
i would be murdered
it would be too it would be too
dangerous to have me loosen society
but the only reason that that i'm
completely safe
is that nobody has any idea
nobody has any idea
what i can accomplish through persuasion
if you did
i'd be in jail
because you just wouldn't want it'd be
like having a nuclear bomb wandering
around
without government control
that's sort of what i am
but i will always be free because nobody
will ever believe
what i could actually do
now what i can do might be only a
fraction of what an ai could do
eventually
persuasion-wise because it would have
all the tools instantly
it could it could quickly check those
tools against the individual and
basically everything i do the slow human
way
is programmable
it's all and better
in fact the ai will be better at
detecting your micro changes than even i
am
and i'm trained to do it
one of the big
one of the big skills of a hypnotist
is not what you say
but it's observing how what you said
influenced the person
and there's a look
there's a look that people present and
hypnotists can tell you this
when they're in a certain mode
right when their mind is entered i know
like a maintenance mode or something
you can see it
now it's easy to recognize if you have
experience it would be impossible to
recognize if you didn't but an a i could
do it right away
you would just have to give it okay
here's here's 10 pictures of people in
that mode you know that mental mode
here's 10 people not
done
the ai would be able to spot it every
day after that you know i'm simplifying
but that's the basic idea
all right
so yes let's get some laws about uh
robots and ai pretending to be people
that needs to be stopped
right away
because the first one is going to be
like a nuclear weapon
you got to stop it right away
do you know how many uh
um social media followers
the first robot that's indistinguishable
from a human would have
as many as it wanted
as many as it wanted
all right um let's do the january 6 hoax
update
um i can't call the january 6th thing
like anything but a hoax anymore because
i i feel at this point is just so
 obvious
somebody says for 9.99
for a super chat it's funny because the
chat influences scott more than the
influence then he influences the chat
it's definitely a two-way street
um you definitely influenced me
that i didn't know
you often fill in contacts but you do
also actually fact check
yeah um i'm definitely influenced
factually
but the
um
the
the nature of the uh technology
is that maybe i guess i'm like group
peer influence or something like that
but generally speaking this is not an
influential
uh platform in two directions
it's influential in my direction because
you can see me and hear me
but i've just got text to look at so
that that that handicaps you quite a bit
compared to
the persuasion that i can apply
but anyway
um
so
here's the thing that was bothering me
yesterday so we heard a report that one
of the january 6 protesters
is going to get a maybe 15 years
for a list of charges that didn't look
to me like a 15-year sentence
but i guess they're all these um
what do they call them
um
will you put on top of the charge
they're like
stimulants to the charge
they're extras what's the word
enhancements yeah so the judge can add
these quote enhancements to the
um
to the sentence
and say oh because of this or that it's
extra bad
now here's the problem
in order for the democrats
to sell the january 6 hoax
there's one thing that has to happen
really long jail terms
for at least some of the protesters am i
right
they really can't sell the hoax
unless these people go to jail for a
long time
these people should be freed immediately
they should be freed
immediately
irrespective of the crimes they
committed
let me say it again and i would say this
if they were democrats right
this is not team play well it is team
play it's team america
this is this is america
in america
we do not
we do not
we do not
in america
if we if we want to stay america
like if you really want to be america
we do not
set our
length of sentence
based on what the democrats need
politically
we do not
this is happening right in front of you
right in front of you it's very obvious
that these are going to be long
sentences because if they if they were
dismissed
what would the january six hearings look
like if while they were happening
the people accused were getting
dismissed without charges what would
that look like
it would look like the january 6th thing
was
because it is mostly i mean you know
let me say the obvious thing in case
there's any npcs watching this is just
for the npcs right smart people you can
ignore this the real humans
but the npcs are going to say well what
you're ignoring the actual violence of
the people
no i'm not
no i'm not
there's nobody in the world who thinks
actually violent people
should not be you know dealt with by the
legal process nobody so
the npcs if you're watching
oh you're forgetting the violence no i'm
not
no
but
uh we're not america if there uh if if
we can watch
without acting
um american citizens who did make some
mistakes
right no i'm not going to whitewash
any of their actions that's that's up to
them right their actions are just for
them to deal with here's what i have to
deal with
america
right yeah my problem is america
and america is a little bit broken right
now and it's broken right in front of us
and what do we do
what do americans do
when something's broken
and it's right in front of you
you fix it
there's only one way to fix this
you got to vote the democrats out
because at least you can pardon people
or whatever the hell you're going to do
right
[Music]
if if there were no other um
well actually
let me make a stand
i'm going to make a stand right now
no matter who the republican well it
could be even the democrat but no matter
which candidate says i'm going to pardon
all the january 6 protesters
has my support
and i'll even change my opinion if trump
runs and says i'll just do that one
thing
he has my full support
i don't think he should be running
because he's too old
i don't think anybody should run at that
age
but if he runs
and if he says you know i got all these
other ideas but i'll tell you one thing
i'm going to do
is i'm going to fix this problem of
people being sentenced based on democrat
political needs
i'm just going to fix that
and
this is so important
that i could be a single i could be a
single issue voter over this i could
also be single issue voter over um
fentanyl
if a candidate said
uh i got i got some other
policies you might like them you might
not but i'm gonna drop a drone on the
cartels every time every time fentanyl
comes into this country i'm going to
make one
for every death i'll send a rocket
for every fentanyl death we'll send one
drone to blow up some in a cartel
area
every time
if you kill a hundred thousand americans
we'll send a hundred thousand
uh missiles into
mexico one missile for one death or
something like that i'm just making that
up
but if we had a candidate who said you
know i'm just going to solve this one
problem and i don't care if i have to
invade mexico to do it and by the way
i would support a candidate who said he
would invade mexico
let me say that directly
i'm in favor of invading mexico
militarily
just to say directly
i'm in favor of militarily invading
mexico because it's not really a
government government it's a it's a
narco government
they're they're taking a hundred
thousand
of our people
if trump's if trump ran for president on
invading mexico i'd vote for him
now if mexico wanted to do something
about it to avoid being invaded
they should do that right away
i'd even help them do it
help them fund it
give them some resources you know let
them do what they can to become an
independent
strong ally but at the moment i would
support a candidate who said invade
mexico militarily
absolutely in a heartbeat
i wouldn't even hesitate
so those are my big issues
freeing the january 6 people who are
overcharged again we're not we're not
forgiving any real crimes they're just
obviously overcharged
for democrat political purposes it's
just obvious you can't do this right in
front of us
right
it's like
it's one thing
to americans like privately and i
don't hear about it but if you do it
right in front of me
i'm not i'm not gonna let you
americans right in front of me
right that's that's going to be noticed
here's the other story that i don't know
it's just amazing what the public can be
sold
and i saw
kyle becker was
responding the same way i would have so
there's a story now and i need a fact
check on this can somebody verify this
is really true so i heard it from one
source on twitter so
you know use your judgment
but apparently there's a story that uh
clinton campaign lawyer michael sussman
um who
allegedly ran three four fraudulent
operations against trump in 2016-17
traveled to london
and met with with uh you know spies and
stuff
at the british spy center gchq
and the british eavesdropping agency
that provided materials to cia chief
john brennan so we know that
that john brennan said he or did get
some stuff
from britain
we know that christopher steele was a
ex-british intelligence officer
and we were sold
on the concept that there's such a thing
as an
ex-british intelligence officer or a
professional
do you think there's such a thing as an
ex-british
intelligence person
no no now i believe he's not on the
payroll
i believe he's not on the payroll
but that's not like being an ex
do you think that he could do something
that his his masters didn't like
no i mean not and hope to have a
relationship with him in the future
which i'm sure was valuable to him
so
we we never say directly
that it's obvious that great britain was
involved in the russia collusion hoax if
not completely behind it
with hillary clinton
but why do we act like it's not it's not
there
it's right there
christopher steele
was an xx
british spy
why don't we call it
british interference
it's just crazy that we just we all
agree that it's russian interference
when when the actual reporting is
british interference
we're looking right at it
the news has reached a point where they
can put it right in front of you and
tell you it's not there
right here here's here's all the brits
you know being behind this russia
collusion thing
but it was russia here's all the
evidence it was really great britain now
let's talk about russia
and we can actually do that
like right in front of you
all of the information is right there
it's obvious great britain was involved
in some level
obvious
but we just act like it's not true
all right
um san francisco
is trying to i guess the mayor is behind
this they've got a proposal in which the
police would be able to continuously
monitor
um neighborhoods and cities
through your personal
security
system
what
that's right if you have a ring camera
that's connected to a network
the san francisco police there's this is
a proposal would like to at any time
they want
look through your camera
total access to it at any time
and see what you would see if you were
standing on your front porch and the
idea is that once i had access to all
this
surveillance
yeah what about your indoor cameras you
ask
quite reasonably
quite reasonably
and do you think the police would misuse
this ability to see what's happening in
your house
of course
[Laughter]
of course
somehow
of course
yeah
and don't you think they could tell when
you're home
yeah the police will know in your home
do you want the police to know in your
home now i'm a big supporter of the
police
love the police
it is however a fact
that there's not much difference between
a police officer and a criminal
now there's an important difference
which is one is on the side of the law
and one is not
but in terms of their personalities not
that different
you know the ability to
do dangerous things
for benefit
for really not that much benefit
you know if you assume they're underpaid
which i assume
so
i don't know
if you said what is a group of people
you at least want to know
if you're home number one would be
criminals right
the number one people you you want to
know you don't want to know if you're
home
or not is criminals but what is the
number two organization
the second
group that you would most not want to
know about what's happening around your
home
isn't that the police
and it's the police because i wouldn't
trust them
not not because they'd see my private
stuff which is a good enough reason
somebody says my wife yeah your ex-wife
do you think anybody will be a police
officer with access to the system
who also has an ex
who has that system
imagine the police officers being able
to see their ex-wife
or husband
and they and their new lover
you know visiting the house
do you want any of that
that the the amount of uh intrusion into
your personal life is just through the
roof
now here's something that i would i
would uh
be okay with
if if the police said
optionally if you want to put a separate
camera system in front of your house and
give us access to it but it's your
choice
it's got to be a specific kind where we
can't get to any of your other cameras
or anything so it's got to be you know
walled off system if you'd like to have
that kind of a system
and you agree
then we'll be able to look at it but you
have to agree
and you have to know exactly what they
have access to and what they don't
i
i could ima i could imagine
i could imagine
having a ring doorbell let's just say
and let's say if ring could somehow wall
off its software so that you know
the police could only look through the
front door if you've got other cameras
somewhere
could you imagine labeling it
law enforcement monitored
that would be better wouldn't it
like if you were worried about your own
security and you had a ring camera
that's good
but if you had a ring camera that you
knew the police could look at in real
time
that's a little scarier
right as long as everything you did was
voluntary
that's a different situation but
if they're going to force this
uh
no i don't think it can get approved do
you do you think there's any way that
could get approved
if if the resident
doesn't you think there is
i mean maybe
maybe
it seems like a long shot
but maybe
all right
i could tell you when the ukraine russia
war will end if you could give me the
following information
and i know you can't but
maybe someday somebody can
it goes like this how quickly can russia
find and spin up new ammo warehouses
right because their ammo warehouses are
being targeted for destruction by
ukraine
who now has new accurate long-range
weapons to get to all their ammo depots
and if their ammo depots were beyond
that range they also wouldn't be useful
right so now ukraine looks like they can
get to any useful
ammo dumps that that russia would have
on russia's side of the territory now
the question is this we have x many
missiles and rocket launchers that can
do that level of accuracy
is it that what's the name of them the
h-i-m-a-s or something there's a
specific type of weapon so they're being
shipped to ukraine and i think they have
nine high mars
h-i-m-a-r-s
so i think ukraine has nine of them
people are saying can we get a hundred
now
um
carried a gun in the capitol and he
threatened to kill his family if they
turned him
they turned him in all right
um
so so the warning there was that the uh
the person who is overcharged at the
capitol there was some extenuating
situation there
maybe right but but in general the
overcharging in general there there will
be specific cases where where there's a
real argument there
all right we're getting back to my point
um
how many rockets can a
high mars one highmar system send per
day
could could they send a hundred rockets
per day
what do you think
230.
they could do they could do at least
dozens right
now how how fast can the russians build
ammo warehouses
as they're being destroyed now i'm
making an assumption here that we're
always going to know where they are
because we have eyes in the sky and
we've got probably just tons of you know
local intel because remember russia is
occupying an area in which not everybody
being occupied is happy about it
so in theory
the locals should be plenty happy to say
you know i saw some ammo trucks heading
into that building
so i feel like we would always know
where they are
and i would also say that russia's
military capability would basically
disappear if their ammo did
right now everybody adjusts maybe they'd
threaten with nukes or something so we
don't know what would happen
but in theory
the number of hymar missiles
blowing up a number of ammo depots if
you have enough missiles and you know
the number of missiles is increasing as
they're getting more of them
and the rate at which
russia can replace them
at some point will be lower
than the rate at which they can be
destroyed
as soon as that becomes a permanent
situation which seems very likely
the war is over
i feel like i feel like we now know what
it looks like
now of course
anything could be wrong right predicting
predicting war
is sort of silly
because it's always based on surprises
and adjustments and you know things you
don't see coming and the fog of war and
who knows if anything we've heard about
the war is even true at this point
so
but it does seem to me
that the number of high mars compared to
how rapidly russia can build new depots
that are functional
i think it's down to that right
am i right it's down to that and what
appears to be what is going to happen
is that russia will
start to think that they're lucky if
they can keep what they've got
and they'll make a deal that doesn't
make them happy at the same time the
ukrainians will make a deal that makes
them very unhappy too which is a good
deal makes everybody unhappy
um
somebody asked if i was registered to
vote the answer is i don't remember if
i'm registered
do you register once or do you register
every time you move how does that work
but but i don't vote
i'm not i'm not registered as a
republican or well i take that back
i might be registered to something
i don't remember
if i registered as either a democrat or
republican
it wouldn't have meant anything to me it
would not have been an indication of who
i was going to vote for
i probably said independent wouldn't
because i have registered in the past
i don't know if i'm registered at the
moment
and i i don't have a plan to vote
the reason i don't vote is different
from your reasons it's because i do this
publicly
i don't think you should vote
if you're going to try to be objective
about anything right now it's hard
enough to be objective about anything
and i don't think i hit that standard i
wish i did
but
uh for me
there would be a bias that would occur
if i voted
that would increase whatever bias i'm
already operating under and and
struggling against
right the rest of you you should vote
i recommend it
if you're talking in public about
politics
at least give a thought to not voting
right i wouldn't want you to give up
your right to vote if it makes you feel
good go ahead and do it but just be
aware
that casting an actual vote like acting
with your body
makes it really really hard later to say
that you made a mistake
right
if i tell you i think this candidate's
better than another one then it turns
out i'm wrong
well it's going to be hard for me to say
i was wrong
but at least i didn't vote for him
do you see it now
well okay that candidate i was pretty
sure would be the good one turned down
poorly
but at least i didn't vote for him
do you get it
that would make me more biased
there's no way i would act the same if i
had voted for him
right if i voted for him i'd feel like i
had to defend it to the death even
though logically i shouldn't
um revolver has a article
basically mocking the new york times
coverage of the ray epps situation so
y'all know ray apps was caught on camera
inciting protesters to go into the
capital on january 6. and he seemed to
be
if not the most vocal organizer
certainly one of them
i think the most right
in terms of going inside the capitol i
think he was the most uh vocal i think
he had a megaphone and everything else
did he not
and fact-check me on that did he have a
megaphone
i i think i may have just imagined that
right
somebody says yes or are you i'm seeing
yeses and knows
yeah isn't that interesting so so
some of us have faith false memories
and it might be me
yeah i think i've conflated him with
other people there there was a megaphone
person there but i don't know if it was
him anyway we won't settle this right
away but it doesn't matter
and here's other things that the
revolver story says
about the new york times wrote what too
many of us
our impression is
that the new york times was trying to
cover
for some intelligence agency
and and run a cover story that would
make their um operative allegedly
looked like he was just an innocent
citizen
so it looks too many of us can't prove
it but it looks like the new york times
is just working for an intelligence
agency to write a fake story about
rayapps to cover their tracks that's
what it looks like now do i believe
that's what happened i don't know
but the new york times has been
incredibly accused
and proven to be you know
untrustworthy on a number of topics of
great interest to the public
from weapons of mass destruction and you
know you name it russia collusion
i mean they have they have a long record
of clearly
backing fake news clearly
so when they say ray epps is just a
citizen and there's nothing to worry
about here
do we believe them
well i will tell you that just this week
my my famous democrat friend who i
mentioned anonymously
a smart person that i often have
conversations with about politics or i
have in the past
and he told me
in the context of some other
conversation it didn't have anything to
do with january 6. i don't think but he
told me that it was in the new york
times and therefore you know it was
reliable and i thought
what
what
in 2022 how could you possibly say that
in 2022 there's a like an adult
human who pays attention who believes
that because it was in the new york
times
that makes it very likely to be true
i'm not 100 percent nothing's 100
but very likely to be true because with
the new york times
to which i say well if you've been alive
for the last five years
you would know that if it's a political
story
that favors one side or the other
it's not going to be true
it's you know maybe facts and dates are
true
but the political spin
i don't think anybody expects that to be
true
let's spin like everything else
um
so here's what uh here's some quotes
from the revolver article you can see it
in my my twitter feed i tweeted it
uh the only problem is that reyes didn't
go to trump's speech
so
apparently there's evidence that he
planned
the protest like he had advanced
advanced planning and we know that that
he would be part of the protest he went
all the way to washington
and did not attend the speech
trump's speech he went directly to the
capitol where he immediately started
organizing them to go in which
apparently he talked about in advance
with somebody
all right
so the guy who went there innocently
didn't even go there for the reason
that people went there
he had a different agenda all right
um
and uh it says quote the revolver piece
says the times piece attempts to wave
off epps january 6th protest
participation
as negligible
similar to those who committed minor
offenses and weren't charged
yet epps is the key person caught on
video with an advanced plan to go into
the capital
he's the primary person on video
organizing people to go into the capitol
and we know he had an advanced plan to
do it
and he's being treated like
people who trespassed
there's there's no correlation that's
not just a person who trespassed
that's somebody with a plan
um
and
and even the new york times
who dismisses the the conspiracy
theories about rey apps this is
according to revolver as well
refers to apps in its own definitive
video documentary so this is new york
times against new york times they refer
to him as a rioter for whom storming the
capital was part of the pala all along
so the original new york times reporting
was that he's obviously a key member of
the plot and and he was you know planned
to go into the capitol all along so new
york times says has said this directly
into reporting and now they're reporting
that he was basically a minor person
like other people who were released
and then
according to the revolver this this is
more opinionated i think
that the new york times
uh ominously suggests epps will sue news
outlets for defamation
if they keep saying things about him
so doesn't this look exactly like the
new york times is doing a cover piece
for an intelligence agency
not that they are
that's something i can't confirm
but it looks exactly like it
i know unless there's something i'm
missing
um
here's the most interesting part
revolver asks this
i wonder if the author of the new york
times piece alan fewer
could clarify for the record
did he ask apps if he had the
association within the intelligence
agencies or cutouts of such agencies if
so
what did he say
if not why not and i read this and i
thought
wait a minute
the new york times did an article on the
topic of whether
ray epps
was
working for an intelligence agency that
was the point of the piece
and they didn't ask him if he did
or if they did ask him they didn't
report his answer
that being the only point
and they interviewed him
and they didn't ask him if he's part of
an intelligence agency
the only question that mattered
now here's the funny part
if revolver had not helpfully pointed
out that he hadn't asked the question
i don't know if i would have noticed
would you have noticed
if you read a whole article about how he
definitely totally wasn't
an intelligence operator just a normal
person would you have noticed
that they never asked them the question
and then reported the answer
i don't know if i would
i think that that is so clever
that i would not have noticed
now revolver has more of a
an interest in this because they
reported on reps so they're you know
they're also defending their own
reporting
but so they looked a little closer and
they noticed and i didn't even notice
that
did any of you know that that the new
york times did that article and didn't
and didn't report on whether they asked
them if he was a member of an
intelligence organization
no we didn't notice that didn't we think
about that oh you didn't notice
all right somebody said says they
noticed good for you
all right
apparently a federal judge blocked
the biden administration
from some kind of ruling that would
allow transgender
students to use the same restrooms as
their identification
but also to allow transgender to join
sports teams corresponding with their
chosen genders
and the federal judge has blocked it
now
um i would like to reframe this again
um i think we have to look at the sports
as what's broken and not the athletes
and every time that we look at the
athlete as is the athlete good you know
is that fair for them to do what they're
doing or is there something wrong with
the athlete
every time we're focusing on the athlete
we're just looking in the wrong
direction there's something wrong with
how we organize sports that this is even
a question
why in the world are people not playing
against people of equal ability
when was that okay
why is it okay that you're you're
awkward
kid who's not good at sports
has to go to a school in which only the
gifted physically
capable people get to be heroes and you
know they get to be lauded for their
accomplishments and they get all the
boys and the girls and all that
why is that fair
why is it fair that people of lower
ability don't get to play on an
organized sport
in high school at least the ones with
prestige they can play unorganized
sports
or lesser organized sports
so i feel like we should just scrap the
whole thing
and say how about people who have
roughly equal abilities play each other
right if you've got a high school and
the high school team you're playing
against has shaquille o'neal you know
young shaquille on the other team
is that fair should you even have a game
what would be the point of playing
let's say you're your tallest guy in
your team was 6'1
and you're playing against you know
shaquille o'neal's team in high school
are you going to win
no because you kill for whatever reason
he's not like you
he's not like anybody else so what would
be even the point of playing those games
it's like it's like what's the point of
swimming against you know leah thomas if
you're a woman what's the point
because you know how it's going to turn
out
so we don't have a problem of just you
know trans on sports
we have a problem with wildly
uh out of the norm athletes
playing on sports
the problem is athletes that are way out
of the normal playing on the wrong team
and the wrong team in this case just
means ability it doesn't mean gender
why in the world do we care the gender
of who's on the team
now the whole idea that women need to
get
awards
it's just a woman thing
sorry
because if it worked the other way it
probably you wouldn't see any change if
women had always been the athletes
you know this is true if women had
traditionally been the only ones who
played sports
and and socially we had adjusted to that
you know to a time we adjusted that was
right
but then we got more aware and said hey
men are playing sports
how about get some men into these sports
do you think anybody would give a
no
nobody would give a if if sports
had always been about women and men
wanted to get it no but nobody would
change the law for that
of course not it's only because men were
you know and boys were playing sports
unfairly i'm not saying that was a good
deal it was very unfair for the women
but the reason it changed
is because there was women asking for it
i don't think it works the other way
and i don't think that it was ever a
good change
because what women ask for is hey can't
women get their own awards
to which i say well why can't shitty
male athletes get their own
awards why isn't there a varsity team
for a short basketball with short male
basketball players
why is that wrong
why is there not a varsity
male basketball team for people under
five eight
why can't why can't they win an award
well you say well scott
they're just
bad athletes
you don't give awards to bad athletes
for whatever the reason you're sure
they're 5-8 but
you know you want to reward the good
athletes
to which i say
but i wasn't born where i can compete
with shaquille o'neal
look at me
what uh am i gonna stop is dunk
so why in the world
should i let's say hypothetically i had
no
sporting ability
why should i be like you know glorifying
the people who were good at a random
event
sports are completely random rules
and and i as a person who just you know
wouldn't be good at some of those sports
i i have to go glorify and my tax you
know some of my tax base goes to support
their awesomeness
you know why am i paying for some
athlete that i'm not
so first you got to figure out how we
got here
how we got here
is that women complained i would have
too
perfectly reasonable
and they worked to get you know sort of
equal treatment
but it wasn't what they should have
asked for
they got what they asked for but it's
not what they should have asked for
it was good for good for girls and good
for women so i can't fault them for
asking for what's good for them that's
the way it works you do get to ask her
for what's good for you
i'm not going to criticize people asking
for what's good for them
but if we had re-architected the whole
thing from scratch we would have said
you know
that's a good point
uh maybe we should just have teams that
are based on ability and
the the best female players who are on
teams mostly with men
would still be superstars
wouldn't they
could you imagine if
a female made it onto a
high-end team in which the only other
people who could play for that team were
male
wouldn't that one woman who could
actually legitimately make the team
be like really it'd be danica patrick
right
danica patrick probably made more money
than 99 of all male race car drivers why
because she was interesting
she was interested she was pretty that
helped but she was interesting because
she was the highest level
female in a largely male dominated sport
what's wrong with that model
do you think danica
patrick thinks oh
i've been so discriminated against in
this male sport or does she think that
she is world famous and has a you know
great opportunities
because of it
i know
um
so
really the trans the trans topic has
everything to do with the fact that
women are treated as a little bit more
special than men and we've agreed that
that's just
we're okay with that
and then the trans thing just messes up
the whole model
just messes up the whole model
but
i'm going to leave you that with this
one thought that i'm not going to change
you'll never talk me out of this
the trans are not broken
trans people are not broken
sports are broken
just fix the sports i know it's not
going to happen
i'm just saying look in the right place
for the problem you're it's not the
trans people
all right
[Music]
so you know the who was it the
trump's secret service people
testified for the january six people
and
uh here's an interesting fact that you
would never notice
if if i were not here to bring it up
you know i always notice i always
mentioned when
cnn runs a opinion piece
often by chris silessa seliza i hope i'm
saying that right
and he's one of their superstar opinion
people and he'll do
a story this sort of anti-republican by
its nature
and does a good job
um and there's a couple others uh
um collinson i think is the other one
who are their their standard go to i
think they have
like three or four
big name opinion pieces who always jump
in when you need to rescue a democrat
problem
right if there's something in the news
that's skewed a little bit too
republican
you know one of their big names jumps in
and squashes it down
well i noticed with interest and maybe
it could be just
summer vacations or something
but they've got a what i think is an
unknown at least to me somebody named
jeremy erb
who writes the opinion piece to say that
the house january 6 committee
corroborated
key details involving former president
trump's
heated exchange with secret service when
trump was told he could not go to the
capitol
okay
so
so the they corroborated key details
about that exchange let me think what
did that story include let's say there
was a there's a story about him throwing
food against a wall which he denies
there's a story about trump allegedly
grabbing the steering wheel of the
the car he was in to try to you know
encourage the driver to go toward the
protests
and
but yet the reporting
by jeremy erb
is that
the key details were corroborated
what do you think were the key details
which part was corroborated
you see what's missing
here's a fact that was corroborated
here's another fact that was
corroborated here's the fact here's the
corroboration
it doesn't have that
it just says that key things were
corroborated
were the key things the actual things
that you think are the key
because i think if trump grabbed the
steering wheel of a moving car
that would be i'd like to know that
did did he say that happened i don't
think so
i don't think that was one of the key
details
i've got a feeling
that no key details that you care about
were confirmed at all
and i got a feeling that this is just a
feeling this so
so
i can't prove what i'm gonna say now
it feels as if it's probably just summer
vacations but it feels as if the the big
name opinion pieces people couldn't do
it
they're just like
seriously
you want me to act like he corroborated
the thing he didn't mention
i feel like the ones that do the big
pieces have a little more pride it's
like i can spin this
but i'm not going to just ignore the key
detail and say that other key details
were corroborated and just lie about it
i think they had to get somebody who is
new
who would go this far
again this is pure speculation right i
can't read any minds i don't know what
cnn is really doing it could be just it
could just be that the bigger guys run
and bigger women are on vacation so they
had to find somebody to fill in but he
hilariously fills in by doing
um just the most ham-handed job of
spinning this in an illegitimate way
he'll probably get a permanent job there
it's it was so good
all right well it turns out that that
was the end of my notes because i
thought i had a third page but it turns
out that
my printer
decided all it needed was that little
line there
so it printed that little line and
that's all i needed to do
now
have i changed your minds or anything
um nope
i don't change too many mines on here
except the skittles might not be a food
group
if you think skittles is a food group i
hope i changed your mind
uh you agree on the sports good you know
part of it is because i played uh co-ed
intramural sports quite a bit
and it was just better
it was just better to have a mixed group
if i could have played at the highest
level of soccer and college for example
i
probably wouldn't want you know anybody
on my team who couldn't keep up but that
was not the case
when i played when i played soccer with
you know women on the team they were
they kept up with me
you know maybe they couldn't keep up
with the best male players of the team
but they certainly kept up with me
all right
um
oh you know about hartwick yeah
the the tiny college i went to hartwick
college
um recruited european soccer players
before that was a big thing
so so one year that i was there we had
the number one soccer team in the
country one won the country
tiny little school
that was quite exciting for us
all right um
should your theory on sports carry over
to intelligence in the classroom well it
does i mean
that's being reversed a little bit but
ideally you want people of equal
capability to be in the same class
don't you
isn't that obvious you can't always get
that there's practical reasons why you
can't do it
but you'd want it if you could get it
what if music were treated like sports
well i don't know where that's going
um
don't take criminal questions
oh how about the interview office in
town
you know what
um i had a thought this morning let me
run this by you
so i told you i was thinking of starting
like an actual podcast studio maybe
maybe something in town
where people don't have to come to my
house you know something small very
small but professional
and maybe something like i could have an
audience
so i could bring in an audience sometime
but
i realized that maybe what i have to do
is
host debates
i feel like
i feel like everything has sort of lined
up that i'm the only one who can do it
now i'm not the only one who has the
skill
that would be lots of people
but i might be the only one who has the
minimum amount of skill and the
willingness to do it
because there's nobody willing to do it
it doesn't matter how much skill they
have
so i don't think i have the highest
level skill i think i have like just
enough
but
now to do this i would have to do it on
a video though because i don't think i
could get
people to come where i live it's it's
just not it's not like in la where
people are going to go there anyway if
you had an office in new york you could
get everybody because they're in town
anyway but people are not in my town
anyway
so i think i'd have to do a video
and i might set it up so there's like
three videos
you know two of the two of the competing
people and then me
but i would be live if anybody wanted to
be there in the audience
and
my model would be heavy interruption
so
it wouldn't be a regular debate it would
be a debate in which i interrupted both
sides uh
you're ignoring the question that sort
of thing
medical software more evidence new
golden age oh
oh and interesting
julia shear says
corporism
c-o-r-p-u-s-i-m
is a thrilling useful new open source
medical software
open source medical software
hello
open source medical software
how much do i want that
that that's either the worst idea or the
best idea
imagine if you will that everybody who
wanted to i have no idea what this
product is so what i'm going to talk
about
don't assume that has anything to do
with this product but
imagine if just people could contribute
their experience of what they did
all right i had this problem
i did this for it
eventually wouldn't it turn into a giant
ai
and you wouldn't need doctors anymore
except for the physical manipulation of
things
i don't know
i think it would go in that direction
uh who would be the
first and second debaters
so who
i i don't know
i'm not sure that i would bring in
necessarily the politicians so the
trouble with politicians debating is
that they're professional liars
and we don't expect much more from them
am i right
like having a debate between two
politicians feels like a complete waste
of time
having a debate between experts
there i can imagine the model where i
could make that work
but any debate between pundits or
politicians would be just complete waste
of time
do both
i just think it's a waste of time to do
the politicians it really is
i mean the only reason to do the
politicians is that you get more
audience because they're noticeable and
you can you know embarrass somebody and
maybe there's a gaff
but it would be the least useful thing
to do you know if i did their actual
debate on policy
nobody would watch probably
is rand paul a professional liar quote
yes
yes
now i do i have a high opinion of rand
paul
and i think he he's probably one of the
most honest people but you don't think
that uh
that he's ever left anything out
do you think he provides all the context
for the other team or maybe just shows
his side
right i i don't feel like you can be in
politics and give complete
let's say complete respect to the other
team's argument before you state what
your opinion is
and without that i'm not sure that's
really honest
that's doing a good job as a politician
i love rand paul as a politician by the
way
i think he's a national asset there are
a few politicians i think have
um
let's say they've surpassed
congress in terms of who they are
like there's some people who are just
members of congress you've never even
heard their names if they're not from
your state and even them
but yeah tom cotton's one he rises above
and rand paul's one so i believe there
are some people who have risen above
their limited role that they get elected
for and he's won
in a good way
well speaker of the house is a special
case
you know
ted cruz yeah now often there's people
who have ambition to be president
yeah ted cruz i think for sure yeah and
mtg yeah some other people thomas massey
good example
thomas massey and i do not agree on
everything
but whenever we disagree his reasons are
good
which bothers me frankly
i hate to feel disagreement with people
whose reasons on the other side are
actually solid like oh that's actually a
pretty good reason
and thomas massey does that to me all
the time
i think probably
three or four times i've had an
immediate disagreement with something i
thought he said
and then you hear the larger argument
you go oh
okay
maybe i don't agree with it because i'm
not quite as you know my politics don't
line up exactly with
uh some of his stuff
but when he gives his reason
i usually say okay that's the reason
yeah he's more libertarian than i am
but he's consistent
you know
being consistent is worth a lot
and there are there are libertarian
arguments that you say to yourself well
i don't know that that would work but i
can't rule it out you know discuss them
it's got some logic behind it
you'd pay good money to hear that
now that's somebody i would debate
i would definitely debate thomas massey
because like you said he doesn't operate
like a traditional politician oh here's
here's the biggest compliment i'll ever
give a politician
you ready for this
this is literally
the biggest compliment i will ever give
a politician
i'm positive
that if i had a debate with thomas
massey on some topic which we disagreed
and i made a better argument
he would change his mind
right in front of you now i'm not saying
i have the ability to do that or that
there's any topic which is you know
stands out as the one that i would do
that
however
it is my opinion
that if i gave him a better argument in
public
that he would have the capability it's
the capability that's important right
because others would just cowardly
retreat to their their team
i believe he would actually tell you in
public they changed his mind under the
unusual condition that i made a better
argument and you know it had some weight
i don't know that anybody else could do
that
do you
would you trust anybody else to change
their mind in public
when faith i would but i'm not a
politician right
so but a politician
i don't know
name one other person you think would be
capable
forget about willing you know just
capable
i mean joe rogan would but again not not
a politician
what
co-punt
is that a word
if trump and desantis debated it would
be horror yeah
that would be a weird one wouldn't it
imagine trump and desantis debating
i can't see that ever happening
yeah i see some support for dan grenshaw
over on youtube um
conservatives have a real mixed feeling
about him don't they
i forget what the issue is
yeah
he uh crenshaw's is interesting because
he's smarter than
um
than he lets on
i don't know if you know that but
crenshaw is super smart
and i i think he's smart enough not to
let you know just how smart he is
because i'm not sure that would play
right
so he's very smart whether you disagree
with him or agree with them you know i'm
not going to have that conversation
right now oh somebody's calling him a
rhino is that what's happening
well i don't know about any of that um
he did i did an interview with him and
you know i'll tell you my first
impression was all positive so i had
only positive feelings
um
so it's mostly the anti-war versus
not anti-war enough thing that people
have a complaint about
yeah i don't know i'm not up to date so
i don't have anything to disagree with
them about but maybe i would who knows
um
but you like bill gates too well
i think bill gates the shine on bill
gates is coming off a little bit
here's what i like about bill gates
unlike you
i believe he's operating in the best
interest of humanity
i don't know that you could ever talk me
out of that because if you think he's
operating to get power
like there's no indication that he's
after power
like he could have had all the power he
wanted he just there's no indication he
wants it
and there's no indication that he's in
there for money
i don't see any indication of that
now i could be wrong right because we're
all just reading minds i can't read his
mind but i would say the indication of
anything except good intentions now does
he get everything right
no does anybody no
but if you were to bet consistently on
what he predicted
versus what other people predicted i
think you'd come out ahead
going with what he predicted
all right well we're running a little
long i see and today i think we've
nailed it
uh it's sunday
so it's the best show ever on a sunday
and
yes i am better at predicting you're
right
and uh
oh i don't think card carpool duty will
recommence so
uh when school starts i will be in a
different living situation so i won't be
carpooling
and
that's all for now ladies and gentlemen
and
uh
thank you i'm just reading your comments
and getting
transfixed by them but goodbye youtube
for tonight we'll see you tomorrow
