good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams the best
time you've ever had but if you'd like
to take this up to a level that nobody
can even believe is possible with their
tiny human brains all you need for that
is a cuper Mugger glass a tanker chal's
a Cen Jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid ey
like coffee enjoy me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the DOP mean here
the day thing makes everything better
it's called a simultaneous Sip and
happens now
go oh I just barely made
it oh man that could have been a
disaster you don't want to sneeze and
sip at the same time it's bad enough if
you sneeze and fart at the same time but
if you sneeze fart and sip at the same
time now the cleanup is just going to go
on forever anyway Nvidia has a uh new AI
agent
for $9 an hour it will be your nurse and
it performs better than
nurses do you want a $9 an hour nurse
that performs better than
nurses well I don't know about you but
how much how much do you do with a nurse
that doesn't involve touching
you every time I go to the doctor if
there's a nurse
involved they're they're getting me on
something or putting something on me
you're checking something or I don't
know how much of that can they do
remotely seems like the new the the
nurses for things that touch
you but we'll see I wouldn't mind having
a $9 nurse option oh my
goodness
sorry all right speaking of uh
microchips
Samsung is building a chip cluster in
Texas so I guess the uh Biden
Administration is going to make $6.4
billion available to help fund a
Samsung chipm thing it's going to be a
cluster in
Texas we really are not good at things
in the United States anymore are we we
we kind of have to get other people to
build our microchips does that scare you
it was only a few short years ago I
thought the United States had some kind
of
you know technical dominance on the
world but if we can't build microchips
without another company another country
helping us were we ever technologically
dominant in the first place maybe just
software I don't
know well um I got a some questions for
you about uh you know Tesla is the full
full self-driving option now now of
course it's supervised you still have to
check in with it once in a while but
your your Tesla can pretty much drive
you home on its
own and here's the
question two questions number
one what does that do about drunk
driving just imagine this scenario
you've had too many drinks you get in
your car and you have it drive you home
and you're supervising but not really
cuz you're drunk so a cop pulls you over
and says uh going to give you a ticket
they test you you're drunk going to give
you a ticket for unsafe driving and you
say but officer I was in full
self-driving
mode and the officer says but you're
still drunk and you're still in charge
of the car well that's true officer but
isn't the whole point of giving me a
ticket because you say I'm less safe
than a sober driver well yes that's true
but do you understand officer that a
drunk in a self-driving car is actually
safer than a person who's not drunk at
all who's driving their own car and the
police officer says stop trying to
lawyer me and takes him to jail
anyway but do you think there would be a
a case where the defense could say look
we I get that it's
illegal but this person was
unambiguously safer than all the other
people driving at the same time because
we can prove that the self-driving is
safer even unattended even if you're
drunk than people trying to drive home
at 12: at night and and they're all
tired I know could be interesting but
here's another one suppose Tesla offered
insurance and the amount you paid at the
end of every month was based entirely
upon how much self-driving you did or
you know how much the car drove versus
you if you could show that the car did
90% of the
driving maybe it would reduce your
insurance by
90% what about that because uh Tesla
would know how much safer it is to have
the self-driving
engaged and I think they're already
claiming that it's much safer than
humans and I believe it you know all
things considered humans are pretty
sketchy so do you think that uh a
self-driving car could reduce your
insurance costs so much that paying for
the self-driving is free in other words
could you reduce your car insurance so
much that $99 a month to pay for the
self-driving just pays for ourself
that's
possibility now we'll see all right
here's the story about backwards
science Wall Street Journal has an
article that says uh a study involving
the entire adult population of Denmark
found a clear link between cannabis
Abuse and Mental Illness there's a clear
link how many paragraphs down do you
have to read in the story before they
tell you that the clear link is not
causation and they cannot tell you if
people with mental illness are more
likely to do weed or people who do weed
are causing their own mental illness
don't you think that ought to be the
first
paragraph don't don't you think a story
like this is written to fool you into
thinking it's going to say one thing and
then it just says oh well we didn't
demonstrate any
causation and given that it's a it's a
near certainty that people with mental
illness are more likely to try to
self-medicate does anybody doubt that is
there anybody watching who doubts the
obvious statement that people have
mental illness are more likely to look
for for a solution in a drug or a drink
or a cigarette or
something I think that makes
sense fake science backward
science uh speaking of Samsung it looks
like apple is losing the the number one
position as a phone maker so Samsung not
only is going to make chips in the
United States but they're making more
phones and selling them than
iPhones what do you think of that
H I think Apple has some real challenges
because of AI so one of two things is
going to happen either either Apple will
be reborn with an AI version of whatever
they
do um or they're going to be in real
trouble and Samsung will just keep
eating their eating their Market I don't
know if you've had this experience but I
have an Apple
iPhone where I live you would be
considered a heathen if you don't have
an iPhone
is does anybody live in one of those
messed up
places where the where the iPhone is
like the that's you the one that makes
you look good but when I see people whip
out their their
Samsungs I often think to myself well
that looks better than what I have so I
do think Samsung might be out out
engineering Apple at the
moment there's a new security cam from a
Slovenian startup that can uh asso shoot
at your visitors so you can shoot
paintballs or possibly tear gas
canisters pellets I guess uh at your
visitors now how much do you want
that so you can shoot the paintball at
him to to basically mark them for the
police so so if I get a like a package
theft porch pirate I could just mark
them I want to Mark him with paint but
also tear gas and maybe sleeping
gas yeah I mean I I would put easily
stealable packages on my porch every day
if I could shoot people with a paintball
remotely but I really want AI to do it
for me I want AI to be like a
self-driving security camera where it
just looks at people and does and does
uh it does
profiling I want my AI to just look at
their face and if they have crazy eyes
you just light them up it's like crazy
eyes have been detected commencing
firing who wouldn't want that am I right
meanwhile um Steve
minuchin uh who had been treasury
secretary under Trump is trying to put
some together some deal to buy Tik Tock
but without buying the the
algorithm so I guess the problem is that
China would never sell them the
algorithm and the secret IP but he
thinks he could buy the
customers what would you buy if you're
not buying the servers you're not buying
the employees and you're not buying the
algorithm what exactly are you
buying I don't even know what he's
buying the name yeah they going to keep
the name on it but it would be a
different algorithm in a different
company how do you do that
the data I'm not even sure they would
buy the
data I'm not sure but do you think the
data would be for
sale I I feel like they wouldn't sell
you the data because then you'd know
what data they
have so I'm watching this with interest
but uh I don't know what there is to buy
exactly so we'll see maybe he's got a
plan so we hear today that uh trillions
ton of carbon were left down in the
models the climate models trillions of
tons because it turns out there's more
carbon in dirt than people thought and I
guess it can get
out I don't know how it gets out how
does the carbon get out of the dirt if
you just if you just sort of disturb the
dirt does the carbon get out how does it
get out once it's captured in dirt I
don't understand that story anyway the
point is that there may be trillions of
tons of carbon that are not in any of
the prediction models and it's like a
really big thing which means that if the
models are
wrong they're wrong and too
low or it would be proof that the models
were never
right because if they left out all that
carbon it means carbon's probably not
really what's
happening so do you notice the trend
the the climate change narrative is just
completely
dissembling you know it's just one thing
after another and just in time for the
elections now I remind you that I don't
know what's true or not true about
climate
change what I know for sure is that
scientists are full of just in
general so you can't trust them if they
say there's climate change so that
leaves the rest of us just sort of
guessing basically
all right uh the rabbit hole is talking
about a uh that's a an account on X the
rabbit
hole um people getting married later
they used to get married in the 20s now
men are getting married at about age 30
and women at about age
28 how in the world are we supposed to
reproduce if people are getting their
first marriage when they're close to
30 wouldn't that just necessarily reduce
Maybe by 2/3 than the number of kids
you're going to have maybe about half
because it's not a lot of time to have a
kid after that
anyway I just point that out that uh
everything seems to move moving toward
lower human reproduction at the same
time that robots are coming
online is it really a
coincidence that the the same time our
reproduction is going in the toilet that
robots and AI are coming online to
replace people like it it feels like
that would be the weirdest
coincidence in all of human history if
after like a million years of evolution
those two things head at the same time
that's a weird coincidence isn't
it Tim
Ferris um has a big uh podcast with a
hypnotist and I haven't listened to it
yet but here's what's interesting about
this Tim Ferris is one of those uh
influencers who if he does a big story
about something is more likely to become
a big
thing because he has a lot of reach and
influence and I wonder if this will
change what people think of
hypnosis because it's uh some Stanford
guy with a lot of credentials and he's
talking about it what it can and cannot
do I guess so I haven't listened to it
but I
will and here's what I'm curious about I
don't know if any two hypnotist would
describe hypnosis the same way
I've never heard anybody describe it the
way I describe
it um and you get you tend to get vague
words like you you're subconscious and
blah blah things that don't really mean
anything so we'll keep an eye on that it
could be that hypnosis going to become a
bigger mainstream issue well today is
Trump's hush money trial to beginning of
the trial for the stormy D Daniels
situation
now how many of you could accurately
tell the stranger what that case is
about and what was the illegal part how
many of you even understand the case and
what makes any of that
illegal I
don't I've been watching this damn thing
for how long I don't really even know
what the illegal part is what was
illegal about paying her not to
talk what what was illegal about that I
thought that was the most ordinary thing
in the whole world people pay people and
sign non disclosures and it was just a
contract
and so the was the only thing that it
came out of his
campaign and how in the world is that
not a legal campaign expense I can't
think of anything that would be be more
directly applicable to getting
elected so so I feel like they did they
have to make up a a crime just so they
could bring him in I think the public
doesn't even know what the crime is I I
think the public is thinking well was it
the sleeping with the porn star
part like what what exactly was the
crime and then you get it confused with
you know the the the other woman who
sued him Jean whatever her name is they
all run together in your head don't you
but but the reason I don't take any of
them too seriously is they don't look
real none of them look super real do
they here's my bottom
line the only thing keeping Trump out of
jail is 50 million American
men now of course there are more voters
but it's the men who keep a man in jail
because if only the women wanted Trump
not to go to jail it wouldn't make any
difference it it's only that there are
50 million
men who are getting a
little just a little bit vexed shall we
say
yeah now I see some of you in the
comments trying to Prime me to say there
are 50 million armed men but the armed
is not even the issue is 50 million
men even 50 million men without guns
could pretty much make anything happen
they
wanted but do you disagree because it
seems to me that the legal system is so
thoroughly corrupt that they would just
throw them in jail on any damn thing
that they could the only control on it
is 50 million men and it's the men it's
not the
women who are
unpredictable so 50 million men taking
the Trump theory of unpredictability
that's the only thing that's keeping if
all 50 million men said you know what um
we don't want him to go to jail but if
he did well that's the system talking
and we support the
system if they said that he'd already be
in jail and it wouldn't even matter what
they charge them they'd just throw them
in jail if they knew they could get away
with it that's the only thing stopping
them there's nothing stopping other than
can we make it look
legitimate so that the 50 million men
don't go nuts on
us well here's the good news I don't
think anything's going to change the
mind of the 50 million men so I think it
doesn't matter what the details of any
of these cases are if they find them
guilty or don't find them guilty if they
appeal or don't appeal you're not going
to put them in jail for one
day cuz I don't know what's going to
happen but I'll tell you for sure it's
going to be unpredictable and and while
I let me say as clearly as possible I
don't recommend any
violence all right I'll say that as
clearly as possible no violence but I
wouldn't Advocate against
it I mean if if the went down I'm
taking the day
off yeah CU you know I'm one of the
people who could maybe help to stop it
because I'm a public figure and I could
be saying stop it stop it nope if Trump
goes to jail for one day I'm going radio
silent and I recommend you do the the
same if Trump goes to jail for one
day the day he goes in stop using all of
your electronic
devices that's all just stop using all
of
them all right next
story
um so apparently Rick Rich noise he's a
contributing editor for um MRC
NewsBusters he did an analysis of how
often the regular news you know the ABCs
and NBCS and cbs's how often do they
tell their
viewers that uh the prosecutors against
Trump are all
Democrats don't you think that's
important yeah his name is Rich
noise that's right rich Richard
noise they could have called him dick CU
his name is
Richard but they don't want to call him
dick
noise because if you introduced yourself
as dick noise people would say what's
that sound
like are you talking about when you're
banging it on the side of the
Ural what kind of Dick noise are we
talking about that's what would happen
so he said he goes by
Rich you know a rich noise sounds like
here's what a rich noise sounds
like oh this isn't the best
caviar that's a rich
noise anyway he found out that uh the
these news entities are all gaslighting
their public because if you don't tell
them these are all Democrats going after
Trump you're you're acting like they're
actually crimes involved that people
care about there are not crimes involved
that people really care about it's
purely
political so there's
that well uh unless Israel has done
something in the last half hour that I
don't know about they're still planning
to hit back they're planning a quote
offensive and defensive action against
Iran and some say the Middle East is
going into crisis mode what do you
think's going to happen over there
what's your best
guess does it seem like they'll just do
more theater oh I'll pretend to have
some of your assets you'll give us lots
of warnings we can shoot down your slow
moving
drones like it it's all just
theater like literally just like they're
acting but what happens if it goes
beyond
that well we don't know things could get
dicey there some say that uh Iran
already used up all its good weapons on
that one night of strikes do you think
that's true do you think Iran used up
all of its good stuff on that one night
and that's basically all they have they
have other stuff but it's not positioned
where it can reach
Israel I don't know I don't believe
those stories we don't know what they
have and what they don't have but here's
my
recommendation I think Israel should uh
um make Iran take full responsibility
for Gaza
it's it's the you broke it you bought it
situation because if it was Iran and
they're sure Iran's backing is what
caused Hamas to be so aggressive then I
think um Iran should be feeding the
refugees imagine if you will we'll just
game this out um this won't happen but
we'll just game It Out imagine if
Israel's
said we care about the refugees but the
responsibility for feeding them and
we're talking about the the Gaza
refugees the responsibility for feeding
them has to be the responsibility for
the people who broke the broke it and
that's Iran so you could say hey Iran we
will open up all of the uh travel
channels and security and you can bring
in as much food and medical supplies as
you want you know we'll check it to make
sure there's no weapons but you can
bring in all you want and you can feed
these people you care about so much
we're not going to do it so if you don't
feed them they're going to
starve and we weren't feeding them
before so other people were you know
giving Aid to Gaza Etc so Iran if you
want to feed them go ahead but we're not
going to spend the penny but they'll
they'll starve no they won't because
Iran can feed them and if Iran is their
sponsor and if the sponsorship went bad
as it did that's a ran problem but I
would take another page on of uh
Governor
Abbott Abbott's
book and I would tell Iran that they're
going to have to take the Gaza
refugees now you can't quite bus them
because it's you know not exactly a
direct bus route from Israel to Iran but
you could say this is the plan you know
we might have to ship them by ship or
something but the idea is that they will
be resettled in
Iran and just say that's your policy
just say this is our policy all the
refugees will be resettled in Iran now
it's crazy talk right it's never going
to happen I
know but here's the thing here's one
thing we all agree on if you don't break
the business model of letting in another
country stir up trouble for your
neighbors if you let that happen they're
just going to keep doing it so you have
to break the business model you have to
make sure that Iran has to take care of
all the refugees because they're the
ones that broke that situation it
doesn't seem like it should be Israel's
problem because they're not the ones who
broke
it am I wrong if you broke it you bought
it and I think Iran broke it so I think
they got to pay for
it yeah and I would say this the same
thing about hezb except they're a little
better armed a different situation up
there so if were Israel I would say
we're just going to take Gaza forever
that's the the reparations and I would
call it
reparations I would say we're we' we've
spent so much money defending oursel
from
Gaza which is really defending ourselves
from
Iran that uh we're going to charge Iran
reparations and we're going to charge it
in the in the um in the form of just
keeping Gaza and just making it an
Israeli you know land so I think that's
what they they're probably going to do
something close to that but not exactly
that that's my prediction I I don't see
Gaza ever going back to a an Iranian
controlled situation and the only way to
prevent that is to not let those res
residents
back
now would that be worst problem and
cause more Wars and stuff I don't know
everything you do there doesn't work so
if you do the same things you were doing
before that would be the crazy part if
you try something as radical as you know
shipping all the refugees to Iran and
saying you broke it you bought
it I doubt they could get away with that
but what they're doing now isn't working
so you can get a lot more flexible when
everything else doesn't
work and I remind you that I'm not
speaking from a pro isra
perspective because as long as the ADL
has me as their enemy I can't support
Israel I'm just
describing just describing what the
options
are all right
um how is Speaker Mike Johnson's going
to push for Aid to Israel and
Ukraine I don't know I just can't get
past the fact that if you lump those two
things together you're not working for
the people can we all agree if if the
government was working for the people it
would be two votes instead of one
clearly they know they don't they don't
have enough support for either one so
they're going to make us eat two things
we don't want to eat because we weren't
willing to vote on them separately and
vote them down so instead of voting them
both down we'll have to eat both of them
because they'll put them together now
they're doing this right in front of
us and and that's not impeachable
I'm sure it's not impeachable but don't
you think that the speaker of the house
should lose his job if he tries to
combine those two votes to me that's a
job losing situation you you cannot be
considered credible if you're playing
that game yeah so one of the ways that
laws get made is by
tricks tricks so let me describe our uh
system of government right now
um a lot of people and by people I mean
idiots believe that our our system of
government has something to do with the
will of the
voters how many of you think the will of
the
voters is really even an important
variable in our
system you know it's not in the top 15
right it's not nothing but it's not in
the top 15
so let me tell you some things that
are well one of those is this trick I
just talked about where they use a
little uh trick to to make the public
accept two things they don't want
because they couldn't sell you them one
at a time so one of the one of the
things that makes law is when the public
doesn't want it the politicians can make
you have it Anyway by a trick by just
combining things what is that the will
of the people or is that the opposite
that is the opposite of the will of the
people and they're doing it right in
front of you so what did your vote do
what was the point of your
vote none none they can just do a trick
to remove your ability to influence the
government they just put these two
things together trick all here are the
other things that are affecting the
outcomes all of these are more important
than your
vote all of them Jerry
in the artificial way they say you know
which leader is related to which people
in the population that's totally gamed
now I'm not saying it's gamed in One
Direction both sides do it but this has
nothing to do with the will of the
people if you
gerrymander the point of it is to remove
the will of the people isn't it that's
the point of it so that the people can't
decide how about
uh the current IL ilal
migration it seems that that has a very
big in in intention anyway of changing
the outcome how much of that had to do
with the will of the
voters none none has nothing to do with
the will of the voters it's just where
whoever is in charge decides to put
these migrants or wherever they end up
how about the lobbyists of course the
lobbyists are the biggest influence they
actually write a lot of the legislation
are the lobbyist the will of the people
no they're the obv they're the opposite
the lobbyists are almost entirely to
thwart the will of the people and
they're probably the biggest effect how
about the fake fact Checkers so that the
voters don't know what's real that has a
big effect because they don't fact Jack
the obvious hoaxes how about the
brainwashing from the news entities for
example the example I gave you earlier
where the regular news the corporate
news doesn't tell you that Trump is
being chased entirely by democrats in in
the lawfare if they don't tell you that
you're being brainwashed if you don't
know the fine people hoax is a hoax Etc
you're being
brainwashed that's a much bigger effect
than voting uh social media
manipulation the jiggering of the
algorithms the Intel people and the
FBI uh putting their thumb on the scale
that's still happen happening outside of
Acts and that's a way bigger effect than
voting how about the search engine
manipulation Dr Epstein showed us that
Google can change what effects you what
outcomes you get on your search and that
can totally change your opinion in your
voting patterns way more important than
voter opinions is that they're
brainwashed how about the cancelling of
critics the intentional targeting and
cancelling of people who are unusually
persuasive well that again takes the
takes the power away from the uh voters
because voters don't get to hear two
sides if you take out one
side it's glitching now of
course how about the military-industrial
complex you don't think that we have
wars because uh that Bunch has lobbyists
and they can make money of course do you
think any of our Wars are because we
wanted them no the will of the people
has nothing to do with anything it's the
people who can profit from it how about
the uh deep State or the permanent
Washington the people who thwart
anything that the public wants they're
way more important than the voters they
have way more power how about all this
lawfare this lawfare trying to remove
the top candidate of 40% of the public
is that something that's um for the will
of the people no this is to thwart the
will of the people how about the gaming
of election
laws the uh the maras stuff where they
changed the election laws and hey it's
pandemic we better change these laws and
and what about the maale in
ballots I would say the mailin ballots
have a lot more to do with the outcome
than than your voter
preference how about uh how about
blackmail how much do you think
blackmail
by our intelligence people and anybody
else foreign foreign powers whatever how
much do you think black male influences
our laws and
policies I think a lot and probably
always has so what's that got to do with
the will of the people nothing that's
somebody getting blackmailed how about
uh when the Intel people take Mike
Johnson into the skiff and they say
we've got all kinds of Secrets you can't
tell anybody and we can't tell you how
we got this Secrets but you better do
what we say because everything will blow
up otherwise does that have anything to
do with the will of the people no that's
the Intel people completely owning the
government what about all the national
hoaxes that are run by some combination
of our Intel people colluding with the
Democrats colluding with the corporate
press we have a hoaxy if anything that
most of what we believe to be true is
literally a hoax run by one side or the
other now most of the the good hoaxes
come from the left the organized ones
the right has its own conspiracy
theories and hoaxes but they usually
Bubble Up From The Bottom so it looks
different what about the uh book deals
and board seats after office you think
somebody gets a book deal that's like
way bigger than the market usually would
pay or they get this juicy board seat
after they've been in office you don't
think that they do anything while
they're in office to guarantee they get
that big book deal or get that corporate
thing well we don't know but what I do
know is none of that would have anything
to do with the will of the
voters how about the fact that uh
schools and colleges are literally
brainwashing people to turn them into uh
citizens who don't know what's going on
or how anything works that has way more
to do with the Electoral outcome than
the will of the
people and you know I didn't even count
none of that included the possibility
unproven by any court that the elections
are rigged after all of that I wouldn't
know and you wouldn't know
either nope do you know what uh let's
see somebody in the uh DNC
said some some person in the not DNC the
Republican National
Committee uh the Republican National
committee guy Michael Watley so rasmuson
is talking about this so last week um a
Republican National Committee said quote
you've got to have observers and
attorneys in the room when the votes are
being cast and when the votes are being
counted wait why is that
important why is it important for the
Republicans that they have a republican
in the
room um when the votes and attorneys and
attorneys in the room when the votes are
being cast and when they're being
counted why would a republican need that
if the elections are
fair what why would you need Witnesses
for a fair election now what I think he
means is they they better include
Republicans or you're in trouble why
would somebody who knows so much about
the election system say that you
couldn't trust the outcome unless
Republicans were in the every
room is this not telling us that we
can't tell who voted that's how I hear
it I hear that somebody who's in a
position to know is telling me
directly that we don't have enough
Witnesses in the room to even be sure
the vote was counted and and it was a
fair
election how in the world did the public
get sold on the idea that we even know
if our elections are fair the system is
not designed so you could even
know this this problem that I'm talking
about where you have to have the
Witnesses in the room why would you need
the witnesses if you could catch it in a
recount or an
audit right wouldn't you catch it in the
recount so why does he think you
wouldn't catch
it well suppose you just threw away some
of the
boxes just throw them away Who would
know that I don't know that anybody
would know that do you think that the
Audi has a good chain of custody I think
we learned that the chain of custody
basically doesn't
exist at least in large
parts so let me let me read this fast so
these are all the things in our system
that are more important than the will of
the people Jerry mandering illegal
migration patterns lobbyists fake fact
Checkers brainwashing from the hoaxy
news social media manipulation search
engine manipulation cancelling critics
the milary industrial complex the Deep
State permanent Washington lawfare
gaming of election laws intelligence
blackmailing operations Intel
influencing using top secrets National
hoaxes run by the Intel book deals and
board seats after office school and
college
indoctrination and may be
cheating how in the world do you think
you live in some kind of voter-driven
process there's nothing like that
happening not even close
well uh I've been chasing down this
mystery of why it is that we keep seeing
stories of Voters moving toward
Trump but we don't see stories of them
moving toward
Biden and yet the election is
narrowing so how can it be that Trump
was way ahead in some polls more people
were moving toward
Trump and yet the election was
narrowing so that would mean somebody's
moving toward Biden who would that be
well according to NPR and
uh who else at least one other place um
it's college
educated uh White
voters college educated white voters and
mostly men but also women are moving
heavily in Biden's
direction do you believe that college
educated men are moving heavily in
Biden's
Direction and it says old ones
specifically
older does that sound
real has anybody notied that in the real
world has anybody noticed any older
college educated man who used to be
Trump and is now moving toward Biden has
anybody heard of even one example of
that because I've
not doesn't it feel like we're being set
up like they're telling us some
demographic is
moving but we don't know
anybody we don't know anybody in that
demographic who's moved not one person
if you said to me Scott do you know any
black voters who have moved toward
Trump I would say yeah actually I've
seen a bunch of stories about it and on
social media very
common Hispanic yes I've seen interviews
people on the street yeah
but I have not seen even one
anecdotal case of somebody moving in the
other direction not one now is that
because I'm in a
bubble because it seems like the you
know at least CNN and MSNBC they would
want to have these focus groups on every
day saying look at all these college
educated people moving toward Biden you
know what I mean oh those experienced
college educated white people that
they're they're the ones who are paying
attention and they're moving toward but
don't you think they'd tell us that
story if it were
real if it were real there would be
examples of it all over the place
because they would use it to try to
convince people to do more of
it I don't know for sure but it looks
like we're being totally gaslit here it
looks like they're pretending there's a
big demographic
change that I don't think is necessarily
happening but if it is happening it
would suggest that college educated men
are the easiest people to
fool do you think college educated men
are the easiest to
fool well college educated people are
because they believe that they learned
the
truth if you didn't go to college and
you weren't told that You' been taught
the truth you'd probably say well I
don't know I'll just look at this
myself
yeah so I think that being College educ
can give you a blind spot makes you
think you actually know what's going on
when probably it just means that you are
subject to much deeper brainwashing than
other
people but you but you walk away from
the experience thinking you're the smart
one not knowing that you're the most
brainwashed person in all of the country
and that your intelligence won't help
you at all if you're brainwashed won't
help you a bit not even a little bit
that's how brainwashing works you you
does not have anything to do with
intelligence or even
knowledge all
right so uh we're learning more about
the CEO of NPR Katherine Maher uh so
I've seen a number of her posts from the
past you her tweets and stuff and uh
she's seriously
anti-white she's really
anti-white and it's funny because
yesterday I did a comic about Dave the
engineer so Dave the engineer in the
Dilbert reborn com iic that you can only
see on the xplatform if you're a
subscriber or on Scot adams. locals.com
where you see the comic plus lots of
other things that's my commercial um but
Dave the engineer on Sunday yesterday he
was complaining about racism in the
office but when when he got down to the
details the racism that Dave the black
engineer was complaining about is that
all the white people seem to be racist
against themselves and he was finding it
creepy
it's just kind of creepy all the white
people here seem to be racists against
themselves and that's exactly what
Katherine Mar is she's literally racist
against herself and she keeps she keeps
posting super racist things about white
people of which she is one so yeah big
racist against yourself is a real thing
now so Biden's going to Gaslight us on
some kind of executive order about
Asylum laws and then you're going to
think that Biden did something about um
The
Border but apparently all he's going to
do is change the uh if he does anything
it looks like what they're talking about
is maybe changing the Asylum standards
to make it more uh difficult to get uh
to get Asylum status what do you think
that would look like in the real
world here's what I
think anybody body can still apply for
it that's what I think anybody can still
apply for it if you apply for it you
still have to have a
hearing and the hearing happens later
long after you've been released into the
into the country so suppose the only
thing he changes is the standards for
Asylum correct me if I'm wrong but that
would make no diff no difference at all
because they're all fake Asylum Seekers
but they're not going to go to court to
you know get an actual Asylum answer
they're just going to stay in the
country once they get in so it looks
like right in front of us they're going
to do some kind of play where they say
oh we did this executive order and we
changed the
standard for Asylum
seeking and it won't make any difference
to the number of people coming in
because they all just say uh well we'll
figure that out when we have the hearing
that I'll never go to sometime sometime
three years from now
that this is our actual government doing
this to us
amazing well ladies and gentlemen I
believe that
was all I want to talk about today um
until something happens with Israel and
Iran probably it's going to be a slow
news day but we'll check in on the
stormmy Daniel
stuff and I'm still Blown Away by the
fact that at one point stormmy Daniels
wrote a letter denying that she had ever
had sex with
Trump that's real right now she she must
have you know uh she must have debunked
her own letter at some point in the
process but the fact that it ever
existed that it ever existed that she
said I never had sex with
him um don't you think that should be
enough that he wasn't really paying for
uh her to stay quiet he was paying for
her to not make trouble and how is that
not a legitimate campaign
expense if the campaign is paying his
legal bills well correct me if I'm wrong
is the campaign paying his legal bills
it is
right if it's legal for the campaign to
pay the legal bills why would it not be
legal to ask somebody to be quiet about
an alleged Affair that at one point she
claimed didn't happen anyway
um she actually repeated it several
times that she that she never had sex
okay but if she ever if she ever took
that back I know but at the moment she's
saying she did right her her current
position is that she
did or is a current position that she
didn't and they're going to do the case
anyway yeah
uh she broke the contract you know it
would be an amazing
play I would like uh stormmy Daniels to
reach an agreement with Trump that she
would be the press
secretary and in uh in return for
dropping the
charges is that
legal is it legal to offer her a job
I actually don't know if it's a real job
and it's done publicly is it
legal would that be a
bribe I don't
know but um I think this is the the
weakest of all the cases wouldn't you
say do any of the cases have any real
risk to Trump at this point is there
anybody who knows what they're talking
about which would not be me is is there
anything that Trump is involved with
now that looks like a real risk I I feel
like they've slapped down enough of the
law fair that whatever's left is going
to be
trivial also Trump did not authorize
payment
well I don't know if that's going to
stand up because Cohen is going to say
that he did right
um a hush money
trial yeah I don't think any of the
cases are are going to put him in
jail uh she's ordered to pay for his so
stormy at one point was ordered to pay
for his uh lawyer costs I think that's
amazing DT says they have nothing
so ders says None of the cases are going
to amount to anything
right
um all
right offer a
bounty I just looking at your comments
here all right ladies and gentlemen I'm
going to talk to the uh locals people
privately I'm going to say goodbye to X
