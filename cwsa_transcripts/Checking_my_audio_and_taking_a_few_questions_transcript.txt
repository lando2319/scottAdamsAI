all right this is just a test of my
audio i tried to do a live stream this
morning
and it didn't go well apparently my
microphone
setup was not working as hoped
i just added a little adapter to the mix
here
and my adapter allegedly allows me to
have my power
and my microphone plugged in at the same
time
so if anybody has any questions i'll
answer them but i'm just doing a
sound check now this is what it sounds
like when i'm using the adapter
and i'm going to unplug this and then
plug in the microphone directly
does it sound like uh it's just
room audio from the ipad or does it
sound like it's actually directed from
my microphone
if i tap my microphone can you hear it
so why would this be working but it
didn't work this morning
how about the volume is the volume good
you know one of the things that i i've
been wondering and this is just
a conspiracy theory of thinking
now you can hear the tapping okay so i
guess the microphone is working
if there's anybody who uh watched my
live stream that i aborted this morning
let me know if this sounds appreciably
better because here's the problem
i i didn't change anything all i did was
restart it so that shouldn't have helped
it's not like rebooting it shouldn't
have made any difference
maybe you'll believe this next time why
would i believe you
if you're not even telling me the same
stuff because somebody says it sounds
the same
somebody says it's better sounded hollow
this morning but now it's natural
yeah so here's the question
suppose you wanted to decrease
someone's message
now i asked i asked my assistant uh
if the audio is bad and so i have i have
a confirmation that the
audio is bad apparently it is a troll
thing to tell people that their audio
is bad but i've heard it from enough
people that i know personally
who told me offline that i know it to be
true
so i i ask you this
would there ever be a let's say
let's say you were a hacker and you
worked for an
intelligence agency or you just worked
for
somebody who had an interest and you
broke into
youtube i'm not saying this happened i'm
just saying
you know could this happen in the real
world
couldn't you put a uh a little hack
into a system where you could as the
hacker
control somebody else's uh volume
and make it distorted because imagine
what that would do to somebody's
followership if every time they said
something you don't like
but not every time only if the topic is
a certain topic
you know you just get in there and go
i'll just make that audio go down and
down and down until people just turn it
off
now if you're asking me and i know
you're thinking it
am i saying that that's what happened i
doubt it
you know because anything that sounds
that that's sort of perfect
you can usually rule out just because
the world doesn't work that way
things are never that clean you know if
you were if you were going to uh
well if you could write a movie perhaps
that would be a good
script and it's totally technically
feasible right
everything i said is 100 feasible
because we know any system can be hacked
no matter how good the security is in
the system you could always bribe an
insider so there's nothing that would
stop an insider
from any system from doing something bad
if they were bribed
so there's no such thing as a secure
system
as long as there's a human being who has
access to it and that human being has
you know family members and ways they
could be blackmailed
so ultimately everything is is heckle
hackable either directly or through a
human being who's an insider
given that everything's hackable
hard would it be for a hacker to get
control over
an individual youtube account
or rumble or any other system so it
doesn't have to be about youtube
right how hard would it be once you're
in you're in right
i mean i suppose uh you'd have to be in
the right part
but once you got in the right part which
is
can't be ruled out what would be a good
way to suppress somebody's voice
i would do it exactly this way i would i
would just
ruin the sound and then people would
think that they made their own choice
not to watch
and then they would get trained not to
watch because they think ah that's the
one with the bad sound every time i
don't want to watch that one
so i'm going to do one more thing
this is just a test i'm going to pull my
microphone for a moment hold on
let's try without the microphone i think
without the microphone you should hear
a sort of a echoey barrel room
sound so that's probably what it sounds
like right now now let me
plug in the microphone directly
should be the best sound now
or at least as good as it was before
um
oh is this the best by far better even
than
when i first started i don't know you
know i i suppose i could have done a uh
a non-public uh live stream
because that's one of the options and
then just play it back myself and see
what the sound sounds like
but this seemed like more fun
okay good all right um that is all i
needed to check
and
yeah this one is not gonna be full of
content i'm just checking the sound
all right that's all i got i'll talk to
you in the morning
you
