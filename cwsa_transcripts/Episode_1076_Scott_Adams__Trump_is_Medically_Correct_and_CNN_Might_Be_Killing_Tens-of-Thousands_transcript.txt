all right this is a
special periscope on one topic
i'm going to be talking about president
trump's opinion on
hydroxychloroquine versus the mainstream
media
and i'll use cnn as my stand-in for the
mainstream
media and i want to show you the trick
that is being played on the public
so there's a persuasion trick that cnn
and the the anti-trump folks are doing
and i just want to unr unravel the trick
so you can watch it in real time and
um here's the setup
so the the idea that that uh dr
zulenko i think was the first to come up
with is that the treatment of these
with these three uh medicines in
combination
might work for um coronavirus
and covent now the first thing you need
to know
is that the whole point of it is that
the hydroxychloroquine is delivering the
zinc
and if you don't have the zinc nothing's
getting delivered
so maybe nothing happens the
azithromycin
may be you know important or not
it's not clear but let's look at what
the doctors think versus what trump
thinks and compared to what
cnn thinks i would guess
that maybe 50 000 doctors around the
world
are actually using it on themselves or
they're
prescribing it would first of all would
you agree
that that's probably somewhere in the
neighborhood
50 000 doctors if you if you look at the
entire world
now i based that on the fact that i have
personally
talked to several doctors who say that
95
of all the the other doctors they know
are using it prophylactically or
or prescribing it so would you
agree that there's some tens of
thousands i'm just going to use 50 000
just to make the case
it might be a hundred thousand might be
ten thousand but it won't change it too
much right
the point is there's a whole bunch of
doctors who say some version of this
it might work they don't say it does
work they say it might work
it's very safe and it's cheap
now who does that sound like that sounds
like trump
that's exactly what trump says trump
says might work
i don't think trump has ever said this
works
correct me on that if you can find
something that looks like he said
it does work
but i think the trump is exactly
compatible with
ten thousand fifty thousand hundred
thousand doctors
now what does cnn say about this they
say
it's dangerous it doesn't work
and the trials prove it is ineffective
and then they tell you that trump is
being
unscientific and not listening to the
experts
that's the exact opposite of what's
happening
the experts are the doctors
the experts the cnn looks to are
virologists and scientists and
researchers and people who do studies
that's a different kind of expert now it
is true
that they're much less you know
happy about hydroxychloroquine that's
true and we'll get into that in a minute
but it is completely true
that trump's opinion on
hydroxychloroquine matches
exactly most of the doctors in the
united states
let me ask you this have you ever
personally talked to a doctor
who wouldn't prescribe this
right every one of you just said um
yeah there was that time i talked to a
doctor no he said he would prescribe it
and then there was that other doctor
yeah he said he would do it too
i would be surprised if you could find
one doctor in the united states
who wouldn't give this a try if it was
available and
it was the right kind of patient so i
don't know if it's 100
and i won't make that claim but it's
probably 90 percent
how many doctors are there in the united
states a lot of doctors in the united
states
how many of them would say the same
thing
so yeah kaiser won't so you if you have
an
organization as opposed to a private
practice i could see that the
organization wouldn't do it
but i don't see that the doctor wouldn't
do it and if you can find a doctor who
would not prescribe this
i'd be interested in hearing their
argument but
the point is that whether the doctors
are right or wrong there are probably at
least 50
000 of them in the world who have
exactly the same opinion
as trump does here is the trick
or tricks the cnn uses
so when they talk about it to try to
make it sound like trump is an idiot
and uh and he's giving the wrong advice
the first thing they do is misdirection
so they'll say
there were studies but they were the
wrong kind
there were studies of people who were
already near death
and they overdosed them with a dose
that's you know way out of the normal
range
and sure enough some of them were worse
off and
none of them got any benefit that they
could measure
so this is the first trick if you say
hey i think it might work
might work don't know they'll misdirect
you
to the studies they show that it's
dangerous but they're the wrong studies
the whole point of this is to get it
early
not to get it near death because the
disease has two stages
one is the infection part which which
the hydroxyl chloroquine with the zinc
might help with and then the second part
is when your immune system goes crazy
and i don't know if anybody thinks it
would help on that
second trick they use is weasel words i
just saw this one today
there is no evidence it works
what's that mean there's no evidence it
works
what did the 50 000 doctors look at
to decide it might be worth trying did
they look at no evidence
and then they said well there's no
evidence so i think i'll give it a try
probably not because they all have
access to the internet
they probably at least googled it don't
you think
do you think there's any doctor who
didn't google this when this became a
thing
they probably googled it it probably
popped up a whole bunch of studies that
are not the gold standard kind
they indicated that there was a
mechanism that makes sense
in other words there's you know a
cellular biological
reason that this should work or could
work i'll say could not should
so that's evidence right and there are
lots of studies that seem to indicate
but they're not quite as
solid as they could be it's kind of
evidency
but they say there's no evidence but
what they're doing is the misdirection
they're saying that these these studies
that are the wrong studies
provided no evidence
the other thing they do is the missing
zinc they'll say well
here's some studies of people who got it
early
for prevention didn't help a bit and
they'll leave out the zinc
the active ingredient so
here's the the part that's blowing my
mind
if we go back to the first whiteboard
and we see that the president is making
sort of a judgment that's similar to
doctors
which is a risk management decision not
a medical decision
and when cnn tries to couch it as a
medical decision
they're just lying to you because it's
not that
it's a it's a medical realm but it's a
risk management decision
and trump being a business person sees
risk management
apparently similar to doctors who have
to manage risk
of this type all the time it's their
main job
so these guys are completely compatible
and cnn
isn't but here's the thing suppose it
works
suppose it works or let's go the other
way
let's say suppose it doesn't work if it
doesn't work
then nobody is really harmed people paid
twenty dollars for these cheap pills
it didn't work you're not you haven't
lost much
right so trump has picked a risk
management decision
similar to doctors that says worst case
scenario
you're out 20 bucks best case scenario
saves your life
it's pretty easy decision right if i
said you might die
but if you spend 20 dollars you have a
much better chance of living
so you spend your twenty dollars do you
feel bad about it no
nobody gets hurt but what about the
other way
what if it works what if the
graphs that i don't trust to be accurate
are showing that the countries using
hydroxychloroquine the most
presumably with zinc i don't know seems
to show that they're getting better
result what if they're right
now i don't trust any of that data so
i'm i'm not on the team
that says hydroxychloroquine and zinc
work
i'm on the team that says it might it
might
and if it does work
cnn would be and let's say the
mainstream media but cnn more than most
of them i think
would have directly caused the deaths of
tens of thousands of americans
tens of thousands of people will die
if cnn is wrong
if they're right it's about the same
as if trump was wrong so they've chosen
the risk management that would kill
tens of thousands of innocent americans
just to screw trump think about that
they have actually chosen consciously
a decision that they're selling as trump
being
incompatible with the science when in
fact he's
100 compatible with doctors
most of them they've sold that as the
opposite
when in fact cnn is the one who's
opposite of the doctors completely
opposite
and they have made a decision that if
they're right
nobody benefits but if they're wrong
they've killed tens of thousands of
americans
think about that and that's a choice
that they made consciously
that's not something that you know i i
made up
out of nothing that's a conscious
decision so
when trump calls cnn and the fake news
the enemy of the people the enemy of the
people may have just killed ten thousand
americans
maybe just depends if it works or not
so the point is not that they did or did
not kill
thousands of americans the point is they
made a decision
which could only have that impact or not
at all
only two choices no impact
or kills tens of thousands of people
trump and the doctors chose the opposite
either nothing happens or we save tens
of thousands of lives
to imagine that these are somehow
similar opinions
of of equal let's say credibility
and of equal philosophical
value if you will is crazy
it's just crazy so the watching
watching the fake news sell a version of
reality
that a lot of people are buying into
basically everybody i know who
watches cnn they kind of believe this
version of reality
and it's really really dangerous so i
just wanted to do a
single topic periscope on that
and that's all
