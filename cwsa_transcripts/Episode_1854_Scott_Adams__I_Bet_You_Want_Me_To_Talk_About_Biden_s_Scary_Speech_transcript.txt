good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization where everything is good
i i overslept a little bit so i haven't
checked the news today to see if
anything's happening let's see
check in the news
says biden gave some kind of a speech it
looks like
um what are they saying about it
oh
no just kidding
i got up early and listened to the whole
speech
and so what's your mood this morning
how do you feel after that biden speech
do you feel unified
we're going to get into all of that
but how would you like to take it up a
level
yeah i know you would
and all you need to do that is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker shells to stein
the canteen jugger flask vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
including unity is called the
simultaneous hip
it happens now go
well that was the first perfect moment
of my day
i feel like the rest is going to be
pretty good too
what would surprise you the most about
this
live stream
what would be the most surprising thing
i could do today
be an optimist i could be an optimist
you didn't see that coming didn't you
everything is good
everything's good
not everything but we're heading in the
right direction
and i'm going to change your mind
very soon
by the end of this live stream you're
going to say to yourself huh
i woke up all worked up and angry and
now i'm feeling kind of cool
that's what's going to happen
that's coming at you and i feel sorry
for the people who are not here
here's a question i asked on twitter i
didn't see the answer yet
which would save more lives
from this point forward right so we're
not talking about the past
so we're not talking about however many
people have already died in the pandemic
that's the past
from this point forward
which of these two actions would save
more lives
getting everybody vaccinated and boosted
or
asking everybody in the united states
to keep narcan in their cars
and in their homes too but the car would
be even more useful because the car goes
where you go
it's not even close so narcan is what
you take for an overdose now
here's can somebody clarify is narcan
only for fentanyl overdose or does it
work for
generic overdose
any opioid right
so any opioid okay
so
so narcan
is
pretty magic stuff
the only thing bad about narcan that i
understand
i mean i may not be fully informed but
the only thing bad about narcan is
whether you have it available
if somebody's got an overdose and you've
got the narcan
you don't have to be a doctor apparently
you just i don't know spray it up their
nose or whatever the hell you do with it
i don't know how you administer it but
apparently it's something an individual
can do
and we've got a hundred thousand people
dying of overdoses every year
how many of the people how many of the
hundred thousand who died of overdoses
were close to an automobile meaning one
was parked somewhere in the neighborhood
all of them probably probably every
single person was near an automobile
somewhere like parked on the street or
something
so if we just said
hey let's just put a narcan in every car
it doesn't it doesn't stop the epidemic
but are you telling me that wouldn't
save more people and by the way it
should be voluntary
so the two things our government should
be telling us to do
is where to get the narcan maybe paying
for it
maybe even paying for it like they did
with the vaccinations
but telling us to keep keep it in the
car
because china and the cartels are
attacking the united states and need to
defend yourself
you need to defend your fellow citizens
right it's not even about you
so
you may say to yourself you know damn
those addicts that's their own fault
yeah
yeah but it costs you money too
right so take care of yourself
by making sure that your citizens are
not dying for no reason that's how you
take care of yourself as well
so that's my
public service idea for the day
rasmussen says the republicans have a
five-point lead going into the
congressional ballots
um i don't know
how much to trust that five-point lead
or any of these congressional things
but
seems consistent
it seems like everybody is giving the
republicans at least a little bit of an
edge
trump
quite smartly started dangling pardons
for the january 6 protesters
now there might be some you
know some of you would have to make an
exception for because obviously some of
them did some you know dangerous stuff
violent stuff i don't think they need to
get
pardoned do you
does that anybody think that the ones
who actually committed violence should
be pardoned
yeah that's not
oh i gotta guess somebody said yes
somebody said all of them
you know i'm gonna
i think i'm gonna surprise you
yeah he he could do all of them
he could do all of them so here's the
thing is that i believe they were
they were incited
but not necessarily just by trump
um
yeah you can't keep people alive if they
want overdose that's true
so
i don't know i like i like this as a
political strategy if we just talk about
it politically and don't talk about it
in right and wrong terms because that's
a separate question it matters
the right and wrong matters but for the
moment
is it a good political move
i think yes
because i don't see anybody voting
against trump because of this do you
do you think anybody would vote against
trump solely because of the january 6th
potential pardons
you think so
i don't know i don't see many people
doing that
but i could certainly see it being a
single point of voting for some
conservatives
because when when i heard that you know
what the first thing i thought was
oh i might actually register and
vote
because then i wouldn't be voting for
trump would i
he basically you would give me a way to
vote for citizens
wouldn't it
if trump says i'll give a pardon to all
of them or or the ones who didn't do
violent stuff let's say whatever it is
that gives you a direct way to vote for
the citizens
assuming he keeps his promise and wins
so that didn't exist before did it
usually you're voting for the candidate
but he's actually giving you an
opportunity to devote to free american
citizens
i don't think i would necessarily walk
to the voting booth or even mail in a
ballot
if all i'm getting out of it is the
president that i voted for
if that's all i'm getting out of it i
don't know if i bother honestly i mean i
don't vote for other reasons i don't
like it to bias me but i wouldn't feel
like it was biasing me
if i were not voting for the candidate
i'm just voting to free the citizens and
only one of them offers that option so
i'll go okay i'll take the option of
freeing these citizens
so to me it looks like trump played it
correct
because it does activate
people who feel like me anyway i don't
know if it will activate any of you but
i could feel it i i could feel the
persuasion
like i actually
was incentivized to act to actually get
up and move and register like i felt all
that really strongly and it wasn't
because of trump
and i want to say that i want to say
that again clearly
it wasn't because of voting for trump
it's because
it was an option to free some citizens
that's all
don lemon was arguing that
when uh
when biden calls uh the mega extremist
semi-fascists that's not nearly bad as
fascist
that's not nearly as bad so stop saying
that he's calling them fascists
because he's calling them a semi-fascist
so it's not like calling somebody a nazi
it's like you're a neo-nazi
yeah i'm not you're not a full nazi
you're more neo
sort of new age you're not not fully as
bad as the other ones
and then
to don lemon
i would
i think i'd have to agree with him you
know from just in terms of how language
works semi is lesson full
so he's not wrong about that
and that's sort of a half-wit thing to
say
half-assed
semi-fascist
all right
how many of you have seen the democrats
video compilation
of republicans
calling democrats fascists
have you seen it or are you in a news
bubble
this is a test of your news bubble
how many of you seen the compilation
clip of how many times republicans
have called democrats fascists
because it turns out that they've done
it quite a bit
in public
but oh play it you say play it
it's on my twitter feed if you want to
play it but here's my point
i saw a democrat tweet that around
uh who was it
mehdi hassan
so he's a he's on twitter i don't know
what else he is
but
he tweets uh
fox and the republicans are losing their
minds over joe biden calling mega a
semi-fascist
uh but they'd never call their political
opponents fascists right
right
uh you'll be shocked shocked i tell you
roll the tape and then he shows the
compilation
but
here's where he goes slightly wrong
the compilation he's showing
shows
republicans saying
fascist policies
fascist
policies
this is acting fascist
there's it's fascist like
it's similar to fascism
and he was talking they were always
talking about politicians
politicians
politicians having policies
similar to fascism that's normal
political speech
what is not normal is saying that the
voters are fascists or semi-fascists
yeah let's say semi-fascists
that's different
so that compilation was clever because
if you were not very discerning you
think oh those look the same but they
are completely different
there's a big difference
between saying these policies are
getting a little bit too
controlling and taking too much of our
freedom
and people will call that some fascist
right
that is really different
really different than calling people and
voters fascists or even semi-fascists
so i did wake up and watch i'm glad that
i didn't watch it before i went to sleep
did any of you watch the biden speech
and then try to go to sleep
because that feels like that would have
been a bad strategy
i watched it in the morning
when i wasn't yet full of
hate you know my tank was empty so i had
lots of room for some extra hate to fill
it up
uh but i woke up this morning
and the first tweet i saw was uh a
cernovich tweet
uh talking about uh what was what do you
say a uh a hitler aesthetic
and i thought well that's perfect
the the speech did in fact have a hitler
aesthetic
now
it was sort of hitler satan aesthetic
i i saw a little bit more satan than
hitler but you could definitely see both
right it was sort of a
sort of
satan
dominant hybrid
it was definitely a hybrid of satan plus
hitler but i think it was a
sativa i'm sorry not sativa satan
dominant satan dominant
yeah
because i compare everything to weed but
that's just me
um
so
one of the things i
have you seen the hashtag pedo hitler
hashtag pedohiller
now
here again
here again we see the difference between
republicans and democrats
when democrats call
called trump hitler
don't they act like they're totally
serious
they do right i mean it comes off as
serious to me
but when you see the hashtag pedohiller
does that come off as totally serious to
you
that doesn't feel totally serious does
it even though the accusations are
serious
right they're both based on serious
accusations but when somebody says
hashtag pedo hiller
some of that's fun would you would you
give me that
there's some of that's about the spirit
of the fight right it's about just
enjoying the
the dust-up
but it was funny as hell when i laughed
at it now i have not been on i i think
you would agree
can anybody give me a fact check on this
i have not been on the
pedo thing
that's that's not my beat i'm not
covering that at all
okay can we agree that's just not my
thing
because it's you just too icky and you
never know who did really what and it's
all accusations and that
it just isn't where i want to go
but
then joe biden went all the way
all the way to uh you know labeling a
big part of the country as semi-fascist
i thought okay
it's fair now
now it's fair
i was feeling it was a little too far
but he's just brought in the i think
he's broadened the game it's fair now
in fact i don't know if i'll ever call
him anything else except beto hitler
i don't know if i'll call him anything
else he's just pedo hitler from that one
uh i'll probably get tired of that but
for now
all right
so let's talk about uh
and people were saying that trump said
bad things too
and one of the examples was he said you
know things about windmills that are not
true
i thought yeah yeah
on one hand you've got better hitler
declaring uh civil war
against citizens
and on the other hand uh trump says you
can't watch tv if the windmills stop
which of course he doesn't mean
he doesn't mean that literally
and and i think the democrats have
decided that's about equal
well one of them has declared war on
citizens of the united states and the
other one thinks that
you won't be able to watch tv if the
wind stops blowing but not really it's
obviously a joke
so yeah that's about the same
all right
so here are the some of the things that
angry joe said and i will give you again
um
a certain summary
and by the way this is one of those
situations where
the people you need
sort of rise have you noticed that
there are some people who just stay
dormant
until you need them it's like you know
break glass and emergency and sorovich
is a break glass and emergency kind of
guy
like he's always there
right he's always there
you never forget him
but sometimes you gotta break the glass
and i think the the glass just got
broken so
i'm not sure
but i think cernovich just became
unleashed
now he's not pro he's not pro-trump
remember he's not pro-trump
but cernovich unleashed is just a good
time so let's see what happens there
and don't think you can predict it
because that's what's fun about him is
you don't know where he's going to end
up on anything
so here are the things angry joe said
and
why did i bring up sort of michigan oh
because he uh
he was characterizing the speech as
basically foreshadowing
trump's indictment
do you go that far do you think that
biden's speech was
preparing the country
for the certainty of trump being
indicted
do you think that's coming
it feels like it
so you know the future is hard to
predict but i would agree with cernovich
that
it feels like it it has that vibe to it
doesn't
it doesn't mean it's true but definitely
feels like it
so from a political standpoint
this is one of the biggest mistakes i've
ever seen
but we'll see how it plays out
so here's some more of the things that
angry joe said i just wrote down
like pieces of sentences
democracy under assault
threats we face
he actually made the phrase we the
people sound evil did you notice that
have you ever heard the phrase we the
people
ever sound dangerous
he actually made it sound dangerous the
way he angry shouted it i thought whoa
how do you make those words sound evil
those are like the the most unevil words
ever written in the english language we
the people and he made this sound
dangerous
oh my god
all right you said the trump and the
magi extremists
threaten the core of the republic
huh what do you do to people who
threaten the corps of the republic
what would be the appropriate reaction
to people who threaten the core of the
republic pretty extreme
he said not every republican is mega
but he said beg is a threat to this
country
he said that the maga people do not
believe in the constitution
that is literally the opposite of their
brand
that's the most opposite gasoline you'll
ever see
even if you said the worst things about
the january sixers and mega were all
true
let's say you just accepted all the
worst accusations
none of them are about not wanting the
constitution
the constitution is all they want is
literally rule one
i mean it's just so weird that he can
say that in public
and the democrats will yeah i feel like
the democrats will be
yeah yeah
that's a good point the people whose
entire philosophy is wrapped around
strict adherence to the constitution
and they were so worried that the
constitution had not been
followed in a in a non-fraudulent way
that they actually put their lives and
livelihoods on the line to see if they
could fix it the people who cared so
much about the constitution
that they risk their lives to protect it
and and biden has painted them as not
believing in the constitution
i don't
it's just it's mind-boggling
you know there are lots of things where
you can say to yourself okay i see your
point like even if you don't if even if
you don't agree with it
sometimes you can say yeah i don't agree
with that but i see where you're coming
from i get the point there's no point
here at all
this is purely saying zero is one and
wet is dry and up is down
that's all that is and it works and it
works because the the news bubbles will
keep anybody from hearing the counter to
it all right here's some other things he
says
uh he says that the maga people don't
accept the results of elections
as if that's limited to one side uh
that uh they give power to partisan
cronies they undermine democracy itself
taking the country backwards
they might say that you have no right to
marry who you love
right biden says that the risk of these
mega extremists
is that you won't be able to marry who
you love
okay uh they're fanning the flames of
political violence
uh and more about the soul of the
country and they're mobbed this storm
the capital they're insurrectionists not
patriots
uh clear and present danger to our
democracy
there it is clear and present danger
what do you do when there's a clear and
present danger
well you don't just talk about it
do you do you just make a speech
if there's a clear and present danger
those are words of action not talk
clear and present danger says
we're putting assets in action am i
wrong
if the president who's the
you know the head of the military says
there's a clear and present danger
that means the talking is done
am i wrong
am i interpreting that wrong
to me that means the talking is done
clear and present danger you wouldn't
use that language
if you're talking about a potential
danger a future danger a thing that
might be bad a thing to be aware of a
thing to be wary of a thing to vote
against
you wouldn't say clear and present
danger
clear and present danger says fire the
missiles
right
i don't know how else to interpret that
he says you know extreme mega fear
division and darkness they thrive on
chaos angers shadows of lies
uh we're a nation that honors the rule
of law meaning that they don't uh blind
loyalty is to a single leader and
willingness to engage in violence
extremists who pursue power over already
blah blah mad republicans are destroying
american democracy violence is never
acceptable to all
so you can see the setup here right
the setup is that the government is
planning to do something to republicans
that republicans might naturally think
a violent response was appropriate
and so he's he's making sure that he's
primed you to say that violence is never
acceptable
let me be really clear violence is
totally acceptable
how do you think the country was formed
the united states was formed entirely on
violence
violence is completely acceptable that's
why we have it's one reason we have the
second amendment
violence is not only acceptable it's
required
it's required
and so don't let anybody tell you that
violence is unacceptable in a context
where some of the country might get
rounded up
it's definitely not acceptable in normal
times under normal situations and we're
definitely still under normal times
right so let me say as as clearly as i
can we're nowhere near a revolution
we're nowhere near it
that if you walk outside
and you stop looking at twitter and your
tv
everything's fine
you should try it
just walk outside
there's nothing happening out there
as soon as i walk out my door there's
just nothing happening it's like the
neighbors are walking the dogs
like hey scott how you doing how's
snickers doing oh she's great she's
slowing down a little bit
all right i like your show thanks see
you tomorrow
that's what happens when i walk outside
what happens to you
yeah no we're nowhere near this is just
political that's all it is
everything's fine
um not only that but wait till i get to
the good part there's a good part coming
so
let's see we've got uh almost 4 000
people on youtube
the locals people wanted to know how
many people show up
all right so here's what else they say
um
all
right and we can't allow uh
violence to be normalized well i agree
with that you don't want you don't want
violence to be normalized for sure
but uh
here's what charlie kirk noticed about
the speech in a tweet here are the
number of things that biden mentioned
the number of times he mentioned to
china
zero crime zero inflation zero fentanyl
zero the border zero
charlottesville
the fine people hoax once
january 6 hoax twice
is the insurrection hoax same thing so i
guess that's five times he mentioned
that trump three times um
uh extremism seven times violence 10
mega 13 and republicans 16.
now you do not have to be a political
genius to conclude the following
they are trying to distract you from
the more complicated uh things that
don't work for their side
they don't want you to think about the
economy they don't want you to think
about afghanistan they don't want you to
think about anything but this
so the reason that they're stoking your
emotions
is to get you off the trail of the other
stuff
but also as mike sonovich pointed out
quite accurately
they could be priming us for some
arrests that would include trump
so they could be priming the country and
also testing it maybe testing the the
attitude to the country
but
here's something else that joe biden
just did
i don't know if you noticed
he just gave up the high ground
he just gave up the high ground
now how do you fight trump
trump likes to fight in the gutter right
he likes to fight in the gutter what
happens if you go down into the gutter
and fight trump where he likes to fight
how does that work out for you
how did it work out for marco rubio and
you know the other republicans who tried
to do it for about a minute doesn't work
doesn't work so if you try to fight
trump in the gutter
trump wins
right
what happens if you try to take the high
road
what happens if you take the high road
well you could argue that that's what
biden did when he ran for president
and how would he do
well allegedly you won
allegedly
uh so
so biden knows how to beat trump
biden absolutely knows how to beat him
just take the high road
now do you think that trump
is not smart enough to know that the
high road has been abandoned
it's completely vacant
it's the best real
let me put it in trump terms
biden just evacuated
the best real estate in the country
the best real estate in the country is
the high ground
everybody loves the high ground
no that's why it's high ground it's a
high ground because you don't argue with
it now let me tell you a trump strategy
where he takes this boner from biden
and just walks into the white house with
practically
no no friction
here here's now everybody does this and
it's really annoying
when you pretend like you're telling the
president what he should say or do
here's why that's annoying
if anybody could tell trump what to say
or do
they would have told him to do things
differently than he did them and he
wouldn't have been president
right so every time you think you know
how to give him advice
just just take a step back
you just consider your your humility for
a moment
just just consider
that whatever he's doing seems to get a
certain effect and you don't know if you
could do that
all right so when he does things that
you wouldn't do
doesn't mean it's wrong
doesn't mean it won't work out it's just
you wouldn't have done it that way
so i'm going to do the same cringy thing
but i'm doing it in the context of
trying to
give you a lesson on persuasion right
so my context is more about
explaining why it would work
i don't have any illusion that trump
will do it
right so it's more about the the lesson
imagine if you will and again it's
purely imaginary
that trump says i'm going to give a
speech on national unity
boom
mic drop
and it's going to be in a week
boom
now what might that national unity
speech say well we would have a week to
talk about nothing else
imagine having the whole weekend
to wonder what trump will say
because it's going to be a slow news
weekend right
trump can completely kneecap everything
the biden said
by saying that he's planning to give a
unity speech
you would be so curious what that
 speech would be about
you wouldn't be able to think about
anything else
you would ask yourself is he going to go
hard at biden
or is he going to take a more clever
you know trump-like tactic that you just
didn't see coming like the trump way is
the thing you didn't see coming
basically
let me just give you some suggestions of
something trump can say
from the high ground are you ready
now watch watch to see if you get
goosebumps this will be your test
if any of this gives you a goose bump
then you know i'm on the right track
right persuasion-wise because one of the
good ways to test persuasion is if it
has a physical effect on you
like i said earlier
that you know if something has a
physical effect on you you know that's
good persuasion
all right so here's some things he could
say
imagine saying
folks let's forget about the
the 2020 election but what i would like
to bring the country together with is a
bipartisan election
reform commission
bipartisan election reform
you don't trust us we don't trust you
let's see if we can fix that
goosebumps yet yeah did you get it i'm
not done
um
number two ask for bipartisan fbi reform
bipartisan fbi reform
some people think the fbi kept clinton
out of office and maybe they did maybe
they did i'm not sure i buy that but
it's not crazy
so the fbi has moved against both
republicans and democrats am i right
they've embarrassed both democrats and
republicans the one thing we can agree
is that we need to reform them
did you know for example that
it's legal now to do domestic propaganda
so the government can do domestic
propaganda
is legal
obama signed the law
making it it was illegal and now it's
legal again
don't you think that the president could
say let's revisit that law
huh
how about that now i don't know if
that's law is good or bad because i
haven't heard the arguments on both
sides but wouldn't you love to to see
him say let's have a bipartisan
commission
decide if that law still makes sense
because nobody's going to say no to that
am i right
you might say no to changing it
but you're not going to say no to
looking into it with a bipartisan
commission
um
how about this
ask for a bipartisan commission to study
both climate risks and
the risks from cutting fossil fuels too
quickly
but if he does this he's going to have
to say in a full-throated way
there is risk of climate change
which i don't know if he's ever said
clearly
but he could
he could say scientists tell us there's
a risk i'm not going to ignore that
but what i always worry about is that
the risks of overreaction are not
included let's do a bipartisan
commission where we look at both the
risks of acting too quickly
with you know let's say cutting fossil
fuels too quickly uh compared to the
risks of not doing it and make sure we
have a complete picture
now it's got to be a bipartisan
commission not some republican you know
lead thing right
now that one you might want to leave out
because climate change is too too
provocative
um
but imagine those things so who's going
to say no to bipartisan election reform
recommendations because it would just be
recommendations
bipartisan look at the fbi
bipartisan look at climate risks and all
of the risks you know to basically save
the third world countries
and then bipartisan
look at government propaganda
am i wrong
how about he says
the border is a mess
but if you listen to elon musk we have
two problems one is you know the border
and crime and things coming across
but the other is a lack of population
our population might be growing too
slowly
so i'm going to recommend a bipartisan
commission
of economists
to give us a number of how many people
should come in under what conditions
and just say let the economics drive it
you know i won't even i'll just let the
economics drive it
now
some of my examples you know you say oh
don't do that one
but
the election the election bipartisan
commission there's no way that doesn't
work
that just works that's just the high
ground you can't take it away
how about saying i want a narcan narcan
in every car
how about how about there's one thing we
can all agree on we put narcan in
everybody's car not not required
not a mandate
not a mandate but maybe the government
can help you
know where it is and know to use it and
and get it in your car all right
so
somebody says no to that
um
now let me now let me ask you here's
here's my proposition and the only thing
i want to sell to you today
should you be in a worked up bad mood
because of biden saying all these things
or should you say to yourself
he just left the most valuable real
estate in the entire country
for the candidate that you might prefer
if you prefer trump
i don't let them talk you into doing
what they're trying to talk you into
which is acting crazy
don't let them make you act crazy
don't do it
because that's what they're trying to do
they're goading you into acting crazy
they're goading you into supporting the
people who did the violence which by the
way you did this morning
when i said should trump uh you know
pardon everybody
there were a bunch of people who
immediately backed the violent people
that's what they want you to do
now i get i get where you're coming from
by the way i understand that completely
and i'm not even disagreeing
but i wouldn't say it out loud
i wouldn't say it down loud
because that's what they want you to do
right
now
um what happens
if they indict trump
what are you gonna do
what would you do
if they indicted trump before let's say
before the presidential election but
after the midterms
what would you do
you'd vote you'd protest
um
yeah maybe you would
maybe you would
but
would you uh would you get violent
if he's indicted and they show their
evidence
not if it goes through the legal process
if it's transparent if it's transparent
it's transparent
i might not like it
but it's not like revolution time
right
now i think that in the end they're not
going to do it
in the end i don't think they're going
to indict him because i think they know
that would be too far
and not too far in terms of it would
spark a revolution because we're nowhere
near revolution but too far in terms of
it would get too many republican voters
to get off their ass and vote
what if they convict
for some bs crime well conviction is
different conviction would take what a
year or two
so you're not even gonna have to worry
about the conviction part until after
the election
and if he gets elected he probably won't
be convicted because he's in office
and if he doesn't get elected
then it doesn't change politics directly
all right
so here's my advice to you
don't get angry and violent and act
crazy
the memes that people are doing about
biden are exactly right
but make sure you people know you're
joking
right
when people talk about trump they
actually say
they think he's going to put people in
prison camps and stuff
i do think biden is dangerous to
let's say public figures who are
republican
if there was any way he could take a
player off the board i think he would
but that's that's politics in general
i feel it works both ways right
republicans would take a democrat off
the board anytime they could and the
opportunity so i don't think that's
going to change and i think that
whatever they were going to do with
trump they were going to do anyway
so
none of this changes that
so don't let them
fall for it and make sure you keep a
distinction
between the mockery
that you're giving to biden and the
actual genuine feelings that the tds
people have that he's actually hitler
that's a that's a mental illness
don't don't go down the mental illness
line
now i do know i mean
it's not lost on me that the way biden
talks does sound like angry hiller
that's what it sounds like it sounds
like he's crazy and angry and dangerous
but he's probably not
well he might be crazy but
he's probably not dangerous
just make sure that you keep it on the
mocking funny memes hitler satan stuff
because you want to mock him out of
office you don't want to give him you
know any kind of fodder because the
thing they'd like most
is for you to start blaming them for
being hitler without having the goods
and then it
you know then it looks like a tie
our leaders used to sound that masculine
on a regular basis
did they not my lifetime
uh who wrote his speech good question
all right
to me there was a disconnect between the
words in his speech and the way he
delivered it
did anybody catch that
because if you read that speech i don't
know if it would sound the way he spoke
it
because he spoke it angry crazy didn't
he he spoke it in dementia joe voice
and
and even as provocative as the words
were
it's easy to imagine
obama giving that speech isn't it
you can imagine obama giving the speech
in his calm obama voice and you would
say oh well he's just warning us of some
dangerous stuff that's okay
that's fine
he's just warning us you know there
might be some bad stuff don't be like
that you know be more american that
sounds fine
if you just read the words
in normal voice even though the words
are plenty provocative
but if you read them in a normal voice
they would sound different
now
a lot of people are giving me credit
this morning for
accurately predicting that republicans
would be hunted
which the
democrats say
hahaha that's your worst prediction
you've ever made and republicans say
well you nailed it you're right on there
being haunted like crazy
but i don't think i can convince anybody
that i'm right or wrong on that
everybody's just to see the wrong movie
now
whoever wrote that speech and whoever
staged it
they
i don't think that they knew it was
going to look like a satanic
um setting
but the the reds and the lights actually
did it was impossible not to think of
satan
is there anybody who didn't think of
satan when they watched that
is there even one person
who watched that and didn't immediately
think of satan
am i right
i think everybody thought satan as soon
as they saw it didn't they it wasn't
just me
somebody says cnn changed the the color
saturation and made it pink
but i saw a video that claims they were
doing it on that video and it didn't
look different to me
so you think that it was orchestrated to
look like
satan
no it wasn't
i i'm going to say with
complete confidence
it was not intentionally made to look
like a satanic set
not intentionally
i think they just didn't know how it
would look on camera until it was too
late too late to change it probably
all right to get his base terrified oh
you think you think it was to scare his
base
maybe
i think he was supposed to look
here's what i think
let me let me modify my answer a little
bit so i said it was totally not
intentional i think the intentional part
was they're trying to make it dangerous
looking
i think they intentionally
made it dangerous looking would you
agree
i think they didn't know
that it would look actually satanic
i think that was just a
mistake
to scare the poor in the ignorant yeah
maybe
so
um
what do you think of my general thesis
that he's made it
easy for trump to win the presidency
all trump would have to do is
um
act more mainstream
and that's it
that's it just just talk about
bipartisan stuff and
just walk right into the oval office i
don't even think he has to fight at this
point
all right
pardon the non-violent ones yeah i think
that part's simple
it's a blind spot because they're used
to attending satanic sacrifices somebody
says
maybe i don't think so
yeah i think they're they're gonna
regret
embracing dark brandon
because remember i taught you that when
hillary clinton started saying that
trump's speech was dark and i called
that out as a professional word which i
think it turned out it was
that
the reason the reason you don't name
your own candidate dark is that has too
many negative connotations
even if you think it's like cool and
hip there's just the word itself carries
a little program with it that you can't
you can't strip out of the word
they think the strategy is going to work
um
i would love to see cnn's coverage today
i'm going to make you a prediction
here's my prediction
that at least some of the cnn opinion
people will say that he blew it anybody
want to take the bet
no msnbc will say he nailed it but i'm
going to bet that at least one
at least one
opinion person who's not a republican
but a democrat will say he went too far
oh msnbc already says he blew it
who said it though
has it already happened
yeah only the guests
well that's what i'm talking about you
know the pundits
now that's a good question what what
will van jones say
have i told you recently how much i like
van jones
he does seem to be able to tell the
truth in an environment where other
people can't figure out how to do it
smoke onish is is
top shelf as well
yeah smart garnishes is solid
all right
um
what truth
well you know van johnson called the
um what do you call the uh rush
inclusion and nothing burger was that
the one he called a nothing burger
all right
um so there's not much else to say
um so that's my advice to you
don't allow yourself to get too worked
up because that's the plan
make sure that you mock dark brandon and
his hitlerian
stuff but make sure that you're having
fun with it
because
we don't think he's necessarily in
control do we
and to me it looks like he blew the plan
whatever the communication plan was i
think he blew it
and so i think you're better off than
before
so if if what you wanted was a
republican to win the presidency
i think you got closer to it i don't
think he got further away from it so you
should say today was probably a good day
for you if you're republican
it just doesn't look that way right away
all right
ridicule is your favorite weapon it
should be is there any topic i left out
today
anything else that you wanted me to talk
about
now that artificial intelligence is
sentient it doesn't matter any of this
stuff i don't think
all right
best episode ever i'm sure that's true
and i think that's all we need to talk
about today
oh the electricity in california let's
talk about that so we're in a little uh
heat
heat bomb at the moment
um
i believe there was some power company
in another state where the power company
actually took over the thermostats of
their customers for a while
and that's some scary stuff
was it denver yeah it was colorado
and
is the baby yours no
nope
as far as i know
i mean
as far as i know it's not mine
uh president had an outage by a crow
i don't know about that
you know what you know what else uh
trump could do that would
be a great unity speech
do a unity speech and describe all 15
hoaxes that the democrats have played
just read them off he doesn't have to
spend much time with them just read that
there's 15 hoaxes
because the
the news would have to cover them
and then they'd have to write you know
these tortured
articles where they say no no he he
really meant the nazis were good people
in charlottesville which
is ridiculous
yeah the top 15 hoaxes you should just
put him out there and let the other team
know that they're there
oh there's a trump rally tomorrow
most democrats believe all of them
they do but it would require the news to
deal with them and publish them
so that's where you get the win
can you reframe going through a
bankruptcy well a bankruptcy is
not not paying your bills
it's just giving you time to reorganize
and
given that we came off a pandemic
bankruptcy isn't what it used to be
so bankruptcy doesn't mean you failed it
just means it was a pandemic
and even if the reason you're bankrupt
is because of something you did not the
pandemic
or something you didn't do
um it's still going to look to other
people like it was the pandemic because
of the timing
so i don't think you have to worry about
the
the reputation
you don't have to worry about whether
you failed because there are just too
many external variables going on right
now
and it's just something you have to work
through there are plenty of bankrupt
people who did fine
there are plenty of them
you know
bankruptcy exists for your benefit
it's not your penalty it's for your
benefit so that you you don't go
completely broke immediately paying off
creditors so bankruptcy is the thing
that's saving you not the thing that's
ending you
at least that's how it's on paper
it should work
all right
uh they would just say trump lied about
a list of fake hoaxes they would say
that but would still make him look at
them all
um how do you reframe a crazy wife
well
no comment
all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you
yeah
divorce all right i'll talk to you
tomorrow
maybe later today
see you later
