good morning everybody
and welcome to the best damn thing that
ever happened to you
at least today so far
and i think
that for some of you you probably came
in here with low expectations
oh i think i'll check out this live
stream
something about was sipping and then
and then
you find out it's the best thing that
ever happened in the world
and then you've got to tell your friends
but it's probably after you hit the
subscribe button
however if you'd like to take it up a
level
i have a way
it's a system all you need is a couple
of my girl glasses attacker chelsea
stein a canteen drug or flask a vessel
what kind any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
it's the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day it's the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and aren't you lucky to be here for it
oh yes you are
go
i hope you didn't go over a 10 slip to
serp ratio it's very important
if you if your slurp is under 10 of the
total sip
you're in just the right range
don't overdo it don't under do it
you ever have like a weird hair that's
just like in your eye for no reason
what the hell's going on here
all right uh well
um in an uncharacteristic morning
cnn has a lot of fascinating news today
i don't know if it's because most of it
isn't about trump
but they actually have some pretty
interesting stories
here's my favorite
um in the context of climate change
uh we're having our record snowfalls and
and
low temperatures
and of course the northeast is blanketed
by snow
you know they're getting one or two feet
of snow up in the northeast
uh electricity is impacted
but um
nor northeastern people are what's the
word
what's the word for the people who live
in the snow country all the time
hardy
oh you got it yeah so somebody got it
before i even said it they're hardy yeah
it's funny
you can imagine a lot of people who
would be in real trouble if they lost
electricity
in sub-zero temperatures
but the people in the northeast are like
that's why i have a fireplace
that's why we got a fireplace of course
and
that's why we have a neighbor you know
that
so so somehow they'll figure it out
somehow they'll figure it out
um it is dangerous i don't want to
minimize it and then
it is very likely in the summer some
people will freeze to death
but it's sort of like a
endemic
you know cold weather isn't a pandemic
in the northeast it's endemic
you're used to it
so it's funny what kind of risks you can
get used to when i lived in the
northeast
yeah we had power outages in the winter
if that happened
and
i don't remember ever being super
panicked about it
it was just a pain in the ass
i mean that's about it
all right um but the best part of it is
that there's going to be a thing
happening in florida in all likelihood
because the temperatures are approaching
freezing even in florida
and they're going to have a phenomena
that cnn reports is called
a chance of falling iguanas
apparently iguanas can't take the cold
and they live in trees or or they're
often in trees i don't know where they
live but they're often in trees
and when it reaches a certain
temperature the
iguana will freeze
and fall out of the tree
so if you're in florida at a certain
temperature
you don't want to walk under a tree
because an iguana might fall on you
now that's what i call news
this is news you can use
a lot of the news is just pure fake news
it doesn't help you at all but this
would help you avoid
being hit in the face with an iguana
and i know you'd like to avoid that
wouldn't you
all right um but apparently this is a
temporary effect in that even the
falling iguanas
rejuvenate themselves when when it turns
warm
that's much the same way i am
when the temperature reaches a certain
amount i just go stiff and i i fall on
the ground
and i just stay there until it warms up
and then i'm revived
very much iguanalike
well
uh as i tweeted this morning i i
punished myself last night
by forcing myself to watch msnbc for
nearly i don't know i think i hung it
out i probably lasted 15 or 20 minutes
i don't like to use the word heroic
but i think it applies in this case
it was heroic
now i am completely aware
that if you're if you spend your time in
one bubble it doesn't matter which one
you're in
if you if you move to another bubble and
spend some time there
you will be horrified
and i'm sure it works both ways
i watch mostly fox news
now the reason i watch it
has a lot to do with the fact that
they just have better producers
it's just a really well produced
show so i just i don't know i just enjoy
the
the texture of it more than than other
places but i try to get my news from as
many sources as possible so i don't get
lost in a bubble but man it is
horrifying when you go into a bubble
you're not familiar with now let me tell
you what they were doing in the msnbc
fake news bubble
so they were doing a lot of uh horrified
uh reporting on january 6
because the ghost of trump is the ghost
of trump past but also the ghost of
trump future maybe
so they're worried about him in the past
they're worried about him in the future
and they have a full tds that has not
subsided
and here's the thing that they leave out
from their coverage of january 6th
they leave out
that the protesters thought they were
stopping
a coup
they didn't think they were causing a
coup
they thought they were stopping one
now
is that true
yeah was there a coup
and did they try to stop it does it
matter
it kind of doesn't matter because you
were talking about the intentions
the intention
was that they believed the election had
been overthrown
or fraudulent and they needed a delay
to get the enough of an audit going they
thought that maybe they could discover
it because remember the thinking was
that the fraud was really obvious
right
it's hard to put yourself in the mind of
the time because you've learned a lot
since then
but in the thoughts of the time they
thought they saw it in real time the
fraud
they they thought they saw on television
the vote count go from a high number to
a low number like right in front of them
now it turns out that there was a
legitimate sounding explanation for why
that happened
but remember we didn't know that yet
or at least the crowd didn't know it i
don't i don't know when it was first
reported or debunked
but
but people thought they saw with their
own eyes the country being stolen
and so they thought they were fixing it
now i get that they might have been
wrong
don't know for sure because the election
was never audited in any deep way
we only know that the courts never saw
some evidence
so there's no evidence that the courts
ever saw of any fraud and i'm personally
not aware of any
so if i can
you know maybe not get demonetized on
youtube let me say i'm not personally
aware of any
credible evidence
that anybody is brought up to my
attention
that would suggest the
election was fraudulent
i am very aware
that there are a lot of suspicions and
things that haven't been fully
researched
that's true
and i'm also my
to remind you my global opinion
is that anything that can be rigged
will be rigged
you just don't know when it happens
so i have no reason to believe it's
happened already
but i have 100 certainly it will happen
if we don't plug the holes because it
always does it's just it's the most
predictable thing
in human events is that somebody will
use a fraud
if it's available
if it's not available they won't use it
it's pretty predictable
so
when i watch msnbc and i see them
abusing their viewers and i do think
it's abuse
i i don't even mean that as hyperbole or
spin
this actually looks like abuse
because if you leave out the most
important part of the story
and report it without that most
important part it reverses its meaning
and actually reverses it to the point of
pushing people to
potential violence
or even wanting to lock up trump
supporters which you see a lot of talk
about that right
so
this is actually abuse and i don't think
we should call it fake news
because fake news would suggest some
other intention or i don't know maybe
they got it wrong maybe it's an accident
you know maybe it's just political spin
but this feels exactly like abuse
and i thought you know everybody always
talks about
you know why don't we have a news entity
that simply reports the real news or
uh
uh the press cannot commit fraud if you
also have a recording device somebody
said
well
that's not true because you can record
some of these quotes and then leave out
some context on the story and it's still
fake news
so
um so you've got an embassy msnbc
abusing his people and you wonder why
can't you have like a uh why isn't there
space in the market
for a legitimate
reporting organization
like why doesn't anybody
walk into this gigantic space
of just being objective and tell the
whole context
do you know why
well it doesn't pay there's no business
model that would support it
the day that that started
on day one everybody who watched fox
news would look at it and say well
that's not what fox news says
so
looks like it's just another fake news
site and all the people who watch cnn
and msnbc
they would come and they would see this
hypothetically fair reporting and they
would say well that's not what we heard
so it looks like another fake site
you could you could never make money by
reporting things honestly
we unfortunately humanity is not
designed
to accept that business model compared
to
the business model that just gets you
all excited and you know makes your
brain on fire
they're not really competitive
but i came up with an idea
that would be really low cost
and would sort of get to the problem and
it goes like this
create a website that is nothing but the
part left out
just the context they left out don't
even report the story
so just just have a website says january
6
msnbc
the part they left out
the protesters thought they were saving
the republic
not overthrowing it
and that's it don't even tell the story
it's because if somebody doesn't know
the the story
they're not going to go to this website
because it's not an original website
where you learn the story
it's only where you go to find the part
they left out
now you'd have to be fairly confident
that it was true
but you could also report it as
here's the part you know fox news says
they left out
which then allows you to report it
without saying it's true or false
um
tim poole so he said tim paul i assume
you mean
that that he's one of the people who
fills in context i think that's true
uh paul harvey yeah in the old days i
suppose
but don't you think that would be an
easy website to spin up
because it wouldn't be hard to know what
people are leaving out
you know maybe it's
you know user managed maybe it's open
access or something
but that's the part you don't you don't
need an entire news organization you
just need a context missing here it is
here's the part they left out boom
and it works both ways by the way don't
think that this wouldn't work
in a in a on against fox news
because don't you think that fox news is
a little pro ivormectin
right at least the opinion people not
the news people but the opinion people
are sort of pro-ivermectin
and wouldn't you like to see on this
context
the any studies that
say the opposite
i'm not saying which one's true for this
conversation
i'm saying wouldn't you like to know
if the opinion hosts on fox left
anything out
i'm not saying it changes the
the result i'm just saying wouldn't you
like to know if they left anything out
because i would i would imagine it's
just universally true
that at least the opinion people
are
are giving you their opinion which would
minimize some things that maybe maybe
you missed entirely
i don't know i think it helped
um
all right let's talk about
um oh and i guess here's the question
for me
for you
so so i've given you this clean example
of msnbc leaving out contacts cnn does
the same
the context being that the protesters
thought they were saving the republic
not overthrowing it
is there any example where fox news has
done anything that bad
because i feel like i have a cognitive
blind spot there
what would be an example
they reported arizona too early
yeah i mean
that's not the same kind of stuff we're
talking about
uh
i'm supposed to be filling that role for
you well i'll try
birth certificate
what'd they leave out
w and d is in iraq i think everybody got
that wrong
so you know the wmds in iraq would be an
example of
of just a mistake i would think
it doesn't sound to me like anybody left
anything out
yeah the arizona reporting was too soon
i know what you're saying
but doesn't that sound like just a
mistake that's not that's not leaving
out a narrative
right i'm talking about a narrative that
just leaves out
an entire like important part
you know
the arizona reporting was just maybe a
mistake or a judgment call or something
um
all right you real i didn't realize how
obsessed you are about
how many of you really cared about
election night
boy that really made a difference didn't
it
i did see the numbers a lot of people
abandoned fox news and went to the
competitors there for a while
um
no one reporting on the poll workers
getting kicked out of counting
i i saw that reported
all right well
um
so i'll uh accept that they got it wrong
but i don't know if there's an
equivalent example of a narrative that
was just left something out
but if you think of one send it to me
i do think there's a difference i
here's the difference that i think i
detect now this is purely subjective
right
when fox news seems to leave let's say
the opinion people sort of leave what i
think is established fact
it's usually obviously hyperbole
in other words as a as a viewer you can
identify
the hyperbole um let me give you some
examples
let's see
let's say immigration
yeah right if a fox opinion person
talks about lots of criminals coming
across the border for immigration
do you say to yourself oh
that literally means it's crowds of
criminals or do you say to yourself
reasonably oh they're saying
they're not saying they're all criminals
they're saying that there are too many
criminals
right i mean doesn't your brain just
automatically
adjust the hyperbole because you
understand the source
mine does
so to me it doesn't seem like they're
leaving anything out it seems like they
just ramped up their point a little bit
that's what the opinion people do
then there's stuff like the war on
christmas
right there's nothing left out
is there
that the story is complete it's just
they have a strong opinion on it
how about
a critical race theory
do you think that fox news leaves out an
important part of the narrative
or do they maybe exaggerate
wanda i don't even know if it's an
exaggeration actually but they certainly
make their point
it seems to me that there's this
difference where msn msnbc is literally
intentionally creating fake news
whereas fox looks to be literally
intentionally exaggerating their point
and those don't look the same to me
because you can pick up an exaggeration
easily i mean it doesn't take too much
discernment
to know when an opinion person is
exaggerating
but it's hard to know something's left
out of a news story
if you don't know if it's just left out
you wouldn't know it's left out that
seems really different to me
all right
uh trump had his uh
he had a rally and of course he always
makes news and here's something he said
he said if i run and if i win
we will treat those people from january
6 fairly
we will treat them fairly trump said
and if it requires pardons we will give
them pardons because they are being
treated so unfairly
i have to admit
that hearing that and that alone
almost made me throw down for him again
because you know i don't want to be a
one-issue voter
but if you had to be a one-issue voter
on this issue
that's sort of defensible
isn't it
you know putting political prisoners and
political prisoners
if that's what's happening and it looks
like it to me
i mean i i don't know if i have all the
context now i'm not saying that they
didn't break laws
that's not what i'm saying
people who broke laws have to have to
answer for that
no there's no exception there
but
i'm not sure that the way they're being
treated
is exactly
non-political it looks political to me
and most of you i think would agree
so when you see a president make a
promise like that
i almost say to myself i almost don't
care about the other issues
because if you don't if you don't fix
this
what else matters
nothing
if you don't fix this nothing else
matters
if they can put people in jail just for
essentially for political wrong speak
you know in the context of you're seeing
um
you know you're seeing uh freedom of
speech being curtailed etc
this is almost good enough for one issue
but i'm going to tell you something and
you're not going to like it
if trump
messages the same about immigration
and he runs again i can't support him
i can't support him
and here's my thinking
the first time he came out it was
actually politically
kind of genius
to
exaggerate the
let's say the danger from immigration
it probably made sense for him to go to
go to the top of the conversation
by saying something that his base wanted
to hear
and that
was provocative the news couldn't stay
away from it
and it sounded vaguely racist but you
could also understand it as hyperbole in
which case it wasn't
given that everything he says is
hyperbole
why would this be different
literally everything he says is
hyperbole
so you know a a discerning viewer would
say oh that's hyperbole he doesn't mean
everybody coming across the border is a
racist
or a criminal he doesn't mean that
there's even more criminals among this
class of people except people who go
across the border illegally yeah maybe
maybe have a little more criminals in
that mix
but
but here's my thing
after seeing how that worked out for him
meaning it didn't work out
and it also
painted his supporters as racists
didn't it
it made you a racist even if you're not
because you said well i like you know
trump on taxes and supreme court
nominations
so i'm going to overlook his hyperbole
about the
people coming across the border not the
issue
the issue still matters to you but about
the individuals the characterization of
them maybe you'd overlook that even if
you're uncomfortable with it because
it's hyperbole
but if he runs again and he does the
same message
i can't i can't support that because at
this point we know how it's received
right we don't have any mystery about it
we know how it's received and if again
he emphasizes
the criminals coming across the border
i don't think that matches fact
because my observation and i'd be
willing to change my mind on this if
there were data but my observation is
that the people coming across the border
are more law-abiding
more
law-abiding now that's just subjective
and this is based on living in northern
california not southern because the
southerner is closer to the you know the
trouble but in northern california by
the time people are filtered
up to where i live
you get the people who just really want
work
and they do not want trouble they do not
they're not going to steal a knick-knack
from your dresser
while they're cleaning your house if
that's what they're doing right
it's they're unusually law-abiding and i
can tell you that from my experience as
a restaurant owner
they're unusually law-abiding the ones
who really came here to stay and you
know want to make it
work now
um total lies now remember you can't
call me a liar
because i just told you this was a
subjective impression
you could say i'm wrong and i won't even
debate you
you could say that it might have to do
with my little bubble i wouldn't debate
that
because i'm speaking from my bubble
i'm telling you that
if he makes this messaging again
i don't want to paint myself as a racist
and i couldn't support it
i couldn't support him as president
if he said this however i could support
it totally
here's what i would totally support
let's stop talking about the nature of
the people coming across
because that's just making everybody
unhappy
let's talk about the fact that you can't
have a country unless you can control
the border oh i'm in on that
i'm all in on that you have to have a
you have to have border control or
you're not a country
who gets to decide
the economics of your country the people
who decide to come in or the country
well the country
so there's there's an argument
for border control
that is yeah he did say all that but he
also said the other stuff right he
doesn't need to also say the other stuff
if he runs again
because we already heard it
it's sort of baked in
so if he could change his messaging on
that now the fentanyl problem is more of
a china problem and he was also soft on
china on fentanyl which i have a big
problem with by the way if somebody ran
against trump and said they would be
tougher on fentanyl
i hate to say it but that's another
one-issue kind of situation with me
so i don't i don't think anybody's going
to run on that basis so i don't think
it's a risk so let me say that i do not
automatically think that i'm going to
support trump if he were to run i'm not
sure he will
but if he does
i can't say i would support him if he
did the same messaging
i just don't think i would
all right
because and and remember the point is
how it affects me
right
i'm saying that if he says that
messaging again after seeing it totally
doesn't work
just makes it look you know just
invites charges of racism
i just don't want to be on that train
again
now of course it's always going to
matter who he's running against right if
he's running against the worst candidate
in the world then yeah i guess you have
to go with what works
but uh i could not be comfortable
with his immigration communication if
it's the same
all right and i realize a lot of you
disagree with me and that's fine
do you know what i like best about this
audience
i'll bet i'm the only live streamer
who disagrees with his audience a lot
which says a lot about you in a good way
it's actually probably the best
compliment you could ever have
that you're willing to absorb content
that you know is going to be
a little
a little bit uncomfortable sometimes
i have to admit i have a tremendous
respect
for the live stream audience because i
do thank you that you have self-selected
as being
more i'd say more intellectually
flexible
than almost any other group in the
country i'll bet you know and a lot of
it is no a lot of it is self-selection
so it's not because i've changed you in
that way i think it's self-selection
people can handle it
all right um let's talk about putin
everything i thought i knew about the
russia ukraine situation is wrong
or was wrong
and maybe it's still wrong but here's
what i thought
i believed based on reporting
that we could cause so much financial
impact on russia
that they wouldn't make a military move
because they would be crushed
financially
it turns out based on cnn's reporting as
of today and it looks it looks like
pretty good reporting
i think fox might have said something
about this too but uh cnn reports this
that russia provides around 30 of the
european union's national natural gas
which was good i i feel like you can't
understand the situation
unless you know that situation the 30 of
the natural gas for europe
is coming from russia
and it's a vital role in power
generation home heating and it's the
winter so it's pretty important
and but here's the deal and then there's
the nord stream you two of course is
part of the part of the story
did you know that if europe stopped
allowing russia to participate in the
financial
let's say credit uh market
that all they have to do is sell their
energy to china
how many of you knew that
that if russia just got closed down by
europe through some financial mechanisms
all they have to do is is turn the valve
and send more of it to china and less of
it to europe and that china wants to buy
as much as they can produce because they
need energy
all right some of you knew that and by
the way congratulations if you did
because you would be well more
now i didn't i didn't know
i didn't know it generally
like
in a conceptual way obviously i did know
that they could go to other markets and
china would be the obvious one i didn't
know how easy it would be
did anybody know how easy it would be
because i didn't realize
that they could bypass the entire you
know traditional global financial market
and just sell stuff to china and take
money for it that's all they need to do
so um somebody says russia hates china
well the other thing i'm learning today
is that china and russia have forged
ties that are stronger maybe than i had
realized
and they do seem to be working as a team
which is really scary
now when i say team
i feel as though maybe
russia is a chinese puppet already
maybe in some ways anyway
because
uh if china were not giving russia this
support
then russia couldn't do what it wants to
do you know threatening ukraine
and something tells me
that china would benefit so much
by russia going into ukraine
that they're going to make it happen
because if russia goes into ukraine
what's going to happen
it will make nato look like a paper
tiger
it will look like america can't protect
you
and they will
have made a gigantic step
toward dismantling economic power
by showing that it didn't work
and by simply making themselves
wealthier by having more energy
and making russia even better off
perhaps
having a stronger partner that won't
threaten them and they'll just buy their
energy
so
uh the russia
and
china
connection which does look like
russia will be the dominant partner and
already is
it can't be underestimated because you
have to say to yourself not just what
does putin want to do
haven't we all been fooled by the
question of
putin makes all the decisions up to
putin whatever putin does putin hasn't
decided putin putin
i've got a feeling that that's all wrong
i've got a feeling that president xi
gets to decide if putin attacks ukraine
and here's the bad news
it's in she's best interest i think
to attack
so my uh previous
prediction
was that there would be no major
military conflict i did allow that there
might be a minor incursion
but i didn't think there would be a
major like you know
overthrow of ukraine
because i thought there would be too
much risk
of closing down uh russia's economy
turns out that's not much of a risk
or at least it's not a big enough risk
that would stop them from doing what
they want to do
so here's the most dangerous situation
in the world countries that want
different things and cannot judge
the military strength of the other
in this context i'm calling the
financial
financial sanctions military power
i'm calling hacking military power
and i'm calling actual
you know bullets and kinetic stuff
military power
can you tell me who would win
if russia attacked ukraine
now by when i think we all accept that
russia's forces could control the
ukraine if they put it all out there
so that's not the question the question
is would russia be better off or worse
off if they do it
you don't know
you really don't know
do you know what happens when you don't
know who would win a war
you have a war
yeah if you don't know
that's a dangerous situation what is not
dangerous is knowing who's going to win
if you know who's going to win or
equally good
equally good if you know both will lose
so one of the reasons we haven't had a
nuclear confrontation between nuclear
countries
is because both know with certainty
it's a lose-lose situation right
nuclear war is pretty much a certainty
nobody wins
that's why it doesn't happen
and traditional war doesn't happen
also
if you if you don't know you have a good
chance of winning
but this russian situation when you
throw the
economic uncertainties you know would
these sanctions make that much
difference you throw in the cyber
uncertainties exactly how much power
does russia have cyber wise what could
they destroy in the united states if
they wanted to i don't know
what could we do to them i don't know
what would the economics be i don't know
would it be good for america or bad for
america i don't know
good for europe or bad for europe
probably bad
but if it's good for china
might still happen
so if so here's my adjustment to my well
really a complete reversal
of my opinion
as long as the variables stay what they
are
then of course the variables always
change right but if they stayed where
they are i would say a major invasion of
ukraine would be almost guaranteed
because russia too has to figure out the
limit of their own power
that's one way to find out
it's one way to find out
so at this point russia's advantage i
think is to invade ukraine
because here's what's going to happen
nato won't respond directly
they will take losses but they would
they would show that they had the power
to do it and then they would do it
then the entire world financial system
would start moving toward china which is
what china wants
the china-russia connection will get
stronger
which maybe russia and china both want i
don't know
so
i've got a feeling
and yeah don't
don't forget that there may be a
a deal
where russia gets support for their
thing and then china gets support for
their thing
meaning taiwan
so
i don't know about taiwan but i would
say the odds of
ukraine being invaded unless you know i
suppose if russia got some
major concessions
they would pause but it looks like we're
not going to give them any
do you think we're going to give russia
any concessions
i don't think so
because we can't if we give them
concessions it's the same as losing it
just means they'll take something else
and they'll just keep pushing
until they can't push anymore
so why would he stop pushing if we let
him push
so
i would say the current set of variables
largely guarantees
russia will
conquer ukraine
i don't know if they can hold it
because the locals will have lots of
weapons
but i think they'll conquer it at this
point now like i said this is a
conditional prediction just like my what
i now consider my incorrect prediction
from yesterday because i learned
something
fundamental
that was new to me new to me
if i learned something else tomorrow
that's new i'll change it again so it's
it's not like a prediction prediction
it's more like a conditional one
if if the variables stay the same
yeah the ukrainians will
well actually
i did see an interview from a ukrainian
guy who said we're not going to fight
against our brothers in russia
did anybody see that interview
there's a ukrainian citizen it was an
older guy so it wasn't like a
young guy saying harsh things it was an
older guy who said if russia comes in
militarily we're not going to fight
russians
like russians or our brothers we're not
going to fight them
so you might you might have a situation
where some
or a lot of
the ukrainians think it's a war between
governments you know what i mean
if it looks like a war between
governments this
i don't even know
it's not like ukraine's government is so
honest that they want to keep it right
isn't the reason ukraine is not nato one
of the reasons is because they're so
corrupt
their own government ukraine is so
corrupt
that they can't even join nato
if you live in ukraine and you know your
own government is so corrupt you can't
even participate in normal world
alliances
how much do you care if putin's in
charge
probably not that much
right the the odds that would affect you
personally might be actually low
scott why did you say a war would move
work to china
did i ever say anything like that
that doesn't sound familiar
yeah that doesn't sound like something
i've said i don't even know the context
of that
um
let's see what um did you do this to
teach us how to be open to new
information no no
no i'm not that clever uh
sometimes you see me in the context of
the live stream i'll make an argument as
as strongly as i can
and get you to agree with it and then
i'll show you the counterpoint
but that's usually during a live stream
because that doesn't that doesn't seem
manipulative that seems like more like
the show
but i wouldn't do it
uh
in an extended way like that
like i i wouldn't
i i'm legitimately just changing my mind
because i have new information there's
there's nothing going on beyond that
and by the way
anytime you see me change my mind
remember that that gives me freedom or
at least protection
from cognitive dissonance
do you all understand how that works
that the more you see me change my mind
in public like right in front of you
the less likely i'll be embarrassed to
do it again
right
because because i'm defining myself as
the person who can change his mind
that should
protect me against cognitive blindness
in some cases not all right there's
nothing you can do to protect yourself
entirely
but in theory i would be the most
maybe the most protected pundit
who does things publicly
i guess that makes you abundant
right
think think of somebody else that you've
watched
who has changed their mind on as many
topics as you've seen me change my mind
can you think of anybody
name one person who does this talk about
the headlines
who has changed somebody says my ex
steven crowder somebody says
talker oh actually talker
i'm going to give you that one i have
heard
tucker say he revised his opinion at
least
maybe three times i've heard it which
would be a lot
wouldn't it
yeah i'm gonna give you that one i'm
gonna give you a tucker
uh joe rogan changes his opinion i i may
be less familiar with
the examples of that but i would imagine
that's true
uh dave rubin famous example of somebody
who's who can see the whole field
by the way dave rubin is one of the best
examples of a talent stack
do you all know
dave rubin just
google him if you don't
but
i've never seen somebody do such a good
job of assembling exactly the right set
of talents to end up exactly where he is
which is in a real good place
china biden fauci own scott
who says that china biden and fouchy
owned me
like
based on what
i just think that there's some yeah i
have this thought that there are a lot
of paid trolls
but the people paying the trolls don't
know what they're getting
they're not really getting the good ones
i've got a feeling that if you're a paid
troll that like that's your job
you might not have a lot of talent
just saying all right um let's see what
else has happened with this uh
uh that's all that's all about that
um
did you know that china is already
russia's banker
i don't know exactly what that means but
the essence of it is that
getting russia out of the banking system
wouldn't have as much impact as you
thought
all right um
okay that's enough of that let's talk
about february 1st
um if you haven't noticed i'm trying to
talk less about
covid
everybody happy about that
i can't completely not talk about it
but i'll try to save it for the end and
i'll i'll try to de-emphasize it all
right so here's what i'm not going to
talk about
i'm not going to talk about what
therapeutics or vaccines are good or bad
amount
so the conversation of what works or
what doesn't work
i'm out
amount because i don't think it matters
at this point do you
is it relevant
i mean it just feels like the relevance
has disappeared you've all decided what
you're comfortable with
i've decided what i'm comfortable with
although i could change my mind
let's just call it good
yeah greg guffeld is
talks about february 1st so he would be
the best proponent
of the idea because
and as he often says on the show
if you don't tell the government what
you want how are they going to know
they can't guess
and they're not asking us
and so i think we've reached a situation
where so here's the current situation
nukova deaths in america are at an
all-time high
today
today
kova deaths are the highest they've ever
been
today
now
uh according to you know the cdc so yeah
you could argue about the numbers but
there were uh
3200 deaths on january 28th so there's a
little bit of a couple day time lag and
i think there's a weekend lag as well
so we won't know exactly what was
happening the last few days
until maybe middle of the week or
something
but
there's no way that the government can
relax restrictions when your deaths are
at an all-time high
everybody agree with that
that that there's nobody in the
government
who has enough cover with the data like
the data does not support them dropping
sanctions or dropping mandates
would you all agree with that if the
numbers are the worst ever
there's no way your government could say
okay numbers are worst ever take your
masks off because that would be like
saying they never worked in the first
place
and they can't say that
so
the only thing that can happen on
february 1st
is that the public just takes control of
the decision
and it's interesting because the if we
take control of the decision when the
deaths are at the highest they've ever
been
then there's a good chance it will hold
when they go down
and it might hold again when they go
back up to this level if that happens
again say in the summer or late summer
or something
so
i think the public has to take control
now
or let me say it a different way
i think the public will take control
and in a sense it's not really a change
because the public always had the
control of this stuff they always did
it's just they didn't
exercise it
um
and here's here's my opinion
if the public decides it's done with any
part of the mandates
we will be done with them
because we have the power
if you know 20 percent of people refuse
to put on a mask in walmart
what the hell is walmart going to do
what the hell are they going to do
they're not going to stop you from
shopping
they don't have the resources to kick
out 20 of the customers
and still have a business
so you don't need many people to refuse
you just need a date
and you need about 20 of the people to
say i'm going to die on this hill
because there's actually not that
there's no risk
you realize if you go into walmart
without your mass there's no risk i mean
legally there's no risk
the worst thing would happen is they'd
ask you to leave
or they'd ask you to put on your mask
that's it
that's it there's no penalty
you're not gonna let like be
taxed any extra
all right so do you think you can't get
20 of people to uh
to invite that trouble just to make a
point sure come on over manager let's
talk
yeah yeah in america
20 of the people will rebel against
anything
one of the things you can definitely
depend on
is americans willing to be rebellious
we're always willing to be rebellious
we love rebelling
we rebel three times before breakfast
we're a rebellious bunch of people
why not 25
with your 25 percent
all right so there's definitely there's
no there's no chance that your
government will really reduce mandates
on february 1st everybody on board with
that there's no chance
that masks will go away on february 1st
because the numbers are through the roof
compared to relative
but
let's see what the public can do
and you know here's here's my opinion on
this
i'm personally done with masks on
february 1st
meaning i just won't go or where they're
needed i won't fly
i'm just not going to fly
which is the one place i wouldn't be
able to get away with it right you
really couldn't fly
if there are mask requirements and you
don't have a mask
but short of that i can avoid everything
else i'll use only local businesses
because they're already mask free
largely
i'll avoid all chains
if i have to buy anything i'll buy it
online
through amazon
because you know what amazon never makes
me do
put on a mask
so if i want something from walmart
and they won't let me shop there in
person i'm not going to shop it from
walmart online
let me be clear
if walmart doesn't let me buy a
laundry basket at walmart
i'm not going to go online to the
 walmart online site and buy
their basket
i'm gonna get it from amazon
right
so
you know the public has a million
different ways that they can punish
businesses that don't want to
get on board so here's how it works
customers first that's you
corporation second
corporation second they have to buckle
you have to break the corporations
won't take much 10 20
of uh
malcontents in the store that's all it
takes
you break the corporations then the
corporations talk to the government and
then the government buckles
right you and i probably can't get the
government to do anything but you can
get a corporation to do a lot
you can get a corporation to do a lot
oh
damn it i hate it when i'm wrong
amazon owns whole foods
good point
amazon owns whole foods
now i think you still might want to
treat them as a separate company but
you know i i wouldn't go to amazon
whole foods to buy something i couldn't
get a safe way
but i would get a laundry basket from
amazon.com that i couldn't get
at target
all right so yeah
there's definitely some messiness there
in the corporate world but i think
that's the would you agree with the
general um
idea
that it's the public first
corporation second because they can make
that kind of a decision
and then
and then government last
right
because the minute that walmart says
we're not going to go along with this
anymore i feel like the government's
just got a cave
do you think the government could go
against walmart
i don't know might be hard i'll bet
there are some big corporations some
chains that have people who donate
to the political parties
so i've got a feeling that the at least
the ceos and the owners of big
corporations
they can push the government
uh dude you need to move to arizona
we've been optional for almost a year
now yes i am envious of the
the places in this country that are free
but i will tell you that as most of the
country is freezing to death
and suffering from iguanas falling on
their heads
today the high temperature where i live
will be 62 degrees
it will be completely sunny
and i will take a long walk in my
t-shirt
now if you can take a long walk in the
sun in your t-shirt
at the end of january where you live
let me know where that is
i might work there i might go there
now arizona of course is unlivable in
the summer
so you got to give me some place i can
go outdoors every month
austin maybe
i also need a legal cannabis so uh texas
is probably not my state
all right 70 degrees in phoenix nice
uh i'm not a two-home guy
i'll tell you
let me tell you the smartest thing i
ever heard from
craig of craigslist
you've all heard of craigslist right and
there's an actual craig
so i i've met craig
it turns out he was a dilbert fan
and uh
so anyway i had lunch with him once and
uh craig tells me the story about why
you turned down a gazillion dollars to
sell craigslist and instead
just worked for at least a long time he
worked customer support he just took
complaints that was his job at his own
company that he started he took
complaints
and which was hilarious and genius at
the same time
but i asked him like why why did you
turn down the gazillion dollars to buy
the company
and he said that being that rich sounded
like a lot of work
they hear somebody who creates a
craigslist and you say to yourself okay
what kind of a
like brain do you have to have to make
something that worked that well
well one of the parts of the brain you
have to have is simplicity
so here's somebody who craved simplicity
so much
that craigslist was just dead simple
right
wasn't the best thing about craigslist
how simple it was
no nobody had to have a lesson on how to
use it and this was in the days before
people understood user interface well
so the simplicity that allowed him to
build craigslist in the first place
you know
permeated his life and he actually
turned down i don't know a billion
dollars or whatever the number was some
big number because he thought it would
just make things complicated
and he already had all the money he
needed
and
that that's my two house
thing
could i afford to have two houses yes
yes i could
would it be awesome
to have two houses
where you're always in perfect weather
i think it would
that'd be pretty awesome
how much complication would that add to
my life
a lot
it would basically double my
complication there's no way i want to do
that
having one house is a giant pain in the
ass
i actually fantasize about renting
honestly
i fantasize about renting a two-bedroom
apartment someday and not having to do
like every day i have to do work to
support my house
like i work for my house it's basically
like a third job
i call a landlord
i pay people to work but i still have to
make all the decisions
i have to move stuff out of the rooms
it's just a lot
so yes i mean i'm not doing the physical
work so much
but it's every day all right
that ladies and gentlemen is all we've
got going on on a slow news day i wish i
could thrill you more
but
turns out that the news is not
cooperating today
hey
hello from nigeria
get a house manager
um i've had personal assistants
do you know why i don't have a personal
assistant now
because they make my life harder not
easier
it turns out that as soon as you have a
personal assistant they have problems
i'm like okay so now i've got a problem
with my house
but then i've also got a problem with my
employee
and the employee who's supposed to solve
the problem of the house can't do it
because they have their own problem
so now i went from one problem to two
problems
and i'm paying for it
i i'm paying like a lot of money to
double my problems
i i think hiring people to solve your
problems works at a certain scale
so at the elon musk scale it probably
works
i think he has multiple assistants
personal assistants i'm sure he has
somebody
taking care of his homes and stuff like
that or wherever he lives i don't know
what he's doing for home
but if you have like a whole staff
and you've got you know
somebody who's even managing the staff
and you've got enough people that one
could fill in when one is sick and all
that then it starts making sense like
you're actually like a little
corporation
but if you're an individual
even that high income
you don't want one employee
it's just a problem
if you had a bunch it might be a good
deal
yeah everything is about elon musk or
joe rogan have you noticed that
every topic is going to be about one of
them directly or indirectly
all right
and that
is all i've got today
what about the truckers
the truckers uh
are
very inspirational
and i think it had to come from somebody
in that um
socio-demographic group
don't you think because i don't think
the elites
can amount to revolution
you know the suburban moms
but you know if you get the truckers
involved that's some serious stuff and i
think everybody
it's weird how
that's right strong men
that's right the
the sensation of it
the sensation of it is that the
i hate to say it because it's sexist as
hell
but i'm going to speak of it as we are
biological creatures so now we're not
talking about what's
politically or socially appropriate
so leaving that domain for a second
we'll just go biology
biologically
you want the strong man to be leading
the revolution
it's just it just feels like it's not
serious until that happens
so we'll see
now that doesn't mean strong women
aren't driving trucks of course they are
doesn't mean that strong women can't run
a revolution i'm sure they can but
biologically we just feel like that's
somehow
more substantial
all right that is all i got for today
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
