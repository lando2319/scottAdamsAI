the stocks today it's a sleepy pre-
Thanksgiving Day so the markets are a
little bit quiet Tesla's up a little bit
o ult's up
3.37 Rumble down a little bit Microsoft
little bit down not bad all right let's
see what the uh comments look like on
locals before we get going
here all right looking good
looks like it's showtime
[Music]
huh good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human
civilization but if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that
nobody's ever understood with their tiny
shiny human brains all you need is a
copper muger glass a tanker Cher Stein a
pting Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine H the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go oh that's so
good
so well we got lots of
stories and they're almost all either
funny or good news
it's it's almost Thanksgiving you don't
want any bad news do you you want funny
stuff and good news all right well
here's some good science news Popular
Mechanics once again there's another
technology breakthrough in a power dense
battery that will charge you will give
you 186 mile charge in five
minutes and change how we drive forever
so that's coming it's Taiwan based EV
company
prologium is the world's first solid
state battery with silicon composite
anodes well I was waiting for that now
the reason I tell you about all these
battery technologies is not so you can
you know follow one company that made a
better battery but rather you can see
the Frantic pace of
development the world of battery
Improvement is just crazy now here's
another
one from uh new Atlas another fast
charging l iium sulfur
battery so that's cool um until now
they've uh suffered from low charge slow
charging and discharging but now they
figured out how to make it do all that
faster so there's probably how how many
times have I read you a story about a
new battery development maybe 15 15 or
20 and I don't know if any one of those
will take off and be the next big thing
but if any one of them works just any
one of
them it's going to be
huge and uh not only that but uh I keep
telling you about turning CO2 into other
products I'm not so sure that we need to
so there's the separate question is does
climate change require us to figure out
how to suck CO2 out of the air and turn
it into useful products I don't know but
it seems to me that every time we can
suck something out of the air and sell
it we're going to do it so so I think
whether or not climate change makes any
difference in terms of carbon capture if
we can economically suck things out of
the air like carbon and turn it into
fuels we're going to do it so here's
another
one the Oakridge National Laboratory if
got some improved Catalyst that turns
greenhous gases into cleaner fuels and
feed stocks so you can clean it and turn
it into all kinds of stuff
uh so that's coming you don't need to
know the details because they're not
important just know that there are
probably 20 places that they're turning
CO2 into products and probably at least
20 places they're turning batteries
making all new batteries that are better
and faster and lighter and faster
charging they don't blow up and all that
stuff big deals not only that but uh
according to the Sun the uh robotic
company called Figure figure
robotics um the founder is Brett
Adcock so the guy who's making humanoid
humanoid looking robots that have no
genitalia his name is
Adcock I'm not making that
up look at his damn robots they're
robots with no genitalia and no pants
I'm not making that up his name is
literally ad
do you think at any time you ever looked
at his robot and said there's something
missing
something I can't put my finger on it
what is wrong with these robots they
look humanoid but I feel like I need to
add something let me look at my
license oh I got it I got it we need to
add a
 but that's not why I bring it up
even though that would be perfectly
sufficient reason I bring it up because
remember I always complain about the
slow
robots it's like it doesn't matter if
you can train a robot to fold the shirt
if it does it like Joe
Biden if you give me three more hours I
will pick up a
shirt so that was a hilarious
demonstration that you can't see on
Spotify but according
to Mr ad
coock um these robots are now really
fast they're 400% faster so let me show
you 400% faster than
this it looks a little more like
this 400% faster still looks like a
robot but it's definitely faster
400% so we're getting
there well there's a big study on
marijuana and its relationship to
obesity what do you think they found
this will be a test to see if you're as
good as I am at determining what the
what the science should tell you right
they studied
obesity and marijuana use who do you
think used more marijuana the obese or
the not
obese
go the answer is the people who smoked
the most marijuana had the best weight
control didn't see that coming did
you do you know who knew
that me should have just
asked why is that well it's for a few
reasons that I believe I have spoken to
you before and written about number one
it's what I call the pleasure unit
hypothesis the pleasure unit hypothesis
is that if you're a human being you need
to find a certain minimum amount of
pleasure every day or else you might as
well just blow your head off because you
hate your life you have to have pleasure
to stay alive pleasure is not just the
little thing that sometimes you hope you
can get if you can't get any of it
ever well you're going to do something
drastic like become a mass murderer or
end your life or something but you can't
really go through life without any
pleasure and pleasure is um
substitutable so if for example you love
to play a sport but let's say you got
some injury so you couldn't play that
sport but you found another
sport it might be almost as good as the
first one so you can replace one
pleasure with another but here's another
thing you can replace food
pleasure I am convinced that the best
way to lose weight is to have other
pleasures
that don't hurt you such as enjoying a
sport or exercise or something else one
of the most direct substitutes to food
pleasure is
marijuana if you didn't know that now
it's also true that some people get the
munchies uh and maybe they'll eat a
little more junk food if they if they
have it but those who are regular users
learn that all they have to do is brush
their teeth or use mouthwash and that
that munchy thing just goes
away the other thing they'll find is
that if you're an adult and you want to
go to the
gym do you know how much better it is to
work out when you're a little bit
High 100% of people who have ever been
high will agree with this oh it's way
better it's way better better your brain
your body everything just works better
and you can exercise in a way that
I feel like otherwise you'd say I'm a
little sore I'm a little tired I already
work too hard I can't make it to the gym
today so one of the little secrets of
life is that if you see somebody who's
unusually in good shape after a certain
age probably half of them use weed to do
it probably
half it's just not obvious because they
don't talk about it there are other you
know obviously lots of people don't you
know maybe the other half but yeah it's
a big deal and so I'm not surprised at
all that that's
true
um however coincidentally The Drug
Enforcement Administration is going to
uh hold a formal hearing so this is
still under Biden and they're going to
have a formal hearing to see if they can
reschedule marijuana at the federal
level uh to make it schedule three so
that would be less illegal it would be
similar to ketamine and anabolic
steroids I don't know that feels roughly
directionally correct I don't think it
should be illegal but at least that's
directionally
correct um and why is this so important
well here's what's
important uh these robots are going to
be doing all of your
work and you're not going to have
anything to do except either eat or get
stoned
if you eat you'll get
unhealthy if you get high you'll go to
the gym so we're going to have to have
legal marijuana if we're going to have
robots doing all the
work am I kidding
no not even a little bit I'm not sure
you'd want to live in a world where
robots have all the
meaning you we get meaning from work
like our our sense of like value and who
we are and did contribute to the world
and have have you have you done anything
that anybody could respect today it's
mostly
work if we don't have to do that same
work because the robots are doing all
the hard stuff you're going to need
something you're going to need something
so uh joking aside we probably will be
doing a lot of mushrooms and DMT and
acid and marijuana it's my guess
probably less Al Al cuz that's bad for
you all right don't do drugs
kids don't do drugs if you're kid
there's you shouldn't do good drugs
anybody under
25 bad idea it's bad for your brain let
me say that
unambiguously all right
um did you know according to SST there's
a gut brain connection they found that
pro-inflammatory bacteria in your your
gut can change your brain and make you
depressed who knew that I did because
every change in your body changes how
you feel and it changes your depression
and as I've told you probably a 100
times without any science hey I think
inflammation might be the reason that
people are getting depressed so much
here it is so I've been saying this long
before there was any science to me it
just seemed how could it be true that
inflammation makes your body feel bad
wouldn't that make your brain feel bad
wouldn't it make you sad if you felt bad
all the time and of course it does of
course it does every now and then here's
here's
another I guess I probably shouldn't
tell you this in case you're saying kids
watching don't let your kids watch this
okay tell your kids to go
away this is not made for children um if
you're a certain age your body hurts
every day can can you verify that in the
comments let let's say people if you're
over 60 we we'll pick a random number if
you're over 60 would it be fair to say
that something about your body just sort
of hurts all the time you're a little
bit stiff you're a little bit tired
you're a little bit
something
right but every now and then and here's
where I hate to say it but legal
marijuana for adults not for you kids
not for kids um sometimes when I don't
have much that's
hurting and I'm under the influence of
marijuana I'll
have moments and sometimes hours in
which I don't have
pain and I'm talking about the little
pains you know just the Ordinary Pain of
life nothing nothing
extraordinary and I can tell you that I
am in almost a bliss happiness whenever
my body doesn't
hurt but as soon as something's bugging
me and it doesn't matter what it is you
know you could have a sore leg or a
headache or a sore back or anything and
all of a sudden your whole mood has
changed so this is why I keep telling
you your body is your brain they're not
separate units the the your attitude and
all the way you filter all of your
experience comes through the pain that
comes through your body so your physical
pain is what is completely changing your
subjective view of the world if you
don't go hard at getting rid of all your
physical
discomfort you're filtering the world
through basically
depression so work hard at losing that
weight don't drink that alcohol take a
walk after dinner and for God's sakes
take care of your body because that's
your happiness right
there speaking of that uh have I
mentioned that it looks like um Hulk
Hogan might be the Presidential Fitness
person at least he's been talked about
and I think Sylvester Stallone May is
also being talked about maybe both of
them maybe one of them and I just want
to put this idea out there as many times
as I can until it
happens walking is just the best thing
the world could do if you can turn
America into a walking country not
walking to work we don't need the
15minute cities everywhere instantly
although I like the idea just walking
just taking a walk after you eat if if
all you did is that let's say half of
the country said you know what let's
take a little walk around the house it
doesn't have to be very far we're
talking about like 20 minutes 20 minute
walk and if you do it after you eat
lowers your blood sugar which has all
kinds of benefits maybe you meet your
neighbors wakes you up a little bit
makes you feel like you did
something walking change your
life
anyway
um so Dr J
bakara looks like he's been uh tapped to
be the head scientist or the head of the
National Institute of Health now you
might say what's so special about that
Scott he's a highly qualified medical
professional in a job that requires
somebody like that well did you go
through the
pandemic turns out that uh the great
barington declaration that was written
by uh the good doctor vakara so he was
saying that we should just sort of power
through the um pandemic let people get
infected let them get immunity and it'd
be better than the vaccinations it seems
that uh time seems to have proven most
or all of what he said to be right and
the and his critics to be wrong and now
he has the ultimate Victory goes from
the guy who was wrong about everything
according to all the professionals who
were Liars to the guy who was right
about everything and now he's in
charge very trump-like
um third Act kind of situation wasn't it
I I I kind of like this just because the
the movie like feeling of victory that
it has you know as much as I liked my
own story of being you know completely
mocked in 2015 for saying Trump was
going to win and then when he does you
go yeah there you go there's your third
act story right there so uh
congratulations to Dr
Aria for doing the full third act he he
did the whole movie and I'll expect a
lot out of
them meanwhile the University of
Technology in Sydney says that the the
ocean stores water in a completely
different way than we thought or
additional way than we thought using
some kind of quantum physics that has
hadn't been completely
understood um so when the sun heats the
ocean it stores energy not only as heat
but as hybrid pairs of photons coupled
to oscillate water mut molecules I mean
you could have just asked me Scott is
the ocean storing the water just as heat
or is it also storing it as oscillating
water molecules well I thought heat was
oscillating molecules but accordingly
according to this there's more to
it and uh here's what I say about that
um how many times are we going to find
out that there's a major variable that's
missing in the climate models and then
we add it in and then they have to
adjust the model again to make sure it
says what it used to
say would that make you
suspicious that all the assumptions
going into the very complex models keep
changing and yet the models keep saying
the same thing hold on the inputs change
but then the output stays the same hm I
don't know what to think about that it's
almost like there's something sketchy
going on I don't know what it could
be well Mark Andre appeared on um The
Joe Rogan show and made quite a bit of
news turns out he's one of the most
interesting people in the
world uh which I knew because I've been
following it for a long time but the
rest of the world just found out I think
so here are some of the that Mark
Andre's saying just for your general
entertainment on Joe
Rogan he said to quote newspapers and by
the way a lot of this is from
um
from yeah I'll tell you in a second but
anyway he said quote newspapers have
been Scandal sheets forever he said the
first newspaper was a scandal sheet
about the Vatican it was all about
scandals with the Pope and the Bishops
Etc then here's the part I didn't know
Jefferson and Adams both own newspapers
and would use it to smear each
other Ben Franklin had 15 different sock
puppet Anonymous
accounts and have them argue with each
other in his
newspaper we've been in the world of
disinformation warfare for a very long
[Laughter]
time how many of you knew that during
the time of the founders the newspapers
were just completely
fake now I knew that but I didn't know
that uh I didn't know that Jefferson
Adams and Franklin all owned their own
newspaper let me see if I can put this
together so three of the most famous
Founders the ones that we Revere today
despite what flaws they might have had
we rever them as
Gods Not Gods but you know what I mean
and so their reputations are
excellent because the media of the day
said that they were awesome excellent
people except wait a minute they were
the media of the
day so according to the people who own
the
newspapers they're pretty
awesome is it possible that the founders
were a bunch of bastards and and the
only reason that we rever them is
because they all know newspapers and and
we didn't know until until Mark andreon
told us we didn't know that all of our
history was fake news written by the
people who were in the news who also
owned the
newspapers
ah yes ladies and gentlemen if you
believe that Walter kronite was telling
you the real news but we've lost what we
had
you think
so do you think there was a long period
where news went from completely fake to
well we're trying as hard as we can to
get this story right or there's no
tricks here and then then went to our
current situation of you know complete
propaganda and
brainwashing do you think it really went
through
that I think it went through completely
fake and then it just healed itself
because there was no reason for it to f
fix itself we weren't even complaining
nobody was complaining what was the
problem we don't fix problems we don't
have and nobody was saying the
newspapers are fake
[Music]
so no we've never had real news not only
we have never had real news there's no
way it was even possible to have real
news because there was nobody in the
real news business nor would it make
sense to be in that business because the
fake news business p pays really well or
if you're a billionaire you don't care
if it pays well it just says good things
about
you so yeah news has always been fake
and all of your history is fake too uh
but here's some more news that Andre
made he said uh he knows of 30 Tech
Founders who were secretly
debanked
what there were 30 Tech
Founders that at least were prominent
enough that they came to the attention
of Mark
Andre and all of them were
debanked for
what sounds sketchy doesn't it do you
think they were debanked because they
supported Harris and
Biden probably not I'd certainly like to
know a little bit more about why they
got debanked wouldn't you because that
sounds pretty
suspicious um
and then my favorite is Zed andreon says
uh now it's hard to know if he means
this
literally or as a recreational belief
you know I I tell you that some things
are just fun to believe but I don't take
them too
seriously um so Mark says there have
been two major timeline splits in the
last nine months suggesting that
reality you know could have gone two
different ways and maybe
did he said one was the assassination
attempt on
Trump
yep one inch and history would have been
really
different so Mark thinks that maybe
history split into two
timelines and that unavailable to us is
that other timeline that really went
poorly but on top of that he thinks the
election itself might have been a
timeline split
boy it did feel like it didn't it I feel
like I woke up in a different reality
after the election did anybody have that
feeling like actually that reality had
changed
because there was this whole fake
reality like this
theatrical support of Harrison
Biden that seemed like theater and none
of us seemed real and they would say
things about how awesome she was and I'd
say I'm not seeing it
and then she would look drunk and I'd
say hey there she is looking drunk again
and people would say like I wasn't even
saying it or was it like it wasn't
real and then suddenly you wake up and
all the Democrats are saying oh I guess
we got basically everything wrong and
then suddenly my world made perfect
sense I mean I guess it made sense
before if if you were really paying
attention it made sense but for the
people who weren't paying attention it
started to make sense wait are you
saying that half of the world was just
completely hypnotized and or lying to
itself yes yes that's exactly what was
happening half of the world was
hypnotized and
brainwashed and or lying to itself
that's exactly what was happening and
when you wake up with that realization
that now everybody knows it it's a
different reality I mean you couldn't
things couldn't be more different than
they were a few weeks ago that's what it
feels like to
me so does that mean that we're in a
simulation and that the timeline is
split I don't
know but I do know
this Mar andreon is on a very short list
of people who are going to get a package
with a plaid blanket in
it
someday
maybe because there can only be one
those of you who understood that
reference are having a good laugh those
of you who have no idea what I'm talking
about are
confused but someday you won't be
someday you'll know what that
meant all right so as you know um Trump
talked to the president of Mexico
Claudia Shin bomb and I will never get
tired of saying the president of Mexico
Claudia shine balb
I just love
that so Claudia shine bomb is one of
these
people who reminds us that there's
nothing stopping women from having you
know any leadership
Office right there really isn't it just
has to be the right person and then we
vote for them and that's all it is
that's the whole story so she ran people
liked her they voted for and and what
you would think would be the most you
know patriarchal country you could think
of Mexico oh you're good at your job
carry
on everybody likes capability and
competence more than they
like theater everybody does you just got
to prove that you have the stuff I guess
she did or she had the cartels on her
side or something but it
worked anyway um she said that uh the
that the uh the big Caravans are
stopping I don't know if that's true or
it's way
down and she said um that Trump's you
know 25 his threat that he'd put a 25%
tariff on Mexican
Imports um but you know she would of
course say that she's already doing
stuff to work on that so he doesn't need
to do that and she asked this question
she said car well she said Caravans and
migrants no longer reach the Border
and I feel like that's true because the
news hasn't been focusing on Caravans so
they must be way
down
um and they she said that they're trying
to curb the flow of drugs I don't
believe any of that
um but then she said maybe maybe
president Trump doesn't know this now
keep in mind that she calls him
president
Trump she does not call him president
elected Trump
now maybe it was just a slip but our
vice president seems to be drunk in FL
in Hawaii and our our real president at
the moment seems to be I don't know
missing or dead or God knows what so
when the president of Mexico talks to
Trump and refers to him she calls him
the
president because for all practical
purposes for her world he's already the
president so she just uses that term
but she says she wonders if he knows
that uh
um that most of the people who are
coming in now uh half of them have a
cbp1
appointment so that means that they have
an app on their phone in which they have
negotiated with some some entity in the
United States through the government to
have a secure job when they get here in
other words there's some American entity
of farm let's say who says we we'd like
a bunch of people to pick our crops so
they use the app and then a bunch of
people sign up and maybe you can tell
something about them from the sign up
and then they show up and they work and
then in theory they go home when they're
done but you could probably track them
I'm I'm very much in favor of the app I
I don't know if the app has reached you
know the point of usefulness that needs
to get to or not
but I always thought that it needed to
be an
app yeah I've been saying it for years
we should have an app for the ones who
want to be here legally because if you
have an app you could probably also be
tracked and anybody who would sign up
for a legal app which of course makes
their phone trackable if you would sign
up for that and you're really going to
work you're already into the category
where I'm likely to trust you now of
course people could abuse the system and
a terrorist could come in that way I
suppose but they could get in anyway so
I like the
app but um I don't know what's happening
with the migration from other countries
but it does look like Mexico wants to be
useful and try to work with
Trump um oh the Vigilant Fox was the
account that I wanted to tell you uh a
lot of a lot of today's story stories I
saw for the first time through on act
through the Vigilant
Fox so that's a good follow so I
recommend them the Vigilant Fox lot lot
of the independent news that you're not
necessarily going to see on the regular
news the good stuff anyway there's some
uh social media influencer a Democrat
called Hassan perer apparently he's huge
in social media for people on the left I
had not heard of him and then when CNN
was asking him you know what should the
Democrats have done
differently um he said well I think they
need to change their
policies and CNN said it's a policy
thing and Hassan said yes it's 100% a
policy thing and cenan said what will
solve the problem well he said what will
solve the problem is if the Democratic
party actually adopts real left-wing
economic populist messaging instead of
purposely avoiding that stuff because
they're terrified of upsetting their
corporate
owners so CNN who doesn't know why the
Democrats lost went to a young social
media influencer who also doesn't know
why the Democrats lost but his theory is
if they'd said more of the things that
voters hate they would have
won do you think that Americans wanted
to hear more populist economic socialist
policies no that's why they lost
I'm pretty sure that's that's a big part
of why they lost is all those popular
policies no they hid their real policies
because if they hadn't hid them they
would have lost 90% to
10%
now the the people on the
left who are willing to
talk are really really
confused have you ever seen anything
like this
um after 2016 I I mocked CNN because
they had some they had a list of 14
reasons that um Hillary Clinton
lost 14 reasons which meant that 14
things she did wrong or could have done
better or got
unlucky and now commonly Harris loses
how many reasons have you heard for why
she lost it's about 14 isn't it it's
over 10 it's probably some between 10
and 20 reasons that be given for why she
lost how many times can you lose for 10
to 20 reasons and not be able to correct
that well I'll tell you what it really
is what it really is is that they can't
identify the one or two problems like
they don't have the skill to know what
what were the main things now I do think
that James
Carville does possess that skill
there there are a few Old-Timers like uh
Bill Clinton I think he still has that
skill even that is current age and also
current age uh U Carville but none of
the young people seem to have any of
those skills they seem to not be able to
identify um what's important or what
would be a big lever you know where to
put your money what what button to push
they seem to be just in random territory
like they understand something some
basic things about Humanity or the
country or the average person it's like
they're completely disconnected from
some kind of larger
reality how are they going to fix that I
don't think they
will the the only thing that would fix
the Democrats would be a trump-like
character emerging out of nowhere who
was
so what would you call Trump well
besides persuasive maybe that's all it
is persuasive you would need somebody
who had you know balls of steel or lady
balls of steel let's not be sexist and
was completely provocative wanted to
make big
changes and could talk the talk they
don't really have that person and I
would argue that the Republicans would
be completely lost without
Trump have you ever thought of that
what what would the Republican Party
look like if you took Trump out and you
replaced with whoever you think was the
second best person for the last eight
years well it wouldn't be
winning you could say that for sure they
wouldn't be winning anything you you
would still think the news was real you
would still be trapped in your
brainwashing little little cone of
 Trump is the one who taught you
that everything's not real
it took a showman to tell you you were
in the
show I need to tell you something that
happened when I when I met
Trump
because this is my interpretation of
it but when I first met him he was
sending off a funny tweet and I got to
actually watch in real time as he
dictated the Tweet to Dan scavino at the
time who was doing the actual physical
typing of the tweet and I got to watch
him
actually um create one from
scratch and then he threw in uh
something like your favorite President
so that the end of the Tweet was
something like your favorite President
which I always loved when he threw that
in there because he knew it was just to
bother the other
side it was just wonderfully it was just
wonderfully tongue and
cheek and then I think I said something
about how much I liked when he did his
impression of his standard president you
know back in the first election he he he
would go I'm not a standard president
here is a standard president you know
you do his physical
impression and so when I first met him I
don't remember what the trigger was but
I said about him that his critics don't
understand the
show and my experience was that he
locked his eyes onto me
and he gave me that there we go like you
get it from that moment on we were
totally
bonded because as soon as I recognized
that he brings the
show it's the
show if if you don't understand it as a
show then you're lost then then you
think oh my God he's he's Hitler nothing
makes sense but if you know that he
brings the show and that the show has
been let's say weaponized to become
useful in politics but also useful for
the country then you understand
everything that he's using the
show to make real things work in the
real world and when I demonstrated that
I understood the show boom connected
that moment it was a kind of a cool
moment but I think that's what the
Democrats don't understand at all that
Trump is not just good at what he does
he's historically good at what he does
like there might not ever be another one
of those you know I mean there might be
if you weit long enough
but his his ability to penetrate reality
rewrite it I I like to talk about what
he did to the Republican
Party he came in as an exd Democrat who
was reviled by basically everybody in
the Republican party as this you know
Outsider carpet baggot kind of guy
trying to trying to Elbow his way into
power and not having the you know the
background and everything that justified
it and then he did it he he actually
hollowed out the Republican party and
wears it like a suit he didn't see that
coming did you so when you say what
would the Democrats need to
do they would need to have an
historically
gifted persuasive Democrat who did not
say the same dumbass Progressive things
that they've been saying so far because
nobody wants to hear it they would come
up with a better message one that made
sense and then would go sell the heck
out of it and then suddenly all their
problems would be solved they have bad
ideas because they have bad leaders and
they bad
communication Democrats at the moment
are actually bad at every every element
of politics compared to Trump but
also this is is a big
key and I say this a lot but the
Democrats haven't figured this out yet
what Trump built without trying was this
uh this Army of influential people who
were unusually
credible unusually credible people who
you said to yourself I don't think that
person's lying to me and they're saying
things I'm not seeing hearing on CNN so
you know again this would be everybody
from you know Elon Musk to the all-in
Pod guys to Mike cernovich Jack pabic
you know I could keep naming names but
they uh a a an army of independent right
leaning
Minds Rose they rose out of nothing and
now it's because the internet allowed it
right but the the rise of the let's say
the um
let's call it almost like a guiding
force that Trump uses productively
meaning that if Trump came up with an
idea that all of the let's say the top
20 um independent voices said was a
terrible idea I think he'd pull it back
by the end of the day what do you think
and I think we've seen it I can't think
of an example but I think we've seen it
where he floats an idea
and if the smartest people say uh not so
much it just goes away but if the
smartest people say yes it doesn't
matter what else is says
no if if if the people that he trusts
and he knows have been Smart in a
variety of different situations and
they're all on the same page about
whatever it is he's probably going to
push right through that and make that
work oh
Jenny keep yelling at me in all capital
letters is somebody paying you you look
like a PID troll somebody wants me to
know that solar will never work in all
capital letters I must scream at you
solar will never work now Jenny do you
think I don't understand the
concept that things can start as
inefficient and later become useful
Jenny do you know when the um the uh
batteries the lithium batteries were
invented do you know when they were
invented
Jenny it was in the
80s they're just getting good and
they're probably a quarter as good as
they will be in a few
years so when you say to me Jenny solar
will never be anything solar will never
work you're first of all disagreeing
with the smartest person you know Elon
Musk and secondly you are ignoring that
oil technology is largely about the same
give or take fracking whereas Battery
Technology and solar are improving in
Leaps and Bounds and there's no chance
in the world they won't
overtake at least
oil nuclear power might you know beat it
forever I don't know but no Jenny you
need to do a little bit better and then
stop yelling at all caps and bothering
us in the middle of our delightful live
stream so go back talk to somebody smart
stop taking money from the oil companies
and uh get back on
board all right
um I love more stories about the
Democrats being in in
chaos so uh Michael Moore has said that
uh he he thinks that Biden's a war
mongerer and he can't believe
as as many Trump supporters can't
believe that Biden is looking to push as
much money out the door for Ukraine's
military as possible instead of just
waiting for Trump to wrap it
up imagine being Michael
Moore and probably at the very top of
the things you want to avoid would be
nuclear
war and I'm going to give that to
Michael Moore Michael Moore is an
interesting character like I I'm very
big on
trying to praise the good parts of
public figures I mean if they have
something they offering of value I don't
want to throw everything else away
because because there's something I
don't like that they said let's keep the
good parts here's a good part Michael
Moore says why why why are we letting
our lame deck president be a
warmonger yes Michael Moore we agree
Michael Moore let me ask you this
question given that Trump already won
and you agree
one don't you think we'd be better off
if Trump just started negotiating now
and ended that
war are we on the same page I think we
are right are we on the same page with
Michael Moore that every every penny we
give to Ukraine from now on is a waste
of money because both sides have already
pretty much conceded that it's time to
talk it out so yes same page Michael
Moore so I'm I'm going to give Michael
Moore complete credit because he went
against his team the Democrats and he
called out a thing that has always been
his top priority and what they're doing
doesn't make sense if you're a Democrat
so full credit to Michael Moore on this
specific
point and uh Jesse Waters I guess is
reporting he says there's some
Rumblings that Bernie Sanders might try
to create another party because the
Democrats are so bad I don't think
that's going to happen because of his
age
and they would probably have him
murdered a Democrat strategist James
Carville um says the Democrats quote
don't even know where the freaking light
switch
is so this is what Carville is becoming
one of my favorite guilty
pleasures I do
love the you know the directness the way
he chooses his
words he says quote people will call me
and say do this or do that but I'm
trying to find the light switch here
dude and I can't the wall is blank right
now but I'm it's it's we're fooling
around in the dark here that I
know so you can tell that U you can tell
that Carville is at least ahead of the
crowd right so he's admitting he doesn't
he doesn't have the answer but he knows
he doesn't have the answer
and he knows there's no light switch
there there's there's no available
answer so he's way ahead of his you know
Democrat crowd because they think they
have the answer like I think it was that
that time she didn't go on Joe Rogan
yeah that's it if only Joe Rogan had
been better at scheduling everything
would be
different I'm sure they G because the
staff is already blaming it on Joe Rogan
that's the latest they're like oh we
totally wanted to do it but but you know
Joe Rogan he was hard to work
with we couldn't get it
scheduled
no so no only only James Carville knows
that literally everything is broken on
their side
everything um so it just keeps getting
better so there's a story that
MSNBC the staff is unhappy because they
learned from the news that one of their
own Al Sharpton you know one of the
major voices on
MSNBC uh that he his his quote charity
his charity took a half a million
dollars from uh K Harris before he gave
a softball interview to her on
MSNBC and even the MSNBC people are
saying what the
 what are you kidding me I work for
a news organization and one of our news
people took half a million dollars for
his charity before he gave her a puff
piece and we call ourselves
news so it seems to me
that and I think this is funny there
must have been some number of MSNBC
employees who thought they were working
for a real news
organization is that funny or is it just
me I think it's funny that there were
people who worked at MSNBC who didn't
know what MSN MSNBC is if if they
thought they were working for a news
entity this would really
sting if they knew that it was never
meant to be news it's just propaganda
then does it matter if this guy gets
rich off it I don't
care it doesn't bother me at all what
what I want to know is that he took the
money that's all just just tell me he
took the money and then I have no more
questions because now I can ignore his
interview because I know it's not a real
interview
and um apparently no laws were
broken it was disclosed so if he didn't
break any
laws and it tells me what I need to know
oh I don't need to watch this because
it's not real that's everything I need I
have no complaints whatsoever but
imagine if you were working there and
you thought you were working at like a
legitimate news
entity
oops now that's funny just funny to
think that the employees are finding out
what you and I have known forever that
that it never was
real anyway according to uh Harry um
Harry Inon on CNN one of my favorite
characters on CNN um what makes him fun
is that when he says stories that are
pro Trump he says them with the same
enthusiasm as if he were doing any other
news which is a lot of enthusiasm he's
great on TV
so watching him not try to hide the fact
that there's something in the Trump
world that's working out well you know
while while the CNN host is always
nervously standing there saying God I
wish he'd stopped saying good things
about Trump I just imagine that I don't
know if they're really thinking it
anyway he says that uh Dei is sinking in
popularity really quickly and uh the
public interest and is collapsing down
15 points since 2021 but among
Republicans support for Dei has
plummeted from 50% to
22% and even Democrats are less
supportive of a de with a dip from 86 to
79 uh
Harry a little message to Harry
Anon um I love your work you're great on
TV um but I'm going to put down a
hypothesis
when you say that public interest
meaning I guess favorability and Dei is
down with Republicans from 50% to
22% do you think that's because they
changed their
minds Harry Harry do you think that that
change is because the Republicans
changed their minds is that why it's
down no
it's because they can say it now they
can say it out loud that's why it's down
there was no 50% support for Dei
among Republicans are you crazy you
don't know a single Republican who was
in favor of Dei do you do
you I'm asking you right now watching do
any of you know even one even
one anywhere Republican who is Pro Dei
no you don't you don't even know
one so as great as Harry Inon is and I
think he is genuinely uh genuinely
interested in getting the real answer
you know not not the fake answer I think
you have to take into consideration that
people just felt comfortable saying
it and there is no 22% among Republicans
support for
Dei that's not true it's zero
and always has been you're not a
republican if you're in favor of it you
couldn't be and so basically you should
say there are 22% fake
Republicans that would be closer to the
truth I don't know if uh I don't know if
de is that um popular still with
Democrats but I would believe it seems
believable right so one of the uh one of
the tips for spotting bull that
I often give you is when your direct
observations don't match what the
science or the poll is telling you that
should mean something so when the polls
were saying it looks like Harris is
going to have a good day but all of my
lived experience was the opposite I said
to myself huh seems like the scientific
part the polling is not matching my
direct observation now in this case I
went with my direct observation
turned out that was the right
move
um yeah so anyway direct
observation is uh probably
uh probably really going to tell you a
lot all
right um Mike Benz is telling us that
maybe that fight that Brazil was having
with Elon Musk over starlink may have
been not what we thought it was it
looked like they were mad at Elon Musk
because of censorship and the xplatform
and but they were going to take it down
on his starlink just because they could
well now we find out that there was a
Chinese competitor to starlink that was
trying to get into Brazil at the same
time huh
so was that all about making sure the
Chinese competitor got in there is
Brazil operating under bribes
did China bribe the Brazilian government
to keep starlink
out I'm going to say
probably I I I don't have any direct
evidence but
probably sounds reasonable to me I mean
if you had to bet on it you'd probably
Bet On
It um Elon Musk agreed with this thought
also from Mark Andre on uh Joe Rogen
show so Andre was saying the future Wars
are all going to be about drones and
Hypersonic missiles and that fighter
jets piloted by humans would all be
destroyed in the first minutes of a war
at least between the most capable
countries here's why whenever you do a
simulation where um you've got a jet
that's driven by Ai and a jet that's
driven by human the AI wins every time
because it's smarter and it doesn't have
to worry about you know G forces or any
of those things
so probably our skies will be drained of
human Pilots fairly quickly and all
future Wars are going to look like
drones and Hypersonic missiles
now as somebody smart pointed out um
when Putin used his new Hypersonic
missile uh the news reported it as uh oh
he could put a nuke on that thing and
then we'd be in real trouble somebody
smart harder pointed out oh no it's
worse than
that if you think him putting a nuke on
his Hypersonic missiles that apparently
we don't have any way to shoot down if
you think that's the risk here's the
real risk those are like rods of Steel
they go so high up that all they have to
do is come straight down and the kinetic
energy will destroy just about
anything
so meaning if they can make a lot of
them we can't stop a single one of them
so if they made let's say 100,000 of
them and launched
them whoever their target country is
would lose a
100,000 large
resources like the whole
airport or like the
Pentagon so if we got into a kinetic war
with Putin and he had lots of those
things we don't know Happ he has um he
doesn't need any nuclear nuclear would
be stupid because if it triggered
nuclear then we'd go nuclear then he'd
lose too but if he just goes kinetic he
just wins go you know in theory we don't
have something that encounter it now in
reality we would threaten
nuclear right because we'd have to if it
looked like we got into war and we're
going to and his missiles were taking
out all of our good stuff and we
couldn't do anything of that nature
I think we would threaten nuclear and
then work it out so I'm not worried
about Putin starting World War
II and I'll say it as many times as I
need to I I completely understand that
he's signaling in every way that he
might go
nuclear that's just what he's supposed
to be doing if he were not doing that I
would say oh he's not a very good leader
he doesn't know the obvious thing he
should be doing but if you watch a
leader doing the obvious thing you
should be doing
and not being crazy and the obvious
things seem to be working for Putin then
any notion that he's crazy or he wants
to blow up the world with nuclear power
he's winning he doesn't need to blow up
anything all he has to do is just keep
beinging Putin and things are going to
work out fine it looks like looks to me
so when you see that people say this is
the most dangerous time we've ever been
in I understand what they're saying
because Putin is signaling in the most
dangerous way he's ever signaled and the
weapons are stronger than they have'
ever been and there's an actual Hot
War if you just wrote that down on a
paper that would sound like the most
dangerous situation you've ever been in
I get
it but here's the part that overrides
all of that all he has to do is wait a
few weeks and he gets everything he
wants who would launch a nuclear war if
all he had to do is smoke a bong and sit
your couch for two weeks and get
everything you want nobody nobody not
Putin not anybody there's literally
nobody would launch a nuclear strike
under these current conditions it is the
least likely time that anyone would ever
go nuclear
intentionally now does it create the
chance of an
accidental nuclear
launch probably no and here's why if I
were Putin and again remember he's smart
he's not crazy if I were Putin here's
what I'd do I'd go to my Nuclear forces
and I'd say here's the deal I'm going to
scare the hell out of the west but you
guys don't fall for anything I'm saying
we are not going to go nuclear and if I
hear that any one of you made a move
that makes it look like we're going
nuclear and it didn't come directly for
me I'm going to kill
you because you don't want to you are
not going to send the any signal that
I'm not s sending right I don't want to
know that something somebody started
lighting something up I don't want to
see that something went to Defcon 2 what
whatever their version
is if you're Putin you've called in your
nuclear people and you said you can't
make a move like you've got to be the
quietest little mouse in the world and
and then I would also make sure that my
hotline was working so can somebody test
this red phone here because if the
goes down I want to be on the phone with
Biden or Trump right away so it's
possible I know it's not 100%
sure that we're the safest we will ever
be in the history of the
planet right
now it might be the safest we will ever
be or ever have been because remember
when when the world was primitive your
tribe was going to get overrun by you
know the Huns or something so we might
be safer than any time in all of human
history even in the middle of a hot
War so there's
that
um so according to Jennifer Griffin Fox
News um I guess the US has military
bases in the UK and those those bases
are getting um surveilled by some kind
of drones and we don't know whose they
are they don't appear to be hobbyist
drones and they're definitely not
American and the British say it's not
them I mean they're hosting us in their
they're hosting us in their bases
wouldn't make sense for them to be doing
it but they don't know who it
is there's there's no sense that they're
you know uaps or anything alien so
presumably
they're some other power that knows that
they can get away with these drones
I don't know how they can't knock one
down and figure out where it came from
but that's the story so maybe it's fake
news never
know there's a study I've been waiting
for this one um but I tell you that I
should tell you in advance all data that
comes out about the
pandemic none of it's credible for a
variety of reasons so I'm going to tell
you a study but at the same and it will
be one that you already agree with so
it's a study where you can say see I
told you I knew it but
remember all the news that was against
you before that was all
fake so don't assume that the news that
agrees with you is suddenly magically
correct there is no credibility to
anything coming out of the pandemic
nothing not not if it agrees with you
not if it doesn't agree with you nothing
now some of it will be right but you
won't know you won't have any way to
know
so there's a study of unvaccinated
Americans so there were a lot of people
who got no vaccinations not just because
of the pandemic um Let me clarify this
is not about the pandemic these are
vaccinations for your whole life so
apparently there are a number of people
who have never been vaccinated even in
childhood and if you track them down you
can compare their results to um regular
people and they say the data is clear
the people who got the most ordinary
vaccinations we're not talking about Co
not talking about Co we're talking about
childhood vaccinations that the people
who got the most of them had the most
chronic
illnesses does that make
sense
well here are the questions I would ask
number one what else do these people
have in
common if you if you never got any
vaccination
who are you and where do you live you're
probably kind of Off the Grid a little
bit because you couldn't have gone to
public
school so if you took the people who
lived off the
grid and were so concerned about things
that they didn't have any vaccinations
not even childhood
vaccinations what else would you be
doing right would you be growing your
own
food would you be making sure you guys
exercise in vitamin D would you be just
generally more aware of Health um from
more of a a hippie organic sense I don't
know so this is a data I want to
believe because I wouldn't be surprised
at all if chronic illnesses are coming
from some combination of childhood
vaccinations I don't know because I
don't believe any data at this point but
uh it's an interesting one well
meanwhile KL Harris appeared for the
first time on video um everybody who's
commenting on it that I've seen suggests
that she seems obviously
inebriated if you haven't seen it take a
look she seems clearly drunk or on pills
or on something now unless that's
altered and I haven't seen any news that
says it's altered yet it could be so so
keep on guard somebody might tell you
it's altered but if it's not altered
she's obviously
inebriated and are we going to do this
thing where this is what I worry about
we're going to do this thing where we
act like we're suddenly discovering
it did did you watch me go through a
full year of saying she's drunk or
inebriated it's obvious why am I why is
this not in the news why is NBC not
mentioning she's obviously
drunk and and now that she's not going
to be the president are we going to hear
all The Insider stories about how how
she was feing for a drink and you know
somebody got to give her a pill every
day and nobody knew what she was on you
know that's coming
right isn't that the most predictable
thing in the world the the Insiders are
going to start dumping under under
substance use because I think we're at
the point where we don't have to wonder
if she's
inebriated are you with me on that
okay do we agree yet that the question
is she inebriated in a number of these
appearances and especially in this video
that feels
confirmed I I don't think that's
something you have to debate about
anymore anyway um and then she she does
her word salad thing where she doesn't
look sincere at all she just looks drunk
and she goes I have to remind you don't
you ever let anybody take your power
from you
you have the same power that you did
before November 5th no Trump took
your power you had power Trump took it
Trump took your power shut up you
lost yes somebody can take your power
Trump took it try to get it back see
what he can
do well it seems that Harris and Biden
have both decided to silently quit or do
the quiet quitting you know Corporate
America that there's that thing where uh
you quit by just not doing the work but
you keep getting
paid quiet
quitting weird um there's there's some
really weird drunk people in the
comments today a lot of morning drinkers
today anyway so the quiet quitting has
happened and yet seems to be fine
because it looks like Trump has filled
the uh the power vacuum it seems like
the other countries already know they
need to talk to Trump so and it's a
holiday so nothing's going to happen
anyway so I think they all say ah let's
just wait for the holidays to be over
we'll be fine we will be
fine have you ever heard of the National
Endowment for
democracy the Ned the National Endowment
for
democracy now if Mike Benz did not exist
I never would have heard of it but um
apparently back in the old days when the
you know the CIA would try to control
other
countries and you know that was sort of
bad behavior and they didn't want to be
seen as controlling other countries so
apparently what they did is they created
this National Endowment for democracy so
that the CIA funds this entity or the
government does and then then through
this entity they give money to groups
that are like let's say against the
government
locally so basically you can conquer
most countries if you have more money
than they do right so we can't conquer
China by you know creating dissident
groups because China is too powerful
they just wrap them up and kill them all
but if you have a smaller country where
maybe their government isn't so
coordinated this National end Endowment
for democracy can fund money to all the
all the people who might agree with us
and want to overthrow the country and
it's enough if you can control their
news probably that's all you need and
how how expensive would it be to control
the news in a small country not very
hard it's not hard in our country so it
can't be hard in the small country
so as Mike Ben says if I told you the
CIA cutout now CIA cutout means somebody
who's doing the work of the CIA but
they're not under any CIA umbrella right
they're a cutout so they pretend to be
doing some separate Mission but it's
really for the benefit of the CIA so the
CIA cown is currently in the process of
trying to sink its censorship fangs into
140 countries so right now this National
Endowment for democracy is trying to
influence what the citizens in 140
countries are allowed to see on the news
and on social
media wow you know on one on one hand
I'm
impressed I like the fact that I live in
a country where our smart people figured
out that we can control other countries
by controlling the
Press I like that because it's you know
I live in the country that figured that
out and we had the money to do it so of
course we're doing it seems to be
working out um but here's the problem
in what world do you imagine they're not
doing it to
us if they would do this publicly like
it's all disclosed if they would do this
to 140
countries you think none of this is
happening in the United States and it
would be done the same way it wouldn't
be the CIA saying don't do this there
would be cutouts there would be cutouts
there would be like a fact checking
cutout or news checking cutout
but same process just like
here yeah 141 countries
right all right I was reading an article
on tip
insights that's a site website tip
insights
um it must be somebody named tip because
there's two PS TI PP insites all one
word anyway so was they were looking at
the election results from 2016 2020
2024 trying to figure out was there any
obvious cheating in
2020 well now that we have a better idea
of how many of the total votes will be
uh we can see that Trump in 2024 got
about 78 million
votes um Harris was around 76 now I'm
rounding off to make things simple but
Biden got
81
million do you believe that in
2020 Biden got 81 million but Harris
only got
76 do you believe that do you believe
that the so-called uh the the districts
that are the bellwethers meaning that
wherever whichever way they go the
national elections going to go and would
you believe that uh Trump won 19 of the
bellwethers and somehow lost the
election which is basically impossible
now you're going to say to me Scott
Scott Scott Scott don't fall for that um
those Bell weathers are not the same as
they used to be because the the changing
demographics so yes maybe maybe these 20
Bell weathers did predict in the past
but now that the demographics have
changed probably they never will
again except
guess what happened in
2024 the Bell weathers predicted exactly
what would happen
again so the Bell weathers worked every
year except
2020 huh and the most votes we've ever
seen for
Democrats were for a guy who couldn't
walk or talk and we never saw
him and then when KLA Harris ran who was
was not only black vagina
Jesus but you know was backed by all the
same numbers people Etc and by then they
maligned Trump into being an
insurrectionist with with 34 felonies so
they lawar Trump out of like like crazy
so he's lawed all this legal stuff then
the Insurrection stuff on top of it just
non-stop fake news fake fake racism news
fake sexism news just just absolutely
the worst and after all of
that she still got fewer votes than he
did by a
lot and and Biden would have killed them
just by staying in the
basement none of this is
believable it's not um and then
apparently the polling uh consistently
underperforms for Trump but not for
Harris or Biden so the polling seems to
be consistently accurate for everybody
except Trump who always exceeds the
polling uh that would suggest that there
might be some secret Trump supporters or
that the polling is intentionally rigged
or that the pollsters don't know how to
capture that that
base or all of those
things so let's see we've got an unusual
number of votes that can't be explained
in
2020 we've got 19 out of 20 bellwethers
that flipped the wrong
direction and
then everything in the news should have
buried Trump by that point but worked
the opposite he did better than he' done
and then the January 6
committee um they investigated all this
stuff and they never asked the question
why did tens of thousands of trump
supporters gather at the ellipse on that
day now that's that's an interesting
question so you do this January 6 thing
to find out hey what happened on that
January 6th day and the question that
they never looked
into was why did so many
people have enough of a problem that
they were willing to risk jail to go
there and cause trouble because they
they had to know that there was a risk
of
jail maybe it's CU they saw what Trump
saw that the numbers looked obviously
faked and of course there was also that
spike in spike in some places just at
the right time at the last minute so I
feel at this
point it would be accurate to say that
2020 was
rigged and that we don't need to look at
it
anymore that that to me that feels like
a comfortable fact I don't know how they
did it might have been and the mail in
votes or something else I don't know I
don't know why it didn't happen again
maybe because Laura Trump and Watley uh
did a great job of getting people to
watch all the right places maybe that's
all it took so but but that's where I'm
going to land so my current my current
opinion is that we have enough evidence
now to say with some confidence that
2020 was
rigged and uh I I'm just going to
consider that a fact going
forward most of you are already there
right and by the way I wasn't here I
wasn't here until just this week I was
still open to the fact that if the
numbers had looked sort of similar to
the to
2020 I probably would have said all
right we watched everything we could
watch did everything we could do the
numbers were similar I guess that's what
the will of the people was but now we
know now we know that 2020 was was
unusual and it was unusual enough that
it's the only way you could explain the
brain dead guy got elected it's the only
way to explain it
really any did you know according to
Patrick ruffini on X that now the
Washington State's done counting I guess
that uh every single state all 50 states
uh plus DC swung
right every state including District of
Columbia moved for the right
everyone
everyone now how many of you remember in
2015 and 16 I was telling I was telling
the world that Trump is not just
persuasive but the most persuasive
person I'd ever seen and that he was
going to change more than
politics he was going to change reality
itself
was I
right did Trump change how you see
reality
itself I think the answer is
yes because what you think about the
fakeness of the news will forever be
different what you think about the
Integrity of our elections will probably
forever be
different what you think about what
works and what doesn't work in the real
world probably forever
different almost every assumption that
you had 10 years
ago just got
shakan yeah so I I did predict all of it
except the loss in 2020 although that
just made it a better threea
story well Sharon Stone has something to
say because you know what we need to
hear more from
celebrities so uh she has a theory about
Trump why Trump won quote it was
uneducated Americans who don't travel
abroad
so that's the problem they needed to be
listening to Sharon Stone a little bit
more what what is
happening the the fact that the
celebrities even make news for opinions
like that I mean there's just something
so broken about the
system oh my
goodness oh my goodness well Sharon
Stone here's what I've got to say about
Republicans there's at least one
Republican who's holding a really big
secret about
you and hasn't told the
world it's not me by the way there's a
there is a republican who knows a really
big thing about you and uh so far that
Republican has not told the
world
so you should trust publicans a little
bit
more anyway Katherine herriage says that
CBS was sort of slow walking her Hunter
Biden laptop stories there a lot of
details to it but every time she tried
to do something with the laptop story
there was some different form of push
back or hesitation or wait wait for it
so it does seem that CBS was a uh not
helpful news
organization well over in Lebanon
Lebanon and and Israel apparently
there's going to be a ceasefire if Asen
already started and I think there's
discussion about having a buffer zone
where the Lebanese military will be
between the borders of the Hezbollah
military people in Lebanon and Israel
we'll see if that works and of course
Hamas says hey hey we want one of those
too hey who's saying who is somebody
saying ceasefires we want a ceasefire
can we get one too
well of course the situations are
different because samas has uh captives
and uh no no ceasefire while you've got
captives if if you wanted to have a
ceasefire in which you would release all
the uh
prisoners that might be a conversation
but no you don't get a ceasefire because
Hezbollah got one that doesn't work that
way indeed now now Israel should be able
to move more of its military back to
hammer hos even harder so Hamas you're
going to have to come up with something
better than a ceasefire offer because
that's not going to
happen and uh the last thing I would
like to tell
you is that the reason that false
memories exist I saw I saw a story about
false memories and how they form the
reason we have false
memories so often is because the
simulation doesn't have enough compute
power to keep keep all of our stories
straight imagine if everybody's history
had to be consistent forever like every
conversation that you had with somebody
in a meeting you would have both of the
same memory of it
forever that would be a lot of
storage but I suppose instead we said
how about we'll do like the large
language models do and we'll we'll
hallucinate what could have happened
then based on sort of the way things
work in the real world that's what an l
does it doesn't know what happened but
it might hallucinate it knows based on
things usually go a certain
way so when you look at the number of
stories in history where there are
multiple
interpretations that has to be that way
because we're a simulation if we were
real there would be no
limit to how well you could remember
anything
um and everything everybody have the
same story
but the reason we don't have the same
story is that we can't live in the same
world it would be too complicated what
we can do is all have our own
hallucinations and dreams and then we
can imagine that our our version is the
real one and then we look at other
people and say hey you're so stupid your
memory is so
bad but probably that's the only way we
can stay in business is uh is to make
sure we don't need that much
memory so
do you live in a
simulation or not if you don't live in a
simulation how could it be that I'm
having so much control over your reality
how could that
be well here's what I think I'm going to
give you a little thing to try at home
you ready for
this this will only work for the players
not the NPCs if you're an NPC probably
won't even hear this it'll sound like
blah blah blah blah
blah try this
when you need something to go a certain
way and you don't know where it's going
to go say out loud when you're alone so
that other people don't think you're
weird say this author
mode author mode just say it out loud
author
mode and then tell it what you
want like an
affirmation and you might need to repeat
the affirmation number of
times but once you put yourself into
author mode it'll it'll go in pretty
quickly now I've been doing this
recently again it's sort of a
recreational belief right it doesn't
have to be true if it feels good I'm
going to do
it it really does feel like something's
happening now you could you could try
admid mode or uh Creator mode
personally I like
author because I imagine if we were
simulations and if there's like a real
character in the real world who is now
inhabiting me like an
avatar I would not have agreed to put my
Consciousness in an avatar unless I
could program it after the fact meaning
that I could juice it a little bit after
I got into it now maybe I would
forget or I would have to learn how to
do it well another part of my fun um
speculation is that you learn how
everything works right before you
die and that that's that's the point of
the game the point of the game is to
figure out how everything works and then
once you've done it the game is over so
then you get some kind of natural
illness and you just
die
so that's that's fun
um try it author
mode and then just tell it what you
want I've been doing it every day all
right um I'm not asking for an end to my
water problems because I think that's
programmed I think that's part of my
purpose all right but that's just
recreational belief uh I'm going to talk
to the uh locals people oh let me give
you a little update on tomorrow so
tomorrow is
Thanksgiving right
tomorrow is Thanksgiving right yeah it
is
um most of the people who do what I do
will be taking the day off what will I
be
doing same thing I always do so I'll be
here um bring the family I'll try to
curse less than usual I won't even I
won't even mention marijuana tomorrow in
case the family is
listening and uh if you want me to give
a shout out to anybody who's in the
family listening I'll be looking at the
comments tomorrow if grandma wants a
thrill just tell me to give her a shout
out so uh we'll be doing the same thing
tomorrow I'm pretty
sure pretty sure I can do a man cave
tomorrow
too so we'll do the regular Morning Show
then we'll do the man cave anyway I'm
going to say hi to the uh locals people
separately thanks for joining on X and
Rumble and YouTube it's great to see you
even though YouTube probably just
throttling me all
right
