it's good to see you what a
great day today is really it's great
um you're gonna have one of the most
enlightening coffees with scott adams of
all time maybe since yesterday and all
you need is a
government glass of tanker chelsea stein
canteen jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure that dope beast of
the day thing makes everything better
except election transparency
go
a little bit cold but still
amazing well i'll warm that up later
uh i misspelled the title
probably did i do my titles on these uh
live streams
by voice to text and sometimes i don't
check them that well
they could say anything i have no idea
what it says
all right here's uh some stuff in the
news
apparently an idea is going around that
when kamala harris
is sworn in as vp that there's a call
for her supporters to quote
wear pearls that's right so the idea is
that the
women who are supporting camel harris
will wear pearls that day in support
and i think that's a great idea i would
add to that chanel handbags would be
good
a good way to commemorate kamal harris's
inauguration would be expensive jewelry
maybe a 25 000 chanel handbag
um possibly a designer gown
i think that these are all totally
appropriate and i think that all 81
well probably 40 million women who voted
for harris biden they should get out and
get out
all their expensive jewelry their chanel
handbags their designer outfits
and show some respect wait
you you don't all have pearls ah
really there are people who don't have
chanel handbags and pearls and
designer clothes well maybe this plan is
stupid
okay maybe well moving on
so north korea is being provocative and
they had a
military parade and unveiled what they
think is the most powerful weapon in the
whole world
it would be a submarine-launched
ballistic
missile that's right north korea
has a submarine-launched
ballistic missile that's pretty scary
the only thing they don't have is uh
the submarine part apparently there's no
indication they have a submarine
they could launch any kind of a missile
but they totally plan to get one
but they have the missile i believe the
current plan is
if you get enough people lined up just
right you can kind of
throw it but until we have the actual
submarine
largely it'll be an elbonian slingshot
situation to launch it i don't know i'm
sure they have another plan
but it's interesting that kim jong-un is
testing biden
because this is one of the traps that
biden has as president
you know biden can't agree with anything
that trump did
it's just never going to happen right so
whatever trump did in north korea
biden has to do a different thing
because otherwise he would be
acknowledging trump did something right
what's the different thing starting a
fight with kim jong-un
what the hell is he going to do so biden
will either have to
fail because kim jong-un will probably
keep testing him
or turn into trump or
do something that didn't work for 60
years before trump
doesn't have a lot of options
here's uh uh this is this is i have to
admit
this story got to me a little bit
when you and i watched the uh the
capital assault and we saw the videos
and everything
i have to admit that you watch it a
little bit like it's a tv
show you know even though you know it's
real it's important
it's a big deal but there's something
about the medium of
you know television and broadcast that
gives you some distance
and so you kind of watch it like it's a
bad movie
you know it doesn't you're not really in
the scene so much
and then i heard uh aoc talking about uh
that and she was in there and she said
she thought she was going to die
in the capital assault now the first
thing i thought was oh you it wasn't
that dangerous you know
you're not going to die and then you
think
oh wait a minute if those protesters had
seen or gotten a hold of
aoc she would be like the
main target wouldn't she like if you
were
a deluded crazed
violent right winger is there anybody
who would be more sort of in your mind
as a
representative of the democrats that is
some scary
so when you hear aoc talk about it she
is
unique because she is so visible so she
would be more of a target than other
people
presumably that's really chilling
i have to admit it gave me a different
feel for the situation because
you know if if your ordinary politicians
had said we feared for our lives i think
that would have been true
but not the way she would fear for her
life because she would literally be a
target
for crazed right-wing people so
that was pretty chilling um it just in
my mind anyway it took it to another
level
of how horrible it was and basically
every day
every day we hear more about it and goes
to another level of horribleness
it's pretty horrible all right
um but also about aoc she
she was also noodling on the idea of
uh quote reigning in the media
with some kind of unspoken undesigned as
of yet
government oversight
involvement there's the idea is not
really formed
nor would she claim that it is but she's
simply making the
the observation that the media has
become dangerous
now of course when she talks about it
she's thinking right
leaning media but here again
is where my suggestion of agreeing with
the left
is the best strategy in agreeing with
them
aggressively in other words agreeing
with them harder than they agree with
themselves and here's a perfect example
if you say no aoc freedom of the press
and free speech and
we're just going to fight for that you
know probably nothing's going to happen
nothing good nothing bad probably just
nothing happens but suppose you
embraced it suppose you went the
opposite direction
that anybody would expect let's say
you're a you're a solid republican
and aoc says we've got to do something
about all this fake news basically
what if you said yes and said can i join
you
and put together something that fights
the fake news
because here's the thing i don't think
anybody understands
there's nobody on the right who wants to
be fooled by fake news from their own
side
nobody does that by choice i do think
that it's true that people on the left
are fooled by the media
people on the right are sometimes fooled
by the media too
and and how much of it is happening on
either side
probably depends on who's in office more
than
anything about the sides
so instead of fighting her on this
what sounds like government censorship i
would go at it aggressively and agree
with it and ask if he can help
because the first thing i would service
is the fine people hoax
the president said you should drink
bleach hoax
uh and i would just go down the line of
the hoaxes and then when
aoc and her side says yes but you've got
a bunch of hoaxes too
i would say yeah let's look into that
let's look into that
you make some good points here all the
hoaxes on your side
it would be kind of dumb to assume there
are no hoaxes on the other side
right and what are the odds that all the
hoaxes are on one side
nothing basically they're on both sides
and i think aoc is dead right on this
i i don't think that the there's an
obvious way to handle it
but let me make some suggestions
suppose there was i i feel as if there's
another
uh there's a an opening
for a need and i'm gonna i'm gonna model
it today
so i'm gonna model in a little bit the
need that i think the country needs
which is basically
interpreting the news for people who
aren't as good at it
now if you were young would you be good
at spotting
fake news well not as good as somebody
who's been around a while and seen what
the pattern looks like
all right so just right there an obvious
example young people
need a little bit of help knowing what's
real and what's fake in the news
also they need a little context they
might need a little extra description
so there's something that's needed on
top of news
that's not just opinion we have too much
of that
we've got plenty of opinion and the news
tends to just give you the headlines and
they
put it within their frame of whoever
their audience is so none of that's
useful
all right that the news is put in a
biased frame so that's not useful
and you know you don't have contacts so
it's not much very useful
what you need is somebody like what i'm
going to do when i talk about election
security in a little bit
you need somebody who can just explain
the situation
and is not beholden to either the left
or the right news sources
let me give you some examples now these
are not people i'd say
should do this function i'm just saying
that such people exist
there are people who exist who are able
to criticize the left and the right just
as easily
all right take a glenn greenwald
criticizes the left criticizes the right
has great context
he'd be a good one to be an explainer
matt tybee
no friend to president trump but also
doesn't seem to fall for
fake news too easily that's good
what about me you know i've you've seen
me agree with the president disagree
with the president
i'm left at bernie but i like trump
i i'm exactly the kind of person i don't
think i should be
the person but i'm the kind of person
who could give you a little bit more
than the news can give you and the
politicians can give you
jonathan turley there's a great example
jonathan turley is an excellent
source of somebody who reliably will
disagree with the
republicans when he's got a reason he'll
disagree with the democrats when he's
got a reason
and you can't tell which way he's going
to go he just follows the facts
take uh ellen dershowitz alan dushowitz
a famous democrat
will take a republican you know leaning
cause and heartbeat
if the law leads that way so you do have
a number of people who have a weird
quality
that they're at least capable of
switching sides depending on
where the facts go okay so maybe aoc has
something there
there may be let's say let me suggest
the
the mildest form
that you might call censorship but i
don't think so
all right let's say there was a group of
people
that have the qualities that i just
described
let's say that they form a private
independent entity who are independent
thinkers who just help you
sort through the fake news and let's say
that they
voluntarily limit their own involvement
in this entity to i'll just pick a
number
a two-year term so you don't want the
same people just being in there and
taking root and then they get too much
power and blah blah
so you want it to be a rotating fairly
quickly rotating group
and let's say that the government simply
did this
let's say the government said look i
know you don't trust the news on the
left
some of you don't trust the news on the
right we recommend
but do not require just recommend
that you check with this independent
group of rotating independent voices
just to give some context all right
we're not saying they're always right
we're not saying they're always wrong
but it's not going to be like the news
because the news isn't trying to be
right
if we're being honest the news isn't
trying to be right
i see uh mike cerdovich is being
recommended for this list
i would also put him on that list but he
has that
he has that uh pizzagate thing
over his head so i think even mike if
you talk to him privately i'm guessing
i'm not a mind reader
you know but just guessing
if you said hey do you think you're the
perfect fit for this
probably even he would say no i got that
pizzagate thing over me
try somebody else they'd have more
credibility i'm guessing that's what he
would say
but in terms of is he the type of person
who has
the right kind of mind and independent
thought yeah absolutely
so if it were up to me yes
but he's got a reputational issue um
that he would admit i think i mean he
put it in his own he put it in
his movie hoax so it's not like he's
running away from it
uh alex jones same problem right he's
he's he's not going to be viewed as an
independent voice
all right um but that's the idea
is that maybe there is some way to
embrace that idea
all right uh here's another way to know
that you live in a
propaganda bubble if everybody keeps
telling you that an election
recount is the same as an audit
because a recount feels like completely
different from an audit
how do you how do you check the software
of your
election um your election devices your
accounting machines and your voting
machines
how do you check that with a recount
and we're going to talk about that so do
they just count up the lines of code
and say well we counted the lines of
code it looks good to us
right i mean how do you check it so here
are some questions that i've been asking
and um i'll run them by you and i would
say that i'm short of having an answer
yet
now right now i'm going to be modeling
what i just talked about
somebody to describe the context of the
news
to give you a little better feel for
what's true and what isn't and here it
goes
how do you know how does anybody know
an election is fair it has been
suggested
that if you do these two things you can
pretty much find any kind of fraud
that would be big enough to change a
national election
right so this is brand new information
from just interacting with people who
are smarter than i am
for the last several minutes and this is
what i believe i've learned
number one if you do a recount you can
test
that the machines doing the counting
counted correctly
the balance but
as you're just about to yell into the
screen at me
but scott all you're doing is counting
the fake ballots if they're fake
right if the ballots were not real
ballots
counting them a second time would just
be recounting fake ballots
that's why you're going to say to me
right now right but
here's the second part suppose on top of
recounting
just to make sure that the physical
counting part
is done right suppose on top of that in
addition
you spot checked not every vote
but you spot checked enough to know that
there
there were no let's say signature
problems or
fake ballots or some irregularities with
addresses or eligibility to vote
so let's check let's say you didn't
check everyone
but you checked enough of them that if
there had been a problem you would you
would have picked it up
so now you've pac you've checked enough
of the ballots individually
to know that statistically you would
have found some problems if they were
there but you didn't
and then you've also checked the count
is there anything that you could do as a
potential fraudster that could defeat
those two kinds of checks
the the um the claim
is that there's nothing you could do
that wouldn't be obviously detectable so
everybody who says
a recount doesn't work you're absolutely
right
that by itself it doesn't work
everybody who says that if you just
check some ballots to make sure that
those signatures
matched and they're real people and it's
not dead people if you're just doing a
rant
let's say a random but statistically
valid check
that doesn't tell you that you counted
right but what if you do both
you've checked enough of the individual
ballots to know there's not a problem
with them
and you've checked the counting to know
the counting was right
have you now checked everything you'd
need to check
to find large fraud now this would not
uncover somebody who signed up their
their neighbor if we didn't know about
it right so the onesies and twosies of
course could slide right through
all right so somebody's saying what
about the software code
what would the software code do besides
make the count
incorrect and if you've got the final
tally
and you've got the original ballots and
you recount the original ballots
and then you look at the count that came
out of the machine
and they match you know within one or
two votes or whatever but they match
does it matter what happened in the
internals of the software
what could you do with the software that
would do anything wrong or bad
if you know that the ballots that went
into it and got counted
are the same as the final tally does
that not
prove to your satisfaction that even if
there was some mischief in there
it didn't do anything because if it did
they wouldn't match
am i wrong what about the dead voters
somebody says what about these alleged
zillions of dead voters in every case
it is my understanding that that has
been looked into
and found that those were onesies and
twosies in other words small numbers
and that there is no indication that
there are a large number of dead voters
that has not been detected
anywhere there are
lists of people who look like they might
have been dead or
incorrect who have maybe not checked
every single one
but since we know that lots of people
have the same name
there's another explanation which is
lots of people have the same name
now you go right down the list what
about the people who
um don't really uh
they use the same address or whatever
um everything
i believe most of these things have at
least been randomly spot checked
to know that they they're not checking
out
so let me get to point two
so here's the first thing that i want to
know uh and by the way an election
an election expert did contact me just
this morning and offered to answer some
questions about
election system integrity because the
question i have is
is there any way to cheat suppose
suppose it was true and i'm not i'm not
saying this is true
suppose it's true that our system
doesn't have any way you can cheat so
long as you've done those two things you
do a recount in the places that you have
questions
and you do a statistically valid check
of
any allegations about dead people voting
or wrong addresses or
signatures not matching and you don't
find any
is that it are you done 100 okay
i don't know i don't know but i do know
this
if that were true
if it were true that those two kinds of
checkings
get all the problems that could be found
why hasn't anybody told us that
does that seem like there's something
missing where is the expert who says
look look look the biggest question in
the country
is election integrity let me explain to
you
why it couldn't have been a problem and
then that expert hypothetically
would say as long as you're doing these
two things
recounting and checking it to the total
and also randomly checking
enough of them the claims of dead people
the claims of signatures not matching
if you check enough of them you can
determine statistically that there was
no problem
is my expert who actually understands
the whole system from beginning to end
who's who sits in front of the camera on
cnn and says
look you got all these claims but i'm
telling you there's no
physical possible way there could be
massive fraud
when you've checked these two things and
we have
where's that person is is the problem
that
what i just said is true but people are
terrible communicators
they don't know that that's the biggest
question and that it could be easily
described
because i just easily described it in
fact i only
got this description from a tweet from a
stranger
somebody just tweeted at me oh if you do
this and this you're fine
i don't know i'm no expert where's my
expert
i'll try to get you an expert now
i told you i got the master list of all
the election claims or
or something close to all of them and
the
debunks of them now it's a very long
document it's 42 pages of background and
claims and
what happened about them so i've looked
through them
and i was i was offered this document
by as i told you somebody somebody you
would recognize in the government
and i'm going to try to leave names out
of it just because i don't want to bias
bias the audience but
just assume that somebody somebody you
know in the government
said hey scott you're talking about this
you should see this document that shows
all of the claims
and then shows how they've been debunked
either by the courts
i think mostly by the courts or at least
logically debunked
so i looked through it what do you think
i found
do you think that i looked at a document
that claims to debunk all the claims
and that i read it and i said to myself
oh
pretty good these are pretty good
debunks
no of course not
if you live in the real world you should
have known before i even touched the
document
that what it wasn't going to do is
answer all my questions
right if you live in the real world
there wasn't any chance
that a 42-page document was going to
answer all of my questions
but it is really useful let me tell you
some of the things i found
so this is a document that its intention
was to make you stop doubting the
election
outcomes let me say here for the benefit
of my
uh censors who are watching this
i'm not personally aware of any proof of
election fraud just me personally i
i haven't seen any and if somebody told
me they'd seen it why would i believe
them
we're not in a world where you could
believe any allegation
i'm the guy who told you that at least
95 of all the
election fraud allegations at the very
beginning i told you this
would be bs even if there's some real
stuff there
95 percent of it would bs
so um which is not to say there's no
fraud
just that um the specific claims would
mostly be bps
so here are some of the things i found
as counters of course
a lot of the counters were that the
argument did not have standing
so a lot a lot of things were rejected
because it was too late to bring the
thing or the people bringing it we're
not the right people bringing it
so there were a number of things were
rejected for technical reasons
but the other question was were there
any actual
claims that were evaluated by a court
and the answer is yes ish
by evaluated by the court i mean that
the document debunking it
has reasons like this the guy making the
claim
is not credible to which i say
uh that would be true of every
politician
that would be true of a lot of people
who are not credible
but the claim is something you could
check
suppose somebody who's not credible
somebody who's passed
might have included being a ghost hunter
because that's one of the examples so
one of the experts
had some history of being a ghost hunter
and so that was used to dismiss his
claim
to which i say his claim had evidence
it wasn't like something he claims he
saw
is something he says he can show you
like on a document
on a you know he can show it to you
so everything that he saw he can just
hand it to you
and is willing to but it was dismissed
because he was once a ghost hunter
you feel okay about that do you feel
okay that his evidence
and and apparently he has at least some
expertise that would allow him to
evaluate that kind of evidence are you
okay that he was dismissed
for having once been a ghost hunter
because
if he's willing to show you the evidence
wouldn't it feel a little bit more
credible to say
and we looked at the evidence and here's
why the evidence is not real
i feel like that was a little bit
brushed off
now do i personally think that that's
you know whichever one was the ghost
hunter expert
do i personally think his evidence was
credible
no no i don't but i'm just saying if it
was rejected without being looked at
let's not claim it was being looked at
because that just
didn't happen or at least their response
in this document doesn't mention that
they looked at the details
but again 95 of the claims are going to
be bogus
and so i i don't believe that expert
because i don't believe any of them
just automatically i don't believe they
bet they've got a pretty big high
uh high barrier or let's say a high bar
for
proof in my mind and nobody's met it yet
so here's here's another allegation
there's an allegation that the vote
count stopped
in some places about this you know
was mysteriously stopped and then when
it
uh restarted there were there were
massive votes for biden
that's one of the major things that many
of the people
watching this would say is really strong
evidence that there's something
something up but you would be happy to
know that it has been
thoroughly debunked by this document i
saw
so what would be the other reason that
the vote counting would stop
and then when it restarts it's massively
biden votes
and the answer is that those are the the
mail-in ballots
so they saved the mail-in ballots to
count them at the end
and everybody knew that the in ballots
would favor the democrat because it
always does
so the answer to that is that the reason
that the voting
stopped and then when it restarted
it was massively biden is perfectly
explainable
by the fact that mail in boats we knew
would go to biden
are you good with that yeah
you're way ahead of me but why the stop
why the stop the debunk
for the claim that it was stopped and
then when it restarted
it was massively biden was that mail-in
votes
are at the end and they're massively
going to be democrat we already knew
that
but where did they explain the stopping
part
the stopping part was not addressed so
the document that debunks
the claim that there was mysterious
stops in the places where there are
questions
followed by the biden ballots that are
mail in mail-in
the mail-in ballot part that sounds okay
do you have any problem with
understanding that mail-in ballots
would favor biden but you probably don't
question that right
everybody knew that but why the stop
it was the stops that were common to the
problem areas
that are the question and the debunk
doesn't mention them
now could there be a perfectly good
reason and the answer is yes
the perfectly good reason could be and
i'm just speculating
pure speculation it could be that
there's some kind of a
process set up that's a little different
when you go to account the the male ends
that came from some source
you know there might be a reason where
they physically need to move them into
the building
say let's say for example uh and that it
takes a little while to physically move
them in so they weren't really stopping
counting maybe they were just
it was just the process but that needs
to be explained doesn't it
doesn't that need to be explained don't
don't we need to hear that
somebody say oh yeah it looks like it
stopped
but that's just part of the process you
should expect that
and then also explain to us why other
cities didn't have the stop
if that's the case it could be that
every city had some kind of a stop
some are longer than others maybe it
doesn't mean anything
but wouldn't you at least like to know
was it limited to these
problem at least alleged problem cities
they're the only ones that had to stop
with the restart
so if you think that the courts have
judged this and smart people have looked
at it
and they've addressed all the claims
i'm not seeing it all right here's
another one
suppose you go to a court and you say
i've got all this statistical evidence
that a crime happened
but there is a 10 chance
that it was perfectly legal whatever
happened
so my statistical evidence is a 90
chance that there was a crime i can't
tell
exactly 90 chance but there is a 10
chance that something normal happened
and it just looks
anomalous what does the court do with
that
toss it out they toss it out because if
there's
any explanation for the thing that
isn't crazy that's your benefit of a
doubt
right so let me give you an example
if you had an anomalous result in a
let's say a precinct where let's say it
always go on to trump for
or let's say it always go on to
republicans for
30 years in a row it went strongly to
trump last year
but this time it went to biden strong
now
if you're just a human you say whoa
there's there's something we need to
look into
oh this 30-year trend just went to trump
by the way i'm making this one up i
don't think this is an actual
allegation just went to trump uh
statistically
the odds of that 90 chance there's
something
fishy going on but there's a 10
chance that somebody was just good at
getting out the vote
right they could have just been really
good
in that precinct getting out the vote so
the court looks at it and said
it sounds like you have two explanations
one
90 chance that this is fishy and the
other
it was completely normal and somebody
was good at getting out the vote
what does the court do with that they
don't take the case
because if you know from the start
there is an explanation that can just
explain it
away you don't look at it so there are a
whole bunch of cases
in which there's something like a an
enormous
statistical question that the court just
looks at and says
but is there any other way this could be
explained
and if the answer is yes it's the core
doesn't look at it
because they're dealing with high
likelihood things
now suppose you had
lots of uh lots of individual cases that
if you looked at any one of them
it would not add up to changing the
election
but it's a bunch of different precincts
with you know
two percent shaving here there would
that be enough
to change the election well in theory it
could be enough to change the election
but if a court is just looking at one
part of it
the court is going to say this wouldn't
change the outcome the part i'm looking
at
so therefore i won't take it so there
are all these reasons why the court
is the wrong tool to even look into
stuff
because as soon as you say there well
there might be another explanation
the court says that's all we need to
hear if you can't
if you don't have a direct you know
witness to the crime
and it's just statistical and there's a
other reason
that it could have happened that's it
that's the end of the question
what about all those eyewitnesses that
you heard about
you heard about a whole bunch of
eyewitnesses that
had signed affidavits and stuff saying
they had witnessed crime
well turns out a lot of that's fake
there are a lot of people who say they
witnessed something
but a number of those allegations sound
like
we don't know what happened behind that
door or
i think they were changing things but i
can't be sure
or they had a pile of ballots that
looked suspicious but i don't know for
sure
if you add all of that up it doesn't add
to anything
nothing it's just people who saw
something that they didn't know what
they were seeing
and are calling out something looks
suspicious
but that's not evidence the fact that
somebody doesn't know why something
happened
isn't you know going to convict anybody
so the other problem is that
uh and the first time i heard this was
reading this document and i'll bet
you've never heard this
and ask yourself how well you're being
served by the news
that the next thing i tell you you've
probably never heard before
a lot of those witnesses signed
the statements but not under oath and
not with a
you know any kind of legal binding
anything and so the courts looked at and
said
yeah it's a signed statement not under
oath
and they toss it out so you can go to
the court and say
here are a hundred signed statements
from witnesses
who say that they directly saw some
fraud
what does the court do with a hundred
signed
statements from people who say they
directly
looked at fraud the court says that's
not evidence
because they're not signed or they're
not legally binding
there's nobody who signed under threat
or penalty of you know lying under oath
so the court says that's no evidence now
i have to ask myself
i have to ask myself why did these
so many people not want to sign
something that was legally binding on
them
well i don't know but if i were them
i would not sign something that was
libelous and legally binding on me
just to solve somebody else's problem i
think that from a legal perspective
i would not want to sign something that
that
bound me to what i said in a way that i
could be sued later
suppose i said i'm a direct witness to
some
some person or company let's say
dominion or something
doing something wrong and then i've
signed that under penalty
of you know uh of uh what is it
a penalty of lying under oath
i don't think i sign that because even
in my own mind i'm gonna think
maybe i'm not a hundred percent sure
people ask me what i saw
i saw an irregularity i'm reporting i'm
just doing what people asked
i witnessed i report it but if you're
asking me to do it under oath
then you're also putting me at risk
personal risk
maybe i don't want that maybe i'll sign
what i saw but i won't sign it under
oath
so what are the courts going to do
courts say that's not evidence
you didn't sign it under oath right
perjury is the word i'm looking for
thank you um
so we got that let's see and so the
number of claims that don't have any
direct evidence
claims that are not under oath you know
under
penalty of perjury uh no
no addressing the stopping of counting
just
addressing that there's a reason that
biden came from behind
um oh and then here's the one that just
made me laugh out loud you've also heard
the claims
that the number of rejected ballots
went from a larger number to an
infinitesimally
smaller number now when i say a larger
number i mean
you know we're only talking about one or
two percent or some small number
in the past historically had been
rejected
because the person who filled out the
ballot made some kind of an error
and it'd be some kind of an error that
you know might be hard to correct etc
now i think the process allows for
correction
if you didn't know that so even if a
ballot
has some problem and they can't count it
the way it is there is a process where
the voter is contacted
and they're given a chance to fix their
ballot i don't know how many people
actually do that
it seems to me they have a they have the
option to cure the ballot it's called
but i don't know how many people
actually
take the option and how many they can
actually
contact seems like it'd be a lot of
people but the claim
was that the because the standard for
rejection
went from an historical level to way way
lower
and almost nothing was rejected and that
difference in the rejection rate could
have actually tipped the election
you know because you know things were
close
actually i don't know that it could have
tipped the election but it would be a
bigish
kind of an impact
so here's the thing the explanation in
the document
was that there's another reason why that
difference could have happened and as
long as there's another
reasonable reason then you're not going
to get any kind of a
court action on it because the court
will just say
well you haven't disproven the other
explanation there could just be a
logical explanation for it
and here's the logical other explanation
people were more careful this time
that's it that's the explanation about
why the number
that were rejected for for being wrong
were so much lower this time it's a big
difference
because people were so much better
trained
at filling them out because they had
been taught by the news and by everybody
else
that you have to fill it down correctly
or else it won't count
so unlike every year in the past
where people tried hard to do it
correctly but they had a certain error
right
this time because i knew it was more
important and they'd been
trained a little bit they've been
trained a little bit better
they really got that error right down so
that's the other possible explanation
so as long as you have another possible
explanation
the court says well we're not going to
look into it
because as soon as the defense says
well it could just be natural that's the
end of the case
because you can't prove why it happened
you just have this suspicion
so that explanation is laughable
anybody who's met human beings knows
that they're not going to be
suddenly more accurate because you told
them to they're not going to suddenly be
more accurate because
orange man is extra bad people don't act
like that
the error rate that you've had every
year before is going to be pretty
similar
because people just don't we don't
respond that way
oh it's important okay i'll drop my
error rate to zero
you should have told me that the
election of the united states president
was important
i didn't know before so i guess i'll pay
attention now i mean just
ridiculous explanations
but maybe good enough for the court so
here's my point about this
anybody who tells you that the election
fraud has been looked into and debunked
by the right entities
speaking of the courts uh they're using
the wrong
tool for the job the court has a certain
role
but it is nothing like whatever it would
take
to determine whether fraud existed or
did not in an election
because the things that they can look at
are so limited
and the rules that they operate on are
so defined
that it just doesn't fit so the election
claims
just didn't fit in a court and the court
basically was saying uh stop trying to
bring them here
we're the wrong tool for that and they
are
but there is no other tool the court's
the only tool
but it's a completely wrong tool so if
you were trying to find out if there was
radioactivity
in your house and you decided to use
your smartphone to do it
let me do that now let me check for
radioactivity in my house
checking checking oh it turns out i
don't have an app for that
it turns out that my phone is the wrong
tool
to determine if there's radioactivity in
my house but i'm going to use it anyway
and when i don't find any radioactivity
i'll say there isn't any
because my tool didn't find any that is
exactly what's happening
not really not exactly but by analogy
using the court to figure out whether
the election was fraudulent is just the
wrong tool
the court can't do that it could do it
in some
special cases but it's really not
designed for that
and given the speed of things the
the allegations which are made to the
court were empty
and ridiculous and
crazy here's a
thing that makes me suspicious and
let me say again i'll bookend this by
saying i don't have any
i've never seen any proof that the
election was fraudulent
proof that i personally could look at
and you know see it with my own eyes and
that sort of thing
just lots of allegations but here's
what bothers me
if any kind of major fraud happened my
personal belief
is that it would more likely happen with
some kind of a software hack
if and this is a big if that could
happen without being detected in a
recount
because the recounts would have
presumably found it i guess i need an
expert to tell me if that's true
but let's say let's say to be big enough
to change the election it would have had
to be software
now i'm not saying that happened i'm
just saying it would have to be
something of scale
that could affect a lot of different
places in small ways so you could get
away with it
now if there was some entity
let's say russia or china or the
democrats or bad actors or whatever
some entity that had that capability
how would they cover their tracks when
the election was questioned
what would be the way to do that well if
they're the highest
level operators they would uh
they would take the place where the real
election fraud happened again
no evidence of this i'm just walking you
through a speculative scenario here
so i'm not making a claim of election
fraud i have no
i have no proof of that personally
but imagine a scenario in which you knew
that the
software hack was the thing that could
be detected
whereas all this other ballot counting
and mail and stuff
would be a great diversion the first
thing you do
is make sure that people got really
worked up about the
uh the the physical balance
and the mail-in stuff because you want
them to be looking in the wrong place
right just hypothetically i'm not making
an actual accusation
you'd want to so you would probably stir
up as much
fake news as you could on social media
show a bunch of fake
uh claims about physical ballots and
stuff to make everybody you focus on
that stuff
and even in the comments you can see
people saying but what about ballot
harvesting and
dead people and and those are all the
things you'd want them to be looking at
because once those are all debunked
because the people who again this is
just a hypothetical
if if the hypothetical group who had
hacked the election
wanted the deep the election skeptics to
be
uh to lose all their credibility they
would send them to look at things where
they're not
there's not going to be a problem and
then when the no problem is found
the people claiming problems are
debunked basically they look
they look like crazy now so that's what
you do first you get their attention on
the physical balance
but the other thing you do and this is
the important part
is you would drop a gigantic piece of
disinformation
about the software part and it would be
something like
oh hugo chavez and venezuela
own this machines and they're really
something like that
something so crazy that when you
debunked
the big lie that hugo chavez
that you would never be able to
penetrate beyond that
into forcing a recount because you would
have
discredited your own legal team so badly
that people wouldn't take you seriously
after that
and that's exactly what happened so
if you look at linwood and you know
cindy powell
if people who hypothetically
not claiming it happened don't have any
evidence for it i'm just walking through
a speculative scenario the way to
shut those people down would have been
to feed them
ridiculous conspiracy theories about a
military
psyop operation and venezuela and you
know maybe
maybe send some italian satellite
conspiracy stuff
and when that stuff is debunked it just
removes your ability to go deeper
because you've been so thoroughly
debunked so
i'm not saying that happened no direct
evidence of that whatsoever
i'm just saying it looks exactly like
what would have happened if the scenario
were to to happen
so you can't rule out either scenario
usually the fantastical ones are less
likely
but uh it just makes me scratch my head
when i see that it looks
exactly like a disinformation campaign
would look
doesn't mean there is one just means it
looks exactly like one
that's how it would play out
cnn is reporting on its own fake news
which is weird
uh so they say the evidence uncovered so
far
is that there was uh weapons and tactics
and plans for the
assault on the capital well ahead of the
president's
you know closest uh comments about it
and so that maybe it was just a planned
event as opposed to something that
spiraled out of
control because of anything trump might
have said
so cnn is actually basically debunking
their own news
interesting um
apparently the fbi according to fox news
visited some of the extremists
prior to the pro-trump rally
to try to talk them out of going so the
fbi
was so so concerned about violence in
the capital
that it was proactively visiting people
to ask them not to go
so given these two facts cnn saying it
looks like there was advanced planning
and fox news reporting that the fbi had
visited people ahead of time because
they knew there was advanced planning
and still the president is being
impeached
for being the thing that incited the
riot
that's right he incited the riot that
was planned
weeks before he incited them
and he actually got impeached for that
you live in that country
you feel proud about that are you proud
to live in the country that impeached
him
for something that was going to happen
no matter what he did
well i think he could have stopped it
and so i'm still
i'm not going to give the president a
pass on that because i think one tweet
would have stopped
the occupation of the capital the
evidence suggests
that if he had simply said uh you went
too far
get the hell out of the capitol building
they would have left immediately
i think this the evidence suggests that
they were sort of thinking that he was
behind him
waiting for a sign you know there's
actually reporting
that they were actively they had cell
phone problems
so they were trying to get somebody who
had a cell phone to see what trump was
saying
at the moment they were in the capitol
one tweet
get the hell out of the capital this is
not part of the deal
one tweet they walk out i think
somebody says he did but i don't think
that uh he was as timely as i'm saying
now we know that there were some at
least one bml activist and
maybe one democrat registered democrat
who were active parts of the capital
assault
so some some guy with a video crew
who was uh his own video shows him
actively
encouraging the protesters and actively
being part of it
and yelling stuff like it's our house
and we get to
we got to get this the burned down
that's the guy who claims he was just
taking video of it and he's not guilty
so we do know that at least on some
scale
that there were non-republicans there
for making purposes so that's confirmed
now
when i say it's confirmed i mean that
cnn will never say that this has
happened
but i don't know at one scale with there
are some people who are confirmed to be
on the other team so it so it's at least
a
partial false flag
it's definitely not a full false flag
because lots of people were just trump
supporters
but it's at least a partial fake flag
false flag and i don't know if that's
even a thing
because if it's partial it's not doesn't
make much difference all right
um have you seen the video of uh
the leftist destroying washington d.c
during trump's inauguration
how quickly for we forget that trump's
inauguration
incited a riot but not because of trump
necessarily but because of the democrats
don't you think that that riot was sort
of
sort of incited by the democrats what
they've been saying about trump during
the entire election
i'd say so so we just act like it didn't
happen
but there's video of a riot and windows
being broken
during trump's uh inauguration
still stories about san francisco
shrinking
rents are going down home prices going
down in san francisco every
the tech company is moving out here's a
interesting factoid i live an hour from
san francisco
and home prices here went up
because part of moving out of san
francisco is also moving
an hour away still being in california
but not being in san francisco
so my property values actually went up
weirdly
because san francisco went to hell
so biden's recommending 1.9 trillion in
covid relief
and blah blah blah and an incoming
administration officials said that
the vaccine rollout was quote worse than
we could have imagined
and i you know i don't have a fact check
on whether the
vaccine rollout is worse than we
imagined or not
the thing i would have assumed would
happen
is if you do something on a very large
scale for the first time
ever and i would say that describes this
situation
what should you expect well you should
expect that the first month
is a total of failure followed by the
second month improving
and then maybe by the third month you're
better than you could have ever imagined
it could have been
because that's just the learning curve
so judging the
rollout of the vaccine on the first
month
is fair because we didn't want to get
that right
but i don't think it's unexpected that
it was terrible for the first month
i feel like that was sort of baked into
the process because the reason you test
things
is that you don't roll out a major thing
and then the first month is terrible
take obamacare obamacare roll down
all kinds of problems with the servers
and the website and everything but you
know eventually
eventually it got to the point where
it's so sticky
it's not going away apparently
so perfectly normal but still
i think trump administration has to take
the blame for that and certainly his
distraction about the election
and impeachment and all that stuff that
stuff matters
i think we're paying for it um
biden knows that his inauguration will
attract violence
wouldn't you say wouldn't you say that
biden knows for sure
that the odds of violence at his
inauguration
are close to 100 percent
why does he have it why is he going to
have the inauguration
if he knows there's going to be violence
would he not have blood on his hands
because the inauguration doesn't have a
constitutional purpose apparently
i mean you could do i think you don't
need the inauguration
but if you do need it it doesn't have to
be in front of a crowd
so it's a completely unnecessary
ceremony
guaranteed to hurt or kill americans
and he's going to do it
shouldn't he be impeached during the
inauguration
i would think that congress should
initiate impeachment during the
inauguration
because he's doing something that
absolutely isn't going to invite
or incite it's going to invite violence
and doesn't have a purpose
there's no purpose
so i would say should be impeached
during his inauguration
that's not going to happen so don lemon
continues to be the worst
human being in the history of human
beings and he's gone full
full nazi accusation to all trump
supporters
so his his thinking if you can call it
that
is that because the clan supports
trump he says therefore if you also
support trump you're supporting the clan
good thinking don lemon there's an idea
that will destroy the whole country
now don lemon of course is an accused
sex offender i don't know the truth of
it but he's accused of
molesting some young man
and i would guess that uh given that
there
are plenty of pedophiles in the world
wouldn't you assume that a lot of them
watch
don lemon show would you say it's a true
statement
that lots of pedophiles watch the news
probably i mean they watch everything
else so why wouldn't they
so does that make don lemon by his own
preferred way of looking at the world
does that make him a pedophile because
he's supported by them
now he's not claiming that every single
racist
supports trump he's saying that
members of the klan do lots of racist
support trump
i think that's true but he's not saying
that there aren't also racists
who support other people likewise i'm
not making any claim that pedophiles
only like don lemon that would be crazy
but a lot of them do wouldn't you say
that would be true
so i feel as though his own logic
puts him in the pedophile camp and i'm
not saying he is
i have no certainly i'm not going to
accuse him of anything like that
i'm just saying that by his own
preferred way of looking at the world
he's associated with pedophiles and i
guess he's happy with that
that's his it's his own philosophy so
here's something scary the the guy who
brought the zip ties or he claims he
found them and he was going to give them
to
authorities the the zip tie guy at the
capitol assault he was photographed with
some zip ties
the type you would use to constrain
somebody like
cheap handcuffs so here they found him
and then they removed his firearms
and so i guess he's under home
confinement without his
firearms but here's the scary part
and his internet access will be limited
what his internet access will be limited
to what and when did that become a law
do you remember a law about your
internet access being limited
because that's too far that's too far
let me say that again um you know you
i know some of you are going to argue he
shouldn't have his firearms removed if
you're absolutist
in that but at least there's an argument
for that
you know if somebody has been accused of
some violent crime might go to jail for
it
has has weapons might have been involved
in an insurrection
you don't know you could you could see
the argument for taking away their
firearms
temporarily until the legal system you
know does its thing
and you could argue against it i think
you could make an argument against it as
well
but what is the argument for taking for
limiting his internet access
really
limiting his internet access feels
completely wrong to me
now i suppose they're doing it so he
doesn't i don't know
talk to other bad people and raise
trouble but isn't that sort of a just a
free speech sort of
situation and he hasn't been he hasn't
been convicted of anything
to me this is super alarming that the
government can use your internet access
as a penalty without the benefit of any
law
that suggests they can maybe there is a
law i just don't know about it
so i'm just going to put that out there
as a gigantic red flag that's about the
scariest thing i've seen this week
and that includes kim jong-un's you know
intercontinental
missile all right um
that is probably all i wanted to talk
about i think
i think it did
somebody says you told us we'd no longer
have free speech well we don't
we don't have free speech in a practical
sense
we have it in a legal sense
most of the time apparently this
this person can say anything he wants
just not on the internet
all right so having now modeled for you
um the example of somebody who's
not taking a left or right side i hope i
hope that you saw that
when i talked about the election did it
feel like i was
biased right or biased left
everybody's biased so i'm not going to
claim that you know i'm free from bias
that's not a thing
but i think i got close i think that
when i talked about the
election claims as well as the debunks
i feel like i treated that fairly
now wouldn't you like to see more people
do that kind of thing
and i think aoc is on to something
without having designed the particulars
of it
there is a need for this would you not
agree that there's need for this
whether you like the way i did it or not
that's separate
but there's a need for this just an
explainer
somebody to explain what is likely and
what is not
etc all right so i'll put that out there
oh
somebody wanted me to mention the jack
dorsey video
so in so there's a i guess project
veritas has a video of jack dorsey
talking to 5000 twitter employees
in which he's saying that you know they
were focusing on
trump's twitter account and what to do
with that but also
they were getting rid of q anon and that
there would be you know
lots more of this later and that it's
the beginning of a process not the end
etc
now that was held up by people as
evidence that jack dorsey is saying he's
going after
conservatives i guess that's the way it
was interpreted
but twitter's response to it was kind of
perfect
again if you're just judging the quality
of the communication
i'm not talking about the issue just the
quality of the communication
twitter officially said uh yeah he said
on that
hidden video exactly what he said in a
tweet thread yesterday
and he did basically basically what he
said on the undercover video
is exactly what he said in public i
didn't see any difference
now the thing we'd be looking for that
jack has not mentioned
and it's really glaring in not being
mentioned and it's a big problem
in both the veritas video and his tweet
what he didn't mention is that anybody
on the left would ever be
censored if you want to use that word in
the same way
now how would you feel if you heard that
in addition to cue anon that accounts
associated with the left
but with different you know rumors or
disinformation
or violent ideas suppose they had also
been taken down
how would you feel about that well you'd
feel different
you'd feel different but when you know
jack dorsey is talking to twitter and
the only
words that at least are on this video
have to do with
folks on the right it is totally
legitimate
that the folks on the right say i think
i need a little more context
and if i don't have it i'm going to
assume that this is all about just going
off to the right
would that be a fair assumption based on
everything you've seen
would it be fair for you to assume that
twitter and jack are only going after
accounts on the right
i would say yes i would say yes that
would be a fair assumption
based on the evidence we have so if
that's not true
i would ask jack and twitter to clarify
because that would be an important
clarification so if there are examples
of
groups on the left maybe some antifa
accounts etc
that are being blocked for the same
standard that they
promote disinformation and or violence
um disinformation being of election
kind i think is the specific kind that
they care about
so wouldn't you say it's a
fair request to at least get twitter
and jack dorsey's opinion about whether
this is going to be
really a right leaning effort or a
violence-leaning effort in terms of
service effort
i'd like to hear that just as a
clarification but
i don't think we heard a new information
on the veritas
project veritas video sounded just like
the tweet
but both of them have that missing
element that we'd like to see
all right
somebody said trump was an idiot for not
denouncing the proud boys at that debate
well trump has a uh he has a pattern
of not denouncing anybody who's on his
side
and you could argue that that helped him
get elected the first time
so strategically it's hard to know if
that's a plus or a minus
all right i see some questions about dr
shiva and his software discussion and i
would get back to my
original question which i'm still
waiting for an answer is
uh could you do anything to the software
that would cheat the election and not be
caught in a recount plus an audit
an audit of the signatures and stuff
like that
um so we don't know all right that's all
we have for now and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
all right youtubers um
let's see there were bad people on both
sides
yeah uh just print more ballots
packetized crime yeah the idea of
packetized
election fraud would be that there's
lots of it but if you find any
bit of it it's not enough to change the
election so
the way you would do that most reliably
would be with software
but if anything like that could be
detected with a recount
well it wasn't um
all right uh barnes says powell was set
up
yeah that's the information that i'm
getting as well early on
i heard that from people who know this
world early on people said oh that's
obvious
disinformation campaign
all right that's all i got for now i
will talk to you
tomorrow
