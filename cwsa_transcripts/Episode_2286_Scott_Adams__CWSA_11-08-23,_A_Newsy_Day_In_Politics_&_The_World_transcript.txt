[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization the best thing that ever
happened to you it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and boy are you glad you're
here and it just gets better if you want
to take it up a level it's hard to
believe there's another level above this
but there is all you need is a cup or a
mug or a glass a tanker jelly time a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go not to be confused with the
simultaneous rip that only happens in
the man gave for local subscribers
don't tell the kids adults
only well here's here's the best news
it's a very newsy day so I got lots to
cover but let me start with the good
news Health Care in America has been
solved you remember when that was a big
deal and everybody was like Health Care
Health Care My Health Care is bad well
when was the last time anybody
complained about healthc care am I right
yeah I haven't seen anybody complain and
I don't remember the last time so we
have to conclude that healthc care has
either been solved or it was never a
problem in the first
place I don't know which one it is was
it solved or was it never a problem in
the first place or is there some reason
that we never talk about
it what could that be I don't know but
if you were wondering hey I wonder
wonder if anything in the news is real
you know what else wasn't real all the
 about healthc care that we put
up with for about 5 years none of it was
real because either we easily solved it
I don't know maybe we did I'm not even
saying we didn't or it was never an
issue and the whole thing was
from the
start I honestly don't know like I
literally honestly I don't know what's
going on
do any of you
know did something happen that I'm not
aware
of because the only thing I know of is
that millions and more people came
across the border putting an extra
burden on healthc
care
so in theory the news should say that
the health care situation is getting
worse would wouldn't that be the normal
thing you'd
hear what's going on could it be that
all of our news is fake and always has
been huh just something to think about
well let's look at this other news and
see what's going on did you know there's
a new way for celebrities to look 10
years
younger so uh many of you are planning
to someday be celebrities so this will
be important to you the rest of you no
importance at all but if you plan to be
a celebrity who looks 10 years younger
apparently you can rub some stem cells
on your micro needling
holes do any of those words mean
anything to you micro needling how how
many of you don't know what micro
needling is I mean the word kind of says
it but have you ever heard of it so um
it's a thing that usually women do to
improve their skin so you get this
little roller I think it's a roller with
lots of little needles in it and you
roll it over the skin and it literally
put little micro needle holes in your
skin now the idea is you you know rub
good things under your face into those
holes and it sort of feeds the skin in
your face and makes it better but one of
the things you can put in those micro
needling holes is stem cells and
apparently it's something they've been
doing for a long time it's pricey so you
got to be a
celebrity so you'd have to repeat it
every 18 months and it cost several
thousand each time you repeated it but
it takes 10 years off your life or not
off your life off your perceived
age not 10 years off your life that
would be a different story entirely all
right now you know that's out there so
it gives you another reason to become a
celebrity if you didn't have enough
reasons here it is you look 10 years
younger well apparently there was an
election
yesterday and uh I wasn't terribly
interested in it because
didn't seem to affect me directly too
much but um there are some fairly
surprising
results and a little bit predictable or
maybe we just think that because we'
like to think you know we would have
known but here's uh what it looks like
uh it sucks to be
Republican that's the bottom line so
apparently the Republicans um are very
Resolute in uh their strategy of losing
on
principle so it seems that the Democrats
have a strategy of winning at all
costs and they're going against the
Republicans whose strategy is to lose on
principle now if you were going to
predict the outcome one group they're
roughly you know similar sized meaning
that on any election could go either way
now you have to do a prediction one side
will do anything to
win one side would rather lose on
principle than
win which side
won guess what the people who would try
to win at any cost did pretty
well uh Mike cerovich is sort of calling
at the Republicans for a strategy of uh
intentionally losing on
principle because abortion is the big
question and for Republicans uh that's
sort of a non-negotiable issue
and it's non-negotiable on
principle so they'd rather lose an
election because abortion is pretty
popular in a lot of
places um well and somebody says as it
should be right so I'm not sure you're
not getting what you
want because you know given the
tradeoffs Republicans appear to be
intentionally picking losing uh on
everything else in order to win on you
know the the moral
part that's the problem with having a
moral philosophy you know there's no
point in having it if you're going to B
it right what's the point of having that
belief if you're going to say you know
I'm really I'm really against this
murder of babies as as one side would
say but if I can get my taxes lowered
I'll murder some
babies right so the Republicans are sort
of put themselves they painted
themselves in a corner and they don't
know how to get out there might be
exactly one politician who's figured out
how to get out of that trap and he
wasn't
running right Trump is the only one who
figured out a way maybe and that's just
a maybe probably won't even work but at
least he knows how to talk about it
right he talks about making both sides
happy he talks about negotiating
something let letting the states decide
it so his focus is not on Save the baby
or kill the baby everybody who does that
is is probably in the wrong argument his
argument is how do you get the country
to a place where we can live with each
other that's exactly right it's exactly
right how do you get to a place where
you can live with each other that is the
presidential
framing there there's one thing I'd like
him to tweak that would make it uh A+
plus it goes like this you don't want
your president to decide if you kill
your
baby or some version of that you don't
want how about this you don't want your
president to make uh to be involved in
the decision that is this
personal you never want your president
to be well here's a better way to say it
you never want your president to be
ambiguous about life life or death for
an American that is to say given that
there's a disagreement about when Life
Starts the appropriate place for any
president to be is pro lifee but also
take themselves out of the decision you
want the decision to be closer to the
people who have to make it the women in
this case but you want the head of the
state to say I'm pro-life but I but I
accept you know I accept the I'm ruling
or leading a country that might have a
different opinion that there is a way to
have an opinion that's absolutely
opposite of the public and sell it to
the public you just say this is my
opinion the leader should have this
opinion and then the states are going to
have to work it
out I you can sell that all day long I
think because you don't ever want a
president who says you know what there
are some situations where I would kill
an American
that's just got to be off the
table like completely off the
table Trump could sell
that so I don't think there was anybody
who sells as good as him who is running
which is part of the story uh if Trump
had been there maybe there would have
been a much bigger turnout I'm sure
there would have been so some of the
things would have been reverse just
based on
turnout but the the lesson that seems to
be is that if you don't talk about uh
abortion
correctly you're you're at a big
disadvantage if you're a
republican so an example would be Ohio
uh covich points this out Ohio is a
state that Trump won
bigly but that it uh it went for
legalizing
abortion so if they like Trump and they
still said they like abortion you better
learned how to talk about
it
okay
um let's see naturally if there was an
election in the United States what what
things can you predict oh let me think
uh is it possible that the losing team
would claim that there were election
irregularities well
yes now I'm seeing these primary
on social media I'm not sure how the
mainstream media is treating it I don't
know what kind of seriousness they're
putting into it but there's report of
some voting machines in Pennsylvania
that malfunctioned or quote switched
votes I do not have an opinion of
whether that's true it's just part of
the part of the story and other people
say how could it be that um a whole
bunch of Republicans would win in the
state but then you uniquely and
differently the governor could win as a
Democrat like how does that make sense
that all these people are winning in the
lower levels of the election but the
governor the governor goes the opposite
way how is that
possible abortion do I have to answer
that question for
you the the governor is more important
to abortion that might be the whole
story right so it makes sense to me that
the Democrats wouldn't even know the
Lesser candidates maybe they're less
interested but they're really interested
in abortion so they make sure they get
the right Governor at
least so that probably you know that so
abortion seems to be the answer to
almost all the Mysteries except you know
if there were some machines that
malfunctioned but if there's a major
election it's impossible for me to
imagine um all voting machines working
doesn't that seem like a stretch when
when you hear that there was some place
that had problems with voting
machines is your first thought ah
there's evidence of fraud because my
first thought is how could you possibly
have hundreds of thousands of
machines and and no
errors in what world has that ever been
possible so the the thing you should
expect is that there would be errors
that the machines would have some
malfunctions that doesn't that doesn't
prove anything about any potential
fraud because with or without fraud
you're going to have machines going down
and then people are going to assume it's
fraud now was there fraud separate from
the question of did some machines
malfunction of course I did you're
always going to have some
malfunctions was there fraud I I'll give
you my answer which will be my standard
answer
always uh I'm not aware of any specific
evidence of
fraud same as I said for the 2020
election I'm not aware of any however we
live in a country in which all of our
other institutions are corrupt somewhat
obviously so so why would this be the
exception just the fact we haven't seen
it is
fascinating but I would also point out
that um there's more than one way to rig
an election one way would be you know
gaming the rules you making sure that
the laws are a little better for your
team than the other team another way is
to rig the media with fake stories and
coverage that leans One Way Etc so I
think it's simplistic and almost
ridiculous to say that the number of
votes you count is the only part of the
process because the way you vote is
based on what you saw in the news
primarily I mean for the few people who
might change change parties at all it's
based on the news and the news is
fully fully biased and corrupt so it's
always a rigged system because the news
is
rigged would you
agree that you we don't have a system
that even has the potential to just do
some kind of you know objective people
vote situation yeah our our opinions are
literally assigned to us by the news as
I like to say when was the last time you
saw somebody who had an opinion that
wasn't exactly what their news told
them nobody it's almost never it's the
rarest thing yeah your opinions just
resigned by the
news I guess there's a GOP uh debate
tonight
some say it will be uh Nikki hilly
versus dentus as the you know two people
were leading behind
Trump um but here's my take on Nikki
Elli let me read you two quotes one from
Hillary Clinton and then one from Nikki
Haley the first quote is when I decided
that at all costs and risk to myself I
would try to make sure that Hillary
Clinton did not get elected in 2016 and
it was based on this
quote she said quote I just think women
in general are better listeners are more
collegial more open to new ideas and how
to make things work in a way that looks
for win-win outcomes so that was in the
context of saying why a woman would be a
better leader than a
man and I heard that and they said
seriously you can say that right out
loud that a woman is better than a man
for a
job can I say that could I say that out
loud if it were the other way around
nope this is pure sexual discrimination
and this is the part this is the moment
when I went nuclear uh and said at at
all costs to myself this person cannot
be the president of the United States
you you can't actually run on a platform
of
discrimination to say that one part of
the country is is less good than the
other part and then she goes with her
deplorables I'm like what the hell what
the hell is going on how do you run for
president by insulting first half of the
country the men and then another slice
you know the the deplorables like who's
left so yeah she deserved to lose more
than anybody has ever deserved to lose
an election but what did Nikki Haley
say quote if you want something said ask
a man if you want something done ask a
woman you that was the quote that
made me want Nikki hilly to lose at all
costs in fact so much so that if she
becomes the nominee I'm going to support
the other side let me let me tell you
that just so you're not surprised if
Nikki Hy somehow became the nominee I'm
going to support the Democrat whoever it
is I just want you to hear
that don't hate me for it I will not I
will not support somebody who says
basically men suck that's not going to
happen not in any world is that
going to happen that I would support
that so just just know I'm leaving you
completely if she's the nominee
completely all right it's not because
she's a woman can can I say that it's
not because she's a woman it's
because she's a woman who says that men
are that's it that's good
enough so Nikki Hy and Hillary Clinton
are two and should never be in
the presidential office um Laura lomer
has a really good Scoop I tell you the
the independent journalist types you
know the Steven Crowder got that
Nashville scoop good for him I'll say
congratulations again on that
and now Laura lommer has this scoop so
she's found tweets from Judge Arthur
engeron uh
wife so she's on the xplatform so angron
is the Jud judge for Trump's trial in
which he's accused of various uh
property
inflations and the the wife of that
judge is literally doing a Trump
memes
his wife is doing Trump memes in
public in public on the
xplatform now in what world do you
continue the
trial in what world do you continue the
trial assuming this is true and I think
Laura lummer has the right information
seriously in what world do you do that
they need to shut down the trial
immediately or else I will never think
this country is credible again I mean I
already don't but I mean my my opinion
of the justice system will go to
completely broken if there's even one
more day of this trial you cannot have a
judge who can only have one outcome or
else he can't go
home how much more obvious is this he
can't go home to his
wife if he doesn't convict Trump that's
what it is because there's no way he's
going to go home to that no no human
husband is free of that bias it's just
not a thing in our world it doesn't
exist that he could do his job
independently if he has to go home to
that nobody could I couldn't you
couldn't there's no amount of training
there's no amount of you know legal eth
iCal behavior that has any bearing on
this this is two human beings in a
situation where the most predictable
outcome is certain to
happen so congratulations Laura lumer I
think you ended this trial and if you
didn't there's just no way this can be
credible now I don't know that is there
any appeal process that could be based
on
bias is that a thing
could could a higher Court throw it out
just based on this just based on the
wife's Behavior I've never heard of
it but to me that would be the the
simplest most obvious clearcut cause and
effect decision that was ever made there
would be no doubt about
it turly said yes well I'll take
Jonathan turley's view on that looks
like a
yes but this is potentially really
really sort of a big deal so good job
Laura
lomer
um rasmuson poll on what people think
about a ceasefire in the Middle East so
this was uh how many people agreed with
Netanyahu that ceasefire would be a
surrender basically 68% of us likely
voters agreed so 2third of us voters say
that Natan who's basically has to keep
pressing the fight no
ceasefire um how many well yeah a lot of
people
disagree just 21% disagree
H I'm not sure I would have ever guessed
that the people disagreeing were in the
range of
21%
um here's what I
see uh let let me tell you how the
uh Israel Hamas situation is shaking out
for me you know how as time goes by you
have a you have an initial opinion but
then it could morph into a little bit of
a different framework over time as as
things develop well my initial decision
was of course very similar to most of
you which is the attack on Israel was so
horrific you know some kind of a Revenge
self-defense thing thing was inevitable
and it wouldn't matter if you liked it
or not you our opinions just have
nothing to do with anything they're just
going to do what they're going to do we
would do the same every country would do
the same it's you know just cause and
effect so at first it's just like well
this is this is what happens if you do
that this is going to happen but I've
come to see it you know when you start
looking at all the context and people
talk about the history of it and
everything I've started to see it as two
drunks having a fight
that's what it looks to me it looks like
two drunks having a fight and if you
take it if you remove the fact that
they're drunk it wouldn't make
sense right now the drunk part is not
inebriated in my example the drunk part
is what's happening in their
minds my take is that Israel uh has a
I'm going to say a mental defect from
the
Holocaust and one that makes sense
one that you would have as well right if
you were Jewish and you were alive today
and especially if you had any relatives
who had any brushing attachment or
association with the Holocaust how in
the world could you be completely
mentally
balanced you know because things that
you would worry about would be
completely different than things that
other people would worry about imagine
worrying that any
moment
somebody could try to exterminate people
who look like you like at any moment it
could just pop up like it did in Germany
what would that do to you mentally yeah
you'd have this permanent
PTSD so so Israel while I completely
support their their reactions to the war
and they're pressing the attack on Hamas
completely support it it's also true
that they're coming from a place of just
mental
disorder earned earned and that doesn't
mean that they're doing illogical things
but you know drunks get it right too now
here this that's not an insult I'm
saying anybody who went through a let's
say a cultural trauma of that size is
going to have some Legacy effect
similarly I would say the same thing
about Black Americans you know even
though it's been even a longer period
since slavery how in the world does that
not affect you today
right there's take uh Native
Americans will Native Americans ever be
right after you know their entire world
is upset and stolen from them I don't
know how you could be how how could you
possibly be brought into that world and
have a you know a comfortable
normal uh nonparanoid view of the world
it wouldn't be normal if you did it
seems like you know you'd have to to be
affected by that
now what about the Palestinians now I'm
not going to get an argument argument
about what's true and what's not true I
will simply say that their perspective
is that they also suffered a
holocaust that that was a different
nature but that in their view they were
displaced from the land with a variety
of cruel actions which were calculated
to depopulate them so Israel could have
a proper country now that's their view
of
things not my not my necessarily my view
just that's their view so you've got two
groups that are
completely
mental because of their
past
and you would expect that both of them
are acting somewhat naturally under the
situation that they've been raised in so
you could completely
see how they could never make peace
because they're both battling their past
and not each
other does that make sense you can't
make peace in the real world when
neither of them are really fighting in
the real world they're fighting in their
minds do you get that this war is in
their ma their minds Israel is trying to
solve their their mental discomfort with
the risk of living next to this
risk this
you know in my opinion would be
unlivable there there's no way I would
be okay with living next to that risk
after October 7th so that's completely
understandable but it's a mental illness
at the same time completely
understandable and what they're doing
about it is what anybody would do about
it but the Palestinians and P I saw
article by Joel Pollock he was calling
out the New York Times article in which
the leaders of Hamas are saying fairly
directly that they didn't care about the
Palestinian Palestinian well-being and
were intentionally trying to make
everything much much worse as part of
their
strategy now who who would like destroy
their current world because they just
feel they need to get back that Israeli
land that was stolen and they were
displaced would be their version of it
and they got to get rid of them
basically they're living in the past as
well you know why is it that Saudi
Arabia could get friendly with Israel
eventually well they don't have that
past right they're actually dealing in
the present so Saudi Arabia says well if
I make a deal with you we can both make
more money and have more peace so why
wouldn't I you know just cuz these other
countries don't like you why wouldn't I
so Saudi Arabia doesn't they're not
fighting the path
if you think that Israel and Hamas can
make peace you're missing the fact that
they're not fighting in the real world
in the real world all the people are
dying but that's not where the fight is
the fight is in their minds and you
can't you can't you can't solve a mental
problem in the real
world what do you
think I'm just presenting that frame as
a better way to explain why if you think
they can negotiate
this you can't negotiate the
past the past is
non-negotiable it
happened like or or their version of it
happened right let's say their version
of it happened you cannot negotiate the
past there's nothing you can do in the
present that fixes that
nothing and and it's not because
anybody's dumb it's because they're
traumatized in a way that would make you
act exactly the same
way if I put you if I took you know a
healthy healthy you and just said all
right we're going to make you a child
and we're going to put you in one of
these two environments you would act
exactly the
same why because of the
past because of the past
so um well we'll see who wins but
you know it turns out that whoever has
the power holds the country that's kind
of the whole story so I think Israel
will hold
it all right uh you know the story about
the there was some legislation that was
part of a bigger bill that included a uh
2026 uh regulation that would say
American cars have to be built with a
kill
switch and I said to myself why have I
never heard of that why is Thomas Massie
the only one talking about it and then
some people say that's not even in the
bill there's no kill switch in there and
then Thomas Massie shows them the
language in the bill here it is read it
for yourself now the way the bill is
written and I didn't know this until
today is it's in the context of stopping
drunk
drivers so when you see it you know by
itself you say whoa there's a way to
turn off the car so a drunk driver can't
start the
car
maybe like you know it seems like an
insane you know intrusion into freedom
but you also say well you know we do
make I mean it's not unprecedented to
make an insane intrusion into your
private life because it saves a bunch of
lives and you know our system allows
that so you could easily imagine why
people would look at it and go well come
on that's a good idea you know maybe
someday we can make that work now
imagine if you were to add AI to your
car and then also the kill switch and
that you had to negotiate Ai and
convince it that you were sober or your
car wouldn't
start now that I could almost live with
because you might actually choose to buy
that car CU you know that you might
drink and drive but you don't want to
but you know if you have a few drinks
your judgment is good you're going to do
it anyway so suppose you buy a car your
own
choice it's got AI plus a kill switch
and it actually asks you you know how
many drinks you had and and it just
judges your reaction maybe it looks at
your eyes right you could read your face
it might read the stability of of your
body it might give you a little test it
might say you know do this with your
hands while it watches you know see if
you could reproduce something might ask
you a little memory test might might
check your voice against your normal
voice to see if you've got some slurring
right it might say um I've decided that
this wouldn't be in your best interest
and would you like me to call you an
Uber well now that you mention it that
wouldn't be a bad idea why don't you
call me over
now
um it would save your life and other
people you could imagine now but as soon
as you make that
mandatory well now you're in a whole
another world that's then you're going
to have a lot of reflexive disagreement
and I think I'd be one of them so um but
it passed uh I think the argument was
don't worry Thomas Massie this is just
for drunk drivers to which a Thomas
Massie being smarter than his cohorts
would say well that's where it starts
you once that once that ability is there
you are you telling me that law
enforcement won't a ask for and get
access to the kill switch during a
high-speed
chase of course they
will in every world that will happen in
every world that that will happen so
yeah Thomas Massie was right it's a it's
a definitely a risk but it got passed
now I think uh self-driving cars might
make all of that obsolete so there's
probably a narrow window in which maybe
something could happen but by
2026 I don't know there's going to be a
lot of self-driving
cars they're they're already in some
cities right is it Austin is it Austin
that has self-driving taxis already and
they're already just all over the place
working fine San
Francisco yeah I think there's a few
places with him now all right uh here's
a simulation alert boop boop boop
simulation
alert um here's where we look for hints
that we live in a simulation and the
simulation has a sense of humor
right um Trump's attorney her name is
Alina
habba ha bbaa habba and there's a viral
picture picture going around of her at a
swimming pool and she's in
swimwear and she's unusually attractive
unusually attractive her last name is
habba Haba
Haba am I right Haba
Haba
now does that sound
sexist kind of a sexist joke wasn't it
yeah super sexist well well I'd like to
quote uh Norm McDonald in this situation
quote a woman wrote that joke now you
don't know what to do do
you because a woman wrote that joke I
actually borrowed it from a woman uh so
Marcel that's your
joke all right see it's much better the
nor McDonald the nor McDonald approach
works perfectly h a woman wrote that
joke now you don't know what to do do
you enormous great well Mr Beast you
know the uh huge uh social media monster
you know one of the biggest uh social
media presences very rich because of
it he uh helped Africa drill a bunch of
wells and uh brought clean drinking
water to half a million people wow I
guess the African country in which he
did that is pretty happy with him huh
yeah bet the African government who he
helped out big time they most love this
guy oh what' they say ooh no
uh uh it says the Kenyan government uh
uh they're mad at him because he helped
perpetuate The Stereotype that Africa is
quote dependent on handouts oh that
bastard oh that stupid bastard how dare
he bring clean drinking water to Kenya
when when that just insults their
ability to bring clean drinking water to
people well here's my general
observation so I've been
uh I've been wealthy for few decades now
since dilber took off and I've had the
opportunity to you know be in situations
where you could help somebody
out how often do you think
generosity works out for you or or even
works out for the other person or works
out in the way that you think
it's about
20% over a lifetime I would estimate
that maybe 20% of the time that you help
somebody they actually got helped and
then they say thank you sometimes
they'll pay you back like that's
happened I've actually had people pay me
back like really oh didn't even expect
that um about
20% 80% of the time you're trying to be
nice to somebody it won't work out at
all but here's what I would caution you
should any of you be rich or become rich
and be in a position to help somebody
out if you don't think those odds are
good enough well maybe you're not good
enough I say that with persuasion turned
up
20% wouldn't happen without
you imagine if you tried to help 10
people and it didn't work with eight but
2% of them you turned the life
around totally a success
yeah you should go into generosity with
an assumption that 80% doesn't work but
20% totally pays for it that 20% will be
important enough that you could lose all
the other ones and say I did good I'm
glad I did 10 Things I got two of them
through that's pretty good so just keep
that in mind you know it's it's like
business you know nine out of 10
businesses fail but if you keep trying
there's a pretty good chance you'll
you'll hit it once
um testosterone is continuing to decline
in America that seems pretty confirmed I
saw that uh Dr Andrew huberman podcast
he was talking to some expert Dr
Eisenberg and he does confirm that it
seems like each generation has lower
testosterone and uh reasons seem to be
obesity lack of physical activity you
know maybe some other things maybe maybe
cell phones some say I don't know
um but I would I would throw the food
supply in there for some
reason we seem to be just like a little
of Target the Obesity doesn't happen on
its
own does anybody think that the problem
is children are hungrier or lazier or
something and do you know what makes you
lazy bad
diet yeah bad diet makes you lazy H so I
think all of these problems are at the
food
supply if I had to guess I would say 80%
of the decrease in testosterone and 80%
of our health problems are just a
corrupted food
supply so I think that we're just so
accustomed to eating what's in the
grocery
store that our brains can't hold the
fact that it turned into poison because
it because it happened a little bit at a
time like there wasn't one day when all
your food was poisoned it was just well
here's a new product Oh we tested it
don't worry about it we add a little
sugar yeah we balance your salt and fat
and sugar but that's just legal that's
totally legal don't worry about it and
then pretty
soon you have nobody who can even uh you
know get into the Armed Forces cuz they
can't pass the test that's where you end
up I think it's food
supply I I have a strong strong
intuition that there's this whole
constellation of American problems from
Behavior Behavior to testosterone to
health and it's our our food supply is
poison now if you don't believe that try
eating clean for six
months yeah try it it's really really
hard first of all and by clean I mean
avoiding preservatives that's really
hard
avoiding the worst kind of carbs and
sugar and avoiding anything that was uh
designed to be
addictive so I think you all know now
that the food industry learned that if
you get the right amount of fat sugar
and salt you it's actually addictive
like just like a drug is addictive and
so a lot of you know packaged
preformatted food is engineered to be a
drug to actually be addictive so but if
you buy broccoli nobody engineered the
broccoli right the broccoli good spinach
nobody engineered that e spinach so you
do that for uh you do that for 6 months
you'll have no question in your mind
that the food supply is poisoned you you
won't have the slightest doubt now it's
very hard to do that and it's expensive
too so there's a good reason people
don't do it but biggest problem in
America you know besides the debt
uh I saw Chuck kesto post I need a fact
check on this but I think it's true that
according to CNN poll uh Biden now
Trails Trump by Four Points Nationwide
among black
men is that
true that Trump is
leading
substantially with black men in
America I I feel like I need a fact
check on that one I mean there's a
source given but I didn't I didn't see
it the
source well um if it is true it would be
suggestive that my longtime prediction
is uh materializing and my prediction
was that over time the Democrats would
be more and more the party of
women and that the Republicans would be
become more and more the party of
men and that you could almost say it's a
low testosterone versus High T
testosterone system I I think we can say
directly there's something different
about Democrat
men am I off base you just look at them
you just look at them there there's
clearly a testosterone difference
between the Democrats on average right
now they're plenty of bodybuilder
Democrats right so everything I say is
just sort of this you know General
average thing has nothing to do with any
individual if you're a Democrat and got
a high tea that's fine you there's
plenty of you I'm sure of it uh but in
general we're evolving to a party that
the women are in control and the men who
are comfortable with
that probably fall into a a certain
category right they're comfortable with
female
control on the Republican side it's
people who are more comfortable with you
know you men making certain kinds of
decisions and uh and women who like that
environment you know we think that's
that works for
so I'm not
surprised if it turns out this is true
that black men would start to Trend
Republican where black women and women
of all type would start you know to
become Democrat and abortion of
course would obviously be the big reason
for that but I think Trump just appeals
to a certain kind of
man right Trump is the you know the the
man-man high high testosterone kind of
vibe so you could totally understand and
especially I hate to say it but there's
nothing more manly than having legal
troubles I hate to say it but it's very
male to be in trouble with the courts
right most jails are fill of men
as soon as you hear legal trouble legal
trouble legal trouble you think male
don't you like automatically if I say uh
there's there's this individual who's
got 91
charges don't you automatically think
male right even if the charges are
 you automatically well mail so
it doesn't surprise me at all every
everything about this situation suggests
that that men will Trend
Republican and get their you know guns
and pickup trucks and the men who stay
in Democrats you may be painting their
fingernails and exploring their
sexuality and it's going to be very
different groups of
people all right um but there's nothing
wrong with
that uh uh if I if I gave you the
impression that that means one is the
good side I wasn't saying that there's
nothing wrong with either side the
people are fine nothing wrong with
people I like all the people is just a
predictable effect that's all I'm just
predicting it I'm not saying it's bad or
good well the uh the pentagon's uh UFO
boss is going to step step down next
month says Politico so I guess the
Pentagon had a head guy uh I think it
was a guy in charge of
UFOs may I
say of all the jobs in the
world that was the best one how do you
quit that job it it's kind of the
perfect Wall-E job you know WALL-E the
character from Dilbert who's who's
always trying to get away with stuff and
have a have an easy job can you imagine
that conversation with the boss hey uh
you know whatever is Colonel Wall-E I
don't know what rank he was but hey
Colonel Wall-E how you doing on those
UFOs great great you I'll bet you can't
wait to see the grainy photos that I've
got now I've got twice as many grainy
photos as we've ever seen
before are they real well some people
say so best job ever best job because
you're not even going out and looking
for the the information people just give
it to you oh here's another video grainy
video throw it on throw it on the pile
I'll add that to my
PowerPoint best
job all right there's a CNN poll uh um
asking Americans
voters um if they think Biden has the
quote stamina and sharpness to serve as
president I close my eyes and watch the
miracle of the smartest viewers in all
of politics go how many people what
percentage said that Biden has the
stamina
25% how do you do this how do you keep
getting this right I just asked the
question question and you know the polls
before they're even ped so this is from
a CNN
poll well I could not be more impressed
with all of you by the way if there are
any new people here if you stay long
enough you will learn how to do this
right just stay with us it it'll slowly
it'll start occurring to you and you'll
be begin to see it yeah pretty soon you
too will know the answer to the polls
before they're asked
yeah that's just one of the benefits I I
I provide I teach you how to do
that well there's a uh CNN did some po
um survey by
SSRS and they ask registers registered
voters you know who they'd vote for and
they say it would be a narrow win for
Trump according to a CNN sponsored
survey a narrow win for Trump
now I've got a problem with that because
I think they're predicting the only
thing that can't happen in America a
narrow win for Trump now I don't want to
say that I don't trust the election
system but I don't trust the election
system I've not seen any indication that
our past elections were rigged I've seen
no evidence of that however I have seen
evidence that every time you have a way
to check a big National American
institution they are always
corrupt
so it could be the most amazing thing in
the world if we had 50 state elections
that were not corrupt when everything
else is that would be kind of amazing
but I have no specific evidence of any
corruption no specific but I do think
the least likely outcome is a narrow win
for Trump I think he either has to crush
it or it'll be cheated away from him
does anybody
disagree I don't think a narrow wi is
even
possible we'll see I'd love to be wrong
about it I mean if I'm wrong on this one
please remind
me but it doesn't seem like it's
possible
um here's the funniest story so recently
meta the Facebook parent company uh
created an AI called Galactica and his
job was to make sense of science so so
science is producing you know so many
findings and they're complicated and
they you would find them in different
places that even if you're an expert in
the field it's hard to know what's going
on there's too many things going on so
the idea was to use AI to figure out all
the things that are going on and then
summarize them uh which seems like
exactly the sort of thing AI can do am I
right would you agree the AI is sort of
perfect for that because it can see
everything and it can process it fast
and it can you know put it in
words and that's what it does good how
do you think it turned
out well they had to disband it or or
pull back because um it kept producing
nonsense so when artificial intelligence
which seems to work in many different
contexts when it was applied to science
It produced word salad and
nonsense what do you think that was do
you think the AI was
broken the way the article is written is
suggests that the problem was the that
the AI was not sufficient to the task
well that's one possibility you know
what the other possibility is that when
you tell an AI to go look at the
science in the context of over half of
all reviewed peer- reviewed papers not
holding
up and the fact that most of the rest of
the science is just marketing
departments for big
companies and then you look at climate
change then you look at
Co and that's what it was trained
on presumably it was trained on a whole
bunch of papers that are usually
wrong plus topics that are so
politicized that everything about them
was wrong or could be wrong or or is
doubted or there's two stories
Etc so what we learned the way it was
reported by the news who were all uh
idiots is that the AI was not up to the
task
I don't think that's what was going
on I think that the AI correctly figured
out I mean in an indirect way the
science is mostly
nonsense because we know that to be true
it's mostly
nonsense meaning that most you know most
early science is wrong now that doesn't
mean that science isn't still our best
tool for understanding the world it is
it's still the best tool I nothing is
even close but the nature of science is
that you're wrong most of the time until
you get something right and then you got
to got to work on keeping it right but
while you're keep while you're
confirming something's right there are
going to be three new theories that say
it's probably wrong and they have pretty
good
reasons how would AI sort that
out do you know how a human sorts that
out do you know how a human decides
which uh climate model to
favor do you know how a human decides if
climate change is real or a
hoax fear money and
ignorance bias job
 that's how we decide what is
science now certainly there are some
things that everybody agrees on you know
but basically by the time you hear about
science or the science is commercialized
it's so bastardized by human beings that
whatever science happened is
unrecognizable or
irrelevant right how in the world could
AI ever tell you what's true when humans
can't do
it humans can't do
it so AI is trained on what humans can
do not on what they can't do so are you
surprised Ed that the field of science
being mostly hoaxes and and bad
ideas that when AI looked at it to find
out what was
true it broke down and just gave you
nonsense because it's it's an unsolvable
puzzle now remember I told you that um
ai's biggest impact and you're not going
to see it
coming is what it teaches you about
human
Minds this is it we learned that
something like intelligence can be
created just by looking at the patterns
of words that people have
used that tells you that your
intelligence is not what you thought it
was that's why you repeat what you heard
on CNN or Fox
News because they gave you a word
pattern and then that word pattern you
was added to your word pattern and now
you just reflexively go to the pattern
that's most accessible accessible in
your brain from a source that you you
know appreciate
following so once you learn that your
your intelligence is not special it
really changes what you think of humans
and human intelligence which is why I
believe that AGI the the quote like real
intelligence that they say is coming
might be logically
impossible might be I have a strong
impulse that there's a limit to Ai and
the limit is largely what humans could
figure out and you know maybe with a few
little exceptions they'll come up with
some good ideas or something but I think
the limit is human intelligence I don't
think AI can break through it now that's
the most contrarian view in the world
because I think all AI people think they
can break through it and maybe the smart
money says they can you know if you look
at history the people who say something
can't be done are usually wrong right
but that's where I am I'm saying there
might be a logical reason not not an
engineering reason that they would
someday solve not a scientific reason
that they would someday solve but rather
a logical reason why you can't go past
it and I'll even go further if AGI ever
exceeded human abilities of intelligence
the humans would say well you got that
wrong for example let's say AGI looked
at the war the war in Gaza and they said
uh I've picked the winner uh one of
these sides is basically right I use my
advanced intelligence to decide who's
right and who's wrong what would the
humans
do ignore it turn it off tell you it's
not
credible I I just don't think logically
you can surpass your human intelligence
without humans turning it off now of
course it will in some you know math and
you real technical stuff of course it
will in writing code you know there'll
be a whole bunch of technical places
where it definitely exceeds humans in
speed if nothing else but
intelligence I don't know we wouldn't
recognize it if we saw it so that's a
problem what happens if the computer is
genuinely more intelligence than human
do you think you could
tell you could not tell you would say
it's stupid and broken because it
doesn't agree with you and you know
you're
right so that's what's ahead of us um so
what we learned is that science was more
 than we thought I don't think
the ey was
broken
um I continue to watch closely the
ability of grock the X based AI to do
humor uh obviously you know my area I'm
trying to figure out when I'm going to
be replaced and since grock was trained
on the humor of Douglas Adams famously
some would say that the the funniest
humor writer of all time some would say
um so it actually is kind of
funny I'm I'm going to actually say huh
because I read some responses in which
somebody said uh one of them was uh Hey
AI can you roast
yourself so it actually did a roast of
itself as an AI and insulted itself but
here are some of the words it it used to
compare itself uh dumpster fire
hemorrhoid pretzel black hole cockroach
root canal right now I had sentences
around those but here's my
takeaway this is what I call CEO level
humor CEO level humor and that means if
you were a CEO and you were talking to
your staff or any large group and you
use the jokes that grock already can do
you know like these ones that say
dumpster fire hemorrhoid prel black ho
cockroach root canal your audience would
laugh at that and they would genuinely
laugh because the CEO comparing anything
to a cockroach would make you laugh it
wouldn't even matter what it
was if your CEO ever used the word
hemorrhoid when referring to a Compu
let's say a competitor or something
that's not working in the company you
would laugh if your CEO says hemorrhoid
you're laughing right that's CEO level
humor
and I often tell people that the type of
humor that works is completely dependent
on the nature of how it's being
viewed live
audience uh loves CEO level humor kind
of obvious things you've heard before
I'm just being a little bit a little bit
let's say
inappropriate and that and that's that's
like the funniest thing I remember when
I worked at the phone company this this
president or CEO CEO did a All Hands
meeting one day and told the joke it was
a naughty joke that normally wouldn't be
a huge laugh but because it came from
the CEO and it was naughty huge laugh
huge laugh right but here's what it's
not grock AI is funny at the CEO level
I'll call that corporate humor but it's
nowhere near Dave Chappelle right the
Dave Chappelle level it's nowhere near
that um let me give you another example
of what it's not
near there's a video of uh Palestinian
children um allegedly the video shows
them little second graders or so they
look about that age and they're doing a
school play in which they're uh learning
to murder Israelis to become
Martyrs that's the second grade school
play for at least some
Palestinians now uh in a comment to that
Dave
Rubin uh quote tweeted it and he said
quote uh I was the lower right Muller in
my second grade play now that's
funny could AI do
that AI can't do
that maybe someday but here's something
that that you didn't see coming a a lot
of humor is
self-deprecating Right a lot of public
humor is
self-deprecating AI will never be able
to do self-deprecating
humor there's nothing that an AI could
say about itself that you would find
funny so the AI can say oh you know I I
always get that one wrong or something
it just wouldn't be funny you just say
okay you're programmed to say that it's
it's only when a human says it and you
can put yourself in the human's mind and
you can relate to the human that has any
power at all so that's something that
you know a professional humorist Dave
ruin would know and this is like one of
the best Tweets I just let I I read it
about 10 times because there's no
there's no
word um extra let me read this again I
was the lower right Moler in my second
grade play the fact that he said lower
right instead of just a
Moler actually makes it
funnier because you know the specificity
of it just adds a little human element
would AI have to say lower right would
would
AI would AI know that lower right Moler
is funnier than
Moler not yet not yet maybe someday but
not yet so the entire I believe the
entire um category of self-deprecating
humor is not
available now you know what else is not
available to
AI insulting other people the way you
might probably not now I think mus AI
will have that um possibility so it
might actually be able to do it but
you're not going to think it's as funny
as if it came from a person so here's
your lesson on humor
it's not the it's not just the joke you
know in the Dave Rubin example you can
see that's a well- constructed sentence
so that's good engineering but it also
came from Dave right you imagined the
young Dave Rubin in second grade that's
the whole game when you imagined him as
this you know lower right Moler and then
you compared it in your mind to humas
you know dying as dying as Martyrs it's
hilarious no AI can do that
yet all right um
next uh I saw this video it must have
been during a the 2016 election where no
it must have been during
the the first Biden election there was a
Biden bus campaign bus and as a prank
political prank it was be it was being
followed by a hearse that was labeled
the hearse was labeled the uh Foundation
suicide
limo and it just drove behind the Biden
bus just you know it was just in the you
know the Entourage basically it was just
the last one was was a now that's pretty
funny do you think AI could have come up
with that
idea probably not probably not not yet
but it seems to me that that would be
the perfect prank to resurrect so so to
speak for any Biden uh stuff I would
change it from the Hillary suicide thing
but uh I would have a
hearse following his
Entourage and just making it look like
it's a natural part of the
Entourage don't even explain it don't
even put any words on it you simply have
the hearse following Biden around
wherever he goes no words necessary
that's
funny right remember visual persuasion
is just killer that would be the
ultimate visual persuasion every time
you see them you that visual imagery as
soon as people see you and then they
think a
hearse we're done here that would be the
end of
it all right uh marjerie Taylor green
introduced some legislation to reduce
the pay of Secretary of church
Transportation P Buddha judge salary to
$1 because of quote Buddha's failure to
serve the American
people um and margorie Taylor green
specifically pointed out bedge staged
fake bike rides you know he would take
his bike out of the SUV and go the last
mile on the bike uh but she calls him po
Pete uh stage fake bike rides to the
White House and use private planes
funded by taxpayers to receive rewards
to receive awards for the way certain
people have sex she
said receiving awards for the way
certain people have sex I think I think
what she means is that he wins an award
for being gay but also accomplishing
something so the way she words that is
winning awards for the way certain
people have
[Laughter]
sex
all right now generally speaking I would
be opposed to gimicky things in Congress
and I would say to myself Congress you
should be doing the serious work of the
people not these frivolous you know try
to get attention things
but honestly this is the funniest the
funniest legislation I've seen and you
know margerie Taylor green can do funny
legislation all day long because it's
the best it's the best value of getting
out of Congress like I'm trying to think
what else they did that I enjoyed this
year and I couldn't think of anything I
couldn't think of anything they did that
I wanted them to do but I definitely
like this I got a story out of it I
laughed she made a point she got some
attention for it that's of course trying
to point out Buddha
judges you know qualities so I don't
know I can't hate it because it's
funny now here's something that just I
don't even know what to to think about
this next story so you probably know
that uh political commentator uh Jen
weager I've never known how to say his
name because I always say it on my live
stream but you can't really correct me
because I'm just reading text is it
Jen Jen weager right that's the correct
pronunciation or Chen CH
Chen try Chen wigger all right I do try
I do try to get his name right right
even if I disagree with him on something
try to get his name right so I'm not
doing this intentially I'm just really
bad on names all right so the story
about him is uh you know he says he
sends a post on X he says if Biden
refuses to drop out since he is
guaranteed loss it'll force me to just
flat out beat him because he's running
for president now so Jen is running for
president he is the weakest major
candidate I have ever seen
if no one else gets into the race I will
shock the world and catch
Biden
wow I thought to myself wow you know
maybe he actually has a
chance because if Biden drops out you
know new nuub isn't guaranteed I mean
he's got the best chance but you know
maybe maybe Chen can give him a run and
then I saw that a community note was
added to Jen's uh post and the community
the Community note says the US
Constitution requires that any candidate
for president be a natural-born citizen
of the United States weager or Iger was
born in
turkey and was not a US citizen at the
time of birth he is not eligible to
run and has already been denied ballot
access in
Nevada how in the world did he get this
far
how in the world did we think he was
really running for president when he's
not even legally allowed now if he
continues
running while while knowing that he is
not even eligible to
run I again I'm going to I'm going to
give him I'm going to give him the win
because it would be like a good Margery
Taylor green legislation play that the
that the entire thing is to make some
other
points that's fine
you know if if Chen wants to keep
running knowing that he can't actually
be in the ballot just so he can get that
attention and stuff I'm all for it yeah
I like it keep doing
it all right uh I saw a clip of uh Jesse
Waters from Fox News I guess he had a
guest on his Show recently uh he was
sort of quing the guest and one of the
guests who is an excia guy I guess uh
says the CIA rigged the 2020 election
because Trump threatened its drug
trafficking the the cartels and the idea
here is that the
CIA uh goes easy on the cartels because
they're sharing the money and I don't
know where the money goes to I don't
know if they use it for dirty tricks or
just line their pockets or to control
our government or what but the idea is
that uh the obvious
reason that you don't see
uh the CIA eliminating the cartels
because one believes that that would be
possible it looks like nothing's
happening is because they don't want it
to happen and that the CIA has enough
power to make it
happen which would suggest that the CIA
would be behind the open borders as
well now what do you think of
that I would say I personally have no
evidence that could confirm such a thing
so uh and then I would also say that uh
the CIA are trained
Liars so even somebody who's
excia my first thought is well you are a
trained
liar I mean that was what you did for a
living for a while uh so I would say The
credibility is
low but I worry because it's too perfect
you know too on the nose it does look
like exactly what you
suspected yeah uh yeah Iran Contra CIA
used drug profits to fund block so so
it's not without precedent it wouldn't
be
unprecedented I just don't have direct
knowledge that it's true so I can't say
it's true but it sure is interesting
that an xcia person says it's true
directly and it it would match all
observation so 100% of what we observe
to be happening would be compatible with
this idea but that doesn't make it
true all right
um Elon musk's neurolink company they're
looking for a volunteer to have a piece
of their skull cut open by a robotic
surgeon so that the robotic surgeon can
insert a thin wires and electrodes into
your
brain so any
volunteers um I have just one question
before I
volunteer If this means I don't have to
bring my phone with me everywhere I
go I'm
in make me a cyborg bastard make me a
cyborg I want to be a
cyborg no I'm just joking as somebody
pointed out the moment you've got this
uh chip in your head the government will
know what you're doing all the
time you know now I do believe that it's
not on mus intention to put anything in
your skull that would make you you know
trackable or lose your security or
anything but I don't know if you'll
always be here so I think is you know at
the point we all get chipped which seems
inevitable well eventually we're going
to be
cyborgs all right Humanity will be
cyborgs I don't think there's any doubt
about that or at least a lot of us will
be so I don't mean it really I wouldn't
get that to surgery yet
but uh I'd love to not forget my phone
every 10
minutes all right how many of you
believe that Gaza will be rebuilt and
the locals will be invited back to a
fresh new Gaza uh when it's all
done I see Zero no no no sure no no no
no Canal will be built well there
there's one conspiracy theory that says
that Israel really wants to build a
canal that would go from the I guess the
Suz
to uh the Mediterranean uh it would
basically compete with the canal that's
there but they don't have as much
control over now if Israel had its own
Canal the proposed route goes right
through Gaza coincidence um but I don't
know what to think about that it it
seems unlikely to me that all of their
policies are around a canal but it does
seem likely that you know follow the
money explains a lot of stuff so it
might be it might be an ambition by some
people you know it's not why Netanyahu
is responding hard he had to do that no
matter what but people are pointing that
out as a variable I don't know how real
it is can anybody give me a fact check
on
that is that something the Israel really
really wanted or is it just something
that somebody floated at one point
it might be just something that somebody
floated at one point and it's you know
not terribly important to anything
that's happening today but to the
question of will Gaza be rebuilt and the
locals be invited back in well that
would be the dumbest thing that Israel
could do why would you just rebuild the
same
problem because there's no amount of uh
you know Israel control over the
population that would keep Hamas from
reemerging
to me it seems obvious that the
long-term goal is to make it
uninhabitable well medium-term it it let
me say if I were Israel this is what I
would do I would never under any
circumstances allow Hamas to be
rebuilt governed by
anybody I don't think I would do it
because it and here's why you know the
when I told you about the uh Dave Rubin
post about the uh video of the little
kids being trained to uh grow up to be
martyrs and kill Israelis kill the
Jews I don't think you can move those
children back into Gaza and expect a
good
outcome I mean you're just begging for
the same situation to happen again maybe
worse so I think what's going to happen
here's my
prediction uh I'm going to call this the
oops
strategy the oops
strategy what Israel can't say is oh
we're totally going to leave this
uninhabited they can't say that that
would that would be too genocidal
sounding here's what they also can't say
we're going to rebuild
it um so it's a you know nice vital uh
Palestinian City nope can't say that it
wouldn't fly
internally so what can they do so they
can't say they'll rebuild it and they
can't say that it will forever not be
rebuilt so what what's in between what
could possibly be in between building it
and not building
it and the answer is
oops do you know what that looks like so
the aquafer and the water source for uh
for Gaza is an aquafer in other words
it's it's below their
land we've already heard that if you
blow up the tunnels
you know or you know you mess around
with it too much the destruction above
land will pollute what's below below the
ground so it could make the entire water
supply the
aquifer um
unusable
oops you know we would love somebody to
rebuild Gaza in fact will even will even
make it
possible but ah too bad they don't have
any water source you know if only we
could have prevented that from happening
but you know if they're in tunnels you
have to go after the tunnels you know we
flattened a few tunnels and oops the
water
supply man I you know and of course
we're not going to supply from the
outside anymore because you know we want
to cut ourselves off from that so well
they could have a desalinization plant
you just have to find a friendly country
who's willing to put a nuclear facility
in Gaza and you know train a lot of the
locals to work with nuclear
energy who's going to do that yeah I
think Mr Beast would say no to
that Iran yeah but nobody's going to
allow Iran to do
it so that's my prediction it's the oops
strategy we really really did expect
this to be rebuilt but ah gosh war war
is terrible and I don't know could it
could be 20 years before we get this
water supply thing fixed I I think
Israel's best play would be to oops keep
it
depopulated and wait 20 years and then
populate it with
settlers because it's not going to
change anybody's you know murderous
intentions they're going to be just as
murderous either
way all right and there's a story about
Rasheed Talib being uh what was she
censured for tweeting something that add
the phrase from The River To The Sea
which uh most people believe means to
eliminate Israel and kill all the Jews
but some people are saying no no it's
just sort of a saying it's just the way
we talk okay I'm not buying that at all
so I think that was a good centure I
think that one was
appropriate yeah one of the odds that T
would sound so much like
Taliban
simulation um did she tweet it or did
she say it in a rally I know she tweeted
something that said
it um but in a rally was she part of the
part of a chant as well I feel like I
remember
that was she so I'm seeing yeses on that
yeah I think she was part of a protest
in which they chanted that including
her
all right let me see if I handled all my
many many thoughts who's going to watch
the uh debate
tonight any debate Watchers tonight
good well I think I covered everything
wow this might be my best live stream
ever and and they keep getting better so
I mean like I I can't wait for tomorrow
it's going to be so good all right
we ran long as I expected YouTube thanks
for joining and I will see you tomorrow
remember gets better every
day
