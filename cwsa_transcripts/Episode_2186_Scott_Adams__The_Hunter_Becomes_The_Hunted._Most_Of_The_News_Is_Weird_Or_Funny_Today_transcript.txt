do
do do do do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the higher light of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
some people think there's a better time
in the history of the universe but not
really
this is really the best time in the
whole history of everything this is the
best it gets
sorry
uh but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels which nobody has
ever experienced all you need is
a cup of mug or a glass a tanker jealous
of Stein again teen Joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine to the day the thing that makes
everything better it's gold the
simultaneous sip
go
well let's talk about the news do you
think the news today is oh I don't know
important news
is there a lot of important news
happening today no nope nothing like
that
um but we do have news about
synchronized whales
so we have a report of Wales doing
synchronized jumping right there's a
picture of three whales jumping
synchronized
now this comes on the heels of reports
about the whales attacking
sailing ships
that's right
now they're attacking sailing ships and
also doing some kind of military
training it looks like they're doing
synchronized jumping which would be
their form of marching
it does appear that the oceans are
starting to organize Against Humanity
I would look out for the the other sea
creatures to start joining in
it's not going to be a problem
unless they form some kind of an
alliance
and start sharing weapons
but I would look out for the Stingrays
and the swordfish
if the swordfish joined with the uh the
whales we've got a real problem
there's going to be some stinging and
sorting
all right well forget about that
um I saw Jack posabic tweet who says
that uh Trump called on all Republican
Challengers to drop out of the way race
and divert all of their all their money
to finance the largest ballot harvesting
operation the world has ever seen
I didn't see the news story but that
really happened right
I
I when when Trump says anything
it's almost like you can tell that he
said it now I'm assuming you know Jack
usually has the right information so I'm
sure I'm sure he's right
but don't you love that it's not just
you should do a ballast art
it would be simple and ordinary
to say you should do ballot harvesting
the same as the Democrats
but but Trump doesn't say that he says
he wants to have the the largest ballot
harvesting operation the world has ever
seen
the biggest one the world has ever seen
and by the way that's exactly right
do you think you should be going small
on ballot harvesting No it should be the
biggest thing that has ever done in the
history of doing things if you're going
to do it at all
you gotta go you gotta go balls to the
wall and just do it like crazy it
wouldn't make any sense to just try to
match them well they did some of that so
we'll do some of that if the if the
loophole if you want to call it the
loophole or the opportunity
if it exists and if it's legal
you should do the hell out of it like
you know Trump's right you should do it
like it's never been done before or
or get out of the race because if you're
not going to compete using all the rules
you're not really trying
I don't know I don't know why this is so
simple
and yet Trump is the one who keeps
getting it right
right just just how simply you say it
should be the biggest one the world's
ever seen that is precisely the right
answer the biggest one the world's ever
seen
well let's talk about uh you know Devin
Archer coming up and all that stuff so
uh Rasmussen did a poll asking people
what they think about the Biden crime
family if I can use my own my own term
there uh
according to Rasmussen 60 percent of
likely voters believe the president has
been part of an illegal cover-up to hide
his involvement in his son Hunter's
foreign business
60 percent
think he's involved in an illegal
cover-up of an influence buying scheme
sixty percent how in the world could he
win an election
I mean seriously how could you possibly
win this election of 60 of the country
thinks you're probably probably doing
something super illegal
all right what else uh but the most the
most surprising thing is if you want to
see how how ridiculous this has become
uh guess what percentage of people
polled say it is not at all likely
that the president is involved in kind
of a cover-up of any kind of a any kind
of schemes or anything no here's the
surprising part
they couldn't even get 25 percent to say
it was okay
they couldn't even get 25 percent
just imagine that if I've taught you
anything it's that 25 of respondents to
polls will get every question wrong
maybe it's a different 25 but it's not
like this weird consistently 25 will be
wrong about everything
but they got it all the way down to 18
this so the
the ones who say is not at all likely
that Biden has been illegally covering
up his role only 18 believe it is not at
all likely
only 18 percent
think it's not at all likely he's
involved in an insanely important crime
that's really relevant to the office of
the presidency
Eddie's going to win
so he's going to win without campaigning
with these with these numbers of people
who believe is involved in a major crime
does it worry you at all that the
Democrats don't seem to be panicked
that they can win without campaigning
and having you know somebody with these
kind of numbers
well we'll talk about the numbers a
little bit more a little later we'll get
back to that
um
I've got a campaign idea
that only Trump could pull off
now you know Rama Swami could pull it
off too but it doesn't it doesn't
exactly fit his brand as well
but so I'll tell you what it is
you you've seen the stats that show that
people who identify with the left
have the vastly worse mental health have
you all seen that those stats the people
associated with the political right they
got their problems of course but is
nowhere near
the Democrats and their mental health
situations now
what what do people care about
if you said Scott
tell me the policies and you know tell
me what you care about
I would probably incorrectly tell you
stuff like oh tax rates and protect the
border and policies and my policies in
Ukraine right so that would be the
typical answer what do you care about in
politics and I would just list those
things I talk about but do I really care
about those things
or do I care about how I feel right now
as I'm sitting in this chair which one
do I care more about climate change
policy
or my current feeling as I'm sitting
here talking to you right now
I care about right now
I care about how I feel now I'm happy to
report
I feel great
I feel great I'm I'm mentally and
physically
I'm just cooking at 100 right now I
don't I don't have a freaking problem in
the world honestly honestly I'm gonna go
through the entire day without a problem
nothing
no health problems no mental problems I
won't be bored I'll be doing some useful
stuff I'm gonna have a great day I don't
know the details but it'll be yesterday
was great the day before it was pretty
terrific
I don't have anything but good days
right however
I do note that many many people special
on the left are having mental problems
now it's it's not a big mystery right
I I tweeted uh that they're uh
there are three facts of the mystery
so the three facts are that the people
on the left are being taught that
climate is going to kill them right the
entire world that they live on they
can't escape it and it's doomed
two things you need to know about the
planet if and you're on the left you
can't get off it you know it will be too
long before Elon could get you a rocket
right off of Earth so you're trapped on
the earth and it's gonna blow up with or
you're just gonna burn up with all the
climate change
then you're also taught that you are
either a victim or an oppressor if
you're a victim oh I'm sorry and if
you're a presser I'm twice as sorry oh
my god you're an oppressor how do you
live with yourself oppressor
plus you're surrounded by white
supremacists who are trying to kill you
all
so imagine if that was your reality
that's sort of you know semi-reality on
the left
imagine that's reality it's it's total
Mental Health
you know creation
so here's the idea
what if
you're going to love this idea that's
why I'm like I'm like
creeping up to it because when you hear
it you're just gonna say Oh shoot that's
a good idea you ready
Trump should tell you he's going to help
your mental health
just say it directly say look we got a
massive mental health problem and a lot
of it is because you're believing fake
news
if you believe the fake news is not good
for you
and you should probably find a way to
back off it
right at the very least you should
sample the news from both sides
but right now you're you're just talking
yourself into mental health problems by
listening to The Click bait alarmists
we're trying to get you worked up so
they can make money
your mental health is because somebody
else is making money off of you
I'm not trying to make money off of you
I want you to feel good I want you to be
healthy mentally and physically and if
you'd like to know how
about voting for me and I'll show you
how
but just but just imagine this the
the miracle of
politics and you tell me if I'm wrong
the mirror the miracle of good politics
is when the politician can make you feel
something in your actual day-to-day life
right you don't win because you've got a
concept oh I've got a good concept
your concept doesn't make me feel
anything
so when Trump won it's because he made
people feel something
that seemed really relevant to their
daily activities
but right now this mental health problem
is the biggest thing that people are
feeling
they're feeling a gigantic mental health
burden you know they also feel economic
risks Etc but you can make a case for
that too
do you want to feel comfortable in your
economic life do you want to feel
comfortable in how you feel about the
risks in the world do you want to feel
comfortable that something is being
taken care of
he Trump could sell you mental health
Trump could sell you mental health and
you would buy it you would actually buy
it now not every person right politics
is all about getting that five percent
to switch over but you can certainly get
five percent to say you know what I do
have a huge mental health problem and he
is offering me something that sounds
like it could be a solution if you've
got a big mental health problem anxiety
or depression whatever
wouldn't you do almost anything to just
see if it made a difference
you know if somebody said take a walk
around the block it'll make you feel
better you'd think well I should try it
because what I'm doing now isn't working
so I think it would be it would be
um
completely revolutionary
for a politician to say you know what
you feel bad every day when you wake up
and I'm gonna fix that
I'm gonna make you feel better
just directly I'll make you feel better
it's very powerful
all right even CNN is reporting at least
in an opinion piece Harry Anton uh that
Trump could win
now when CNN is saying you know a
headline
Trump very well could win
do you think that's a warning shot to
the bidens to get out of the race or Joe
Biden together the race
I I feel like CNN is tapping him on the
shoulder as hard as they can tap you
know
I'm just reminding you the polls blah
blah blah so the argument for why he's
in better shape apparently Trump is
polling better now than at any time in
2020.
were you aware of that
in 2020 he was never polling against
Biden nearly as well as he is now
so he's he's improving in power and a
lot of the a lot of polls are showing
him slightly had not enough to beat the
margin of error but
consistently
he's Thai or ahead
you know again not above the margin of
error now that was never the case
apparently that was never the case in
2020. now the caveat here is that CNN
says based on polling that CNN finds
acceptable right so they have their own
standard of which ones they believe but
their own polls the ones they say are
acceptable
are now showing that Trump is starting
to get a bite on this that it would be
hard to shake him off
so their only play is to arrest him or
give him some kind of legal problems and
the more they do the more illegitimate
they seem
and probably the more support he gets I
mean he can sell that kind of it all
right let me ask you have you noticed
that Trump has done everything right
lately
I can't think of an exception but hasn't
he done everything right and by that I
mean he hasn't caused a new problem
right there's not a new problem
and he said he said news making things
that people want to hear
and I believe he's successfully
running a general campaign already
right so he's he's not he's not just
going base base base base he's actually
already in the General in terms of his
policies
I don't know what's going to stop him
it's hard to imagine anything stopping
him
um you know I I'll remind you that I'm
still supporting fake
I'd rather have the younger you know the
younger high quality candidate
to find a choice
um
but I would also love
Trump vivekis vice president and uh
DeSantis as Attorney General
or
or Ted Cruz about Ted Cruz as Attorney
General
right so the the big the big problem
that anybody has with Trump as a
president well one of the big problems
is you worry that he's going to hire
good people
right you worry that he would hire good
people but I feel like he could hire
good people if he wanted to
I feel like he does have that option now
because it feels different if he wins
again
it's going to be the greatest
uh well it'd be one of the greatest
comebacks of all time but it would also
validate
you know that he wasn't so bad the first
time
so things would look really different if
Trump won again and then and since they
don't need to worry about him winning
re-election
maybe he gets treated differently
because they don't have to worry about
another four years it'd be his last four
years
I doubt they would really go balls to
the wall to try to remove him before his
turn was over
they might
all right
so Devin Archer is scheduled to testify
to Congress today I understand now he's
he is or was Hunter's business partner
and he's got all the goods on the big
guy and
where the money went and all that stuff
there's a fake news report about this
that says that the Department of Justice
was trying to arrest him to keep him
from testifying in front of Congress in
other words kind of shut him up by
arresting him
but that appears to be fake news right
so the real news is that the Department
of Justice did uh send him a letter to a
report to jail
but it's a negotiated time it doesn't
mean today so today you should be fine
his lawyers say oh no no problem but
there is there is a separate action on
the separate case
to which he might go to jail or I he has
to report to jail I guess
all right
um
all right he's a fine Governor yes he is
you know I keep seeing clips of DeSantis
I'll tell you he uh
he he takes he takes boring to the next
level
and I hate to
I hate to act like being exciting should
be a requirement for the job because it
absolutely isn't if we ended up with a
president DeSantis I would be completely
happy I wouldn't have a I wouldn't have
a problem in the world with that
but but when he runs against Trump he
just disappears a little bit doesn't he
it's just hard to see him the light is
so blinding you you just don't even
notice him
um all right so Devin Archer should
light things up today now given that
Devin Archer
uh I would imagine that anybody on the
left or right no matter what you think
of Biden don't you think that they would
believe whatever Devin Archer says to
Congress
in other words if Devin Archer says oh
yeah totally corrupt situation
I was right in the middle of it I was
his business partner it's not hearsay I
was in the room I could tell you for
sure so if it goes that way
do you think even the left will believe
it
if his own business partner just
completely rolls over and says all right
I'll just tell you everything
I think 25 won't believe it
but I think we're I think we've reached
a weird situation
and the situation is I believe
that probably a good I don't know
at least a third of the people who say
they don't believe the charges really do
or something in that order
there will be people who would never
admit they believe the charges
but they do because they don't want
their team to be wrong so instead of
saying well okay you've convinced me
that it was always a Biden crime family
how many of them are going to say you
know I didn't think that was a thing but
now that you've shown me the evidence it
does look like it was a gigantically
unethical situation at least I don't
know if it's illegal
um
I don't think they will I think people
will say you know uh Joe Biden's getting
up there at age
and they'll just find some other reason
why he's not their first choice they'll
just find some other reason because it's
just too hard for brains to say it was
right in front of me this whole time and
I couldn't see until now
it's just hard for a brain to to do that
in public
so I think that we have way more we
meaning in the country has way more
Democrats who understand the Biden crime
family situation then we'll admit it out
loud
let me ask you this
do you think there's even one person in
the media
left or right
who believes that these Chargers are not
legitimate you know the accusations
about the Biden crime family situation
do you think there's anybody in the news
business no no the people in the news
business are all completely aware of
what's going on
it's only their customers you know their
viewers that they're fooling but there's
nobody who's sitting in the you know the
host chair of a major Network
who has any any confusion whatsoever
about what happened with the bidens no
confusion at all yeah Joyride no
confusion over men completely
understands at this point
they're not going to say it
but they do now this brings us to
um
Jim Gaffigan on Joe Rogan now I
mentioned it before but he's still
trending
now the the take that a lot of people
had is that poor uh Jim Gaffigan
was you know deluded by his new sources
and you know sort of a lefty
anti-trumper and that he ran into the
buzzsaw of Joe Rogan
who he's certainly not a pro Trumper per
se but he simply had more accurate
information about the various stories
that Jim was concerned about
and watching watching Joe Rogan explain
to to Jim Gaffigan things that the
people on the left have never heard
before
was fascinating
and also interesting to your Jim
say things he thought were true because
the news told them they were
let me give you an example
Jim Gaffigan says you know or he seems
to indicate on Joe Rogan there was
obvious and should be obvious to
everyone
that Trump is the most corrupt president
ever
and that well you know Biden might have
some issues there's no competition
between who's more corrupt
now what do you think he was referring
to
and I thought to myself corrupt
is there even one example of that
can you give me one example of something
Trump did that would fit the definition
of corrupt anything there are plenty of
things you could say you don't like
plenty of things you could even say he
might be impeachable for some of those
things but where was the corrupt part
well
where so so Jim gave some examples I
missed this part but I think he
mentioned Trump University
here's my take on Trump University
none of that sounded good to me
I've I've never once you know defended
anything about Trump University
but didn't we know that whole story
before the election
that was before the election
so in my opinion it was probably a
licensing deal where Trump lent his name
and didn't really know exactly what was
going on
he had 400 businesses with his name on
it he licenses the name
probably checks once when he makes the
deal you know is this legitimate makes a
deal I don't think he was auditing the
classes or looking at the materials
so yes
Trump is fully responsible for that and
paid for it but that was all that was
all known before the election
it had nothing to do with the election
and it was just a bad I would say a bad
licensing deal generally speaking
but what did he do as president
once Trump was president what would be
the example of the corruption so
Gaffigan gives this example that Jared
Kushner
got a two billion dollar contract after
Trump left office from the Middle East
do you think that's a real story
do you believe that Jared Kushner got a
two billion dollar contract how many
think that that actually happened in the
real world
does anybody think that's a real thing
no that's not a real thing
is there a two billion dollar story
about Jared Kushner yes
do you know what the story is
that Jared Kushner as a investment fund
and that the Saudi you know the big
National Fund Saudi Arabia has a sort of
a a whole country fund of money that
they invest and two billion of that was
directed to Jared kushner's new fund
they didn't give the money to Jared
Kushner
I think people who don't know much about
business imagine somebody wrote him a
check
well you think you just deposited it and
now he's living on his two billion
dollars
that's not what that is
he's managing a fund it's not his money
other people give him money to manage
he hires people to help them manage the
fund now uh well I'm going to get to
still Shady so let me be clear if you're
saying to yourself that's still Shady
I'm on the same page same page but let's
just continue talking about it
did you know that the Crown Prince of
Saudi Arabia is a good close personal
friend of Jared Kushner and it was the
prince who made that happen
right how many of you knew that they're
actually they're close personal friends
do you think that being close personal
friends I think it probably happened
during the Middle East negotiations
during Trump I assume that's when that
happened how often how how weird is it
or unusual
that somebody would want to invest with
their close personal friend
who actually could make them a lot of
money too
is that unusual
that's like the most common thing in the
world isn't it that people who know
people well are more likely to go into
business now
the big question is this
do you know the the Jared Kushner thing
was fully transparent
was announced publicly and there's no
there's no hidden elements nobody is
even accusing anybody of hiding anything
it's just right there
now are you comfortable
are you comfortable knowing that
somebody that connected to the power
structure in the United States is not
only good friends with the head of Saudi
Arabia but even they have a big
investment
that he's managing does that give you a
problem
I don't know that that makes the country
less safe
doesn't that make us more safe
doesn't doesn't that make the Saudi
Arabia far more likely
to remain our Ally of sorts and Are we
more likely to be their Ally of sorts if
we have
you know big connections and those
connections are working well for
everybody
if you were if you were the Crown Prince
of Saudi Arabia
and you wanted to put two billion
dollars into something that would
probably make money but also might have
a strategic political advantage
can you think of anything better than
putting money into a Jared Kushner fund
don't you think Jared Kushner has really
good access to Deals and people who can
manage the fund you don't think you
would have like the best access in the
world
to basically everything
that's exactly what I'd want in my
managed fund
so should you feel uncomfortable as
somebody that attached to the Trump
White House and and still attached by
family right because Ivanka
to drop so that attached has that big a
deal that looks like you could argue is
sweetheartish
but his sweetheartish in a in the most
transparent way
yes Saudi Arabia likes America
today
uh not so much under Biden and uh yes
they know each other personally and yes
publicly we've just announced this big
deal
now I'm not comfortable with it how many
of you would agree
I'm not comfortable with that
that that's a little it's a little too
much connection but it's also completely
legal
it was announced when it happened and
it's completely transparent and it's
also ordinary business
but I'm uncomfortable with it
how many would agree with that
assessment
that it's all legal it's all transparent
but I'm a little uncomfortable with it
and if you were to if you were to factor
that into any of your decisions I would
say that's fair
I'll give you that if you think that
that discomfort which is real
gives you some pause
I think it's entirely possible that
Jared was not expecting Trump to have a
second term I mean I can't read his mind
but he may have thought this will never
have any impact on anything in politics
this is just you know me using my
current situation in the world
to build business that makes everybody
some money in all likelihood
but now it's very you know it's kind of
awkward now isn't it
so I'll give you that I'll give you that
it's awkward but do you compare that to
the uh Biden crime family
do you think those are comparable the
the fact that 2 billion is a much larger
amount of money doesn't seem too
relevant
to the comparison because one is a
hundred percent legal and transparent
and probably everybody will make money
and the other one is completely sketchy
from top to bottom and the opposite of
transparent
those are not comparable
but the I think the Jim Gaffigan story
if if you think it's about Jim Gaffigan
I would say that's totally unfair
the the little bit I know about Jim
because I did get to spend some time
talking to him and I think this context
is completely useful
when when I spend I don't know probably
an hour just talking to Jim Gaffigan
about politics he listened to everything
I said
that was sort of the I would say the
Trump framing of the world
and he asked good questions
and he you know told me what he thought
about some things and I gave him you
know my context on those things and I
would say that the entire conversation
was 100 respectful
curious and genuine
he has a genuine interest in politics
he's genuinely curious he's genuinely
paying attention and when I talked to
him with a completely alternative view
of the world he listened intently
and we had just a good conversation that
was it now I didn't get the sense of
changing his mind anything that wasn't
really anybody's intention
but we had an exchange in which he was
fully open and at no point did he say oh
you crazy white supremacist or anything
like that he was just listening to
another citizen who had a little
different information and view of things
he Incorporated it and that's all I ask
so if you're if you're giving him
trouble I think you're directing your
fire in completely the wrong place
I see him and I hate to say this but he
looks like a victim of the news
and I do think there are victims
and there may be victims on both sides I
don't know if it's just on the left but
when you hear somebody say that Trump
was the most corrupt president and
there's literally not an example of
anything that happened in office
anything
there are things you don't like but none
of them go toward corruption at all he's
the most he's the most checked out
president of all time so that is such a
big point
such a big Point how how could you
possibly have the right opinion on the
Biden crime family alleged activities
if you thought that Trump was way worse
that would change everything about how
you saw that situation
but it just isn't based on any facts
so I'd give Jim Gaffigan a break on that
but it was fascinating
um I loved I mean I loved the
interaction wouldn't you love to see
more of that
wouldn't you love to see a Joe Rogan or
just somebody who can explain some
something clearly incredibly
now one of the things that Joe Rogan has
going for him is that nobody thinks he's
lying
isn't that like a superpower
think about how few people can fit into
that situation
if I I'll just name some names of my
favorites right these are just some of
my favorites if Thomas Massey tweets
something
it might be it might be accurate or
inaccurate you know because anybody can
be accurate inaccurate but he's never
lying
like I'm sure of it I I don't think he
has it I just don't think he has any
incentive is just nothing in his
character that would
cause him to just lie about something
right and I think there are there are a
few people in that same category I think
Joe Rogan is very comfortably in the
category where he has no incentive to
lie
he has no history of ever doing it and
nobody's even accusing him of it
how useful is that
think about what an asset that is
now would you say the same pick your
favorite pick your favorite News host
pick your favorite one from Fox or your
favorite one from another place how many
of them can you say well they might be
wrong but I know they didn't lie about
anything
right now I'll give you Gutfeld as
someone is best of my knowledge I've
never seen anything to even slightly
looked like he was trying to lie about
anything not once Tucker probably the
same thing but you could you might be
able to come up with some names on on
both the left and the right who you say
to yourself you know I'm not sure
they're always telling you the truth as
they see it but summer definitely yeah I
think Bungie you know tells you the
truth every time yeah
so
there should be some kind of accounting
for the fact that some people are
believable by almost everybody
and that that's got to be worth
something
don't you think
yeah I think if you were sort of a
casual Observer or politics imagine how
useful it would be to know the list of
people who could be wrong
and they might even disagree with you on
priorities and stuff like that
but they're never lying to you
wouldn't you love to have that list
I'll put I'll put Joe Rogan at the top
of my list
might disagree with them
never lied in fact I'll put Jim Gaffigan
on the same list
Jim Gaffigan might disagree with him I
do
he might have wrong information in some
cases
but I don't think there's any indication
he's ever lied to anybody
right would you agree there's no
indication he's ever lied
so he probably is just getting different
news and that should be the end of the
story so I don't like to see individuals
get attacked for something that's
clearly just part of the system
smirk Amish I think he's very honest as
well yeah no indication he's ever lied
about anything
all right
do you remember my prediction that AI
might run into a legal buzzsaw and that
you think AI is going to take over the
world but you haven't met a lawyer yet
because lawyers like to
stop things from happening
so sure enough
AI is you know the lawsuits are starting
to come because AI scours the
intellectual property of people like me
and then can create art based on our
arts and some say that's copyright and
that's bad and that's illegal now I
don't know what is and what isn't true
or legal and I don't know where it's
going to shake out and I'm not even sure
where I should shake out I don't even
know what's best for the world I don't
even know if the world is better off
with or without copyright in the world
of AI I don't know
I guess we'll figure it out
I know it's bad for the artists in the
short run
so but that doesn't mean it's bad for
the world Sometimes some Industries
have some uncomfortable changes or it
might be one of them
but
um
now there's reports so the Wall Street
journal's got a big piece that is
essentially confirming my prediction
did anybody else make that prediction
did you hear anybody else say
AI might be kneecapped by copyright
was I the first one you heard I think I
was the first one maybe you are not not
the first one in the world
Jack posabix said it
all right he's usually early on stuff
all right uh good news more good news
for you do you like good news everybody
I know you like good news so here's some
good news if you were worried about
vague and miscellaneous problems in this
country you don't have to worry anymore
because we had a lot of people who are
already working on the specific problems
so for example we have you know people
working on what do you do about Ukraine
and you know what do you do about the
Border we're not happy with the results
but but we had people working on those
projects but there were that left a lot
of stuff that nobody was working on but
the good news is that vice president
Kamala Harris is uh really leaning into
fighting against uh
miscellaneous miscellaneous things such
as things that would reduce your
freedoms and your rights
so if you're worried about losing your
miscellaneous freedoms and rights in
places that I don't know I'm not sure
what categories but sort of the
miscellaneous freedoms and rights and
she says she's fighting for you every
day
so if you woke up today and you said
I feel like I have most of my rights
yeah I have most of my rights but I'm a
little bit concerned about the
miscellaneous stuff
can you be more specific no just
miscellaneous rights and freedoms I'm
losing my miscellaneous Rights and
Freedoms
Kamala Harris is fighting to get them
back for you and I think she's doing a
good job because can any of you
did any of you had a problem with your
miscellaneous rights today
anybody
did anybody try to go to work and you
just couldn't
because you were lacking some
miscellaneous rights yeah she's got the
miscellaneous rights
taken care of so
that's good
all right question for you
um I need to fact check on this
fact check number one
did BlackRock recently say they were
going to buy a lot of Bitcoin did that
happen
I saw that in the news I didn't have
time to check just before I went live
can anybody confirm did BlackRock go
heavy into Bitcoin
somebody says yes all right so some
people say yes
now I'm just I'm just going to point out
the timing
apparently the Department of Justice I
think it was or whoever it was said
coinbase which is a big exchange that
has all kinds of cryptocurrencies you
can trade one for the other
uh says they have to get rid of
everything except Bitcoin
did that happen
did coinbase somebody told coinbase that
the the SEC was it was the SEC right
so the SEC said that all crypto is bad
except Bitcoin
and did this happen right after
BlackRock
loaded up on bitcoin
does that seem like a coincidence
and what what's Bitcoin doing right now
does that go up or down
uh bitcoin's up
point and a half all right bitcoin's up
so isn't that a little suspicious to you
that you worry that BlackRock is really
running everything because they own so
much of everything and they have so much
money and then you're saying Bitcoin
isn't up
I was looking at a stock a Bitcoin stock
is up how could they How could a stock
that holds nothing but Bitcoin be up if
bitcoin's down
or is it moving quickly maybe it's just
quickly up and down I haven't seen the
change yet
Bitcoin is flat interesting it's flat
but the fund that owns only Bitcoin is
up
okay I have some questions about how
that could work but maybe maybe
so I don't know what's happening with
crypto but looks like there's a
Direction that's formed
um
all right
I'm almost positive there's something
else I was going to talk about that
somehow I didn't oh
um
do you think Hunter Biden is lucky
or a skilled
is Hunter Biden lucky or skilled because
I'm going to point out one thing that
was really lucky
so if I were to ask you you know what
kind of skills do you have in life
you might say oh I'm good at pickleball
and I'm good at flower arranging and
stuff like that but if you notice that
most of the most of your hobby things
you're good at don't have any economic
value
right you're like oh yeah I I can trim a
bush like crazy I'm so good with my lawn
care but you know you're not a lawn care
professional so it doesn't really help
you so yeah I would say you're all
unlucky right you're unlucky
because you have a set of skills they
just don't line up with something that's
going to make a lot of money very
unlucky but imagine you're a hunter bite
and you happen to coincidentally you're
you know you're a trained lawyer
but coincidentally you're also a
world-class painter an artist
and isn't it lucky
that painting pictures which could be
valued at millions or zero very
subjective isn't it sort of Lucky of all
the skills you could have in the world
he got the one kind of skill
that matches perfectly a money
laundering uh
scheme for influence
isn't that lucky
just the only Talent he had
what was that one suppose he had only
been talented as a Cartoonist
I suppose he could draw really good
cartoons what what is the top Market
for a well-drawn comic
that's fresh you know not not something
that's historical oh I'd say hundreds of
dollars yeah I I could sell uh you know
before I got canceled I could sell an
original Dilbert art for uh
two to four hundred dollars
that would that be sort of the market
for that
so isn't it lucky
that his specific art was in the
category that's highly monetizable you
know if he'd been a cartoonist I don't
know he wouldn't make much money if he'd
been a figure skater or a uh if you had
a if you had let's say athletic skills
well he'd be too old so that wouldn't be
useful what if he had great musical
ability
well if he had great musical ability
he would only make as much as people
were willing to listen to it
so you couldn't hide anything in that
case because people would either buy it
because they wanted to hear it or not
you know nobody would be buying a
million dollars worth of his albums
so music even if he had this great skill
it'd be hard to monetize it
but of all the skills you could have in
the entire world
lucky lucky
Hunter Biden got the one skill
that could make you millions of dollars
without anybody being entirely sure
it was worth it
it's hard to imagine a luckier situation
than that lucky lucky anyway I saw Mike
kusernovich tweeted one of my tweets on
this topic and uh he was sort of
castigating himself for not realizing
that the question should be
has anybody ever seen Hunter make a
painting
I think there's a video of him using a
straw
to like blow paint on a like a modern
art piece
now let me ask you this
if you were going to pretend you could
make art
but you couldn't make art
would you pretend it with a brush
which would be really hard to fake
or would you pretend it by bro blowing
some paint through a straw
on a painting that was largely already
done
so you could see that if somebody added
like a little you know blow on the straw
you know it would sit with the
composition
it's kind of interesting isn't it
another coincidence another coincidence
that the only video or maybe it's only
just a photo is the only thing an artist
who works at a let's say a world-class
Art Level as he allegedly does it's the
only thing that you could do
if you were him
he picked the only thing that you could
have done
suck some paint into a straw and blow it
without thinking too much about what
it's going to look like because the
randomness is the art it's the only
thing you could have done too
interesting
aren't you a little bit suspicious
if he can if he can paint
I mean as well as the paintings look
because the paintings he produced to me
look like really good paintings
to me it looks like he has skill or
whoever is painting it as skill if you
know what I mean
all right
uh is very story I missed I think I
covered the synchronized whales
Hunter's amazing talents uh
Joe Biden not possibly going to be the
next president
where's mayor Pete
Scott you have bad taste in Earth no
offense no I wouldn't put any of it on
my wall
um I'm saying that as a objective
objectively it looks like good art
it honestly does
no joke it looks like
the paintings are done by somebody who
knows how to do art really well
um
the other thing I look for is if Hunter
draws any uh if Hunter makes any
paintings that involve real people
count the number of fingers
that just a little suggestion
the first time the Hunter produces art
with a human in it just count the number
of fingers you know what I mean wait
wait
and I don't mean because it's pregosian
that's a different story
imagine a VP debate between Kamala
Harris and Vivek
oh that would be too good
that alone is a reason to have
Vivek as a VP on the ticket if he
doesn't get the top spot
yeah
uh does a rising stock market and no
recession get Biden reelected
I doubt it
I don't feel like people think that
Biden did anything that makes a
difference to the economy do you think
they do I mean I realize it's tradition
to give credit to the president whether
it goes up or down right so it's
tradition that the president gets the
blame and the credit even when they
don't do anything but I feel like Biden
more than other people did less
you know when Trump when Trump was
President you know he would loosen up
energy regulations and then a whole
bunch of energy stuff happens and then
he says look at this energy stuff it's
part of the reason the economy is doing
well and you say to yourself huh well
that does sound like that would have
made a difference or if he says I
negotiated this or dropped out of this
treaty or this you say oh I don't really
understand that but it sounds like that
would make a difference but what did
Biden do that makes a difference he did
the infrastructure bill that nobody can
think of any impact to add on their life
so he's got a conceptual problem
and I don't think the economy will
improve enough that inflation won't
still hurt
I don't think the stock market is going
to make people feel good about inflation
because most people don't own stock
right most people most people are living
paycheck to paycheck if if that
yeah so I don't think the economy is
going to work
I think that Trump will be able to point
to a number of things that Biden did
that would be objectively and obviously
bad for the economy
maybe arguably they would be good for
the environment that would be the reason
he did some of them but I think Trump
can make the case it's bad for the
economy and then people will go okay
that's all I want to hear
all right
um did I say Matt McConaughey's
interview on this week now you know what
no offense to Matthew McConaughey
who I enjoy very much in movies
I hate listening to him talk about
anything that's not a line written in a
movie
although if it's his you know if he's
just talking about himself he's also
entertaining but when he talks about
politics
I just get the cringe attack of all
cringe attacks because I'm sure he
doesn't understand the topics
I'm sure he doesn't understand the
topics now to his credit I'm sure he's
looked into it more than the average
Hollywood actor but he's nowhere near
the level that any of you are
right almost any one of you can sit down
with Matthew McConaughey and teach him
things he'd never heard
I'm sure of it
but because he's got that you know
Hollywood actor Vibe he he sells his
sincerity
in a way that looks like acting to me
you know what I mean he looks like he's
playing an actor who's pretending to be
sincere he doesn't look like
a real person to me
I don't think
yeah so
I I just can't listen to him to him when
he does his commercials or when he talks
about politics he's just hard to listen
to
but I think he's an awesome guy I think
he's a good American glad he's
interested glad he's interested in
politics certainly welcome him to you
know be completely involved as much as
he likes
but just find him hard to listen to
all right but a good guy
um
all right anything else
are there any topics I've been missing
did you all enjoy finding out about the
UFOs
I feel like the UFO thing
um was a turning point
I feel like much of the country looked
at the UFO thing and they said
oh I get it the news is no longer even
trying
they're not really even trying to sell
like real news anymore they're just
basically I think the UFO story
made the difference between
um you know a tabloid makeup story
thing from you know the 60s or whenever
the tabloids started to you know today
all right
yeah it does seem to me like people's
minds were changed by that just I feel
it I just feel like people finally
understood
that the stories are almost all made up
in the news the news is almost all made
up
oh
yeah yeah it was a good way to sell
commercials I guess
um everybody keeps telling me I should
watch Tucker and Ice Cube and I've been
resisting it you know why
I just don't think it's news that two
smart people got along
i i people are acting amazed wow
Tucker like had a lot in common and
really really got along with this guy
who you imagine would be you know very
different from him would you like to
know a secret of the universe
that in person most people get along
the the amazing thing would be if they
didn't get along
that would have been the amazing thing
the fact that they had some things in
common about Freedom basically
that's not a surprise I just didn't feel
I needed to see it I'm sure it was good
entertainment but I I just watching two
reasonable people agree with each other
is not what I call entertainment
that should be everybody all the time
uh honestly if I have if I have a
conversation about politics
with somebody who's just a reasonable
and smart person
it never goes wrong
the only time he did was during the
height of TDS when people actually
couldn't have a regular conversation
they were just too flipped out
then you couldn't talk to anybody but it
but in a normal situation I think we're
I think we're close to normal at the
moment if you think about it I would say
that the TDs is the lowest it's ever
been
is still high but it's the Lois has ever
been
and at this moment I think you could
have a civil conversation with anybody
about politics no matter where you came
from
I mean I'm I'm literally canceled
you don't think I could sit down with
you know The Breakfast Club
or you know any black Americans and have
like just a great conversation in which
we largely agree on stuff
wait what we would mostly agree
you think that's not true
you're totally wrong
you're totally you could put me in any
environment
on a one-on-one in-person situation it
would go fine
every time
because I don't say things that are
crazy
do I do I think do I say things that
would trigger people
no I mean when I don't know for sure I
do what Joe Rogan did
I love Joe Rogan's discussion of Ray
apps
he simply said what we know and what we
don't know
and you have to leave it at that
that's the only respectful way to to
treat a fellow citizen who might in fact
be completely innocent of everything
raps you say what you know and what you
don't know and you gotta stop at that
and he stopped exactly at that
he gave the context he gave him the
facts and he stopped right there that's
that's as good as you can get
discussing politics or anything in the
news the best you can do is to say what
you know and what you don't know and
just let it lay there
all right
Hollywood nightclub guy was stomped to
death by a crowd I didn't see that story
um some liberals can't admit being wrong
oh that's not fair
is that fair
some liberals can't admit to being wrong
well you're acting like that's a problem
on one side you don't think that's
exactly the same problem on both sides
do you think that's something that only
liberals have because you'd be totally
wrong about that
cognitive dissonance does not go by
party affiliation
it doesn't go by intelligence you you
are not protected from cognitive
dissonance by intelligence
information
party affiliation training
credentials expertise
almost none of them help
it's a cognitive distance wouldn't even
exist if you could reason your way past
it
all right
uh
I told a friend I'm a trump donation
almost fell on the floor laughing saying
I still don't get it
foreign
so he had a friend fall on the floor
laughing because she gave Trump a a
political donation
well that's somebody who's having some
probably some problems
um
but I would support your friend if your
friend was simply uh reacting to the
fact that giving money to politicians is
a bad idea
I'm not big on donating to politics
I feel like if a politician needs my
money to win they're doing something
wrong
right yeah I wouldn't no I wouldn't I
would not donate to Vivek or anybody
else now donating I I think donating
made sense before social media
all right
Vivek is proving as is RFK Jr they're
both proven and trump-proofly before you
can get all the free attention you want
there's no limit to how much free
attention you can get
now Vivek probably doesn't have the
funding that he could say pay for a big
rally because rallies must be really
expensive you gotta rent the venue and
security and all that so but does he
need it
I mean that happens to be a thing that
works really well for Trump but Vivek
doesn't need that he's doing great on
you know earned media so
I just don't believe in giving money to
politicians
I just think they should do it without
any money
if you can't do it without any money you
probably shouldn't be running things
where money is involved
now if you have money you should spend
it right Trump can get money
you should absolutely spend it in smart
ways but if you don't I don't want to
hold that against you
yeah it's other people's money
uh
uh all right ladies and gentlemen I
think we've done what we can do for
today and I will talk to you
um
talk to you tomorrow bye for now you
