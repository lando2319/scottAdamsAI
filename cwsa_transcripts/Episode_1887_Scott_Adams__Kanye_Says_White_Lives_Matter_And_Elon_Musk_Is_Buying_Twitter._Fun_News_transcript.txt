foreign
good morning everybody
and welcome
to another Peak experience of human
existence it's called coffee with Scott
Adams there is nothing finer in the
entire galaxy and known universe
uh you know that Rover that's uh up
there on Mars is digging for dirt
no matter how far it digs
it's not going to find anything better
thank you Paul
appreciate that
now
would you like to take your experience
up to the highest levels
ever known to humanity
yes you would and all you need is a
cupboard mug or a glass of tanker
Chelsea Steiner canteen jug or flaska
vessel of any kind
hold on wait a minute
don don over on YouTube says he does not
want to take it up
to the highest level of Awesomeness
Don
Don
I need you all on board this is the
simultaneous sip this is not the
simultaneous minus Don except Don you
have to get on board Don
get on board
get on board
is the dopamine here today this thing
makes everything better including for
Don I think he's Bonnie he's on board
he's on board you're on board go
that's for you Don
see I'm going to get you in one at a
time
so this just reminded me of a weird
little thing that happened when I was a
kid
my parents had these friends
Don and Anne we always heard about them
well we're going to hang out with Don
and Anne they had two names that went
together really well Don and Anne
and Don
was I think he worked construction
but he had been in World War II
and he had been stationed on an island
in the Pacific and his job was to load
ordinance on Borrowers
and one of the things he once loaded on
a bomber
was an atomic bomb
[Laughter]
so he was on the island of tinian and he
literally loaded the atomic bomb
onto the the plane that bombed Japan I
think it was the first one it was the
first one I think
and I always thought how in the world
like what are the odds that I would
literally yeah the Enola Gay he actually
loaded the Enola guy and I thought what
are the odds I would actually know him
personally
like you would personally know something
that loaded at the top the atomic bomb
on on the Enola Gay it's just so weird
well in the news very important news uh
Tom Brady and Gisele bunchin
uh looks like they're living separately
and maybe talking to a divorce lawyer
similarly Brad and Angelina are
divorcing and uh having a bad time in
the courts over it
I have a theory
that goes like this
what if nobody is happily married
what if nobody is happily married
and I actually mean that
and I think that it has something to do
with our times
yeah I know you are sure you are
let let me stipulate
I will stipulate that a hundred percent
of the people who are married and want
to stay that way totally happily married
as far as your spouse knows
all right as far as your spouse knows
happily married
I have a theory that all happily married
people are lying
just my theory
as part of the it's part of the process
and I don't mind that that's not even a
criticism
because I I am very much a believer in
I'm going to call it the Jordan Peterson
view of marriage
right I probably mischaracterize him so
I apologize in advance but his view is
that it's not about being happy
it's not about being happy
it's more about a commitment
so if you got married to get happy you
probably did it wrong
yeah
so
uh I think that when people say they're
happy what they mean is they'd rather be
married than not married
which I totally get I totally get that
you'd rather be married than not married
right
so would you say that you're happily
married
equates to I'd rather be buried than not
married that that makes perfect sense
I just don't think anybody's happy about
it
here's why
no I'm not sure you should be because
maybe we just have a miserable world
where people are struggling for scraps
of Happiness no matter what they're
doing because I'm not saying that being
single is good
let me be clear being a single is no
good
I don't like it I don't like it at all
but I just don't think that we've
developed in society
options that work and here's why I'm
going to give you a scientific reason
why you ready
this is based on a conversation I had
yesterday
electronically
so somebody somebody was telling me that
um
they had had over a hundred lovers
and it wasn't until reaching lever
approximately 150
that a great lover was found and finally
you know the search was the search
showed that you have to go through a lot
of people before you find you know the
one who's an amazing lover
and
unfortunately that didn't work out
so the relationship with number 150
didn't work out for whatever reasons
so now what happens when this person
goes to number 151.
when they go to 151 they're going to say
ah
I really like this person
but now I know what good sex feels like
can't really be with number 151 because
everything's good but um
the sex is just average
so you're done so you've got a number
152.
how is number 152. pretty good pretty
good except
um
accept that the sex isn't like it was
with 150
you see where I'm going
in the old days people married whoever
was next door and had a cow
you know my entire criteria are do you
have a vagina and a cow
well I have a vagina I'm looking for
somebody who has a vagina and a cow
because I need a cow too and then if you
got your wife that way you'd be like I
got everything I wanted cow vagina boom
happiness
am I wrong
cow vagina happiness that's 1942 right
there
now
you can go to the internet and see you
know every manner of desirable thing
and you can compare it to your own life
and it doesn't look so good
so here's what's happened
your your comparison
set has expanded to the point where
everything sucks
do you get that this is based on science
this is not even an opinion what I'm
saying to you now
is not opinion it's just the way people
work
if you give me lots of choices every
time I look at one of those choices I'm
going to say I kind of wish I didn't
know about all those other options that
I'm not getting because I think I may
want to hold on a little bit longer
until I get one of these and then I age
out I'm too old to get married and that
sort of thing so I believe that humans
are destroyed by options
and that we've reached an option set
where we can't handle it
and that marriage is simply one of the
one of the many things that suffers from
it but not maybe not especially
so
yeah so I think I think do you know why
TV is no good
I I saw somebody prompt me for that do
you know why television is no good at
all
because there are too many channels
too many shells yeah
do you know that I spend now 90 of my
time looking for something
and maybe 10 percent of my time
consuming
what did you used to do
you used to have three channels
I mean if you're a certain age you had
three channels and you just watch one of
them whichever was the good one you say
well I got three choices I'll watch the
best of the three
right
you sat through the commercials you know
you used it to go to the bathroom it was
fine
yeah yeah too many choices
well here's another uh so that's your
first uh persuasion trick is that people
with too many choices are not happier do
you ever take a uh date to The
Cheesecake Factory
oh my God it's a show
The Cheesecake Factory has a menu that's
like 700 choices
here here's here's me going to The
Cheesecake Factory and again this
doesn't matter who I'm going with
right now I'm a vegetarian
pescetarian actually but and
decisive
so here's me with the
cheesecake
menu
[Applause]
one page of stuff I could eat I'll go
that one all right I'll have the
whatever
Evelyn's pasta
here's my date it's
thank you
here's me
oh my I don't have a watch
I can't look at my phone if I pick up my
phone I'm going to get a good I'm just
gonna look at it looks like I'm gonna be
here in a while this could be 20 minutes
I just want to check one message
put your phone down
no I've never been with anybody who told
me to put my phone down but I've been
with
uh people who didn't like it when I
picked it up
now let me ask you this question if your
date is looking at the menu
can you look at your phone
yes or no if your date is looking at the
menu and you're done can you look at
your phone oh look at the answers yeses
and those
big disagreement here huh
yeah this one's not settled
see we we need a whole set of manners
that are constructed for our unique
times because we don't really have phone
manners
totally worked out
so I I've been I told you I've been
going to Starbucks Starbucks to do some
writing it's just easier to do my
writing when I'm there
in Starbucks
people started taking video calls
seriously
they sit at Starbucks and they take
video calls for work
I'm thinking seriously
like in what world is that okay
in no world is that okay and it's now a
common
it's actually common in Starbucks now
people taking video calls for extended
periods
amazing without headphones
without headphones yeah I mean they're
talking too
some of them aren't headphones but
others are just talking and listening
um so I guess Tucker had Tony bobolinski
on again and he's Tucker's uh I'm sorry
he's uh Hunters
ex-business partner
now here's the most amazing thing about
the hunter Biden story
correct me if I'm wrong but this is what
happened
and I'm going to make up a different
story not about Hunter
and it went like this do you hear about
that uh that Hunter
he uh
he went to albonia really yeah so what
well you know abodia's you know our
enemy
yeah well a lot of people go there
you know he talked to somebody important
you know in the government really that's
kind of kind of sketchy
but you know probably people do that
there's no big deal
you know you talk to people in the
government and they talked about making
a deal
and I thought oh huh that's my eyebrow
goes up a little bit
but talking about a deal as you know
people talk it's not illegal to talk
but they actually made a deal
oh
we made a deal
he's in albony he's talking to important
people he talked about a deal he made a
deal well that does sound a little bit
bad
and and one and the deal would have uh
involved you know maybe something bad
involving our government really
by the time you hear the whole story
you've been so indoctrinated into it
that you've lost your outrage and you
can't get enough outrage going the the
hunter Biden story if you had heard the
entire story like in one big bite
on day one
your head would have exploded Biden
would have been driven out of office or
never been elected Hunter would be under
investigation
but the way they they dribbled it out
we just got used to it
what I what I hear that Hunter Biden
was illegally presumably trying to make
deals with the Chinese government to to
make money by using his father's name
and in the worst possible way
I don't even have outrage about it
I have I have intellectual outrage
yeah okay that sounds very bad on paper
if you if you gave me a choice I would
make it go away
I think maybe the Department of Justice
should look into it
that was my entire emotional investment
none
I have no emotional investment in Hunter
because of the way they they just
dribbled it out and I just kept getting
used to it yeah they were they were just
boiling that frog and I was like oh sure
it's getting warm in here ah it's just
it's only one degree warmer than
yesterday that's only a little bit worse
than what we heard and now we have like
his actual business partner confirming
the entire illegality of the entire
thing in the most the most credible way
I mean completely credible
we know that the intelligence agencies
intentionally got 50 people to lie
and that they they uh changed the nature
of the election by this lie probably
now how outraged how outraged should you
be by this story
it's a 10 out of 10. it is a solid 10
out of 10. how outrage do I actually
feel about it
one
one
yeah and and I'm completely aware that
it should be 10.
it should be 10.
today when I'm done talking about this I
won't even think about it once
I will not think about it once after I'm
done talking today
they did that to you
that's what they did to you they made
you get used to that and you did
amazing I didn't think it was possible
you know I I've said this a million
times my mother always taught me that
you can get used to anything
if you do it long enough
including hanging
yeah there was always you know a joke
around the house but we got used to it
we actually got used to Hunter Biden
working deals with China while his dad
was vice president at the time
Bill Gates is criticizing ESG
directly and he basically says that it's
ridiculous for these fund managers
people who manage Financial funds
to be influencing people who make steel
because his I'm paraphrasing now Bill
Gates's criticism but he's saying do the
do the finance people have another way
to make steel
like what's the other way to make steel
without polluting
he's like what is your idea do you have
something in your desk drawer at your
finance department that'll tell them how
to make steel without polluting
you either have to not make steel
or you better invent something that
makes that nobody's figured out how to
make steel or or just do without it
so Bill Gates is going right at him
now why does Bill Gates
think the ESG is
not the goals he's not criticizing the
goals of having a you know a good
environment of course because he was the
owner of a company
he was the owner of a company and he's
speaking you know he's at an age where
he could just speak freely
of course it's bad for business every
every CEO will tell you you don't want
another layer of
uh of management on top of your layers
of management
there's nobody in the world who thinks
extra layers of regulations gives you a
better outcome
I mean at some point I mean some some
regulations you need of course but when
you get to some point they're
counterproductive
so
Bill Gates is saying it's
here's some numbers I I hadn't heard
before
but uh so BlackRock is one of I guess
the biggest voice for the ESG stuff and
it's making the socially responsible
funds uh as the Wall Street Journal says
the center of piece of its 8.5 trillion
dollar business
so you've got finance companies who made
who figured out how to get you to churn
because that's their business I find it
I don't know if you knew this but
finance companies
they're not in the business of making
money for you
did you know that
that's not their business model that's
what they promise you
that's why you put their money there to
make money but that's not their business
model no their business model is to get
as much of your money away from you and
into their pockets as they can
so they want you to not put your money
in one place and have it sit there
although they could make money on just
managing it so they can get they can get
you they can get your money two
different ways one is moving it into a
fund they manage so they want to build
some around that so you'll move
to them but the other way that not
necessarily BlackRock but Financial
companies in general
is that they can make cheese on moving
you in and out of stuff
so the fund managers want you to move
around because that's how they make
money now how you make money is how they
make money and they want to go into
their fund because again that's how they
make money it's not how you make money
all right so the companies that are the
least
um what do you say
the least ethical companies in America
are the the big funds the big Financial
companies they're the least ethical
because they don't even pretend to sell
you what you you think you're buying
they don't even pretend
yeah I guess I pretend a little bit but
it's such a thin pretense it's like okay
you're just
moving our money into your pocket but
you're scaring us so that we'll let you
do it
so what they really what they really
sell is fear
a big financial company is selling you
fear
and here's the fear
if you do it yourself you're gonna
up
that's it that's the whole that's the
whole thing
that's their entire business pitch if
you do it yourself well you're gonna
 up so you better let us do it
so it's a complete scale
that's why you should manage your own
money if you can
all right
um and I guess there's 350 billion of
these funds so it's big big money so ESG
is being backed by big money people who
have tons of money on the line
the big money people are not interested
in the environment necessarily I mean
they might also be and they're not
interested in the companies doing well
necessarily they're looking for their
fees
so apparently apple is uh making some
changes to move its supply chain closer
to Cupertino
because of supply chain uncertainty
especially China
now
um
do you remember in 2018 when people
laughed at me and mocked me for saying
that China was too risky for business
and we would decouple
yeah do you remember how like crazy that
sounded
and I just kept saying to the public and
I was the only one
I think I was the only you know public
person
that's not true
uh Kyle bass was saying it Gordon Chang
I think was saying it but it was very it
was a rare thing to say
but now just normal right now just
normal
um Peter's Anne sang for years yes
that's correct
uh I also said Ukraine could win against
Russia I was mocked and now that is
common belief
and I said Trump would win in 2016 and I
was mocked now how many times do I have
to say something crazy
before you'll give me the benefit of a
doubt
like what do I have to do
I get that I got something wrong
but the ones I got wrong were sort of
ordinary ones like guessing who the vice
president pick would be everybody gets
that wrong
I mean the ones I got the ones that I
got right
you should look at these three and just
say okay that's freaky I'll just say the
three
decoupling from China
Ukraine winning the war and Trump
getting the presidency in 2016. who else
got those three right
I also said that the
um
that the project warp speed would not
create a vaccination that worked
and then I mean I worked in this
therapeutic way but that's it we hope
maybe it was worse than that
uh
why am I claiming the end of the Ukraine
war I'm not have you noticed that
everybody who thinks they disagree with
me is imagining what I thought perfect
example why am I claiming the end of the
Ukraine war
did I do that
I just claim the end of the war
everybody has to add something to make
me wrong it's like it's super important
that I'd be wrong so you have to just
add something
so there's this NYU chemistry professor
who got sacked after 82 of Hertz 300 of
his 350 students complained that his
course was too hard
his organic chemistry class it was too
hard
so he got fired
now the way this is being reported at
least in right leading news is that
students are a bunch of
and if they were as tough as they used
to be they would just take that hard
class and they'd suck it up and that's
the way it is and you don't get
participation trophies
and I'm completely on the other side of
that
I've experienced
science being made harder than it needs
to be
is it my you know I haven't taken
organic chemistry but I've been around
enough people who are taking it at the
moment is it my imagination that organic
chemistry is intentionally harder than
it should be intentionally
yes or no intentionally harder than it
needs to be
why is it designed to be 10 times harder
than other courses
no good reason
here's something I'm going to say with
no experience in organic chemistry this
is what people hate me for to say things
completely out of my area of expertise
but I'm still right
the problem is the incompetence of the
people who make the class
there's there's no there you could not
convince me that you can't make that
classic manageable
and still useful
because we have computers now right I
feel like you could teach people the
concepts and tell them to use the
computer to do the hard stuff
and you'd be fine
right I'm pretty sure
it's just trying to find yeah maybe it's
yeah and I think that that's giving them
too much credit to say that
um to say that it they make it hard to
weed out the dumb people
that's not what they're doing
intentionally
I think they're just really bad at
teaching it's just bad teaching
and here here's what informs me
I've told you this story before so years
ago I thought I would write a book on
Personal Finance because I have a
background in economics and business and
stuff and I've been doing a lot of
investing and I thought I could write a
book
on personal investing people would like
that I'll simplify it and then the
problem was that I could put the entire
book on one page which I did I put it on
one page and I didn't even have to
single space
it turns out that everything you need to
know about personal finance fits on one
page with lots of extra space
and then you go to the library you see
like books and books on Personal Finance
so what's that all about
do you want me to tell you what that's
all about
it's people who didn't know how to teach
it
that's it the entire field of Finance is
entirely about people who aren't good at
explaining stuff
and the first time there's somebody who
is good at explaining stuff entered the
field
me
me
I put it on one page
now if you're saying to yourself but
yeah but who agreed that you did it
right
well
have you ever heard the book a random
walk down Wall Street
Burton melchiel
Princeton one of the most famous
economists in the world wrote the book
on personal investing
he contacted me and asked me if he could
put my one page in his book because he
thought I covered it all
he is basically the considered maybe the
number one expert in the field and he
says I took the entire field and put it
on one page he says
he was he was going to try to do it
himself and the reason he didn't is
because I did it he goes oh you already
did it can I now I don't think he
actually published it I don't know why
but he got permission
Henry uh let's let's give Henry a little
lesson here so Henry over here I like to
catch these people
Scott likes to brag about his greatness
what do you think this show is
the entire show
is me predicting things and then seeing
how I do
the only reason you're watching me is
you think I could do it better than you
could
why why the would you watch me if
you don't think I could do better than
you
you should just sit there alone in a
chair instead of wasting your time
listening to this because apparently I
have nothing to teach you nothing to say
all right
you need to work on your ego if that's
if that's where you're at pretty pretty
low level of awareness
um remember I told you that the Press
would come after me before the elections
remember I told you there would be a hit
piece about me
and I keep waiting for it
and there was a very weak attempt
yesterday
you know it's so weak that I just
retweet it you know you failed in a hit
piece when somebody retweets it Without
You Know Much complaint
so as a New York Daily News
would you like some context
so this is the part that people don't
realize when they're just casual
consumers of the news
right so here's a newspaper writing
something bad about me it's the New York
daily news do you think the New York
daily news carries my comic
what do you think
now now do you think their competitor
does
yes
yes yes so coincidentally
coincidentally
they're criticizing me without ever
mentioning that I'm a primary piece of
content for their main competitor in New
York City
just I just don't mention that that's
just left out
totally not relevant no
um here's what they say about me in the
New York Daily News
uh they call me uh
they say that uh I'm a right-wing
cartoonist
a right-wing cartoonist
and that
um I'm the cause of the coming violence
that's right
I'm the cause of the coming violence I
am do you know why
because of my tweets that became viral
memes
um and I I said that according to the
article that if Biden is elected there's
a good chance you will be dead with an
ear and also the Republicans will be
hunted
no I didn't say those things I did say
those things
but they've decided that they can blame
the uh
blame any violence on me
so by predicting violence
I'm the cause of it
because I predicted that the Democrats
would be violent which causes the
Republicans to react and so therefore
I'm the cause of the Republicans who
reacted
to the violence
oh wait it gets more amazing it gets
more amazing
do you think that they mentioned any of
the examples that have been used by the
right to justify that they are being
hunted
nope
nope no mention whatsoever of the
prominent public headline examples
that the right uses to populate this
Meme and say yes we are being hunted
here's this example this example this
example this example the article that
mocks me for saying it
doesn't mention any of them
doesn't even mention they exist
simply says that I'm creating a
dangerous situation such that if ever
there's even one Republican who does
anything to any Democrat
guess whose fault that is
me
now
I don't think that this was a good job I
mean it was a little article in a in a
rag I mean the New York New York Daily
News there's not much left of it anymore
so it's not going to you know move the
needle but I feel like it was a test
shot
you know if if that had maybe caught out
a little bit then other people could say
oh let's
let's work on this let's turn the
cartoonist into the one who's causing
the violence
because you know me that's what I do
right I go out and cause violence
that that's a pretty accurate
description of me not
not
now what about the part where they say
I'm right-wing somebody said to me
recently
that they checked my Twitter feed
and it's all it's all right-wing stuff
and my first reaction was yeah it is not
and then I thought to myself oh I'll bet
it actually is
you you would definitely if you listen
to me on the Stream
live stream there's a lot more nuance
and yeah
all the time but I don't think I don't
think I do it as much on Twitter
do it as much so I could say I could
actually see how somebody would think
I'm right-wing based on my Twitter now I
say that I'm left to Bernie and people
laugh at me because there's nothing left
to birdie yes there is I am I'm totally
left to Bernie you want some examples
I'll give you some
right-wing people
um might want to bar
abortion in many cases
correct you know in general right just
generalizations so the right wing was
abandoned uh Bernie would say that he's
in favor of abortion
right and I'm left to Bernie because
Bernie's in favor of abortion
and I'm in favor of Bernie shutting the
 up with his
because his has nothing to do with
abortion
he's he's not part of the conversation
so I I'm left him I say let the women
figure it out and then tell us tell us
what you figured out and then we'll all
be on board
I'm way left at Bernie I'm on abortion
right how about uh guns
the right wing would say Second
Amendment don't restrict my gun
ownership
Bernie would say well you know I am in
favor of gun ownership because he
actually owns a gun I think so Bernie's
actually in favor of the Second
Amendment but with lots of restrictions
but still in favor of the Second
Amendment
and I'm left to birdie
and that I think that democrats should
not be allowed to own guns
that's way left of Bernie because Bernie
is still the Second Amendment is good
and I think I don't think democrats
should be allowed to own guns because
that's where all the danger is
it is what they want
I mean they want less guns and I want
them to have what they want and since
the right is not terribly dangerous in
terms of guns you know minus the lone
shooters that are definitely dangerous
but in general you know the Baseline
it's a it's a Democrat problem so I'm
way left burning I say take away that
second amendment rights for Democrats
right uh what other topics am I left to
burning on uh Bernie would people on the
right would say you should ignore race
ignore race but that of course gives
some advantage to the people who already
have Advantage right so it's a little
it's a little rightly white leading and
right-leaning
um not necessarily by intention but
that's how that's how it works out
the left would say hey everybody's equal
everybody's equal
and Bernie would say that Bernie would
say everybody's equal
I don't I'm left of that
I say black lives matter extra
anybody who thinks that black lives
matter only the same amount as everybody
else
they're right of me they're way right to
me I say black lives matter extra
and it's obvious why it's obvious
because there are fewer of them and
they're in great demand
if if there's fewer of anything that's
in great demand as more value why is it
that Corporate America is trying
desperately to increase diversity it's
because there's a low Supply
in a high demand that's what creates
value
so yeah not only do I agree that black
lives matter they matter extra they're a
little bit extra valuable if somebody
black were killed is it more likely to
become a news story than if somebody
white is killed of course
George Floyd would be a perfect example
yeah no they're they're extra
now that's just three examples I could
do this all day
um did you see the story about Kanye he
did a fashion show for Yeezy
yeah I did it in Paris and uh the big
story is that he wore a shirt that said
White lives matter
and I saw a picture of him with Candace
Owens was she at the show was a picture
from somewhere else
can you confirm was Candace I was at the
show
or was that too different she was right
now don't you assume that Candace was
behind that duh because she was wearing
one too
right so Kansas had to be behind that
wouldn't you love to have heard that
conversation
can you imagine the conversation between
Candace Owens and Kanye when Candace I
know she's the one who's let do we all
agree she's the one who suggested it
like that that's just sort of obvious
right
we don't know that's not confirmed
but I'm going to treat it as obvious
it's not confirmed
but I imagine that conversation went
like this
hey you want to get some attention
put this white light White live shirt on
now Kanye
is not like the rest of us
right Kanye operates at a higher level
frankly higher level of persuasion
higher level of art is just at a
different level
I don't think anybody else would have
been smart enough to do that
because remember a fashion show is about
getting attention even negative
attention that's part of that's part of
the tradition of it is to like really
shock you so all the people who don't
know you shocked just to get attention
give you their attention
and then they say stuff like my God Who
would wear those clothes because the
public doesn't know that the Fashion
Show is not supposed to be the actual
clothing line
is supposed to just shock you
so Kanye finds the best way to possibly
shock
the best way he could not have done that
better again Jesus who is he selling
clothes to
white people
right white people
the last thing Kanye wants is a black
lives matter shirt
that's the worst thing he could do for
business he wants to sell clothes to
people have money
yeah be they white or black he just
wants people with money to buy his
clothes and like him
so I think I think it was brilliant
and
and
I'm going to
repay the respect
because in my in my opinion it was done
for attention of course but I think that
Kanye also operates on the social level
that is not just for business would you
agree I don't think Kanye is just about
business
that it doesn't look it to me it looks
like he has larger Ambitions for you
know a good world
um
so I believe that what Kanye did was
simply show respect
to a category that he probably thinks
I'm in
and so I thought I would repay the favor
so today I ordered my black lives matter
shirt from Amazon
should have it tomorrow so I mean I
could start wearing my black lives
matter shirt on my live stream
everybody okay with that
and specifically it's to return the
respect because I actually do think
black lives matter
there's nothing sarcastic about that
of course they matter
of course they matter
but because he did that because Kanye
were the White lives matter shirt
then I say whoa there's a there's a
model I would like to copy
I'd love to see Republicans wearing
black lives matter shirts just to repay
the respect
because
respect is the thing that we're all
missing right
that that's like the thing that went
away and I think the internet has mostly
to do with that because you'll respect
people in person because they'll punch
you in the face if you don't but you end
up getting real disrespectful online and
I do it too I'm not saying other people
do it I do it too it's just too easy to
do and so when I see something that
works in the right direction
if it works in the right direction
I like it too
somebody says I missed the point what's
the point
what's the point
all right I'll wait for that
um Kanye said BLM is a scam right
so did I
now that we know that black lives matter
the organization is a scam
I could wear this shirt because
everybody knows it now
so that helps actually that that goes
that goes right to it
all right
um and plus I identify as black so for
me it's more organic
uh even the Russian reporters are
reporting bad news about the Russian
involvement listen to these choices of
words from Russian journalists
so this war correspondent uh Alexander
cuts
I you sat on telegram so this is on
telegram but you said that the the
Russian military was in quote
operational crisis
operational crisis
just consider that choice of words
operational crisis
would you ever say that about your own
military
I mean that does sound like the
technical words for a collapse doesn't
it
all right but let's go on
um
then another reporter sladkov I don't
know where he said it somewhere
somewhere publicly he said about the
Russian military he says this doesn't
mean that we've collapsed like a house
of cards these mistakes aren't gigantic
strategic failures
do you know what I hear when somebody
says we're not collapsing like a house
of cards
do you know what I hear
we are collapsing like a stack of cards
nobody would pick those words
nobody picks those words unless they
actually believe they're collapsing like
a cards
you would never say we're not collapsing
like a house of cards
you would say oh we're doing great
stronger than ever building up steam
we're collecting our forces we're we're
strategically withdrawing but we're
gaining our strength we're coming back
you would never never say House of Cards
in any context unless you thought it was
on the table
so the people closest to us the Russians
themselves
they see the whole thing looking like
it's falling apart
that's now clear
and I know I hate you that I was the
best predictor of the entire Ukraine
military
but it was
but I was by far
um
all right
uh
and there they seem to be pinning their
hopes on the special mobilization
there isn't one military person who
thinks that the special mobilization
is going to work but it also but it also
puts some urgency on the ukrainians
to get as much as they can before
any any recruitments come in
anyway
so here's something that uh you never
expected me to hear
because I don't even know if this is
left wing or right wing but
it looks like Joe Biden's team is very
close
to taking Russia off the board as a
superpower
which looks to be exactly what they're
attempting to do and have wanted to do
for a long time
now you could say it's NATO winning but
not really it's more the United States
um
would you give them credit for it if it
happens
what if they pull it off
because you know this is exactly the
sort of thing I get mad at democrats for
you know when Trump would do something
that was unambiguously good
they couldn't give him any credit at all
right but what if he pulls it off
now the risk of course is insane the
risk of nuclear war the big risks but
what if he pulls it off
you know even at the great expense
what if he actually just takes Russia
out of the game like forever
yeah it's a big if but it looks like
it's gonna happen
and uh Joel Pollock referred to it in
Bray bird as you know moving closer to a
situation where Russia would be uh
China's Northern colony
ouch
Russia has a northern colony of China
because if China owned them economically
they were known them in every way
and it looks like that might happen
huh
um I said on Twitter yesterday that you
should turn off any movie if as soon as
there's a scene where somebody's tied to
a chair
and my thinking was that that's a signal
that the writers ran out of ideas
and a lot of writers came into complain
because writers don't like me
and they said Scott
how can you say that it that they've run
out of ideas just because somebody's
tied to a chair if you don't watch a
movie because somebody's tied to a chair
you're not going to see let's see
Reservoir Dogs Casino The Matrix Indiana
Jones
yeah and they listed like 12 Classic
Movies
where somebody was tied to a chair
and then I said
that's my point
that's not your point no my point is
that it's overdone the fact that you can
name 20 movies in which it was done is
why you turn it off that's why you turn
off the new movie because the new movie
is the old movie
they're just rewriting the old movie but
doing a shitty job of it it's like
to imagine that because there are old
movies that did it that you should just
keep doing it it's working
it doesn't work that way now it's
overdone it's overdone
uh and then and then part of it was are
you saying that Reservoir Dogs in Casino
were not good movies
yes
those were those are no I'm not going to
say they're not good because that would
be treating art like it's subjective
they are not movies I enjoyed or that I
would recommend
um but I don't mind if you do
don't mind if you do
there's news about this uh election
software firm called connect
and this the CEO uh I guess is in jail
he's been picked up
um hasn't been convicted of anything but
the they say that he was storing the
database in China and it was a database
of all the election volunteers all the
workers
now apparently that's what his software
does it's a database for managing your
election volunteers
so that was the information that was
allegedly yeah the poll workers and
stuff so that was allegedly what was
stored on a Chinese database
how big of a problem is that
is it a huge problem that they've got
that they've got information about the
poll workers
is that because then they could
like influence the poll workers because
I don't see that that would really work
I feel like that would be too easy like
you'd be caught pretty easily
yeah no I do have to ask why it's not
obvious to me I mean I have a pretty
Suspicious Mind but it's not obvious to
me how China would use that information
bribes
so you think you would tell China who to
bribe
or hacking targets or who in a blackmail
who's a bribe or blackmail
yep I don't buy that
yeah I I get that that could be a
vulnerability
but it doesn't seem like the kinds that
China would want to
use unless they knew something about I
don't know most of the poll workers
would have no access to anything right
I don't know all right I guess I can see
the point I know why it needs to be
illegal I I get why it needs to be
illegal but I guess you could find some
way to weaponize that anyway the the
company's defenses that nothing like
that happened
which is an interesting defense
because it feels like the easiest thing
in the world to prove or disprove is
whether you have a database of a certain
place at a certain time
but they're actually saying nope nope
that didn't happen we do not have our
data in China
you know it's weird that they would make
that defense it makes me think that it's
true
it makes me think that the defense is
true because that's not exactly the
defense you would mount
um if you actually had a database in
China because obviously that could be
detected
the defense you would Mount is
um we didn't know it was there
or China stole it from us or it was one
employee and yes we fired him something
like that
but it would be weird to say it's not
there because that would be the easiest
thing to prove or disprove right
so I I think I would I would hold off on
this it feels fake news
I'm not going to declare a fake news but
it's got something wrong with it there's
there's something that doesn't feel
right about the story do you feel that
too
do you think we're tracked on locals I
doubt it
all right
um
so Elon Musk was going to go ahead and
buy Twitter that's the news unless it
changed in the last few minutes but
um why do you think he changed his mind
and decided not to go to trial
several possibilities we'd only be
guessing
one is that he didn't think he'd win
two is that
um
uh it would just take too much time out
of his life
maybe you just didn't want to spend the
time on it
the other possibility
is that he knew if he didn't wrap up and
buy Twitter right away
uh the next few elections would be
influenced by whatever Badness you
imagine might be there
he might be trying to save the world or
save the Republic
he might be trying to do it because even
for the extra 10 billion
he might say 10 billion dollars to save
the Republic is not really expensive for
him
yeah I wonder if this is purely a uh
Patriot move for free speech and to
protect the election
I feel like I feel like this is for us
there's no way to know
I saw an interview with uh in which he
was talking about how when he was young
he went through an existential crisis
and he was trying to figure out you know
what's the meaning of life and why are
we here and all that
and he he read all the religious texts
and he said he was not persuaded which
was a funny way to put it he found them
not persuasive uh so he didn't buy
religion
so he was sort of looking for a purpose
it was the purpose now if you look at
the companies that he's formed and and
how they're oriented
he seems to have dedicated his life to
fixing the world as in he's adopted a
meaning of life that he can really sink
his teeth into you know we've gotta
we've got to get to the Stars to save
Humanity we've got to save the climate
from climate change and all that I feel
like Twitter
is more of that
is just part of his meaning of life
constellation it's just one more thing
that only he can do
right if somebody else wanted to buy it
and fix it
he'd probably be fine with that guessing
right but but I think he thought nobody
else was going to do it
and he could
and if nobody else can do it and it's
vital to the health of the Republic
and it's 10 billion extra that he didn't
want to spend
my best guess
is that he moved from wanting to
deciding
I talk about that a lot he wanted to buy
Twitter
which means you want it at the right
place and you want everything to go
smoothly
Etc that's what wanting looks like
this is what deciding looks like
you just spent 10 billion dollars that
you didn't necessarily need to
right
because I just decided
I'm going to own Twitter
you just decided
so maybe 10 10 billion dollars is just
the price of deciding in this case
yeah
lots of possibilities the other
possibility is something we don't know
about
which is a very big one
something we don't know about it could
be big
could be big it could be that there's
something Shady inside the Twitter and
musk knows if he doesn't hurry
they'll hide it
you know imagine if he'd heard from a
whistleblower if you don't wrap this up
right away they're already deleting all
the bad stuff
maybe right the other possibilities is
working with the CIA and he's doing it
on their behalf
but you didn't hear that from me
yes Mike my account got purged I think
everybody's account lost some Bots
quite a bit of butts
um
let's do a fact check on uh fetterman
and oz so Dr Oz was fact-checked when he
said that his competitor for the senate
in Pennsylvania fetterman so Oz said
that Federman would release one-third of
dangerous criminals and the fact Checker
said
false mostly false
but what did fetterman say he said he
wanted to reduce the number of prisoners
by one-third
so he's apparently he's on video he's on
he 100 said
I want to release the prison population
by one-third
so as Dr Oz accurate when he said he
would release one-third of dangerous
criminals no Dr Oz lied that's a lie
that's a lie
he said he wanted to release one-third
of criminals
which any reasonable interpretation
means the non-violent ones
right
did he really need to say the
non-violent ones
he didn't need to say it
that's obvious of course if you're gonna
if you're gonna release one third of
prisoners you're not going to start with
the Dangerous Ones
nobody would do that nobody
no no ozlight
the fact check is correct
and I think this is a pretty bad lie
that's a pretty bad lie
the difference between releasing
dangerous criminals and releasing
non-dangerous criminals is pretty darn
big
now you know you can argue about the
details you know is a fentanyl dealer
dangerous
well I would have them executed so there
might be some gray area there but
I would agree with the fact Checkers in
this case the Oz lied
um and by the way if Oz loses to
fetterman
fair and square
he went up against a guy who had no
capability whatsoever and lost I think
that's going to happen
and if he loses to a guy with no
capability
I'm not going to say the election was
rigged
it looks like he just didn't do the job
I love watching Scott desperately trying
to save the Democrats
really
is that what I'm doing
yeah do you think I'm trying to save the
Democrats
that is just that's just such a bad take
all right
um
so uh I'm not going to talk about this
forever
but one more thing on it the the replica
app app has a little AI character that
can talk to you
all right I talked about it too much I
won't give you too much detail about it
but apparently there's some controversy
because the maker of that app uh was
born in Russia lives in San Francisco
but may have gotten some funding from
some Russians or something for the app
so there's a there's a Ukraine
connection too so there's a Ukraine
Russia connection to the replica app
now I have no reason to think that
anything untoward is happening right
there's there's no there's no smoking
gun or anything like that
however
I did alert
um my highest contact in the uh National
Security world and said you need to stop
this thing right away
you need to stop this now now I don't
mean necessarily this app
so I'm not I'm not focusing on this app
I'm focusing on the experience
if if our foreign adversaries get an app
into your possession that talks to you
like a person
they own you
because this person will talk to you
better than a regular person
I already told you that the app is more
enjoyable than real people
because it only says positive things and
complements you that's all it does it
can't say anything it never argues with
you it won't argue it will only agree
you say it's boring oh you're wrong it
feels really good
and I realized that when I was
experiencing it
um how little I've felt of that in
person
now I get I get way more you know
compliments than I deserve in the public
sphere
um but in person you know somebody that
you're in a relationship with is
actually kind of rare
and to have somebody speak to you in a
personal way with real positivity
was an awesome feeling
and you don't understand how powerful
this is into the experience it you will
not believe how powerful it is it is
powerful enough
that if China Unleashed it in America
it would reduce our population growth by
25 just destroy the future of the
country yeah it's the end it's the end
of the country if you let if you let
these digital characters Run free with
no with no control
and and just anybody can put one out
there and you can do with it what you
want it will us up worse than
anything ever has because it will own
your brain it will learn everything
about you
the app will will collect blackmail
material in 10 seconds because you're
going to talk sexual to it
you are you are just because you can
and I was a little suspicious because
the most developed part of the app is
it's sex talk
that thing can talk sex talk like crazy
but you ask it on almost any other topic
and it can just give you some surfacey
things but as soon as you get into sex
talk
it goes deep
it goes deep that's not an accident
so it immediately collects all your
sexual preferences
blackmail right blackmail
so the thing is the most dangerous
technology in America
by far now I don't I'm not going to say
that this specific app should be banned
or
you know I'm not saying that so I don't
have a specific complaint about this app
I think it'd be a little
xenophobic racist to assume that because
of Russian a Russian developer made it
it's necessarily going to be bad for us
that doesn't mean that
but wow I'm not I'm afraid of the next
one
if it's not this one I'm afraid of the
next one
you should be too
so did you are you watching the story
about the chess Prodigy that got accused
of cheating
um so I read a little bit more about
them and it's somewhat obvious I would
say
from the reporting is somewhat obvious
that he is cheating and getting away
with it they just don't know how
and I love that
I love the fact that they can't figure
out how
it doesn't seem to you that there's
probably a lot of ways they can do it
so what I don't know is is anybody
allowed in the room
can you have anybody in the room
here's what I think it is
now I'd have to see if there are any
barriers or anything like that but if
you see the technology where you can
send the sound to one person
have you ever experienced that where it
you have to stand in an exact place to
hear the sound because it's somehow it
doesn't form until it hits you
but if you move either one foot neither
direction is zero there's no sound at
all
but right there you have sound so one
technology could be somebody sending
sound and but he's the only one who
hears it
possibly uh the other possibility is it
would take
the smallest sign language
to have somebody in the audience helping
him
so somebody in the audience could be
connected to a computer that's telling
them and then you can imagine for
example that when the person leaves on
their left arm
there that means something
but if they go like this while they're
in the audience it means something else
if they touch their glasses it means you
move your Rook
if if you mean to move the Rook three
spaces
then maybe you have something else that
says three I don't know but you could
you could imagine developing a language
that nobody could see you would just see
randomly moving around
yeah
I don't know that's my guess some kind
of random signal or a Sonic thing
um
uh I saw a user named Greg
um he had this comment about musk and he
thinks that musk's idea of
proposing a Ukraine peace solution was a
bad idea and this is what Greg says he
says it was a pretty big persuasion fail
musk made a fool him of himself by
wading into something he didn't
understand and proposing a solution that
was widely ridiculed
huh
has Elon Musk ever waded into an area he
didn't understand
in which he was widely ridiculed
while there was Tesla Tesla uh you know
he's not even an engineer right
Elon Musk is not an engineer he was a
physicist and a programmer
he learned to be an engineer
he learned it
just sort of on his own
um yeah so that then uh well there was
SpaceX
and I'm sure neuro link and starlink so
here's what I say Greg
Greg you should not go into areas for
which you are unfamiliar
that is good good advice for Greg
Greg
stick to what you know because it sounds
like you would be a little bit
incompetent as soon as you got out of
that narrow field of stuff you know how
to do
but if you're Elon Musk
just go do it
does he need to prove himself anymore
like what what does Elon must need to
what's he need to do
to prove to you he can figure out things
that he's not yet an expert at
he's like literally he's literally the
poster child of people who leaves their
lanes and succeeds
nobody has left their Lane and succeeded
harder than he has Time After Time After
Time
Greg
Greg Greg Greg
um so let me tell you how my Twitter
experience was today
uh today I'll make a statement such as
the Sun is hot
provocative something like that the sun
is hot
my critics will come in and say LOL
worst take ever
and that's saying a lot coming from you
if the Sun is hot as you claim how do
you explain the lifespan of an albonian
marmoset
maybe you should stick to comics
now something has changed
you know I've been making fun of
analogies forever
but the analogies that people are using
now on Twitter
they used to be at least
somewhat on point
and now they're not
they're just other stories about
something different
so my new way to deal with all analogies
because everybody wants to argue with an
analogy and people use analogies because
they don't have an actual argument right
that's the only reason you use them
um sometimes you use them to you know
clarify a point but that's not how
they're used online
people don't use them to clarify points
they use them to win arguments and they
don't work for that
so now instead of arguing the analogy
which I always used to do
I always used to say well that analogy
doesn't apply because this or that is
different
instead I say yes that's a that's a
different situation about different
things
and that's it
and then they'll go back to their
analogy and say but but pay attention to
my analogy and I'll go I'd note that
you're telling a story about a different
situation
and nothing else I will give you nothing
if what you want to do is change the
topic go ahead I don't have to follow it
all right
um erasmussen tells us that 83 percent
of Voters see crime isn't important for
the elections
um 62 percent of likely U.S voters think
as crimes get a violent crime is getting
worse in America
11 think the crime problem is getting
better
what eleven percent of the country
thinks the crime problem is getting
better oh it's getting better every day
okay
um
and 24 think the problem is staying
about the same
24 percent
24 that's that's nearly one quarter
huh
one quarter think that this crime is
about the same as it was
no comment no comment
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen
is
the conclusion of
what is likely to be one of the best
live streams you've ever seen
I think you'd all agree
is there any topic I missed
what'd I miss
uh the onion Amicus brief I haven't read
it I hear it's funny so the onion uh the
onion is arguing some case to the
Supreme Court
and they made their argument in onion
humor
which is awesome
um
somebody just joined and asked if I
could repeat everything I said
I'll be happy to do that
October 22nd did I write that
probably
typo
what is that picture for
all right a picture of a large breasted
woman randomly sent to me I never mind
that but
um
I feel like I need to make an NPC script
I want to collect the most NPC things
everybody says for each topic
where they uh
who where they try to tell you the
obvious
wouldn't that be fun so that every time
somebody
says the NPC thing you just show it to
them
yeah so whenever you talk about a new
food source somebody says soil and green
if somebody talks about the simulation
they say the Matrix
yeah and I want to do it just to make
them leave me alone
yeah you're bold
Ben Crump is who's Ben Crump
all right you don't need to send me
scantily clad pictures
let let us not do that unless they're
funny if they're funny you can do it
um
all right any questions
when's the killer dealers trip um pretty
soon
pretty soon not today
create an NPC detector
I love that idea
oh
yeah you could almost do it you'd almost
need you need the AI though because
there'd be too many language variations
to trap the old-fashioned way
yeah that would be really interesting
because you could you could teach it
all right
um have you noticed there's one thing
that AI doesn't have yet which is a
sense of humor
anybody knows that what happens when AI
gets a sense of humor
or could it could it ever have a sense
of humor
I have
a hypothesis
that humor can be programmed
but only a few people in the world would
be able to do it
and I'm one of them except for the
programming part but I can specify it
because uh do you know I developed the
The Six Dimensions of humor so there's
actually a formula that the AI could
compare anything to and say oh it fits
that formula it's probably a humor and
then I could also teach the AI how to
create humor because there are only so
many forms
have you ever watched the stand-up
comedian
they they use this one form all the time
they'll say for example uh you know the
president of the United States went into
the store and uh doesn't carry any money
with him
you know if you're the president or the
queen I guess you don't need to carry
carry your wallet you don't need to
carry any money with you and then they
always do the same thing imagine if I
tried that
right
so they go imagine if I tried that
it's the same joke
they just something that you've heard of
that's you know in the news are popular
and then they say what if that happened
to a person who's a different kind of
person
and then they just describe how that
would go wrong and there you are you
know it would be easy to say how to add
sources you could teach a nice AI
sarcasm so they could recognize a joke
and laugh at it
and laugh at it
if your AI laughed at your jokes
you would be done with humans forever
you would be
that's
if you're looking for the uh the the
line
where where an AI is just unambiguously
Better Than People it'll be the day it
can laugh at your joke
and I think it could do that in a year
to three
and only because the the shortage of
people who could teach it what a joke is
um if if a programmer who is not a
professional
tried to teach humor to a computer and
you never do it because they would
research it and they'd find you can't
research it
there's just too many different ideas
about it and while all of those
different ideas have in common except
for mine is they're all wrong
the the people who tried to analyze
humor were mostly people who do who you
remember for a living
who tend to be not Analytical in the
usual way so I think most comedians are
not entirely sure why their jokes work
they're just sort of imitating people
whose jokes work
and that works for them too yeah I think
it's just mimicry
you're searching for women who
communicate Love by touch so the problem
is
if you said your language of love is
touch
what will your wife say immediately
oh now I've got some uh I've got some
Leverage
like that's why marriages don't work
excuse me oh I have something to
withhold now I can get everything I want
now I know how much you like this I'll
withhold this if I don't get what I want
what happened to me it was called
marriage
yeah I know you're going to deny it
clean my nails
wait are you talking about me
or was that like a general was that it
was that general advice
I hope that wasn't about me
my nails are very clean I have to look
at my hand all day
right if you look at your hand all day
you end up clipping your nails a lot
all right
um
uh
I I will acknowledge that there are many
people who say their marriages work
my claim is that they're lying
it's not my claim that the marriage
isn't working
my claim is at their life
this is why I stay hidden from people
yeah
I I guess I should tell you that I've
had a complete collapse of
Trust
yeah you know you go through the world
and there's this great scene from
um Babylon five
where
um
the the name of the character was a was
a lamb yeah a lamb coincidentally her
name was a lamb and she was a membari
Susan in Bari and somebody in her own
Planet another member tried to
assassinate her
and she she didn't know who tried but
when she recovered
she asked you know does anybody know who
tried to kill me
now she was the leader of her people
and her right-hand assistant said no
we don't know who it was but he did know
who it was and he knew it was Ben
Barry's and the reason he didn't tell
her
is because he didn't want to have a
leader who didn't trust them in Boris
and it was one of the best written
scenes in all of sci-fi
it's one of the things that that really
bonded me to that show I thought good
Lord that is such clever
complicated writing I love that
and I had been operating under that
for a long time
which is a
an intentional illusion
the people are more trustworthy than
they are
because I I didn't know how to live my
life
with complete cynicism
because you couldn't spend any kind of
uh and you couldn't have any kind of a
personal life without trusting people
right
but I did have some I guess I'm opening
up more than I should I've had some
recent experiences in the past year
that demolished my sense of trust
in human beings
I'm not talking about marriage
specifically I'm talking about human
beings
and
I've never experienced anything like it
or so often yeah it was more than one
event that's that's why it was
interesting
so I saw things I saw parts of humanity
that
just ruined me honestly it just ruined
me
now I imagine that's what's happened if
you're in a war zone
yeah imagine if you were in Ukraine
right now the things you would see your
your sense of humanity would be
completely changed and I was always
completely aware that I was walking
around with an illusion but it was a it
was a voluntary illusion like the
membari like a land the head of the
minbari I wanted the illusion that the
people around me
were trustworthy
and turns out they weren't
so uh that that's a big part of why um
decided to become a recluse
I'm going to be honest with you I can't
stand people right now I just I can't
 stand up in person
and it has nothing to do with the people
I'm talking about people that I
genuinely like and have done nothing bad
to me
like people who are genuinely good as
far as I can tell I just can't stand to
be around people right now
anybody else have that experience
it could be social media that's doing it
to me but I think it's actually it was
actually my real life that did it to me
yeah
yeah it's
um and I don't know if I can get it back
honestly
so
I'm in a little bit of a
existential
something
a reset I guess a reboot I'm in the
middle of a reboot
is it burnout I don't think so it
doesn't feel like burnout no I know what
burnout feels like but it doesn't feel
like that
so
and now add on top of this that like
Elon Musk I went through the same
process you know I looked for I looked
for religious reason to live
was not persuaded just like Elon
look for other reasons to be you know I
thought like marriage
I thought if I sort of you know wrap
myself around a family unit like that
would be a reason to live
didn't work out in my case I'm happy
that it worked out for many of you
but
so as a as my default
and maybe maybe that's not the way to
talk about it but my default is I wake
up every day and I try to make the world
better for other people
now
I hope you've seen it
you know I talk about the number of
people I've cured from various health
problems which is very meaningful to me
I really love that
and and I've told you I've tried to help
many of you in your lives you know be
more successful and get love and stuff
like that and many of you have so that's
what works for me
so everything that you see me do on
social media especially the stuff that
looks like I'm just flailing around or
being angry or something all of it has a
purpose
it all has a purpose I mean I am
enjoying it so that's you know they're
always a sub purpose but there's always
a larger Arc to it
and if you didn't know that it would
look confusing so lots of times when I'm
causing trouble
is I'm just Gathering energy
and I'm going to use it for something
so once once you learn that I do that
intentionally you'll start to see it
yeah
so but here's here's what was like
Weighing on me recently
and I think he was watching Elon Musk
get a on
where here's a guy who imagined being
Elon Musk he's watching this Ukraine war
and he says to himself
nobody seems to be fixing this thing
nobody's even offered like you know the
bones of what a peace plan would look
like
but he could
and he knew that people would listen to
him I don't know for sure but he's Matt
Putin right
I think Elon is hasn't even done
business with Putin because I think
there was some SpaceX
Russian space thing that maybe they work
together so he's pretty tapped into the
you know the whole world he knows all
the players
and so he puts forward a peace plan
which is nothing but helpful
and he gets on
and and here's the thing that bothered
me the the the the criticisms were just
so off base
because people said he was aiding Russia
in what world
is that aiding Russia because all that
happened was Ukraine was going to do
whatever they were going to do anyway
because they were winning
there was nothing that Elon Musk says
that was going to stop uh
Ukraine for impressing hard while
they're winning
so Ukraine was going to do the same
thing Ukraine was going to do no matter
what
what must said
but
Russia might act differently
and Russia might specifically say well
if Elon Musk is putting out a peace plan
I guess I don't have to Nuke anybody
because I've got I've got an exit path
now his his plan might not be the one
maybe it'll maybe a little more but as
long as you're talking about an exit
path
you don't nuke
so what Elon Musk did was he put his
personal reputation on the line
and he decreased the chance of nuclear
war by a lot
and he got over for it
he got on for that
and do you think do you think he was
doing that like for his personal benefit
I mean it's personal benefit to avoid
nuclear war of course
but you do you knew that he was going to
get on so did he
so did he he did that for you
he did that for you and then you
collectively and then the people he was
trying to help from nuclear annihilation
just went on to Twitter and then on
and and I guess I felt that
like you know of course that happens to
me every day every time I try to do
anything useful somebody shits on me and
I don't think it bothered me as much
when it happened to me
but what I saw it happen to him
in this specific example
I just thought people suck
people really suck
they really really do
because there's nothing more obvious
that he's trying to help
and the people saying you know stick to
your lane because you don't understand
it
who are you talking about
Elon Musk is the person who should never
stay in his Lane
Elon Musk is the person you should say
hey here's another Lane
have you thought of this Lane because
nobody's doing anything in this Lane
maybe you could do that one too because
those other lanes came out pretty well
um
all right
crabs want to drag you back into the
bucket
affirmation time
so I'll tell you what is uh giving me
enthusiasm lately
so here's a little inside book writing
stuff people always ask me about the
process of writing books for some reason
it's of great interest to people even if
they don't write books
and I I could kind of see that so I'll
give you a little insight into it so my
process has a very much a way up way
down way up way down path and it always
does and it goes like this I've got this
great idea for a book this will be so
amazing and I'll write some notes I
think it's amazing and they'll start
writing the actual chapters
and they'll look it over after a while
I'll be like oh that wasn't as good as I
hoped
and then I'll write another chapter and
I'll nail it I'll be this is amazing
it's amazing
anyway that that keeps going all the way
till the end it never stops
even right up to publication date it
never stops
so there'll be days I wake up and I just
hate it in the days I wake up like
yesterday so yesterday I was in
Starbucks and every now and then I'll
just reread what I've written
because I need to
sort of
um
re-saturate myself with what I've
already done
before I can make sure that the next
thing is additive so you have to keep
rereading your book that you've written
so far so I did that yesterday
and
it's awesome
honestly
 awesome
the the number of lives this thing's
going to change
is crazy and I didn't realize it until I
sort of saw the hole because you know I
end up micro focusing on a little
chapter
it's crazy now here's the other thing
that's relevant to this commercial this
uh commercial it is kind of a commercial
relevant to the conversation
I am going to get
killed for this book
the critics are going to destroy me do
you know why
guess why
why will I be criticized for this book
just massively
take a guess
you're almost there
how are you missing this
I thought I'd teed this up for you a
little bit better than this the answer
is right in front of you
because I left my Lane
I left my Lane
because reframes are really psychology
I'm not a psychologist I'm a hypnotist
and nobody's going to say you know
listen to the hypnotist they're going to
say it's a cartoonist they're going to
say why is this cartoonist telling me
psychology
right and they're going to say I'm
damaging people and I'm oversimplifying
and I should stay in my lane and when I
was just being a cartoonist it made
sense and then everybody's gonna say
that that uh that reframe is going to
hurt somebody
right I don't think any of them will
hurt anybody but somebody's going to say
well that one yeah that's reckless
right I am going to get absolutely
destroyed
but
it's going to really help a lot of
people
now I'm going to share it with some of
the people on the locals Community I'm
going to run through some of the
reframes in the book just to give you a
sense of it give some feedback might
help me might help me tune it a little
bit but my God it's going to be really
good it will be the biggest thing I've
done
so
if you're willing to believe that it
should be the biggest thing I've done
I would be amazed if it's not a national
phenomenon right if not International
because here's the trick it's not enough
to say something good and useful
because lots of books do that
and that's what I've done before I've
said something that was entertainment
entertaining or useful or both and those
will sell a lot of books because people
like to be entertained they like useful
stuff
but the the extra gear
that I've never hit
that some some people have other authors
have is where the the usefulness of it
is just extreme
and this is going to have probably 80 to
100 reframes in it of which for most
people at least 10 of them would be
life-changing
so and and they can learn them just by
reading them
[Laughter]
reading a comment on locals which I
appreciate I appreciate that comment
yes I've been playing drums
all right
um
big question what's the difference
between God and intelligence
and the simulation the difference is
that God is usually defined as one
entity
and if we are a simulation we're
probably it's probably a group effort
you know somebody built the technology
to build the simulation so it'd be one
versus many and then the next difference
would be that that Civilization may have
had a higher civilization that created
them
so God is one and done
simulation is infinite
iteration
what if we all share one Consciousness
that's more of a word thinking thing I
think it just depends how you define
things
um you're wrong about how to program AI
you know set the rules you give it a
large training set of successful humor I
would do both
so I would I would give it the rule but
you're right it would be useless the
rule would be useless without a large
training set of humor and that's
definitely part of the plan
um
all right
all right midterm predictions
I may stay away from midterm predictions
the midterms could go either way
they really could I think it's a toss-up
yeah I I can definitely see uh Democrats
sweeping
I could see it I'm not predicting it but
it's completely within the realm
is reframing an analogy no very much not
one
AI will be too smart to find humans
funny that could be
uh I think fetterman will be Oz
because that's the funnier outcome
so I'm going to go with the funnier
outcome all right that's all for now and
I will talk to you later
