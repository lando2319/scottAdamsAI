foreign
hey everybody
gather around it's time
it's the best time it's time for a
coffee with Scott Adams and the
simultaneous sip have you enjoyed it yet
are you new
well if you're new you're about to be
introduced to one of the greatest things
of your entire life yeah it's called the
simultaneous up and if you came
unprepared well let me tell you what you
need you'll have to hurry all you need
is a copper mug or a glass attacker
Charles tonight can't even flaska vessel
of any kind
fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing makes everything better way better
super better
let's do it right now
yeah that was good
now some of you might be concerned if
you start to simultaneous sip a little
bit late
there is a grace period yeah there's a
10 second grace period if you get your
sip in anywhere in that 10 seconds
simultaneous
all right one of the biggest news of the
day by far
is that Milo yiannopoulos has come out
as straight
well I'm not making that up
Milo yiannopoulos just came out
as straight
he's decided that he uh that he's gonna
push conversion therapy
where you use your religion to
um let's say you race the gay
I'm not sure how he would put it
I don't think Milo is the most credible
person in the world right now
but he's getting some attention and he's
good at that so
anyway for entertainment reasons he's
always he's always he's always good for
entertainment
uh just to be clear
I don't think conversion therapy is a
good idea
all right
uh here well here's a surprising story
I don't mean to shock you
because I know you didn't see this
coming
but sit down
sit down I have some surprising news for
you
there is a sixth accuser of Governor
Cuomo
yeah
who saw that coming
it's almost as shocking as if
I'm going to go out on a go on in a real
thin Branch right now
I feel a prediction coming on
seventh accuser
now
I don't want you to think I'm psychic
because I'm not
but I can see the future sometimes
and I feel there's just a seventh
accuser
I feel there is
but will we from that side of the Cure I
think the odds are pretty good
probably tomorrow
oh my God
and with all this Badness going on they
people are trying to talk to Governor
Cuomo's ex his ex-girlfriend
or was it wife I guess girlfriend Sandra
Lee
and the headline that I saw said that
she was seen pumping gas in Malibu
Malibu
she was pumping gas
while her ex-boyfriend was trying to
do something that sounds a lot like
pumping gas
have you noticed that the G on the end
of pumping
sort of disappears the g at the
beginning of gas
if you say it closely or you say it
carefully
it sounds like what Sandra Lee was doing
she was pumping
some
gas
but if you were to say this about her
ex-boyfriend Cuomo it would sound
different
he was pumping gas
yeah he was pumping gas
say it quickly it's funnier if you say
it to yourself
well we have a situation on the border
it's not a crisis
darn you it's certainly not a crisis
how could you think it's a crisis
no it's a challenge we're told by the
Biden Administration it's definitely a
challenge not a crisis
and the resources are overwhelmed
so it's an overwhelming challenge
but not a crisis
and
I feel better about that
do you remember when kids were in cages
and it was a crisis ugh
I'm so glad all that's behind us because
now it's just kids in containers with an
overwhelming challenge
and I feel a lot better about that even
though there are way more people
involved
said an interesting thing and I refuse
not to put a p in front of her name
she's pasaki
you could call her Jeb sake if you like
but if you're gonna put an unnecessary
consonant in the front of your name
I think I can pronounce it
don't tell me what's silent
don't tell me to shut up about the
silent p
IC I I'm like you know Pierce Morgan I I
want my freedom of speech if I want to
pronounce the p in front of pasaki well
damn it I'm going to do it
or sake if you like
uh said that most immigrants are being
turned away
what
how can the Biden Administration turn
away anybody
are there what good immigrants and bad
ones
because it's almost as if
Biden is saying that
some of them are good people
and I guess they get to come in
but some of them
even the Biden Administration is turning
away in fact most
I would like to hear
in one of Joe Biden's many press
conferences he has several today you
probably haven't heard of them you
probably think there have been none
but I'd like to hear Joe Biden
describe the the philosophy
what is it that would let you say some
of the immigrants can go can get in
and some of them cannot
what exactly is the philosophy
and Trump had a very clean philosophy
America first
that pretty much takes care of all of it
doesn't it
America First are we done is there
anything else that needs to be explained
and pretty clear
but with Biden's policy of you know
being uh kind and more human I guess
which we all like on a conceptual level
conceptually
who doesn't like being kind
it's a pretty good idea if you can
afford it
but I think Biden needs to somehow
articulate why some people can get in
and some can't now I know there would be
a distinction between the people who
were claiming Asylum
but do we think the Asylum claims are
real
I mean not really do we
some of them surely are real but I would
think the vast majority of them are just
people gaming the system
so do we let the people in who game the
system it's like oh okay you're part of
the good immigrants because you're
gaming the system
I don't know it feels like you either
need to let people in or not let them in
it's a weird place to to put a dividing
line
and I'm sure Biden will be talking all
about that in his many many press
conferences that happen really don't
they
aren't there press conferences
um
here's a story that's got me wondering
about things
there was a Nevada man who on Twitter
mentioned that he had tracked his uh
mail-in ballot
and found that somebody else had signed
it
and voted for him so he never got his
mail in ballot but somebody did
and somebody voted for him allegedly
now
the question I asked is
what
isn't there something wrong with this
story
there's something wrong with the story
right
how in the world do you check to see if
your ballot
got in
but apparently at least Clark County and
I've heard other states and other places
they do have a portal a website where
you can go and you can check
to see if your vote got in
and
doesn't it feel like this is a whole
category of thing that we should
understand as a public if you're engaged
in you know the questions about voter uh
Fidelity and you know transparency stuff
we've all been talking about this
endlessly
but how come you and I don't know
whether you can check your mail-in vote
everywhere or how many places can you
and if you can check
is it easy
do you just go online and put in your
social security number and it tells you
if they got your vote and uh and this
this gentleman who was sharing this
experience showed me that I think they
had emailed him when he contacted and
said there was some problem they emailed
him the actual signature of the person
who voted on his ballot it was a
different person
that's just one example right
just one example
um
whoever's saying I can't hear you
you know the problems on your end right
there are a lot of comments going by it
looks like they can hear me
so work it out
that's funny
it's all about you that one person who
can't hear me let's stop everything
everybody just stop there's one person
who can't hear me
I think we're gonna have to just
pause until he figures it out
all right let's go on
um
so my question is this if we were to
Simply publicize
all the places that have portals where
you can check to see if your vote uh got
got counted now I don't believe you can
check to see if your vote was tabulated
for the right candidate
because that would be uh crossing the
line into knowing who voted for what I
think you can't do that but you can tell
if your vote was counted if you're if
you're delegated so
uh why don't we do that
why don't we publish
just pick a county or pick a place where
you think there might have been a
problem
and just publish the portal
I've never seen it have you have you
seen any news report it probably exists
but I haven't seen one where somebody
says hey by the way did you know you
could check to see if your vote got in
and here's the address just click here
put in whatever probably social security
number I'm just guessing and you could
see if your vote got counted
now there are people who believe they
did not vote
who would find out their vocal
accountant
how many of them are there
wouldn't you like to know
how many of you let me ask you
how many of you who voted
uh checked on the portal to make sure if
it was mail-in vote to make sure that
your mail-in vote was received
somebody says it's not social security
number it might be address or name or
something
um
I'm saying lots of yeses oh a number of
you did
sure did oh well I'm quite surprised how
many of you who checked
found out that somebody voted who wasn't
you
so just so we don't get confused in the
comments so stop answering all prior
questions
I'll give it a moment forget answering
all prior questions the only question is
if you checked
um did you find that somebody voted and
it wasn't you
is there anybody else who found a
problem when they checked
uh so far I'm only seeing that people
had no problem they checked and their
vote was there
yeah received is not the same as counted
but
um at least we could find out if it got
received
somebody says a driver's license is
required Maybe
um
a lot of people did Jack I'm surprised
I'm actually impressed
all right well I can't tell from your
answers if anybody found any problems
but uh certainly wouldn't that make you
feel more comfortable if a lot of people
checked and there wasn't there were no
problems
I would like to know that
um speaking of voting irregularities
which I must tell you no court
have I mentioned that no court
has found any
any proof of widespread voter fraud
we all understand that right no court no
court in the land has found widespread
voter fraud
proof
now they haven't looked for it
which seems important but I will get
banned from social media if I don't tell
you that they haven't found it
they also haven't looked for it
which could be a big reason they haven't
found it right
um but
um early on in the process when people
were questioning the election I told you
that I was aware of some stronger
evidence
that had not come out yet
apparently it still hasn't come out
but Matt Brainerd who probably is the
most credible among the people looking
into this stuff
says that he got delayed a little bit
but he's got a report coming out about
Nevada in which he claims
he claims by tweet we haven't seen it
yet just to claim
so don't don't kick me off of social
media because I'm not claiming this
not me I'm just saying somebody did
that uh that his report on Nevada will
show that there are more fraudulent
votes
uh than the margin of victory
now that doesn't mean the election was
rigged
but this is the claim
now
um
people have been mocking me for months
saying uh may I do an impression of my
critics
I'd like to do a dead-on and impression
of all of my critics
oh Scott where's that good evidence you
said was coming where's all that good
evidence
I think that was a pretty good
impression
um and my answer I've been has been hold
it is so hard
to have any kind of self-control in this
world talking about politics and do you
know how much self-control it takes for
me to just say
yeah no court
not a single court has found proof of
any widespread fraud and I'll just keep
repeating that
but in my mind I'm thinking
hold
hold
and this is what I'm waiting for so I've
been waiting for the Matt Brainerd stuff
now if the Matt Brainerd stuff
produces nothing credible
then I will uh I will say in public
that I was uh misled I was misled and
wrong completely wrong that there might
be stronger evidence that you've not
seen yet
all right so hold me to that I think
people like me
should be held held to account for
making a statement that that is strong
and not being able to back it up because
I made a pretty strong statement
that so far I have not been able to back
up and if after and I'll just to make it
as uh definitive as possible if the Matt
Brainerd stuff doesn't produce anything
that looks incredible to you
then I will just I'll just say okay I
guess I guess I was completely wrong
that there wasn't anything that I saw
that you hadn't seen yet that would make
me think there was something there
so we'll wait for that but if I'm wrong
I'm wrong and I will I'll step up to
that
um here's a interesting story Lindsey
Graham is calling uh part of the coveted
relief package reparations
because part of it allows that black
farmers can get up to 120 percent of
their loan forgiven
at 120 that was a pretty bold
whoever came up with 120 instead of all
your debt is Forgiven
I mean I get why they're doing it to you
know create a little stimulus and and
help people get back on their feet but
it was an interesting way to do it
so somebody got away with something
there
um
so Lindsey Graham calls it reparations
which of course is provocative
but let me ask you this
have you seen anybody who favors the
bill
and favors that part of the bill
uh explain it
has anybody been on TV to explain why
they favor this specific part of the
bill
have you seen that I haven't seen it
should shouldn't we be asking somebody
who voted for it or who favored it or
who put it in there
to just give us their argument
and I would like them to give us an
argument in a way that didn't sound
racist
because maybe they could do it
maybe they could do it but if if what
happened is they snuck some reparations
in there
without collagen reparations
it would feel a little bit dishonest
wouldn't it
because I'm not even engaging with the
with the question of whether reparations
are you know should or should not be
paid that's that's an argument that can
be had uh and I've been actually quite
um let's say I've been open to that
argument far more so than I imagined
some of my audience
but
if you if you sneak it in and you hide
it and you don't call it what it is
that's a different problem
to me it just looks like racism
I don't see how you could call it
anything else now you could say it is
racism but it's reparations and so it's
adjusting for uh pass wrong and so
therefore it's the good kind of racism
but I think we have to be careful about
labeling some kinds of racism good
it seems like that could be a problem
down the road all right
um and of course Biden will be talking
all about this in his press conferences
won't he won't
Heroes some of the you know the
the coronavirus pandemic has created
more
fake news and bad beliefs than anything
I've seen recently
let me just run down a partial list
of the things that people are still
disagreeing on
all right so you of course have strong
opinions of which of these is true or
false I'll just run down the list we we
still don't have General agreement
of whether masks even work
so I won't get into the mask argument
I'm just saying how did we get to this
point
without knowing if masks work are you
kidding me
now I've been pro-mask since the
beginning even when the CDC and the uh
attorney the Surgeon General were saying
don't wear them I was saying yeah I'm
sure they work that's dumb we should
wear them so I've been pro-massed the
whole time but I'm going to tell you
something that I've never said directly
it's not because I'm sure they work
I think it's more likely they work than
not if I had to guess if I had to put my
money on it I would say they must work a
little bit
but that's not why I'm Pro mask
that's not why
it's the persuasion part of it
I have to admit
the persuasion part because when you've
got a mask on
you also are just constantly reminded to
that you're in this situation
the moment everybody takes their masks
off
you will instantly forget about social
distancing instantly
now somebody who said you put the mask
on and it causes people to get closer to
people than they would have because they
feel safe well that's a judgment call I
don't know if anybody's studied that
and I could see a reasonable person
would think that's a big factor but my
my observation and my belief with some
understanding of persuasion is that
wearing the masks is what allowed us to
do social distancing
I just think that as the moment we took
him off we would just forget
we would just forget and watch the
minute they come off you know
everybody's gonna be hugging again it's
going to be instant because I think the
human instinct for touching is just too
damn strong if you if you don't have
something that you're wearing on your
body
you're gonna shake hands
right
do you let me put it in the simplest
possible terms
if I don't have a mask and I'm talking
to somebody who doesn't have a mask and
they put out their hand to shake hands
and neither of us have a mask
probably gonna shake hands right even if
I think about it it's like I probably
shouldn't but I'm going to do it anyway
suppose we both have masks
we both have masks somebody puts out
their hand
that's happened right you've probably
been in that situation
and what do I do I say social distancing
and everybody goes oh okay
immediately
having the mask on allows me to turn
down the handshake
you got that right
now there's a similar argument going on
in Texas because the the the government
of Texas the state decided that they
would drop their mandates but
individual businesses might still want
to require mass and distancing
so now the pressure is on the individual
company they've got to enforce this
thing they don't have cover from the
state anymore
that could make a difference so we'll
see we'll just keep an eye on that I
think Texas did the right thing in my
opinion the pandemic is over
yeah the plenty of people will still die
that's a tragedy but I think the
pandemic is over
because at this point we know
if you're under 40 and you don't have a
high BMI
your risk is now not much bigger than
just the risk of life you know just
getting hit by a car and stuff so I feel
for people under 40 who have you know
good health and low BMI especially
it's kind of over we're still going to
go through the the formality of it and
to mop things up but the the hard part's
over
uh here's some more resilient myths it
was just the flu
that there was no pandemic at all it was
just the flu
and again I'm not giving you an opinion
of which is true and not it's just a
miracle or just remarkable I guess that
there are so many things we still don't
agree on as people we don't agree that
the lockdowns worked
probably will never agree on that I I
think they didn't I think I think
my personal guess is that it did make
sense to stop the mass Gatherings
probably never made sense to close
schools probably never made at least
maybe in the beginning when we didn't
know much it probably never made sense
once we knew a little bit to stop retail
stores right now how about gyms
uh that's sort of an edge case I suppose
you could say people would just they
could not go if they're worried
um
but uh you know at this point it does
look like the lockdowns were not uh were
a little too aggressive that seems clear
we don't agree whether Sweden was a
success story or not
we don't agree on hydroxychloroquine
still I don't think it's anything at
this point I thought I had some
potential in the beginning but at this
point
at this point if you don't know for sure
that hydroxychloroquine worked
it probably didn't
just saying
um
there's also the belief that the mass of
the lockdowns are part of a larger plan
by Shadow Elites
to train the public to put up with
anything and grab power
that one's crazy
all right some of these I could imagine
that my opinion would be wrong
for example I I can easily imagine that
my mask opinion would be wrong
easily right that's the kind of thing
where you could be wrong I can easily
imagine that I'm wrong about Sweden
wrong about hydroxychloroquine wrong
about lockdowns I could be wrong about
all that stuff
it's all possible let me tell you what
I'm not wrong about
that it's a big plot to grab power
I'm not wrong about that it's definitely
not a gigantic scheme to to grab power
that's the only thing I can say with
complete certainty everything else is
sort of up in the air
here's another one that I I heard today
and I'll I'll say I'll ask for a fact
check on this
so one of the beliefs is that hospitals
are over counting covid because they get
reimbursed more
for treating coveted people
how many of you believe that to be true
that were over counting covid because
hospitals have an incentive a financial
incentive to count people as covid
how many of you believe that
sure it was a little lag here see a lot
of yeses yes yes yes true agree yes yes
yes yes yes yes
absolutely says my audience
um here's a comment I got on Twitter and
give me a fact check on this okay
that hospitals are not they're not
reimbursed based on what disease you had
and as soon as I heard this I felt
stupid
honestly I felt stupid
hospitals don't reimburse
based on what disease you had
that's not a thing
that can't be a thing
here's the second part of that because
you're not convinced yet right because
because you've been reading the reports
that that's exactly what they're doing
how many times have you read a news
report that says that's exactly what
they're doing
they are in fact exactly
charging more for a coronavirus victims
right you believe that don't you believe
that's true
here's the second part of this Twitter
comment
um hospitals charge based on the
services they provide
to which I said
oh
yeah that's obviously true
let me put it this way
do you think they're going to shove a
ventilator down your throat so they can
charge a little extra
I don't think so I don't think so
I don't think they are do you think that
they're gonna uh put you in the uh I
don't know the coveted expensive ICU if
you don't have covid
because they're testing you right
I don't think any of this is true
I I think it's it's almost a hundred
percent belief on the conservative side
of the world and I don't think it's even
slightly possible to be true
Now give me a fact check on this I could
be wrong right and I I could certainly
imagine that in the margin you know you
could find a situation or or a you know
a particular uh patient who is you know
mischaracterized I'm sure that's true on
on individual cases but as a widespread
like phenomenon
no they're charging you for the stuff
they do and the hospital is not doing a
bunch of extra stuff
just pretending you have coveted so they
can overcharge you
that's not happening
so how many of you uh just had your head
spun around probably most of you you
won't change your opinion because that's
how it works new information doesn't
change people's opinions we're not wired
that way but some of you
just said to yourself
what
I I just thought that was true
not only is it probably not true it's
probably not even possible
but fact check beyond that I could be
wrong
um here's another one that we really
have a case stomach not a pandemic
because the tests are getting all the
they're they're too sensitive
so we're picking up people who don't
have it
I don't think that's true how many of
you believe that's true
do you believe that uh we're vastly like
really a lot over accounting the number
of infections
uh because our tests are too sensitive
and they're they're over
look at the S's
yes yes yes
um
I see so well see some nose okay
uh I so here's another one I could use a
fact check on but my current belief is
that that's not a thing
I don't think it's a thing
is it
because
um so I know somebody recently who got a
false positive
so false positives are definitely a
thing
but if you get a false positive
you usually get a second test don't you
don't you if you have no symptoms and
you get a positive test don't you always
get a second test and given that the
reporting
is by individual would the second test
erase the first test in the database
in other words if you tested positive I
assume that gets reported to the
government right the moment you get
tested the government finds out what
happens if a week later you get retested
and you find out it was a false positive
you're the same person
does that cancel out the the first test
you'd like to think it would
but do you think they designed it that
way
I don't know
I'm not sure they could
so here's what I think uh I think the
calling of the case endemic is clearly
wrong
and that uh the problem of miscounting
the number of uh people who actually
have it is probably a thing but it's not
it's not explaining your observation
meaning that as long as the number of
infections was somewhat related to the
number of hospitalizations and deaths
you didn't have to worry too much
about the accuracy of those tests
because if they're moving in the same
direction as deaths and hospitalizations
you are measuring something
so I'm not sure that it matters too much
how accurate those are at least
within the parameters we're talking
about
um here's another one that people
believe you can compare completely
different countries and their and their
outcomes and you can learn something
Sweden being the obvious case but any
two countries you compare
you're almost always uh making a mistake
I just saw one yesterday it was another
case of uh yeah this country didn't do
masks and this one did and their curves
are identical
all right and that's on the internet and
you're like okay here's a country no
masks here's a country that looks sort
of like it they did masks and here's the
curve and it's just the same
ah
it takes about five minutes for somebody
else to come on Twitter and say oh that
one you said Don't wear masks
all the big cities wore masks
so in other words
they both wore masks
so every time you think you've hit one
of these like golden nuggets it's like
ah I found these two countries
they're so similar that I can tell
something by comparing them never
never zero times is that gonna work zero
times you should assume every time you
see that one country compared to another
country you should assume it's false
and you will be right
probably 100 of the time
and if you're only right 90 of the time
you should still default to it's
probably not useful
all right
uh here's a question that uh I wonder
why I don't know the answer to why don't
we know more about Therapeutics
and I was suggesting that this could be
studied fairly quickly and it would you
do it like this let's say you're a
researcher and you call some major
hospitals that deal with coronavirus and
you say can you give me your coronavirus
you know death and hospitalization
statistics so I think you could collect
statistics by hospital if you contacted
them and you had some you know
legitimate reason for it I think you
could correct me if I'm wrong
um and then you ask them what is their
dominant therapeutic
resource like what what's the thing
they're using and what date did they
change from let's say one set of
recommendations to a new one let's say
when Ivermectin became a thing is there
a hospital that went from not
recommending it to saying you got to use
it every time
and then you take those uh now if you're
going to compare
two hospitals
how useful would that be
zero I just told you comparing any two
countries is worthless
comparing any two hospitals
or worthless because there are too many
other variables but suppose you got a
bunch of hospitals
and you got enough of them so that
whatever other differences might be
canceling out and you say look all the
ones that did Ivermectin had great
results all the ones who used something
else had less results and that still
won't tell you for sure because there's
still too many variables but it was so
it certainly would get you a little
closer right you'd be maybe crawling
toward the truth if you had enough
confirmation
and I'm just wondering why I don't see
anybody trying to get more information
on Therapeutics because when we keep
talking about this amazing drop off
that was unexplained somewhat uh after
the holidays
and of course
smart people said uh it's just the
holidays we just stopped traveling and
now the the curve is going down
but at about the same time weren't we
hearing a lot about Therapeutics
wasn't there a lot of news about
Therapeutics and the you know
pre-holiday through today
so I would imagine that the techniques
the hospitals and doctors are using
changed quite a bit
wouldn't you assume that the uh let's
say the weight
you know if not the specifics but at
least the weight of what was
diagnosed or prescribed therapeutically
don't you think that looks completely
different in February or March
to what it did in say in November
do you think that on average the doctors
are prescribing pretty much the same
stuff therapeutically
I don't know but I feel like this is a
giant thing that we should understand
better and it's studyable it might be
hard but I think you could tease now
um
do we have enough data now to know that
in in hindsight and I don't blame
anybody for not knowing this earlier
right I'll say again that I don't hold
our leaders fully responsible for their
mistakes
because they were all following expert
advice and nobody knew what to do so I'm
very soft on leadership mistakes during
the pandemic because it was fog of War
some people guessed right some people
didn't the only obvious mistake
or maybe there are a few obvious
mistakes but one obvious mistake would
be Great Britain not doing any any kind
of control and then of course I had to
they had to back up and put some
controls on
um
but do we know now
that we have the benefit of more more
information don't we know that the way
we should have handled this
is to say that everybody was under 40
and had a healthy BMI
and no major comorbidities that they
shouldn't have had any restrictions at
all
do we know that yet or if we don't know
that let's say under 40 was healthy if
you're thin and no comorbidities do we
know enough to know that under 30
would have been better because remember
we have to we have to go all in on the
costs and the benefits because you're
talking about everything from suicide to
economic and hardship and the ripple
effect through time you know maybe a
million people will die from the
lockdown itself some are saying long
term but
at this point
don't we know for sure
that we played it wrong again I'm not
blaming anybody we didn't know but I
think we could have kept the over 40s
home and the overweight Zone
and just and just plugged along I think
we could have and what would have
happened here's my second questions
related let's say everybody under 40
just hypothetically just say everyone
under 40 got infected
because they didn't do any social
distancing
and the coronavirus is really sticky so
they just all got it
how much of an extra risk does that put
on the people who had to stay home
well some
but do you get the same amount of super
spreading from a thin person as you do
from somebody who is overweight
why don't you know that
because you know there are such things
as super spreaders right
some people are responsible for most of
the spread it might be a 80 20 kind of
situation just roughly speaking where 20
percent of the spreaders are doing 80 of
the spreading
are those super spreaders
are they all over the weight Spectrum
could you be a super spreader and weigh
120 pounds
because you're not putting out much air
and you didn't have as much of an
infection
now I'm sure there are some Thin super
spreaders but everything we're doing is
statistical right it's all a matter of
risk if you had stayed away from uh only
overweight people
would you have also stayed away from
almost all of the super spreaders
now of course you can't make any policy
about overweight because
who's to say who's overweight right
um and people wouldn't abide by it and
it would be discriminatory and it would
be fat shaming and it would be
everything bad I mean look at the look
what happened to Chinese American
citizens when China got blamed for the
Coronavirus right so it's dangerous
stuff I don't know if you could make a
policy about weight because it would it
would tear the country apart
but just statistically we might know by
now that that would have been the way to
play it I don't know depends I think I
think it all depends on the question of
whether
thin people can be super spreaders well
not can be
by how often it happens
if it could happen but rare then we
should have just let the thin people go
on with their lives
um I asked this question on Twitter a
very unofficial unscientific poll how
many people gained weight or lost weight
during the pandemic let's see your
answers in the comments did you gain
weight or lose weight again and if you
don't mind show us the pounds
you know if you gained 20 or lost 20 to
show us the pounds
um the result was 40 said they gained
weight
and 20 said they lost weight and the
rest were about the same
so
um 40 in any given year
it feels to me that in any given year 40
of people gain weight don't they
all right I'm looking at your numbers
uh lost 20 lost 30 gained 13 lost gained
same lost
gained up 10 Etc you know I feel as
though this experience really uh
highlighted
the importance of framing
now I I've told you that I'm going to
try to use current events
to teach you something useful for your
actual life we'll just use the context
of current events to do it
do you think it's because the topic or
the technology
wasn't my Wi-Fi because I've got two
devices running on the same Wi-Fi
okay it looks like we're back
all right looks like we're back
all right so I was saying that uh I'm
gonna try to teach you something useful
for your real life based on current
events so I won't be just talking about
the news try to make it useful and here
is a framing that I think made a big
difference
in the beginning of the pandemic when it
was clear that we would spend some
amount of time
um not being able to do our normal lives
I told you that you should see it as an
opportunity
because there might be never another
time in your life where you would have
we thought weeks in the beginning but it
turns into months you would never have
this opportunity
to work on whatever your side project is
or to get in shape
and that rather than seeing the uh
pandemic as nothing but a problem
you should see that it opened up some
opportunities that you would never have
any other way which is the ability to
maybe work out more or spend time with
your family do whatever you want learn
language develop a thing and when I'm
watching the comments go by
I wonder if the uh the mental framing
that people brought to this
determined whether you lost 40 pounds as
a lot of people did
or whether you just had a bad year
I I I look at it myself I started I
think I started two businesses and I
doubled down on my weight training got a
little got a little extra going here on
the muscles and I looked at it as a once
in a lifetime opportunity to do the
things I could never otherwise have done
I will bet you
that the people who simply said and it's
just just a point of view hey
opportunity
I'll bet you they're the ones who lost
weight I'll bet you
and and if you don't think they're
simply changing your your frame or your
filter on life
if you don't think that just reframing
things can change your actual life
this is a really good example
now I can't prove it because I don't
have the data to do that but I would
really really strongly suspect that the
people who framed their impression of
the situation as an opportunity
actually came out ahead
probably did
and if you thought it was nothing but a
problem and you just had to wait it out
that's probably what happened with you
so
um
the George Floyd
trial is on
uh one of the jurors your number eight
he uh he said he was concerned that
rioters would attack his house if he
served on the jury and his name was
released
that's how I would have gotten out of
jury duty too
in fact
I might have gotten out of jury duty
once for something a little bit similar
but I'll tell you about that in a second
if you're in a situation where
you could be killed
for just
sitting on a jury
you don't have to sit on that jury
nobody can tell you you have to sit on
that jury let me say it as clearly as
possible
if you if you have a legitimate reason
to be afraid of for your safety and I
think these jurors do this is very
legitimate it wouldn't be hard to figure
out who these people are
and to and that there could be some
trouble after the fact
so I would say that every one of the
jurors should refuse to serve
they should all refuse and the the trial
should just get moved to some place
where they're not worried so much about
it so
um that was a smart juror because he
said something that was honest it was
true
it is what the the court wants to hear
you want to know what's honest and true
and
um props I would say this was exactly
the way to handle it
all right I'm going to take it aside and
tell you about a little experience I had
at uh jury duty now first of all I have
served jury duty and I believe that you
all should and in my opinion everyone in
the country
should serve jury duty at least once
because your sense of buying into the
system is really enhanced by by sitting
through the whole process you're you're
sort of faith in the system is restored
believe it or not it actually restores
your faith in the system and and part of
it is that you see so many people
who are unambiguously serious about
getting the right answer right everybody
there I mean the the defense attorney
wants their obviously Advocates but
everybody involved from the citizens the
judge the people working in the court
they actually legitimately
just want to get the right answer
just just want to do what's good for the
country and when you when you get
immersed in that
it does change you
so I highly recommend it if you've if
you've spent your whole life trying to
avoid jury duty just go once you know go
once at least you gotta you gotta feel
it you have to breathe it
to like really really buy into it
um here's how I got under on a jury duty
once the trial was about uh a armed
person with a gun and a meth lab so it
was a dangerous repeat criminal uh
somehow we knew it was a third offense I
don't know if we were supposed to know
that but
um would have gone to jail forever and
blah blah blah and guns were involved
and it's a violent kind of a person now
I was already Famous by them
so while all of my other jurors may have
had no risk whatsoever
I would be sitting here with my name
completely known because it wouldn't
take long for people to figure out who I
was uh
and I would be if he got convicted he
would know that I voted to convict him
and he's a guy with a Criminal with a
gun
who has used guns
now I said to myself I do not want to I
do not want to be on the other side of a
conflict with an armed career Criminal
and so when I was uh when they asked is
there any reason anybody else thinks
they shouldn't serve I raised my hand
and said
um I think drugs should be legal
and the the judge said what I said yeah
it was a case about a meth lab I said
yeah I said I think drugs should be
legal
and the judge said but do you think you
could you know be impartial anyway
and then I said I would intend to
I as a citizen I would certainly intend
to look at only the facts and the law
but it doesn't work that way
[Laughter]
bias is not the thing that you
intentionally overcome if you have bias
you're the one who doesn't know it
so I said I would intend to use the
facts and not be biased but that's not a
real thing
people are people are not designed that
way I could only intend to do it it's
not something I could tell you I could
pull off
well I get dismissed surprise right
and uh the process is you go to the
bailiff and the bailiff has to sign
something to let you leave and as I'm in
the back of the Court they're still
talking to the other people they bailiff
Whispers to me he goes
you're in favor of legalizing meth
and he just looks at me like I'm the
biggest piece of you know turd that is
everybody this courtroom he goes you're
in you're in favor of
legalizing
meth
and I looked at him and I said
Maybe
and then he looked at me and said you're
a idiot
and then he signed my form
and I got my high-end sports car and I
drove back to my mansion
and I felt really bad
for being an idiot
he was still there working his job as a
bailiff
um but I guess he's the smart one
I guess he's the smart one
so no it wasn't because I wanted to
legalize meth I just didn't want to be
killed and so I decided that this was a
job for a different citizen now I'm
happy to do my part and even more than
my part as a citizen I I appreciate
actually stepping up to help wherever I
can
but this was not the job for me because
I would have been a little higher risk
than other people
um
how many days are we going to go before
the Biden Administration answers the
question about why they haven't done
rapid testing
same problem with the Trump
Administration
why the FDA has not allowed the rapid
tests and I guess it's because there's a
reporting requirement which is a dumb
reason so we have to assume that's
corruption
there's corruption in the Biden
Administration I assume it was the same
corruption in the Trump administration
because it doesn't seem to be the
elected people it seems to be maybe the
career people
uh and it looks like the FDA
so I'm just going to say as a default
operating assumption
the FDA has to be assumed to be corrupt
and only because they haven't even
addressed the question if they ever
address it and they have a good reason
I would say immediately oh well that's
pretty good reason I wish I'd known that
but if they don't even address the
question
the default assumption has to be
corruption at the FDA
it has to be you you can't run a country
without making that assumption that if
you can't get transparency uh corruption
has to be assumed
uh Dr Scott Atlas who was with the Trump
Administration who's provocative because
he was more of a open up the economy
kind of a guy uh he had a opinion piece
here that
said something really interesting
um
apparently his field and his expertise
is a health policy expert
all right so Dr Scott Ellis in addition
to being a doctor
specifically he was a
Health policy experts
which he refers to as quote my field
with the broader scope of expertise than
that of
epidemiologists
and basic scientists
and his point is
that if you're listening to an
epidemiologist
you're listening to the wrong guy
even if it's an epidemic
do you buy that because the
epidemiologist only knows you know his
his well of information
whereas somebody like Dr Scott Ellis has
a specific expertise in incorporating
everybody as well and making a decision
that looks at all the costs and benefits
which would include everything from the
suicides from the lockdowns to the
economic stuff Rippling forward Etc
what do you think of his argument
is that a good argument that the the
generalist would be the better person to
make the decision
than the specialist because we just
spent a year mocking people who who
would not believe the specialists didn't
we didn't we just spend a year telling
each other we're idiots if we
don't listen to the specialists
and then he comes along he says do you
know there's another specialty
which is the the person who
can evaluate the specialists
and that's him
[Music]
he's looking smarter every day isn't he
and so I ask you this
Suppose there was a question
in which Bill Gates and doctors or let's
say a doctor will pick a doctor
disagreed
how would you know which one to trust
I'll give you an imaginary situation but
it's not too far from what's Happening
suppose you had a doctor and let's make
this average doctor pretty smart IQ of
140 would be genius level
right not Einstein genius but sort of
ordinary genius where you're in the top
two percent of your class you know
that's that's sort of you know
pedestrian genius not Einstein genius
but smart enough to be a doctor that's
pretty good get through medical school
and let's say this doctor did uh did
some reading on the topic so it's a
Doctor Who
you know dug in a little bit on the
topic
and let's say you have a choice of
listening to this doctor really smart
genius and has looked into the topic
or Bill Gates
Bill Gates I don't know what his IQ is
but if if you know anything about his
backdory it's probably in the 180 plus
range
it's not normal
let's just say that if Bill Gates had a
conversation with somebody who had an IQ
of 140
that person would be like a chimpanzee
to Bill Gates
now I know you don't think that
because you don't have an IQ of 180.
and so you can't possibly put yourself
in his his point of view
but just as your dog doesn't know how
much smarter you are
but you do
right it's kind of invisible you can't
tell you really don't know how much
smarter 180 is the 140. but let me tell
you it's almost a different species
all right it's a big difference
now
let's say that Bill Gates decided to do
a deep dive and he talked to lots of
doctors he talked to this doctor he
talked to other doctors he read some
papers he did some analysis
Etc and let's say they came to different
conclusions about what's the best thing
to do
which one of those would you believe
okay I'm not done yet
first you're going to say to me Scott a
doctor is dedicating his life to helping
patients you can trust a doctor in
general
because they dedicate their life to
helping patients
so that's pretty good as opposed to Bill
Gates who's a robber baron who's
dedicating his life to taking over the
world possibly taking all of your money
maybe enslaving you possibly putting a
chip in your body to control you forever
like a robot
did I forget to mention that stuff
well here's the thing
Bill Gates walked away from the most
profitable thing you could ever imagine
which is running Microsoft and of course
he could have made any number of
Investments that would have been wildly
profitable do you think that talking
about the pandemic
or the green New Deal
he's doing for money
let me say this
as clearly as I can
if you think that what Bill Gates is
doing in Africa with helping them get
toilets curing malaria turning uh 90 I
think of his fortune toward charity
trying to get other billionaires to do
the same
if you think that his interest is making
money I want to say this as clearly as
possible you're stupid
sorry
you're really stupid if you think Bill
Geist is in it for the money
I mean that's really stupid
super stupid
I I can't even I can't even come up with
like an argument why why that would make
any sense
so
here's my bottom line
if if you can't tell the difference
between these two things
now by the way it doesn't mean that Bill
Gates would always be right I'm just
saying that if you had to bet
you know since you don't know who's
always right anybody could be wrong but
if you have the bat
I would bet on Bill Gates every single
time every time it's not even close
these two are not close
these are Worlds Apart in credibility
world's part
so
that doesn't mean Bill Gates is right
about everything right every everybody
can be wrong
um
I I saw somebody complaining about uh
maybe as risky to visit China like as a
for business or for tourism I guess uh
Jeff Wasserstrom he's a China specialist
he was saying that he used to go there
all the time but he's worried about
going there and being detained
to which I say
who would go to China
unless you work for the government and
you kind of have to
why would you ever go to China
in 2021
seriously
I would never go to China
now in my case since I'm I talk about
anti-chinese stuff all the time and I
know that they know everybody is there
and wherever they are
going to China would be the most
dangerous thing I could ever do
I would never go to China because I
would assume they would Target me why
wouldn't they
so
but more generally you know I am more
prominent maybe because I talk about
China in public
but why would any of you ever go to
China
for anything
I mean
rethink that
uh China is planning of course to be
technically technologically dominant and
try to try to develop a whole new
technology that competes with the United
States technology and so that they can
control smaller countries in the future
Etc through their technology and here's
a question I asked why isn't China
already technologically dominant
what is it about the United States
that allows us to be so
inventive
successfully for everything from you
know cars and smartphones and computers
and aircraft and it feels like America
invents all the big commercial stuff
now we have lost control of the chip
business apparently Asia just owns
microchips and if we don't get that back
we're in real trouble in the long run
um but I I guess I'm curious why China
hasn't already dominated is it just that
our system is better
is that it is it just that we have uh
better ways to get capital and there's
less corruption or something is that
what's happening
so I guess I don't fully understand why
we've had this this long abdominance for
so long in the first place
oh and of course the big story is Harry
and Megan
we must talk about them so Pierce Morgan
he quit because everybody got mad
because he didn't believe
uh uh Meghan Markle apparently he once
had a lunch date with her that didn't go
well she ghosted him it's reported and
so maybe he has some personal feelings
about her
but uh I would like to point out the
following thing
I believe that Harry
who looks like a good person
what do you say doesn't Harry look like
sort of a good soul
like you'd want to know him you'd be
kind of a cool dude to hang out with
everybody says so I think Harry's a good
person
there's something he may not know though
you can't really make a woman happy
it looks like he's trying really hard to
make his wife happy
now I think he has to try
but he's still at that age where he
thinks it's possible
I've never seen it down have you have
you ever seen a man make a woman happy
that's not a thing
the best you can do is you can give
people what they asked for you can give
people oh sorry what they want
but
I've never seen anybody
make anybody else happy
have you let me ask you
have any of you made your wife
happier than she was when you met her
um you know if you ask them they say
well I'm happy I have a family or
I'm happy I'm mad I'm happy we got
married so people would answer that but
if you but if you had like a a happiness
meter
you can just put it on people and
measure their happiness do you think
that your spouse
is happier and just in general
than when you met them
and it's not a thing
people's happiness pretty much just
stays the same and when I was younger
when I was Harry's age
I didn't know that
I didn't know that and I believed that
if I met a woman who had a specific set
of complaints
and I could solve those specific set of
complaints I would turn somebody from
unhappy into Happy
that makes sense right
somebody's unhappy because of a specific
problem you solve it
now they're happy right
nope
not in the history of humankind as that
ever happened once not once
not once people will be glad their
problems are solved you should
definitely solve problems
but it won't make them go from unhappy
to Happy
so when you see the you know people were
teasing um Meghan Markle for being a
princess you know she's a wealthy
princess actress talking to Oprah and
she's got complaints
and people are saying uh you have the
smallest problems I've ever seen
and you're pretty unhappy
and here's where we learn
it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter
what is happening in Meghan markle's
life
she will be exactly this person in every
scenario has nothing to do with the
royal family they just happen to be the
ones in the barrel this time right
so poor Harry's he's uh he's on the
treadmill trying to make Meghan Markle
happy
he just doesn't know it's not a thing
it's just not a thing
um I can't decide if I'm happy that
Piers Morgan
quit over having his opinion
um so so attacked because it isn't an
opinion show right
wasn't he giving an opinion on a show
about opinions
so kind of weird that it led to this
unless they all always agreed with each
other until this point
but
uh and I think he's entitled to his
opinion
um
here's a question for you
uh I think there's a new form of racism
and I want to run this by you and see if
any of you have encountered this
I had a situation recently
in which I could hire hire somebody to
do a job
temporarily and
because of the unique nature of this I
knew that I could pick somebody who was
either black or non-black right so you
don't need to know the details just know
that there was a job and I had a choice
and I could either probably hire
somebody black or probably hire somebody
who wasn't
now
if I'm judging my own racism I'm
indifferent
right so I don't have a personal
preference I had no reason to think
there was any you know any difference in
any of the people
uh so on that level how do I feel about
it no difference
but
we just went through the age of trump
and I ask you this question
what should I assume
about the general sentiment of the
average black Citizen in the United
States in the year 2021
about me
forget about my opinion about them
which is just fine
is it fair to assume
statistically speaking all things being
equal is it fair to assume that if I'm
working with a black citizen of the
United States and they come to
understand who I am
and that I said good things about Trump
is that a problem
and here's the better part
would I be doing them a favor
by putting him in that awkward situation
would you want let me switch around so
you can get an example of it suppose you
are being asked to do a job you take the
job and then you find out the person who
hired you as a pedophile
after you take the job
are you happy that you got a job
or are you unhappy that you accidentally
ended up working for a monster
all right so same situation
if I were to hire somebody who would be
you know by the nature of the hiring
would be working with me for a while
would I want them to be uncomfortable
because I feel that most black Americans
would be uncomfortable
spending time with me
is that unfair
and and have we created a whole new type
of uh discrimination
that didn't even exist two years ago
where you're discriminating against
people under the reasonable assumption
that they don't like you
and and is that unfair
to do somebody a favor
by not exposing them
to you
it's a little confusing isn't it because
I can't quite I can't quite wrap my head
around if this is a new form of racism
and I'm participating in it which would
be horrible
or if it's just a bad thing that
happened I don't know
all right let me leave you with one uh
one useful thing
the first politician who can
consistently and clearly articulate the
argument on the opposing side
will become president in a landslide
never had one
we've never had a president
who could give you a full accounting of
the opposite opinion
somebody who can say look tell you what
I'm going to do is X
but a lot of people are against X and I
want to fully explain their opinion
and now after having fully explained
their opinion I'll tell you why I don't
agree with it
that person
wins every presidential race in a
landslide
Landslide won't even be close
because what do people want to know if
you're not going to do things their way
they want to know you heard them
they want to know that you heard their
argument
because you can go the other way if you
give full respect
to the way you didn't go you never see
that you just see the politician say
their way is bad my way is all good
my way worked blah blah blah somebody
said Bill Clinton and I think that's
actually
you might be on to that all right I
think Bill Clinton came close he came
the closest
to somebody who could give respect to
the other opinion you're right and and
how did Bill Clinton win re-election
landslide landslide
um so I think that proves the point but
imagine you you could take that to the
extreme the the first person who does
that
take somebody like a I'll just pick a
name
Matt Gates
so if you don't know Matt Gates was a
champion debater in high school I think
or college I can't remember but he has a
background as like a state champion
debater
and when you see them debate you you see
that debate Talent come out but debate
is still advocacy is still trying to be
on one side it's not really trying to
represent the other side but
he's an individual who is uh I will say
intellectually agile
meaning that he can make Corrections
like he can he can tweak things not
everybody can some people some people
are just you know locked into whoever
they are but I think he could he could
adjust he could he could do things
somebody like him
could say look here's the other side's
argument and I'll I'll explain it
completely
now I'll tell you why we want to go the
other way
landslide
landslide
yeah and it's weird that nobody's tried
it right
somebody said Yang tried to do that
yeah
maybe on some level Andrew Yang would be
a good example of that but I think you
would agree that they just brushed they
sort of brushed against it right there
are certainly times when some people
were more forthcoming but it's just sort
of a little bit brushing the topic I
think
somebody says you're wrong as hell on
this one Scott
I'm wrong that somebody who explained
the other sides argument would not win
in the landslide well I think that you
have to account for skill
if you took an average person with not
much skill that might be a way to end
your career because you gave too much
attention to the other side but if you
were good at it and maybe I should have
said this more clearly if you were a
trained Persuader
uh telling the other side's full story
won't hurt you at all not even a little
bit
if you're bad at it
telling the other side's argument just
puts it out there and then it competes
with your argument that's not good
but if you're a trained Persuader you
can pull that off and it's a
it's a dunk
I've said before that except for my you
know Shady uh Shady personal
personality
I could become president easily
I would just do that
and I would just tell them what system I
would use to give you transparency I
could easily become president if I were
a different person but I'm just saying
my my skill set would make me present
easily if I were starting with a
different person
I'd have to be taller have hair
maybe have voted recently something like
that that would help too
all right that's uh somebody says voters
don't care about that
um you don't have to get many to care
about it
you only have to keep some people who
might have gone either way to feel that
you're the most transparent of the of
the options so you're only looking at
that you know two percent slice of
people who can be moved and that's all
it takes for a landslide
and that's all for now and I'll talk to
you later
uh yes I would need more hair to become
president
am I the Puppet Master
how would you know
somebody says Bill Gates is a College
Dropout who bought dos well if you think
that Bill Gates became the richest
person in the country because he got
lucky
you really need to examine that
all right
um
that's all for now everybody and I'll
talk to you later
