foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened to
you and today
don't get too excited try to keep your
pulse down but there will be
not one
but two white boards this morning two
white boards
too and if you can contain your
excitement
until then wow will that be special if
you'd like this to be so amazing you
can't even describe it to your grandkids
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
a tanker cellular canteen geographlask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the end of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
ah
wow
let's talk about the news
uh you know that uh obesity drug you've
been hearing about well it was a shot
but now they're going to turn it into a
pill so everybody can take an obesity
drug pill
and apparently the data on it is really
good and apparently it's really it
really works
so hey that's good news isn't it uh let
me summarize the good news
the food industry has poisoned our food
supply to the point where two-thirds of
us have become obese and the rest are
struggling not to
but the solution is a new powerful
pharmacological uh
compound or something whatever you want
to call it that you can put in your body
so if you'd like to counteract the
poison that you're putting in your body
that's called food the big farm industry
will give you another poison
that you can put on top of your poison
now with any luck one of the poisons
will slightly counteract the other
poison uh giving you a variety of side
effects that may be better or worse than
the poisoning but that's how we solve
problems here
you know a lot of countries would have
said you know what
maybe we should see this as a gigantic
gigantic emergency
Health Emergency bigger than the
pandemic I would argue
do you believe that do you think obesity
is a bigger emergency than the pandemic
I think so you know yeah it's a
multi-year thing so you'd have to add
the multi-years but if you had it all up
there'd be a lot higher death toll than
than the pandemic but instead of fixing
our food supply
so that we could have actual healthy
food
no we're gonna we're gonna invent
another chemical
to put into your body
and that should fix you up yeah
everybody feeling good about that so eat
like but put some on top of
your and you'll feel fine
you'll be 15 less obese than the people
who ate good food from the start
so that's something
all right I have a question for you this
is just a mental experiment
uh my understanding is that in
California and other places
a shoplifter can walk into a store fill
their little rubber bag full of stolen
goods and walk right out
and if you were to try to stop that
person from stealing
you could be you know maybe jailed
yourself for some kind of violence or
something
don't you think
but
here's an idea
that I'm just going to spitball this you
tell me if this is a good idea or not if
it's legal to steal
could the stores hire a designated
re-theftor
somebody who just stands at the exit and
simply stops the people who are stealing
and saying
um
you know I'm going to rob you now
and then the shoplifter says what
shoplifter says you can't do that
you can't you can't stop me from
shoplifting and then the re wreath after
says oh I'm not stopping you from
shoplifting I didn't say anything about
that no I'm robbing you
because those things are yours now
according to the law you own that stuff
I'm robbing you
and then the store buys it back from the
wreath after let's say you know five
percent premium
so that the wreath after gets a little
uh a little vague there and then the
store gets their merchandise back and
they've only lost five percent
tell me that's illegal
if you can't get arrested for stealing
why can't you steal it back the only
thing that's a problem if you try to
stop somebody from stealing
but two stealings are both legal or
allowed they're not legal but they're
both allowed so just do us aloud
and don't do what's not allowed just
steal it back
hello
I I know that somewhere around the
country there's a slow clap that started
I can't hear it but I think it goes like
I I can hear it in my mind it's the best
idea I've ever heard
no I'm not serious but it's funny
I'm not serious but it's funny
um
Trump is saying he might not want to
debate in the primary because why would
I let them take shots at me
now
does Trump explain things
faster than anybody ever explained
anything
he is the quickest explainer of all
things that I've ever seen
uh let's talk about this why would I let
them take shots at me all right maybe we
should explore this I think I'm done
I'm done that's next topic why would I
let them take shots at me if I can just
say no
it's a pretty good argument
it's a pretty good argument
all right NBC poll says uh
uh it asks how many people think the
country's on the wrong track
uh another way to ask that would be how
many people don't think the country's on
the wrong track how many don't think
that
oh you're so good yeah it's about about
a quarter yeah 74 say it's on the wrong
track
um that's amazing that you could guess
that without any help whatsoever
smartest audience
in the history of podcasts
uh you are could you just take a bow and
maybe Pat yourselves on the back you get
every one of these polls right without
doing any work and I don't know how you
do it
all right
um however although 74 percent of the
country say we're on the wrong track
uh the polls say that Biden will beat
Trump in the next election by 49 to 45.
so let's let's see if you can hold these
two numbers in your head
74 of the public thinks we're on the
wrong track
which would largely be the work of the
president
but while 74 percent think he's doing
the a bad job
they're definitely going to vote for him
so he should wouldn't election handily
it looks like a pretty pretty solid lead
over Trump
now can you imagine a worse situation
you know what would be bad what would be
bad would be another close election
where all the indicators are that the
country is evenly divided and then you
know Biden wins again
and then people would claim you know the
polls were blah blah blah or that they
claim that the election was uh not fair
now that'd be a bad outcome wouldn't it
but you know what would be a worse
outcome
if Biden wins
in the context of 74 percent of the
country think we're in the wrong
direction
that's going to be hard to explain
to the public
all right can you explain why we all
think he's doing a bad job or
three-quarters of us do
but we chose him to be our president now
the obvious answer to that is that they
still preferred it over Trump I mean
that would be the obvious answer
but it's not going to feel right right
it's going to feel sort of like a you
know gas and matches situations
a dangerous place to be in
that our pollings are are on you know
Polar Opposites
that the guy who's doing this job is
going to win
yeah it's a little hard to swallow even
though I perfectly understand it could
be valid I mean the data can be
perfectly accurate but it's hard to
swallow
so to speak
well let's check in with some of our
other predictions
um you know a year ago or more I've been
saying that we were going to have a soft
landing and not a big old terrible
recession
and that seems to be what's what we're
heading for although it's not certain
for sure but there is a podcast and some
comments by chalmouth
Paula APA Tia
well that happened to you I hope I got
that right he's a noted entrepreneur and
podcaster now and he's one of the people
you should listen to simply because he's
insanely smart
look like that's good enough I don't
need to say more he's just insanely
smart so listen to him
but he thinks that uh we're definitely
going for a uh maybe one more year of
climbing out of
you know the doldrums but not a
recession
so he's pretty sure that the stock
market will you know start to go up in
2024.
yeah but the biggest part of his
argument uh matches mine
all right I don't know if you remember
me saying this but I said that the stock
market would probably be better than you
think because there's no place else to
put your money
there's just not really great places to
put money so it's sort of like are you
going to vote for Biden well maybe if
you don't like Trump so it's not so much
that the stock market is an amazing
place to put money it's just not as bad
as every place else
which should be good enough it just has
to be better than the other places which
is what I've said I
so I've only pointed out because he's
smart incredible
and it looks like he's agreeing with
everything I've been saying for a year
all right let's talk about Russia and
progosian
we'll get to uh by the way I'm going to
fix uh RFK Jr's messaging problem on
vaccinations
and you're going to be amazed
you're gonna like it so I'm going to do
that after we do the Russian stuff okay
hang around for that
all right so there's all kinds of
stories about progosian which just makes
it a fascinating Story number one
you remember when you thought that he
was going to go to Belarus
he was going to go to Belarus willingly
and and that Putin was going to fire the
two top generals because
because progression wanted him to
well as of today the top General
shagu is uh he's at work
and he says there's no discussion about
him believing so that was never true
apparently there was no agreement to get
rid of the top two generals
um and uh have you seen the progosian
show up in Belarus
does anybody seen him in Belarus
nope turns out they don't know where he
is
don't know where he is
how many of you believed
that Russia and progression had reached
an agreement
that that's why he that's why he pulled
back from Moscow because of the
agreement
does anybody believe that remember
remember I told you yesterday and the
day before I forget that there's no such
thing as a Russian agreement
it's like a concept that doesn't exist
no such thing as a Russian agreement
they're just things they said they do
it has nothing to do with what they're
going to do
so it was either a stalling thing or as
for the benefit of the public or
something but it definitely wasn't any
kind of an agreement that either of them
thought they were going to keep
now since that agreement
is obviously not going to happen I mean
yes everybody knows if burgrosian went
to Belarus after being stripped of his
military
he'd be a dead man so obviously he
didn't take that deal obviously
so but but the news was reporting it
like that deal had been accepted and it
was all over
how how bad is the news
that they that they thought that might
actually be an actual agreement that
that was really going to happen
all right so here are the things that
might be happening but we're just
guessing all right so here are the
the various possibilities
um well first of all let me let me tell
you what the bad analysts say
these are the bad takes now when I say
they're bad takes
this this is being tested against my own
takes
and you might be aware that I'm not a
military expert
I don't know if I've told you that but
were you aware I'm not a military expert
I am the best predictor of this of the
Ukraine Russian situation so far
but even I think that might be lucky
so I'll tell you about that in a moment
too but here are some of the the takes
that I consider bad but I would be happy
to be embarrassed later by finding out
how wrong I was
uh these are the things being said in
the news today in no specific order
Russia is on the verge of collapse
um what
Russia's on the verge of collapse
what evidences are of that
okay
um
Putin's critics have been emboldened
really the critics have been emboldened
by the biggest critic getting crushed
that that emboldened the critics
because the biggest critic just got
crushed and will probably be dead pretty
soon how does that embolden anybody
that doesn't make sense to me
um about their cracks in the system now
yeah Russia's got cracks in the system
well there are always cracks in the
system it's a pretty cracky system
cracks all over the place but they don't
seem to be vital cracks I don't say
anything falling apart
uh and then my favorite one this is the
the ultimate NPC comment
and I shudder when I say it
because when it comes out my mouth is so
hackneyed and uncreative
and obvious
and I'm going to say it but my mouth
will have trouble forming it so it might
look strange so some people are saying
the emperor has no clothes
the emperor has no clothes
I can't even say it right the emperor
the emperor has no clothes they say
now I'm only offended by that
because it's what everybody says
everywhere all the time in every
situation
could could we have one situation where
somebody doesn't come in to be the smart
one and say you know
you know Scott
I think in this situation This Global
military-industrial complex uh in this
uh geopolitical situation I feel like
the emperor has no clothes
that's how you say that
um let's see what else uh
so
I would see there's only one thing
that's different as far as I can tell
and that one thing is that uh pragosian
changed the war narrative
to say that the war was for the benefit
of the Russian oligarchs and
the the most devastating thing that
progression said I didn't see it till
today
was that he said the point was to disarm
Ukraine that's what we were told
he goes if Ukraine had 500 tanks before
we started now they have ten thousand
so he went through the numbers I'm
making up the numbers but he went
through the numbers of what military
assets Ukraine had before the war he
goes they have 10 times the military
Assets Now
than before we disarmed them
it was the whole thing's a waste of time
pretty strong point
right
so if there's any threat to Russia it's
because that narrative uh may catch on
but I saw some video of the uh the
locals talking about pregosian and I was
really wondering what did the Russian
public what do they think of all of this
are they favoring pregosian it turns out
that they largely do
but they favor them in a very specific
way as far as I can tell from just the
few anecdotal exposures on the media it
looks like the Russian public
likes pregosian simply because he's
saying something that needed to be said
which is very different from wanting him
to be your new leader
and I'm not sure everybody's catching
that
I feel like the Russians love
progression because he's strong he was
you know doing some of their military
successes and then he also criticized
the war
which publics like that publics like
tier Wars get criticized if it's a war
that seems optional
so I think he might be popular but not
popular in the way that they want him to
be their next leader
that's that's my current take because I
didn't see and I suppose nobody would
say that on camera but I don't think
they'd say on camera yeah we'd prefer
him to be our leader so I don't think
that's happening I think that he's
popular as a let's say a folk hero kind
of thing a war hero folk hero martyr but
he he doesn't seem to be who they want
to be their leader yet I mean maybe that
changes but it does suggest that Putin's
still in a solid place
um and maybe maybe Putin needs to play
it a little differently and accept some
criticism maybe because Putin is really
good at least I observe of letting
people you know waste their energy
on you know running across the country
to attack nothing basically because he
just because the Russians just got out
of the way and just said all right just
run across the country sort of just you
know expend their energy a little bit he
seems to be good at that
he's a good chess player so to speak all
right
here are the various theories that I'm
hearing from people watching the
situation one is that uh Putin tricked
pregosian into
attacking
that really Putin all along wanted to
get rid of progression so he sort of
baited him into attacking so that he'd
have better excuse to get rid of him
what do you think I'll I'll just give
you a few more theories
yeah I'm not seeing a lot of support for
that it doesn't feel like a good way to
play it because you know a better way to
play it would be
kill him just kill him I don't think he
had to do any public relations is Putin
for God's sakes you can just kill him
and there's yeah there's a rumor that he
might have tried but I don't think
that's that rumor is confirmed all right
um
let's see yeah I don't think it was a
Putin lured him into attacking Moscow I
would think that's unlikely
here's another one
um
Putin and pagosian were in on the plot
and the two of them were working
together and really the whole thing was
about surfacing the traitors so that
progression was not a real Trader he was
a fake Trader that would make the real
Traders join him and then they would
surface themselves and then Putin would
say ah there's the real Traders and then
he would he would kill all the real
Traders
because right because that's the sort of
thing you want to do right in the middle
of a hot War
right in the middle of a hot War you
want to run an op in your own country
that looks like a revolution just to
surface the Traders
okay I'm going to say that one's
unlikely
all right how many think that that was
how many say yes to that that
progression and Putin were working
together and it was an OP
any anybody
I saw one person say possibly
yeah I'm I see some yeses over here
all right I see some more yeses on
YouTube Lassie yeses actually
some say likely I would say it's the
least likely possibility
least likely
of all the possibilities it's the lowest
one
I don't think you're going to see any
indication in the future that they're
friends
so this is one we'll probably know for
sure
if if six months from now you see them
together partying well then you're right
you're probably right but if in six
months
uh
backpedaling
not backpedaling
I gotta get rid of this troll
back Peddler back Peddler is what NPCs
say before I hide you I want you to know
you're an NPC all right now I'm denied
you
yeah the the slip-flopping and the back
Peddlers those are all NPCs if you hear
anybody say he's a flip-flopper he's a
back Peddler he's walking it back now
they're almost always
talking about something that didn't even
happen
like nobody walked anything back almost
always it's just there's the NPCs just
say those words
remember there's no clothes he's
backpedaling
there's just like 20 phrases that the
NPCs use for every situation and that's
just one of them here's backpedaling
all right
um
here's another theory
theory is that uh
so this was in the news today MSN MSN
uh they said that there's a report there
British intelligence says that the
Russian Security Forces threatened the
Wagner family members and that's why
Wagner turned back from Moscow
where did you hear that first
who uh
who was the first person who speculated
that the most obvious thing Putin could
do
would be to directly threaten the Wagner
family members
because it looked like
the one and only thing that would stop
them
now I'm not going to take uh I'll take
credit for having predicted it if it
turns out right
I don't know that this will turn out to
be the answer
it would amaze me if they didn't do that
if you were Putin and you found out that
your Security Services had not
threatened the Wagner family members
wouldn't you be kind of angry
I go
um guys what are you doing
do you know there's a military on our
doorstep right
and we know where their family members
are
have you not threatened them yet
or at least tell the Wagner people that
they're they are going to threaten them
they don't have to actually directly
threaten them
imagine you're let's say I don't know a
colonel or something in the Wagner Army
and your your phone rings
and it's your wife
she says uh honey
the Russian Security Services are in our
kitchen
what are you up to
that that's pretty much the end of it
because I don't think anybody lets their
wife die
to go into a you know a kill box in
Moscow that they probably won't survive
anyway
I don't know if this is the whole story
but it would be real surprising if they
didn't threaten the family members it's
the most obvious thing to do and by the
way
this is why
this is why
uh Biden is wrong when he says what good
is your second amendment going to do
against you the nuclear weapons of the
United States to which I say nuclear
weapons
we're not going to use our you know ARs
and or you know our Glocks against your
nuclear weapons
no we're going to round up your family
now when I say we I don't mean I would
be evil enough to do that personally
maybe I might be in in the war I might
be but somebody's going to do it
somebody's going to do it right there
would have to be actual soldiers and we
would probably have a pretty good good
idea before long who those soldiers were
and then people would visit their family
you don't think they would in America no
in America we would visit their family
right away
right away I'm not saying we should I'm
not saying it's good I'm not saying
anything except that it would happen of
course it would
so I don't know how you could run a
proper how could you even have any kind
of a civil war
you know it makes me wonder about the
American Civil War before there was good
communication and before you could
identify people you didn't know exactly
who was fighting who yeah it was
happening in general sense
but don't you think that there were um
don't you think that there were family
members from one part of the country
that were in the wrong part
and they probably got it at a bad time
didn't they I'll bet you I'll bet you if
there were southern plantation owners
who had you know revolted against the
United States but they had some cousins
that were living in the north you don't
think those cousins got a little trouble
just because their family members were
part of a revolution probably I mean I
don't know but probably it's the most
obvious thing now now add to that our
ability to communicate and find anybody
in the modern era
right you could find everybody's family
member
pretty easily right that's a whole
different risk than has ever existed in
any Civil War potential situation in the
past you can find their family members
right away and you can control them it's
a bad situation but it does prevent
Civil War
so this might be uh this might be a
little uh warning to our own government
that becoming a dictatorship isn't going
to work so well
because all your families will die
all right
here's another theory which uh since I
haven't heard anything about it today I
would give it very low credibility but
it did explain everything we saw
all right and it was that uh
progressions move on Moscow was a
diversion and a head fake and what he
really wanted to do is whatever he's
doing when we don't when we can't find
him
and one speculation was he is already
or is in the in the process of capturing
some tactical nukes that are within
Russia if he gets his hand on tactical
nukes
it's going to be hard to put him down
right so he could actually carve out a
little fiefdom within Russia and
potentially hold on to it for a long
time if not try to grow it and take over
together
all right we got to get rid of you for
using all caps even though your comment
was not uh bad so I'm deleting all the
all caps people even if their comments
are appropriate because when I see them
they trigger me
so if you want to trigger me some of the
show socks that would be a funny thing
to do but I will have to block you for
it
all right
um
so since we're not hearing today that
progression has any tactical nukes
I'm suspecting that's not what happened
right that's not what happened
but baby
um
so I found a video that I made five
months ago it was one of these live
streams does anybody remember me saying
the following right because it's
confirmed that I said it I found the
video about five months ago I said that
Ukraine
uh since the Wagner group was
complaining about their bosses this was
five months ago complaining about
ammunition and stuff that Ukraine should
concentrate their fire on the Wagner
group until the Wagner group revolted
against Putin
does everybody remember me saying that I
actually said they should concentrate
their fire on Wagner until Wagner
revolted against Putin
that's exactly what happened
apparently that's exactly what happened
now the thinking was that because
because the Wagner group was getting all
this credit for being the best of the
fighters if you can take out what was at
least in the press the best of their
Fighters
what would that do to the rest of the
Russian military
oh holy they just took out our best
fighters
and and the best fighters are basically
gone aren't they my understanding is the
Wagner group is no longer fighting in
the Ukraine war
so that means that the best most
effective offensive group is off the
field
now I'm sure they could be replaced
you're only as good as your next
prediction
you're that's true
all right so
um it's it's making me wonder
um
you know it wouldn't be the it wouldn't
be the weirdest thing in the world if
some of our planners are are watching
this live stream
because I did call the exact strategy
I didn't hear anybody else say it did
you hear anybody else say they should
concentrate fire on the Wagner group to
get them to create a revolt against
Putin did anyone else in the whole
planet say that I believe I'm the only
one
right I think I'm the only one and it's
documented
so anyway there's that
so I guess as a wait and see until
progosian uh
uh rears his head I would not be
surprised if he's trying to get tactical
nukes wouldn't you
if you were progression wouldn't you at
least try to get some tactical nukes now
related to this story
um
related to the story
is that Putin is already moved nukes to
Belarus did you know that so Belarus has
nukes that are part of the Ukraine war
now I don't know if that's to keep NATO
out of Belarus or they expect to deploy
them from there
but in my opinion any use of a tactical
nuke by Putin would end Russia
now I know I know I know I mock
everybody who says something will end
Russia nothing ever ends Russia although
the Soviet Union did come down and I did
predict that connection I keep losing my
connection here on YouTube
um
a little buffering problem it's not my
connection because I'm fine on the other
Street the other stream's perfect
so it seems to be a YouTube Problem
all right
um
all right what else uh so you also have
the video of The Proud boys unmasking
that Rose City nationalist groups what
are they called what's the other name
for them
the guys who look like feds
yeah they look like fans but what do
they call them they have a oh the
Patriot front the Patriot front
so some are saying they're Rose City
naturalists some are as I say it's a
patriot front but I guess they clashed
and the the proud boys uh ripped the
masks off a few of them which was just
hilarious you have to see the video of
one of these racist with their masks
taken off the one I saw was like
oh
that they just turned into little girls
they literally just turned into little
girls who had their bikes stolen or
something
it was actually pretty funny
now I would like to make a few points
first of all the left has tried to paint
the paint the event as two racist groups
fighting each other
do you know what was slightly wrong with
the narrative that it was two racist
groups fighting each other
problem I mean it's just a small one
that what are the prominent Fighters
probably the most violent one uh that
was in the proud boys happened to be a
large black man
now you might say to yourself wait a
minute can a large black man be a member
of The Proud boys yes
yes do you know why
because they're not racists
never were
never were now I'm not saying that there
are no members I'm not saying there are
no members who have you know feelings
that I would disavow
I'm just saying that it's not a racist
group
so when they saw a racist group they
attacked them
now there's nobody uh correct me if I'm
wrong there's literally not one person
watching this who is surprised that the
proud boys would attack them who is
there anybody who would be surprised by
that because you think the proud boys
were racist all along who thinks that
nobody right
it is purely a narrative that existed on
the uh the left so they could paint all
Republicans as racists
yeah no the proud boys have never been a
racist group in fact they disavow racism
do you know how do you know how I know
they disavow racism
they just beat the out of a bunch
of races for being
for being a bunch of racists
they beat them up for being racist
there was no other reason
am I right there was no other reason
they didn't have you know then the left
is trying to say it was a private
dispute
no it wasn't it wasn't a private dispute
they just don't like racists do you
think the big black guy who was beating
the the piss out of one of those Patriot
front guys in the video do you think the
big black guy was there uh for any
reason other
then he was just beating up races I
don't think so
now here's here's the other funniest
thing
and again another Democrat said that uh
it's it's obvious that both groups are
racist because they claimed that one of
the people who got unmasked had once
been a member of The Proud boys
so if one of the people got unmasked had
once been a proud boy himself well that
would prove that they're probably both a
racist group right because the same
racist was in you know interchangeably
in both groups right
is that the first thing you imagine if
you think that he was in both groups no
the most obvious explanation is he's a
Fed
he's an undercover guy who infiltrated
the proud boys found out they weren't
racists got disappointed and bored and
said can I get a transfer to an actual
racist group these guys aren't being
racist like you know when I'm in the
private meetings they're not saying any
racist stuff probably because you know
the guy in the room is black and here's
a Cuban and here's a Hispanic guy maybe
it's because they're multi-ethnic I'm
just guessing can you move me to an
actual you know maybe the Patriot front
because those guys look pretty bad can
you maybe give me a transfer
so
anyway the guy who had his mask taken
off looked more like somebody who was
afraid of losing his job than someone
who is afraid of being exposed as a
racist but I think that all happened
just in my mind
all right but it was fun to watch
all right um
how many of you would say that RFK
Junior's opinions on vaccinations are
strangely similar to trumps
would you say that's true not exact not
exact but strangely similar
because I believe that
Trump and RFK Jr actually friendly I
mean Trump actually said that he
actually respects them and I believe he
actually tried to hire him once for his
administration right
so I believe that they have I believe
that they generally have the same view
that vaccinations are under tested
under tested would you agree
now I'm not talking about covid we'll
talk about covet in a moment but regular
vaccinations RFK Jr and Trump will say
you know what I don't think these are
tested well enough I suspect I suspect
there are more problems than than we
know for sure
that's the same I believe actually Trump
was influenced Maybe by RFK now when it
comes to the covid
um Trump is still saying that it's a
good thing we did it and saved lives RFK
Jr is skeptical
but is skeptical disagreeing
not exactly I mean it's a little bit of
disagreement but skeptical means you're
not sure
Trump has to Trump has to sell his
victory because he's a politician
so he's doing his job of selling but RFK
Jr doesn't need to sell anything right
he's an observer to that process so he
could just say I'm skeptical
but it's not that far
from a trump opinion that if you ask
Trump hey Trump
if if it had been a possibility
would you have rather that we tested the
coveted vaccination for eight years
instead of six months or whatever it was
do you think Trump would say no no no uh
I would have no reason to test it for
eight years six months is five would
Trump say that of course not you say if
we had the luxury if we had the luxury
of eight years absolutely of course
but it was a pandemic and so I made the
hard call
and it could turn out to be wrong
the strongest thing that Trump could say
to support his uh his
vaccination campaign
with his base that didn't like it the
strongest thing he could say is somebody
had to be the leader somebody had to
make the call
I made the call
I actually would respect that totally
if if he said you know we may find out
it was a bad idea in the future because
you know as the data clarifies we may
find out that we lost more people than
we thought
if that happens
I'll admit it
you know if we get to that point I'm
going to tell you directly but it was an
emergency situation somebody hadn't made
the call here's the killer are you
waiting for it here's the kill shot
somebody had to make the call
aren't you glad it wasn't you
are you glad it wasn't you
I had to make that call I hope I got it
right we'll watch the data for as long
as we need to uh I do fear that it I do
fear that the side effects are worse
than we hoped I I'm uncomfortable that
they were telling me the truth
I'm uncomfortable with what I knew but I
had to make the call
and then sort of defend that he wasn't
making it mandatory so I think that's I
think Trump's Escape is to focus on
leadership
and admit that data in the future might
might soften the the victory he's trying
to claim
would you feel more comfortable with
that if Trump says flat out nobody knows
but I had to make the call
somebody had to decide I was the decider
I decided but we didn't know
we didn't know at that point if the
virus was a weaponized virus we didn't
know what the side effects of the virus
would be and I had met I'm very
uncomfortable with the potential side
effects and I'm very uncomfortable that
was forced on children for example
because I don't think Trump was in favor
of that so he could say I'm very
uncomfortable with a lot of it but
somebody had to make the call
aren't you happy it wasn't you
I would completely accept that there
would be nothing left on the table if he
said that look we did not ask you to be
perfect
nobody nobody voted for Trump
for flawlessness
nobody expected that nobody expected
anybody to get everything right in the
pandemic no reasonable person expected
our leaders to make the right decisions
that wasn't reasonable
because they we knew they were guessing
they had to guess there wasn't an option
you had to guess
they may have guessed wrong
aren't you glad it wasn't you all right
now I'm going to fix RFK Jr's messaging
problem with vaccinations I remind you
that I've endorsed Vivek Rama Swami who
I think is just a tremendous
asset to the country win or lose he's
changing the game makes me feel proud to
be an American I ask myself would you be
proud to be an American yes Vivek
ramaswamy was your president and my
answer is unambiguously yes
that that's a big yes
yeah we would have the smartest
president
wouldn't you love to have the smartest
president
I don't know if we've ever done that
before I mean other countries got some
real smart people but we've been we've
been not really
having the smartest president lately
right what do you like once to know that
you had just a brilliant president who
was not overly political he was just
trying to solve problems just once right
now I don't know what his odds are but I
would be so proud
to have somebody that smart
in the job
and somebody who's obviously you know a
thorough Patriot
now he's not the only one I I'm so happy
with the list of candidates it's just a
great group of candidates except for
Biden of course
you know I think I think that RFK JR
could be a great president as a Democrat
potentially
potentially you know I mean it's
big unknown but potentially
and
um I think DeSantis is a strong
Republican he he looks
like he might be fading a little bit I
just don't think he's catching on
doesn't seem to be getting the traction
to to do anything important
um well let's go to the Whiteboard so
I'm going to fix RFK Jr's messaging on
vaccinations I watched him talking to uh
Bill Maher on Bill Maher's uh Club
whatever Club random show he does on
YouTube
and
first of all I was impressed that a
40-year clean recovered addict
would sit in Bill Moore's
Club random wall Bill does you know
marijuana and drinks heavily
you know he clearly it indicates to me
that he doesn't have a problem anymore
meaning that whatever his problem is
it's under control
so that was good I mean it was kind of a
kind of a brave thing to do in my
opinion but I will I might also fix
other candidates messaging because I
like to talk about persuasion so it's
less about who's your president and more
about teaching you persuasion okay so
think of this as a persuasion lesson for
you when it goes like this
would you agree with the following
statement
that if all you have is a hammer
everything looks like a nail you've
heard that right if you're a carpenter
and somebody says hey I have a problem
the first thing you think is yep I think
I can Hammer that out
I think I could maybe use my toolbox on
that if you're a lawyer you see the
world through a lawyer filter if you're
a scientist you have a science filter
would you agree just in general we all
have our little filter from our
experience
now the following is speculation
but I feel confident about it
that when scientists try to persuade
they're trying to persuade other
scientists and to do that use you know
the scientific process use data and
study using randomize control trials and
peer review But ultimately scientists
are trying to persuade other scientists
and then then if you get enough
scientists on the same side that's what
persuades the public
now if a scientist sees a study with
strong correlation
and then they put their science hat on
how do they deal with a study that has a
strong correlation so let's say if you
do this you'll get this side effect it's
a correlation what does the scientist
say
scientist says I'm not I'm not going to
be fooled by correlation you're going to
have to do better than that correlation
doesn't get it done
you're going to have to show me a whole
bunch of studies that come at it from
different angles and every one of them
points in the same direction when you're
done then I'll think maybe it's
causation but a study or two that
they've faced the right the same
direction not good enough the only thing
we know for sure is there's a
correlation so that's how a scientist
would would treat that right now suppose
you're a lawyer and your your job is to
convince 7 of 12 lawyers in a civil case
that some pharmac pharmacological drug
harm somebody
are the jurors scientists
are juror scientists no they're not
so what does it take to convince a
scientist
versus what it takes to convince a juror
and not even all of them you only did
seven out of 12 for a civil case well
I would say that a scientist who will
not be fooled by correlation because
they know that that could be a
coincidence but a juror will always be
fooled by correlation
jurors jurors will always be fooled by a
study that says every time somebody does
this there's a good chance that this
happens the the juror is going to say
well that's that's proven
there's your data it's proven right now
RFK Jr was in the job for much of his
career of being a lawyer convincing
juries
that correlation was telling you a
little bit more than maybe you told you
maybe maybe it's a little bit more let's
say uh
exposing the truth than the scientists
would be willing to accept
so does it make sense there's somebody
whose job
was to push correlation as far as it
could be pushed
for the purpose of winning a lawsuit
do you think that that person is going
to have the same world view
the next time a new study comes out
compared to the scientists and the
answer is no
you you would not expect any reasonable
person with a good functioning brain
to not be influenced by their
environments
so RFK Junior's environment is a little
bit friendlier to correlation
because that's that's sort of his
biggest tool
the scientists are more wary of that
because that's where all their mistakes
are
the big mistake of a scientist would be
to confuse correlation with causation
that'd be like the worst mistake so
they're going to be like you know no no
no no you know you've only proven
correlation we're done
whereas the lawyer is going to give 7
out of 12 to say you know
it's not proven but in a civil case you
just have to think it's slightly more
likely to be true
slightly more likely to be true
is not even close
to prove it they're really far away
so RFK Jr has been living in a world in
which strong indications really mean
something
scientists live in a world where strong
indications are false
in fact usually false most correlations
turn out to be just coincidence I think
I think that's true I think most of the
time correlation does not translate into
causation most of the time
so
this is half of the story all right
let's just have so in this so this would
suggest
foreign
who and let me let me be very clear RFK
Jr does completely understand
that correlation does not mean causation
I just want to be clear he completely
understands that he says it directly you
know he gives examples so he understands
that but he's still in that world in
which correlation means more than it
should right so he should Influence
People in that situation
so here is his message as I heard it on
the Bill Maher's show he's saying I'm
not anti-vaxx I'm Pro science
um I'm appropriately skeptical
appropriately
appropriate skepticism would be like a
scientist right the scientist would be
appropriately skeptical
Achilles you have to go away for using
all caps goodbye
and the old bag
you have to go away for using all caps
to complain about the guy I didn't
delete for having all caps
so that was ironic all right
um and then then RFK Jr
um wraps up his his messaging by saying
you know we don't like better testing
you know I would like to see that the
vaccinations were tested better Etc now
there's a dispute
when he says that the let's say the
vaccination the childhood vaccinations
when he says that they were not tested
in randomized controlled trials what you
should know is that scientists say yes
they were
did you know that
like one of his biggest claims is that
things were not tested in randomized
controlled trials and the the response
to that is yes they were
here's the name of the trial
here's the study
every time
now I don't know which one is true
do you
I mean I watched a very credible person
say yeah every one of these is
absolutely studied with a randomized
controlled trial no doubt about it
I don't know
I don't know I got two people that I
both consider incredible who have
complete opposite opinions about
a fairly easily verified fact
I don't know what's going on there
so given that the given that most of us
are will are confused about what did or
did not happen would you agree with that
most of the public
doesn't quite know what's happening
we're suspicious we're skeptical we're
scared we're mad but we don't really
know at least I don't and I've kind of
looked into it I'm a little confused
about what's happening
all right so what do you agree that RFK
Jr's messaging is a little bit of a
lawyer messaging
and doesn't quite doesn't hit me in the
feels
does anybody have that sense all right
so now I'm going to show you how to fix
it
to make it compatible with everybody
and it's easy
it's a high ground maneuver
so the better approach
is to just say
some version of this and now the the
Preamble is important look
I know that the public is very mixed on
whether the vaccinations have been
adequately tested or not
but the one thing where we can all agree
is that while it might be true that I
might think that these studies of
correlation mean a little bit more than
you do
admitting it directly I might be more
biased because I've seen more things
I've seen more things
so I am probably a little biased to
think that the studies showing a
correlation with problems are are likely
to be true but let's meet in the middle
can we meet in the middle let's meet
where everybody agrees
we need to come up with a better system
for testing all of our meds and then
communicating to the public what has
been tested and how
we're done
and now we're done
hey I think that when you said that
correlation study about autism I think
that you were a confusing correlation
with causation RFK Jr you know what that
might be entirely true
so let's meet at The High Ground where
you and I can agree that it hasn't been
tested to my standards of satisfaction
and I don't think it's been tested to
your standards of satisfaction either so
why don't we come up with a a better
requirement for testing with some kind
of you know government control and we'll
make sure that you and I are both happy
the next time something gets tested and
by the way there are a number of
correlations that I think the government
and not private entities the government
should fund some independent tests to
find out if these correlations are a
causation
so let me accept that I am more alarmed
than you are about the potential harms
of vaccinations I don't want you to be
as alarmed as I am I want us both to
come up with a better system so that you
and I can agree with better data
so let us not argue about whether this
correlation means more than it does
because we can't solve that but we can
solve it if we improve our testing
system so let's all focus on the thing
we can do and and ignore the thing you
can't do you can't go back in the past
can't move backwards in time
we can take our goal systems over goals
we can take our goal of safe of safe
vaccines everybody has the same goal and
we can turn it into a better system by
improving not only how we communicate
what is being tested but to make sure
that our tests are rigorous that they've
gone at least X number of years and that
the public is fully informed about not
only the risks
but any other correlations Etc now
now imagine the critics come after him
but but but you said this thing in the
past you made this claim you know 10
years ago you made this claim and and
saying says it's wrong
then RFK JR says you know science is one
of those situations where we'll always
be debating what's true that's what
makes science great I'm not a scientist
I'm not the one who can tell you what is
true I can tell you that it's very bad
that we can't agree so we're going to
have to improve the way we come to
agreement
so I'm going to fix the way we come to
agreement I'm not going to make you
agree with me today
president RFK Jr you couldn't beat that
that that's an unbeatable frame that's
what The High Ground is The High Ground
is the unbeatable frame
if you can find The High Ground it makes
people release the you know the the
argument that's the small argument and
it forces them to rise to the higher
argument because people don't like to be
in the weeds as soon as somebody shows
them The High Ground
everybody Rises to it just automatically
you can't stay away from it
so
he's never going to get traction saying
that he's appropriate appropriately
skeptical because I did a poll on
Twitter and found out that nearly a
quarter of my audience doesn't know what
the word means
like actually literally doesn't know
what skepticism means
because there's a number of people who
think skeptical means it's not true
you all understand that skepticism means
you just don't know what's true right
it doesn't mean you know it's not true
it just means you don't know what's true
now that's a big difference so if you've
got somebody out there trying to run for
president and he's saying you know you
might disagree with me about the about
the effectiveness of the vaccines but I
got to tell you I'm skeptical
he loses 20 percent of his voters 20 of
his voters because they don't know what
the word means literally don't know what
the word means
it's terrible
and the I'm not anti-vaxx I'm Pro
science
can you feel that
I can't
do it like feel it in your body
nope nope it's just a concept
it's smart
it's true it's accurate
it's uh it's short it's Direct
but it's just conceptual
nobody nobody gets elected on conceptual
messaging
you know what gets you elected
build the wall
right you can see the wall
you you could you have the fear of
what's on the other side of the wall
you've got fear visual persuasion it's
simple everybody understands it that's
what political messaging is and RFK Jr
is a is kind of an interesting character
in a lot of ways but one of the
interesting things is he's he's really
gifted
at communication really gifted like
super gifted
but he's getting this wrong like crazy
if he fixes this
I don't know how you could keep him out
of the office honestly it seems like you
would just walk into the office because
he has basically one problem he's just
got one problem and it's as easily
solvable as this
now the problem is that even if you
solve this and changed his messaging
he's still so shut down from the
mainstream media that I don't know
anybody would hear it
but he's so far done a good job of
getting attention how many of you have
seen the video of him working out
without his shirt
how many of you seen that video
now that's persuasion
what what is one of the things that at
least in the back of your head you might
worry about with RFK Jr what would you
worry about
well you might worry that he's too old
because you know 69 you have two terms
he's going to be up there right
late 70s if he finished
so you'd worry you would worry about age
but then he takes his shirt off
and you go okay I'm not worried about
age anymore
it immediately eliminates age as a as a
factor immediately now yeah I see what
you're saying that uh you're you're
questioning whether he got there
naturally
in my experience
nobody can look like that naturally
I I don't think it's even possible
I don't think so but it doesn't mean
he's doing anything illegal all right he
may he may be just doing testosterone or
something like that but I don't think
you can get there just by exercising and
eating right I don't think so because
it's yeah even with good genes I don't
think I don't think so
and the reason I say that is uh
I also exercise quite a bit and I'm not
getting there
I'm not getting there I mean I'm doing
okay but I'm not getting in his his
range
yeah so anyway that ladies and gentlemen
is uh
how do you get an RFK Junior
elected but I also gave you some advice
for Trump if Trump changes his messaging
it's going to make a big difference with
his base anyway
I'm already bald so I should do trt is
that the downside
there's more downside than that like
getting cancer
I I don't want to make my cancers more
aggressive
I don't have any cancers but if I did I
wouldn't want to be on
testosterone
it shrinks your testes
well isn't that just terrific
that's that's just terrific
so you can make yourself into something
that people want to have sex with until
they have sex with you
then they're like that was a little
disappointing
all right did I watch this foreign
policy speech I did not
uh if Trump worked out you'd vote for
him
uh now as foreign I assume his foreign
policy speech was don't get into
optional Wars right basically he said
just don't get into optional Wars for
the benefit of the military-industrial
complex was that was that basically the
message
I'm guessing
uh
oh is it bio-identical if you get
testosterone replacement
and let's say you were just low because
of age
there's no downside
are you saying there's no downside
because it's a it's a perfect
replacement for something that should
naturally be there
might be human growth hormone it could
be
all right so ladies and gentlemen
a cage match with Tom Finn
all right
uh
hasn't Trump going easy on RFK he has
they actually seem to respect each other
one of the amazing things about RFK Jr
is he somehow managed to complete well
watch watch me say this
and it will just it's going to blow your
mind in a minute are you ready for this
RFK Jr is the first Democrat who figured
out the following thing
it's good to treat Republicans with
respect
why was he the only one to figure that
out
now now that's the reason I call him a
genius at communicating
because that was that was there for
everybody everybody had that
right everybody had access to that but
Obama did the you know clinging to their
guns and bibles so he showed disrespect
uh Hillary did her deplorable thing
disrespect
and of course you know Biden's done his
uh everybody's a white supremacist
disrespect
but RFK Jr just treats people with
respect and I guess he went camping with
uh Roger Ailes like like he's been best
friends
with Republicans forever
it just has never been a problem for him
wouldn't you like a president who
genuinely doesn't have bad feelings for
anybody in America
for like the first time in a while
because I feel like you know I feel like
Trump you know tries to make
everything's America but he's probably
not super happy about the over woke
people right he's just smarter about not
attacking Americans but RFK Jr seems to
have a genuine respect for humans
that you can see it just comes through
he has a respect for humans
and he likes Americans
it's a pretty good deal
um
all right so YouTube that's all I got
for you today thanks for joining best
live stream you've ever seen and I'll
talk to you tomorrow
