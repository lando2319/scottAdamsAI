good morning everybody and it's time
once again for
the best thing that's ever happened in
the history of the universe it's called
coffee with scott adams and the feature
is a very special thing called the
simultaneous sips some people love it
some people hate it but eventually
you'll all love it you just haven't
tried it yet
so
uh
all you need to enjoy the simultaneous
sip as a copper mug or a glass of tanker
tells a steiner canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid and i
like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip and it's
going to happen now
go
well my goal is to make sure that you
learn something each and every time
you join me here on coffee with scott
adams
and we'll see if that happens again
today
speaking of anecdotal persuasion
why is it that the
news tells us we should use data and
science to make decisions
are you with me so far
when you say this cnn msnbc it's one of
their main themes
is to use science and data
right
what is their other major theme besides
you should use science and data
their other major theme is
look at this anecdotal story and draw a
conclusion
that's the opposite
isn't it
so make up your mind mainstream media
either we should use data
and science and logic
which sounds good to me
or or you can feed us continuous
stories about that one time that one
person had that experience and we'll
make our decisions based on that because
you know we will
do you know why you know that the
anecdotes will influence us more than
the data
how do you know that
science
yeah science
can pretty much guarantee that the
anecdotes are going to be more
persuasive than
the data
and yet
while claiming that data is important
they work as hard as they can to make
you ignore it with their anecdotes
here's another one uh
this one i forget which
which news source i got this from but
doesn't matter
it says that mississippi's latest
coveted surge
sees four unvaccinated pregnant women
die of a virus in a week
in america's least inoculated inoculated
state
four unvaccinated pregnant women they're
really taking the anecdotal persuasion
up to
a ten
because it's bad enough that somebody
dies but when you throw in the
unvaccinated and then pregnant and then
woman
they're really going deep now for the
serious anecdotal persuasion
well rasmussen had a bowl
and asked people what they thought about
rescuing americans left in afghanistan
should we need to do that
and 69 of likely voters
say the us should use military force to
rescue americans left in afghanistan
so that's a you know a super majority
how would you like to be the taliban
and know that even though the war just
ended a super majority of american
citizens
are willing to
turn afghanistan into glass
to get our 100 americans back
it should give you pause
because if you were to ask also how much
would you be willing to spend
to make a military action to get our
hostages back i would say
i'd say the wallet is open
right
so afghanistan if you're worried that
we're not willing to spend
to send some military back there to get
them out you should you should think
about that twice because we are willing
to spend whatever it takes to get them
back
if it makes a difference i don't know if
a military operation could possibly work
um
50 only 52 of liberals
think we should uh use military force to
rescue americans if it comes to that
now i ask you this
is this another example
of liberals not understanding how human
motivation
influences systems
because that seems to be that the
biggest
problem on the left
consistent and it it influences all
their topics it imagines that you could
build a system
where people
just have good faith and they just
operate according to what's good for the
whole
instead of what's good for themselves
but of course nobody operates that way
people operate for themselves
so once again
liberals don't understand that if you're
not at least willing to send a very big
ass military operation back into
afghanistan if you're not at least
willing to do it
you're not going to get any any hostages
back unless you pay for them or
something else
so
once again liberals don't understand
human motivation or that at least they
don't incorporate it in the same way
that republicans do
or the right does
there's an emerson poll
that says
that if biden and trump ran right now
trump would win
if biden and trump had a rematch today
trump would win just barely
um 47 to 46.
and among democrats 60 of voters said
they would like to see biden as the
presidential nominee
what
sixty percent of democrats are pretty
happy with what they got
really
they you can't find one democrat
who might have similar capabilities but
uh had all of his mental faculties and
he wasn't 100 years old
nobody
nobody in the whole democrat party
could do better than joe biden so 60 of
people say yeah
let's go with that again
okay
now to be fair if the situation were
reversed
if trump were in office
probably the poll would look opposite
because whoever's in office is going to
look worse right
being in office makes you subject to
more criticism so
i think whoever is in office is going to
look degraded compared to whoever is
just a an idea in your head
now what other polls do we have
hmm
i think there's another one coming up
here too
um
let's talk about ron desantis
you know he he set up all these
regeneron
treatment centers
so you can go in if you've got some
symptoms and you've got a uh
diagnosis of coven you can go in and get
the drip
they'll hook you right up to the
regeneron and get it to you early
and there's a of course anecdotal
anecdotal report of this guy britain
noel noel
who said that he was feeling bad with
the covid but they put him on the drip
and he immediately felt better now
that's not the first time i've heard
that
uh i won't tell somebody else's story
but i did hear somebody else say that
nothing worked until the drip
and as soon as you got on the drip you
just felt better
just like immediately you feel better
so
let's uh let's combine two two things
let's say that the regeneron according
to science as well as anecdote don't you
like it when science and anecdote agree
because here's the case
anecdotally we hear that regeneron works
but scientifically it seems to work as
well
if we have enough of it i think the
problem might be supply actually
but here's my question uh you know
michael mina has been talking for over a
year i guess
a year and a half i think about
we should be doing rapid tests which are
not as accurate as the ones you could
get at your doctor's office
but they're you know 90 accurate
so suppose everybody had a cheap rapid
test and also access to regeneron
on demand as soon as they got symptoms
boom just go get your regeneron
what would happen if we could catch
nine n-10 infections earlier than they
normally would have been caught
and all nine of those 10 people
go get regenerated right away
i feel like we're done
don't you
i feel like that would be that's the end
of the pandemic
nine out of ten catching it early if in
the hypothetical situation which we
don't have now where you have cheap
ubiquitous testing and everybody's just
testing all the time
if you got nine and ten people
but you missed that 10th one
which is the one you're going to miss
probably
you're probably going to miss the one
that didn't have many symptoms
so if the 9 and 10 are on average the
ones who have most symptoms they're
probably the ones with the big viral
load
probably the ones who are going to be
coughing all over you i feel like if you
got nine and a 10
it's closer to 10 out of 10 than you
think
because that one that they don't get
i'm guessing that the reason they
wouldn't get them
is because their viral load would be too
low can somebody give you a fact check
on that
are the tests
uh are the tests somewhat inaccurate
only based on how much viral stuff there
is or is there another source of
inaccuracy besides the operator
so michael meena is pointing out once
again that we have not treated the rapid
testing the right way
because i guess we treat it as a
a medical decision
and therefore it goes through some
approval process and therefore we can't
have nice things in this country
so other countries have these rapid
tests available
but
if you do what what florida has done
which is set up these regeneron sites
where it's easy to just go get a
go get the drip
and then on top of that you do the
michael mina
cheap but not perfectly accurate testing
i feel like you're done
honestly that that feels pretty close to
done with the pandemic turns it into
endemic where it's just always here but
doesn't kill you
uh
talk about your
two movies on one screen
i'm going to read you something from a
source that i think is credible
but only credible for this topic all
right not credible in general but just
specific to the the specific point i'm
going to make is credible
and is completely opposite of everything
i believe to be true
so here's the fun part
is this my blind spot
some of you are going to have the same
experience in a moment when i tell you
what the topic is you're going to say to
yourself wait a minute
that's literally 100 opposite of
everything i think to be true
but it comes from a strong source
i don't know what to do with this
so here's the situation
dr pierre corey
k-r-r-y you've heard of him because he's
provocative and he's been saying things
that are opposite of mainstream
medical opinion
and specifically on the i word
ready for macron or i'm not going to say
it because i'll get i'll get banned
so he's a a pro information
okay i'll just say irobectin guy and
here's what he says about the evidence
for ivermectin
which i believe is literally the
opposite of true
and still believe it
but at the same time
i don't see how he could be wrong about
this because it's his field
and he's looked into it and he has a
deep interest
so let me tell you the what he says
he says that ivor mechtin evidence has
31
randomized controlled trials
and 32 observational
controlled trials
including 26 000 patients and fines
according to him and this is opposite of
mainstream medicine but he says this
finds large
statistically significant reductions in
mortality hospitalizations
time to recover environmental clearance
he says the idsa which is the infectious
disease society of america
won't or can't
recommend it because they're captured by
you know research dollars from the nih
now
how could my understanding
be so opposite
my understanding is that there might be
one or two randomized control trials
and that one of them has been debunked
as garbage
that's my understanding
i don't think it's true
but that's my understanding just maybe
two randomized controlled trials and
he's saying there are 31 of them
could that possibly be true
that there are 31 randomized controlled
trials for
comet
yeah i know you're saying overseas
but i don't feel like it
so yeah and then 32 that are
observational
um so brett uh
weinstein has been saying the same thing
why is it that we we don't even know
this
how how could we think there might be
one or two
and one of them is clearly debunked and
then people who clearly know what
they're talking about say there are 31.
what the hell is going on
i don't even have an opinion
i don't know which is is it two
and one of them is
or is it 31 and they're pretty good what
the hell is going on
i have no idea here this is this is
completely baffling no idea
all right here's something to scare you
uh tick tock has overtaken youtube for
most minutes watched
did you hear that
tiktok just overtook youtube
for most minutes watched
and tick tock
is a chinese brainwashing app
now they don't say that
that's my allegation
and there are some assumptions and
speculation built into this allegation
so when you sue me tiktok
i'm going to back up and say whoa i
didn't say it was true
i said it looks like it's true
sure looks like it
that's all i know i just just know it
looks that way
and
um
the interesting thing is the content on
tick tock
i would like to give you my impression
of everybody on tick tock
can you handle it
my impression
of every video on tick tock now
i'm not very good at dancing so you'll
have to look past my dance moves
i want you to concentrate just on my
impression of the facial
part
so i think from you know chin to head
i'm going to be nailing this impression
the rest of my body well not so good
but
let me see if i can get into the
mood for your first
every single tick tock
video that you've seen
[Music]
and scene
now my understanding
is that in order to make a perfect
tic toc dance video
you've got to have many elements one of
the elements you should have is an
attractive person
male or female
ideally younger
but attractive
that attractive person should have some
dance moves that makes it a little bit
more viral you know can move pretty good
but on top of that
they have to do something with the face
that makes you want to punch them
with a brick
now don't do that i'm very much opposed
to violence
but you can't really watch a tick tock
video
without wanting to smash the people in
them with bricks
am i the only one who thinks that
it's not just me come on
come on it's not just me
yeah you want to kill all of them with a
brick
you do you want to you just want to
murder them
now
i assume that this is what
china's master plan is
i think the master plan is to make us
hate each other with such a passion
because
that face you've got to hit with a brick
i mean you really just have to hit that
with a break
don't do that though it's violent
have you seen the video of obama
i think it's a real video
but you know you have all these deep
fake
videos of obama
but it looked real so if somebody can
fact check me on this apparently he was
talking to colbert
about a you know a hypothetical third
term
and he said if he could just be behind
the scenes sort of as a puppet master
and tell other people what to say
but he didn't have to be president you
know he could just have somebody as a
front for him and his opinions
that that would be his ideal situation
for a third term
now
so i hear people saying that
it looks like a real real clip now i
think he was
somewhat
joking but maybe not so much
because it does look like he might be
behind the scenes pulling some strings
now i don't think he's going to admit it
after afghanistan but baby
now let's talk about uh uh brs have you
heard of brs it's a medical condition
uh it's sort of sweeping the country
and it stands for biden regret syndrome
brs
and
there was a poll by uh let's say
somebody
um what that says one fifth of voters
who
who voted for biden
uh now want their vote back
what
one-fifth of the people who voted for
biden
wish they could change their vote now
one-fifth
do you know how not close an election
would be if one-fifth of the people
really did change their vote from biden
wouldn't be close
it would be the biggest landslide of any
election probably
now i don't know how much to believe
that
about this twenty percent it sounds high
especially when there was the other poll
i mentioned that showed that they're
running neck and neck so i'm not sure i
believe both of those polls i think you
have to pick one because they seem a
little bit conflicty
um so it was zogby that found that 20
percent of of biden voters have some
regret
but
nearly three in 10 or 29 percent of
republicans who voted for biden
regretted it
well only 20 of democrats regretted it
and only 14 of independents
so independents uh seem seem pretty
happy with their vote so the
independents who voted for biden are
like yeah i think we nailed it i think
he's doing a fine job
well here's the funny part um
vice president harris is going to
campaign with gavin newsom in california
to try to get him to
prevail against the recall
and i wonder how that conversation went
um
imagine little noise that is the noise
that indicates i'm thinking or imagining
the scene
imagine
uh
imagine the white house
contacts gavin newsom and says
hey gavin newsom we want to make sure
that you win and you recall
we'd like to have president biden
come out and maybe campaign with you and
give you a boost
and you can see newsome on the phone
um
that is very generous of you
very generous to send joe biden right
after the afghanistan debacle
so that i will be
thought of in the same vein as the most
incompetent president of all time
no thank you and then the white house
says okay okay we get it it's a bad time
but we got a backup plan
we have a backup plan
and gavin newsom says
thank goodness
i don't i don't need to hear the details
but please
don't you know don't do my campaign
by sending me joe biden
i mean nobody's going to give me an
extra vote because joe biden the the
architect of the afghan disaster
don't want that
so just you know send somebody good
next thing he hears is that kamala
harris has been chosen
literally the the vice president
that most people think
isn't up for the job
the person
the only person in american politics
right now
fact check me on this but
probably the lowest regarded
politician in the national domain
would you say
could you think of anybody in the
national domain not the states not
governors
but in the national domain is there
anybody with a worse reputation right
now
pelosi i don't know pelosi is probably
really popular with her own team though
i can't i can't well omar okay that
would have been
uh
yeah omar might be less popular okay
that would that would be a good example
but uh poor governor newsom he seems
doomed because if you have to rely on
the
uh on the glow of kamala harris's
reputation
to pull you over the finish line
you might not make it over the finish
line so it's not looking good
meanwhile over in chicago 46 people
including eight children have been shot
over the weekend
46 people shot
in chicago over the weekend
question
how many people were shot in kabul over
the weekend
i mean actually seriously how many
people in kabul
were shot
over the weekend
i mean it might have been more
but
you're not sure are you
it might have been more
could have been a lot more
but you're not sure
just think about that
think about the fact that off the top of
your head
you're not sure
if chicago had more gun violence than
kabul this weekend
i don't know
yeah
well here's the fun part i know you're
waiting for the good part i took you
through all the bad part to get to the
good part to make it feel extra extra
good and watch how good this feels
we have some news about the upcoming
arizona audit results
uh and from this tweet whose name i
didn't write down wendy
wendy i don't know
uh and
tweet says the audit is coming guys
i promise you now here's what we're
gonna do we're gonna read between the
lines okay so i'm gonna read you the
tweet
and the rest of the thread
and then i want you to see
if
wendy rogers yes thank you it's a wendy
rogers tweet
and i want you to see if you can read
between the lines
and tell me if wendy rogers is hinting
to you that there's something big coming
or is she hinting that they didn't find
anything
all right so we're going to read between
the lines and see what you think did
they find the goods
or did they not because at this point
they'd be signaling to us in advance i
think right so i'll read it again look
for that
the audit is coming guys i promise you i
get a lot of comments asking and people
think i can speed it up but i can't
speed it up it is a process and it is
coming
also other information is coming out i
can't disclose
just know that it is all going to happen
and this is real
keep the faith
make sure your state is doing an audit
because when our order comes out the
next steps are
are to get this done in other states
start pushing that now
okay
now
did you hear in any of those words
an indication that they found enough
fraud that would change the outcome of
the election
how many people think
that this is hinting that they found it
they found the goods
i'm going to look at your comments
i'm saying no's yeses knows
maybe nothing
huge nope yep yep i'm seeing yeses and
those
so you're kind of split but i think more
no's and yeses
here is my official opinion
this looks like a no
right now we can't know for sure so
we're all we're all just guessing and
you know trying to calculate the odds
here but if i if i had to place a bet
i would bet that the outcome just based
on the reading between the lines my bet
is that they will find some fraud
or
they will find that there could have
been enough fraud
but they couldn't prove it
so i think where this is going to come
out is
there could have been fraud but we
couldn't look at everything
but we didn't find enough we found a
little
and that suggests that there is fraud
not necessarily enough to change any
result
but
we think that it could be there because
we couldn't check everything
you want to bet against that prediction
i wouldn't bet against that prediction
as predictions go
that one's probably
as accurate as any prediction will ever
be if you've lived in the real world
you know that they didn't find it
because if they found the goods
wendy would have tipped us off
absolutely you would know by now that
something's coming but instead
instead of telling you that they found
something in the audit here's what she
teases
she said also other information is
coming out i can't disclose
so that's the part that made you think
oh she's got some good stuff right
she's got other information
and she's hinting at us she can't
disclose
there's no way
that she's referring to finding a bunch
of fraud
or at least enough fraud to change the
election outcome
there's no way that's what that means
what it means is
they may have moved the goal posts
it might mean
that they're trying to find a shiny
object to concentrate on so it looks
like they ought to have found something
that's what it looks like
so if i had to put money on it i'd say
they didn't find anything
or they didn't find enough
to change the result but they might try
to paint it as if maybe they did almost
sort of kind of
um
let's talk about climate change
so
uh the news is saying it's affecting
people's health
and that world leaders need to address
the climate crisis now
because we're all going to die
from the climate crisis
and why it matters so a bunch of
publications got together
to issue a joint statement to world
leaders
and apparently it's the first time so
many
independent well so many organizations
got together with the same message
so here are the ones that are saying
that the climate change is going to
cause severe
health care bad outcomes
among them are the american medical
medical association
the landsat
and the british medical journal so those
were among the many many entities that
were saying that climate change is a big
problem
how do you feel about that
because the landsat
the landsat says it's a big problem
so they're credible right
no
no they're not credible not at all
american medical association
not so much
not so much now i would say these are
not credible organizations
now that doesn't mean they're wrong
you know i'm i'm actually concerned
i think that the concern that uh climate
change could cause you know medical
problems around the world that's
something we should really worry about
because whether or not it's human-caused
or not you have you're gonna end up with
the same
health problem
so
uh yeah it's a little like exactly
somebody saying in the comments on
locals
it's a little like these 17 intel
agencies all agreeing
it's never 17 until agencies agreeing
it's a few people in one of them looked
into it and the other intel agencies
said well that guy looks competent so we
agree
that's it a few people in one
organization and then all 17 say yeah
that sounds incredible
yeah we're in
so
that's what that looks like too
all right
that
is everything i wanted to talk about
today
um
i think there were uh what was it 64
people died in hurricane ida so far
isn't that more than you expected
i think that was the number 60 something
and that's way more than i thought i
thought the number was going to be
closer to you know two to four
because didn't we have a lot of warning
i feel like we had tons of warning
so
there's something wrong with our ability
to evacuate if people are dying when we
know trouble's coming
new york was unprepared yeah that's true
i guess there were there were some
floodings that were uh hard to predict
all right
um
would you like to drone for the rolling
stones
yeah you know true story uh my drum
teacher
and i had decided that uh
charlie watts the now deceased drummer
for the stones was going to be sort of
my role model because he'd be easy
relatively easy to imitate and that
would get you started and then he dies
as soon as i pick him as my role model
he dies
all right
read the fact inconvenient facts all
right
please don't choose any more role models
oh when am i going to do an e-bike live
stream
yeah you know maybe i should just tape
my phone to my e-bike and go for a ride
would you like that
i've been waiting for the weather the
not the weather but the smoke to go down
because i can't really exercise out
outside
oh should i paint my nail
people are saying that my bruise on my
fingernail is distracting i should just
paint my nails huh
that does look pretty ugly it lasts a
year
it'll take a year for those bruises to
grow out
do i pedal yes
in california you have to pedal an
e-bike
so that it's just an assisted bicycle
otherwise it's a motorcycle and then you
have to license it
how is boo
um i don't know
i mean she seems happy but she's
different definitely
plans for a new book
just some thoughts about it i don't have
plans yet
all right that's all i got for now and i
will see you later on youtube
