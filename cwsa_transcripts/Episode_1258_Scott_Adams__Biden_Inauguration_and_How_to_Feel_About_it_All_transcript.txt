hey anybody out there
you know this is a big day it's
inauguration
and i'm not entirely sure how many of
you gonna
be on this livestream because it's the
wrong time
but better late than never wouldn't you
say
let's try youtube's having a little
trouble connecting here
we'll see if we can improve that well it
looks like periscope is outperforming
youtube today youtube's trying to
reconnect
you feel bad
you feel uh do you hear an annoying buzz
somebody said
i don't hear it all right so it looks
like
youtube's not gonna work but we don't
care about that do we
i don't think we do hey bill good to see
you all right
so i've been uh off the internet for
more than i've been on it lately because
i've been flying
so before we talk about politics let me
tell you what it's like to try to travel
during the age of cohen not easy
not easy so we christine and i tried to
squeeze in the honeymoon that we
postponed because of the coronavirus
and i am now in a uh
many many miles away from the united
states i'll tell you where i am when i
get there
i've got another plane ride and another
boat ride before i get to where i'm
going um
if you think there's some buzzing on
this uh i'm going to be ignoring
everybody who says that
so whoever says there's buzzing on here
i'm going to start blocking you okay
i can't do anything about it i plug in
the microphone i turn it on that's
that's everything i can control so
if you've got a problem with it please
sign off
because i can't fix it all right
um and youtube looks like it's not gonna
work at all so let me turn that off
boom all right so the
first thing you need to know if you're
flying is i needed to we needed to get
the cova test
before we flew those were negative and
then when you reach your destination
in this particular case um
i don't have a tan this is i'm just in
the dark i haven't even been in the sun
yet
but when you get to your destination
they hand you another kit you have to
test yourself four days later
and then to get on the plane to come
home yet another test
so i'll have three copa tests just for
one trip
and i'm actually kind of happy about it
i also saw some data that
airplanes have such good filtration
systems
that the odds of getting something on
the airplane is
basically zero so that felt pretty safe
now the problem was that i flew united
and if you've ever flown united you know
how that goes
you get there on time and then united
says the flight is delayed
because they always do and then half an
hour later they say
ah it's a it's a minor problem
you know it's a little minor problem
but half an hour and then four hours
later
which is what happened yesterday four
hours later they put you on a different
plane because they give up
but here's the funny part the thing they
were trying to fix
for over three hours was a software
problem
so the plane kept giving software errors
and they would
change things and reboot things and they
changed the card and
it would just give them new errors and
then they would fix it
and then it would give them a new set of
errors
all software now how much do you think i
wanted to get on
that airplane and be over water
for over seven hours on a plane
that had never been tested
because you can't really test the new
software when you load it you can tell
if it doesn't give you an error
but all the other things gave errors and
what was that other error about
so i would say that that was not an
ideal situation
so i did about 12 hours wearing a mask
yesterday which if you have a little
asthma like i do it's like being
waterboarded
but it's worth it once you get there
all right who wants the simultaneous sip
who wants it you do all you need is a
copper mug or a glass
a canteen no a copper mug or glass let's
see if this will be the first time i'll
try to do it by
memory in a long time a cup remember
glass
uh does anybody know how this goes
canteen
jug flask something like that anyway
simultaneous up let's do it go
so i'm in a hotel that's the just an
overnight hotel before we end up in our
actual destination
and uh so so this is a four-star hotel
but they have one employee
so the woman who works the front desk
and there's only one of them
is sort of the only person and she said
yeah nobody else here
there's no porters nobody's gonna take
your bags
just me all the restaurants are closed
no room service
so we got here at night couldn't get
food
and they have one of those situations
where you you put your room
key card in the in a little unit right
by the door
so that that's the only time the ac and
the lights come on is if you've got your
room key in it
so i walk in i put my room key in the
entire unit just falls off the wall
off the floor you know the whole front
part of it just
collapsed as soon as i put my my card in
it just falls on the floor
so i'm having a four star
uh vacation experience which
if i'm being honest closer to a two
because the coronavirus takes two stars
right off the top
but later today we will be in a much
better place i'll tell you about later
and that will be amazing uh
a chalice yes that was the other word
canteen jugger flask well i'm glad some
of you remember it
so i'm not so good at remembering things
that's why i'd never be a good actor all
right let's talk about joe biden
so i'm gonna be a little bit
non-political
if that even makes sense i'm not even
sure that's the thing maybe i should
take that back
but i'm not going to be going hard at
joe biden today
i feel like the country deserves one day
where we just say how about not today
right how about about one day we just be
americans
and i'm not celebrating you know joe
biden's victory
or joe biden i'm not celebrating that
what i am celebrating is that we have a
system
which seems unstoppable by people
which is pretty amazing the system just
grinds along
we may or may not have had an election
that
enough people think is credible but i
don't think it mattered
we ended up with some kind of
professional class
politicians that have always been in
charge except for the
the trump interlude there i don't know
that it's the end of the world
because even biden isn't going to be
able to get everything he wants
congress will still push back the public
will push back
when he tries to do things that trump
did better
it's going to be obvious and that will
limit what he can do as well
so if you look at some of the things
he's going to do
there are either trivial things or
things that maybe can't get done
so we'll have to wait to see how much
damage he could do other than the
executive orders and reversing some of
the trump stuff they didn't like
but here's the thing i feel as if
we've slipped into this place where
politics is the politics of revenge
and cancelling the legacy of the last
president
it feels like that's the game now now of
course you'd have to blame trump
trump for doing it first and so you
can't really hold
joe biden to a different standard you
know if he didn't complain when trump
did it and
tried to erase obama's legacy
it's hard to complain if biden just does
the same thing and tries to erase trump
so yeah he didn't start it and
well we you know i i gotta say uh i had
a little exchange with ian bremmer
on twitter yesterday and uh
he he made a tweet and i responded to
his tweet
saying that that trump's response to the
election
was terrible unless he was right
wouldn't you say because how you judge
trump's
insistence that the election was rigged
depends entirely
upon you knowing that it wasn't how
would you know that
how would you know it was or was not
rigged
have you ever looked at the source code
and if you did would you know what you
were looking at
i haven't and i wouldn't do i have any
personal information about the system
working perfectly or even being you know
imperfect well everything's imperfect
but i don't have any specific
proof of fraud or not but i also don't
have any
any reason to believe that it was fair
so this is the part that i would
disagree with ian because he thought i
was joking
when i said well you know if trump
could be right now we're we're treating
it
as though the the system has made a
decision and i'm i'm happy with that
i'm okay that the system grinds on even
if it's imperfect
because it's better to move forward than
it is to fight forever about
you know something you thought was wrong
so i think what's good for the country
is to
move forward and then try to adjust
republicans will have another
shot at it a couple more shots and i
don't
i don't buy into the theory that the
democrats will put a lock down on the
government and
make rules changes that will put them in
power forever
i feel as if there's too much pressure
against that
and that it would be too much of an
overreach and therefore biden being a
uh the one thing you can depend on biden
is that he's a moderate
so i think if it looks like a gross
overreach
he's exactly the guy who wouldn't do it
so you might be you might have some
safety there at least as long as he's in
office
don't know how that will last but here's
the thing
how can anybody say they're sure the
election
was good just because we haven't
discovered
any specific provable fraud
does that feel like that statement could
be made
because i'm telling you i don't know
that it was fair
but i also don't know that it wasn't
fair but more importantly
how the heck would i know how could i
possibly know
so there are two there are two opinions
that i consider stupid
all right there are some opinions that
you could be wrong
but you're you're being smart it's just
that everybody gets
everybody's wrong sometimes right
so uh i feel the two
stupid positions are 100 certainty that
the election was fair
and 100 certainty that it wasn't if you
hold
either of those two positions i feel
like that's stupid
because you and i don't know how could
we
what what would we look at as just
citizens
to know that that was fair or to know
that it wasn't
now if you put odds on it i'd say that
would be reasonable
let's say you were pretty sure it was
fair and you said you know
i'll put 95 percent on it based on my
i know experience in life and things
i've seen before
if you said 95 that it was
fair or even 95 percent that it wasn't
fair i would say to you
that's probably not the percentage i
would put on it but at least you're
talking logically
you're you're acknowledging that it
can't be known
if you think it could be known i don't
think you should be in this conversation
it feels like not a reasonable position
whereas ruby friedman freeman somebody
says i think the
ruby thing is one of the uh
the most unfair things that came out of
it and i found myself defending ruby
because i watched the same video that
you didn't have to see anything even
slightly worrying
in that video if you think you did
that's probably confirmation bias
because all you saw was
the countenance of votes and the people
who know what's happening
and how vote counting worked looked at
it
every bit of it before and after all the
way through and they said
all we see is vote counting just the way
it's supposed to be done
so if you believe the ruby story that
would be the
least likely one to be true along with
the venezuela part that's least likely
the italian connection very unlikely
anything's possible but i would put a
really really really
low likelihood on any of those three
things
sony says she admitted it no she didn't
she didn't admit anything because there
wasn't anything to admit
um and wouldn't you think by now you'd
have a uh
some kind of a whistleblower don't you
think you'd have at least
one whistleblower because i think people
have
offered um large sums of money
for a whistleblower in fact you could do
that tomorrow
if somebody said all right i'll you know
let's say the
uh mike lindell the my pillow guy let's
say just
hypothetically he said i'll give you a
million dollars
for a whistleblower who has enough
information to you know
to show that there was a problem would
you get any takers
for a million dollars you don't think
there was somebody
hypothetically if somebody was involved
in
fixing an election they wouldn't take a
million dollars because i feel like they
would
and probably people would offer a
million dollars if they had the money
so uh that's another thing that's a dog
not barking so if you're looking for a
reason to believe the election was
not fraudulent the fact that no
whistleblowers have come
forward given that there would be an
enormous financial
benefit to do so that would be
somebody says and your life would be
ruined would it
would it you'd have a million dollars
how many people would take that chance
for a million dollars
if you didn't have money you know you
were just getting by
i feel like you'd take the chance for a
million dollars
you know remember you were you were
involved in a criminal activity in this
uh hypothetical situation so i don't
know that there are too many
criminals who wouldn't take a million
dollars
even if it caused them a little social
anxiety
so that's something all right
um if you've watched hey omar
uh if you've watched any of the uh
the press coverage of biden so far since
you know about the time of the
inauguration it's actually hilarious
because it's just a love letter to biden
and harris and
how wonderful harris is and her power
suits
there's even something about harris's
style
and i'm thinking to myself i really
don't think of kamala harris as a
style leader which is not an insult
because i'm not a style leader either
most people aren't
so i don't even consider that a
criticism i'm just saying
if you're gonna pick somebody to be your
style
uh you know symbol would it be kamalaris
i don't know i'm not saying she dresses
poorly
i'm just not sure it's a fashion
statement
um
so somebody says i like the buzz
all right there are too many complainers
and
not enough technology working so i'm
going to
cut it short but i just wanted to make
sure i touch bases with you today
and i will talk to you tomorrow
