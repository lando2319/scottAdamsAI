best part of your day yeah sometimes you
say to yourself
i don't know if it's going to be the
best part then you're surprised because
it is
and all you need to make this an
exceptional moment
you know the real the kind you remember
for the rest of your life
well all you need is a copper margarita
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
it might be hyperbole but if you don't
try it yourself
how will you ever know it's called the
simultaneous sip join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
yeah simultaneously here it goes go
i feel a little bit less coveted in my
system
a little bit less now for those of you
who think
i think everything's already been
invented and i'd like to
i'd like to become rich but i don't know
how
i'm going to give you a suggestion for
at least one of you
to get rich have you ever tried to find
a tripod to hold your either your phone
or your ipad if you have
you may have had the experience i've had
which is you buy one after another
and they're all made by morons here's my
latest one
and i think i've purchased maybe 15
models over the years
and they're all terrible they don't do
even the most basic thing you'd want to
do which is
oh i have an ipad i think i'll put it in
here
and you know you just pinch your finger
and your brakes
and i was just swearing at this thing
but but look at this design
just to give you an idea how many
opportunities there are in the world
somebody actually sold me this it's an
ipad stand for my other ipad and you say
to yourself well it looks pretty good
right snaps right in there holds it okay
but if i turn it around
this way it just falls over
so so you can't even you can't even turn
the uh the ipad
in the other direction or it falls over
worse yet
when you want to type on your ipad you
don't want it facing you you want it
flat and it doesn't flatten
and it doesn't stay in position all the
things that you tighten become loose
just just in the normal use of it so
i say to you if somebody can make
a stand for either an iphone or
uh or for an ipad
that actually it doesn't even have to be
great
it just has to be not terrible
that's it it just has to be not terrible
all right so there are plenty of
opportunities just look for something
that's bugging you and
make a better one so this happened to me
yesterday somebody sent me a video in
which
i guess elon musk was doing an interview
about spacex
and he was talking about the bureaucracy
within his own company i believe it was
and he mentioned that he felt like he
was living in a dilbert comic
and then it felt like he was in the
simulation
um and
just read the sign behind me
okay
uh for those of you who've got a problem
uh and i'm gonna start blocking anybody
who talks about the sound again today
so so so i looked at this video and sure
enough
elon musk was was joking that it feels
like he's living in a
dilbert comic and he's in the simulation
now my comic yesterday was about dilbert
finding out he lives in the simulation
and
it was created by a cartoonist so i
thought that was a coincidence but i
think the timing of the
interview with the comic was a
coincidence anyway
so what do you do
what do you do if somebody tells you hey
the richest man in the world just
mentioned
something you do what would be the
normal thing you would do
if you're sitting in a room with some
people some people you like
maybe your family or whatever and you
find this
out would you share it with the people
that you're with
would you say hey look here's a video of
elon musk he's talking about dilbert
and i make gilbert would you share it
because i made that mistake
and i was told that it was gross
and that my lack of humility
and my bragging my bragging was a really
bad look
now what do you think
do you think that if elon musk
mentions your work in some kind of a
positive way
that you could turn to somebody that you
know really well and say look
elon musk's talking about me would that
be
too prideful would that be bragging
or is it just something that happened
and at what point is it okay to share
uh something that happened to you with
somebody
that's close to you you know friend
family member
right and i actually got into this
absurd conversation
about whether humble people are better
than people who are not humble and i
actually
got somebody to to argue that
this person's humility made them
superior to me
and they were bragging about it that's
right
i actually convinced somebody to brag
about their humility
without acting ironic anyway
i have a hypothesis that the biggest
problem
in the world is that we think our egos
are something they're not you think your
ego is who you are
and you think you have to manage in a
certain way and that and that
uh looking looking good
to other people requires humility
i don't think there's a more wrong idea
in the world honestly
because we first of all we misinterpret
what people are doing
because if i'm showing somebody close to
me something that happened to me
i'm not always bragging
it's just something that happened to me
if you
if you're an author and your book
becomes a number one bestseller
do you mention it do you mention it
is that fair can you can you say oh my
book's a number one best seller
is it bragging or is it just what
happened
how do you uh how do you deal with it it
was a friend of mine who
uh a few years ago came into a massive
amount of money he was part of a startup
and so i think he's a billionaire now
but uh
he made hundreds of millions of dollars
on one day
when company went public and
he immediately went from you know the
average person in the neighborhood with
a job to
one of the richest people you'll ever
know and
and he the couple asked me for some
advice
about becoming suddenly rich and how to
how to navigate that
and it was it was fascinating to
to watch the the transition and
i wonder yeah it's not really bragging
if it's true it's just something that
happened
and i i i gave them
some advice i said nobody's going to
want to hear your good news because it's
going to sound like bragging
and it's just going to be really gross
to people
so simply talking about your day
is no longer fair because this is
something i learned when
when dilbert took off and in my life
went from ordinary to
not ordinary anymore if i simply talked
about my day
it was kind of gross to people because
it would be
you know better than an average day and
so i would i would teach him
say you're gonna have to be a huge phony
so that people can put up with you and
the way you're gonna have to be a huge
phony is by pretending that you're
having bad luck all the time
because if you don't nobody's even going
to want to spend a minute with you after
a while
they're just going to be really grossed
out by your relative success
and so i said keep track of anything bad
that happens to you during the day
and make that your story if you get
together with people say oh my god i
just
got out of my car and stepped in a big
pile of dog
and i had to walk into a meeting and had
dog on my
shoe and i couldn't get it off that's
the story
the story you don't want to tell is how
you were shopping for a private jet
because that happened too same day i've
never
shopped for a private jet this is
somebody else
i thought you can't talk about the
private jet you can't talk about that
part but it's just what you did it
wasn't your fault
it's just what you did it wasn't
bragging
all right so i think people need to
figure out that their ego
is not who they are once you realize
that your ego
is your enemy and not who you are
the thing to be protected then you're
free
if you can't learn to embarrass yourself
in front of other people you are a
prisoner
forget about your covid passport or your
vaccine passport
if the only things you can do in your
life are the things you think will look
good to other people because you you
need to look humble
and you need you need to make sure other
people are having a good feeling about
you all the time
if that's the world you live in you're
in a prison it's just a prison that you
created yourself and your ego
is what's keeping you there you need to
break free of that your ego is your
jailer
it's not your friend it's your jailer
get rid of it
all right mask
resistance for me started yesterday
uh for those of you who are new to me
um i thought masks work a little bit
and i thought they were worth trying at
various times during the pandemic it
made sense
made sense to give it a try given that
the mass of
scientists think they make some
difference but we're well beyond that
point
i'm fully vaccinated and yes i know i
can still get it yes i know i can still
transmit it
but i don't think mass
makes sense anymore in a world where you
can get vaccinated and drive your risk
down to
microscopic now i've told you what i
plan to do
which is i plan to go into california
businesses
without my mask and i plan to make them
ask me to put it on
and when they do i'm gonna be very
polite and very compliant
so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna pick a
fight with a person who's just trying to
do a job
right it's not their fault that they
have to do this
i'm just going to wear them down and if
enough people do it
then we can return power to the people
and take it away from the government in
this particular case
because they're making the wrong
decision now the reason the government's
making the wrong decision in my opinion
is that they're the wrong entity to make
the decision
the government has to drive death down
to zero if they can do it
human beings have to live we have to
live and that means making choices about
risks and stuff all the time
so the government unfortunately for this
specific
decision there it's just the wrong
entity
and we have to take that back and the
way to do it is just by your actions so
i'll give you my
experience yesterday first experience
was a retail store
big chain uh
did not wear my mask shopped as long as
i wanted
around people who were fully masked and
paid for the goods
and nobody ever asked me to put a mask
on
now the retail store you sort of you're
in the store
before anybody notices you you're sort
of already in there
but then i then went to a restaurant at
night a fine dining restaurant
and the uh yeah i'm not going to give
the name of the store because i don't
think that's fair at this point
and i went to a fine dining restaurant
also without a mask
and the host reminded us that
mask mandates are back in place and we
had to wear a mask
and i of course complying saying oh oh
uh i have i think i have one in the car
but they offered one at the
host stand so we we just took their
masks
and i said just the clarification we
don't need the masks at the table right
he said that's correct you don't need
the mask at the table
and i said and i'm just going to put on
this mask and i'm going to walk right
over there right
like right over there so i need the mask
just to walk over there and take it off
he looked at me and he said yes
yeah i needed the mask to walk 10 feet
in the same space that i was going to
take the mask off for the rest of the
meal
so i did that i put in the mask for 10
feet
and then i took it off now i think
if enough people do what i'm doing
which is being nice and polite to the
people because it's not their fault
and just making it a little bit harder
they will give up
wear them down they will give up
they will guaranteed they will give up
you just have to keep on it
but be polite all right apparently uh
china is having a problem in wuhan
with the worst outbreak of covid in a
long time i guess the delta variant is
ripping through
well not ripping through but they they
definitely are worried
and they're closing travel and they're
they're getting really uh
aggressive again and i don't know if
i've mentioned to you
that china's in big trouble there
there's some really big problems coming
now there are a lot of them it's almost
you can't even
it's hard to even think of all the
problems that are coming for china
china's got a big big problem coming
a big set of problems let's say but
among those problems is this
it's beginning to look as peter navarro
has been saying for a while
that china knew about the virus in
september
but didn't tell us until decemberish
meaning that we had a few months we
could have prepared but we didn't
and my and peter navarro thinks it may
have you know saved
or cost us hundreds of thousands of
deaths
that's just in this country now suppose
that's confirmed
and or at least people come to believe
it
how are you going to feel about china
and what happens when your country
let's say a not an ally of china
let's say your country gets all
vaccinated and it looks like there's not
much that can hurt you
you know yes people with vaccinations
can go still get it and spread it but
it's a different kind of problem in that
case
but let's say um
and let's say
that uh here i'm gonna get rid of you
where are you all right
sorry can't find you to get rid of you
right now
um so
so let's say that the world comes to
hate
china in a way that they've never hated
them before
really comes to blame them for the flu
and the virus
what happens when china is not fully
vaccinated and they're
still very vulnerable and you have all
these other countries
who really really hate china
do you think that there would be any
intelligence agency
and or individual who would
intentionally affect
in fact china to pay them back
i bet you've never heard that thought
have you
i bet you never heard that thought it's
a big world
billions of people if i said to you look
around your room is there anybody
in the room who would be willing to
intentionally
infect a country and cause i don't know
millions of deaths
you'd say god no there's nobody in my
room i don't know anybody would do that
and if you asked a hundred people do you
think you could find anybody who would
say yeah let's kill millions of people
innocent people just for revenge against
the wrong people because it was the
government who did it not the people
so almost nobody would would make that
choice right
but it's a big world somebody's going to
do it
somebody is going to reintroduce the
delta variant into china intentionally
for payback because it's a big world and
there's somebody who would do that
somebody is going to have the means to
do it and somebody's going to do it
one way or another so i don't think that
china
ever had a chance of escaping something
really really bad
could be karma it could be something
else
but
that's the situation so i think that
china
is has a gigantic coveted problem ahead
of them
at about the same time other countries
such as the united states
will be getting things under control and
that's just one problem
they're going to lose their
manufacturing base as that gets moved
out
it's it's clear that they're not safe
for business anymore
so people in the business world are no
longer going to make
decisions to do business with china in
the same way they did
because if it goes wrong now you can't
say you weren't warned
you know 10 years ago if you did
business in china and something didn't
go well
you'd say well it was worth a shot you
know nothing
nothing is 100 didn't work out but you
wouldn't lose your job you wouldn't look
like an idiot
but today today if you started business
in china
let's say you weren't doing business
there already and you started to do
business
and it didn't go well could you blame
anybody else
could you say you didn't know could you
say i didn't know
china wasn't safe to do business then
now you know
so i don't think china has much of a
good future ahead of them at least for
the near term uh the funniest thing in
the news
was and of course it's based on a
horrible event
as old news is but uh
governor cuomo denying
the charges against him the independent
commission said that
and i quote we the investigators
appointed to conduct it blah blah
conclude that the governor engaged in
conduct constituting
sexual harassment under federal and new
york state law
and then later i believe they said it
was part of a
a clear pattern so it wasn't a one-off
now the funny part about this
if there's any funny anything funny
about massive sexual harassment
which isn't funny but there is a funny
part
which is that for governor cuomo to
defend himself against these charges
this is almost so delicious it's not
going to get out of my mouth
because it'll be so delicious as i'm
starting to say it
that i'll want to like suck it back into
my mouth to taste it again
so the first time i try to say this it
might not come out i might i might just
have to absorb it back in and get a
second taste
but i'll try
in order to defend himself
governor cuomo is going to have to
oh that's delicious he's going to have
to say the cnn is fake news
god was that as good to hear as it was
to say
i hope you enjoyed that as much as i did
and indeed he's doing that now the way
he says it is that the facts are much
different from what has been portrayed
the facts are much different from what
has been portrayed
fake news cnn
now to their credit cnn is reporting
this straight
they're not ignoring it going right at
it
so i give them credit where credit is
due right they're going right at it
now you could argue they could do it a
little differently or whatever but
they're not ignoring it and
and uh their pundits are going at it
hard and that's fine
um but who do we believe do we believe
the independent commission
with their fact pattern and all of their
uh all their testimonies and whatnot or
do we believe governor cuomo
who says the facts are much different
from what has been portrayed well as
luck would have it
if you were a member of the locals
community
you saw a video recently in which a cia
xcia person described their technique
for determining
who's lying it's an actual technique
a little checklist to determine who's
lying
and let's look at governor cuomo's
denials and see if it hits anything on
the checklist
for the cia to show that you're lying
well it turns out there is here's
exactly what
cuomo said he said i want you to know
quote i never touched anyone
inappropriately
or made inappropriate sexual advances
which rule does this violate
and therefore show you that is lying it
doesn't prove it by itself
part of uh part of what the cia teaches
is that you need a cluster of lies
so if you see one independently or one
tell for a lie independently it doesn't
mean it's necessarily a lie so you look
for more of them
thank you over specificity that is
correct
it is an over specific denial
because he's using the word
inappropriate both for the
advances and for the touching now that's
a subjective word is it not
when you say that what is inappropriate
to one person would be
maybe appropriate to another person so
he's
he's staying solidly in the opinion
category
his own opinion that it was appropriate
but did he ever be was he ever accused
of quote
inappropriate behavior no he was never
accused of
inappropriate behavior he was accused of
illegal behavior illegal behavior
as in constituting sexual harassment
under federal and new york state law
so the accusation and the denial
don't quite line up do they
here's what a denial should have been
an honest denial would be i've been
accused of breaking the laws on sexual
harassment under federal and new york
state laws
i did not do anything that violates the
law
then you then you explain what you mean
but when he comes at it with a different
defense than the accusation yeah you
could argue
inappropriate covers
illegal but i don't know
does it because one's an opinion and
one's
a legal standard and even though there's
some subjectivity in the legal standard
it doesn't feel like he addressed it the
accusation doesn't
right so i would say that is lying like
now of course he's a professional
politician so he'd do a better job of
covering up his other tells
but the one thing we know is that
there's one tell there that's glaring
but according to the cia in order to be
judged a liar
you would need more of them so one is
not conclusive
you just learned something today um
as i watch my number of subscribers
on locals so people have to pay to be on
the locals platform where they get
extra stuff from me that is usually too
provocative to put in the public domain
and i've been watching my subscription
numbers
drop like a rock and the reasons people
are telling me
with quite good feedback they're saying
that
i talk too much about masks and
vaccinations
which i cop to um by the way
the other thing i get that i am most
let's see the other thing that i'm most
accused of is never admitting i'm wrong
have any of you ever done that have you
ever accused me of never admitting i'm
wrong
um well here i am admitting i'm wrong
and so i'm going to take the advice of
the of the audience who says i talk too
much
about those things because i definitely
do now what i tried to do is
talk about them from a risk management
perspective and only if there's
something new
but you end up having to in order to
talk about anything new
you end up having to sort of you know
set the stage and then you're talking
about the old stuff again
and i'm pretty sick of it myself pretty
sick of it myself
and so i want to minimize it or put it
at the end of the show so you can turn
it off if you don't like it
but i do think that talking about
persuasion
is always useful so i'm going to try to
teach you something about persuasion
i'll i'll use the i'll use a case of
something that you're familiar with
but it's not really about vaccinations
is about persuasion
now i believe that persuading on the
subjective vaccination is probably
unethical which is why i don't do it
directly
people say i'm indirectly persuading but
directly i'm not intending to persuade
because i feel it's unethical because
i'm not a doctor make up your own
decisions
your risk is different
but suppose you wanted to i'm going to
teach you a lesson on
in my opinion the most effective way to
do it
this won't be done so you don't have to
worry about it don't worry about anybody
doing this
i don't think there's any chance it'll
be done and it's based on an experiment
in which people try to teach
people to save more for their retirement
and what they did was
and what it what they did was they
digitally aged
people's face and then they showed them
in the future
and then they asked them to save money
for their future self
and the people who saw themselves
digitally aged
now had a visual representation of
themselves in the future
and what do you think they did they
saved more money
because they wanted to be nice to that
guy in the future that they've now seen
they visually see them it's like a real
person now it just happens to be you
and you're nice to you so it's easy to
screw your future self and not save
enough money
because it's a stranger future you
you've never even met
literally a stranger and a concept
doesn't even exist
so as soon as you make a digital
representation it becomes real in your
mind
that there's a real me in the future and
then you act differently
almost immediately it's a pretty big
effect it doesn't get everybody
of course persuasion doesn't work that
way but it's a pretty big effect
so suppose you wanted to be completely
unethical
and persuade people to get vaccinated
how would you do it you would take a
snapchat
filter and you would you would make a
filter
that could take any picture of a person
and put them in a hospital bed with a
ventilator
dying of covet
that would do it if you see yourself
with a ventilator
dying of covid you'll treat your future
self differently
not everybody you probably get you know
10 to 20
but it's really unethical
really unethical because you would be
taking people completely out of the
domain
of rational thought you would be moving
them away from their own
opinion of you know the odds which is
different for everybody
and you would basically just scare them
you would
you would scare them into loving
themselves in the future and
an irrational thing would happen and
then they would change their behavior
very unethical but
i thought it would be useful as a lesson
oh so let's talk about the people being
forced
to give vaccinations because of
they need a passport to do something as
raul davis pointed out to me
today on twitter uh there's a reason
that will never work
do you know what it is tell me in the
comments
what is the reason it will never work in
the long run
to have vaccine passports well i'll jump
ahead
it's because not enough black people
have
vaccinated and if you require the only
vaccinated people could
shop in a store you would be
racist because black people have far
lower
rate of vaccination
is racist and it's unambiguously racist
by modern standards right you could
argue
that you don't think you should be
you could argue that you sh you think it
shouldn't be treated as racist
but it is according to our modern
standard if you make a
policy or a rule that clearly
targets one group not targets but
disadvantages one group in a really
obvious way it's just racist it's
illegal
so i don't think that passports can last
unless everybody got vaccinated as
something
closer to a similar rate that's just not
happening
all right um
so apparently americans according to
bloomberg they're talking about a poll
that said
65 percent of workers who said their
jobs could be done entirely
remotely were willing to take an average
of five percent reduction
in pay to stay at home
is that uh is that big news they take a
five percent reduction in pay to stay
home
isn't five percent about what it costs
to go to work
that's sort of what your commute cost
feels like
so it feels like they haven't really
said anything except that they'll go
where the
the money the money tells them to go
with the least amount
of effort so again does money predict
things
yes it does money predicts that people
will want to work at home just to save
money
because commuting is expensive as well
as paying the ass
so no surprise there i remember my 25
idiot rule that you do a poll on any
topic
and 25 of the people who answer will
just be idiots
it wouldn't matter how obvious the right
answer is 25
would still get the wrong answer it's
very consistent here's another one
uh so according to another poll
uh 74 percent of voters uh this is a
rasmussen it's a rasmussen poll 74
percent of voters support
photo id requirements
74 support photo id requirements to vote
means something close very close to 25
percent of the public
thinks that you should vote without
without proof that it's you
really do you think you could sit in a
room with somebody who could explain
their
theoretical and academic argument for
why you shouldn't be identified when you
vote
do you think do you think the reasons
would sound pretty good when you heard
them
25 is so consistent
you can find one quarter of the public
they can't reason their way out of
anything anything
all right let's talk about persuasion
and aoc
um aoc was throwing democrats under a
bus today
so she was or yesterday i guess she was
on jake tapper's state of the union
and said talking about uh the uh
the renter's moratorium situation
and how the the democrats completely
screwed it up
they waited too long they should have
done something they just completely
screwed up the topic and the aoc was
kind of brutal well not brutal but
she was frank she said there was frankly
a handful of conservative democrats
in the house that threatened to get on
planes rather than hold this vote
and we we have to really call spain a
spade
so she said clearly that the democrats
they're in charge and they messed up now
who does that sound like
who who is a politician
who you can think of who is persuasive
who also has
uh yeah trump
if you want to be the president of the
united states
you have to go after your own party you
have to
if you want to be a senator never go
after your own party
because you know you're just a team
player but if you want to be president
of the united states
you have to go full trump you have to
tell your own party
why it's messed up and how only you can
fix it
that's how you get the nomination first
of all but it's also how you get
everybody to
you know change to be your
your party trump turned the republican
party into his party
by criticizing it aoc
who i believe is destined to someday be
president
not not anytime too soon but i think
she's gonna have her turn in the
presidency i think it's inevitable
uh you know unless there's some scandal
that comes out that's always a
that's always a wild card but this this
is yet again
another one of those indications that
she's operating at a different level
you know you need to be able to throw
your party under the bus right in front
of them
or else you can't go further you can't
go to the presidency
um i keep asking there's this weird
thing happening where people keep saying
that i quote got a lot wrong about the
pandemic
and that i asked for examples and the
examples
are kind of crazy
and i've been trying to figure this out
and i think here's the reason i think
the reason that i trigger cognitive
dissonance more than other people
so they actually have false memories of
things i've said or done
is that my take doesn't map to the
binaries
so there's always a binary in every
topic right people say this is
absolutely true or this is absolutely
true
but they don't allow that there might be
some gray area and the binaries here
are uh that mat list max or
master vaccinations either work
or don't if they work you should use
them
if they don't work you shouldn't use
them would you say that's generally the
the binary
people say they work or they don't and
if something works you should use it and
if it doesn't work you shouldn't use it
i mean
in this in this case working means
gives you more benefits than costs but
i don't say that i don't say that so i
think that's what confuses people
i say masks totally
almost certainly work for reducing
some amount of risk but you shouldn't
use them
if you're vaccinated and if somebody
who's not vaccinated doesn't want to use
them i don't particularly care
because i'm vaccinated my risk is
microscopic
i'm dying anyway so i don't know anybody
else who has that
opinion or states it the way i do they
work
don't use them same with vaccinations or
similarly with vaccinations
my opinion which totally could be wrong
because it'll take a long time to know
for sure
but my opinion is that vaccinations at
least for people in my risk profile not
necessarily you
make sense for me and i don't recommend
that you get them
so i think both of them work
yes statistically i think the the
science is
you know more more toward them working
but i could be wrong
either them could end up not working in
the end and i'll tell you that
if it turns out that they don't work
i'll tell you that and i'll tell you i
was wrong
but i don't know anybody who has a
nuanced position where they say
yeah they work but that's not the
question the question is risk management
and
blah blah blah so i think that's what's
confusing people
is that i don't i don't belong to one of
the binaries
and so they're pretty sure that i must
be wrong about a lot of stuff
um
here's another example i tweeted that
you know uh
that if you're vaccinated it feels like
you're not in a pandemic but
if you're unvaccinated you're still the
pandemic and somebody said well you got
that wrong
you got that wrong to which i say how
can opinion be wrong
i think my opinion isn't wrong because
it's how i feel
i'm telling you how i feel i feel that
when i got vaccinated
and somebody else told me this the other
day actually
without being asked that it feels
different and it feels like you're done
with the pandemic but other people are
not
now can you criticize me for telling you
how i feel
it's just how i feel it's not right or
wrong
it's actually just how i feel
so people are taking stuff like that and
saying that i got
stuff wrong no i'm pretty sure i know
how i feel
that's all i'm talking about um
and then let me give you an example of
how a typical
claim about the pandemic goes so i asked
in a tweet i said if ivor mechtin is so
good
and we know that a number of countries
don't have enough vaccinations to take
care of
things with vaccinations shouldn't we
see some smaller countries
who have access to ivermectin because
everybody does
for the most part but maybe not
vaccinations
shouldn't we see that some of the
countries had like totally squashed
the covid just with ivormectin
and how does this conversation go
have you seen enough of these that i
don't even have to tell you what
happened next
so i said give me some examples and
and somebody did so paul collider on
twitter said
uh well first i asked why is it that
we're not hearing about these successes
and paul
offered these reasons he said major
media's largest advertiser is pharma
so that would suggest that the
vaccination makers
don't want you to know about anything
that's a low-cost solution
uh two the major media sites on the left
it's not a serious question in other
words he's saying that
the news industry is so corrupt on the
left that you couldn't expect them to
say anything about it anyway
and then three the major media sites on
the right get a lot of their traffic
from social media
so they can't say too many things about
ivory mechan on the right
either because then they won't get
traffic sent to their
their content from social media
pretty good arguments pretty good
arguments
so they do provide a reason why it could
be possible
and before you ban me youtube wait till
the end
you'll be happy in the end youtube if
you're watching me and deciding oh
got my finger on the band if if youtube
turns off
uh jump over to locals i took the
subscription wall off for this video
so if this gets banned on youtube just
go over to locals
they don't ban this stuff all right um
so so we got a reason why maybe
uh ivor beckton could be solving the
problem in some countries and we'd never
even heard hear about it because the
media
business model is corrupt could be could
be
but then i still asked for one example
and paul gave me zimbabwe
all right so here's the zimbabwe example
uh
so zimbabwe didn't have much in the way
of vaccinations
uh but i guess one some famous i guess
some politician died of covet or
something
and they decided to try ivermectin so
here's
what we know from uh from paul he says
the death rate
rose sharply in january and peaked on
the 25th as 70 deaths per day
then officials authorized the use of
hyperbectum
it was granted toward the end of january
then one month later
in february the covet death rate had
fallen to zero
well that's what i asked for right i
asked for show me one country
that didn't use vaccinations did use
ivermectin
and and just squashed the covet and
there was zimbabwe
what happened next anybody anybody
what happened next you've lived in the
world long enough
you know exactly what happened next tell
me
i'm going to see how long it takes you
in the in the cartoons to tell me
exactly what what happened next
it took about five minutes for andre's
backhouse to find the zimbabwe
death rate and show that if you showed
it like a month later
the the spike went through the roof
so zimbabwe is an example of ivecton
not working and not working hard
i mean it really didn't work according
to the
according to the death rate chart so
how many of you are surprised how many
of you are surprised
that there was a country that was held
down this is standard
showed you a graph the graph looked real
in fact the graph was real
it was a real graph it just wasn't up to
date
how many of you knew it was going to
happen that's the reason i did the tweet
it was predictable as hell now in the
comments you said
what about mexico what about india they
used ivermectin and they squashed
no they didn't no they didn't
india is spiking mexico that didn't
happen
so all of these individual cases you
think really happened
because you saw a chart didn't happen
it's either an old chart or a wrong
chart or they didn't really use
ivermectin or something
but basically the question still stands
if you believe
ivermectin works and not only just works
but like really works
like just squashes the virus if you
believe that's true
and there are countries who have tried
it
why has it never worked why's it never
worked
now again can i conclude based on this
information
that ivermectin works or doesn't work no
no
i this is the whole reason you need a
randomized control trial
peer review and and
you need to repeat it even one
randomized control
trial is not going to be as convincing
as you should you want it to be
there's a reason you do you don't just
look at a chart
and decide what works it's because it
doesn't work
you think you can do it and you can't do
you remember the part about do your own
research
don't be fooled by the powers that be do
your own research
well paul did his own research how did
it work out
he came to the opposite conclusion of
what the data says
but he did his own research so did he do
something wrong
did his own research came to the wrong
conclusion
clearly at least in zimbabwe i don't
know about the conclusion overall
so um
that's a good way to um approach these
questions about
hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or
something
the question you want to ask is not is
what's missing
here's what's missing let me give you
another one
if you're trying to decide if masks work
or don't remember i'm anti-mask
so i'm not i'm not telling you to wear a
mask but if you're trying to decide if
they work or not
here's the question you should ask not
can i find a chart that says they work
or not
because doing your own research
doesn't work it's just an illusion that
you think you can look stuff up in
complicated topics and get and get it
like the right answer
it just isn't a thing but here's a
question you should ask
there are people who do have those
skills right there are people who do
know how to look at
medical things and scientific studies
and and come up to better opinions
why is it that there's no
top medical experts at least people who
have
control of decisions in any
industrialized country
who says mass don't work why is that
is that something about that all of them
are suppressed by the system
then nowhere there's not one country
anywhere an industrialized country where
the
leadership says you know we're looking
at all the same data
and we say it doesn't work none
now i get the fact that science like
everything else
there's a herd mentality i get that
people don't want to embarrass
themselves
you know by saying the wrong thing if
everybody else is saying something else
i get all those forces that are forcing
you into the
official narrative but there are a lot
of countries
there are a lot of experts in a lot of
countries there's
nobody in any of the other countries of
let's say the industrialized countries
right the
you know the the countries that have a
serious science
um let's say uh structure
none of them not one that that stretches
my
you know just stretches my imagination
to the breaking point that you couldn't
get one
dissenter out of all those nations
because it seems like you could get a
dissenter for everything
i can't even think of any question you
couldn't get a descent on
but not masks apparently now
let me say it again someday we'll
probably know for sure
i i don't know maybe but we could know
for sure
that vaccinations worked or didn't masks
were a good idea or a bad idea
and and if i'm wrong about any of this
stuff
i don't have any problem telling you no
problem because i always approach this
stuff as a
as a risk management question right
if i look at the question of mass i
don't tell myself there's a 100
chance they work i think it's 90 chance
but nothing's 100 so if you're if you're
thinking that
i would have a problem telling you i was
wrong
um
don't worry about that i won't have that
problem
all right um
ivermectin is also low risk somebody
says
yeah i mean that's that's worthy of
consideration
um
fauci never believed basque's work in
his 80 years you're saying
well who knows
what is the definition of working good
question you know if i had to put a
number on it
without the benefit of science so it's
just everybody's
sort of guessing here if i had to put a
number on it i think the masking makes a
10
difference in the context of a pandemic
that's worth doing
especially since the 10 percent you know
quickly
volumes up because of the viral nature
of things
so here's somebody in the comments
telling me that india is in fact
a proof that ivermectin works that the
spike was
small and didn't last um
see the problem you're all looking at
the same data
and some of you are looking at the data
and say well i did my research
here it shows it works i looked at a
chart and somebody else looked at the
same
data and said well here's proof it
didn't work you're looking at the same
chart
it's just an illusion that you can do
your own research on this stuff
mass found to be three percent effective
in the cdc in two studies
look it up um those i believe
without looking it up whoever said that
the cdc says masks are three percent
effective
i believe that's um in a laboratory
setting
not in the real world setting i believe
that was the difference
so i don't know that we know in the real
world that's where i'm saying 10
um
oh is there somebody here who who has
boots on the ground in india
says it's a media illusion what is the
illusion the illusion is that ivermectin
worked
or the illusion is that it didn't work
so i don't know which what you're
referring to um
can we talk about non-covalent related
headlines well we did
and now we're done and tomorrow
we'll talk about some more things so
here's here's my
semi commitment to you you can't really
not talk about
covid i'm gonna try to minimize it
because i know it's
um i feel the same thing i did a comic
on it yesterday
we're all just dying from the repeat
story
i i just another year of the same
 questions
you know there with slight changes is
just
it's it's awful um
scott countries won't denounce mass
because type 1 versus type 2
error okay
[Music]
um let's see what else we got here for
comments before i go
says half the transmission and counties
where masks are mandated
yeah none of those studies i trust so in
on youtube comments somebody was saying
that you know the counties they had mask
requirements
had you know such and such an outcome i
don't think any of that
is conclusive but yeah it's worth
throwing in the mix
but don't assume that you can conclude
anything from that
um
uh let's see my spike observation is not
incorrect
india is still ranked 116 for infections
okay all right that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you
tomorrow and let's hope that
we have some news that's more fun
and we won't talk about the pandemic so
much
