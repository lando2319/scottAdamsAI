good morning everybody
so is there anything in the news today
that
got you
excited about coffee with scott adams
yes there there are some stories
of great interest today
we'll get into that
it's a big day for so many different
reasons
so i'd like to introduce the
simultaneous sip if there's anybody here
who has never heard of it it's the
biggest thing in the world
it accompanies the best experience
you may ever have
in your entire existence
and it's going to come up
now
and all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea steiner canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
could even be uh
you know you know
over on locals you know
wink wink could be anything
and now
get ready to enjoy
the dope meaning of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous
it happens now go
yes i understand
uh from
people who know things that today is a
thing called the super bowl
super bowl
have you all heard of that some kind of
a football event that happens once a
year
it's the sort of thing i used to care
about but for some reason watching
television just
doesn't seem to make any sense anymore
has anybody had that same experience
that over the course of the pandemic you
lost your let's say television habit
how many of you had a habit of just i'll
turn on tv you see what's on
that's completely gone because for a
long time it was nothing but repeats so
he had to stream and then he got used to
streaming services and
yeah
lost it years ago
well here is my prediction about the
super bowl
i of course have been making super bowl
predictions for many years uh probably
for 20 years in a row the press would
ask me
once a year for my super bowl prediction
they would often put together
semi-famous people's super bowl
predictions to make a story out of it
and i started making my predictions
based on whose mascot could beat the
other mascot
so far
not a bad way to predict so it seems
that we have the bengals
which would be tigers playing against
the rams
which would be
the food
that tigers eat
am i wrong about that
am i wrong that one of the mascots is
literally the food of the other mascot
i'm not wrong about that right
a ram is literally food
for the other team
so
i i'm no
betting expert
but i'm gonna go with the uh
the technique that's gotten me where i
am
i'm gonna predict that that the tigers
will eat the rams
how about that
i'm not wrong well i don't
i suppose they both have quarterbacks
and stuff like that i should know all
those things before i make a prediction
but i don't
well the trucker rebellion showing no
signs of cracking and indeed
uh canada's veterans are starting to
stream in to join the truckers
so now you have veterans
and you got your truckers
it's a very
testosteronic
kind of a divide isn't it
i ever told you my theory that
we get everything wrong about
what team people are on
and that maybe there's just a
testosterone thing
and people have high testosterone end up
on the same team
and people who don't
end up hating that team
well there's there's something about
this canadian
protest
that is strikingly
strikingly testosterone
it's very male
you know obviously there are tons of
women supporting the thing and there are
lots of women truck drivers of course
and female veterans of course of course
of course but if you look at the images
it looks like a fairly male-centric
situation i don't know if that's
important
is that important in any way
because it makes you wonder who's more
uh
effective protesting
what would be a more effective protest
an equal number of let's say moms
or
the truckers and the veterans who tend
to be mostly male
who would get the job done
i don't know
yeah kids kids are hard to beat
but if it were moms versus truckers
i'm not sure
i think i had better than moms
um
so biden and putin talked
and this leads us to the question
what the hell is going on over there
do you get the sense that we don't have
any idea what's happening with ukraine
meaning that the real story is probably
three layers three layers below the
actual story
right
let me give you a hypothesis
this entire thing is really about
hillary versus putin
that all of it
like everything everything that involves
russia poking us or us poking russia is
all about
i believe there's a hypothesis that
when hillary was in the state department
she was trying to organize a coup
against putin can anybody give me a fact
check on that did that really happen
did or is it alleged or is it
um a known thing
did she i've seen people say yes but i
don't know what's a conspiracy theory
and what's real anymore
and
don't you think that putin would have to
respond to that
and maybe the if he did any
election shenanigans as alleged maybe
that could have been it
but it's looking a lot like
some kind of a personal thing between
hillary and putin and by personal i mean
only one of them will
will be there in the end
i mean i think he's trying to take her
out as quickly as she's trying to take
him out directly or indirectly
now here's the other filter on this so
one filter is it's a personal vendetta
between two people
and they have enough weight that they
can make two countries fight do you
remember when
george
bush jr
was thinking about going to war in iraq
and people said
wait a minute that looks kind of
personal
because saddam saddam hussein
allegedly tried to assassinate his
father
do you think that anybody would get
tough with somebody who allegedly tried
to kill their father
probably it probably makes a difference
i mean we're all humans right you're
supposed to not put that in your
judgment if you're president but
seriously
if somebody tries to kill a family
member
they have a specific
specific kind of method to do it
i think you would go pretty hard on them
and
so i don't think you can rule out
personal vendettas from any of this now
here's the other filter
who makes money
if putin attacks ukraine
who makes money
well i would say arms dealers
right
because that would cause a new flurry of
purchases by nato
and anybody who cared
so is it a coincidence that as
afghanistan winds down
ukraine winds up
so one filter on this is that all of the
news is fake and all of our
international dealings are fake and
they're all orchestrated by arms dealers
who have enough clout
to control the news
and have enough clout to cause a war
because it's good for business
now who else could financially benefit
because remember following the money is
a pretty good way to figure stuff out
who else could financially benefit
well
i feel as if this would be good for
american energy companies
am i right
wouldn't american energy companies do
better
if russia is degraded as an energy
competitor
now of course we have a distance problem
i don't know exactly how that plays into
the economics
except that it's more expensive
obviously
so it seems to me that the united states
and i need a fact check on this
if the united states doesn't get
involved militarily which is likely
and if russia spends a ton of their
money trying to invade and occupy it's
really expensive
and that causes the united states and
biden to be able to say okay your your
pipeline deal the nordstream 2 is dead
and by the way we'll be picking up the
slack by selling
selling our own natural gas and whatnot
to germany
i guess we need tankers to do that
now
russia would presumably if they get sort
of shut out by the west because if if
putin
invades he becomes hitler right
am i right from the perspective of the
europeans and the germans in particular
if putin invades a country with an army
he becomes hitler
you don't shake that off
and i don't believe that germany could
ever do business with him at that point
and it wouldn't matter what the
economics were
am i wrong
i i think that once putin becomes hitler
like actually literally acts like him in
the not just the analogy way but
actually doing hitler's stuff invading
the country
um
yeah i think it's tougher for him to
sell stuff
so what would happen if putin then said
as i've seen some analysts say well
he'll just take his business to china
because china has an insatiable demand
for oil
do you think that putin wants to have
one major customer
and and it be china
what would be the worst possible thing
for a producer of energy
the worst possible thing is to have one
big customer
who's even bigger than you are
it's a problem you don't want one
country to be able to turn off your
economy if they want now it would hurt
their own economy of course
but um
yeah you know i don't think
it seems to me that
putin would not want
too much
chinese control over russia
you know directly or indirectly
so that's the problem so it seems to me
that at least one possibility here is
that biden is literally
tricking putin into attacking
meaning he's talking tough
but the talking tough is only because he
wants the consequences
in other words biden might have
calculated or the administration might
have calculated that a
getting rid of this corrupt regime could
solve a lot of problems
you know right now we have a ukraine
problem
and a russia problem wouldn't you say
and they're two separate problems
one is why do we keep
getting
why why do we keep having ukrainian
issues with american politics
so as long as ukraine exists as an
independent corrupt country
it's going to look like everybody's
money laundering
place they go to do bad stuff right
so from the democrat perspective it just
looks like a giant money laundering
country
and if it gets sucked up
by russia
then
don't we just have one problem
so now we have two problems ukraine
keeps creating domestic problems in the
united states and then russia is always
you know a big competitor
but if russia eats ukraine
we're down to one problem
just russia
right because you just have one entity
to deal with and the rest is just a
puppet now of course i'm oversimplifying
everything right
i don't think that this story
is about one of these interpretations
do you
i don't think one in one frame or one
interpretation
gets anywhere near explaining what's
going on i think it's the the best
explanation is a whole bunch of
competing interests
that all have their own little story
and then the little stories
somehow sum up to something that nobody
can quite understand
because there are too many people with
their individual stories of course the
arms dealers are involved of course
there
of course
there are secrets in ukraine that
probably somebody's interested in
hiding or
something
of course there are you know probably
some personal feelings between the
clintons and
and putin of course there are historical
russian
um
let's say part of the psychology that
they should have control over the
neighboring countries
of course
so all of those things are in there but
i don't
know um i don't know which are the big
variables maybe some are bigger than
others here's the mystery that
i think is the most interesting part of
this
so the president of ukraine mr zelinski
has said that if western powers had any
firm evidence of an impending invasion
he had yet to see it
how do you explain that
how do you explain that the person most
at risk
is saying i don't know settle down
i haven't seen any evidence of a
invasion
here's what is missing the dog barking
right this bark you should be hearing
all the time but you're not
we've heard that a hundred thousand
troops are amassed on the border
but
don't you think we could tell the
difference between an invasion force
and
something that's not an invasion force
let's say a bluff
don't you think we could tell
because here's my assumption
a real invasion force would be
prohibitively expensive unless you were
actually going to invade
so there's an assumption that might be
wrong but that's my operating assumption
that an actual invasion force
would be so expensive
to have it just sitting there idling
next to the border
that you just wouldn't do it
if you could bluff instead
if your intention was to bluff you
wouldn't put a real force there you'd
put something that's
in the direction of a real force
something that would be scary enough
but not not that expensive
and maybe something that doesn't show
all of your capabilities too
because you don't want to give away any
secrets
so where is all the discussion about the
nature and composition of their forces
and whether this is a legitimate
invasion force
or would they have to quickly supplement
it and how quickly could they do that
maybe it's only a difference of you know
a week
between what they have and what they
need for a full invasion might not take
that long
but we should be talking about that
right
should we not be seeing a story every
day in every platform
that says oh it looks like they brought
in the
they brought in the xyz tanks or
whatever that means it's on
we should be seeing that we're not
which suggests
that maybe ukraine hasn't seen it either
and maybe mr zelinski
is telling the actual literal truth that
he's seen no evidence of an invasion
impending invasion
do you think that all of our news
entities would lie to us so badly
and tell us a story
that let's say the biden administration
and other entities maybe
wanted us to believe that war is
imminent
could all of the platforms be
essentially in on it
or fooled i guess they could be fooled
or they could be in on it either one we
wouldn't know the difference
but
there is something really really sketchy
about this whole situation
and until i hear an explanation of why
ukraine itself
isn't worried and apparently
some of the other european countries are
just business as usual
and ukraine itself the cities are like
you know maybe we should prep or
something
i feel like we should get some canned
goods
but
let's go party
so if ukraine isn't worried
it's almost as if they know it's a bluff
all right
i see smart people uh saying that the
attack is just obviously going to happen
or we're either going to give them
control or they're going to attack but
the putin is definitely going to get
ukraine
how many of you think that's true
based on what you know as of today
how many of you think that they're
they're going to take ukraine
i think on locals i may have influenced
you too much
i i worry that
i worry that i may have influenced you
too much
interesting though i'm saying mostly
no's
so most of you don't think that an
invasion is coming
but you do know that the press is trying
to make you think there's one right
how many of you are thinking it's a wag
the dog situation
that there's something going on here
that's so amazingly sketchy
that you just can't believe anything you
hear
i think that's where we're at
we don't believe anything
well i don't think there's any risk of
america and russia going to war with
each other over this
um
yeah it really feels if i had to put my
money down i think that
biden knows he's in a win-win situation
and and putin's in the lose-lose
so here's biden's win-win
he either prevents
putin from coming in which makes him
look strong
or
poon comes in
and then biden says aha
you fell for my trap
effectively he wouldn't say that out
loud but then he would just shut down
russia as a viable
energy competitor
so it just looks like business to me i
mean it looks exactly like just a
business strategy
so that's my guess
so my guess is we do have all the
lingering historical personal animosity
and stuff so that that makes it a
fertile situation
but to me this looks like business
how many would buy into the
interpretation
that this is just a business move
whatever happens is all business
meaning the
energy industry the arms industry
etc
and some of you saying it's obvious
right
so i'm saying it's dementia
yeah to me it looks like business and i
if it's business i don't know that you
start firing uh bullets
uh not if you're smart because that's
rarely good for business
all right
um
that
is the story of that russia story but
are there more russia stories
yes
because there are only two things we
care about today
what what about joe rogan
and what about russia
dear god let there never be a joe rogan
russia story
please please democrats do not start
another phony rumor
about you know joe rogan being a russian
asset
because i'm surprised that hasn't
happened yet
i'm pretty sure i've been accused of
being a russian asset
is there anybody else here who's been
accused of being a russian asset
i've been accused in public
yeah everyone on fox i guess
so
um
have you heard about the big news today
so
um
there's a story about
the
the durham investigation
discovered that the hillary clinton
campaign
had been paying some lawyers
to
invent
i'm going to say invent
even though that's not exactly
exactly an evidence
but it looks like it it looks like that
is the case to go find a way to tie
trump to russia
and they found detect their lawyers
worked with a tech company they had
access to some
not only white house data but some data
on some servers in trump tower
i don't know how the same entity had
access to both them
so that part of the story i don't quite
understand
but
apparently they
found some
complete bogus
data
that made it seem as if
trump had been making some secret
contacts
with russia or a russian bank that was
you know connected to the kremlin
and apparently the evidence that they
used is completely bogus it's just
something that you would see in a
database it's been there since 2014
since well before trump so whatever the
data actually means
there's no evidence has anything to do
with trump and russia
but
at least one lawyer i think lied about
it to the durham
folks and he's in trouble
and
it looks like the campaign was
definitely involved in something that
looks like
an insurrection
because not only did they do this
activity before
the election
they did it after trump was in office
they were still spying on him
through this method
they were spying on the you know his
communication traffic
even through the point where he was in
the in office now keep in mind this
wasn't an fbi investigation right
this was some lawyers who had some
access to some technology guys who had
some access to some data
this is about the most illegal thing
you've ever heard of
you know we've been five years of
hearing that everything's worse than
watergate
as joel pollock pointed out when the
story broke
this is actually the first one that's
literally worse than watergate
it's bigger
it happened not only during a an
election cycle but it happened after the
president was sitting in office
yeah and part of the story as uh jack
possabic has pointed out on twitter
is that
jake sullivan
who you all know from the current
administration
was uh
was deeply involved in all this
and mark elias was part of it and that
law firm and
basically everything that was your worst
imagination of what was happening
seems to be coming true
now i'm going to say something that
might get me in trouble here so i want
to be really careful
this is a joke
the next thing that comes out of my uh
mouth
is a joke
as far as you know
just a joke
at the current rate we're two weeks away
from finding that pizzagate was totally
real just a joke
just i swear
i swear it's just a joke no no no please
don't censor me
oh
just kidding
barely
so
here are the interesting parts of this
story besides everything
how many times does tucker carlson have
to be right
in the most unusual prediction
i've heard in years
which is that everything that the
democrats accuse you of doing is exactly
what they're doing
like right now
now
tucker has been saying that for several
years
and every time i heard it i would i
would just hurrumph to myself in private
like
that's just some kind of weird pattern
recognition thing
that it just feels like it but there's
there's nothing to it right there's no
there's no there's nothing that causes
that to be true
but
there is absolutely something that
causes that to be true
as i think about it more
and it's the fact that if they accuse
you first of the thing they're doing
they can do that thing
and then when they get caught
which is happening right now
the durham investigation catching the
hillary clinton connection to this
insurrection you could call it
so once they get caught
because they've created such an imposing
narrative that it's trump who is doing
the bad stuff
you can't see it
you become cognitively blind to one of
the biggest crimes ever
and if you look at how cnn is covering
it
have you checked cnn's
homepage today
biggest story in a long time
it's not there
i don't mean that it's
a small little piece in the bottom right
i mean it's not there
it's not there
so i went over to msnbc
because at the very least we should have
a story about how
fox news has a fake news story
because you know they love those right
whenever they think fox is getting
something wrong
they'll do the story about how fox news
is wrong about a story
so they at least they would be killing
the story
if it were fake
but it's the durham report so they're
not going to say it's fake it's pretty
tough to say that's fake
so what do they do both msnbc and cnn so
far as of just before i came on here
they're actually ignoring the story
and they can get away with this
because the democrats will never look
anywhere else and if they did they
wouldn't believe what they saw
so the mainstream media
is able
thanks to this always blaming the other
side of whatever you're doing
it creates this great cognitive
distortion
that you can't even see it when the
other side does it when the democrats do
it's just invisible
and then the news doesn't cover it
and they can actually make it disappear
they're disappearing on a gigantic story
successfully
absolutely successfully
it's mind-boggling
um
i was hoping that
they would get their cnn would get their
crack team to talk about this
what i think could be called
legitimately a hillary clinton
insurrection against the government
um
and i was hoping that they could
get jeffrey tubin to handle the
insurrection
because he's pretty good at handling
insurrections
so what does uh cnn talk about when the
biggest news in the world or the country
i guess
uh is something that they don't want to
talk about well here's an example a big
opinion piece
uh and i'm not even going to tell you
the name of the author because it's just
an idiot and you don't you don't need to
know
this is the dumbest thing i've seen in a
long time
this article said that joe rogan using
the n-word
which i remind you
his use of the n-word although there was
multiple uses was talking about the use
of the n-word
that's always left out of the story
if you say somebody used the n-word
multiple times
don't you assume they used it in the
you know the worst possible way
you do right
but if i told you well he never used it
in
the way of insulting somebody only used
it in talking about it
whole different story completely
different but but to cnn they can get
some action out of this story so they
say joe rogan using the n-word without
being canceled destroys uh
basically said it destroys the fabric of
the civilization that's holding things
together
so this this writer believes
that the prohibition in which white
people can't use the n-word
is such an important part
of the fabric of holding our
civilization together
that when joe rogan got away without
being canceled
it was similar similar to the january 6
insurrection
in which both of them are tearing apart
the fabric of the country
that's actually on cnn's page today
but not
the biggest news in the country
now did you think cnn could get worse
i guess so
now i'll tell you what's going to be
interesting
don't you assume the cnn you know the at
least the hosts and the news people
they're not all the same
right would you agree there must be a
variety of opinions there
i don't think jake tapper can go through
today without mentioning this story what
do you think
right you know jake and i have had our
differences
but i do respect him in a lot of ways
and i don't think
no matter what his management is telling
him i don't think he can not mention the
story
so i'm going to put that
put that little prediction out there
it's entirely possible that you're not
going to hear anything from don lemon
right
but
i think jake is going to talk about it
i think you will
so i have confidence that he will handle
this as a professional
no matter what
no matter what's happening in the air
so
maybe i'm wrong
you know if you want to take the other
side of that bat
go ahead
but i'm going to bet on him mentioning
it today how many of you think i'm wrong
uh many of you think i'm wrong good i
like it when you think i'm wrong
now
here's a question that i actually wonder
did cnn have a meeting today in which
they legitimately talked about how to
not cover the news
because i think that probably happened
like actually literally
i think the most
trusted name and news cnn as they like
to call themselves i'll bet
i mean i don't know i have no way to
prove it
but i'll bet you they had an actual
meeting probably you phone related zoom
or something but i'll bet they had an
actual meeting
to talk about how not to talk about the
news
that's a news
organization i'm not making that up i
mean i'm speculating so i guess i am
making it up
but i'm pretty sure something like that
had to happen
wow
um
so you got that going on
um and then the cnn is also trying to
talk up as are the trolls on twitter by
the way did you notice how quiet the
trolls got
you know the professional paid trolls
that have been jumping on us lately
did you notice that on this story
all they have
is that trump
mishandled some documents
by taking some home that were by the way
i assume
already digitally copied
am i wrong
do you think that there's any document
that goes into the white house that
doesn't get digitally copied before it's
handed to the president
i don't think the president sees it
before it's digitally copied
right
don't you assume because i guess trump
had a habit of like ripping up things
after he was done with them so of course
of course it was digitally copied so
they're making this big story about how
it's illegal and it might be
i mean it might actually be illegal
but in terms of the size of the crime
is it
the biggest crime in the world
that
trump would want to keep his kim jong-un
love letters
when you know the digital copies were
part of the record anyway
so i'm not dead i can't defend trump on
this and i don't know why
or even if he was involved in the
decision to keep him at mar-a-lago so we
don't know enough about it but i won't
defend it
it just doesn't seem like a big deal
and then there's a story about him
continually flushing documents down the
toilet which he denies
all right who do you believe
do you believe that trump
would rip documents up and walk them
into the toilet and flush him
or do you think he would rip them up and
leave him on his desk or in the trash
i mean maybe he was reading in there i
don't know
i don't know
you know the the only situation i can
imagine is if he had some uh
he had some confidential document he
didn't want to deal with it
he's like i just flush this freaking
thing
yeah i i don't uh i don't think that
story is real because it you know what
it reminds you of
what's it remind you of
it's a little too much
you know steel dossier
and the prostitute's bed sort of thing
the prostitutes in the bed um
yeah it just sounds fake i don't believe
the flushing story at all i do believe
there might might have been one document
one time that ended up in the toilet or
something like that but i don't think it
was like some regular thing he did
um trump made a statement
about the breaking news about the
hillary campaign
digging up some dirt
um
he goes greater in scope and magnitude
than the watergate
do you know who hasn't been on tv lately
carl bernstein
carl is the one they dragged down to cnn
did every time they needed somebody to
literally say it's worse than watergate
he became the worst than watergay guy
carl do you think it's worse than a
watergate oh yeah oh yeah
way worse than watergate
now none of that was actually real
but now we have something that actually
is literally
by any objective standard
well documented because it's coming from
durham
but not only is it well documented to be
true
it is literally worse than watergate
because it included not only the
you know watergate was only during the
campaign right
it wasn't after the
opponent became actual president of the
united states
it's worse
you know it's bad enough
before somebody gets elected but if
you're still doing it after they got
elected
oh that's worse than watergate
fairly
and i don't think that that requires
much of a subjective judgment does it
does that even sound like a subjective
judgment
to say that if if one crime was stealing
some stuff information really
uh you know before an election
that somebody who was spying on you
before an election and after
would be worse
right
well i don't feel there's any
subjectivity in that at all that's
almost just math
so
where's carl
carl
we're calling you
i think you need to get on there and say
it's worse than watergate
we should we should start a gofundme
to get carl bernstein to come on
television
just to say whether it's worse than
watergate
he would do it for a certain amount of
money
how much do you think it would cost
think you could get uh carl bernstein
for half a million
if you started a gofundme
to get him just to say those words about
this story
i think you could get him to go for half
a million
what do you think
anyway
there is so much to this story
but we'll we'll hear more about it as as
the day goes on
uh do you think it's a coincidence that
this story dropped at the same day as
the super bowl
now there's no reason to think that
durham
would drop it at a politically you know
sensitive time or anything
but isn't it a weird coincidence
that
the one day you can guarantee you were
thinking about anything but the news and
at least in the united states the one
day
you know i mean christmas would have
been better maybe
but only barely
yeah i don't know if that's a
coincidence i don't see how it
i don't see how it would not be a
coincidence because it came from durham
if it came you know as a leak from the
democrats or something that it wouldn't
be but i don't know do the democrats
have a way to make a story
like this
timed to a certain day
do they have that capability
it's a big coincidence
all right i want to read to you um
a thread by andres beckhouse who you may
or may not know from twitter as being a
phd in economics and he's usually my
go-to for debunking other people's
claims with studies
because he's really good at looking at
his study and saying oh it's lacking
these controls or
or they they miss some logical
comparison or something like that
but he has a uh
fairly brilliant
thread
and here's here's the filter i'm going
to put on this
if you write like an economist
you end up writing like a comedian
that's my claim
if you write like an economist you also
will write like a comedian accidentally
and here's why that's true
a good economist
and someone who can write in that style
will strip out all the noise
and very cleanly and clearly and quickly
get to the essence of the point
that's what economists are good at
get get rid of all the complexity boil
it down okay it's just about employment
something like that
that's exactly the same skill that a uh
humor writer uses a humor writer takes a
complicated situation strips down all
the noise gets down to just the central
thing so when i read this
um you know even though he writes it in
a lifestyle i just want you to be
kind of listening to the content but
also keeping this recording in the back
your head
of how similar economics writing and
humor writing is
it's just a weird little
lesson about
simplicity i guess
okay so here's his thread
um
and by the way i of course i think it's
smart because i agree with it so
anything that agrees with me looks
smarter
do we agree
i think we do all right so andre says uh
in in the late stage of the pandemic the
debates and opinions are getting dumber
not smarter
as you may have noticed
i like these threw in the as you may
have noticed because we probably all
think we have
he has more vitriol more revisionism
more incitement the simple reason is
economics
interesting
let's see if he can make that case that
the reason we're getting dumber is
economics
he says covet appears less dangerous now
so it's less costly now to be wrong
okay you get that
if you said something in public that
caused somebody to do the wrong thing
you could kill him
but now you really can't
so now you can be wrong without a risk
of actually killing somebody
so in economics terms it's cheaper to be
wrong
um so andreas goes on in 2020 and 2021
there was still a fair amount of risk
that dismissing facts and scientific
views about covet
might turn out to be catastrophic
i think some of the critics felt this
sword of domicles above their heads now
they feel they can just go with whatever
they want to in economic terms the
threat goes on the risk-adjusted price
of talking nonsense has decreased
while the public is demanding more
nonsense now relative to scientific
opinion
as kovit seems manageable
new new equilibrium where more nonsense
is traded and spewed than before
this tendency away from reasoned
somewhat scientifically based views
is in part consequential
as the decision on the end of the
pandemic and measures is now more
determined by public opinion and
sentiment less by scientific approval
whether this will work out we'll see
the irony being that science alone has
first put society
has first put society into the position
where society can rely less on science
now
do you get that
so the claim is that the science was
sufficiently successful
to get us toward the end of the pandemic
the science was so successful we can now
uh ignore it basically
and that he says i guess this could be
something to complain about but it also
seems like the eternal ever recurring
fate of science
so science is kind of self-canceling
in the sense that when it succeeds
you can start ignoring it again
and might still get a good deal uh
dumber for a while the motivations now
are retroactively bending narratives
into shape and taking revenge
so we've gone from trying to keep
ourselves alive into bending narratives
and and seeking revenge
all while enjoying the protective
umbrella put up by scientific
achievement and medical effort
scientific achievement in this context
meaning all we've done to
you know scientifically address
the virus
now
uh i think that was just some great
writing
and you will find that economists
typically
are better than normal at writing
if they're good if they're good at their
jobs there's a book called free
economics that i recommend and i think
super free economics those are real good
examples of that
mike says scott you're like a son to me
well
i'd like to complain about my allowance
you're you're just not
stepping it up
uh economists like krugman yeah i don't
say economists are always right
because economists are really not you
know that much better at predicting than
anybody else's because nobody can
predict anything but even if you looked
at
krugman's writing
if you're being honest
if you're being honest
even though you disagree with krugman on
a number of things some of you do
his writing
is excellent
sorry
you know i know you if you don't like
him you want his writing to be bad but
his writing is excellent it really
is um
did someone have to turn the hot air on
so
is uh winter over where you are
in my town uh it was 77 degrees
yesterday and i'm pretty sure winter's
over already
oh it's snowing where you are sorry
well that climate change is working it's
working its magic on me
all right so here's here's a question to
close things out
how many things was trump write about
now of course depending on your politics
you're going to have very very different
opinions
but
he was right about china being the big
problem
i think he was right on border security
i don't agree with everything he says
and does on border security but compared
to what we got with biden it looked
looked better
he was right on north korea i think he
was right in the middle east
um i think he
probably could have dealt with uh putin
better because he doesn't have a any
kind of a personal history with him
um tapping the wires right he was right
there he had been spied on that is
correct
um
do you know what the one thing
now would you say he was right on
climate change
saying it was a chinese hoax
i think that's a that's an
interpretation question
because i just my
my own view he wouldn't be right if he
said the planet is not getting warmer
i don't think that would be right
but
he would be right if he said the um
the paris climate accord
was a big old joke and it was just good
for china and bad for us
that part i think is proven true
so depending on how you
interpret what he meant by a hoax if you
thought if you think the hoax was the
science part
that's one thing but if you think it was
the china part well he was right about
that he said it was a chinese hoax
he didn't say it was a
science oaks did he
if he had said it was a scientific hoax
i'd be like okay that's just
maybe not what's going on here
but by saying it's a chinese hoax he
limited the comment to something about
china
which is different from the question of
are we getting warmer
right
so i think that's an interpretation but
you can interpret that either way i
think that would be fair
yeah so the only thing that trump has
been uh wrong about
is that the elections were uh
fraudulent
because as you know
there's absolutely no
court approved evidence
no court has found
that the elections were fraudulent
but it's funny how he was right about
everything else and you know what's even
funnier
trump was right about things before he
had evidence
because he was pretty sure that his
campaign was bugged before he knew
how do you know that
have you noticed that in a lot of cases
trump guesses right
he's pretty lucky isn't he
maybe it's not luck
it if you could say one thing about
trump that even his critics would agree
with
i think they would say this
it takes one to know one
am i right
in in a variety of ways no matter what
realm you're in it kind of takes one to
no one i like to use the example of
i play tennis played a lot of tennis
so if i watch a movie in which somebody
is purportedly playing tennis well
well i can tell that that's not a real
tennis player
but maybe you can't right because it
takes one to no one if you play tennis
it's obvious oh that's just an actor
who's probably never touched a racquet
before
trump
is
probably the most accomplished
bullshitter in the world
i think trump knows
is that not fair to say
if his critics are right let's say his
critics are right about everything
just whatever's the worst view you can
make of him
wouldn't that make him
exactly the person who could spot
 the best
because
it would be his world
you know a con artist can spot a con
am i right
who would spot a khan faster than a con
artist
nobody because they'd see it right away
oh that pattern i use that pattern too
so
i i think trump has lived such a uh
a varied and interesting life that he's
seen every crime
i think he's seen every kind of
government corruption up close and
personally i think he's saying the scene
every manner of business corruption
up close and personally i think he's
seen
every just straight crime
just regular criminals doing criminal
stuff
because remember
trump is not the guy who only hangs out
with the elites
which is one of the reasons people like
him
he seems to have a genuine affection
for
just people
and so i just think he's maybe more
connected to
you know the cd underbelly of life than
most people he well let's say it this
way he's completely not insulated
about that
he's completely non-insulated from
ordinary people
you know he's he's in the taco bell just
like everybody else he's hanging with
the
you know hanging with the staff etc
now
i told you that when i visited the white
house and got to chat with him a little
while that that actually is the thing
you feel
when you're talking to him in person
and you know this is the first time at
betterment person
and the only time
you immediately feel that he's
interested in you
now about you didn't see that comment
did you if you're a trump critic
doesn't that just blow your mind
that i'm sitting in the oval office and
he had a conspicuous
a conspicuous curiosity
and a genuine like connection empathy
with me
and i was just you know guy and guy in
the office
so i'm obviously you know everything's
in a political context but
um you could really see how he would be
just maybe more connected
to what is ordinary and real than some
people might be they might be a little
more insulated
um
right if
uh somebody else is saying that they
have a friend who had the same
experience with him
yeah
when you see him in person he's just a
he's very real
you know he he's also completely aware
of the difference between what's real
and what's a show
and once you realize how aware he is of
what's the show and what's what's not
the show
it just puts you in a whole different
frame of mind about what he's about
all right
um i do not have anything else to talk
about because i think this was such an
interesting day oh i see you mentioning
trudeau
is it my imagination
or have the truckers taken down the
trudeau administration
now not yet
because he's still in power but
am i over interpreting this because i'm
not really connected to
canadian
you know public opinion
but i feel as if the truckers have ended
his political career
am i wrong
the the way he handled it was so weak
and he didn't really explain himself as
well as maybe it could have done so even
if you're on his side i think you have
to say the way he handled it wasn't
ideal
it's close but he just won a mandate
yeah i i feel like the truckers took out
his administration
but i don't know we'll find out all
right that's all for now
i'll talk to you
tomorrow
