bumbum hey everybody come on in it's
time for a coffee with Scott Adams the
most amazing and immense time of the day
it's such a special time you should have
its own day and all you need to enjoy it
to its maximum potential is not very
much really doesn't take a lot
all you need is a cover of Margar glass
a tanker chelators time they can't
injector flasks FS a little Bevin ke
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better including the damn
pandemic it's called the simultaneous
separate it happens now go you can feel
those test kits being built
even as we simp well let's talk about
all the all the news I'm I'm very amused
in a Dilbert like way have you noticed
that this whole coronavirus crisis can
easily be understood through a Dilbert
filter you know the Dilbert filter is
basically that everybody involved in any
kind of a big organization is lying and
incompetent it kind of explains
everything we've seen right because all
the experts are wrong almost
everything's been wrong and it's been
this a gigantic cluster that looks more
like a Dilbert cartoon than like a
existential threat I suppose it's both
but here's the funny part in a Dilbert
filter so the president apparently was
flirting with the idea of disbanding the
the coronavirus task force now what did
all of his critics say about that you
fool
it's too soon to disband the coronavirus
task force now was he ever going to
disband the task force or was it maybe
more of a case where those functions
would be handled better by the states of
course they would still be on the case
they would still be the expert so you
still do interviews but maybe they don't
have to meet together and give and give
some kind of a daily update because
we're probably at that stage of the
crisis or that's not so important
anymore we have lots of sources to get
the same information and frankly the
task force was giving this bad
information to half the time anyway so
were no information where they were not
really telling us the numbers in context
so was it a mistake for the president to
say yeah maybe at the end of the day
we'll just wide this down I don't think
so
this is the most ordinary thing in the
world to create something for a specific
need as you're getting close to the
point where maybe some other function is
more important you you know you off you
put those functions into other places
maybe the states but he got all this
criticism so what he does he solves it
with a Dilbert solution which is just
funny because it was a Dilbert criticism
that people would act as though they
thought disbanding this group somehow
made the I know the function go away
which of course I'm sure was never then
the point of it so so now the Trump had
apparently he announced just moments ago
that he's gonna get he's gonna keep the
task force indefinitely except he's
gonna shift his focus to safely
reopening the country in other words
he's just putting different words on it
so that's harder to complain about
because what exactly does it mean to
shift the focus
the task force I mean our dr. Burks and
dr. pouchy can to say something about
opening the economy I mean what do you
what exactly would they do differently
under the context of indefinitely
keeping the coronavirus task force open
versus just having dr. Feld she's still
working it looks a lot the same doesn't
it like what would he not answer a
question if the task force had been
disbanded was foul she just gonna go
home what was that ever the plant did
did somebody think we could ask him
questions anymore if the task force got
disbanded that the fact that Trump has
found to a Dilbert solution or whoever
advised of a Dilbert solution to a
Dilbert problem which is you just did
you just changed the name of it if the
funny thing is of a probably work like
that's what's so funny about it
the the complaint in the first place was
just people not understanding how
organizations work and you know it's
normal to distribute functions when it's
that time and instead of like giving
some kind of rational explanation like I
did well you know it's time to move
those functions into the places they can
be performed past yeah something like
that which wouldn't work nobody would
buy the truth it just comes up with
basically just reap reap refocusing I
don't know it's funny to me
so Victor David Ansen who was have a
great line I just like the way you put
this it's now something you haven't
thought of yourself but I like the way
he put it he calls the experts the
credentialed class and I thought has a
really good way to put it the
credentialed class and he says that the
credentialed class has been wrong on
masks antibody testing and quote almost
everything when it comes down to
predicting how the virus
would it affect the country now I've
been saying things like this and people
are pushing back am I wrong to say that
the experts have been more wrong than
right I mean they got the broad brush of
it right there's a virus it's novel it's
dangerous a lot of people dying I mean
if they they got the big stuff right but
almost everything in the detail from
masks from you know human to human
transmission - you know what's the R on
this how fast is it spreading do
antibodies work or not do we have enough
tests can we get enough tests I mean
just just right across the board just
wrong on just about everything now I
just have a hilarious private
conversation with someone who's let's
say someone associated more with an
anti-trump side and his explanation for
you know sort of explaining away why the
experts were wrong on so many things is
that that's how science works and that
you know you're always moving toward the
truth and I'm thinking I don't think
that's what's happened here yeah it's
one thing to say science does a lot of
testing and they're refining their
knowledge over time and you're never
quite done you know moving toward better
knowledge okay everybody gets that yeah
everybody gets that but that's not
what's happening when they told you that
it wasn't transmissible from person to
person that's not what happened when
they indicated there was enough testing
facilities you know to test our way out
there isn't
that's not what happened when they said
masks are more bad than good
none of this has to do with the the
normal progression of science you know
testing and learning and correcting
itself none of that was happening but
this was just gigantic lying and
 and confidence that's all it
was it wasn't science
except for the general sense I I ended
up in a you know I think you'll be
amused by this I don't think it would be
a surprise to you to find out that
sometimes I can be arrogant or cocky I'm
not sure there's a difference
what's the difference between cocky and
arrogance sir are those the same I guess
cocky would be not so much thinking
other people are wrong by arrogant would
be you think you're more right than
other people so I guess I'd be a little
different so I prefer to call myself
cocky you might call it arrogant I will
not I will not debate the difference
because I like to think I have at least
enough self-awareness to know I can be
cocky but but but it's also basically
the fact that I've been right you know
I'm not cocky without purpose not
without evidence for example I don't
believe I can play in the NBA right I
don't because if I if I just had some
weird belief about my powers I would
have crazy thoughts about what I could
do oh yeah I could play in the NBA no
problem but I only make a very limited
claim very limited claim this is very
limited that I have a special experience
that I didn't put together intentionally
just the the life path I talk gives me
special insight on detecting
corporate especially you know
organizational specifically now
I base this claim on being one of the
foremost authors of making fun of
 and big corporations may be the
most foremost author who has wrote the
most
on the topic a from big
organizations who's done more of that
than me in the whole world
maybe you know that doesn't make me an
expert of course it just means I've
spent the most time in that domain
thinking about it talking about it
hearing about it it said it so I'm
pretty good at detecting and if
you add on top of that training and
persuasion and just being around and you
know having a breadth of experience it's
the only thing I claim the only thing I
claim to be an unnatural ability meaning
something that you can't all do just as
well is detect and you've seen
me do it in public
over and over again President Trump
can't possibly win the election
the there's a Cuban embassy problem
there's a secret sonic weapon
Isis has claimed responsibility for the
Vegas shooting masks don't work
 so I mean you've been watching
me you've watched me called a
thousand times probably right nine
hundred times I'm exaggerating of course
but it's what I do
calling on stuff so here's the
funny story enough of this setup as
people do I got myself into a
conversation on Twitter with somebody on
the topic of the corona virus
unbeknownst to me and here's the funny
part he's a doctor all right so here's
the setup I got myself into a
conversation about who knows more about
this coronavirus situation with a doctor
but I didn't know he was a doctor I just
knew he was a guy on Twitter and I was
disagreeing with with him so how do you
think that went well it turns out that
this doctor has two beliefs that I
you should maybe look into what are
those beliefs is that it's possible that
we can test our way out of this then
we'll just we'll just ramped up our
testing really quick have enough testing
stuff test the test test test contact
tracing and once we get that all cranked
up we can go back to work nothing like
that's happening there is nothing like
that even slightly happening in the
world the number of tests we would need
to test ourselves to safety to really be
able to test all the stuff we want to
test we're not even close nor is there
any expert who will tell you that we
could be close in the coming months
we're not in the same universe of being
able to do that everybody who tells you
that that's the strategy they're lying
it's if you've been by the way
in all cases where I'm calling
you just have to show me the you know
the other case to show me the evidence
for the other side I probably would
change my mind
because wouldn't I love to think that we
could test our way out of this if
there's anything I want to be true I
mean I really really want this to be
true and I also believed it was true
only maybe I don't know a week ago if
you had asked me I would have said yeah
this is the United States of America if
if anybody knows how to make a test we
can make a lot of them and we can make
them fast were the United States and
that I learned that there are all kinds
of different tests and companies and
hundreds of them and nobody's in control
and if you were to add up the ones that
we know can be made it doesn't come
close yes bill Gates you made the same
point so in order to prove me wrong to
prove that we can ramp up to the number
of tests we need to let's say have
something done and say a month or so you
know to ramp up during May let's say if
there's anybody who believes that's a
please send me the the link I'll tweet
it out if it looks even a little bit
credible that I'll take that story
forward but good luck with that you're
not going to find these two numbers that
at least are compatible with each other
find me the number of tests that need to
be made per day in order to be able to
test our way out what is that number
those we go research that then figure
out if you can find and I don't think
you'll be able to find this the total
number of tests of the right kind that's
the other track because they're
different tests the tests that you have
to wait three days for a result as Bill
Gates points out what the hell good are
they because those three days you've
spread that you've spread it around
while you're waiting for the result etc
so you have to figure out it has to be
the right kind of test you know sort of
the the five-minute test to really get
any any kind of a foe hold so how many
of those five minute or so or less tests
are we going to crank up in the month of
May go research that how many would we
need is let me do this visually for you
this is my current understanding I want
you to fix it if I'm wrong I want to be
wrong I mean I really really want to be
wrong so please prove me wrong so my
understanding is the number of tests we
would need per day is this big for those
of you listening I'm holding my hands at
far apart my current understanding I
hope it's wrong is that the number we
will actually reasonably be able to
produce and say the next month or two
the the period we're talking about in
order to be ready to go back to work in
more of a safe way if the universe we
need is my home my hands being held far
apart the amount we can make is
something like the size of my fist not
close not close
all right and if any funnies tell you
otherwise please tell me because I've
been waiting for the crisis task force
which is useless largely in terms of
information because I don't think they
don't I don't think anybody knows here's
what I think let me put the Dilber
filter on this I believe there are
hundred or more companies involved in
testing and creating tests I believe
that the government has talked to
probably every one of them and I think
the government has said can you tell us
what you can do and maybe the government
heard big numbers and you know I don't
know if they sum them all up but maybe
they heard lots of claims do you know
what corporations claim in situations
like this where the person they're
talking to is going to write you a check
if you have any story at all and the
story of plausibility and your customer
is going to write you a gigantic
freaking check in an environment in
which making money is hard but you can
get a big frickin check from the
government and all you have to do is lie
all you have to do is say umm yeah I
think I think maybe in three weeks we
could make a million tests if you would
just write us a check now what happens
in three weeks do you think that company
says here's your million tests just like
I promised or or do you think this would
be more like I need to curse can I have
permission to curse in the morning but
is that okay are your kids still asleep
probably kids are sleeping in right I
feel like just some situations they need
a little cursing and maybe I can hold
that back I'll try to just curse the
evening could that be a better idea so
the point is that I'm almost certain
that if it's like every other situation
in the corporate world but wait back me
up I'm getting a lot of approval for
cursing all right let me give it to you
with full curse mode
hide the kids hide the kids you've been
warned it goes like this
if it's true that the government talk to
all these companies they're gonna make
us all these test kits and and all the
company said yeah we'll get you these
million test kits you know in a few
weeks we can do this
is that possible maybe could be or or
could it be that every one of these
companies that the government talked to
to get information could it be that
they're acting like every other
time they talk to anybody in the whole
 world and it goes like this
hey vender can you get me this in three
weeks yes I can all you have to do is
approve it so that it's there's no
turning back you've got to get a little
bit pregnant and then I'll definitely
get this to you in three weeks what
here's your check all right we're
starting we're going to build it we're
gonna have this that's well did I say
three weeks we'll have this in four
weeks you said three weeks yeah I know
but we just found out we've got this
problem with the factory it's not our
fault but you know four weeks tops all
right four weeks and what's the vendor
say thank you I just needed that little
flexibility because in four or five
weeks what and you say four or five
weeks what the you're talking about
I just gave you a check for three weeks
you said you'd give this to me in three
weeks
what's the vendor say yeah you know I
really meant that but I was surprised to
find out after we got your money
that there's this problem but we're
totally working on it
five weeks go by what happens
where's my goddamn product you
goddamn liar what does
your vendor say to you almost there
almost there all we need is for you to
write another check because we're gonna
need an upgrade that we didn't know you
need when we first analyzed this because
you didn't quite give us the right data
so it turns out we'll need an extra
server so we can get this to you in five
weeks tops we just need this extra check
okay you
you lied to me you lied to be you
 lied to me but I'm stuck now I
have to give you that goddamn
check because I can't go back and say
let's start over I'm five weeks into
this and I can't change it
and I'm not gonna tell my boss that I
 up all right so you need to fix
this yes yes four or five weeks we're
going to have this fixed and once we get
that check I think I can get this to you
in two months two months what the
you talking about
you said three weeks now those
of you who have worked for a big company
back me up in in the comments did I not
just describe every experience
you've ever had with every
vendor for anything that's complicated
you know if you're just buying a simple
product sure but if you're like doing an
installation here you're replacing the
whole system tell me how that goes every
 time that's how it goes not
sometimes it works out well every
 time it goes the way I just
described now multiply that by a hundred
 lying corporations who talked to
Ward dumbass gullible government
who for some reason may have believed
their and now they think that
we can make test kits like magic
because we're gonna be them out
of our asses in three weeks when nothing
like that has ever happened in the
 history of this country or the
civilization in general so if you'd like
you can believe that this is the first
time in the history of the world
corporations have accurately told the
buyer what they could deliver before
they got their money it could be the
first time it's ever happened in
civilization or maybe you put the Dilber
filter on this and say we're not going
to test our way out of this and the way
you know that
the way you know it is that the
government didn't even have the balls to
put together the estimate for us to say
this is how many we need and we're a
little embarrassed that we believe it
mm this is how much they say they're
gonna make I don't even know if I want
to put that on paper because I don't
think it's true so if you can't even get
to the point where the government will
lie to you and say we asked them
it looks like it's we got plenty I'm
gonna have this in three weeks if
they're not even willing to lie to you
about it it's not happening same with
the vaccines the vaccine story is just
complete the other thing that
this doctor that I found myself talking
to on Twitter he made the mistake of
questioning my credentials and it's
always the same problem you know the
medical people will question my
credentials and then I have to correct
them I say oh I'm sorry did it seem as
though I was offering a medical opinion
no no I'm no expert on medical stuff I'm
not gonna offer a medical opinion but if
you want to know what is
you want to come to me I will spot your
 faster than just about anybody
in my cocky yeah yeah I'm cocky about
that cuz I'm good at it I'm not cocky I
think is a bad at that would just be
crazy but I'm good at that so yeah come
to be when you want to find out what is
 so the other thing that this
doctor believed is that we could
eradicate the virus what how could you
be paying attention to this whole
coronavirus thing and think that we can
eradicate it nobody thinks that is there
any expert that thinks we can eradicate
the virus so I'm talking to a guy who
thinks I'm stupid because I don't have
enough medical information and and he's
the smart one and he thinks we're going
to test our way out of it because the
corporation
said we could okay and that the virus
could be eradicated okay
says nobody but and then he pointed out
I have a credential problem oh what's
the world coming to all right
speaking of credentials I only mentioned
this because the credentials of the
person saying it so this is a professor
of practice at Harvard and he teaches
economics all right and he's a senior
fellow so you put all that together he's
a smart guy all right now what does he
say when he looks at the coronavirus
prediction models what is someone who's
a Harvard econ professor and the senior
fellow clearly very qualified and based
on his comments you could tell he's
deeply qualified what does he say about
the about the prediction models well he
uses big words but here's one of the
things he says he says a lot but here's
a lot of the things he says the cubic
fit which isn't the method that I guess
they're using is based on an approach to
epidemiology that has long been absent
from any serious epidemic
epidemiological discussions it made
terrible predictions back in March and
April the functional form was chosen to
get the result they wanted so there's an
expert on models who's telling you
exactly what I told you but the smarter
which is that models are sort of about
manipulating perceptions you know they
can do a little bit in terms of bounding
things but it but if they if they try to
use them to convince you there's
something specific gonna happen like
we're going to follow this curve they're
not on such solid scientific ground says
this Harvard expert and I believe them
all right
oh by the way by the way so most of you
know I've started moving some content
I'm not going to be moving these
periscopes you'll still be able to see
these but in addition if you wanted to
see them on the locals platform locals
with an S com
I'm putting some special content on
there so that people who subscribed
there will get extra stuff and just
letting you know if you subscribe there
you could see my micro tutorial on
personal finance so somebody who doesn't
know anything about personal finance and
it's just a few minutes to get you
started so what I'll be doing is putting
lots of little micro lessons just a few
minutes on topics for people who just
just need to get a some traction on a
topic and then they can you know google
it and research it but I'll get you
going in ten minutes on a bunch of
topics so personal finance is the second
one the the one that was already up
there is how to write humor so those are
two I'm gonna try to do what a week
we'll see how that goes so you can see
this forming and it's already started
so here's a tweet that I said that's
based on the fact that once you rise
that the whole testing story is a fraud
that that's never going to get us where
we need to be and that there's no other
plan there there's nothing else in terms
of a plan or a technology or a solution
or anything that would get us back to
work more safely than just sort of going
back to work and trying to you know do
it as cautiously as possible and given
that that's the case that we don't have
an option where people don't die so
they're not having an option part is the
key here so remember there is no option
there's nobody smart who can say oh yeah
why don't we do this this doesn't exist
there's nobody smart offering an option
if you don't know that you're missing
the most important part of the story
because you think they are
because you're thinking yeah there's an
option we get better testing no that's
not a thing that's a fraud you're not
going to get better testing in at least
within the next several months so I
wrote this tweet which is just a
realistic assessment of the fact that we
don't have options okay so no options
here's what I said
I once demanded people give me their
acceptable death count to go back to
work in order to be deemed credible in
the conversation that makes sense right
if people are gonna die either way a
serious person is gonna say well I
choose this path because it'll be fewer
deaths than the other path but you have
to say their deaths otherwise you're not
part of the conversation and then I said
I updated that and I said today I see no
option but to accept the death toll
whatever and that comes from opening
because it is what it is so the death
toll is just going to be what it is if
we had an option to make it something
different that we should talk about that
but nobody's offered an option the only
option we've talked we've heard about
are these fake ones like let's think how
about if magic happens and then we all
have enough tests hey that's what I did
let's use magic to make enough tests
appear really quickly then we'll test
everybody and we'll go back to work
that's way better than your plan Scott
I'm just going back to work well it is
better than my plan if magic was real
but it isn't so we're not going to use
magic to create tests that don't exist
and can't exist before the economy is
destroyed so my take on this is that
there's some point at which the economy
has gone too far
meaning that you can't claw your way
back to something good that would be
catastrophic we don't know where that
point is I suspect that we can go
another three weeks in California as
long as other states that are in better
shape or whatever are beginning to open
up sooner I think California could wait
you know I don't
think we'll go I don't think it becomes
a permanent problem in three weeks but I
wouldn't say that about six weeks
meaning that I don't think anybody smart
enough to know where that you know that
crossover point is where you kill more
people by killing the economy
nobody knows where that is but we do
know conceptually that there's some
point where it happens at some point
that's just too far and I think that you
can sort of feel that more than you can
analyze it and what I feel and again
since we don't have data to be more
important or more reliable than
anybody's feeling at this point is that
the risk of taking this too far
and having not enough left of the
economy to bring it back is so big
that's such a big risk that you'd be
better off going a little bit early and
we don't have an option we have to go
back to work it's only a question of now
or wait a few weeks but nothing's really
going to change in a few weeks if there
was something happening that would
change our situation in a few weeks
such as having lots more tests release
enough or a vaccine or therapeutics or
something I'd say wait you know if we
could if there was something to wait for
I'd say wait which is also why I say it
was it was exactly the right decision to
close things down for a while so if the
if the entire closed down had been one
month I would have said I would have
said unambiguously that was the right
decision because we needed to find out
what's what and one month we can survive
it doesn't crush the economy one month
and I was saying that is like one month
we're gonna bounce back from this you
know six weeks no problem we're gonna
bounce back from six weeks and we'll be
back by the end of the year and then it
turned into well it's now six weeks it's
a lot longer now there's nobody who can
tell you what's too long but six weeks
definitely would have been short enough
that we would have been
spec I I say that with very high
confidence three months I don't know I
don't know maybe maybe not but I don't
have confidence the three months is is
we're still gonna get back from that so
let's say 200 parents our lines are
looking at options for not occupying the
center seating so there's I guess a
Frontier Airlines said that you're you
you could actually pay extra to keep the
seat next to you open so if you want to
pay extra there's nobody in the middle
seat now I don't know how that works
because if I pay extra the person on the
other side you know the the other side
of the middle seat do they get a they
get it for free I mean is that fair and
then apparently other airlines are just
without extra charge or getting rid of
these Center seats and I guess they're
all requiring that you wear masks now
and I'm thinking to myself if the only
thing that came out of this is that
people could pay extra to have a seat
with nobody in the middle seat that
would be huge
do you know one of the advantages of
being by size physically is that if I'm
flying in coach and there's nobody in
the seat next to me it's not a lot
different than the first class because
I'm not so big that the bigger seat
makes that much of a difference to me
I mean I can fit in a regular seat just
fine so if you give me the option of
flying coach would nobody in the seat
next to me and I have to say pay 20%
extra there are a lot of situations
where I'm gonna fly coach where
otherwise I might use my my dilbert
money to the fly first-class and you
know would be sort of a waste because it
might be a two hour flight or something
but for a two hour flight I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna fly first-class even if I
can afford it if I can have nobody in
the middle seat
yeah you know I'm not I'm not so rich
that I throw money away for no reason
I'd like to be that rich but I don't
know if I can ever feel that that I
could waste things all right so that's
where we're at if you take the fact that
people might be able willing to pay a
little extra for the middle seat to be
empty put it on top of that the fact
that the fact that the fuel cost should
be coming down a lot for airlines that's
going to be one of their biggest costs
if not the biggest is fuel the biggest
cost for airlines or is it something
else it's up there and then I add on top
of that that probably by year-end the
resorts are going to be offering amazing
deals because they won't be booked up
unless they do so I would expect that
you know I hear something I totally
agree with Trump on the 2021 I think
2021 is going to be off the hook because
the people who lost work were the people
who were not the big buyers to begin
with they were the people who didn't
have much money they were working the
kind of job you know where they would
lose it but they weren't driving driving
consumption because they were the people
who didn't have money the people who
still kept their job was something like
70% of the country right still got their
same paycheck and probably they're the
people who are making more than the
people who lost their jobs so all those
people who were getting extra just spent
months indoors not spending much money I
guarantee you that there are a lot of
people very quietly who had a really
good few months their personal expenses
dropped to practically you know maybe I
don't know 30 percent of what they could
have been there that's two let's say 60
percent of what they could have been
they probably saved money they're
probably at least half of this country
who saved money because they still got
paid and they didn't have anything to
spend it on so
what happens to all those people who
save money the people who have the money
when they're free to go spend it again
look at all the cars that they didn't
buy all the trips they didn't take the
clothes they didn't get the I mean
Twenty twenty one is going to be off the
hook just if we just go back to work you
know if nothing special has to happen
there is so much you know untapped
buying potential that's gonna be crazy
now of course people's 401ks and their
stocks are lower but as of today stocks
are heaven well looks like it's mixed it
was better this morning a lot of stocks
are having a good day
bitcoins up bitcoins having a good time
but it seems to me that when we get to
the point where the economy is reopening
people see that bulge of consumer demand
this coming stock market into 401ks are
going to be you know back within you
know back within let's say spitting
territory of where they were and people
are gonna feel fine so that's the good
news
all right somebody's saying that they
saved a ton yeah you know I'm this
coronavirus thing will be a big hit to
me because I think that my main source
of income will probably shrink that Oh
75 to 90% this year because I think the
small but the small newspapers will just
go out of business but if my income
stayed the same I would have also spent
much less I'm not doing anything so I
would have cabana had but I won't be
going back to a career that I used to
have a commercial real estate yeah so
somebody's saying commercial real estate
might be iffy but here's the thing the
people who have commercial real estate
probably have long-term you know mostly
deals so I all thing
Real Estate's gonna crash right away
I think that's got a little bit of
padding because people are still gonna
have to pay the rent even if a lot of
more people are staying home for another
year a year or two
isn't stock your main source of income
no no it is not and nor is it even close
anecdotally it didn't just hit poor
people in my sphere no it did not
just hit poor people but of course they
got hit the hardest killed my wife
speaking business yeah yeah anything
with travel or crowds somebody says take
the speaking engagements what speaking
engagements that what speaking
engagements do you think that I get
speaking engagements now now I'm on too
controversial at this point so I'm no
longer a a good speaker for a general
let's say a corporation event or an
industry event because as soon as they
book me because this has happened you
know I'm not guessing this has happened
they'll book me and then they'll tell
their members hey we've got this Dilbert
guy and then somebody in the membership
will say ah you know that he said good
things about Trump right and then the
organizer says I didn't know that and
then they called me and say you know we
lost our budget we can't hire you
anymore so I mean I've been through this
so no I can't do speaking that's not on
the table
nor can I make a Dilbert movie same
reason too too much you know Hollywood
be hatred so most lines of my normal
business have been closed down for me
for different reasons but I will be fine
don't worry about it somebody says you
make tons on books that's not true
actually so the books that I write are
actually a trivial part of my income I
think even the bestsellers they're
actually kind of trivial most people
don't realize that the the books that
make money
are the ones that just are just runaway
bestsellers but they make pretty much
all of the money once you get to well
you were on the bestseller list for a
few weeks you know but at the bottom and
then fell off after a few weeks if
you're that kind of author that's not a
lot of money and my early Dilbert books
were in that other category where it's
just crazy money but that was like 20
years ago
the current publishing even though I
write bestsellers they don't yeah they
don't sit at the top of the bestseller
list for five years those make money but
maybe 1% or something of books that get
published or big money makers I'm
probably in the top 5% I'm just guessing
here just off the top of my head I would
say that my books sell in the top 5% of
books fairly dependably but that's not a
lot of money in terms of you know the
big picture cartoon on TV makes no money
even though it still runs on TV because
Hollywood makes a deal where after a
while they keep all the money so that's
where that set anyway just in case you
were wondering not that it matters to
you
but I do have options so I'm not
complaining if any of this sounds like a
complaint let me clarify I have been a
much better situation than 99% of the
world I do not lose sight of that so I'm
not going to about something that
happened to me when I'm watching the
world meltdown like that's not where I'm
at but it is also just true that many of
us will be affected or a different ways
it's just the fact all right I'm poem
what's my big overhead oh well it's a
longer story living is expensive but my
my property tax is probably more than my
property tax in my house now I'm not
going to say this sounds like a dick
I'll talk to you tonight
