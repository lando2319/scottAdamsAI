[Music]
good morning everybody
welcome
to the highlight of civilization itself
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
probably the best thing you've ever
experienced and it can get better oh
yeah
amazing buddy Canton and all you need is
a copperhead chalices
Philly with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing makes everything better
except apparently the Ukraine war but
we're going to fix that later
go
ah yeah yeah yeah yep
that's exactly what I was looking for
I like to start the day with one thing
that goes perfectly
and I like to say that that went
perfectly and
again if you can take a compliment
without being too embarrassed
I think you look fabulous today
a little bit sexier than even yesterday
and yesterday was kind of a high point
so good for you whatever you're doing
keep it up I think you've been
exercising probably watching your diet
and uh and I think your hair looks
fantastic too
well in my local uh of a town
it will be the last day of masking in
schools
so let me uh
let me just put this in perspective
today all the school kids in my town
will go to school and they will all wear
masks
do you know why
they'll have mass on today because of
the science
says that that would help
over the weekend
the science will be flipping
and on Monday it'll be safe to not wear
masks
but today
God help anybody who takes their mask
off today
because that's somebody who doesn't
understand science because this science
is completely different
on a Thursday
there's no school on Friday locally so
in case you're confused about the days
so yes but uh while while today is a
dangerous dangerous day for a child it's
dangerous how their children put on your
masks but sometime around
midnight on Sunday
the science flips sort of like have you
heard that the the North and South Poles
the magnetic poles they might flip it's
exactly like that
except with all of the variables
different
that's how analogies work
and so
um
I would be really proud of any kid who
took their mask off today and said
uh are you teaching us science
or are you teaching Us Superstition
because make your argument that the
science is going to be different on
Monday Mr teacher hey Mr science teacher
can you how about this can you imagine
going into your science class in high
school
science class
take your mask off your teacher says
I'll put your mask back on you say I'd
be happy to you put it back on you say I
was just wondering since we're in
science class
would it be an appropriate task if the
science will be changing between now and
Monday
just to see what your silence teacher
says
about all the science
well um and I guess
um United Airlines is talking about
dropping vaccine mandates for employees
that's good
so I think one by one we'll see these
mandates falling away I'm not too
worried about a permanent loss of
freedom and in this country I don't
think we're going to see a
some kind of a general social credit
passport I don't think it'll happen in
this country but I don't think it I
don't think anybody needs it
because because if everybody lives
online you can kind of see everything
about anybody you want to see anyway
so I'm not sure that that would even
make a difference
so tell me am I wrong
that the media always needs some famous
person to tie to every story to give it
a little seasoning
so it doesn't matter what the the topic
is in politics or in the world
it's got to be about Trump
Joe Rogan or Elon Musk am I right
like at every C every story has to be
seasoned with a provocative uh powerful
male figure somebody that you can love
or hate
but boy that's the
that's the element you want to talk
about you got what you want to talk
about what Trump said about it or what
Joe Rogan said about it or what Elon
Musk did about it or said about it
that's what matters and we're
yeah I guess it's a just an observation
about how the the business model works
if you want clicks you got to put a
person on it let me give you one of the
most important
persuasion tips of all time are you
ready
best persuasion tip of all time
well it's right up there
uh years ago I was asked to draw
some Dilbert art to be considered and I
I emphasize to be considered for
being on the cover of Newsweek back when
Newsweek was a a big thing in a popular
magazine
and they said to me we haven't decided
if Dilbert will be undercover because
the other possibility we're looking at
is a human model
you know probably a female model who is
you know doing something and is just a
generic model being photographed doing
something that tells the story
or it would be a Dilbert comic
now do you know what I said
I said so you're asking me to completely
waste my time
and whoever I was talking to said what
right you want me to compete against a
live Human model
then they're going to do a test on it I
guess they test covers before they rent
they do a little test on it and you
think that the more people would buy a
comic
a Dilbert like Dilbert's face on the
comic you think more people would buy
that magazine than a human attractive
female might on the cover
and I said you're completely wasting my
time because you know at the time I knew
a lot about persuasion already
but because I'd worked with Newsweek
before and the people who were asking
you know I had respect for I did it
anyway
it was a complete waste of time because
they tested the two covers and the one
with the attractive female on it sold
like crazy in tests and of course that's
the one they picked
now
uh extend this to products that have
been very successful
let me give you the name of a product
that's been very successful
Facebook now called meta what made
Facebook
predictably successful
it was about faces human faces
especially female
all right it started out as almost sort
of a dating site workaround for
Zuckerberg in college
anything with faces especially female
faces
is going to be popular Instagram
faces
yeah so almost anything that's got lots
of female faces on it if you can figure
out some way to make that make sense
with your product you're going to sell
more why does Sports Illustrated have a
swimsuit model issue that doesn't even
make any sense having a swimsuit issue
with a Sports magazine like how did that
even become a thing
it's because people buy more magazines
if as a female owner that's it
so it's not an accident that these news
stories are often paired with a famous
person it might be a coincidence that
they're usually male or maybe it's
because the patriarchy or something like
that I don't know I don't know if it
matters that they're male or female it
just seems like lately they've been male
all right uh DuckDuckGo CEO
has announced that he says he's sickened
by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and at
DuckDuckGo they've been rolling out with
search updates that downrank sites
associated with Russian disinformation
now as you know DuckDuckGo is most
famous for being a
search engine alternative that doesn't
rig the results it just lets the natural
results
come out
but they're saying now that they will
rig the results if they believe that
it's for the benefit of let's say
reducing Russian disinformation about
the war in Ukraine
what do you feel about that
do you believe that any search engine
companies should ever
uh change their search results
to match their politics
seems like a mistake
now what I saw was just a tag that says
something was associated with Russian
media
which I'm okay with
are you okay with that
if they just tag you Twitter does this
too so one of the people who tweets with
me all the time Chen who I who I imagine
has some association with the Chinese
government but he denies it he denies it
um
so Jen gets a little automatic Twitter
note this as he's associated with
Chinese State media and I think
DuckDuckGo wants to do something like
that with rt Russia Today and some of
those Medias
but I don't know how you can make this
work right
I feel like as soon as you take that
first step
what do you do what do you do but like
we have a lot of problems like this
lately I was there Aaron Gutfeld saying
this yesterday about uh Ukraine you know
what do you do like I'm looking for good
ideas I don't have one nobody seems to
have one so what do you do
all right
um I'm okay with adding tags to stuff
because I think people are sophisticated
enough to deal with that but you do have
to ask yourself
isn't can't we identify media platforms
of this country
that are just telling you state run
basically the state you know program
I mean does NBC tell you Independent
News
do they or is CNN is that Independent
News or is that just State sanctioned
Democrat news or CIA news
I don't know I mean we have our
suspicions
I don't know
so I don't think there's any way you can
uh
ever really even meet the bar that you
set yourself if you're going to get rid
of state-run media or state-controlled
media how do you even Define it
I mean some of it is is clearly obvious
all right I would say the RT
is obvious
so okay but what about NBC
I would say that's obvious
but I'm not the CEO of DuckDuckGo so and
what and and what if it is obvious
can you can you start downgrading NBC
to a largely American audience of users
I don't know they might ask some
questions
um
uh I don't know what to think about the
celebrities who are saying that we
should all pay more at the gas pump and
everything will be fine if we just pay
more at the gas pump but the all-time uh
most tone deaf
and usually I wouldn't even talk about a
story like this but it's just so
outrageous so this was uh Stephen
Stephen Colbert said today the average
price today the average gas price in
America he had an all-time record high
of over four dollars per gallon okay
that stings but a clean conscience is
worth a buck or two
and then he said
it's important it's important I'm
willing to pay four dollars a gallon
hell I'll pay 15 a gallon because I
drive a Tesla
cool bear said
he he say he doesn't mind if you pay
more for gas because not only does he
not pay for gas he's so rich he has a
Tesla
because you know Tesla is not so cheap
um
so
I I'm not even sure that tone deaf even
covers this does it
that is a serious jerky thing to say in
public
unbelievable uh speaking of people who
uh once were worthy of respect but maybe
not So Much Anymore uh AOC okay maybe
you didn't respect her but I did
uh she's really quiet about the price of
gas lately
and the progressives are all you know
this would all be fixed if you did uh
some more impractical things such as
instantly
add lots of Green Technology that works
all day long
how about how about getting right on
that and instantly adding some
economical Green Technology that works
all day long and at night whether the
wind blows or not
so I I think AOC started out with a sort
of hyperbolic opinion that I could
support
I mean I could support it as a let's say
as a technique not as not as a political
policy but I could support her saying
you know hey we're all going to come to
Doom if we don't do something about
climate change
sure it was extreme it's but you know
that's how you get stuff done I don't
complain when when Trump says
outrageously hyperbolic things if it
works you know if it gets you in the
direction of some place you want to go
but I unfortunately the uh the current
situation with gas prices and energy
makes AOC not look like
a clever operator who's using hyperbole
in exactly the right effective way
now she looks a little bit
stupid
this is a tough place for her to be I've
got a feeling she's going to disappear
for a while
because if she if she puts her head up
about any issue
in public somebody's going to ask her
about gas prices
she basically has to hide until gas gets
under four dollars a gallon again
doesn't she
am I right
the best thing about having gas at four
dollars an hour
is it makes AOC shut the up
laughs
because that's exactly what it did you
know you were complaining about four uh
gas prices being too high until I told
you one of the benefits it makes AOC
stop saying things in public
am I right I'm right
all right uh but I don't think we can
ignore that that Rising gas prices are
insanely
expensive
um at the same time that gas prices are
up employers are telling people to come
back to work and stop working at home
what do you think of that now you think
employers should maybe say
yes if working for homework during the
pandemic maybe it should still work
you know maybe it should still work
at least for a while
somebody says bad idea
yeah well you should work really well
yeah work remotely and save money right
so you can save even more money by
working remotely
so Russia has confirmed using the
thermob thermo Barrack weapon I
literally almost said the thermo
barbaric weapon
now like that would have been pretty
clever but it wouldn't have been planned
so their Thermo barbaric weapon which
apparently is hellacious like a sexy
oxygen than the area and your your lungs
catch on fire or your filled with liquid
or some data thing but it's not a good
way to go
um as if any of them are
but
um I guess it's banned by the Geneva
Convention to be used on civilians but
apparently they do get used on Military
targets
apparently the United States can you
confirm this the United States uses
these bombs right but on Military
targets we say
the mother of all bombs is one of those
yeah so used in Afghanistan so
um
here's my question
imagine if
uh Russia had never been a major arms
dealer
one of the precedents that Putin sets by
being a major arms dealer
is that selling weapons to somebody
isn't the same as being in the fight
right that's Russia's own that that's
the standard that they set
it's their own standard because remember
they gave lots of migs and stuff to
North Korea I'm sorry not to uh North
Vietnam
so Russia has a long history of giving
pretty serious weapons
to other countries including countries
that were at least the Soviet Union
countries that were on the other side
from us
so if the standard is set
that hey I'm just selling weapons I'm
not in the fight that's Russia's own
standard
why why are we walking away from their
own standard
because before they would launch a
nuclear weapon let's say
let's say the U.S led some migs got some
migs from some NATO country and got it
into the country in Ukraine let's say
that happened
would Putin then launch an uh immediate
surprise nuclear attack
not likely like he'd talk about it first
right wouldn't he talk about it first as
in if you don't get those planes out of
there I will nuke you
I mean don't don't you think there'd be
a little bit of warning right
now
what would be the response to that the
response should be Russia can you
explain your standard
Mr in fact actually we should do this
today
we should ask Putin to Define their
standard for military sales
what standard does Russia use to decide
what kinds of weapons to sell to whom
ask them to ask them for a public
statement of their standard and then use
it
because their standard is they'll sell
anything to anybody who'll buy it right
all that I'll bet they don't use any
kind of other standard and if they tried
to say that that's they have some
standard like that it would just be
laughable but I think that you should
put them on the spot I think we should
directly ask Putin and lavrov
your lavrov's in public you just asked
questions in public ask him specifically
what is Russia's policy of what kind of
weapons to sell or provide
and does that make them a combatant
and then use that standard to put any
 weapon you want into Ukraine if
that's what you want to do I'm not sure
that's why we want to do but
at least be at least be smart about it
so I don't think that we should be
tiptoeing about what weapons we put in
there however I do think that there's
some some weight to the argument that
adding some migs to the mix wouldn't fix
anything what do you think I don't think
having those migs would have made any
difference to you
I feel like it wouldn't
compare adding migs to adding drones
right would you rather add drones or add
migs to me it's no question I take I
take the Drone every time wouldn't you
and
yeah
um and what about the uh you know the
the handheld stingers and anti-tank
stuff
how many anti-tank
an anti-aircraft handheld weapons
do you have to get into the hands of
ukrainians who I understand
I understand from ukrainians themselves
they're very I won't say warlike
but they're unusually
Brave
I'm not even sure what the word is
but apparently you don't want to mess
with ukrainians am I right it's like you
don't want to mess with anybody in
Afghanistan because it's not going to
work out for you this is not going to
work out but apparently that seems to be
somewhat true with with the ukrainians
if anything we're hearing about people
coming into Ukraine to fight is true
yeah they also came into Afghanistan I
guess
uh yeah there we'll talk about the Nazis
separately I see your comments
all right um
it's a question I have how far can a
Turkish drone fly
uh in the comments
can can a drone launched from uh Ukraine
reach Moscow
yes or no
can a drone launched from Ukraine I'm
saying almost all knows
so what then what is the no it's not a
setup for a joke
all knows really
well I'm talking about a one-way trip
in case you're wondering yes I'm talking
about a one-way trip so I'm seeing some
yeses and some no's
I'll bet the yeses are right on this
all right what's the distance uh to
Moscow from uh do you have what's the
distance from Kev to Moscow first and
then give me the distance
for the miles
469 miles
is the distance to Moscow
and then
but the range is about A Thousand Miles
all right well I don't know
um
don't know
Global Hawk drone that's a different
kind
well um it's interesting that we don't
have an instrument instant answer on
that
I I have such a well-informed audience
here usually I get an answer faster but
I I think the answer is yes
the if you're reading the comments the
way I am
it looks like more likely yes than no
but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna bet on
it and here's the question at what point
can
uh Kiev start bombing uh Moscow
no I suppose if they did
all hell would break out in Ukraine so
that would get pretty bad but
I'm wondering about it as a
communication
mechanism because apparently the Russian
public has a completely different idea
of what's going on
and I'm not suggesting it by the way let
me be clear
when I talk about military action in
Ukraine or Russia I need some witnesses
just so it doesn't look like I'm
backtracking later
I'm never recommending it
is that clear if I say if somebody did
this it looks like it would work that's
not me recommending they do it I'm just
working through what is likely to happen
What would work that sort of thing more
more about predicting where it's going
so think of me as predicting where it's
going not recommending any particular
action because if you ask me what to do
I have I have no suggestion
well I will give you a suggested a
little while but I think all suggestions
have a low chance of working at this
point
all right
um
Rasmussen
asked this question in poll would Russia
have invaded Ukraine if Trump had been
president
46 percent of U.S voters said no
38 said yes what do you
what do you think
what do you think
I think no
yeah I think no
there's there's no way to of course
there's no way to predict that but but
that's that's my instinct and I would
feel
fairly confident
fairly confident
and now
all right
um Rasmussen also asked who do you trust
more to handle U.S national security
Republicans Or democrats and by the same
almost the same percentages
46 trusted Republicans
now that's that's not too far from just
the number of Republicans plus
Independents who are really Republicans
right so basically that's people who are
Republicans or republican-ish saying
they trust themselves so I'm not sure
that's telling us much
foreign
all right here's my one suggestion on
solving Ukraine and Russia are you ready
so I'm gonna I'm gonna
talk generically about how you handle
how you fix an unfixable problem
so Russia is unfixable
because you know Putin got himself in a
position where he can't lose
but maybe he can't win
at least at least not win in a way that
he doesn't lose more than he wins
um so Putin is trapped
and zelenski doesn't have a way really
to win the war
per se
and he's not willing to lose
and apparently as long as they get
funding they'll probably
8K rations and
and shoe to people forever
so you've got an unfixable problem which
could turn Nuclear So it's got all kinds
of upside risks downside risks I guess
what do you do
here's the generic things you can do
number one you can shake the Box you
introduce a new variable or variables
that that just change everything and
then and then you see if that makes a
difference if that doesn't work you just
shake the Box again it just keeps
shaking it until there's something
different enough
that you can make a deal
the other version of shaking the box is
adding more rocks
because right now we've got uh you know
a Deadlock
but it's a deadlock that involves only
the variables for this topic largely
the more the more variables for other
topics that you can throw in there the
more likely you could get a good result
meaning that in the beginning you want
to keep a deal simple
like what's the simplest deal we could
make you stop fighting it will stop
fighting you know something really
simple
but if simple doesn't work and it's not
going to work in this situation then
your only other thing to do
is not just keep trying to do the same
thing that doesn't work
but you're gonna have to throw some new
variables in there
and you need to go big
and this is something that a trump could
do that I don't think a Biden can do
is think big enough
I think Trump had the ability to think
so big that you couldn't quite wrap your
head around it right away like build the
wall
build the wall is just too big
like you you can't Build That Wall
there's thousands of miles you know how
are you going to get a wall that will be
you know so basically Trump is the
expert saying things that are impossible
to do they're so big
and that just changes everybody's
thinking so it changed how we thought
about you know border security with or
without an actual physical wall it
changed how we thought about it it made
it a higher priority and so that that's
sort of a trump specific skill to to go
so big that it actually changes how you
think about things
right it's not just a little variable
you throw in there it just changes the
whole way you think about it
here's how I would do it with Russia I
would explicitly offer them a deal to be
our friend and not China's
in public
in public I say look here's the deal
instead of thinking this as a Ukraine
Russia problem let's think of this as
about the future of civilization problem
let's let's recognize that Ukraine is
bad as it is and it's horrible
is only a small part of a larger picture
and if we don't fix the larger picture
we'll have infinite ukrainians nobody
wants that and so the deal should be
something like this and when I say
something like it I only mean this big
number one
agreeing to some kind of deal for uh
neutrality not for Ukraine so you make
it bigger you make you you try to reach
a deal that countries
can can declare uh neutrality and the
entire world will support them
so you don't say this is about Ukraine
you say this is about all the other
countries it's about Taiwan it's about
everybody
that if if you haven't been attacked yet
and you you know you you've got a
country that just everybody will support
you you just there won't be any
exceptions to it now of course China
would have a problem with that but
that's China's problem
so what if you said to Russia here's the
deal if you stop you know hacking us and
doing every bad thing that you do to us
if you stop interfering we will add you
to the team
we will make sure that Putin looks like
the greatest leader Russia has ever had
we will make it look like the Ukraine
thing was a success but you know we'll
say that the success was
controlling those independent Russia
regions keeping Crimea which was going
to happen anyway but so basically giving
give Putin a win
but tie it to really big future stuff in
which Russia has to move into our orbit
and vice versa
and away from China
now could he could Russia do that
probably not
probably not
but it's more of an example of the size
of it
you know and maybe maybe you say look
here's the deal
we want two things that the world has to
agree or permanent
one is the major countries always have
access to let's say pipelines and uh oh
and ports
how about that say the the major Powers
always must have access permanent access
for pipelines trade
roads and ports period but the trade-off
is that a country like Ukraine who wants
to legitimately say we're going to be
demilitarizing and we're going to be
independent
they get all the support in the world
as well that's that's the trade-off
the the Nazis are still giving me a
problem to deal with yeah
I don't know if that's anybody's biggest
problem there though
uh Logistics who enforces it
you know there are lots of things to
work out but the point is is there
something that that Putin could get at
this that's bigger than anything he
hoped for and I don't know but I'll bet
we could promise him something
I'll bet we could promise Putin
something's bigger a bigger win than he
than he had even imagined he could get
but it would have to be in return for a
permanent
friendship deal just a permanent
friendship deal
if there's any way to do it now I
suppose there is a a cultural
element here that I don't appreciate
which is can Russians ever stop trying
to overpower their neighbors
and I think that's a real question is
there something baked into the culture
this as if I can conquer this little
country next to me why wouldn't I
is that just part of the culture I don't
know if it is maybe there's nothing you
can do
the can Americans yeah
I I don't think the American personality
is such that we need to conquer anything
at this point
at this point
all right well that's the big question
um
apparently China is backing Russia as
propaganda domestically so that the
Chinese audience is hearing Russia's
version of things great so that does a
further indication that China and Russia
are in bed together
yeah are you following the story about
the bio labs in Ukraine
so we got some ambiguous information
about there might be some kind of a U.S
Associated bio labs in the Ukraine well
the Department of State of State said
this
uh in a statement the United States does
not have chemical and biological weapons
labs in Ukraine
let's parse that sentence a little bit
I'll read it again the United States
does not have chemical and biological
weapons labs in Ukraine
well there are a few things that this
does not cover
it does not cover
a chemical lab that's separate from the
biological lab
is there such a thing as a chemical and
biological weapons lab because the thing
they said they don't have has an and in
it we don't have a chemical and
biological weapons
but do you have a chemical lab and do
you separately have a weapons lab
or do you just call them different
things
do you have a different name for them
do you call them research facilities and
not labs
it says the United States does not have
them in Ukraine does that mean the
United States hasn't funded somebody who
has one
it doesn't say anything about funding
one
um it doesn't say we had one until last
week did we have any until last week did
we just close them yesterday because
it's a little bit silent on whether we
ever had them
um
so I would say that the specificity with
which they have denied this is very
sketchy
very sketchy
wouldn't you say
now I don't think this is a big a real
story or a big story
I I think this is mostly a fake story I
don't think there's necessarily anything
here that
we have to worry about
but maybe who knows I mean how do we
know
so my guess is that the whole bio lab
story is uh there's probably something
at the base of it
but maybe not something we necessarily
have to worry about too much
and I'm going to say that the Wisconsin
uh
election claims you've heard claims
seems to only appear in right leaving
media
that uh the the
that there have been found
irregularities in the 2020 Wisconsin
election however when I put that out to
my Skeptics it doesn't appear that
that's going to hold up
so if I had to bet I would bet the
Wisconsin claims of fraud will not hold
up
sorry
and the reason I say that is because the
news never jumped to any other of the
major media
it didn't even really make it to the
say the high-end right-leaning media and
it never got into the
uh out of the swamp of the rightest of
the right leaning stuff now does that
mean it's wrong
let me be clear
let me be clear
I don't see how 50 states could all run
legitimate elections
to me it seems ridiculous
to imagine that when we see how well
everything else in the world works
have we not watched
everything else in the world fail from
our experts in everything right
literally our experts and everything
have you know failed
but sure are election experts in 50
different states with high stakes and
High Gain for cheating and really no
comprehensive audits in most cases that
that all that worked out
that the only thing that works the way
we want it to is elections
and there are 50 of them
50 separate entities running elections
and yet it's the only situation in the
entire world and the history of humanity
that it all worked out and it was fair
and everybody did their job and nobody
cheated in a major way
that's what we're being asked to believe
in the context of seeing literally every
organization being corrupt
and terrible
except for our voting systems in all 50
states why even our smallest little
States those Scrappy accomplishers
even they got it right
we're told
so I don't have uh I don't have reason
to believe that the Wisconsin claims are
going to pan out because remember what I
said who remembers my prediction at the
very beginning
of the claims of election fraud
I said
that whether or not there is fraud
I can guarantee that 95 percent of the
claims of fraud will not be real
do you remember that say if you remember
that one of my best predictions
that no matter that we may never know if
there's any real fraud because 95 of
everything that's offered as fraud will
be debunked and that will make it all
look like fraud so it wouldn't we would
never know if there was any real stuff
in there
because 95 percent of it is going to be
unreal and it'll just disguise any real
stuff that might have been there and by
the way let me say clearly so I don't
get demonetized
I'm not aware of any proven uh fraud in
the 2020 election
not aware of it
all right doesn't either
uh apparently lavrov is saying that
hospital that was bombed was really uh
actually taken over by militants and it
was the Ukrainian soldiers who were in
there not any patients and that it's all
fake news and then the World Health
Organization says there have been 24
verified attacks on health care
facilities in Ukraine so far
do you think that that means that Russia
has a policy of attacking hospitals
go do you believe that Russia
has an Express policy of attacking
hospitals
do you believe it or not
I say all knows thank you
well that's that's that's so
well I'm very oppressed I am so
impressed with all of you
because
we don't know what's going on there but
the most popular lie during the war is
that the other side bombed your hospital
am I right it's the number one most
popular
guaranteed to happen
lie
suppose suppose Russia had never bombed
any hospitals
do you think there would be a story with
details and pictures about Russia
bombing a hospital if they had never
bombed anything
of course or what of course it would
because it's every time
you don't even have to wonder about it
you you could have set your timer from
from the first bomb that went off in the
Ukraine you could have been set the
timer and say all right uh seven days
until the first story about a hospital
being bombed
now
here's my question
is there any military who has ever
intentionally bombed a hospital
because there was a let's say an overall
strategy that it
demoralizes the public
somebody says yes to the Nazis but ask
yourself if that was propaganda against
the Nazis because I'm not even sure the
Nazis bombed hospitals
the Japanese in China
see here's the problem when I ask you
for historical examples
I'll bet all of the historical examples
that you believe are historically true
I'll bet they're all not true
I'll bet it's never been true
because can you can anybody explain the
strategy
I I don't I don't think I don't think it
makes sense as a strategy
well Nagasaki of course that was
you know that was a civilian attack of
course
yeah so certainly uh yeah I mean hirosha
not Nagasaki are special cases Dresden
yeah I mean we certainly see examples of
civilians being targeted so I'm not I'm
not questioning whether military is
Target a civilian population centers
that's a given
but specifically hospitals you know
before you've leveled the whole town
you're going to go off to the hospital
first
I don't know I call me skeptical
it feels like exactly the opposite of
what a good strategy would be but
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
is almost everything I wanted to tell
you except that
um here's something uh for YouTube the
people on locals have known this for
some time
um
I'm going to say this publicly just
because I'm a public figure but
otherwise I'm not going to be talking
about it
um I am separated slash going through a
divorce
only reason I'm telling you that is if
you see my ex-wife on a date or me
don't worry about it because it's it's a
process that's been going on for some
time
so if you see either of us out in public
you don't have to alert the media
we we've moved on
so
it was a it was a tough pandemic for
some of us
I don't think you have to worry about
I'm not looking for any sympathy please
please no sympathy
none is deserved
um things are good until they're not
good
if you're wondering what happened I
don't know
I don't know have you ever gone through
a breakup and when you're done you
weren't really sure why
because there were so many reasons there
were no reasons and then there were 100
reasons and then if you go from no
reasons at all to 100 reasons
it means you don't really know what the
reason was
so I don't know peace me
uh but
but just just be kind
just know I'm not going to give you any
more information on it yeah life happens
so you know I did spend
I Spent A Little More Time On prisoner
Island this year than than I was
planning to uh but prisoner Island only
goes one way
and if you don't recognize that
analogy
it comes from what I call my operating
system
my operating system is my my uh my
central idea of who I am
the always stays the same no matter
what's happening to me
and and I use prisoner Island as my um
story
that runs in my head all the time it
goes like this
that uh there's an island of just
prisoners and I'm dropped on the island
because I've been probably unjustly
accused of something
um
yeah of course there's a prenup
and uh and I again dropped on prisoner
Island the first day the prisoners beat
me up because there's no law there and
they they beat me up and leave me for
dead second day they beat me up and
steal my clothes and leave me for dead
third day they beat me up and raped me
and leave me for that three days in a
row but if you come back in a year
all the people who touched me will be
dead and I'll be in charge of prisoner
Island
so that's that's that's the story that
runs into my head so whenever I find
myself in a situation
shall we say
that's not so positive I tell myself
okay I'm on prisoner Island
first three days not going to be good
check back in a year
because in a year I am going to crawl
through whatever this is I'm going to
eat a mile of if I have to
I'm going to do whatever it takes
but in a year I'm going to be in charge
of prisoner Island and everybody who
touched me is going to be dead
so
I just take that attitude to anything
I'm doing and
I find it helps a lot
all right
um
[Music]
hahaha
all right but be kind okay so I would
ask you to be kind to her
she doesn't she doesn't need or deserve
any any bad vibes uh and
just recognize that you know life has
some ups and downs all right that's all
for now and I'll talk to you
tomorrow
