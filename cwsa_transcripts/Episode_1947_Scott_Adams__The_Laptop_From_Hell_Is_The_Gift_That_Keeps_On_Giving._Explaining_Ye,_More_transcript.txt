good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
that at least half of the country knows
about
the other half well they seem to be in
their own little world
and we have no connection to them
but if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that can only be
accomplished with illegal drugs
but without the illegal drugs all you
need is a copper mugger a glass of
tanker cell system canteen jogger
philaska vessel of any kind filler with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the other day
the the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous set
but happens now go
um
Scott would you be so kind to start the
YouTube stream about 30 seconds early
mean as in
before the start time
I I don't know about that is that
because you missed a simultaneous it
because the recorded version has it all
is it when you live stream you miss the
first 30 seconds
is that what happens
I'll look into that maybe there's
something I can do
yeah how can I start before I start
exactly perfectly good question
oh excuse the ads oh it's the ads right
so if you if you don't have the the
YouTube Red you have to look at it at uh
okay I got it
got it okay we'll see what we can do
well here's some good news potentially
I always like to follow Machiavelli's
underbelly good Twitter account
um yeah it was a fun interesting
positive things happening in the
technology so there's some scientists at
the University of Birmingham in the UK
and they figured out how to use laser
light treatment
to improve your memory by up to 25
percent
your short-term memory anyway they don't
know if it lasts but they think they
could also use this light treatment
for ADHD
now apparently it's non-invasive
so I don't know exactly where do they
Shine the Light
it's a laser and it's non-invasive
but what exactly is a non-invasive laser
but do you shoot a laser in somebody's
eyes I guess so probably but as you know
if Trump
supported this it would be reported as
Trump favors
injecting bleach into people's eyes
to improve their ADHD
that would that would be the story
well you know it would you know it would
so maybe that'll be cool maybe they can
treat ADHD now let me tell you my
experience with light
as a professional writer I put great
care
into the physical environment in which I
try to write a huge difference I like to
have both of my feet on the ground
not crossed if I cross my legs or put my
feet up right to sleep I also have to
have a you have the right kind of
distraction and and physical environment
but the light
I've discovered is one of the biggest
factors
if you get the light right you can write
for a long time
if you get the light wrong that puts you
in a whole different
physical mode so I do think that it
could be that we will unlock all kinds
of benefits with light treatments
or bleach uh there's also a potential
obesity treatment in which they can give
you some kind of a compound
that will change the nature of the fat
in your body
so that it still does whatever fat needs
to do in your body that's good for you
but it doesn't get bigger
what do you think of that
I feel like there could be a
an accidental
impact of that
do you know how much I would eat if I if
I didn't get fat
the only thing that keeps me from eating
all day long is that I don't want to be
overweight if I could eat and not get
fat
oh my God
I'd just be eating and pooping all day
long I'd be as happy as hell
well it doesn't take much to keep me
happy I guess
how many of you saw the prankster
who talked at the Austin city council
meeting and he did what I call Embrace
and amplify
oh thank you John sunlight is good
uh so this prankster pretends to be a
real person
and he's wearing a like a communist
communism shirt Pro communism
and he gets up and he does a whole thing
about
how Elon must take you over Twitter is
the worst thing
but I wasn't sure it was a prank
until some other people confirmed it
because the reality and parody are so
similar so here's the first thing that
the pranksters had that made me say
huh
that does sound ridiculous
but not more ridiculous than what actual
real people say
so see if you think this is way too
ridiculous or something that an average
person if you stopped him on the street
might actually say like an actual thing
a person would say
he said that Elon Musk taking over
Twitter is worse than the Holocaust and
it might even be worse than January 6th
now is that perfect
that's some good writing first of all
that's really good writing for a prank
Elon taking over Twitter is worse than
the Holocaust and it might even be worse
than January 6th implying the January
6th was worse than the Holocaust
and the thing is I I think he finished
his entire thing without people catching
God that it was a prank
now
would you like to end wokeness forever
how about doing more of this
suppose every single public hearing had
one of these
but you kept getting closer and closer
to reality so they really actually
couldn't tell if you were kidding like
they just couldn't tell what would
happen
what would happen if you took all of the
arguments on the right and you started
making them even stronger than they are
but what would happen if every time uh
every time some medicine came out the
Democrats thought was a good idea you
accused them of drinking bleach I
recommending it just just do everything
they do and act like you're serious
about it it would just make everything
ridiculous the entire world would just
become absurd overnight
but it would be funny
uh here's something we learned so there
was there's a project called open AI
That was supposed to be I guess uh
non-profit and the the idea was they had
developed Ai and I don't know it'd be
good for the world I guess there's some
profit element to it now but
uh we learned from Elon Musk that open
AI had access to Twitter data to train
it
had access to Twitter data now I think
that means more than just reading what
you and I read I think that means the
API
meaning that you could get directly into
the data stream of Twitter with
permission you know that would be an
entirely legitimate thing to do but are
you comfortable with AI
knowing everything about your Twitter
experience
if AI learned about me only from Twitter
could it reproduce my personality
if it only knew my Twitter experience
it could reproduce it but it would be
the and the attenuated version
Twitter me is not me you know that right
my Twitter personality is not like my
base personality in the same way if I
talk to a child
that's not my base personality that's
how I modified to talk to a child if I
give a
if I give a talk in front of a big crowd
in public
that's not my actual personality
that's my modified personality for an
audience
this isn't my real personality this is
my modified personality for the purpose
of doing the live stream right they're
all versions of me so they're not
dishonest because they're the real
version of me modified to the the
purpose but there's no you know there's
no version it's me but what if AI said
well I'm gonna I've got like 10 000
tweets and likes and stuff from this guy
a reproduce them based on what I know
from Twitter
be a little dangerous wouldn't it
because it wouldn't necessarily know
that's not me
that is my performance version of me
yeah
speaking of the performance version of
people
that's a theme we might get to a little
bit
but uh
you know you wonder if a musk actually
blocked open AI temporarily anyway
blocked AI
from using Twitter data which seems like
the right move until you know a little
bit more about the ramifications of that
I like that and I also like the
transparency
because musk told us what it was and
what it is and
flagged it as a potential problem
without any specifics and if you don't
know what the specific problem is then
pausing to find out is
exactly the right thing to do
so
good on him I saw I saw somebody on the
left criticize
musk for trying things and then
reversing them
and I think you mentioned three or four
things that he tried at Twitter and then
quickly reversed as if that's him doing
a bad job
how much how much more wrong could you
be about something in public
to imagine that rapidly trying things in
software because it's a software-based
company rapidly trying things seeing how
they do how they're accepted rapidly
adjusting right in front of you and
there's somebody who says that's failing
like oh that's a bad job you tried these
things and then you reversed them
now if a hundred percent of everything
you tried got reversed well then you'd
have some kind of a point
but if nine out of 10 things he tries
gets reversed you do not have a point
because that's the game is to get one
out of ten that works and keep it and
not you try you know ten things to get
one that works that'd be about what I
would expect you know one out of ten
would be a good pretty good actually if
you got one out of ten
um
so
The Washington Post
is accusing MSNBC of racism for firing
one of their black journalists
is there anything else to say about that
story
and like I could put more words around
it but I feel like that's like the seed
of a story I can just give you the seed
and then it goes to your head and it
blossoms into the whole story
like I don't I don't need to add
anything do I
the the left is accusing the left of
being racist
I don't know it's kind of perfect
but you also knew that that's where I
had to go right
one once your model of the world is that
as groups against groups all you see is
groups
and everything is one group against
another so the left has to eat itself in
the long run
that the the inevitable evolution of the
left is asked to eat itself has to break
into atomized parts and start fighting
the right does not necessarily have that
fate why
why does the right
have more protection against devolving
into a bunch of partisans
it's the Constitution
because people because what whatever you
believe as long as you're pretty serious
about the Constitution yeah you're on my
side
I'm not a conservative
but if you're if you're real serious
about the Constitution you're on my side
that's the beginning of the end of my uh
analysis of your value
if you're not on the side of the
Constitution well you're you're a risk
to me that's a risk you I'm not saying
you're a bad person but it's a risk to
me but if you're on the same side as the
Constitution you and I can live together
and I can disagree with you about all
kinds of stuff
won't make any difference to me in fact
I might even enjoy the disagreement
might add to my you know the the flavor
of my life
but yeah you're you're fine with me as
long as we agree on the Constitution
let's see I wonder if there are any uh
people associated with the right
who don't like the Constitution because
that would be weird
in fact if you were if you were a
political figure on the right
and you were anti-constitution
that would be pretty much the end of you
wouldn't it
well next story uh Trump is uh in favor
of ignoring the Constitution
so he uh he posted on true social
um he said quote do you throw the
presidential election results of 2020
out and declare the rightful winner
which would be him of course in his view
or do you have a new election a massive
fraud of this type and magnitude allows
for the termination of all rules
regulations and articles even those
found in the Constitution
Trump wrote
and we're done
and we're done
and we're done
now here's the only way that this could
be okay
the only way I could understand this as
being okay
is if Trump is simply trying to bring
some attention to himself by saying the
most outrageous thing you could say and
getting everybody talking about it
but unfortunately the left or
fortunately maybe the left has decided
that he will get no attention
and so is Fox News and I think
breitbart's sort of on that page now
so uh Trump's ability to say outrageous
things and get attention is really
diminished
really diminished so if it successfully
got him all kinds of attention
you could actually argue maybe it's
working in his favor in a weird kind of
way because he's done that before that
would be a standard play but does it
look like that
here's what I wonder
I'm I'm watching uh Elon Musk and also
yay
attract all the energy
and I think Trump is left the sort of
energy energy poor there's not enough
energy going in his Direction and so
he's got a top Elon Musk
the laptop story
and whatever the hell yeah is doing
today
to get to get to Greater level of
outrageousness than our Baseline because
the Baseline is so outrageous now
that getting above that takes a little
work
Barry I'm going to get rid of you just
for being an
there's no other reason you're just an
goodbye
um
poor Barry
Barry we will miss you
no we won't we won't miss you Barry
so in my opinion uh Trump has very
little uh
little room to operate because to get
more outrageous than what is the
Baseline there's just no room left you
have to you have to go all the way to
maybe we should throw out the
Constitution
now you can't defend Trump after he says
maybe you throw out the Constitution
because that was the setup right the
setup was hey January 6 is about Trump
wanting to overthrow the country and be
a dictator
to which all of us said no that's not
what that was that that's totally not
what that was that was the opposite that
literally the opposite the protesters
wanted to make sure the system
worked the way it was designed
and they weren't sure that that was
happening so they asked for a delay to
make sure that the constitution is
working the way it was designed
that's all
but the the left created this trap that
said you know it really was trying to
overthrow the Constitution and the
country
and then Trump walks right into the Trap
by saying after all of this
after all the energy I wasted
explaining that January 6 wasn't what
you thought it was it's a it's an OP by
the left and it is but all that all that
wasted time defending that you know the
the at least the Trump supporters were
on the right side and he just threw them
under the bus
because all of those January 6
supporters are going to be tarred by
this opinion
because people the left is going to say
well Trump just said directly let's get
rid of the Constitution
right he said it directly if it helps
him ignore the Constitution and now
they're going to Tar all those
you know well-meaning Patriots who
really were just trying to make it a
better country and all of them are going
to be tarred by this they should drop
him like the hottest Rock of all time
I I don't see any way he comes back from
this he's just so done right that's my I
had one red line
would you agree well I mean I wouldn't
support somebody who was actually
literally racist I wouldn't do that
that's a red line
but the other red line is you have to be
on the side of the Constitution
is that asking a lot to be on the side
of the Constitution yeah fentanyl is a
single issue vote
but
you know I would still allow that
somebody's in the contest
but really
I don't know uh so I think Trump
um is as done as you could possibly be
which is interesting because who's left
now what happens what happens if Trump
is not viable
but nobody primaries him
because nobody else is viable because
Trump will take him out
it's gonna get real interesting
Scott you did not read the entire quote
I don't need to I don't need to read the
entire quote if you're saying that the
entire quote would soften it or change
its meaning that's irrelevant because
the way it will be presented is the way
I just presented it
so if you think that I'm ignoring the
truth
the truth isn't part of the topic the
the topic I'm talking about is what will
people think and feel about it the truth
is somewhat irrelevant you know what was
he really thinking or what did he
technically say
not relevant just not relevant because
he walked into a trap and then he sprung
about himself what am I supposed to
ignore that
Junior Coltrane Scott is a real Sam
Harris
in all caps
I can't even tell if you're real
or a troll
all right
um Biden has a new tweet with a photo of
him in the Oval Office working
and uh I noticed he's got a comic strip
that's framed on the table behind them
now as you know I was not a supporter of
President Biden
but I was willing to based on which
comic that was it was a little blurry
but some people did some research and
they determined that the comic was Hagar
the Horrible
Hagar the Horrible
I I was willing to let it go when I
found out that Biden was a huge liar all
of his career
said a lot of things about himself that
weren't true
I was annoyed
when he pushed the fine people hoax and
and he was running for office to end The
Lying by being a huge liar I was
concerned about his
dealings with or or Hunters dealings
with foreign countries and I didn't like
what he did with his inflation and
some of his work policies but I was
willing to
I was willing to
maybe Overlook some of those things for
the unity of the country
but
he has a Hagar the Horrible comic behind
his desk
I I can't I can't ignore that
I can't ignore that yeah no he didn't go
full pickles if he had gone full pickles
which is another comic uh that that
would be too far but Hagar Hagar
I don't know if I can forgive that
let's talk about Twitter because
that's what we do every day
so uh Elon Musk has confirmed something
I was speculating about you said The
more Twitter improves its signal to
noise ratio the less relevant
conventional news becomes
and they followed up with another tweet
he said the intelligence of this hive
mind meaning Twitter will improve
significantly as signal to noise
effective cross-linking of tweets and
speed of tweets all improve
so
um
remember I said
that the thing you have to be cautious
about when you're trying to predict
whether Elon Musk will be successful
with Twitter
is it the thing you have to understand
is he's not trying to make it as
successful as Twitter 1.0 he's not
tweaking Twitter 1.0
he's probably going to create something
that does payments replaces old news you
know becomes the way you communicate
instead of texting
is probably replaces Tick Tock who knows
what else will replace
yeah he's thinking big and so he is
literally thinking of replacing uh the
news but you can't replace the news
if Twitter is nothing but partisans
battling
so if the only thing that if the only
change that musk makes
is to make sure that all uh
controversial claims are connected to
some context that the other side would
like you to see
he has beaten the TV and other news
business completely
because they can't match that
the the other news entities don't really
even try to add context
if he did and it looks like Twitter's
the perfect tool to add context if he
does
there is no reason to read the news
anymore so here's a little uh
here's a little confirmation for the
musk opinion
my normal routine for the last several
years is I get up and I look at CNN
and I look at Fox News and follow some
other stories in other places and then
I'll also check all the tweets to see
what the tweeters are saying about the
news and then I have a good picture to
make my comments for the day
since since musk took over
about half of the days that I come on
here I have not checked to CNN or Fox
News
because Twitter has the news
and then has all the reactions to the
news and a little bit more more and more
is going to have the context that was
not in the news
why would I check the news
when I can get the news plus the context
plus the comments
the news is already obsolete I mean the
regular news
uh here's a ten dollar question which
government intelligence agencies you
think Epstein worked for
um well I don't think it was necessarily
our government
do you assume Epstein worked for our
government exclusively
I would imagine he had some connections
to a variety of high-level people and
more than one country all right so I I
don't assume it's some American only
situation
all right uh here's the most important
thing you need to know about uh Elon
Musk buying Twitter
you know the movie The The Matrix and
the the star of The Matrix the character
was Neo
Neo Neo
so when Neo enters the Matrix
uh what you should know is that was
completely different
that Elon entering Twitter
because when Neo entered the Matrix
Neo has only 75 percent of the letters
that are also in the word Elon
so that's a pretty big difference it's
like a 25 difference in their names
everything else is roughly the same as
Neo entering the Matrix because both
Twitter and the Matrix have the same
purpose
the purpose of Twitter is great and
artificial reality such that you don't
know what your the real reality is
you're living in
that's literally The Matrix movie
The Matrix movie is that you believe
you're in one reality but the Matrix
holds you in another that's literally
what what Twitter is doing
literally they're doing that
now usually I make fun of people
comparing things to a movie but this is
not comparing to
this is same as right I mean not
actually uh
connected by tubes and living in a in a
vat
but we might be
we might be for all we know
here's the other funny Twitter related
thing I you know
musk has got to be the best Tweeter
since Trump and maybe he's in Better
but look at how he handled this
situation with a tweet
and the Tweet comes from Elon musk's
ex-wife Justine Musk
and Justine musk on December 2nd tweeted
so
I would like to note that she began her
tweet with the word so
I wonder what the rest of the Tweet will
be
will it be insightful analysis
hmm
what comes after the word so
uh good facts and logic
oh no let's read on let's read on and
find out if we can guess what comes
after the word so does anybody want to
take a guess if you I'd like to attest
your intelligence here
ah do you know what comes after the word
so
oh yes ridiculous straw man
a a version of reality that nobody holds
so that you can insult it I wonder if
that will will come after the word so
well let me read on and find out
so let me get this straight
I'm going to give you another quiz
what follows the phrase let me get this
straight go
what follows let me get this straight
would it be getting it straight
or would it be intentionally distorting
into something that is definitely the
opposite of getting it straight which
one do you predict because you're smart
look at you go
look at you go
well you know just when I think there's
a limit to your intelligence you surpass
it again I am amazed I don't even need
to give you the news anymore do I
I could just come here and you tell me
the news without even knowing what it is
that's how good you are
all right let me try it again you think
I can't do this
uh you fill in the blank
the Pope
had a comment about Ukraine what is it
go
what what will the pope say about
Ukraine that this hasn't happened lately
he is against violence
he's in favor of peace
a year like Geniuses you are freaking
geniuses
wow
you know the news before it happens
all right let me ask you another uh
there's a gigantic Blockbuster story in
which everything the left has been doing
for years has been uncovered and now
their shame and embarrassment will eat
them alive as all of their supporters
and followers find out about this
Blockbuster laptop from Hell being
suppressed story on Twitter
okay
what what happens next
what happens next
how did you know
how did you guess this
how did you guess that this story would
be so completely suppressed that it
would be as if it never happened
how did you know that the only people
that would hear the Blockbuster story
are the people who already knew
it was true
and not a single other person will hear
it unless it's paired with some
explanation of why it's not really what
you think it is
well you guessed pretty good because it
turns out the New York Times ignored it
Washington Post ignored it CNN ignored
it I think MSNBC ignored it the entire
left closed ranks
and disappeared the story
exactly like you thought they
would
now
what happens to my YouTube feed
here I am on YouTube this big Channel
do you think YouTube is letting this go
out to all the people who need to hear
it
I would be highly doubtful that my
YouTube feed
is completely non-suppressed and that
like it's it's being treated like every
other feed
Maybe
I mean anything's possible but
everything we know about everything
suggests that this is being suppressed
right now would you agree
how many of you would say yeah you're
definitely being suppressed there's no
question about it
yeah your geniuses every one of you are
geniuses that's true
yeah
all right so
here's what uh Justine continues to say
he she said so let me get this straight
we are now supposed to step into the
quote Marketplace of ideas to to debate
plus discuss if Hitler behaved poorly
or if women should be quote raped and
locked in cages
because these are conversations the
culture needs to be having
so what would Justine musk's ex-husband
Elon Musk how would he reply to a
a a tweet like that
well the way he did reply was with one
emoji
and I'll try to do the emoji face so you
can see it
if if you're if you're listening to this
and not watching I just did a clever and
humorous impression of an emoji with a
wrinkled up uh mouth expression as in
what the
yeah if there were a caption to that
emoji it would be
what the
it was perfect
it was perfect
any any word he had added to that emoji
would have decreased you know the impact
or the or the Perfection of it it was
just perfect yeah I think it was
smirking face it's just like well what
do you say to that
there's literally no comment about it
that could have helped
it was just it just has to sit there on
its own
just it is what it is
but with one emoji
uh Elon Musk described his entire
marriage experience
in ways which every man completely
understood
uh message received got it expanding now
in my mind from one emoji to whoa whoa
this is a good story wow now continue to
expand to explain the entire marital
dynamic
ending in divorce got it got it so
that's nobody's ever said more with one
emoji
you could piece together their entire
history
and and can you imagine their arguments
in person
come on just just hold it in your head
just imagine that he had to hear that
every day
how many days in a row do you have to
listen to that before you before you say
I think marriage isn't for me I'm just
going to knock up a bunch of women and
have kids I don't think this marriage
thing
you know by Design I don't think it's a
good system it's not well engineered
imagine being the most storied engineer
in American history although he's
technically even not an engineer he just
happens to be the best one uh that would
be the storied engineer and
that's the system that you have to put
yourself into
do you think you do you think Elon Musk
looks at the institution and system of
marriage and says to himself now that's
a good system
if I were going to engineer a system for
society it would look just like that
no I don't think so
um
it's just a is your mind blown away by
the fact that the New York Times didn't
cover the Twitter expose
like what does that do to your head
I mean it does tell you everything you
suspected was true not just about this
right I mean such a strong signal that
literally everything you suspected was
true about everything just about
everything it was all true
in some in some form
um
[Music]
so every time the conservatives have
this uh I got you this time feeling
what always happens
we've been through this before right ah
we got you this time now that the truth
has come out
watch what happens when the people on
the left learn the truth
it never happens does it
there's just it just bounces off
and I was I was looking at you know how
will the Democrats
try to put a little uh illusion wall
around this to protect themselves
and I saw this uh tweet by
was it David Corn
um oh yeah
so he tweeted at Elon before the expose
came out he said uh in preparation
please read my original piece on the
hunter Biden laptop now according to
Corn the big issue all right so ignore
all the smaller issues
because that that's not really what's
good here's the big issue because you
don't want to you don't want to be left
on this little issue about maybe
Democrats or getting people kicked off
of Twitter and using it to affect the
light that's the small stuff so don't
get lost in the weeds
because here's the big story I don't
know if you noticed
but the hunter laptop the big story as
corn tells us the big issue was that the
New York Post and Giuliani used the
existence of the laptop and iffy
materials on it to advance Russian
disinformation concocted to hurt Biden
and help Trump
as of a few days ago
a prominent Democrat
was pushing that
the laptop was not Russian
disinformation
but
supportive of
oh my God
present time
pressle time no no it wasn't Russian
disinformation did anybody tell you that
no it was information that supported the
disinformation of the the Russians and
that disinformation I will not specify
because there are no real examples to
prove my point but I'd like to throw
Russian disinformation into it to
confuse it so that my dom Democrats who
read this will think well maybe that
Republican story was wrong because
there's something about still Russian
disinformation in it and by the way it
wasn't manafort proof that the Russian
collusion happened
it's the manafort play
it's the manafort play
oh did you say that uh Trump was cleared
of Russian collusion hahaha
obviously the opposite happened because
manafort who is not Trump uh was guilty
of a Russia related crime
that wasn't specifically related to the
main accusations
so good try on that
and then uh have you seen the latest
narrative so all the left pundits got
the memo and it's always funny when the
people who realize that they're all
using the same talking points when they
do the little compilation so you can see
that they're all little you know talking
has to say the same thing so the new
talking point is that people who are
tweeting about the Twitter Revelations
are doing quote PR for one of the
richest men in the world
so apparently they did some research
and they decided that since Democrats
don't like rich people
that you could just uh you could just
dismiss musk for being a rich person
and that why should anybody be doing PR
for a rich person and that's that's what
they have and they're a whole bunch of
tweets they have the exact wording PR
for one of the richest men in the world
they don't just they don't say it a
different way they actually use the
exact
sentence lots and lots of people
so I wonder
I wonder you know when that gets put out
you know where did they all get that
they all get it from the same Source
right are they copying each other or do
they actually do they literally have a
talking points
memo they do don't they
isn't there literally a talking point
memo of some sort that they know where
to look for I think so
all right
um
so Michael uh Tracy tweets about uh so
uh
Noel is it Noel the author the old
author whatever he was so the guy who
was in charge of uh Twitter's executive
who was in charge of I guess Banning
people and other things
um he had a public event and he said
that the decision to ban Trump after
January 6 was impelled in part by the
trauma that he and other content
monitors batteries were experiencing
so there's some there's some confession
Joel Roth thank you
there's some confession that it wasn't
purely a free speech or even a financial
decision
it was how they felt
it was literally how they felt now it
wasn't the only factor I think you know
Michael Tracy might be you know giving
it a little more attention than it
deserves it wasn't the only Factor but
but the fact that how they felt was any
part of the decision
is
repeat it after me
exactly what you thought it was
it's exactly what you suspected
have we all just turned into Geniuses or
or are people just doing exactly what
you expect all the time now like nobody
does anything except exactly what you
expected
it's like that that's all there is
has anybody done anything unexpected in
a while
well yes there is somebody doing
something unexpected
do you think I'll be talking about that
person
oh maybe
Maybe
you know I think the problem with the
Twitter content people is that they
believe their own propaganda
don't you don't you think the biggest
problem that the left has with mental
health
is that they literally believe
themselves
and I don't even know how many people
who say things on the left you know the
notable people who are creating the
narrative
I have no idea how much they believe out
of their own narrative
but I know the people who consume their
narrative buy into it
and you'd have to think it would give
you mental health problems wouldn't you
because think about the narrative that
the left is given
and then the all the counter factuals or
the you know the The observed
things that debunk their their View and
somehow they can incorporate all the
counter factuals and still go along it's
like serious you know implied or is sort
of a an imposed mental illness
it's like a mental illness that's
imposed on them from the outside by the
narratives
I wonder if you could have narrative
poisoning
yeah I think I'm going to invent a term
narrative poisoning
if the narrative which is not true
causes you to have a physical reaction
which is true
then you have narrative poisoning
right
narrative poisoning is it which is
different from just believing something
that's not true
believing something that's not true is
sort of you know daily life we're all
believing stuff that's not true
but if you buy into a narrative and it
makes you sick you have narrative
poisoning
you don't have you don't you're not sick
because of reality
because that's not what a narrative is
narrative poisoning so I think that the
Twitter Executives actually had
narrative poisoning and they were they
were acting out partly on mental health
issues
let me let me now uh
excuse the behavior of all the Twitter
professionals
they were they were operating on a PTSD
which they gave themselves
it was self-induced PTSD
they had narrative poisoning TDS and
they acted on their Mental Health
they acted to reduce their mental health
problems and they used Twitter
like it was a pharmaceutical drug
that if they tweaked it just right they
could reduce their mental health issues
and so they did
so they did
how much do you love that
they use Twitter like a Pharma
Pharmaceutical
to improve their Mental Health
that actually happened
right there's nothing about that
sentence
that is hyperbole that actually
literally
observably happened
they they've admitted they had you know
mental distress
they told you what they did about it
and and in an out in an analogy sense
they use Twitter to cure their mental
distress
like you would use a pharmaceutical
and it had it had side effects
and the side effects were unexpected
all right
Dr Scott Barry Kaufman who's also a
interesting fellow on Twitter I
recommend them
um
he said today this this was
I'm going to disagree with him a little
bit here but this was a good
contribution to the conversation he said
people are blaming yay's behavior on his
bipolar diagnosis I'd like to point out
that when you see histrionic and
antagonist
antagonistic anti-social behaviors they
are much better predicted by
narcissistic personality disorder than
bipolar disorder see here for the
correlation Matrix and no pun intended
he shows a matrix
of course acid Matrix of uh
um different I know
different behaviors and what it means
you know and they correlate Etc
and if you see a chart a matrix of
mental
let's say mental illness
into in 2022 what do you what do you
think about it
it just all looks like astrology
when I see a complicated medical
scientific chart my immediate point is
that it's not an immediate impression is
well that's not true it's just
and it doesn't even matter what the
topic is
like it could have been you know any any
part of mental or physical health if
I've seen that that complicated chart
I would have just assumed it wasn't true
so that's where we are now we're at the
point where anything medical medical
experts say
and they put a big scientific chart with
data I just say well that's probably not
true I'm not going to ignore it
because you know when experts say
something you don't want to ignore it it
might be true but the credibility is you
know below zero
now do you think that the mental health
Community the the experts do you think
they can tell the difference between
these various diagnoses
do you think that they if you had 10
mental health professionals and they all
diagnosed EA do you think they'd all
agree
no they would not they would not agree
do you know why
because it's not a science
it's not even close it's complete
 it's a it's a Pharma industry
created thing that's sort of trying to
look like science but mostly is
and scams and liars and
bad ideas yeah
so now just to be clear
I'm sure there are some valuable
elements of the mental health profession
I'm sure of it
but do you think I could figure out
which ones are the real ones and which
ones are the complete of course
not because I have no ability to do that
do you know who else can't do that
the people in the industry
because if they could tell what was
 in their own industry
they'd all have the same opinion
but they can't that's why they have
different opinions and if the experts in
their own industry can't tell what's
real and what isn't why should you
believe them
let's say you go to a financial expert
Financial expert says here that here's
how you should invest you say thank you
good information I'm going to get a
second opinion though so you go to a
second Financial expert and they say do
something different
you go hmm two different opinions okay I
better check with another one let's say
you check with a bunch of financial
people and you get
you get advice that's on both directions
some say sell your stock some say hold
your stock some say get out of stocks
and do something different what would
your conclusion be would your conclusion
be that experts know more than you do
and and you should follow their advice
because their advice was different
what you should conclude is that the
experts don't know any more than you do
about what a stock is going to do in the
future which is true that's been well
demonstrated
so when the experts don't agree
your conclusion should be that's not
really a science it's not really it's
just a scam industry the financial
advice industry is a complete scam
industry
that for whatever reason well not
whatever reason because everybody who
treats it like it's real gets a lot of
money for doing it right the the TV
shows that have are the yeah mostly the
news but the the shows that have
um commercials from financial
institutions
that would be the same as like a hair
growth solutions
is that they know isn't real
right you don't think that the experts
on CNBC know that the experts they have
on don't know anything of course they
know that do you know why the experts on
CNBC know that the experts they have on
don't have useful information
because that's what every expert knows
the one thing every expert knows
correctly is that none of the experts
can predict
some will be right but that's because
everybody's predicting different things
of course some will be right then later
they'll say well look I was right for I
was the best predictor for three years
so let me handle your money you think
they'll be the best predictor for the
next three years
usually not
usually not because it's chance right
so the mental health professionals to be
look a lot like Financial professionals
which is I'll bet if you were if I if
you were yourself
a mental health professional you would
think that your own your own industry
was
prove me wrong
find somebody who works currently in
that industry and have a private
conversation with them because I did
that with somebody in the financial
advice industry and they told me flat
out now the advice I give my clients I
would never use for myself
flat out
no not even shaded a little bit no it's
it's basically a fake industry
all right um
uh I know you don't want me to
but there's something we need to say
about yay
can you handle it
a little bit
all right let me give you a little uh
walk in the park
of the history of yang
I want to see if
if you can put all of these little
pieces together into anything that feels
like a pattern
see if you can find the pattern okay
so you remember when uh yay interrupted
Taylor Swift's uh award-winning thing
and he got up there and instead of
letting the award ceremony progress in
this normal way
he got up there and said
probably
the main thing you should not say in
that situation
which is somebody else should have won
this award
right would you agree that whatever else
it was and you'll have lots of
descriptions of how bad it was would you
agree that he shouldn't have said it
can you all give me that
it was something that very specifically
you should not have said even if he
believed it
you shouldn't say it out loud in public
yeah
so that happened
do you know what uh yea was criticized
for when he was just doing music
do you remember what the biggest
criticism of va was when he was just the
artist doing music
anybody remember
because it's weird that you forgot
his songs were insanely misogynistic
said his critics
insanely misogynistic now
who thinks that in the last 20 years you
could be a public personality
and talk about women
and you could get away with it
so he said a lot of the stuff you're not
supposed to say about women
right
so he did that and and really like who
who goes after women like and just
insults them and makes money on it well
rappers so he comes from a world in
which saying the thing you're not
supposed to say
is exactly your job
right do you think rappers say what is
socially acceptable
I I feel like the essence of rap is
saying things that would be
uncomfortable for the people in charge
things about you know women things about
their feelings about police
maybe
um praising bad behavior illegal
behavior that sort of thing so rap
by his nature
is artists who are saying the most
dangerous things that you're
specifically not supposed to say
right
so that's part of the context well let's
move on do you remember of course you do
when yay said he likes Trump
wasn't that the one thing that a black
man couldn't say in public at the time
without huge consequences
it was it was like the most dangerous
thing a black man could say and he said
it over and over again
do you remember when yay went on uh
[Music]
I forget which show you'll tell me which
show because I'm blanking and he said
that slavery the history of slavery he
said there were so many more slaves than
there were masters of the time he said
that slavery looks like a choice
remember what happened when he said
slavery looks like a choice
he basically insulted
all of Black America and much of White
America and everybody else who might be
supportive and he said the worst thing
you could say about Black America
like I don't think you could have said a
worse thing
about Black Americans
and did he say I'm only talking about
some black people
when he said that when he was being
misogynistic did he say whoa whoa whoa
hold on no I'm not talking about women
I'm not talking about you know
to use his word I'm talking about some
individual women who have behaviors I
don't like did he ever clarify that I
don't think so
when he talked about black people
must have been a choice to slavery did
he say some of those black people must
have treated it like a choice
he didn't he treated like black people
or like a group that act together very
offensive wouldn't you say very
offensive yeah it was the worst thing
you could say in that situation
um
when yay made a turn toward being super
religious
and suddenly he wasn't that that edgy
rapper he was the Super religious guy
did it ever occur to you that that was
like the most dangerous thing that yay
could do
one of the most dangerous things you
could have done say two years ago
was the command as super Christian and
conservative family conservative
religious
it was just about the most dangerous
thing you could say in public
if you think about it right especially
from where he was coming from
most dangerous thing you could say
when he wore the White lives matter
shirt with Candace Owens
wasn't that the worst thing you could
say in public about that time
it was the most controversial worst
thing you could say yeah
now did he say that um
some white lives matter and some do not
I don't remember I think he treated
white people like they were
like one unit
but we're not right we're not one unit
there must be some white people that
don't matter
you know like serial killers and stuff
but yet he treated us all like we're
just one unit
very unfair so he's treated
women as if they're like one thing very
offensive
treated
um
he treated white people like one unit he
treated black people like they're one
group
um
and then he got to uh the Jews are
trying to stop him from being successful
wow
third rail it's the worst thing you
could say in public and expect to get
away with it
right the worst thing you could say
and he treated all Jews
like it's like one group of people when
in fact we knew that just some specific
individuals he had a problem with very
unacceptable treating an entire group as
if they're one thing
and then he took it up a level
you said I see good things about Hitler
well that's something you can't say
what is the worst thing you could say
the one thing nobody can say in public
Hitler has some good sides
you can't say that
it's the thing you can't say even with
free speech you can't say that
foreign
and then he teamed up with Nick Fuentes
and said you know Nick's great
oh you can't do that you cannot do that
and they started to work with Milo
yiannopoulos
you can't do that
no no you cannot say there's anything
good with Milo because if you do
it would feel like you're supporting
pedophiles wouldn't it
even though Milo is not accused of
pedophilia he is accused of something
that has a different word but people
confuse with pedophilia so he I think he
was talking about older older teens
which technically is not Peto but
everybody sees it that way right so I'm
not I'm not making that distinction I'm
saying that yea would know that people
won't make that distinction
so associating with Milo
put him in that sort of
little supportive of a pedophile
do you know what you can't say
you can never say anything anything this
even slightly
supportive
of the pedophile
so what do you say about Balenciaga when
they're accused of being a pedophile
organization
he defended them
not the specific photo shoot but he
defended the company
that is not defending itself from
pedophilia they're not defending
themselves
let me say it again
balenciago never said
how the photo shoot happened and
therefore explained why they're not
really guilty they never did
but yea defended
the group that is accused of being
pedophile friendly do you know what you
can't do you can't do that
but he did it
here's the pattern have you picked it up
yet
you see the pattern
and then another hint came when I
watched some more of the uh like behind
the scenes of yay's visit to Alex Jones
and you see Nick Fuentes
defending yay's treatment of quote the
Jews as like one group of people he has
trouble with
and here's what Fuente said
we're okay treating every other group as
one group
to which I said hey
that's so wrong
in ways I can't quite articulate
no no Nick Fuentes you racist
you
but your examples are pretty good but
that's wrong that's so wrong
except
makes you think doesn't it makes you
think
now if anybody's new to my live stream I
don't like Hitler
completely
like I I hate his little
mustache I ate the lint in his
pocket
he's all bad
because I know what to say in public
right
it's not hard now here's here's the
question that's going to blow your
 head off you ready
you ready for this
let's accept that yay has some mental
conditions maybe he's
you know maybe he's uh you know bipolar
maybe something else
do you think that any of the mental
conditions that yay is accused of
would make him incapable of knowing
what things to say to make him popular
with the public and what things to say
that would make him very unpopular with
the public do you think he can't tell
the difference
between saying the right thing
and saying the thing that will
absolutely get you in trouble
do you think you can't tell the
difference
somebody says yes that if it's Mania if
he's in the menu phase he can't tell the
difference
I would think the Mania phase means he's
not afraid of uh consequences
I don't think it makes you unable to see
what's right in front of you
so here's here's my take it seems deeply
unlikely that he was surprised by any of
the reactions to any of the things I
mentioned do you think he was surprised
by any of it now do you think he would
know exactly what to say and do if you
wanted to get back into the good graces
of the public
of course of course we all do it's not
it's not like it's a hard question it
would be the easiest question in the
world just say you didn't mean any of
those things apologize for it you know
do some good works for people you might
have hurt
that sort of thing
now what about the uh the perfectly
valid complaint from the Jewish
community
that yea's rhetoric puts an extra risk
on Jews
true or false the way yea talks
makes them feel uncomfortable and adds
some extra risk to their life true true
absolutely true now let's let's go fold
Nick Fuentes
and compare that to everybody else
talking about anything
do you think that the way the Democrats
talk about me
puts me at greater risk of literally
being killed
yes or no is the way they talk about me
on social media every day it will be a
risk of physical danger yes yes
absolutely have you ever seen me say
that they need to stop doing that
because it's putting me in physical
danger have I ever said that you need to
stop using your free speech because it
puts me in physical danger I've noted
that it does
I've noted that it does
but that's different than saying they
need to stop it
right not once no
um
when
when yay said White lives matter
was he putting himself at greater
physical risk of course he was of course
he was and also the people who supported
him
did he put Candace Owens at greater
physical Risk by you know associating
her with that message yes yes I mean she
already puts herself at Great Risk by
the way Candace Owens is one of the
bravest people
you know in the public realm like she is
brave like you gotta you gotta give her
that
um
so look at the big picture
number one how many of you saw the
behind the scenes video of yay preparing
his little mask
uh and his routine for
Alex Jones
if you watched him preparing for it you
saw somebody who did not look crazy at
all
and as he was talking about wearing the
mask he was completely aware that that
would make it impossible to ignore
he went full rock star
full Trump and he said all right if
you're gonna if you're gonna cut me off
from social media I will become
impossible to ignore and then I'm going
to go on there and say
the most outrageous thing anybody ever
said
and let's let's see what happens here's
another clue
uh Ali Alexander who's also Associated
now with with yay
um he said on that video
specifically that they were breaking the
Overton window
maybe saying it wrong but the Overton
window is basically the idea that you
could keep your
um your critics or your enemies in a
state of continuous spinning if you keep
doing one more outrageous thing after
another they can't settle on the last
outrageous thing they have to keep up
with you so sort of what Trump did
all of his individual uh you know
statements that could have ended anybody
else didn't end Trump because he was
already on to the next statement and
that was controversial too and then the
next one right
so now that you know the following
things
the baby you didn't put together
number one
Kanye and his group are specifically and
overtly talking about the Overton window
everything they're doing supports that
theory of operation
there's no way I could possibly believe
that yay was not completely aware of all
of the reactions he would get from
beginning to end
every everybody would know the reaction
to everybody
here's what I think he's up to
and you might pull it off
I don't know
now and and again if you're not if
you're new to my live stream I'm not
supporting yay
and I said this yesterday I think yay is
making himself unlikable
and I accept that so I don't like him I
would like him if he said nice things
about the Jewish community
I would like him more I would like him
if he were you know
said things that I could Embrace without
being embarrassed I'd like that
'd be cool
but uh here's what I think he's up to
I think he's breaking your brain
and he's going to be very close to
succeeding
because you you can't tell where that
breaking point is because he's bending
us and we're bending and bending and
bending
it's not until you see the whole
portfolio of what he's done in the last
few years
that you see he is intentionally finding
the most challenging thing you can hold
in your mind and then making you deal
with
now I've said before that yea is not
somebody who just creates art
he is living art
everything he does pushes pushes or
challenges you
to reconsider the way you were thinking
of things right everything we're
watching is a challenge
to the old way you were thinking from
from the very beginning of what is an
award show
right the most basic thing that nobody
would question is what is an award show
well it's where somebody gets an award
and they say thank you and everybody
claps then yay said how about this isn't
award show how about not how about I go
up there and make it a different show
and then he did
so if you look at the whole portfolio
it looks a lot less crazy
and it looks like an artist
who is breaking all of our expectations
about what artists can do who can say
what
and he has broken maybe the most
important barrier that we have for
getting together
which is we're not allowed to say what
we think
we're not allowed to say what we think
and until we're allowed to say what we
think we'll never come together
the country can never come together if
we can't talk and say what we actually
think
as bad as it is right because lots of
times we think pretty ugly things yea is
just breaking all of the rules he's just
showing you you can say everything you
want to say as long as you're willing to
pay for it with
everything
[Laughter]
now let's double back to something that
you really don't see coming you ready
for this
when ye said that there were so many
more slaves than white people who were
trying to control them back in slavery
you said that it looked like a choice
and then all historians and especially
black historians said whoa whoa whoa
whoa
that was no choice
you know the the group that had the
weapons would have just you know
slaughtered us right
here's what I think yay would have said
speculating based on all everything that
he's done so far
I think he'd say
right
how does that affect my point
right they would have slaughtered them
and they also probably would have ended
up winning they might have lost 90
percent of their numbers
but they could have ended up winning
them because they had the numbers you
know they they just had to attack where
their weapons were and get the weapons
and then you know
so if you ask me
yea's original controversial point
that the slaves could have rebelled if
they wanted to badly enough
he basically proved by destroying his
own career
to win back freedom of speech for
himself
he basically demonstrated what he
thought
the slaves at the time should have done
which is Risk Everything
for their freedom
and reasonable people said no you don't
risk everything for your freedom you
risk what makes sense
and the a was saying no for Freedom
you'd Risk Everything
and so when it came to his own freedom
in the United States can he say whatever
he wants to say
no matter how ugly it is
can a man who feels and this is his own
feeling this is not my interpretation
can a man who feels that some
identifiable group
seems to be ganging up on him can he say
it
yeah does he have the right to be wrong
does he have the right to say something
that could put people at risk
he's fighting for that right and what he
traded for that right
was everything
he traded everything for it
now if you don't think this is one of
the greatest shows
you've ever seen you're not seeing the
pattern
if you look at any individual thing he
says we're supposed to be outraged by it
you're part of the performance right
you're not an observer you're part of
the performance your outrage
is part of the ACT
so what he says Hitler has some good
things about him I say God damn you yay
God damn you I'm sorry I don't want to
use the lord's name in vain I know some
of you get triggered by that and I
didn't mean to do it
so
I don't support him
because that's his message
his message to me is don't support me
right because he basically said things I
can't agree with
and I'm not going to agree with
so I don't support him but watching
watching this play out
 amazing
now you want some more mind benders I
got more
do you think he can make his money back
do you think he could ever make his
money back
well one of his projects which is still
live
unless something's changed recently is
you know he had intended to build uh
communities that were designed
communities so they'd be better places
to live and would solve you know a
number of problems that our current
social situation doesn't solve
now uh he's only been messing around
with the prototypes
but you know the size of that market
is bigger than all the things he's ever
done
right the potential size of that is
is basically Elon Musk sized opportunity
and nobody's nobody's really competing
because other people who want to build
homes are just going to be home builders
and they would build something boring
that didn't move your soul
yay
potentially
potentially
could bring what he's brought to other
fields
to the housing field and make you
excited about it and then suddenly every
Community bills or license he makes a
hundred million dollars
and you know 100 million here 100
million there it adds up over time you
know he could be the richest man in
America in 20 years
and it's because he's entered the market
that would allow that to happen and he's
the right person for IT he's the right
person for the market
[Music]
so
here's the other possibility
you know that in my opinion Trump has
become
um
not viable
is there any way that yay could come
back from all of this
could he come back from the things he
said could he get back into the public
good graces
nobody else could
but he could
he could yep now I'm not going to
predict that they will
I'm just going to say I look at his
talent stack
and I look at what what you would call
his mental illness or whatever's going
on there
and I don't see that's going to stop him
it doesn't look like that would stop him
he knows exactly what it would take
right don't you think he knows what to
take because because he knew exactly
what would get him in trouble
you don't think there was any surprise
about that he knew exactly what he was
doing you don't think he knows exactly
how to get out of it
let me tell you how
do you think I could model it do you
think I could give you a thing he could
say that would just totally get him out
of the out of trouble
I think he could
here's me modeling it
you know
um
I think that my comments about the Jews
were out of place
and I was acting on my feelings at the
time
however the bigger issue is can people
say what they feel when they feel it and
still survive in this country because we
can't have a country
if I can't say something out of anger
and still have a job
and I'd like that for you as well
I want us all to live in the country at
work and say what we want to say
and we'll figure out a way to be okay
with it we shouldn't be doing things
that make it too dangerous for other
people but be aware that all speech
comes with a little bit of danger
right it's it's built into Free Speech
you can't make it go away
you've watched me say every possible
thing that you're not supposed to say
and so far I'm still alive
Free Speech won't kill you I just proved
it
now can we stop saying bad things about
each other as a group
can you join me and let's not treat
black people like their one group or
white people like their one group or
Jews like their one group or Christians
like they're one group can we just stop
doing it
because I'll go first
I'll go first
now if he said that and you said to
yourself
huh
he actually sounds like he means it
he actually I I could hear his actual
regret
and the way he phrase it he's giving us
a reason why it happened
he was upset about his situation
he's he's told you what he's going to do
to correct it
and then he he tried to bring you to a
higher ground where we all don't have
that problem and we don't have that kind
of problem with each other and we figure
out how to talk while being a little bit
offensive because that's just how
talking works
foreign
now you don't think he could sell that
again I'm not predicting he will try to
do anything like that because he's hard
to predict right you can't really
predict him if you could predict him he
wouldn't be gay
but he could
now when I said that did you say to
myself oh my God that will never work
nobody would ever accept that
have you ever heard the uh
well there's a couple of analogies that
come to mind
um
if if you've ever worked at a restaurant
you know or any retail you know that the
following thing is true
the best way to get a repeat customer
is have a bad experience for your
customer and then they complained and
then you fix it
if for example you go to a restaurant
and something was wrong and they comp
you the meal your odds of eating there
again are pretty high
you know if it's a good restaurant you
just have one little issue right
so
yeah
we do have a soft spot as humans for
people who admit their mistake and try
to fix it
in fact that's some of our favorite
people
a lot of movies and books are about
somebody who is flawed and then the
process of the movie they redeem
themselves right the the Redemption
story is one of our strongest
most built-in you know narratives that
run our run our lives so if he could
turn into the reformed person
who becomes the the story of who you
don't want to be or becomes the the
reason that we should
you know value Free Speech or something
like that you can imagine he could make
it work
you can imagine
that does it blow your mind
that he's a black man who says white
lives matter and he's working with
Nick Fuentes
and Milo
doesn't it look like he chose he chose
his group to be the most offensive group
he possibly could and Ali Alexander was
one of the organizers of the January 6
event he's not charged with anything
because he didn't do anything illegal
um but still his name is associated with
that right doesn't it look like he
intentionally chose the least
publicly
acceptable people
here's the weird thing they're not all
the same person
so he's got you know person of color
person who's gay person who's you know
the the most extreme right-wing person
I mean he's really got a little pirate
yeah it's a pirate ship his little
pirate ship
do you know what makes people
comfortable
people get comfortable
when they see that you're the captain of
a pirate ship
because they go well he's not going to
kick me out for being weird
because I'm just a pirate
like all the Pirates are different one
has one leg one has one leg but we're
all just Pirates
you know the the pirate ship
um
metaphor or analogy I forget which
it would be a good way to bring the
country together wouldn't it
you know instead of saying you're a bad
pirate and I'm a good pirate
how about just saying you know we're all
kind of pirates but we're on the same
ship
that's what I liked about Trump
yeah you know of course his critics say
oh you're a big racist but he had no
problem hanging out with literally
anybody
right
if you look at the people Trump has
personally associated with it was
everybody no limits at all
I love that uh the the people I'm
worried about is people hanging around
with people who look like them I'm not
comfortable with that
what is one piece I don't know what that
is
uh are you giving him the benefit to
talk about yay am I giving yay the
benefit of a doubt and assuming his
attentions are good uh yes
yes I am doing that explicitly I'm
assuming that yay's intentions are good
because I also believe that his
religious faith is real
does anybody doubt his religious faith
that's a lot of work I mean if that's a
if that's a trick it's a lot of work to
put into a trick
no I think he's I think he's completely
sincere about the religion stuff
which suggests he's sincere about
creating a better world he's just doing
it in a way that we've never seen
anybody do anything
unless you think Trump did
all right
um
now is there any way that I can say what
I've said without getting smeared by the
left I think they'll probably drag me
now won't they do you think I'll get
dragged by this afternoon
because I think I think the media is
desperately looking for somebody who
makes a mistake of Defending yay right
like the classic trap is the first
person who looks like they're defending
him is going to get dragged in so that
you know not to defend him
that's how it's played
now I don't know if I can uh if I can
avoid that by saying I dislike him
because he is going out of his way to
make all of us dislike him so I accept I
accept his message
all right
uh yeah the locals is our pirate ship
that
Scott your struggles are uncertain comp
okay
um
my comp oh my struggle I got it got it
took me a while to put that together
um
he's trying to destroy his brand I don't
know
I mean he's already done that
as something wrong
there's an article already about me
is there already had peace on me yet
does anybody seem to have peace on me
yet
probably there should be one by the end
of today
that would be the normal thing but I
think they'll probably just keep yay end
of the news now here's here's the other
possibility
do you think yay would run as a Democrat
or a Republican
because he hasn't said right
what do you think
I feel like he's going to have to start
his own party isn't he
because he already said he's the
birthday party or something yeah he's a
birthday party I don't know what you
have to do to officially be a new
political party but
but uh who would yay take more votes
away from
Democrats are Republicans who would yay
take more votes away from
you think he could get black votes
after you said White lives matter
I think you're right
I think he I think he could pull more
away from the Democrats
which would make him the Joe manchin of
presidential candidates
in other words Joe manchin just by being
the one person or one of two who can go
back and forth on an issue guests to
decide all our legislation
so maybe yay could run for office and
know that his his involvement would
change the
the result what do you think the
Democrats would be willing to offer him
to stop running
they might fund his yay community
just to get him out of the race
I don't know it could be interesting but
ladies and gentlemen that is all I have
for now for the Public Presentation so
I'm going to say uh
good night to two or good day good day
to YouTube and Spotify and Rumble and
I'm going to talk to the locals people
privately bye for now
