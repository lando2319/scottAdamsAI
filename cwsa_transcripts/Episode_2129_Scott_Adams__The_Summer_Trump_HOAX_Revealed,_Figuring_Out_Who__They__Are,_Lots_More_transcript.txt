well good morning
anybody coming in here today
I'm going to start up the local stream
you know what maybe we'll just start
early today
well it seems I've accidentally turned
on my
YouTube feed 10 minutes before I needed
to because I pushed the wrong button
and it looks like it's going to be about
10 minutes before people come in here
let me uh toss an idea around
all right we're already live this
morning
I was going to do a spaces
today
and I was going to do the spaces on the
on the topic of the global Elites we're
controlling the world
and uh maybe you could talk me into it
we'll go private all right that should
work
um what do you think of that
is there anybody who needs to get their
coffee before we go live
well we are live but we're not we're not
official until the top of the hour
do you think we should just go ahead and
act like it it's a normal start
well you better get your coffee ready
you've got a few minutes we're going to
do the simultaneous sip in eight minutes
until then
if anybody has any questions before the
show
I will take them
you've been living in w e f hell okay
all right then
look for dual citizenship you say
Steve Garvey for a second is that
happening
have I heard of Ray kurz well and what
do I think of him well raker as well and
I are in a heated competition
to see who can live forever first
I know that doesn't make any sense but I
said it anyway
yeah I think Rick Roswell thinks that if
he reaches a certain age and he's still
healthy the technology will allow him to
live forever
it is pretty healthy so far I think it
takes a lot of supplements
but I'm trying to beat him I'm going to
try to try to be immortal before he is
he had a stroke oh
okay well that's no good
uh ruling on vessels that come
pre-filled with liquid those would be
acceptable yeah a pre-filled vessel of
liquid
can you solve a Rubik's Cube
you know I don't know
and the reason I don't know is I've
never thought that was a good use of
time
I I assume it takes some time to learn
how to do it and I've never thought that
that could possibly be worth my time
it looks impressive if you become one of
those people who can do it quickly
but
yeah
yeah it's sort of pattern recognition
you'd have to know the trick
um
you think technology can push the supply
demand curve to solve our economic
problems
well so far technology has solved all of
Humanity's problems got us to here
so why would it change
uh did I ever find a competent plumber
that's a long story all of my Plumbing
woes
all right
uh it was the biblical
so I'm still testing my uh magnesium
experiment
so far so good
a self-defense tactical coffee mug
there's an idea cases of home invasion
and you need to protect yourself with
your coffee mug
that's okay we need to work on that the
Tactical self-defense coffee mug
made of some kind of titanium
do I really have a swimming pool that
looks like Dilbert I do not no
I do not have a swimming pool that looks
like Dilbert
what I do have
is a structural effect
near the swimming pool that looks like
Dilbert's head so it looks like
Dilbert's watching the swimming pool but
it's not it's not the swimming pool
itself
potassium is important as magnesium
concierge medicine maybe thinking about
it
would I take a picture
um
might have one somewhere
how's your blood pressure have to check
it
the Magnesium should lower the blood
pressure too
I decided to stop checking it
I suppose that's a bad idea
have I ever chatted with Seth MacFarlane
I have not
don't expect that to happen
Epsom salts are a magnesium what
how many pickleball courts per tennis
court I'm not even sure people have
decided how big a pickleball court is
there are different sizes
um
Vivek you have a fake Community noted
but I'll talk about that
the Scott Adams gag on Family Guy might
be about race
was there a new Scott Adams gag on
Family Guy
now that can't be true
there's some old ones I know they mocked
me in the old days
um
oh you listen when you went to bed okay
in Greece
is the Denver principle more relevant
now
uh I don't know it's a good question I
haven't read it in a while
it might be might be the one of the few
uh books of mine that you can buy at the
moment
two minutes
all right we're gonna get serious in two
minutes
the way of the weasel is you like that
um
circles within circles I don't know what
you're talking about
Epsom salts are magnesium sulfate
what's my favorite book that I've
written
uh well it would be a toss-up between
God's debris and had failed almost
everything and still went big although
you're gonna like the new one the new
one is just going to rip the
rip the top off of civilization
stop chuckling about your books
unpublished and do something to
self-publish them well it's called
independent publishing we don't call it
self-publishing anymore and it's well
along in the process there's some things
that just take a while the the new book
had to be edited and the how to fail
book is being re-edited as we speak
so both of them should be available the
two ones that
we care about the most should both be
available at the end of the summer
or sooner
am I using AI to write no
but maybe someday
yeah we'll do an audiobook too
there will be an audiobook I just
have to get it done
uh yeah it'll be on Amazon you can buy
it the usual way audiobook we'll do a
we'll do an e-book and an audiobook and
all that all right ladies and gentlemen
pretend that we've been not live until
this moment are you ready
it's time
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization is called
coffee with Scott Adams and you're so
happy to be here I can tell I can see it
in your face now if you'd like to take
this experience up to a level where
nobody could even imagine how good it
could be well all you need is a cup of
mugger glass detector cell system Joker
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamines into the thing
today they the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
ah
that's good
all right well
the most important story of the day egg
prices are coming back to normal that's
right people our Long Winter of Despair
is over
the uh the covered pandemic is over and
the price of eggs
almost back to normal how's your gas
prices
have you noticed that your gas prices
are high
but they're not so high as they used to
be so it doesn't seem so bad anymore
you're coming down a little bit they're
still terrible
but things are moving in the right
direction as I always tell you
if you get the jobs right
the economy follows and so far
surprisingly jobs are robust
so we're doing okay
um
you know that I was speculating what
will be the summer Trump hoax
as you know the summer is a slow news
period a lot of people on vacation so
they like to cover that period with a
good hoax something that you can't prove
but you can't disprove
and we can we can see the bones of that
now now it is obvious what that will be
it looks like it's going to be document
hoax
Trump Mar-A-Lago document hoax now a
good hoax in the political sphere
involves somebody saw something and
they're telling you about it
um
they're telling you about it
but you can't prove or or test whether
it's real or not
so now we're told that maybe there was
something that Trump said about one of
the documents that would suggest that he
knew there was a process
he knew there was a process he didn't
follow it except the process that he
knows is the one where he says if I take
it out of the White House it's
unclassified but that's why he'll argue
with the court
so the first claim will be there's
there's a reference to something that
shows that he knew he was taking them
but he shouldn't have
so that's the first part the second part
will be what is the nature of the
document that's like the real dangerous
one and that we're being told by people
who can't show us the documents that it
might be about something about an attack
on a rayon
oh
that's espionage
that's very espionage
so we're going to have to listen All
Summer Long
to about what's in the
documents based on somebody saw it or
somebody heard something and we don't we
can't get any confirmation of anything
and it will last all summer
all summer it's going to be wall-to-wall
MSNBC CNN what could be in that document
what could it possibly say about Iran oh
it's so espionage
and that word espionage
you're just going to hear it all the
time
and here's the funny thing
does anybody really think
that Trump was involved in espionage
and we got to the point where the
Democrats actually believed that like
that like that's a
that's a hypothetical true thing oh yeah
maybe possibly yeah I mean totally
feasible after all he did he did urinate
on that hooker's bad so this was oh wait
he didn't he didn't that was fake yeah
well he did call uh Nazis fine people oh
actually he didn't by the way AI now
knows that I saw one version of AI where
it very clearly sent the fine people
thing was a hoax
so it does now even even AI knows that
was those
um so that's what we have to look
forward all summer long oh it's going to
be a bad one what's in the box ask me
and I
well Allstate has joined the State Farm
in not offering homeowner insurance for
Californians
the problem here being
not just that there are a lot of losses
in California with forest fires
but that California doesn't let them uh
set their rates based on what they
expect the losses will be
just hold that in your mind California
uniquely uniquely it's the only one
tells the insurance company that they
cannot set their insurance prices
based on what they anticipate is their
risk
also known as the entire point
of insurance
is that they set the price
based on their perceived risk and
they're not allowed to do that in
California they have to set it on uh
historical risks
and the historical risks include when we
used to manage the forest fires better
and you know it wasn't so dry and all
that other stuff so basically we have an
absurd system which guarantees that two
of the biggest insurers can't even work
in our state at least for nuke I think
it's for new houses I think they'll
still service the old ones
all right well uh how about that
Ukrainian defensive
everybody everybody Ukrainian offensive
it's happening any day now right oh they
are so ready you know last week they
were ready
but now they're readier
uh next week we're looking for well it's
just a forecast but super ready the week
after that extra extra superlatively
ready and then sometime after that
Platinum level readiness
they're very ready
so that's going to happen anytime
now as you know 100 of the news I know
of Ukraine and Russia is undependable
highly undependable
but that doesn't stop us from talking
about it like it's some kind of hobby
and there's an account I follow that
suggests that Russia is running out of
artillery
that they started with nine thousand
uh they would keep three thousand in
reserve in case they have some other ore
three thousand are broken
they got three thousand left and maybe
only a thousand
and the problem is that they break and
they they can't make them as quickly as
they can as they break them so artillery
can't fire forever the barrel the barrel
gets sketchy after a while
so they basically fired all their
artillery until they don't have much
left
and it looks like one of the things that
Ukraine might be waiting for is for
Russia to run out of artillery
now
would you like to jump in and say Scott
that information from the Ukraine war is
inaccurate
would that be like a surprising claim
am I claiming that everything I just
said is true
nothing about Ukraine is believable but
you should know that there's one
hypothesis from somebody who seems to
follow War stuff pretty closely and
seems to be an expert
who says that Russia can't make new
artillery
they they can only make like a few
pieces a year or something it's crazy
and they're running out
and that Ukraine is amassing a
overwhelming advantage
what do you think do you think Ukraine
will have an overwhelming advantage and
be able to at least push through and say
one place oh the other part about the
artillery is if if it's true that
they're down to a thousand or whatever
it is and then you spread it out over
the entire territory they're protecting
it's almost like they don't have any
you know by the time it's spread out
over the entire front line
uh Scott please try reading sources that
present both sides
Scott
so Scott made that comment to Scott it's
another Scott
please stop recommending that I read
both sides
please stop that
please stop recommending that I listened
to Scott Ritter
okay uh can I would you allow me to
represent the entire other side
Russia is winning and Russia will win
are you happy now
are you happy what because I wasn't
clear enough when I said that nothing
that comes out of Ukraine can be
believed so after I said nothing can be
believed out of Ukraine you felt it was
necessary to tell me to listen to the
other side because the side I told you
wasn't credible
there is there anything you can say
about Ukraine without somebody bitching
that I didn't tell you Russia is going
to win how about every time I
talk about Russia I do a dance I'm going
to do a little Russian dance
where I say Russia's going to win
Russia's going to win and then can I
talk about it then can I talk about it
would that be okay
all right
you know one of the things I like about
Kamala Harris in the office
is that you can tell what things the
Biden Administration doesn't care about
at all
uh so if they put her in charge of it
they really don't care
so they put Kamala in charge of the
Border
and it's pretty obvious they don't give
a about that
and then they put her in charge of AI
when she is AI
I mean if she's not an NPC I've never
seen one
so
I feel like that's really just throwing
it away
I'm in the Bible Administration
basically took this existential risk
and then put in charge of it the least
trusted person in all of public office
am I wrong about that
wouldn't you say that Kamala Harris
would be the least trusted public
official
well maybe Adam Schiff would be less no
Adam's just would be more probably
yeah she she might be the least capable
person
in all of government and we just put her
in charge of the two most critical
issues of the day
right right in front of us they're not
even hiding that
they're doing that right in front of us
oh the window oh you're right
good call
it is dark
I always have the window shades down but
sometimes I forget to turn on my
lighting
okay how about that huh
much better
it's all new now let's start over
I saw a tweet there's a story about a
new AI app
and I thought to myself wow
could there be an AI app that is not
overrated and disappointing
and does what you wanted to do and this
and this one apparently is one of the
biggest AI apps now it's just getting
tons of download and it's called
character.ai and listen to this
it can chat with you
you know all day long you can just chat
with it but it does it in the style of
famous people
so we can chat as Elon Musk it can chat
as Einstein and it can chat as a few
other people that they mentioned so I
said to myself oh my God
that sounds awesome can you imagine can
you imagine chatting with AI like having
a little friend and it's like Elon Musk
just talks like Elon Musk I thought to
myself finally
that might be that and they said lots of
people using it like 29 minutes they're
using it so I thought wow I gotta
download that so I downloaded it today
to be wowed by this new AI app and
uh um then I find out that the famous
people who were named in the article are
pretty much the only famous people
so I thought to myself I've got to get
myself out Kate Beckinsale Ai and have
something to chat with all day
and then it says uh oh no it's just
basically four famous people that we
already mentioned like Michael Jackson
Napoleon Bonaparte Mark Zuckerberg
Tony Stark Elon Musk
and the others are just people you
haven't heard of
so it turns out it's not an app where I
can talk to a wide variety of famous
people
it's an app in which I could talk to a
very small variety of people that do not
impress me whatsoever
who wants a rap to sound like Elon Musk
or Mark Zuckerberg
if somebody created a Mark Zuckerberg
sounding app would you buy it
hey I got an app it's gonna say hey it
does some useful things but not only
does it you do useful things but it will
sound like Mark Zuckerberg
how about that
no seriously it'll sound just like Mark
Zuckerberg no you want it now
it's like
all right so then I said all right I'm
going to start talking to this thing so
I look for the button that would sort of
activate the conversation part and then
I find out you don't talk to it
no when it says it answers you in the
style of Elon Musk or
Mark Zuckerberg it means that chat's in
text
the way they would
it's taxed there's no voice
it's text
and let me give you uh
let's see we'll we'll get a chat all
right
uh oh I was chatting and the Elon Musk
one was telling me that I was boring it
that's all it did
chat it back to me so that's that's like
the hottest AI app and all it is is like
it texts you with lame little things
that might might have been said by those
people
all right uh there's a this will tell
you what a slow news date is
there's a story about the Vivek
ramaswamy and something about DeSantis
and the criticism and then Twitter
tried to community notes in but maybe
the community knows
I don't know
it's the smallest story in the world
about somebody running for president
said something that somebody didn't like
Community notes said something there's
just nothing there forget it
uh there's some fake news about Ivanka
Trump
uh take a load of this one this is
something that Democrats are believing
so at least if you believe uh Twitter so
the bunch of tweets on this
and the Tweet is that Ivanka Trump is
having so much trouble with her last
name being Trump that she wants to
change it to Kushner
so that she won't be
you know so recognized
is that the fakest news you've ever
heard in your life
because first of all who's going to be
fooled by Ivanka Kushner he imagined
meeting her for the first time and this
is a Ivanka Kushner you'd be like
Ivanka Kushner
why have I heard that's like familiar
you look familiar where have I seen you
where have I seen you
and then Ivanka would say
I I don't know I'm I've just always been
Ivanka Kushner
and you'd say ah you're reminding me of
somebody though who
but you know then everything would be
good because they wouldn't know who she
was
so yeah that's a totally true story
that's absolutely going to happen sure
in other news the Tesla Model 3 life
cycle cost might be one of the cheapest
cars in America
how about that I know you don't believe
it it's okay
because economics is not real it's just
people make up assumptions and can prove
anything they want so yeah so that would
include substance of these and include a
whole life cycle cost from
resale value to I don't know I don't
know if it included recycling batteries
or not but uh
the good news is that although it might
be a higher sticker price the Tesla
Model 3 might be the cheapest car in
America
didn't see that covered did you
did not see that coming
um I don't know if it's true though
that's just one one analysis
so as uh Chad was somebody who said that
he does not like the digital uh currency
idea and a lot of you would agree right
you don't like digital currency
because you lose your privacy and the
government can turn you off
so I asked what the alternative was
because you know paper money's gonna go
away right there's no way you're gonna
have paper money in 100 years
so what's the alternative and so uh Jam
rocker who I was talking to on Twitter
said that he prefers a bartering system
so if his only choice is digital money
he's going to leave the economy and go
to a bartering system
so what he pays his mortgage for example
he would pay that in chickens
that's his plan so that way you won't
have to put up with a digital currency
anybody else want to do that plan pay
for your mortgage and chickens
a little bartering
so that's a pretty practical plan so
it's a good it's a good thing that we
don't have to put up with digital
currency we have this alternative where
we can trade uh let's say uh
Butter Churn or maybe if you had carved
something out of a stick
you could you could trade that for
things that you could eat
so you have options
all right
um
I was thinking of this idea of creating
a spaces which is the audio service on
Twitter
in which I would ask people to convince
me that there's a global Elite cabal
running everything and how that all
works
if I did this right here could you hear
it if I just played it through my phone
because I can do it right now because
there's not much to talk about
you want to do it right now
let's see
let's see
all right I had it all set up and then
it disappeared
so I'm going to say uh explain to
Scott Adams
who
quote they are
they are
who are running
or trying to control you
trying to
control you
[Music]
all right explain to Scott Adams who
they are who are trying to control you
will record it
and
uh what do you think of this idea is
this going to work let's try this if you
can't hear it because I'll just be
playing the audio through my phone
foreign
if you can't hear it let me know
all right
so that music says it started I guess
and oh look at all those people just
popped up
hey everybody
welcome to spaces today's topic will be
you convincing me
that there is a group of global Elites
who are trying to control you
and uh and you're going to explain that
to me in ways that make total sense so
who would like to go first
oh yeah we're talking about Davos and
Bilderberg
wef and all that I want to look for
somebody who uh
will be brave enough
to all right raise your hands if you
want to talk
anybody want to talk
I believe I should see that request I
see one request
from Paul
let's see add a speaker
Paul can you hear me
good morning Scott good morning Paul
are you gonna argue or or explain to me
who the global Elites are
all right who who are the global Elites
and why are they trying to control me
who are they
you've named you've named some of it you
know the bilderbergs uh the trilateral
commission the club of Rome
basically uh any anybody that lady that
we know their name of they're down the
puppet strings from whoever we don't
know their name of and what I actually
suspect is that non-human entities or
demonic entities might be influencing
the uh agenda
so demonic entities
do you believe that there are non-humans
who are controlling the global Elites
so not non-humans in physical form like
actual Devils walking the Earth
uh not that we could like see with our
eyes but uh
but uh we're like uh inter-dimensional
beings interdimensional but that but uh
but the interdimensional beings
would be able to uh control our actions
even though they're in another dimension
they can control us from there
heinous acts in order to get like
pseudo-spiritual power
uh because these Global Elites they they
they hate the idea of God or they wish
to mock God and make themselves God so
yeah I think that they I think that they
they uh
make some sort of Faustian Bargains with
um demonic uh well hold on entities hold
on yeah so so the so the global Elites
would want to be God but they would be
working with the demons and the Devils
to do that
oh don't the demons and the Devils want
to be in charge why would the demons and
the Devils want to make people Gods who
would sort of be their own bosses then
do a bargain and control it but they
can't it's it's a it's a it's a Fool's
errand all right so they so the global
League think that they will win
but they're really being fooled by the
demons and the Devils or the or the evil
and what would be the evidence for the
the demon devil hypothesis
[Applause]
Gene Island ties into that
into the child sacrifice you know child
sacrifice has been around for thousands
of years it's not this new phenomenon
and if we were serious we would get to
the bottom of who was part of that but
hello most of the global Elites I think
are tied up in that blackmail scheme are
you where you don't rise to that unless
you so there's a blackmail on you wait
so there's a global blackmail scheme uh
Global pedophiles and are the global
pedophiles under the control of the this
the demons and the evil forces
or they are the devil forces
I think that they open themselves their
Consciousness up to be influenced and
controlled yes five demonic forces
demonic forces all right thank you Paul
I'm going to see if anyone thank you sir
all right thank you
all right so let's see who else we got
four more requests here
uh
let's do David
you're coming in hot David Swanson are
you there
David
hello
you always have to wait for people to
unmute that's one of the problems with
spaces
David are you there I am I am wow thank
you
um and fan for a long time yeah yeah
well thank you now uh do you buy into
the demons and evil controlling the
global Elite or do you have a different
take on it
see it with a lot of stuff right now
when there are big decisions and they
can go either way and sometimes all you
have is bad outcomes and you're trying
to
get all of Humanity on the same page
sometimes the decision you make would be
you know perceived as evil and there's
certain cases where Market manipulation
by forces happens
um you know when we take the Ukraine war
right now did that need does that need
to get this bad with all these people
killing each other because there have
been a different outcome at the
beginning
I don't know I think so I think so I
wouldn't have liked to have seen that
happen and some people would say well
because you know the Bible
Administration took that they're in bed
with the devil group
um
yeah
um I think that uh are are they physical
I don't know I think there's a lot of
questions that
um we have right now that maybe should
should not be able to be asked but are
there are there forces where people are
taking advantage and and doing uh
what I would say bad things to innocent
people yes but you know is that evidence
of like a a devily a devily cult or is
that just the path that they are they
are going down I don't think we have
evidence of
I don't think that we have evidence that
there's you know horn devil Minotaur
guys running around
um I don't think we have evident at
least I haven't seen that but are there
obviously some bad people out there and
sometimes they operate
um and they have control of very uh big
apparatuses that can get a lot of action
done yeah yeah I think we can agree on
that
um okay so so there are definitely
outcomes but we don't know if there are
devils behind it there are bad outcomes
but we don't know if it's a just a
outcome of a bunch of people pursuing
their selfish interests
but it looks doubly
because it's not
imaginary demands like a uh
a consensus of a of a couple of people
in in various factions I'm not about to
name names but you okay you know to get
anything big done it can't just be an
individual so all right yeah thank you
I'm going to see if we can call somebody
else appear
thank you Scott thank you thanks
all right let's see who else we got here
we've got seven requests
and I want to see if I can get the most
Lively interesting person on here
the general cuss words is here
all right
we'll see how the dialogue
hold on I've got somebody still
David Stillman
all right removing you
all right let me find a new person here
we'll go with uh Zara
Zara you're coming in do you hear me
hello Zara
Zara unmute your microphone
this is just the biggest problem with
spaces
that the people who are waiting to speak
are not ready to speak
so looks like that's not happening
oh there you are Zara uh you want to
weigh in on the question of the global
Elites and whether or not there are
demons and Devils controlling them
yeah
um the audio all changed on me when I
came on here so sorry about that that's
another tech issue but uh
so I'm I'm uh it's interesting that
people are bringing up Devils I'm not
sure about that but authoritarian
structures they're in the business of
trying to control people
so you can expect that their motivations
are to like if your job was to stop
people from robbing and murdering you
could do that easier if you could read
everybody's email and so is the question
is there a group of people trying to
manipulate and control
the rest of us I mean isn't that is that
hard to prove or is that the question or
am I missing the question well wouldn't
you say that we're all trying to
manipulate everybody all the time and if
you have more power you're manipulating
more people but aren't we all
manipulating everybody all the time
that's basically just called life that's
exactly
there
is there a contention for that like I
don't think of that as like some evil
cabal of people twisting a mustache the
question it's a free marketing people
about it should be why is it working on
me like if it works on my neighbors and
whatever the Deep state or whatever it
is that you think is behind it even if
it's Devils if it works on you and your
neighbors and they give it up well then
China Russia Saudi Arabia somebody else
is going to do it the fact that it's
working is something that you could fix
instead of trying to figure out who the
people are that are doing it
okay do you think that the big Global
groups
are all together or do you think they're
operating independently in other words
it's Davos in the Bilderberg are they
all the same team there's a whole bunch
of different people with different
interests fighting to manipulate the
world just exactly the way you described
it from like the Grassroots up okay
it sounds like you're pretty much on my
page thank you for that and I will uh
see if I can find somebody who can
disagree with me a little more we want a
little disagreement going down here
thanks Sarah
all right let's get some disagreeing
all right um I saw a comment just on
YouTube while I was watching that uh the
real question is things like ESG you
know Dei and the various programs that
get uh you know the let's say that Davos
people get infected with and then they
spread it everywhere now we all know
that that's happening
but I'm looking for the evil the evil
part right there's things we don't like
there's no doubt there are things we
don't like that some people think are
good and some people think they're bad
but that's not anything that's just
business as normal
so let's see who else we got here
all right
let's talk to
it's hard to find who who you think will
be the most interesting person but we'll
just go with the top here all right
James Bowery you're coming in
we're adding you a speaker
James
weigh in please James James are you
there
yes I am hey great technology is working
what's your take on this is there a big
Global Elite and are they run by demons
and devils
there is one demon that's an artificial
general intelligence that is turning
people into sterile worker mechanical
Turks it's called the global economy
okay the global economy you're calling
it intelligence
but but you being that it's sort of
accidentally intelligent because it's
just how we have designed the world
economy
right right
people are worried about artificial
general intelligence being unfriendly
right
um that's one worry yes
well it's a pretty big deal right now
yeah yes
so under what circumstances would people
say oh we now see there's an emergent
artificial general intelligence that is
unfriendly to us could it be when we are
stopping to having children
uh so I okay I like this I like the
direction you're going if you were to
look at all the things that are in fact
happening such as the reduction in birth
rates Etc
you would say that the um let's say the
circumstantial evidence is overwhelming
that there must be some kind of
centralized intelligent control
uh over all of it because it's all
heading in one direction does that sound
right
I would say more along the lines of
unfriendly artificial general
intelligence are not necessarily aligned
with anything that's of human value
like for example the paper clip
maximizer doesn't really have evil
intent it's just maximizing to a bad
utility function then how would uh let's
say that let's say ESG let's take that
for example do you think that the uh
this intelligence which you speculate is
already operating
do you believe that it was behind ESG or
the world economic Forum or 15-minute
cities is it behind all that stuff
is more like a
unintended consequence that is a result
of the way human
preferences operate
within the incentive structures that
exist so you'll have for example a
centralized point of uh emission of the
world Reserve currency which must
increase with the increase in the world
economy and the pla the way in which
it's introduced into the world economy
is from Central points generally the
Western power centers like Wall Street
and Washington DC and so those people
get first crack at any new issuance of
money going into the global economy as
it's growing and those people are
insulated for the consequences of their
decisions by virtue of the fact that
they have all this money and so they
just start degenerating their behaviors
and ESG is just an example of that let
me let me ask you this do you do you
believe the global Elites
in their minds think that they
personally can make more money and have
more control
by reducing the economic activity of the
planet
by doing things that are harmful to the
economic well harmful to the free market
do you think they think they can make
more money
without the free market
are in general just engaging in Virtual
signaling but they don't actually
support things that are good for the
environment they don't actually care
about reducing economic activity in fact
they actually want economic activity to
increase
they're simply one one way of thinking
about this is wire heading and the AGI
terms people like to talk about the
danger of AGI going into a mode that's
wire hitting in other words it is
bypassed a normal mechanisms by which it
can be reinforced and going gone
straight to its own pleasure centers
people are doing that when they are
insulated from the consequences of their
own behavior by virtue of the fact that
they have get more and more World
Reserve currency as the global economy
expands so they're completely
disconnected from their statements they
just simply behave in such a way that
they are
basically just wire heading they're
they're fentanyl addicts in essence
but it's going to point to a a source of
maybe uh nefarious motives on the part
of humans and all this I I'd say perhaps
China has figured out
ways in which you can encourage these
kinds of degenerate behaviors on the
part of people who are in positions of
power
so for example you would get the
Libertarians and reason magazine Melissa
substitute Etc uh saying that there is
no such thing as a natural monopoly for
the purpose of creating more and more
Network effect monopolies in Silicon
Valley which could then censor things
and engage in all kinds of degenerate
Behavior so you think China might be
behind the growth of social media in the
United States
perfect monopolies are not in fact
monopolies and should not be treated as
inimical to our general interests it's
sort of like
saying to the private sector yeah here's
your fentanyl you know start start
indulging in your Fentanyl and get guys
like Scott Adams to investigate
Monopoly so so you speculate it might be
China but do you do you believe that it
is coordinated from Some central place
whether China or some place else I'm
just saying that there are there are
going to be places that really look like
they are sort of the elite in this whole
thing
and some of them are going to be better
at this kind of behavior than others the
ESG guys are just idiots I don't think
China is as stupid but I think that
China's loss of birth rate is evidence
that they too are sort of wire hitting
at the top level of China oh that's
interesting all right so let me take
some more callers Thanks James
appreciate it appreciate it
so that's an interesting point if China
is losing
if China is losing population as well
that would suggest they are not the the
top of the control
because they wouldn't be doing it to
themselves they'd be doing it to other
people
all right
see if we get somebody else here so we
got uh what kinds of the theories
notice it's mostly men
what's up with that
women are women are bowing out here
all right let's talk to Owen
Owen are you there
hello Owen
good how are you
I'm doing great so what what a weigh in
on this is there a global Elite and are
there demons or no demons
well I I my main argument is I think I'm
aligned with you that most of what we
see are people that are just acting out
of selfish interests but my argument
would be that's a distinction without a
difference
that I think the you know the people
that have a lot of money tend to also
accumulate a lot of power and so that
selfishness which I would be I would be
arguing is evil
um because I don't think they care about
especially ordinary people and their
interests that they're looking out for
their own interests and I do think they
coordinate with each other because they
make deals all the time they influence
media they influence government and they
push policies that are better for
themselves and not better for other
people and so like like always though
right I mean it's the same as always
now is that we are moving in my opinion
towards a more network based system
um so I think to some extent that's
causing
but he leads to have less control
frankly than they used to have or at
least it's harder for them to maintain
that control but I think they're still
taking actions to try and reassert and
keep that control and but I guess you
know
do you see any Central coordination at
all do you think that the world economic
Forum or Bilderberg or anything do you
think that any combination or one of
them is in charge
I don't think I would believe that one
of them is in charge but I would say
that Farms like the Wes and The Who
and even the UN their whole purpose is
to help with that sort of coordination
you know they don't really listen to
just ordinary people and take regular
people's opinions into account they they
invite only these Elite people to their
forums and the whole purpose is to
facilitate that communication and the
relationships between those people right
which is business as usual right every
industry has the industry heads mate
every government's get together across
the world Governors and the states get
together so isn't it the most normal
thing in the world that people who have
something in something in common such as
the biggest CEOs would have meetings to
share information and network and stuff
like that isn't that the most normal
thing in the world
I mean I think
I think seen in recent decades is that
it has become much more globalized which
I think many people from the United
States for example would think is
against our interests because many jobs
have been lost over the years and you
know we saw what happened to the Rust
Belt where a lot of the jobs went
overseas the I.T Outsourcing other types
of Outsourcing where the people that run
these Mega corporations have said well
we don't care about what happens to the
workers or the people in our own country
we just care about our profits and so
we're gonna well use slave labor cheap
labor in places like China or other
places and but our bottom line
let's hear about the other effects
that's just capitalism
I suppose you could describe it as
capitalism but not what I would think is
you know an enlightened capitalism
because I think well there's no there is
no enlightened capitalism that that
doesn't exist
you know I I
I think the question though is does this
group exist I think it is a normal thing
I think it is something that probably
has existed forever I don't think it's a
new phenomenon I think we might be
noticing it a lot more right now that
there's a lot more ways for us to
communicate and get information than we
used to have yeah but do you think that
the elites are competing with each other
or they're all coordinated
in some kind of a you know Monopoly way
both I mean I think everyone is
competing with each other to some extent
because everyone does care about their
own interests but I think they are also
cooperating and they are making deals
with other Elites to make things happen
that benefit both of them so so friends
necessarily benefit other people so for
example Bankers would make deals
that were good for banks in general but
not maybe maybe not good for the
customers
yes that's one example yeah to me that's
just capitalism
and then the then the customers say hey
I'll go to another bank if you guys do
this all right let's thanks for the uh
input Owen I'm going to see if I can
move on get some more thoughts here
okay thank you
all right I was asked to uh let's talk
about 15-minute cities somebody want to
tell me how 15-minute cities are going
to end us all
you don't have to but let's let's talk
to Amy
Amy ask Amy you were on live
are you there
I don't think 15-minute cities are going
to end us all I live in a 15-minute area
myself where I can literally do anything
I needed to do on foot and have been for
the last 30 years oh hold up hold on
hold on 15 minutes radius hold on you're
already in you already live somewhere
where everything is convenient within 15
minutes but how how long have you been a
communist
well uh let's see
and how long is this last five seconds
since you called me
are there any Devils or demons in your
city or or they just put you there and
then then they go away
well you know what
we're signed out on the interstate that
said that if you lived here you'd be
home by now right and that spoke to me
so yes I live 10 minutes from downtown
but far enough away that it's not
a problem now dude and I I can walk to
the to three different grocery stores if
I needed but I will get in my instead
now oh so that sounds like a pretty good
deal I I used to live where I could walk
to buy my groceries it was the greatest
thing uh
you do although we did talk about it
yesterday have you seen my muscles I
have gigantic muscles I have seen
you on
it definitely gotten better I'm just
saying that out loud as a person who is
older than you well I appreciate that
thank you now what do you think what do
you think of a digital currency if all
your money is digital is that are you
afraid I'm not having a big one on
digital currency because it's just it's
floating out there
out there kind of like
six dollars and savings right now per
month which is kind of ridiculous to
Park money like that but when you get to
be a certain age you need to have
liquidity
I'm just I'm just not sure that
to the the proper channels but once you
go outside those channels like Bitcoin
you know I have a I have an awe of
Bitcoin but I'm not willing to go out
there and and put everything I've got in
Bitcoin because it's unknowable at this
point all right well thanks Amy I'm
going to take another caller thanks for
calling okay
all right
who wants to tell me that uh 15 million
cities are bad
which I Cheryl
Cheryl are you there
Cheryl
Cheryl will be here any minute as soon
as she unmute her microphone hey Cheryl
big in general FaceTime all right
everything you're talking about to me
please do um and and believe me I pay
attention I'm not saying people don't
but but some people just don't they
don't they don't see the connections and
w-e-f-e-u
um The Who
they're all in the same boat so you know
you talk about let's you were just
talking about 15-minute cities that's
our that's all part of their agenda and
a lot and to me most of it has to do
with control so they make it you know
certainly in my County I'm probably in
the
bluest County in the country we were the
last
um unlock down and we we have the most
insane
um County leaders and leaders in my
state I'm in Maryland and
um so we are Sanctuary city
um and they've been pushing so they're
not going to come right out and say
you're not going to be able to have own
cars you're going to have to live in
um 400 square foot Apartments
hold on hold on they're literally taking
away our choices you think that their
idea is to give you fewer choices not
more choices
absolutely because absolutely 100
control so they're basically they've
been hold on let me let me hold on hold
on let me ask you some questions about
this control thing
everybody who has power wants control
because if they don't have control
that everything falls apart so so
everybody everybody in power wants
control Facebook wants to control their
customers control the government the
government wants the controls so when
when I hear that somebody wants to
control something I hear
I hear nothing
so that's like people people like to
Facebook
to my argument we can I can choose not
when you hook up
you have to live in a an apartment
um right okay but hold on
a car right and then I take I have a
problem who do you think is telling you
that that's going to happen so nobody
said that you just assumed because they
do it slowly this is what this is why
our country's screwed right now we're
doing it slowly
implementing these things these things
step by step who's who's they and what
is their purpose oh they is
um the elites all of them so all the
bankers all so is is Elon Musk working
with
all with Bill Gates
what is Bill Gates is Bill Gates working
with Elon then they're probably not
alone is Elon working with Bill Gates
are they in the same team
I don't know I think I'm you know what I
I actually do support Elon I think that
he's actually a doer and he's been
um he's been you know telling us what
he's going to do and he's been doing it
um have you ever noticed yeah
have you ever noticed that there are no
billionaires who say what you say
that there there's yeah I have of all
the billions they don't want more people
to be in the club hold on hold on you
you think all all the billionaires are
in the same Club
all the same Club I did not say that
okay
all right if they're not in the same
Club
if they're not in the same Club isn't it
surprising that there's not one
billionaire who's spoken up against them
well you know what look what happens to
people when they speak up against them I
mean right now they sort of have a huge
power force
um
and so I you know look at people that
have have spoken up again against them
look at people you know me for example
who's spoken out against them I mean
thank God nothing bad has happened
haven't lost my job or anything but I
know people that have so so you think
that Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates uh do
they do they do they agree on everything
they do absolutely absolutely they are
all
but I'm telling you right now and this
is just my opinion people can a lot of
people can make conspiracy theorists you
can right but you learn condescending
voice but I don't care but Elon but Elon
elon's not in the club or he is in the
club
I don't believe Elon is in the club I
believe Elon has has a greater good for
Humanity uh mindset do you think maybe
that's altruistic on my part but that's
just what I'm seeing do you think do you
think the richest man in the world is
aware of this club absolutely good I
think that there are people that are
very aware then why did you say it
doesn't exist whatever they can why does
he say it doesn't exist maybe not out in
the open what dismantle this club why
does why does Elon just say that Waf is
just a club for rich people it's
basically nothing
I don't think he wants to I think again
um he's not gonna you know I've asked
him and I asked um no I'm not gonna let
her speak no no I'm looking at the
comments no I'm absolutely not going to
let her speak because she's she's a
she's just going on
absolutely not I'm gonna turn her off
because of all the comments here
right I'm not I'm not turning her off
because of her comments I'm turning off
because of your comments
right stop telling me not to interrupt
her
if she's going on and she's made her
point and she won't listen to questions
then I don't want to have her on here
you've got to be able to understand how
a conversation Works to do this your
your minimum requirement for being a
good guest on Spaces is that you let the
other person break in so that you don't
go too far without being questioned on
the point you're making if you're under
your fifth point and you haven't let me
break in you can't be a guest you you
have to go away right make a point let
me challenge it make your point let me
challenge it that would be a
conversation but no I'm not going to let
her speak
don't don't ask me to do that that's a
ridiculous request
so let's try it again
without all that
oh here's uh BJ
let's add BJ
BJ are there
can you hear me
hey Scott how you doing brother I'm good
how are you
uh I'm very good
um give me your take on all this stuff
okay so in general
um and just a little bit of context I've
run politically in Canada on the federal
level
I know many of our members of parliament
have a very uh more than superficial
understanding of how it works behind the
scenes and in front of the scenes it's
um
it's way more complex
than just saying there's one group of
they
because there's so many different
competing interests
and they're all stabbing each other
they're all stabbing each other in the
back that's the way a political party
works right that's what that's the way I
understand it as a bunch of competing
Elites go ahead
yeah there's a lot of people I mean this
is the whole what I talk about
politically the political establishment
and the lobby class
they go directionally in the same
direction just because they share
similar interests
but they're also trying to stab each
other in the back
and I think that's also why it's very
difficult for them to succeed with these
narratives and that people are aware
that something is going on behind the
scenes but it's not like there's one guy
at the top who makes all the decisions
and has you know an army of soldiers who
execute his plan none of the army of
soldiers are always trying to cut them
off at the neck as well
so it's it's it's more complex than just
one basic way does that make sense yeah
I think I'm on exactly the same page
which is uh the the outcome of all of
people's selfish actions
make it look like it's coordinated
but but that's just a coincidence in
other words it's just a faulty pattern
recognition
yeah I think that's
[Music]
that's fine uh I mean I know some of
those people and they're not one group
many of them hate each other the example
I give to people often is are you
telling me that Bill Gates and Elon Musk
are on the same page exactly no
but at the same time I know some of
these people look at somebody like Klaus
Schwab
and they think he's a clown
but he somehow puts together this uh
conference every year and sometimes
there's somebody else within the
billionaire class who has a company that
they want to do business with
so they're going to go to to klaus's
stupid clown show
ignore a Klaus but maybe they'll make a
contact that they agree with because
they want to expand their business that
doesn't mean I like Klaus and I don't
think Klaus has some you know maybe
negative impacts on politics but also
doesn't mean that it's so simplistic
that it's this binary good versus bad
black versus white sort of thing yeah I
will tell you that I know quite a few
billionaires but I've never met a
billionaire who believed that there was
a they controlling the world
well that was that wouldn't be them but
you know I know enough of them
personally that if if there was somebody
else including them
you know controlling the world I'd know
about it
yeah and all
day billionaire class
give to the world through philanthropy
and through projects and through
Charities that's something where I don't
know why we've been trained out of this
but some of the people I know the amount
of money they give for causes genuinely
generally because they just want to help
and they see that life is a struggle for
a lot of people right that's the people
we've been primed to think oh it's the
US versus them oppressor versus
oppressed one percent versus 99 that's
just not how the world works at least
from my perspective what I've seen
politically behind the scenes and you
know as somebody who's been in the
Forefront of a few things including that
Convoy but the last thing I'll tell you
is on the topic of they with the freedom
Convoy with the trucking Convoy the
trucking Convoy was sabotaged and it was
sabotaged by a group of what we call
they of the political class not
necessarily because they're evil but
because they want to maintain political
control over certain voting blocks but
that's about as far as it goes that's
about as much power as they have and
they struggle
to maintain that control just because
there's loud mouths like myself and
other people who you know that don't
allow them to engage with it and a
billion learned most of them hate
politics they get involved because it's
a necessary evil for their business I
don't know if you found the same yeah
totally yeah nobody likes politics if
they also have money you can't you can't
like both of those things all right
thanks BJ appreciate the comments
take care
thank you
all right if you didn't recognize them
that's BJ from
the Canadian Freedom truckers Freedom
Convoy whatever it's called
all right um I think I think I've said
enough
um I'm gonna close out the uh
the spaces and thanks for joining and
I'll say goodbye now
all right the spaces is closed and I'm
back now part of the problem part of the
problem you can see is that
um
there are different opinions here so
it's hard to get any one take
but
I I would say I would divide it into
basically
two to three different categories of
thought
what is the Demonic evil concept that
there's a real thing called evil and
it's infected the elites and they're
trying to destroy the world
the the other is that it's just rich
people who want control there's no
Devils or evils just a bunch of
um just a bunch of selfish people trying
to get what they want and that model of
course they want control
because everybody wants control
but not necessarily trying to destroy
the world they're just trying to have
more control I suppose and then there's
my opinion
which you heard a few people have
something something similar which is
there's just a whole bunch of rich
people looking out for themselves and
their stockholders which is a way to
look out for themselves as well and the
end result of that because capitalism
and free markets are not perfect
is a whole bunch of problems
and we can see the problems and they
look so pervasive
especially the popular the population
decline it looks so pervasive it almost
looks organized
but in my opinion it's not organized in
the least
there are however certain things such as
climate change the sincere people think
is their biggest thing and they're
coordinating on it so there's certainly
lots of at least coordinating
but they do have somewhat transparently
most of the coordination is right in
front of you you know even the 15-minute
cities and you know you'll owe nothing
and be happy they put out the video
and they're actually floating these
ideas right in front of you I'm not I'm
never afraid of transparency
if these big scary organizations are
putting on a video telling you exactly
what they think a good future would look
like
that's the opposite of scary
that's
that's free speech that's floating some
ideas that's brainstorming
I don't have any problem with it at all
now
if they're trying to do it just for a
control you have to take it to the next
level
okay and that's that's the part that's
missing nobody wants control for the
sake of control
would you agree
control is not an end product you want
control to make money you want control
to protect your family you want control
uh maybe because it feels good you know
there's a bunch of reasons but it's not
the control you want you want to feel
good make money be healthy be powerful
something
control is not its own end
um
control is a means to an end that is
correct
and I don't see I don't see anybody
who's got a lot of money who wants to do
anything that reduces the free market
so the idea that the 15-minute c will be
a way to take your car away
to me that doesn't ring true at all
if you told me that there would be
15-minute cities where cars are not
allowed I would say oh that's almost
guaranteed
but do you think that they won't let you
live in the other cities
if you want a car
do you really think they're just going
to say it's all 15-minute cities that's
everything in the United States will
turn into a 15 minute no it will just be
a very small alternative
you know one percent of the population
will willingly not want to have a car I
might be one of them
and they'll go to a 15-minute City if
they feel like it then there'll be a
different 15-minute sitting that's you
know a whole you know different set of
ideas than the other one and some people
will like that one and then the best
parts of these little cities will turn
into the new cities and it's called the
free market
but I don't think you're going to be
forced to do anything
with one exception you will be forced to
have digital currency eventually you
will have digital money and you will not
have cash someday
but you all know that
that's not me saying I want it
there just isn't any way that you will
always be able to use a piece of paper
in your pocket to pay for stuff it's
just definitely going away I just don't
know when 10 years or 50. well it's
definitely going away
social credit is inevitable but it also
exists
you think you don't have a social credit
score
who thinks they don't have a social
credit score
of course you do
yeah of course you do
you totally do you're so your financial
life has a credit score
if you have any kind of a business that
can get a Yelp review You've Got A Yelp
review
right if you were a employee you got an
annual review
if you did something on social media it
lives there forever and they check it
right how much closer could you get to
um
how much closer could you get having a
credit and score and we basically have
one
you know you wouldn't even know the
difference
would you
and the government already knows if you
have let's say a if you have a criminal
record you don't get to hide it
so they know your credit your criminal
record
they know your social media history
they know your job performance because
you could call the other employer and
get a recommendation
I mean yes
I yeah military service exactly right so
I completely agree with you
that a social credit score would be a
negative
but we basically have one
and the same with they can turn off your
digital money
they could do that now
they can turn off your ATM tomorrow
all that all they need is a reason the
only thing the government needs to turn
off all of your money
is a reason
and that would be the same as whether it
was digital currency or anything else
if they had a reason they turn it off
exactly the same as now
no difference
try turning off Bitcoin
I'll bet they can turn off Bitcoin
um
don't be bad at me for being right
some people are mad at me for being
right
that feels unfair
resistance is futile
well I don't know if resistance is
futile
maybe you can put it off a little longer
but it doesn't rise to the level of
anything I'm caring about right now
uh
having some lack of Freedom doesn't mean
we ought to accept more control did I
tell you you should accept more control
no no I think control is sort of a
pendulum
do you remember when the the pandemic
was in full swing and the government was
trying to exert ridiculous levels of
control which they did
and then it was over and then we turned
those controls off
I think that's the way things work you
get more control people complain they
lose them
just forever
ESG is uh is the free market yes she is
the free market because there's
literally a you know Vivek ramaswamy as
a fund of non-esg companies so it's very
much the free market it's just that at
the moment
it's winning in the free market but do
you think ESG is going to be a big thing
in 10 years
you think you think that's still going
to be the thing it's probably not a
chance
but probably everything like that
reverses every decade or so
all right I think I've jabbered enough
made you mad enough at me
who's mad at me
let's find out how many of you are mad
at me right now
anybody get mad
I did get a little snippy there at one
point
just you just met in general
all right
you're disappointed oh
oh
somebody's disappointed in me
do you know what it means to be a man in
the United States maybe in the world but
in the United States do you know what
the the primary
um
let's say the primary operating system
or mental state of a man
is you're disappointed in me
yep yeah if you're in a relationship
somebody's disappointed with you every
day
if you do any kind of the public thing
people are disappointed if you have a
job people are disappointed
yep you're all disappointed in me
it's all terrible
all right that's all for now YouTube
thanks for joining
and I'll talk to you tomorrow
