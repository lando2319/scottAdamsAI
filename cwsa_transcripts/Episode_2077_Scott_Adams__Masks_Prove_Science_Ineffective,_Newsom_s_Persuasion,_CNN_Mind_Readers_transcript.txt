Papa
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I don't
think there's ever been a finer time in
your life or in the history of
the entire universe but if you'd like to
take it up a notch and I know you can
all you need is uh
copper mug or a glass a tanker cellist
iron a canteen Joker flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
the end of the day the thing that makes
everything better
whether you're in Pleasanton today or
not
it's called the simultaneous system that
happens now
go
oh Joe says real adults don't play
sipping games
who hurt you Joe
was there something in your past
that hurt you
well let's talk about all the news
which is delightful and entertaining
today
uh number one you all know uh
left-leaning jenk uyghur Jank Eiger
whose name I can never pronounce but I
could spell it
c-e-n-k
you all know who he is right
he tweeted this today and I'm going to
give him credit for this I have to admit
jenk
even though he's solidly you know on a
team he does occasionally
see the whole field and let you know
that he can see it
so I do have respect for his opinion
because I don't respect anybody who
can't see the other side's point of view
he can see it
but sometimes prefers you know the other
point of view that I respect but if you
can't even explain the other side then I
don't have much respect for your opinion
you have to at least understand the
other point
so here's Jank tweeting this he says
there's a zero percent chance I would
vote Trump
but look at how the right wing accepts
people who agree with them
five percent
whereas left wing tries to banish anyone
who disagrees with them 0.05 percent
but that's not the real left it's a
bunch of posers pretending to represent
the left
now he sees it right
now I would say that is a perfect
explanation of my audience
because I don't think anybody disagrees
with their own audience more than I do
do you think that I could have a
left-wing audience and disagree with
them as much as I do with this crowd
impossible
this is mostly people who say well I
disagree with that but I like hearing
that point of view as long as it's you
know well presented
and then I can you know test against my
current opinion or maybe change it
but I don't see that on the left
but to jenk's point I'm going to meet
him in the middle
which is that I don't think as as he
says
the ordinary Democrats are not that the
ordinary Democrats are also accepting of
people being different
it's just the the weird control group of
the left that's ruining everything
there'll be a lot more on that point as
we work through the headlines it turns
out there's a theme
don't you love it when I have a theme
yes the theme is brainwashing
and
and the the history of it and why we're
in trouble now because we don't have
enough of it
that's the theme
the problem with the United States is
insufficient brainwashing
and I mean that
I mean that I'll prove it as we go along
all right so I would once again like to
use a Jenks tweet
as my uh cue to show some appreciation
for all of you because I know you
disagree with me a lot
and you're probably going to disagree
with me today on at least one topic
and you still come back
so that that's good on you that's a good
look
Rasmussen did a poll on religion and the
I guess I just want to check if this
matches your observation in in the
United States
75 of American adults say religious
faith is important to their daily lives
does that match your experience the 75
of the people that you deal with
feel their religion religious faith is
important not just in general not just
in general
but to their daily life
that tracks
I've seen a lot of yeses a lot of people
say yeah that looks Lucifer right on
YouTube there's more no's than the S's
so that's probably just a difference in
the audience
but there's a mix
I thought that was higher than I would
have expected I'm not saying it's wrong
I wouldn't have expected it to be that
high
um
44 of adults go to church or synagogue
or mosque at least once a month
does that sound right based on your
experience a little less than half
of the population goes to a church or
synagogue or mosque once a month
that feels like it could be right
I don't know I would guess a little bit
High
but I'll accept that that sounds about
right
and well that's all I had to say on that
apparently it's not that much changed
recently
all right how many of you saw on social
media
uh that there was a big old study that
looked at all the mask Effectiveness
studies and declared that masks don't
work how many saw that story
yes or no
did you see it
yes yes yes
let me see it all right
so here here's the part where you're not
going to like it
a lot of you didn't see that story and
social media
yeah it's all well there's quite a
difference between the locals
good all right so all of you who said
yes that you saw the story
are you ready for this
no you didn't that doesn't exist
it doesn't exist
do you think you saw a story that says
masks the studies the masks were looked
at and that have found that maths are
ineffective
do you think you saw that today right
does anybody still think is anybody
still going to say they saw that
that didn't happen
it's widely believed it happened it's
all over the Internet didn't happen
let me tell you what did happen
there was a study
in which masks prove that science isn't
effective
that's actually what happened there was
not a study where science proved masks
were ineffective that didn't happen but
that's why it's being reported
what did happen
is that people did things and they
showed that masks
proved science doesn't work
meaning that they don't know whether
masks make any difference or not because
the mask situation proved
science doesn't work
they didn't prove anything about masks
they only proved science itself doesn't
work here's what I mean by that
there were lots of studies
but none of them met the minimum
criteria for credibility
now
how many of you didn't know that
is there anybody who didn't already know
there's no such thing as a mask study
you should believe
do you know why I've known that for
three years
because on day one the people who know
what they're talking about said you
cannot do a proper study on masks and
Coronavirus because if you did it would
be unethical
it actually is logically
impossible if you also want to be
ethical and anybody who does a big study
is going to have to be there isn't any
way to study it it is an unstudyable by
its nature you cannot use science to
find out if masks work
it isn't a thing
here's why
you would have to expose people to
actual death or the risk of death
if you think if the experts say well we
think masks might work
they might
under that condition and that is what
the experts largely said well they
should or might or could or maybe in
some situations
under that situation you can't test it
so here's what they could test
they could test masks without
coronavirus they could test it on other
stuff
that doesn't tell you anything
does it
and here's the only thing I would have
wanted them to test but of course it
would be completely unethical
the only thing I would wanted them to
test is people in nursing homes
who have visitors that always wear masks
and keep their visits to let's say
five minutes
versus ones who kept it to five minutes
and didn't wear masks
and then you see how many old people die
and then you know what the difference is
if it's a really big test and you do
everything else right there's nothing
else that would be useful everything
else is just sort of well
it's in the general area of masks and
science but it doesn't really tell you
anything
so when you're watching the headlines
today and it's going to be all over the
news tonight
watch how many people report
something like science just proves that
masks don't work now to be clear
I I oppose masks because there is no
science that says they work
is that fair enough
does anybody have a problem with that
oh locals just crashed
God
amazing
um
sorry let me see if I can just close it
and reopen again
um I may have to abandon locals if I
can't get the live stream to to work I'm
not I'm not going to abandon the entire
use of it but I don't think live
streaming makes any sense anymore
let's see if I can fire this up
oh this is just this is beyond annoying
I can't even express how frustrating
that is
all right I think I'm just gonna have to
tell the locals people I can't use this
in the morning anymore
I guess this could be just YouTube or
Rumble Rumble doesn't do live stream
well let me take that back Rubble
doesn't do live stream in a in a way
that would be easy enough to use every
day
unless you have an engineer or something
videos up the chat was down yeah it
looks like it's all down now
let's try it one more time
maybe looking back who knows
but I doubt it all right well I'll just
let it run there oh God
I've never wanted to punch a computer
this bad like I just want to take that
iPad and just and just destroy it on the
floor except I know the iPad is working
fine
all right well moving on
um just watch how the news treats this
mask study they are not going to do what
I did which is tell you that science
doesn't work we don't know about masks
I'm opposed to them because they
definitely have a downside
but no
no verifiable upside
it looks like the street might be coming
back I can't tell
yeah let's see
we'll see what happens
all right um
Newsome has a new approach against
Republicans that's really strong and
it's so strong it makes me wonder if a
professional helped him
do you remember in 2016 when I called
out the word dark
and all the oh there we go locals is
back up
when Newsome we're talking about Newsome
if you're on locals you just if you just
joined us
um so Newsome is starting to call
Republicans and Bullies
and when I heard him use that I thought
to myself
oh no
that's professional grade
so here's what's not professional oh
those uh Republicans are all racists
right that's not really professional
work it's effective but that didn't come
from any kind of professional it's just
what everybody does
but when you hear somebody use a unique
word like uh Trump's speech is dark
you say dark
that's a general word that can suck up
anything that Trump does you can call
anything he does dark and then that's
good persuasion because it just absorbs
everything he does and puts it in the
same label dark it's dark we don't like
dark
well this bully thing does the same
thing
because you could apply it to a whole
bunch of different policies and go well
there they are again
look at those bullies
and Bullies Are something that we're
going to associate with our own
experience if you've been bullied
it's perfect
here's why you have to worry about
Newsom
that's not just good
in terms of persuasion that's not just
good
that's as good as you can get
and if you don't know the difference you
might find out when he's your president
because there's there's a lot of stuff
that you know Newsome bugs me a little
bit he's a little he projects an
arrogance
this just hard to get past and he seems
kind of artificial but I suppose all
politicians do but when you see them
pull out the bullies persuasion
I just said to myself uh oh he either
has somebody really powerful
you know some kind of wizard helping him
out
uh or he did that on his own which would
suggest he's got a lot of games but
that's not normal
right using the the bully framing
that's suggestive of a higher level of
uh persuasion skill so I'd watch out for
that that's a really good attack
all right uh
so apparently uh both uh who is it NPR
and PBS are both pulling back from
Twitter because they're labeled by musk
as government-backed media I guess
they've used different
different words to say that the
government funds them or the government
backs them or they're affiliated
uh and musk is just just continues dump
dunking on these people is so funny he
tweets NPR literally said on their
website on their website quote
Federal funding is essential to Public
Radio
and then they took it down
so their old website
agreed with my Musk that they are
government funded and that is essential
to their operation their own website
said that and then when musk essentially
agreed with what they say on their own
website
they said you damn liar and then they
went to the website and they took it now
now this is the group that you depend on
for your news
they couldn't even tell you the accurate
news of what their own website says
that really happened they could not even
give you an accurate description of the
headline of their own website
it's almost impossible to believe that
this is real
like this doesn't even sound like a
sitcom
it would be too absurd to be on TV as
like a joke
is that it's that far gone it's just
crazy at this point but but
watching uh Elon Musk continuously dunk
on the media and be right
is really fun to watch it's this best
show in town
all right so let's talk about Biden's
proposed mandate that two-thirds of all
the cars by 2030 have to be electric
cars or electric vehicles let's say
what do you think of that
what do you think of the government
telling you that two-thirds of the cars
have to be
uh Electric
it's nuts it's ridiculous
it's idiotic
it's also being forced by the government
right we don't like that
all right I'm gonna
I gotta go contrarian on this
and when I say contrarian I mean I'm
going to disagree with most of my
audience
and I'm going to give you the steel I'm
going to give you the steel man argument
right so I want you to hear the best
argument for Biden's point of view
I'm not sure if it's the argument he
would make
but if I were to defend Biden's uh
government overreach would you agree
it's sort of an overreach for the
government to put this much of a boot on
free markets feels like it right so so
let's agree it feels wrong
I think we could all agree on that it
feels wrong we don't like the government
imposing stuff on free market but would
you also agree that the government
routinely
imposes itself on the free market and
not always to bad effect
not always to bad effect let me give you
an example
uh when Kennedy said we're going to go
to the Moon
that created a bunch of your NASA and
government-funded activity but also a
lot of free market stuff that would
support the government's efforts so that
was the case of the government putting a
big boot on something but probably
produce the benefits
can you think of other situations in
which the government has put a big boot
on things yeah they worked out okay
welcome everyone
I've replaced most of my light bulbs
with LEDs
now in the beginning the first LEDs you
couldn't dim them
unless you put in a special
base to it so you couldn't dim them and
you also couldn't get different colors
so it'd be like this white color instead
of a nice warm orangey color that you
might prefer so when the government
forced everybody to get the LEDs
I would say for a long time it was
mostly bad because you couldn't get the
light bulbs you wanted the free market
was being interfered with the light
bulbs cost too much and then they
weren't as good
so the government made you spend more to
get something that was less good
well
as of today
you know years have gone by as of today
you can dim your you can dim your LEDs
and you can in fact I've got one red on
my desk I can change the color
so we got to the place we needed to get
and I think LEDs will be cheaper right
in the long run an LED would be cheaper
than regular incandescent bulb I would
think maybe not yet but in the long run
and then certainly with the usage so
there are a number of situations which I
think you could point to
in which the government created a bunch
of friction in the short run
but it did get us to a place faster than
maybe the free market would have gotten
uh there also yeah their battery
breakthroughs and their other
breakthroughs like that so here's what I
think about this I think that in general
you have to be cautious about the
government putting pressure on the free
market
so so this should be every red flag in
the world that goes off when that
happens and that part I agree with you
all the red flags are going hey get away
from our free markets but
that doesn't mean that every time they
do it it's going to fail
it just means you really got to watch
that stuff
um I actually think
that because there's a Strategic
Homeland Security element to this
because I see this more as Homeland
Security
so one of one of the things that I do
that's maybe less common in terms of
looking at politics is I don't separate
National Defense from economics
to me they're they're all the same
does the best economy almost always wins
the war
right Whoever has the most money
um so to me having having the strongest
defensive economy is just part of
Homeland Security
so a big part of the EV push is
connected with Biden also working on and
I don't think they do a good enough job
of selling this Biden could do a better
job of selling this because at the same
time they're forcing you to get electric
cars they're apparently putting a lot of
effort into bringing battery
manufacturing out of China and and
bringing it domestic now that alone
if the reason that you could bring
domestic manufacturing or batteries to
the United States is only because those
manufacturers will see that they're
going to be a lot of electric cars
right so the government can create the
market for the electric cars
which creates the economic conditions
where a free market will say oh we
should make these batteries in the
United States because people aren't
going to want to buy them in China and
maybe we could use robots to make them
just as cheaply in the United States
because you probably can't I would
imagine it's mostly robots and our
robots cost the same as China's robots
so in the long term
Biden may be goosing our battery
industry by artificially putting the you
know putting a big pressure on the car
manufacturing industry and we could
actually come out way ahead on this
so we could come out way ahead not only
in reduction of uh electricity
but this could be the thing that forces
uh nuclear power
because I was just reading a thread by
Alex Epstein now there are a number of
people I respect a lot who are going to
say this is a bad idea
I'm not going to ignore them
because they're incredible people who
are doing the math
but the part of the math that you can't
do is the future nobody can do math in
the future
you can do math of what it would cost
today and so here here's the the flags
that people are raising the warning
flags and Alex Epstein does this well
right now we don't have an electrical
grid
that can produce enough electricity for
massive electric cars
but I think
that that's what forces us to get one
I think what forces us to do nuclear
energy what forces us to fix our grid is
necessity
you just have too many cars and you just
won't be able to you won't be able to
heat your home or cook your food
unless you fix all that stuff which we
need to fix
so I'm not entirely sure this is a bad
idea
I think that it's unpredictable
and I think that nobody can do the
economics that far in the future to know
if the disruption in the present is
going to pay for itself in the future
that's unknowable
and I used to do that for a living right
it was my job
to predict the economics in the future
when I work for a bank and for the phone
company
and this is one that I can tell you for
sure there's nobody who can predict the
economics of this
so if you're automatically against it
because you can't see how
it makes sense for the environment yet
where you can't see how it makes any
difference with China yet in terms of
their control of our supply chain or you
can't see how we would produce enough
clean energy so it's actually cleaner
than burning coal to produce electricity
yet
uh it's a bold move
it's a bold move but if you see it in
terms of economics maybe it's a little
sketchy if you see it in terms of
Homeland Security as it is the the best
way to bring our supply chain home for
the most important stuff
batteries
um then it starts to make a lot more
sense
so that's what Biden is doing wrong he
needs to connect his battery
manufacturing part of his plans to his
EV plans and then it starts making sense
but as a national security question not
strictly economics
that was strictly
all right well I'll just put that out
there
and
um
let's see what else is going on
so
so you know as Trump is being
investigated for his documents
and I've been trying to reconcile the
following statements
statement number one Trump said he gave
the government back all their classified
documents that they asked for
but at the same time the government says
you did not give us all the
government-owned documents are those
opposites
okay Trump says I gave you all the
government-owned documents
the government says you did not give us
all the government-owned documents
is one of them live
is one of them lying
one says you did give us all the
government-owned documents the other
says
you didn't give us all those are
opposites right
so somebody's lying
those are opposites
not necessarily correct
not necessarily and here's how I predict
this is going to go
government says
we have proof you didn't give us the
documents owned by the government
Trump says
those were my documents
that's the case
government says but you didn't give us
all the government documents Trump says
I gave you all of your documents the
ones I kept were mine
that's what it's going to be and that is
going to be a difference of opinions
of whether the the actions that Trump
took could make them no longer
government classified
but maybe there's still government owned
but I'll bet you he's going to have an
argument
that he Declassified them
and that he owns them
I'll bet it'll make that argument and I
don't think that you can prove that he
meant otherwise
now the argument that I think you should
press harder I've always I've only heard
him say it once and he doesn't say this
directly as I do it would go like this a
president can declassify anything
and there's no rules for how he does it
or she
there are no rules it's just they have
the power so one way they could do it is
to say whenever I snap my fingers over a
document it is Declassified
and then that would be the rule
because the president gets to say how
it's done he could say whenever I
sprinkle salt on a document
it is now Declassified
and then that would actually be legal
because there's no there's no rule that
says he has to do it a certain way
the way he says he does it
is by taking the man of the secured
place
and I completely agree with that
argument
if the president takes something from a
secure place
to an unsecured place or less secure for
classified documents in my view whether
it was Biden or or Trump or anybody else
as long as there's no specific rule
telling them how to declassify that is
Declassified
in my opinion that argument is airtight
to me to me I don't see any way he could
lose the lose that case because you
can't give me 12 people who will
disagree with that point you can get
several but you're not going to get 12
jurors to say no I don't agree that if
there are no rules about how to do it
then simply moving it from secure to
unsecure is all you need to know there
there'll be a few jurors maybe most will
say yeah it's a it's an unspecified
process it would be pretty obvious that
he means them to be Declassified by his
actions
if that's his argument so
all right
um yeah I think that government owned is
going to be where everything falls apart
now Trump is complaining that this I
guess the guy who's looking into all
this stuff Jack Smith
apparently he and his family are big
anti-trumpers
how in the world do we allow somebody
who has a known history of being anti
the defendant
I'm too early to call him a defendant
but you know what I mean the the subject
of the investigation
agent Smith oh my God
it's agent Smith
from The Matrix
how in the world do we allow that
like that is so un-American
that we'd know the person who's
investigating hates the subject
that's just so wrong I'm sure it happens
all the time but when it comes to
politics if you know the person has a
problem with the subject
I mean Trump has a completely good point
here
um and then there's all this leaking
that seems to be coming out which is
purely
to damage Trump
and now there's new I guess there's some
some new lawsuits against Trump so
they're basically trying to bury him in
law fair which
I feel like there needs to be some kind
of legislation
that says if you get the nomination
that all your all your legal actions
have to be suspended until you're out of
office
now you might have to make an exception
if it's like a
felony
I don't know there would have to be some
exceptions but for the little stuff
I don't want to I don't want anybody to
take my candidate out of action by by a
whole bunch of BS lawsuits
yeah I I think that they should not be
charged while they're running for office
once they got the nomination or while
they're in office I think that should
just be you just gotta wait sorry gotta
wait four years or eight
yeah
um
so this abortion pillow situation that
one Court said you couldn't have the
pill and then another Court reversed the
reversal
so now you can have it but only under
certain restrictions so it's more
restricted than it would have been
um
I'll tell you I have respect for
Republicans for pushing as hard as they
do on abortion
because they believe it like it's a
genuine belief of what's good and bad
and it's
you know it's well intentioned
so I'm always I'm always impressed when
people are consistent and
well-intentioned and
you ever notice that people will say
they believe something but they don't
act like it well the Republicans really
act the way they talk
they're the Republicans are completely
throwing away their
best chance at Power
to keep abortion as illegal as possible
now I'm not saying I agree with their
stand because I stay out of abortion I I
prefer women to work it out keep the men
out of it as far as I'm concerned you
are the man who can do what you want
it's a free country
that's just my stand so I'm not making
argument for or against abortion in case
it sounds like that I'm I'm simply
complimenting Republicans
for taking a hard Choice which is really
giving up a lot in terms of political
power a lot
for that principle
and I respect that
it's just it's hard to see a principal
stand anymore and when you see one yeah
gotta respect it
all right
uh here's here's my theme I told you I
was going to get to about the
brainwashed generation
so probably most of you watching this
know
that back 70 years ago Alan Dulles and
the CIA launched a mind control program
on the population of the United States
it was called MK Ultra
and among other things they and there
were lots of components of it and it
it convinced movies and TV shows and
probably the news to cover the news in a
way that turned Americans into
productive good Americans
and made us you know hate the commies
and whatever else they wanted us to
think
now I grew up in that generation so I
was the MK Ultra
brainwashed generation and literally
brainwashed now you know that when you
do the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the
national anthem the purpose of that is
brainwashing
we just call it patriotism
but the whole point of it is to take
humans who would maybe be more tribal by
Nature
and give them a larger Collective
purpose called the United States
and then we we have this reason
to work together because we're part of
the United States it's the best
brainwashing you could ever do
completely useful positive you could do
it wrong I mean you could brainwash
people into becoming Nazis
but you can't not do it
you can't have a country where you're
not trying to shape the citizens into a
productive form you just can't run a
country that way
so in more modern years that MK Ultra
thing was disbanded
so here's what I think happened
when MK Ultra and the CIA were running
our brains they did a good job
meaning they taught people to be
patriotic everybody I know that I grew
up with was patriotic we were just
brainwashed in this very productive way
now it wasn't
let's say honest
because America has done a lot of crappy
things and so you know the the
brainwashing would de-emphasize that
because nobody wants you to hate your
country you're not going to join the
military or pay your taxes if you hate
your country
so even though it's dishonest and Evil
you know if you dig down one layer it's
pretty evil it's also necessary
there's just no way around it
so now what happens if you take away
that Central mind control
and let people's own minds make up their
minds or allow whatever you know
grifters or media competition makes up
our minds
so
the predictable result is that we've
become more tribal
we call it identity
but it's just tribal it's people saying
I'm a certain kind of person I must
fight for the rights for the people who
are like my certain kind of person
that's the opposite of MK Ultra
MK Ultra would have said you're an
American you have you have equal
opportunities go make something of
yourself
right so
our entire operating system for the
United States which was unethical which
is we were all being brainwashed and
lied to
but it worked it worked really well now
we have a system which is everybody gets
to make up their own mind and we're
looking at grifters and fake news and
we're getting all worked out by social
media so that's what we replaced it with
chaos
and the chaos is doing exactly what
you'd expect it's making us more tribal
like where you're looking at yourself
now as your your race or your religion
or your your gender or preference
way more than you used to
um so that's where we're going let me
give you some
examples of things
so this all fit under this uh this
umbrella so I saw a David boxinghorn
tweet which I'll read to you he says
Republicans are stupid for letting
Democrats paint their anti-crime
anti-illegal immigration and pro-school
choice policies as anti-minority
minorities are the primary beneficiaries
of these policies
uh can we get Republicans to change the
messaging to appeal to minorities
now I can see the problem here
which is the Republican approach is to
not say we're doing something special
for any group
is that sort of opposite of being a
republican rather you might say we're
doing things for poor people
but it's because they're poor not
because of the race or anything else
so
there's a little bit of a republican
problem in messaging
even though I think the point is true
but I think there's a way to do it
I think that there is a way for the
Republicans to say look we're the ones
who are helping you if you're poor if
you're black if you're a minority all of
our all of our things help you
the Democrats things will not help you
because I think it's pretty easy to sell
people on the idea that Law and Order
is good for everybody
Pandora papers never heard of Mike Gill
or the Pandora papers
somebody's yelling at me in all caps
that there's some important story I've
missed never heard of them
so it's not in the regular news so I
don't know what you're talking about
so
um
all right
so I agree with that the Republicans are
doing more than they're saying they're
doing in other words they're they're
proposing better benefits for minorities
than minorities are aware of and they
should make a better case for that
uh I think they should
all right
here's uh Stefan Collinson on CNN he's
one of their opinion people who like to
they like to trot them out a few times a
week to say bad things about Trump
um
and
Collinson is going through all of the
Trump's mounting legal problems
even though in my opinion none of them
are anything but trivial or stupid but
there are a lot of them can't argue with
that
and here's how collinson's Collinson
wrote about
this he said yet another investigation
this one in Georgia over over Trump's
attempt to find just enough voters to
try to steal President Joe Biden's
victory in the swing state
what
this is an opinion piece it's not a
mind-reading piece you would literally
have to know what the what the
president's uh inner thoughts were to
say this as a fact
well I've not even seen evidence that
Trump believed he was stealing an
election what evidences are of that
there's no evidence of that
there's plenty of evidence that he
genuinely believed the election was
rigged plenty of evidence that
am I right
with all of the investigations has there
been one shred of evidence that Trump
believed the election was fair and he
was trying to steal it
all of these conversations you know all
of the investigation not a shred
not a shred and with no sense of
embarrassment whatsoever
Collinson puts this on a new site it's
you know it's an opinion but it's on a
new site
that that he was trying to steal victory
that is absolutely not in evidence
it's not impossible
but it's the least likely explanation
and it's not in evidence in any way not
in any way
so it's amazing so I would say that CNN
has failed in their quest to be
on you know balanced I mean this is a
pretty bad failure in my mind
so he's got some mind reading going on
there
all right
um this story from the New York Post
that America isn't nearly as racist as
we thought so there was a Florida State
professor
who is Black who for years has been
faking racism studies to show that
racism was worse than it is
and now it's known that they're fake
and he actually made up the data
when I say made up he left out data that
was not going to make his case he left
it out
so how many other studies on racism are
also fake
most
most probably most because everybody who
does a study is motivated
there's nobody who does a study on race
who doesn't have an opinion of what they
want it to be
right they're all trying to show
something don't you think that they can
find data to prove anything they want
of course they can just like masks you
can find any data you want on race
it's either getting way worse or way
better and you can prove it either way
so
and then here's a related story and I'm
going to tie these all together so the
Wall Street Journal has an editorial by
a gentleman
who says it might be partly his own
fault that corporations are acting so
woke
now this is interesting
so this is from
Gregory T Angelo and I guess he was a
big advocate for gay rights and so years
ago when gay rights were much less than
they are now
he was part of a group of people who
were pressuring corporations to take a
public stand where normally they would
not
and he succeeded he got corporations to
you know try to speak out and influence
the government and to become more you
know friendly to gay marriage and Etc
and and he's saying that it basically
now that went too far so he's also
saying it probably didn't make a
difference it
you say that the The public's opinion
about gay marriage and stuff probably
would have gone the way it went anyway
so the corporations probably didn't make
anything happen faster that wasn't going
to happen anyway
but now corporations routinely get
involved because other Advocates can
force them the same way that the gay
Advocates did
so he's saying that you know now now
there's just too much wokeism because
everybody found that same trick
he had their bullies
now it's easy to get the corporations to
get on board because you just have to
say if you do these things we'll say
good things about you if you don't do
these things we'll malign you in public
well it's kind of an Easy Choice do
whatever doesn't get you attacked
so
and then here's the story about that the
AP has about me if you Google my name
Google will surface as its top stories
where it summarizes stories it will
summarize the controversy about me
and then one of the top links that
Google has chosen you should see is
credited to the AP and this is what it
says about me
many comic creators said they'd stopped
reading Dilbert over the past several
years finding the strips tone darker and
his creators dissent into misogyny
anti-immigration and racism alarming
none of that happened in the real world
nothing even remotely like that happened
there's nothing about Dilbert or me
being misogynist I'm not even accused of
it
there's not even like there's not even a
fake accusation there's nothing
how about anti-immigration
that's one of the things my audience
doesn't like is that I'm so
pro-immigration I do think we should
have complete ability to close the
border
that will be stupid not to that's not
anti-immigration that's Pro controlling
your country
but this this exists on Google like it's
a fact
anybody who reads that is going to think
that really happened
that that comic creators
stopped reading Dilbert
because of his dissent
into the strips darker tones this strip
didn't have any darker tones that never
happened
Dilbert was completely non-political
completely
it never had any darker tones at all
and and this lives on Google
credited to the AP
as a fact
amazing amazing now let me pull it all
together
so you see the AP and Google you know
boldly putting fake news about me you
see that the corporations being pushed
to be more woke
you see fake stories about racism that
become part of our texture of what we
think is true
and
you see CNN can still just lie that they
can read the mind of a president
so
when MK Ultra stopped and tribalism went
crazy at the same time as you know
clicking a story became the way you
could track its popularity all of these
forces
created everybody to be at everybody's
else's next everybody just joined the
team and started fighting
so I I hate to say it but what the
country needs is a lot more brainwashing
I hate to say it because brainwashing is
evil it's immoral
it's unethical
and it's certainly not the freedom that
you would want
but complete chaos has got a cost
it's got a pretty now you're asking if
it stopped and I would say it did stop
in the sense of patriotism
there's definitely no MK Ultra going on
to make you more patriotic
I'm sure that's not happening there may
be other influences you know to let's
say
to make Ukraine a popular war
have you ever wondered about that
do you think that the citizens of the
United States
independently consume the news and then
decided that supporting Ukraine was in
their best interest
no no whatever happened there was
brainwashing but we don't know you know
who did it or exactly how but you are
brainwashed about Ukraine make no
mistake about that maybe not you
personally but the country is completely
brainwashed now is that bad I'm not
saying it's bad
this is where I'm being a little
provocative
brainwashing is a necessity
because the alternative is worse it's
just not a it's just not ethical
it's in it's not ethical
and also completely necessary
it's a bad situation to be in but it's
the only one we have
so yes the news is completely
non-credible and fake everything you
think you know is garbage
and
here we are
so this is why I keep saying that the
importance of
uh what I call the internet dads
is such a big deal
the fact that Elon Musk is calling out
the fake news
for being fake is really useful
because of his position and he's
credible
and I think that when I do it it's
useful I think that when anybody else
you know cernovich anybody else does it
is useful
so keep trying to be useful all right I
ran into a nest of NPCs and I had to
back out and cancel my tweet because the
NPC action was too big
and I'm gonna see how many NPCs I can
Surface
with the same trick would you like to
watch this experiment
I'm going to read you a story
and then we're going to watch the NPC
comments come in here's the story
the government has figured out how to
not every time but certainly they can do
it penetrate the uh privacy of Bitcoin
so that they can find out who spent
Bitcoin on what illegal things so now if
you think you can use Bitcoin to get
away with the crime
the government has tools which they've
been developing over time where they can
somewhat reliably
catch you
now NPCs please do your thing
go ahead
that's not news Peter thank you
first one
uh can't you already do that on the
blockchain that's not quite NPC but
that's where I'm heading
um
same with money okay
granted
it's called The Ledger boom we got it
first NPC it's called The Ledger
may I do my NPC impersonation
I'm going to ask Dale to come in and do
this
I I removed the Tweet so that people
would stop explaining this to me
Scott
uh did you not know that the entire
point of the blockchain is that it's a
public record that's permanent of where
every penny went
Scott did you not know that how do you
not know that it's a public Ledger it's
a public Ledger public
everybody can see it
well Dale I know that and therefore by
its nature
it never really could be completely
private
so that's so obvious that I don't think
it needs to be stated
that if it's a public Ledger even though
you know the keys are secret or whatever
clearly the government will figure out a
way to penetrate it and if they can't do
that they can put you in jail until you
tell them your keys
your passwords
so no
there is no way that I ever believe that
Bitcoin
could be plot private in the long run
Dale
so no when I say that the government has
tools I'm really trying to tell other
people
what I've known since the first day I
heard about Bitcoin which is if the
Ledger is public clearly there's some
way to penetrate it
there's gonna be a way
maybe not on day one but there's
definitely going to be way no it's not
private
in fact I believe there's no such thing
as any privacy
at all
there's none I've got devices listening
to me potentially the government can
look at all my records if they're
interested they just have to be
interested right
so Dale I have always understood that a
public Ledger could never be safely
private
but what I don't think you understand is
that from the very beginning The Ledger
has been public
foreign
so that's what I was dealing with this
morning the number of NPCs explaining to
me that something in public can never be
private
didn't really need to hear that did not
need to know that
all right so don't do your crimes on
bitcoin I guess that's what we need to
know
um
can it be penetrated by the BBC
excellent question
Eric you have your wish I am paying
attention to you right now
what were you trying to say what
uh
am I familiar with
all the all the crazy people always use
caps it's always so funny that they so
hot pocket says in all caps are you
familiar with Colonel L Fletcher Prouty
no
moving on
the the number of times that somebody
shouts at me in caps
to ask me if I know about some obscure
individual it's like always caps
have you heard of John K Smith
uh
all right
should Biden be telling kids that Jesse
Helms is the key to success
I don't think he is
uh
why do so many old people think that
Elon Musk is so cool and smart
huh
I wonder
has he ever done anything cool or smart
huh
[Laughter]
he only does something cool and smart
every day
there's nobody who's done more cool or
smart things either category nobody's
done more cool things and nobody's done
more smarter things but definitely
nobody's done more cool smart things
every day than that one person
all right
um I'm just gonna ignore all your caps
all right here's the new rule everything
in all caps gets ignored from now on got
that
every everything in all caps gets
ignored so I won't I won't read any
comments even if they're super chats
well that Lit Up locals
all right
what's that say
uh oh somebody lost all respect for me
uh
yours MK Ultra joke calling it not
regular news all right so that's just
crazy talk and dismissing the Pandora
papers and Mike Gill the biggest story
of our lifetime
I didn't dismiss it I said I never heard
of them
that's the biggest story of our lifetime
all right I'm going to read this comment
in all caps
you're the best sexiest cartoonist ever
all right but that's just the only
exception
that's the only exception
compliments and capsules
stop at stop at it's funny I get it
it's the Panama papers
all right well I'm pretty sure that uh
the Panama papers I've heard of
you're not the most based Boomer that I
know of well you take that back
can you believe it somebody is accusing
me of not being the most based Boomer
