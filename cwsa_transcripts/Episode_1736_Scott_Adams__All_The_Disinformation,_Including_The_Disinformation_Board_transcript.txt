morning everybody
wow don't you look good today
did you
do something like work out or start
eating right amazing
well i do talk to a lot of people who
tell me their life has been
benefited by
this live stream i hope you're one of
them
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
and wouldn't you wouldn't you yeah you
would
all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker tell
us this time you can't teach a plastic
vessel of any kind
wow
i'm seeing messages of people losing a
lot of weight
good for you
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that's the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
everything
and
it's called the simultaneous zip it
happens now go
that's so good
well i've added some members to my
personal disinformation board
i told you yesterday
that i've created my own disinformation
board these are the people you should
look to
to find out what's true and what isn't
now importantly in order to be a member
of my disinformation board you don't
have to apply
and you can't turn it down
because you're on the board if i say
you're on the board and that's the end
of the story
so the people i put on the board are not
the people i agree with
that's not the point so you're going to
see some people on this that you'll say
what
why is that person on the disinformation
board when i don't agree with anything
they ever say
and the answer is
this
there are people who can violate the
narrative
and to have a track record of doing
so i'm going to give you my list of
people who are already on there and i'll
tell you who i added today based on user
comments and just thinking about it more
so glenn greenwald jeff pilkington bill
maher andre shrugged
anatoly lebarsky
um
mike cernovich matt tybee tulsi gabbard
elon omar
we'll talk about that one
uh alan dershowitz michael
schellenberger and the ones i added
today were ian bremmer brett weinstein
eric weinstein
dave rubin
and dr drew
dr drew
i meant to have on the original list i
just
forgot a name
so correcting the list as we go
and
uh i think this is a pretty strong list
because everybody on this list has a
very clear
uh background of violating their own
narrative meaning the narrative on their
team
so let's talk about elon omar
um glenn greenwald is the first one that
pointed this out to me i wasn't aware of
this
but on several notable occasions she is
she's gone against the democrat
narrative
i think free speech was one of them
and
while there are plenty of things she's
going to say that i don't agree with
she's one of the people you want to look
to
because anytime somebody violates the
narrative that's more useful
did i not add jonathan turley
what the hell is wrong with me i i've
had his name here to add about five
times yeah jonathan turley
i'll add him for the next time thank you
great suggestion so remember this is not
about agreeing with them it's only
people who can violate the narrative and
have demonstrated
you know quality thinking that's it
so
um i'm not saying that these will tell
you the truth
you get that right
so the the purpose of the disinformation
board my personal one
is not that they're always right
and they're not fact checkers
they're like a red flag if there's some
 happening
if if there's not a single person on
this list
who questions a story in the news a
specific story
it's probably true
if you see three or four people on this
list and that's not many out of the
whole list if three or four people on
the list say uh
no
you're forgetting this or you're leaving
out this or you got it wrong i would
take that really seriously
because this is the list of people who
if they tell you a fact is wrong
i'm going to listen to that now the
people who are silent on it
might just not have enough information
about it so i wouldn't look at the
percentage of people
i just see who is saying is fake and are
they violating the narrative
all
right i'm loving the fact that there
seems to be some kind of organic
um some kind of organic movement to
improve
the fake news situation
so i'm doing it
right now so this this disinformation
board for myself
i'm really just trying something right
i'm just throwing out an idea
it didn't cost anything just some tweets
if it helps you because you start
following these people and it makes you
better informed then that's great you
see you know just a small little thing
that i can do for my
position
and i feel like lots of people are
trying to do the same thing there's a
whole bunch of people who are thinking
well what could i do like what do i do
um
let me answer this question i'm seeing
on
uh the locals platform somebody's asking
why i didn't add naval ravicon
to my list
he would be you know the most quality
thinker
maybe that i know period
but he also doesn't get into politics
so he's very consistent about staying
out of politics
you know he'll talk about free speech
but that's you know barely political
um
so i wanted people who actually deal
with the stuff that is the is the
subject of fake news most often
all right
so lots of people doing stuff
let me give you some more examples
um bill maher of course
i would like to wake up someday on a
saturday
and
see that bill maher is not trending
which has nothing to do with bill maher
it's just it's just that the reason he
trends is that he's calling out
on his own team
and
you know until he runs out of material
to you know insult his own team and by
the way he insults both teams so he's
not firing it only at his own team
and that's why he's on my list because
he goes after both sides but you see
bill maher
essentially
using his position
to try to make things better and i would
say he is
to me it looks like he's succeeding
wildly
and in a way that i think is really
impressive actually because he's staying
on it he's got the audience he's got the
access and he can he can tell them that
their narrative is is a little messed up
it's probably the best example of what
we're saying
now
a number of people are saying what can
we do about this fake news and
disinformation
and
there is a book you can read
that teaches you how to be more immune
from disinformation
it turns out i wrote it it's called
loser think i think it's behind me
yeah it's behind me it's that one in the
middle
now loserthink is written specifically
for this problem
and it turns out that the
the situation or the times caught up to
me i mean obviously fake news has been a
problem for a number of years
but it's reached some kind of a peak
and now now that the book is out
somebody says nice shell
look it's not a show when you're
talking about your own book it happens
to be exactly aimed at the biggest
problem in the world
so so
there's always some troll who will find
the worst way to spend everything nice
shell
let me tell you some more about the book
i've already been paid
i got an advance
you know most most of my books don't
sell past the advance which means you're
asking for the right events
um
so i'm not even going to make money from
this i won't make a penny if you
buy my book do you understand that
michelle
you understand that
my personal income won't change a bit if
you buy that book because i'm already
paid
i don't i don't even have any
requirement to market it at this point i
mean in the beginning you do
but not at this point that literally the
only reason i'm recommending it this is
exactly the book that's written
for exactly this problem
so
try to deal with that okay
um
all right
so i uh tweeted that out if anybody
hasn't read loser think
it is exactly on target for our current
situation
well i told you that after uh publishing
my comic in which i introduced the new
character dave who is a black engineer
in the dilbert group
got a lot of newspapers who wouldn't run
that
their reasoning was
who knows
i think they some of them just didn't
think it was
worth the
provocation or something
so i'm not sure that there's anybody who
pushed back on it i haven't heard
anybody
yeah let me say this definitively
although a number of newspapers decided
not to run that series
so they just put repeats in there or
left a blank
nobody complained
let me say that again
so i have many client newspapers who run
dilbert thousands of them thousands a
few thousand
not a single one of them
said this is offensive
not one
but a number of them didn't run it do
you know why
was it worth the hassle
that's it just wasn't worth the hassle
or something i i think in some cases you
know different entities within the
newspaper made the decision so
it's not even clear that you know the
decision is some kind of coordinated
decision
i think just somebody said
we don't need this trouble
something like that
now
immediately after that i've got a sunday
comic
that my editor called me and said you
know ah
maybe you'd want to wait a week or so
for this one
now my own editor is very unlikely to
edit me for content
i don't know the last time that happened
actually if ever
i think it's maybe never happened
that i can think of so i've been edited
for lots of other reasons but not for
being too provocative
so let me give a shout out to uh you
know
andrews mcneil and universal press
part of the same company
for being very pro-speech very
pro-creator very
free speech and have always been on the
side of the creator completely
unambiguously on the side of the
creators
now
having said that they're also a business
and so when my editor said you know this
sunday that you submitted
i feel like we need to wait at least a
week
because things are a little too hot
and really that's just managing
managing the clients which is not really
censorship because it'll run it'll just
run a week later when some of the energy
you know is siphoned off
uh so wait for that one it's so hot that
it couldn't be published immediately
and now of course i do it partly for
attention
that's how my business model works right
if you're a creator you have to do some
things sometimes
that are just about attracting attention
it's part of the model everybody
understands that right the reason i put
elon omar on my list of disinformation
board
is partly because i think she believes
there belongs there
but partly because i knew it would make
your hair catch on fire
right so
let me be fully transparent
i am in the kind of business
where sometimes quite overtly and i hope
it's transparent i do things just to get
attention
you get that right i think everybody's
okay with that aren't you as long as i'm
doing it completely
you know in front of you trump does the
same thing
when trump does something to get
attention
you understand it as technique and part
of the part of the process
right
so i asked the question yesterday about
i just asked the twitter public if i
were to sell dilbert
as an intellectual property without my
involvement
so if i were to walk away and just say
okay you can have the
the artwork and the idea and you can
create new content you can make movies
and tvs you can make calendars you can
put words in their mouth you can redraw
them you can do anything you want i just
sell the ip
and i asked the public what did i what
did they think
someone would pay for it
now the reason i did that is not because
i don't know how to put a deal together
a lot of
this is the amazing thing about twitter
just hold this in your head for a second
that this happened yesterday i i just
think i'm taking a walk and i think oh
wouldn't it be interesting to know what
the wisdom of the crowd was sort of the
average opinion because the average
opinion of the crowd
in a weird magical way
will be very similar to what an expert
would say it's worth
do you know why
because because what something is worth
is what somebody's willing to pay for it
that's it
if somebody pays it
i guess that's what it was worth to at
least one person
so
if you ask a bunch of people who don't
know anything about the topic
and then you average their answers
you end up being just about where an
expert is
and it's not a coincidence is because
the expert is
sort of imagining
what anybody else would think in the
same situation
you know sort of a common way of
thinking of a thing
and if the public thinks of a thing a
certain way there's a really good chance
that an expert will think of it that way
too if the average of the public so it's
just one of these weird connections you
don't think should make sense you think
the expert should be completely
different from
the average of people who don't know
anything but it's just a weird
experiment you find out that they're
very similar and the reason is because
we all have a psychologically common
base for understanding what things are
worth
essentially
so i asked that question partly to um
put the idea in the public that is for
sale in case anybody thought of buying
it
but
um
the the interesting part about is
that i get a response from an investment
banker
successful investment banker carol roth
who offered to give me you know some
some deal composition um
concepts
now
where else in the world
do you just ask a question while you're
taking a walk
and one of the most you know qualified
people there could be somebody who
literally was an investment banker
successfully and retired from that
and you get immediate
useful
um advice at the same time this was kind
of blowing my mind a little bit one of
the people who responded to my question
was thomas massey
so he's you know mit graduate congress
person
so i'm getting advice from
a sitting member of congress with an mit
education
if you don't know what that means
you don't get into mit
if you're an average student if you know
what i mean right they don't take
average students
so
how amazing is is twitter
that not only is it going to be
i think our biggest bulwark against fake
news eventually
but that you can just ask a question
like that and get
such qualified responses it's just
ridiculous it's ridiculous
likewise have you noticed how many times
elon musk has responded to average
twitter users in the last few weeks it's
really is mind-blowing every time i see
it
because a lot of the people he's
responding to are people i know
from either from twitter or real life or
both
and to see him how often he responds to
a valid question that catches his
interest
it just makes the world seem so small
but also
it makes the world look like it's
working
that the person who has the best
information on stuff
can answer the question i'll give you an
example
there's somebody on twitter
talking about he was testing i guess
tesla's current version of their
self-driving car
software
and said something like i guess it was a
study that says it was eight times
safer than human driving
eight times safer than human driving
and elon musk saw that and he tweets
this trend
will be well over 10 times safer
with the update that they're working on
right now the software update
so
think about that
the self-driving car is already i don't
know if you can really measure this
because there's no way to know what
self-driving cars would do as scale
that's got to be different than one
season two seas but there is a study if
you want to believe studies
that says that it is eight times
safer than human driven cars in terms of
accidents
now why did elon musk feel he needed to
weigh in on that point
and to modify it from it will be eight
times as successful to 10 times because
that's not much of a difference is it
if somebody told you something was eight
times safer than the alternative
you wouldn't say whoa
i'm not going near that until it's ten
times safer would you
literally there's no in terms of your
decision making there is no difference
between eight times safer and ten times
safer
two times safer would be enough
that's all you needed
your decision would be a no-brainer at
two times better
but eight times better it's it's a
you know there's no conversation at ten
times better you wonder why you even had
to update it well why do we even care is
eight times better
well here's why
have i mentioned that elon musk
understands persuasion better than just
about anybody
i mean he gets it right all the time all
the time he gets it right here's another
example
ten times is way better than eight times
not because it's numerically better i
mean it is that's a pretty big
difference
that would be
25 percent bigger right so that's a big
difference but that's not the important
part
the important part is our brains are
tuned to big round numbers
no reason
it's just what we've been listening to
we're used to it and so 10 times
is
that's the number you can sell
right eight times better
is technical data
ten times better and you can make the
sale and the sale is we need to change
the law so self-driving cars are here
because they're ten times safer
i mean just think of that ten times
safer
that's that's a marketing number
and there's a reason that
tesla doesn't have a marketing
department
and that that elon musk literally runs
the marketing for tesla while he's
tweeting on the toilet
i mean not every time but
enough of the times that it's impressive
and here it is again simply by
emphasizing that the ten times versus
the eight times he's done what his
marketing department couldn't have done
for him
and it becomes from him so it gets more
attention so it's basically he is very
competently
replacing marketing with just tweeting
i mean he actually is doing that it just
doesn't seem like it's possible but he's
doing it right in front of you
all right speaking of technology
there is an amazing amazing story that i
believe no one else has discussed and so
i will discuss it now
because we're right in the middle of a
story that that uh
is going to have an interesting end
point
but when you're in the middle of a story
sometimes you don't know you're in the
story and here's the story
i take you back in the way back machine
to when the united states said you know
if we started manufacturing things in
china
it'd be a lot cheaper
not only would it be a lot cheaper but
we can move the stuff over there that's
dangerous
as uh
you know the the epa would not let us do
in the united states like you know
there's going to be some industrial
waste we can't do that here
how about china
we've got lower standards
so i believe that some of the
manufacturing
move to china was because we couldn't do
it here
some of it was because it was cheaper
and i think the cheaper part became the
important part over time then what
happened next
well the united states suffered
did they not by the lack of
manufacturing jobs
and
we we did the best we could to adjust
people took service jobs that aren't as
good
you know that that's a problem but at
the moment we're at 3.6 unemployment
we're fully employed
3.6 is what economists would call ish in
that range
economists would call that full
employment because you wouldn't want it
any better if it were better it would be
worse
because
that would mean you couldn't hire
anybody
unless you took them from another job
that would be the worst case scenario
you can't hire anybody unless you ruin
another company by taking an employee
that's necessary right you don't want
that
you need you need a little bit of slop
you know 3.6 unemployment is just enough
people who are floating around that you
can hire somebody who doesn't already
have a job
sometimes
and that that seems to be pretty
important to keep everything moving
and so
here we are we gave up all of our
manufacturing and yet
still the biggest economy
here's the interesting part
what happens next
because you saw that biden is pushing 3d
printing
3d printing of products
especially metal products they could
make a rotor for a helicopter
with a 3d printer slap it on the
helicopter and it flies
now
what would be the cost of building a
factory to make there can't be many
helicopter rotors
you know you're not making millions of
them you might make hundreds of them
and
you don't have any shipping you don't
have any foreign language stuff or taxes
or all the difficulty of dealing with a
another culture and nation
you just turn on the printer feed it the
software and it builds you a helicopter
rotor
we are at the
at the precipice
of destroying china
because we turn them into a
manufacturing company with manual labor
and then we're going to obsolete it but
not until we'd already had an
alternative our employment is on track
so we can replace the entire supply
chain concept with 3d printing
robots
and ai
those three technologies ai 3d printing
and robots
completely will take manufacturing
out of the mix
china
is in big trouble
because one of the things i was thinking
about yesterday is
every time there's something that the
united states is especially good at
let's say air power
developing aircraft and owning the sky
something the united states is uniquely
amazing at
they're they tend to be the most
important things
have you noticed that
like owning aviation
well that's like the most important
thing how about space
we seem to be you know thanks to spacex
and other things we seem to be leading
in space
that's going to be really really
important military really really
important and we leave that
so
the united states seems to be really
good at leading at technologies
and things that matter a lot
china
looks like it's going to be really good
at
um controlling their population and
um
i don't know manufacturing which will be
obsolete
i
the the size of china's problem is
immense it's immense i don't know how
they get past it
meanwhile we've got problems with baby
baby formula and
fertilizer and water shortages in the
west and all kinds of food related
things
how worried am i about
all of those things
pretty worried
pretty worried
but they all fall into an interesting
category
of things that humans are good at
working out if they have to
they're all in that category
are you as surprised as i am that we
still have food
because i don't i don't know how that
happened
how did we go through the pandemic
and we still fed ourselves
like i don't know how
how did things just sort of kind of work
yeah now the baby formula is looks like
it could be a serious problem but i'll
bet we'll just you know we'll nurse more
and we'll find substitutes and
there will be do-it-yourself formulas
for making your own formula home and
there'll be
you know some industries that pop up and
somebody else will make it
so
as long as we have time
we can solve all this stuff
i feel as if we'll be okay
i feel as if we'll be okay yet it does
make sense to worry about it and if i
were you i'd i would
make sure i had enough food and toilet
paper to get through
three months
something like that i saw a photo of all
the ships that are docked off of china's
coast and it's just like a solid
you know color of dots
and it looks like it looks like the
whole system is falling apart if you
look at that picture but what the
picture is is lacking
is how many days would it take
for all of that all those ships to be
served
if it's a four day delay i just pick a
random number
it's not really a problem
you can wait four days for your anything
basically
but if it's a year
i don't know what happens that all the
stuff goes bad on the ship i don't know
it seems like pretty bad
and it does seem like we must be working
on fixing even the uh
the port situation and the supply chain
problem there must be tons of people
putting lots of energy into that but let
me go back to the the 3d printing
leapfrog technology
here's a little business
tip that everybody experienced and
business understands but those of you
who are not experienced in business
might be hearing this like a novel
concept for the first time
if you make a product and it's a big hit
you're a private company and everybody
loves your product and they're buying it
like crazy let's say it's technology
because that's a better example it's a
technology product doesn't matter what
it is
what's the first thing you should do
if you have a really successful product
and people love it
the first thing you should do if you are
that company is you should try to put
yourself out of business as fast as
possible
and by that i mean making a new product
that's so good nobody would ever buy
that old product again
it wouldn't make sense
because you have to do that or else
somebody else is going to build that
product
right you have to cannibalize your own
product
in order to move ahead and everybody who
is experienced yeah apple is a perfect
example everybody who's experienced the
business knows this to be true
you have to cannibalize your own product
so somebody else doesn't do it for you
it's the only way you can stay ahead
right yeah amazon does that
basically everybody successful does that
now look at this situation where we
moved our manufacturing
to china that looked exactly like this
i don't know that it was planned in any
way but it's going to work out that way
it's going to work out that we
cannibalize our own manufacturing in
this country
and that that was important for us to
get to the new kind of manufacturing 3d
printing robots ai and we're going to be
experts at those three things and more
while other countries are trying to
figure out what do you do when all these
manufacturing jobs go away
right so we did the play of the century
with with bringing manufacturing to
china and then becoming the experts at
obsoleting that technology
we want everything
we won everything
we just don't know it yet
we won everything
this is this is as hard as you could win
we obsolated our own industry but after
we gave it to china and made them
dependent on it you can't win harder
than that honestly that's as hard as you
can win
now we'll say it depends on us actually
being able to do this 3d printing and
changing the supply chain but i think
that's within our ability
one of the things i learned yesterday is
that our 3d printing capability
is way beyond
what the public
understands
we keep seeing things like oh there's
this 3d printed house
this is just this big machine that puts
down concrete on the walls
and it's kind of cool the first time you
see it
you go okay
it's an automatic concrete machine but
you're calling it a 3d printer okay
but i'm not really that impressed by an
automatic concrete machine
do you know what impresses me
let me say it again
they 3d printed
a helicopter rotor
are we done here
they 3d printed a helicopter router
metal
and slapped it on and it works
wait i'm not done
it didn't just work
it was lighter better and faster and
cheaper
lighter better faster cheaper
that's what kills china
because china can make stuff that's
maybe just as good as 3d printing no
they can't they can't make stuff as good
as 3d printing the regular manufacturing
process would not be close
to being able to
get the specific engineering and i guess
i learned this yesterday this this is
what's different about 3d printing is
that the software
has improved
not just the hardware to print anything
you want
but the software now knows how to print
it that's the big change
so for example it would know that a
component is going to have pressure on
one end of it
let's say there's going to be more
you know physical physics pressure on
one end of it you can just put that into
the machine
say okay this side will have more
pressure and it will end it will just
build it to be solid more solid on one
side
that's just one example
yeah stronger because you could do a
lattice situation with less material now
i think that's the correct answer i'm
being told that it would be all these
things
and i was just sort of filling in from
common sense which might be wrong
that um
let's say if you're doing a
an ordinary metal anything
you would probably it would just be a
solid metal piece right because that's
just the easiest thing to do
you put it in a mold you take it out
it's just solid metal but if you're 3d
printing it at a really fine detail
couldn't you do the the walls of your
device let's say a metal device couldn't
you do it with a little lattice work
little tiny latticework that would use
10 of the material while being stronger
are there enough engineers here i'm
saying yes isn't true
i think i see people agreeing with me
that you can make it lighter stronger
cheaper right that's all you can do all
of it i believe
i believe you can do all of that
all right that's why it's a big deal
what
what is happening in california
i saw this michael schellenberger tweet
and boy would i hate to be running for
governor against michael shellenberger
so he's running as an independent in
california but what as i've told you
many times what he what he does
differently than anybody else politician
is he's written books and done deep
research on the exact problems that
affect a lot of people but california
especially everything from the
the addiction and homelessness to
energy to water
like all those things he became an
expert on
so who wants to run about against that
i mean that's the strongest candidate
i've ever seen
let me say it again
schellenberger is the strongest
political candidate
i've ever seen
now will he get enough attention as an
independent in california
that's that's a tough
that's a tough road but i'll tell you
there's nobody ever did it better so far
it's just ridiculous how good it is and
one of the things he pointed out is that
my state california is being ravaged by
drought
and schallenberger says that
the california under governor newson
has failed to build a single water
storage water recycling or
desalinization project
and i thought
what
it's literally the biggest problem in
the state that we're going to run out of
water
are you telling me that in his entire
term
he hasn't done a single thing that would
be useful
now i realize it takes years to build
these things but at least we should be
looking at something that started
you know we should be talking about the
dam that's almost done or
nothing
and i thought what about the other stuff
well he at least he's working on like
the homeless and the drug problem except
he's doing all the wrong things
he's giving them homes and drugs
that's exactly the wrong thing you want
to do you want to take them and
unfortunately force them into some kind
of treatment because it's a medical
problem it's not a housing problem
that's what schellenberger teaches us
and
i
it does look to me that on all the big
problems
newsome has either done nothing or what
he did was literally the opposite of
what one should do
according to anybody who knows anything
about the topics
yeah they've had plenty of time to do
this stuff that is correct
um
let's talk about the disinformation
board that biden is
especially there there was something
that was bothering me about the
the person that they chose for the head
of it whose name i can't remember so
there's a woman who's chosen to be the
head of the disinformation board and
we're seeing a bunch of her videos and
stuff
and i was trying to figure out what is
the word
that is capturing how i'm feeling about
it and it wasn't until
i saw a glenn greenwald tweet
uh
did they intentionally pick the most
ridiculous person for the job is it just
a troll
and i thought there it is
that was the word ridiculous
ridiculous was the word and that is so
ridiculous it doesn't look serious
to that point i saw a tweet from uh dean
uh
squirrel i believe he's in canada and he
says he i don't really follow american
politics when i first saw this meaning
the video of that head of the
disinformation board when i first saw
this i thought it was an online prank a
slash hoax thing not kidding no i know
he's not kidding
it looks like a prank
it isn't
as far as i know
but doesn't it look exactly like one if
you do something serious
especially something important like this
and it looks like a prank to somebody
who wasn't paying attention
well you did it wrong i think you did it
wrong
all right
um speaking of
disinformation
there are two kinds roughly speaking
one is the kind that's just wrong
information
but the other is diversion
diversion is what keeps us from seeing
the truth sometimes there are lots of
things that keeps us from doing that but
we often get diverted like a magician
makes you look over here all the real
tricks over here so here are some of the
diversions that are happening right now
racism narratives
are a diversion from understanding that
it's really always about rich versus
poor
but if the poor knew that that was what
was going on that is just rich versus
poor
they could easily organize under our
system
because they have free social media
everybody can vote they can just vote
themselves a bunch of benefits
but they don't
because they think the problem is racism
if the poor people said oh the problem
is rich versus poor
let's go vote ourselves some benefits
but it'll never happen because they're
diverted
by racism
now we see the disinformation boards and
the the fact checkers and the fake news
and everything and i feel like what
that's diverting us from is
understanding that our own team is lying
to us also
you know the other team whoever you
think the other team is it doesn't
matter left or right whoever you think
the other team is you're sure they're
lying
you see lots of examples but you're not
so sure about your team aren't you
but
your team's lying too and i think that
when you're talking about fake news and
disinformation boards
uh both sides are then encouraged to
think that their side is right and the
other side is lying
that's a diversion
it's a diversion from the fact that both
both sides are lying all the time
it doesn't mean they're wrong all the
time
i mean
somebody's gonna be right if they're two
different sides uh but the purpose of
the teams is to lie and persuade
that
it was a weird sound
it was a turn
their turkeys gobbling right outside my
door we have lots of wild turkeys here
i hope it's a turkey
so then here's another uh diversion
uh the abortion narrative is diverting
us from the
democrat approval
levels on the democrat record the biden
administration record
everything is
everything is diversion
i get it
see the the turkeys are gobbling at me
because i forgot to put jonathan turley
on my disinformation board
and
and their turkeys
so they're using the simulation to
remind turkey turkey turley
okay got it put them on the information
board disinformation
got it
all right
i don't know how many turkeys there are
out there but i think they're
i think they're massing for an attack
that is a lot of turkey noise
i may take i might take the locals
people over and look at them after we're
done here
all right
this
all right let's talk about some new
disinformation
um
did you see the news
on social media that apparently is fake
news
that pfizer
documents show that the
vaccines were never safe for pregnancy
if people were pregnant or breastfeeding
did any of you see that on social media
some kind of a document that purported
to be a pfizer document
now it's fake news but it would act like
the drug was not tested or wasn't safe
for pregnancy and breastfeeding how many
of you saw that
did you know that that pfizer document
wasn't from a pfizer
document
so all of you who believed you saw a
pfizer document that says they know that
vaccines were not safe during pregnancy
or breastfeeding that was not even a
pfizer document
that was from another entity altogether
it was fake news
and the other entity
apparently has updated their opinion out
of it
so there's actually nothing there there
is no information
about it being safe or unsafe during
pregnancy and breastfeeding
i added the unsafe part just because i'm
unaware of anything
so
pretty much all of the ivermectin
stories
pretty much all of the vaccine oh did
you know about this data story they're
pretty much all fake
you should believe anything about
vaccines any study about vaccines and
any study about ivermectin just assume
it's not real
just assume it's not true
that should be your your starting
assumption if somebody can convince you
it is true well good for them
but you shouldn't start that way you
should start with fake and then if
somebody can convince you well let's see
if they can do it
um
i saw
this is amazing
the head of media matters was on c-span
and
was asked by a caller
uh does about the suspicious nature of
hunter biden getting half a million
dollars for his paintings
and they call her ask how can we be sure
that hunter biden is not selling
influence
as opposed to selling artwork
and the head of media matters uh
uh angelo
curacao
carousone i guess
said quote uh that there uh there's no
reasonable suspicion behind it
in other words there's no reasonable
suspicion that hunter biden is selling
paintings for what seems to be
outrageously high prices because the
people buying the paintings are just in
the influence buying game
there is no reasonable suspicion behind
it
really
really
because to me this is the definition of
reasonable suspicion
not proof
nobody's claiming any proof
has anybody said there's proof nobody
nobody said there's proof
everybody
everybody thinks it's something you
ought to look at a little suspicious
but here's what this made me think
i wondered about the biden family
reunions
when you know that every single thing
that hunter biden does is going to be a
problem for the rest of the family
and then hunter biden says you know
i went to uh rehab
and uh i'm getting off getting off the
drugs
and you can imagine his family and joe
biden and jill and everybody saying oh
that is great that is the best news
so you know we're used to you doing only
the worst possible thing to embarrass us
but thank goodness
thank goodness you're getting off the
drugs and and then you say and and
i'm not going to do any more deals in
china
and then the rest of the biden family
goes
oh god i thought you were going to keep
doing that because that is so
embarrassing to the rest of us thank
goodness you're not going to be doing
the drugs anymore and you're not going
to be dealing deals with china
and then hunter says and
no more deals with ukraine i mean
wouldn't be practical at this point but
no more deals with ukraine and then the
biden family says
thank you
thank you
finally
and then they say so what are you going
to do with your free time
and then hunter biden the black sheep of
the family says oh artwork i'm going to
go into the art business and the family
said ah finally
finally something that will not
embarrass us
and then hunter says yeah i think i
could get quite a bit for these
paintings
and then the hunter family says that's
great
well i you know
we're really happy for you and you're
pretty good painter
so this looks like this could be pretty
good
and then he says yeah i'm going to price
them at half a million dollars a piece
or at least one of them
and then the biden family says
what
i wait for a minute there we thought you
said you were gonna price like one
painting for half a million dollars
and they said yeah i'm gonna price each
painting
for several hundred thousand dollars
and then the biden family says
okay we didn't think we heard you right
there uh it almost sounded like
it almost sounded like you're going to
pay to pay your and so try to sell for
half a million dollars you didn't really
say that did you
and they said yeah
and then the entire bible says
are you serious
you can't do
anything
that doesn't look like a scheme
there of all the things you could do in
the whole world
of all the sports you could do
of all the businesses you could be in
all the things you could invest in the
classes you could take the skills you
could learn all the things in the world
you could do
you have to find the one thing that
would embarrass us
and he does i feel as if joe biden is
living in a simulation
and his theme
is
that
hunter won't stop embarrassing him in
public
and there's just nothing he can do about
it it'll just go from one thing to
another thing to another thing
it looks
almost intentional
doesn't it
i mean it's hard to imagine
that one person could do
thing after thing after thing
that just makes his father look bad who
even does that
like most most people can make their
parents look bad if they try
let's say you get you know drunk driving
arrest well that makes your parents look
bad indirectly sort of a little bit
but we also do other things
most of us
like i've probably done some things that
would have made my parents embarrassed
uh okay i can think of one in particular
i'll give you an example
when i was very new to
media and i had not been media trained
i was asked by a bonus bon appetit
magazine a magazine about food
to do a little special thing in the back
where they'd have some celebrity talk
about their favorite restaurant or
something so i agreed to do it and then
they interviewed me and i made this joke
i said that my mother was the second
worst cook in the world
after her mother
now
that's something that we kind of said in
the family it was like a family joke
that was also
true
it was true
my mother was the inspiration for
dilbert's mother
who had a cooking show called cooking
with salt
it was just salt so basically would you
like your seasoned
about salt
that'll work yeah salt was great i love
salt
but i made this comment to the
the author of bon appetit magazine and i
said to myself
my mother's never going to read bon
appetit magazine am i right
the one thing i don't have to worry
about
is i knew for sure
that my mother living in a little
country mountain place she definitely
was not reading bon appetit magazine and
certainly not reading a cover to cover
to get to the last page
that's how stupid i was
if you can even imagine
that level of media stupidity yep yep
it took approximately
10 seconds
from the publication of that article for
one of my mother's friends to
mail it to her
and say
i hope you've seen this
that's right that's what friends are for
that's what friends are for
so have i ever embarrassed my parents oh
yeah
[Laughter]
yes i have
yes i have as a matter of fact but
the difference between me and hunter
biden
is i still sometimes do things that
don't embarrass people
sometimes i mean not all the time but i
sometimes go into a business
enterprise that
if it worked it would just make
everybody happy
it wouldn't make anybody embarrassed
like how is it the hunter can't find
anything
anything in that domain of don't
embarrass your parents nothing there's
not a single thing he can do that
doesn't embarrass his parents what's up
with that
is your dad a piece of you know
both of my parents are are deceased
um have you read hunter's autobiography
i haven't
all right
so there's no reasonable suspicion
there's anything going on there
all right i believe we've
uh talked about it all except that this
minister of truth
uh started out with some fake news i
think
um so this minister of truth woman the
head of it said
that it's not conservatives it's not
just conservatives who are being
silenced on social media as the
conservatives believe
but that there are many studies many
studies i'm not going to mention them
because there are many of them
oh you want to link to the study i'm not
going to give you a link to the study
there's many studies many many many
studies and these studies show that some
liberals are also being censored
so the idea that censorship is sort of
working against
conservatives
has been debunked and debunked by the
many many studies of which i will not
link and will not mention many many of
them and
it those studies show that
liberals are
censored too
now
did you catch the
trick did you catch the trick that she
used
and then i i used it as well
tell me if these two things are
opposites
most of the
most of the
the media suppression is against
conservatives
but there have been studies that show
that liberals also
have been censored
are those opposites
does one debunk the other
no but she presented them like they do
in other words
she literally
this uh and i don't think this is
delving into personal opinion
i don't think this is a subjective
statement
the head of disinformation
tried to tell us
that these studies would show that there
was the same amount
no she didn't say it this was the clever
part she simply said that the studies
show that
liberals also get banned
i'll bet that's true
i'll bet there's at least one case of
that
two would be plenty if there were ever
two people in the history of banning
and they were liberal and they got
banned then her statement is right the
studies have shown that people on the
left also get banned
it would just take one or two
does she mention how many
no does she compare the rate of
conservatives being banned or suppressed
to the rate
of the other side no
and wasn't that the only question
that was the only question
the only question was how much
for
conservative versus liberal and she
answered it with an absolute instead of
how much
oh they both have
a little problem there
that is intellectually
 dishonest
it is disinformation by design
that is clearly designed as
disinformation her statement could not
have been more clear
to mislead
it was intended to mislead and it did
now when greenwald asked did they
intentionally pick the most ridiculous
person for the job it's not just the way
she looks
because she has a theatrical mannerism
which would probably work great in a lot
of contexts
but not this one
not this one this is the only job you
don't want somebody exactly like that
if you put her in
lots of different jobs i mean you come
up with a dozen right off the top of
your head
where her personality would be perfect
like you know big personality
she's not shy of the camera
you can think of all kinds of jobs she'd
be perfect for but not this one you
don't want somebody who looks like she's
acting
to be your disinformation czar
that's the opposite of what you want
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is everything i wanted to talk about
i believe i have
helped you all to a better life
if you haven't read lose or think
my book
right up there
you really should because it is the
answer to disinformation or at least
it's one of them
so if you would read that book it would
tell you how to spot fake news with very
practical specific things to look for
and once you have that toolbox
you say oh it's one of those
and then you could spot it easily i'll
give you one example
if you see news that's too incredible to
believe
it's because it's almost certainly not
true
the news that makes our hair catch on
fire and go oh i can't believe that
happened
it didn't happen
95 of the time sometimes yes weird
things do happen that's a real thing but
when you see the news that
let's say the news that
the russians were paying the tel we're
paying a bounty for american debt in
afghanistan or something like that like
that would be such a shocking story
that's probably not true
and sure enough there's no confirmation
um
be a turkey volume guessing man
six
like the supreme court made abortion
illegal yeah
so did you know that most abortions are
performed with just a pill
how many of you knew that that's
something i learned from dr drew
and i think dr drew had a interview with
bill maher
and then immediately after dr drew met
with bill maher
bill maher said he learned a lot about
abortion and one of the things he
learned is the same literally the same
thing that dr drew told me when i was on
dr drew show just the other day
he told me that
the vast majority of abortions are just
a pill
i i didn't know that
did you know that
um
well i guess it's a it's a
there's a technical definition of what
an abortion is
so if if there was anything that was
going to
take hold to use non-scientific terms if
anything was on in the process of
becoming a life
and it stopped it from happening
i'm going to call that an abortion
you know you can you can word play it
all you want but
yeah we talked about the horse dewormer
thing
that's just such a big simulation
coincidence
all right uh and then 2000 mules i
haven't seen yet but i plan to as soon
as i find it somewhere
if anybody has a link to somewhere i can
actually see the the actual video 2000
mules will you send it to me on twitter
because people keep telling me where it
is but
i can't find it
or i can't find it in a way that plays i
found it on rumble and it didn't play i
don't know why
oh have you mentioned ultra mega yeah
you thank you i should have mentioned
that so as you know now uh biden is
going with this ultra mega extremist
messaging
so once again
when they don't have an argument
they have to go for a personality
that's what they're doing so it's just
another
you know um
it's just a typical democrat approach
to attack the people in the united
states like entire entire categories of
people
and just dismissing them
but i don't think it's working that
ultra mega thing doesn't seem to be
working
uh and they're also bringing back dark
it's dark concert so the democrats have
not essentially they have given up i was
going to say it's this seems subjective
but i think we can say it objectively
can't we
would it be fair to say just objectively
if if you take your bias
for a second to the degree we can do
that does it look like the democrats
gave up
and and they're only struggling to win
based on personality problems and fake
news and it doesn't look like they're
what they're trying to win on content
the republicans are still definitely
trying to win on content
because they have the strongest case in
the world
well this worked when trump was
president
such as the border
just do that again
do whatever he was doing it must have
been working so they have a pretty
strong argument of practical solutions
you know hire more cops how about that
you got too much crime stop letting
people out of jail how about that right
so they're very practical
solutions even if you prefer them
not to be the solution
but the democrats have just given up
they're not asking for anything that's
real
at this point
it feels like it's just personality and
fear and all that stuff
uh
all right
i've got ultra dark omega mega
the
the ultra dark mega
all right
virtual premiere for what
or the virtual premiere
not for the movie
have you considered that they made the
disinformation position look ridiculous
on purpose
so that people won't see it as a
legitimate threat to their freedom i
don't think so
that that goes into the too clever
category
like i will certainly suspect people of
all kinds of
bad behavior
but when it gets to be that clever i
think
that's a little too clever
right
uh banned adopt videos got what's that
mean
all right
uh did i watch amber turd's performance
yesterday i watched only some clips she
obviously seemed to be acting it didn't
look real at all
so i can't wait to see what happens with
that
my pick for the kentucky derby i think
it's going to be some kind of a horse
probably wins that
um thoughts on the managerial class
that's what the entire dilbert comic is
about
um
he weighed he's waiting for the
cross-examination okay
why was roe versus wade never codified
into law there weren't enough votes
that's why
that's why
see one of the reasons why you don't
want
congress to codify into law
is because
it's because you want the states to do
it
don't you
like why would you piss off half of the
states when all the states all the
states can have what the states want by
a majority if you can give every state
what they want
by a majority within their state why
would you make a national law
that would thwart 50 percent of the
states
that's the opposite of our system our
system is that you want the states to
have as much control
over the things that make sense for them
to control
and you want that you want the states to
have no control over things that doesn't
make sense for them to control such as
national defense
right you don't want them controlling
that but when it comes down to like what
happens to an individual making a really
tough life and death decision
you want to boil that down right as
close to the individual as you can get
it
you know down to the doctor and the
person
if the state's as close as you can get
then i'll take it
but the people want the federal
government to do it want to thwart the
will of the
people
in the state that they don't live in in
many cases
that doesn't seem right
oh i can see it on the local site so
dinesh has a site on locals and if
you're a subscriber you can see it there
uh i don't know if he's he's got a
subscription locked or not you can
unlock things on on locals so
can somebody tell me if is it locked or
unlocked on locals
the 2000 mules somebody will tell me in
a second
locked or unlocked
yeah it's hard to google try googling it
it's locked okay so you'd have to be a
subscriber
somebody says it's free but other people
say it's locked
oh you can't access it until 8 pm
tonight okay so there's a little
ambiguity of it but i'll tell you that
dinesh is doing a great job of marketing
could it could not be a better time at a
better content and
you know he's got he's got just the
right amount of censorship to
to give him some audience
dinesh is locked down on twitter still
somebody says
you can buy it at salem.com at noon
what is salem.com i don't know what that
is
all right that's all for now i'll go
talk to you tomorrow
