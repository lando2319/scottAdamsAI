well everybody on youtube and locals
today i started the stream at the same
time uh i had been trying
to start the local stream a little early
to give you a little extra
but i find that it it it
it detracts from the the
let's say the crispness of the beginning
of the show
so it was started at the same time but
for locals people i'll stay a little bit
after and look at your comments and
answer some questions
but how about everybody else
would you like to make this one of the
best days ever because it's starting to
shape up that way
i mean already it's looking like one of
the best days
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker gels or steiner canteen
joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better yeah you know what it
is
it's called the simultaneous step it
happens now go
oh that's some good stuff well here's
the weirdest thing about me
and it's a long list but here's here's
one of the weirdest things about me for
all of my life i've seen glimpses of my
future
sometimes decades before that future
happened
for example i saw myself as a famous
cartoonist i saw myself
talking to lots of people in some
context i didn't know
i saw where i was going to live i saw
the house i was going to live in
i saw a lot of stuff that happened
exactly like i imagined it
but some of it you say to yourself well
that's just because you worked hard at
your goal and
you knew what you want you wanted and
you got it
but some of them were really weird like
one of them was that
i would someday be invited to the white
house to chat with the president
right and then that happened i actually
got invited to the white house to chat
with the president
now did you see that one coming i didn't
but there was one there's one thing
about my future that was this
really clear vision that was ridiculous
and it just happened just
ridiculous and i realized that it
already happened
actually it happened some time ago but
it's happening again right now and
here's what it is
keep in mind that i have no musical
ability let's let's all agree with that
i've been trying to teach myself to play
drums and i have a drum teacher now
and i think my drum teacher would agree
that i'm nowhere near
being able to play a whole song or
having any any real musical
talent whatsoever none but despite that
i've always had this vision in my head
that i would be a song lyricist
maybe not writing the melody or stuff
but
it doesn't make any sense because i have
no experience in the
in the realm but it turns out i'm
already a song lyricist
and i didn't do anything didn't take any
work
so akira the dawn some of you know him
from twitter
creates music by taking um people who do
podcasts
you know you're jordan peterson's people
like me
and then turning their their language
that they use in their live streams or
their podcast
basically exactly what i'm doing now and
he takes samples out
and turns it into the the vocals
that accompany the music and he just
came out with a whole bunch of new ones
they're not they're not released to you
yet but i got to preview them and
i'll be damned he's invented a whole new
genre
it's it's it's a legitimate entirely new
genre
and i feel like it's going to get bigger
because
almost everybody i know has heard it
likes it it's
just really sort of good stuff so what
he does is he tries to take
and by the way this is the same
technique the beatles used
i'm a big student of the beatles yeah
meaning wave is
where you'll find it um i'm a big
student of the beatles because of their
work process how is it that they got
such
consistently great results and other
people didn't
i'll tell you what the first trick was
they didn't have
any rules about what was in and what was
out
if something sounded good it was him
that's it they a lot of the music wasn't
even musical instruments
it was distorted sounds and putting
microphones in the wrong place in the
piano
and you know adjusting things so they
didn't sound like they normally did
using the feedback instead of the music
so a lot of
a lot of what the beatles did was they'd
come in and they say all right
this is my beatles accent all right do
you have any ideas for a song
and then one of them would say yeah i've
got this a little bit it'll be
you know several lines and and some
music and
they say that's all i got i got this
little bit
and then somebody else would say well
i've got this little bit and my bit has
nothing to do with your bit
musically but let's put them together
because then you'll have two bits that
we like
and then they would put together a whole
song that was basically nonsense
made up of just parts you like and then
it sounded great
and uh in in one way
akira the dawn who does these meaning
wave things he's doing the same
thing because he's taking the good bits
and of what people are saying in
podcasts
you know both me and other people and
putting in them and
putting them to music and
should they i mean the the words were
not written to be in the song but if it
sounds good why not
so i think he's sort of borrowing a
system from the beatles in the sense of
if it sounds good it's music
so there you go one of my lifelong uh
i guess you'd say visions of something
that would happen in my life the least
likely thing that could ever happen in
my life
is happening that's happening in a big
way
it's just weird
meanwhile ron desantis is doing the best
impression i've ever seen
of a g-rated donald trump
imagine if if trump didn't say
you know things like and stuff
in public and
you imagine that he was just toned down
to be the g-rated version
well he'd be ron desantis uh here's what
ron de santa said about
biden biden wanting i guess
passports or whatever for vaccinations
and desantis said
i don't want to hear a blip about coven
from you until you do your job and
secure the border
that's right i don't want to hear a blip
from you
in fact if i could extend this thought
ron
uh desantis governor desantis i don't
think you'll mind if i extend your
thinking a little bit
and say if if you don't secure the
border
you can uh take your bip and just shove
it up your bip
you can suck my bip and uh i hope you
stop and bimp
so go bip you nip everybody who looks
like you and
bip the horse you came in on bip all of
you
so that's the g-rated version of trump
and uh it makes me wonder do you think
the g-rated version of trump can get
elected president
because in a weird way it's what we all
want right
didn't you all say damn it if we could
just get the good parts of trump
you know the parts you voted for without
all the controversy
wouldn't that be good well maybe not
maybe not maybe maybe there's a it's a
package
for a reason it could be that all that
non-g-rated stuff all that provocation
is part of the show
but the show is part of the the work you
got to put on the show
to get the work done sometimes and
that's something that trump
knew better than anybody
all right i would like some t-shirts uh
don't send me these
t-shirts this is just for fun um i would
like one t-shirt this simply has this
message
written really big and i want a bunch of
them so that i can wear them every day
and they should say my face does not
indicate my mood
you've heard of something called resting
 face
where some people just look like they're
unpleasant with their normal face
well i have some some version of that
apparently where uh no matter what
relationship i'm in
or where i am somebody's gonna ask me if
i've got a big problem
who died uh why am i so angry
what made me so upset today and usually
i say something like this
what i'm in a good mood today
just like yesterday and the day before
i'm actually usually in a good mood but
my face doesn't know it
apparently there's some miscommunication
with my face
because from you know face down
everything seems pretty good
it's pretty pretty good um
so i want that one i also want uh one
shirt that has nothing but the message
you are misinterpreting my opinion again
that's it just you are misinterpreting
my opinion
again i'll just wear those every day
i i don't think i would wear anything
else i'll wear them to the store
i'll wear them i'll wear them on live
stream
all right now there's probably nothing
you want more
than for me not to talk about anything
involving
the pandemic right
um somebody says move your phone away
from the speakers
but i don't have any speakers on
and i don't think that's um
i don't think you mean that all right
but there are some really interesting
things that have happened recently
that uh so here's the thing i'm not
going to talk into
wearing masks or vaccinations i i think
i'm pretty much
with my audience at this point
so as of today but maybe for different
reasons
i think many of you who are watching
this would say don't make us wear masks
because masks don't work whereas i say
don't make us wear masks although they
probably work a little bit
and in some cases you probably want them
if you're around old people or something
so we may disagree about whether mass
have any effectiveness whatsoever
but i don't think we disagree at this
point that
you know if you're vaccinated at least
you're kind of done with it
and if you're not vaccinated and you
have the chance to get vaccinated i
don't care if you wear a mask
why do i care you know and and i
also think that the sooner i get the
virus the better
because i'm vaccinated so i'm at my peak
resistance right now and i feel like
i'll probably get it anyway
so you know my my chance i think my
lowest odds of having long coveted
or if i get it now so that's where i'm
at so i think i'm
i agree with most of my audience at this
point but for different reasons
right we just got here a different way
but here's other things that
are new um did you know what's the
difference between an fda
approved vaccine and an emergency use
vaccine anybody anybody how many of you
knew the difference
because one of the big complaints and
it's a good one
is that the vaccinations are not fda
approved
that means something right doesn't that
mean something
so what's the difference between
fda approved and what we've had so far
well dr sanjay gupta answered that
question on cnn
um and if i can be
if i can be objective for 15 seconds
this is really good so cnn did good work
here via
sanjay gupta who often does good work
and so i'd like to give him a shout out
this is the first time i've seen this so
this is like
news that i wanted to see i was actively
asking this exact question
and he answered it it goes like this so
the difference between emergency use
and fda approval is
two months of data for the emergency use
versus full approval would be six months
now don't you want to see six months you
do right
but let me ask you this um
if you had six months of data
would you feel comfortable with that
because i guess the fda is okay with six
months would that be enough
because the six months tell you that the
long-term risks are
uh are fine do
you let me uh block a few people here
anybody who's talking about moderate
audio is going to get blocked
hide that user do
give me give me more moment just gonna
hide some more users
okay um so
i think that the fda approval is
useful because six months is probably a
lot better than two months
but how much difference do you think
there would be between the two month
data
and the six month there we go
there's another one hide this user
yeah everybody who's using the word
crackling and the audio
we're just blocking you all and i know
it's true i'm not arguing whether it's
happening
or not i'm just blocking you for saying
it anyway because it's ruining the show
so anymore anybody else want to get
blocked i'm just
blocking people on youtube now anybody
else
okay we're good for a while um
so here's the other stuff apparently
there's a whole bunch of paperwork and
lawyer stuff
uh and then there's review of
manufacturing facilities which i imagine
would be easy because they're already
manufacturing
um discussions about how it'll be
marketing et cetera
so a lot of it is paperwork and lawyers
but there's also the six month thing
now we've already had six months right
don't you think that we have um
don't you think that we have enough
information that the fda
should at least have all the data right
do you think that if the fda had seen
six months of data which they've
certainly seen by now
don't you think from from the real world
uh if they saw a problem we'd know about
it right
they wouldn't wait for the full cycle to
go through they say wait a minute wait a
minute our six-month data
shows a problem i need a confirmation on
that
but let me just put out the thought that
we already know
if the thing is safe for six months
so can somebody fact check me on that
send me a tweet or something
do we have six months already because
the vaccines have been out
and would the fda have already told us
if that data showed problems i feel like
we're already there
so the question the the part where
people say hey we need
fda approval you're waiting for lawyers
i need a fact check on that right please
but just fact check this if you're
waiting for fda approval
the only thing you're waiting for is
lawyers
has nothing to do with safety anymore
give me a fact check on that i think
that's true
that you you think you're waiting for
the fda to approve it
but you're actually just waiting for
lawyers has nothing to do with safety at
this point
so if that put that factor into your
variables
i tweeted this because i feel as though
the united states is on
a a strategy that can only end in
disaster
and knows it but doesn't know how to get
out of it
and it looks like this there they're
so i said there are two things the best
way to beat the virus and the variants
is a rapid pace of vaccination so
if you could imagine that you could snap
your fingers boop
and everybody was vaccinated but it's
impossible of course
but if you could would that stop the
virus and all the variants
and the answer is yes yes if everybody
got vaccinated
by magic all at once the variance of the
virus would be stopped
but the best way to destroy civilization
might be a sluggish vaccination pace
in other words vaccinating slowly might
be the very worst thing
or too slow if you vaccinate too slow
there's some thought and there's also
some disagreement on this
but that that alone would would spark
evolution of variance
so correct me if i'm wrong the ideal
is that the government wants to
vaccinate fast which might work
the reality is that they're vaccinating
too
slow because there's resistance to
vaccinations
so are we not on a path that largely
guarantees the destruction of
civilization itself
if things went the way it looks like
they're going
is that really a strategy and is the
only hope of beating this
persuading more people to get the
vaccination like really really fast
is that is our only hope persuasion
for you know at least in terms of the
strategy
now let me let me ask you a question
let me ask you a moral and ethical
question and i'm going to use your
opinions to guide my actions
are you ready for this i don't believe
that good persuaders have worked on
the question of vaccinations i think
it's mostly
scientists and and politicians and stuff
doing the best they can to
persuade people but i don't believe
anybody good has worked on it
you know somebody who really has deep
skills of this
but i have some skills if we got to the
point where we knew for sure this was
true
that fast vaccinations would end the
pandemic
but slow vaccinations the path were on
would destroy civilization
i'm exaggerating a little bit but it
would just be the worst case scenario
um i'm not exaggerating a little bit i'm
exaggerating a lot but just say it's the
worst case scenario
is there a point is there a point
where people like me who could be more
persuasive
especially with a platform
when does it become my responsibility
an obligation to talk you into it
does that ever happen that's a serious
question
because it's a question that i'm gonna
have to deal with
and it's life and death right it's
literally life and death
okay karen karen you will be
deleted from the channel um
her name was actually karen that's funny
um
so so here we go we've got we've got
this situation where
um i've got an ethical dilemma because
you know there's a spider-man problem
with
the more influence you have the more
responsibility of
so i i'm sort of accidentally in a
responsible position
that i didn't want because i don't want
to be responsible for your health
not even a little bit do not want to be
responsible for your decisions or your
health that's the last thing i want
but if we're on a path to destruction
and the only thing that looks like he
could stop it
is talking other people into getting
vaccinations really fast
what the hell am i going to do it's
really a problem
yeah i and and i'm certainly sensitive
to the arctic
to the argument that under no
circumstance is it
persuasive but here's the counter
argument
are you ready for the counter argument
if we accept and i think everybody does
that talking somebody into getting a
medical procedure is kind of unethical
they need to make their own decisions
you don't want to influence that too
much if you're not a doctor but at the
same time
here's the counter argument you're all
being persuaded all the time
you're not really making up your own
decision it just feels like that
your decision is the product of the
forces that are
influencing you and a little bit about
your brain architecture and experience
but mostly it's about your influences i
would say
at this point maybe 80 is influences
so you're being persuaded so
if i persuade you you're still being
persuaded
if i don't persuade you you're still
being persuaded
so it could be that the unethical thing
happens no matter what you do
because you're not really making up your
own decisions news is persuading you
social media your friends
you're basically being talked into it
you just don't know it
so if i persuaded you you'd know it and
then it would be my fault
right so i i would have to live out my
days
knowing that i had killed people because
you know
nothing is so safe that somebody isn't
going to die from it
somebody's going to be telling me that
you know their daughter or son
died because of some damn thing that i
talked him into
all right so that's just the dilemma i'm
dealing with right now let me ask you
this question
i asked this on twitter um
if you are currently unvaccinated so
this is only a question for unvaccinated
people
would you agree to get vaccinated if
biden agreed to secure the border
as part of the deal now
you can answer this question in the
comments as well
but the way it was answered by just my
twitter followers so very unscientific
and biased poll
28 when i checked last said yes
28 percent said yes
do you believe that now of course it's
again it's very unscientific it's my
followers etc
but that was way more than i expected
did you think it would be that high
that's close to 25
okay you're funny you're funny but you
maybe you're not wrong we'll see
um here's how i take this
one of the big lessons about persuasion
and one of the things i try to do in
these
live live streams is always teach you
something about persuasion
because if you if you're picking that up
just sort of by watching this content
you're going to be way ahead in life so
here's a lesson on persuasion um it
takes a different approach for every
person
right people don't get persuaded by the
same approach all the time
if you want to if you want to persuade
100 people
you might need 10 different techniques
you know you're lucky if you can get 10
people with a technique
so if you were trying to convince people
to get vaccinated
it looks like there's a substantial pool
of them
who would respond to a deal
they take a deal because you've got this
weird situation where you're asking
people to take a personal risk
like so here's the framing where it all
makes sense
um wait there's somebody else
to block here
all right hide that user all right
and your mic is not your shirt yeah my
mic is on my
shirt i'll get rid of you
hide user all right
so here's here's how i would frame this
uh in the context of the pandemic the
government is asking you to
sacrifice for the collective am i right
so the argument is not just it's good
for you
but that it's good for society that's
why you should get vaccinated even if
you're not worried about yourself
it's good for society what argument does
that sound like
audio is breaking up will hide you
oh let me get my sign out sorry hold on
there you go
so i know that i know the audio is not
fine for some of you
but i'm not going to do anything about
it
i'm not going to do anything about it
because whatever it is it's not
something i control
um so
here is the the lesson i keep getting
interrupted by every
wants to talk about the audio i know
you're trying to help me please
 stop just stop um
i'm just so pissed off i can barely even
talk
do you know some problems yeah
i'm starting to heat up because there
are some problems that
are not big problems but
they are so persistent that the little
problem
you know just gets just gets out of
control
so oh that's a good that's a good idea
somebody says just turn off
youtube that would solve my problem
all right so the point is
that you're being asked to get your
vaccination for society not necessarily
for yourself that is socialism
it's socialism am i right
do you think that there it's a
coincidence that a lot of republicans
don't want the shot
some of it is they don't trust the
government don't trust whatever
that's fine but don't you think that on
some level
getting shots for the benefit of other
people
is socialism doesn't it feel like that
and you're seeing all the democrats it
seems like tell you you should do it
because they like their socialism doing
things for the collective
and the republicans just have sort of a
just a natural aversion to not taking
care of yourself
first which by the way is a way better
system
take care of yourself first and that
that's usually the best
thing for other people this might be an
exception it might be
but here's why i think making a deal
for closing the borders in in return for
vaccinations
could could actually convince maybe
20 or 30 percent of republicans why
because it's a deal it's no longer
uh it's no longer just socialism
it's a deal and how many republicans
really really really want the border to
be closed
and does it seem fair that you should be
sacrificing for the collective
while the borders open how can you ask
me to sacrifice for the collective when
you're not
i need you to sacrifice for the
collective a little bit
then talk to me right if your government
isn't doing the most
basic hygiene for the country don't ask
me to
sacrifice for the country if you're not
even trying
you know we need to be in this together
so that's why the idea of a deal
where biden just says all right all
right if the only way we're going to get
past the pandemic
and get enough people vaccinated is for
me to close the border tight
i hate doing it it's against everything
i believe but i got to do it
would you get vaccinated then a lot of
people said yes
that's never gonna happen but it's an
interesting persuasion lesson i think
all right here's something that pisses
me off a lot
yeah so i'm hearing that there's static
on youtube but it's clear on locals
looks like something on my end but it's
probably not all right um
anyway
i know if if you have my phone number
and you want to text me in the middle of
the live stream
it does help me and it really pisses me
off at the same time
so thank you for helping me you really
pissed me off at the same time
but thank you i mean i appreciate it
um rapid testing so a year ago
the smart people were saying that if we
had rapid testing even if it was
less accurate it would squash the virus
because we could just be testing the
hell out of it
and um and then we could
uh you know even if it wasn't accurate
as
as accurate as other tests we'd still
get on top of it
now it's a year later and the
vaccinations don't seem to be enough
where is my rapid test i know somebody
who has
coveted symptoms who has to wait three
days for a result
three days hey youtube
um we're done with you too many people
complaining about the sound
if you want to go over to uh the locals
platform for the rest of this
uh go to scottadams.locals.com
or see my tweet where there's a where
there's a link
and you can go over to locals normally
it's a subscription service but i opened
it just for this video
so you can see that with no n without
any commercial content and apparently
with
uh without whatever audio problems
you're having so goodbye to youtube
all right youtube's gone um
so uh somebody needs to go to jail
let me say that again as clearly as
possible
somebody needs to go to jail for the
fact that we don't have rapid testing
because maybe
there's something completely legal that
happened that's keeping this from
being widely available but i don't think
so
it almost has to be something illegal to
have stopped something so obviously
useful
from happening it's doable it's useful
it would stop the biggest problem in the
world
we know how to do it it's
straightforward
there's no real argument about the math
of it and we don't have it
tell me one reason that doesn't have to
do with
illegality bribes pharmaceuticals
preventing it whatever tell me one
reason that we don't have that
it's not because of crime it's got to be
crime
somebody needs to be in jail and
i'm talking about
like serious jail i'm talking about you
know 30 years because somebody
is doing something
that is killing hundreds of thousands of
us and crushing the economy
and it's got to be somebody doing it for
money because nobody's going to do it
for any other reason
right even incompetence can't get you
there
it can't be explained by incompetence
politics
can't be explained by science can't be
explained by money
it's got to be crime and why is there
not even a story about it
you know where where is the press doing
the story about
how we would be past the problem already
or at least we'd be handling it much
better
if we had rapid testing and we don't
where's the news why am i asking this
question all right here's the
maybe good news monoclonal antibodies
we now know that a subcutaneous shot
which would be a really tiny needle so
it just gets it into your skin it
doesn't have to go too deep into your
arm or anything
so unlike the regular shots it would
just be a tiny little
a little prick let's say uh
and i guess the results are just amazing
it just
really just knocks out the the covet if
you already have symptoms
it just whacks it out and your odds of
being hospitalized if you get that in
time
within 10 days i guess your odds of
being hospitalized just
drop to practically nothing now
here's my question for those of you
who are afraid of getting the vaccine
would you be afraid of getting the
monoclonal antibodies
and why would one be different is it
because it's different technology is it
because the
monoclonal antibodies have been around
longer and used in different contexts
because my understanding is it would be
a cocktail it would be at least two of
them i think maybe two of them mixed
together
or something like that and
isn't that something that's never been
used for this
i need to look into it first yeah so my
question is
how many people who would not want to
get a vaccination are going to end up
infected
and then when the doctor says well
you're infected our best treatment is
these monoclonal antibodies
are you going to say to them whoa i
didn't get the vaccination
because i wasn't so sure about them you
better not give me the monoclonal
antibodies either
i'll bet zero people will say that
about zero people will say that about
almost every person who said
no to the vaccination will just sort of
routinely say yes to what the doctor
says you got to do now
if you're actually sitting in the
doctor's office with covent
that's been tested and the doctor says
if i put this in your arm
your wrist goes to zero if i don't
you're gonna have a really hard time
and maybe you might die are you gonna
have them put the
uh the monoclonal antibody in you
yeah you are yeah you are
ever every fear you had about the the
vaccination
will just go away and then they'll give
you this other thing that also hasn't
been approved by the fda
for this it's been around long enough
that i wouldn't worry about it
but it's kind of the same question if
you've got
six months of data on the vaccinations
which we do because it's been used for
that long it would have been great if we
had six months before we started to use
them at all
but we have six months now and if the
fda isn't stopping it with the data
they've already seen
i would say that the vaccinations and
the monoclonal antibodies would be
roughly similar risk would you say
they're both things that have been
around long enough
that if there were problems we'd know it
and
they're still kind of newish for this
application
seems like a fairly similar risk to me
all right california recall election for
the governor
is going to have mail-in ballots
can we have an election without covid
please please can we have an election
without any
pandemic just wants please
well um i don't know what that's going
to do to the
california election but let me make a
guess
if gavin newsom wins which i think most
people expect he will
will the republicans feel that the
election was held
fairly huh let me
predict the future
no they think it's unfair so we're
basically creating
just recreating the the big lie
situation as the
democrats like to call it
all right that's all i've got for today
um i will uh figure out what the hell is
wrong with my
audio situation
i will tell you that i have two separate
systems
yeah somebody's saying it's the splitter
it's really the only common system
but do you really think the splitter is
the problem
do you somebody says it sounds like rf
interference
you know one thing it could be oh you
know let me test it
i'm gonna test it on you right so i've
got my
phone here um let me tell you see if i
put it somewhere
if i can create the problem
all right so i'm going to put my phone
right next to
possibly low battery now i don't have a
low battery on anything
everything's plugged in except my phone
and that's fully charged
so you don't hear anything if i get near
you with the phone right
turn the phone off somebody says well
the sound is good right now
um the reason i'm using my phone is
because my none of my printers in the
house work
too loud
next time it happens turn off the phone
i can't because i don't have any
printers in the house they all stopped
working and it's the only way i can see
my notes
so impedance matching is not good with a
splitter
well i'm um my impedance is the same
it goes to the same equipment
yeah the most obvious thing to do is
i'll just use two microphones
and if that's a problem i'd be surprised
i don't think i have a loose connection
because i've got these high-end ion
connections i've checked them all
i might throw my printer off the balcony
so the crack was only on youtube
swap the mics well there's one mic going
to both systems
but i'll do two mics tomorrow
um
i wonder if has to do with which system
turned on first that could be it
uh swap the outputs
well it's got to be something that's
common to both systems all right that's
all for today and i will talk to you
tomorrow
