good morning everybody and can we take a
moment
to just delight
in the beauty of my shirt
now it's just a t-shirt i know but
sometimes when you get exactly the right
color
that fits your eyes
well you know that just tells you it's
all going to work today and believe it
or not
not only is this a peak day for me
with my good shirt and everything but
you too
you too will be joining in in a little
ceremony called the simultaneous sip and
it will signify and kick off
one of the peak experiences of your
whole damn life and it's called coffee
with scott adams and you begin with a
copper mug or a glass of tanker jealous
or sign a canteen jugger flask what kind
of vessel any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
turn on that dopamine faucet
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now all over the world go
now if you're watching this live in a
different time zone
just wait an hour
oh no doesn't work like that
all right well uh
there are some things happening today
you might want me to mention
somebody's somebody thinks my cup is
empty
does anybody want to audit my coffee
coffee cup
all right you spot on it
you called for an audit here it is
let's see
we will adjust our
cameras
for auditing
it's coffee it's the real stuff oh it's
a little watered down
ah
what you're seeing now is
uh one of my broadcasting tricks
i have to put a towel on my desk
otherwise the
lavalier things will be clacking around
yes that's a little bit behind the
scenes
if you're listening to this on a podcast
you're saying
can you please change the subject from
your shirt and your death towel
because those things i cannot see
when i'm
listening now i've told you before the
way you should listen to this live
stream is not like others
so you're not a you're not a passive
participant
you're in a conversation
with somebody who won't stop talking but
that's okay because you have things to
think about and do anyway you're working
out you don't need to be part of the
conversation you can just listen to me
babble
let's talk about biden and the laptop
have i ever told you the story about the
cat is on the roof yes i have i'm not
going to repeat it but the idea is that
you say the cat is on the roof
to soften the blow
because you know the cat's already dead
so you say well it's on the roof and
then the next day you say well it's it
fell off the roof
you know we're seeing how it is and you
sort of slowly break somebody into bad
news so that's called the cat is on the
roof
uh let's talk about biden and the laptop
story that started out with
laptop
i don't even know what you're talking
about
what laptop
i
haven't even heard about such a thing
and that that turned into
oh oh that laptop will you talk about
the laptop that's the russian
disinformation
oh yeah yeah there is a laptop it turns
out the laptop
disinformation laptop
that's what it is okay it's a real
laptop it's not so
maybe it's not so much russian
completely real
the laptop is uh
i don't know about the contents but uh
but that laptop is real that belonged to
a hunter but okay the emails are real
yeah obviously they're real
because they can be
lots of them have been validated so yes
they're real emails but the thing you
have to understand
is that there's no kind of you know
crime you know suggested there
well okay there's plenty of crimes
suggested there in the emails themselves
if you were to read them plenty
but
the important thing is as of today
that
they only involve
potentially hunter biden and maybe
uh joe biden's brother
but there's you know there's nothing on
there that would implicate the the big
guy
oh wait the big guy
the big guy is actually joe biden who is
actually implicated on the emails all
right
so
the laptop is real
uh and the uh
emails are real and they do implicate
president
biden but
i'm sure he's implicated in nothing
that's
going to matter and by the way
have i mentioned he hasn't been
convicted of anything
that's right
sure it's a real laptop and it's real
emails and it really does implicate
hunter and it really does implicate
hunter's uncle but
and it does mention joe biden in the
very same plots
for which those others are implicated
but it's nothing to worry about because
he hasn't been indicted
no core has ruled that biden has done
anything wrong am i right am i right
i mean let's be honest
no court has ruled
that biden has done anything wrong
yet
that's how cnn handles any any good news
about trump
whenever they talk about trump's uh you
know so-called legal problems
and they say well
trump hasn't been found guilty of any of
those legal problems
yet
[Laughter]
they always throw in the yet
so joe biden is completely clear of all
legal problems related to the laptop
and he has not been indicted
yet
all right
um
and uh there's a great article in the
hill by jonathan turley who's pointing
out how the narrative has changed from
uh
you know that's not a real laptop too
yeah it's real but uh
but
it's not really so much a problem
all right
um and even the washington post now you
know everybody's sort of trying to get
ahead in the story a little bit so it
does look
as if they're going to
clip the cord and let hunter and
maybe
joe biden's brother
let them dangle so they can save biden
long enough to get
something good going
do you have any idea what the hell the
democrats are planning
i mean seriously what what are the
what do those meetings sound like i mean
that's the oddest question you know the
whoever is the you know we imagine to be
the big powers in the democratic party
what exactly do those meetings look like
now do they say
i think we can ride this joe biden thing
out
all right it looks bad now
but trust me it's going to be a putin
situation yeah it looks bad at the
moment but he's going to ride it down
it'll be fine
does anybody say that
is there anybody on the the side of
let's just ride this out i think we can
get through four years and and maybe
even get another democrat elected
probably not right
so if they're talking about
not that what are they talking about
is there anybody who's saying you know i
think what would really work
is why don't we replace biden
with the least capable
and least popular
vice president of all time well i don't
know if that's true but let's just say
she's not among the top
i don't know maybe dan quayle was worse
somebody'd have to give me a fact check
on that
um
speaking of camalhairs rasmussen has a
poll
about kamala harris's popularity and 56
say uh they have an unfavorable view of
some kind
uh only 40 percent have a favorable view
and 54 of the
voting public in the united states
believes that the vice president of the
united states is unqualified to be
president
wait
isn't that the one thing we should all
feel fairly comfortable with
now i completely get the idea
that you wouldn't like the politics of
the vice president so you might say oh
that's that's not the politics i would
want in office
but
did we really
really
did we just elect a president who is a
thousand years old
with a package with a vice president
that 54 don't even think she could
handle the basics of the job
like she she'd get lost commuting or
something
they'd have to remind her what her job
is every day or something i don't know
you're right commenter i do look good in
this color blue shirt you see
it wasn't just me
it's a fact
so seriously what the hell are the
democrats saying
i mean honestly this is just a
completely legitimate question
what do they say privately to each other
do they just say well we're just screwed
we're gonna have to
shake the box and live with some
republicans for four to six years and
or are they saying
you we can't change our minds in public
but we need the republicans to save the
country
like are there any democrats
who don't want to publicly change their
opinion of anything
but privately they're thinking i really
hope we lose this time because
the winning isn't working out
right
do you remember when uh trump said that
we get tired of winning
i'll bet you thought he was talking
about republicans didn't you
do you know who's tired of winning
i'll bet the democrats are pretty tired
of winning right now
because they won that whole presidential
thing they got the congress winning
and winning it's looking good
everybody
do you think they're tired of all the
winning
i think they're tired of winning and
they'd like to lose one for a change
am i
right honest to god i think democrats
are hoping to lose
some of them i mean everybody's
individual but don't you think there are
some democrats saying i hope we lose
this next one
some
all right
um
and then the news is also about the news
as it often is the news is about the
news
um oh and let me ask you this i did a
little poll on twitter and i said which
of these two incidents
uh seem more indicative of a
crime committed by a president
so which situation involves the most
evidence so it's the most evidence
of a u.s president involved in a crime
is there more evidence about joe biden
and the laptop situation
or is there more evidence that president
trump did something illegal
relative to january 6.
which one has currently
so we're not talking about where it
might go because anything might happen
but at the moment
is there more is there more solid
public information of crime
on the laptop or the january 6 event
can anybody correct me if i'm wrong so
far there's zero evidence of a trump
crime
am i am i wrong
because you know you always worry that
you're in your own news bubble
but if there's anybody who's seen
outside the bubble
i'm not sure if i do
i i haven't i read cnn every day
and i haven't seen
anybody i i do sample msnbc and cnn
i sample axios all the time
i don't remember seeing any of them
saying there's a specific crime
even alleged am i right
is there even an allegation of a crime
well there's an allegation that
something happened but not not based on
any specific
fact pattern right i don't believe
there's an allegation of a fact
that would support the idea
that trump committed a crime
am i wrong
and i'm making a weird distinction
between an allegation
of a crime which does exist because
every side every side you know blames
the other of a crime which means nothing
in politics right so it doesn't mean
anything that you say the other side is
a criminal
but if you have a specific fact
that if it were true
would pretty much you know say that
somebody's that did something bad
now
all right now
so you a lot of you were pretty
confident in my poll
you know this this reflects my audience
it doesn't really really reflect reality
but 94
said that uh
um
wait
i think i may have this backwards i
think most people said the laptop was
the
one that looked like a serious crime
and
let me ask you this what what crime does
the laptop suggest
can you name one
what would be the crime
the actual crime
that joe biden would be guilty of if all
of it were true
let's say the worst allegations based
you know based on your
really speculation at this point i don't
think we have enough from the emails to
to know a hundred percent of anything
but yeah it looks like a 95 percent
likelihood
yeah i mean i'm seeing lots of suggested
possible crimes but i'm not sure that
there really is one
because i think it's completely legal
isn't it
uh isn't influence peddling completely
legal
now there there's the the the pharah
thing right but nobody ever gets nobody
ever gets convicted of that
i don't know
it seems to me that you've got this like
slight
lobbying problem you know the foreign
lobbying thing
but almost nobody goes to jail for that
because it's so common
is that the worst is that it
that's that's the worst
yeah
i know so you have to be careful of the
fact that you think your team uh didn't
commit any crimes but the other team did
the most likely outcome is that nobody
did
because bull everybody accuses everybody
of a crime in the political context
have you heard the phone calls yet
phone calls of who to what
so probably no because i don't know what
that question is
all right
what do you think about slippery slopes
i i'm going to see if i can add
something with this i always talk about
it and you're sick of it but
do you think that you can identify a
slippery slope
and then
use that idea to predict the future it's
like oh
this just started
it's a slippery slope
so it's just going to slide in that
direction
how many think does slippery slopes
predict
all right now as far as i know there's
no
science
to back your opinion or anybody else's
about whether they predict let's let's
walk through this a little bit
now
would you say that a straight line
prediction is a slippery slope
in other words
let's say uh climate change says that uh
we're gonna keep going in the direction
of more and more co2 and the climate
will warm how often
is a prediction that says things will
keep going the way they're going
how often is that right
well it depends how what your time frame
is right if your time frame is really
short
then it's usually right
things usually go tomorrow literally
tomorrow like 24 hours from today
things usually are the same as they were
yesterday ish but if you you know go out
100 years it's almost never the same so
it has to do with your timeline so when
you say
when you say there's a slippery slope
what are you leaving out
for how long
right if it's a slippery slope between
today and tomorrow
i'm going to say yeah you know
probably if somebody did something today
and it worked out they might do a little
more tomorrow
that is correct but if you said is this
a slippery slope
for 10 years
i'd say well first of all it depends on
the topic i suppose you know this is
something that changes quickly or
doesn't
but probably 10 years you can't predict
anything
do you know who says that
everybody
nobody disagrees with that there's
nobody in the world who predicts
anything about anything who believes
that anybody can predict 10 years in the
future
that's not a thing
so
if there's no predicting of 10 years
this slippery slope
probably has at least
you know a limit in terms of time would
you not say
so
my view is even more harsh on the
slippery slope i believe that people
start start with a conclusion and they
reason backwards and the reason i think
that is because that's the only way we
think
it's not special to this topic
and unfortunately it's something that
hypnotists learn on day one
that people think backwards
we we decide and then we we reason
backwards to why we decided we don't we
don't think of reasons and then decide
that's purely an illusion
there are probably some exceptions
like in the scientific process for
example
but the way you normally just navigate
your life
is you make decisions and then you come
up with some idea of why you
did it
uh yeah it's totally against my
philosophy for my entire life
but the reason i did it this time is
because uh i had a bad cold and it
wasn't thinking straight yeah we just
have dumb reasons for everything we do
so here's what i think the slippery
slope is it's a backwards
rationalization
we just say to ourselves uh oh i'm
afraid that x will happen
and now i need a reason to support why
i'm afraid of something irrationally oh
there's a slippery slope
there we go
i've reasoned backwards that the thing
i'm irrationally afraid of has some kind
of logical
path to it and i'll call it a slippery
slope
isn't slippery slope the thing he passed
a sale
let me think about that
yeah i guess it is
a good point
if you say something's a slippery slope
you're making people argue about how
slippery it is
and not whether it's going to happen at
all
yeah in a sense i guess it is
not not
as direct as most things
um
will i'm being asked will russians
continue to love putin let's change the
topic
and i say um
the putin
situation
is a perfect example of the difference
between wanting something and deciding
and i talked about that distinction in
terms of you know personal growth and
success
wanting success doesn't give you much of
anything
but deciding to get it
probably gives you everything
and until you learn that distinction
it's hard to get off the couch
right sitting around wanting things buys
you just about nothing
but deciding you're going to do it means
that you're going to eat whatever
garbage you have to you're going to take
as little sleep endure as much pain
you've just decided
right
for example
i didn't want to go to college
i didn't want to go
i freaking decided
and you know sure surely there were
obstacles and you know reasons to drop
out at different points
and
but i decided
so once you decide it just simplifies
everything this is going to hurt this is
really going to hurt if you keep doing
this
yup
yes it is
yeah if you do this there's a risk
you'll die
yes there is
all right a decision just simplifies
everything
and the question about russia comes down
to has putin
decided
or does he just want
whatever you know whatever it is he
wants that we're not exactly sure about
does he want it or has he decided
because if he's decided
well then he'll get it
because he'll get it at any cost
and he certainly seems to be in the
realm of somebody who could
absorb large costs and
make it work for him at least
and maybe even make it work for russia i
hate to say it but
he may be sacrificing a lot in the short
run
for what could turn out to be like the
you know like some kind of thomas
jefferson land deal
louisiana purchase you know in when we
look at it
a hundred years from now
you might be looking at this big
prosperous russia
that putin built and you forget about
how brutal he was and you say well
he sure was successful
sort of like you do with genghis khan
like when we talk about you know
is it jengas or genghis jenga's khan
we we sort of talk about how awesome he
was right how much territory he
conquered and how many children he sired
through his many concubines and whatever
we don't really talk about how
amazingly awful he was like beyond
probably anything we could imagine
and putin could have the same thing so
if putin has decided
i'm pretty sure he'll survive
and
he'll end up with more
territory and
somebody says it's a jingus or chingus
i don't know maybe
yeah
so
if i had to guess
and let's do the the armchair thing
where we we try to imagine that we know
what's in putin's head
you know good luck with that
um
if i had to guess
i think he's decided
what do you think
has has putin decided
to take ukraine or does he just want it
which would suggest he'll take something
or less than what he wants
looking at your uh i think it's gonna be
mostly yes's
all right um
looping back to the slippery slope i
mean the slippery slope isn't everything
right if putin takes uh ukraine
it's a slippery slope until he takes the
balkans
am i right
that's the argument is that if he can
get away with it why wouldn't he keep
going
so
here is my counter to the slippery slope
besides the fact that it's backwards
thinking
there's a better frame
if even if you imagine that the slippery
slope is telling you something and it is
predictive
and let's say for the moment that i'll
acknowledge that
i think in some cases it's kind of
predictive
just not all of them
and
so so let me just say yeah there's sort
of a
there could be a domino effect or uh
follow the leader or you know it gets
into people's minds etc
but here's the better frame
follow the money
that's it
if you have two frames that both predict
but one does a 60 percent of the time
good prediction which would be very
useful if you had if you had a way to
predict the future
that was right sixty percent of the time
i think you become a billionaire
right i mean if you could do that i
don't know that anybody could do that
has anybody ever predicted the future
sixty percent of the time accurately
i don't know
um that'd be a lot
but if you have a different frame that
can do way better than that which is
follow the money
i assert that follow the money works
eighty percent of the time
and that the twenty percent you don't
know about
uh usually is because there's a time lag
so so folly that follow the money is
still going to work it just hasn't
worked yet right like there might be an
intermediate step that looks like it's
not working but it's going to work if
you just wait
for all of the money works basically 80
of the time maybe all the time
so that's my argument against the
slippery slope it's just not as good as
other arguments even if it kind of works
or other frames
all right
um
what do you think uh about the question
of whether russia is winning or losing
or or ukraine is winning or losing
uh based on the propaganda that you've
seen
is russia winning or
tell me who's winning russia or ukraine
who's winning
now this is just based on what you see
in the news because you're not there
all right so there there are two frames
while you're watching your answers there
one frame is that the plucky ukrainians
have driven the russians away from kiev
which certainly had to be their main
objective
and
since the main
objective of taking over the capital and
getting zielinski seems to be
uh pushed away
that would suggest that russia's is
losing and maybe they're trying to just
hold on to the territories that they
they already have so that's one
one narrative
the other narrative is
that uh military always tries to quote
shape the battlefield this is sort of
the scott ritter
narrative and an army that shapes the
battlefield
would do things such as
try to distract
the other army try to make them think
that your your motive is over here but
it's really over there trying to bog
down their military
trying to basically change the landscape
by inserting variables that just make
things difficult for the other team
and yeah i'm saying in the comments that
shaping is military doctrine it's pretty
apparently it's just ordinary military
way
so the more
ordinary way to look at what russia is
doing
is that by threatening kiev which would
have been too expensive to take
which we all thought was the case right
or at least a lot of us did that taking
kiev would be such a bloodbath that
there's no way that putin could do it
and and make everything work i mean it
would just be too much
so instead it looks like
what they may have done
and we don't know
but it looks like what they may have
done okay
kiev whatever you want to call it
what they may have done
is
surround kiev
um in order to keep the ukrainians busy
there so that they could consolidate
things in the in the uh the south and
the east
and then once they were done there they
would consolidate their armies and then
you know really
completely own the parts that they
already control
and then move toward
taking whatever else they need so they
could basically
force kiev to
submit without directly attacking it
which would be the best way to to do it
now
suppose you said to yourself
all these military experts in russia
they
they've heard of this right
it's not like you and i are making up
making up military doctrine seems like
it's fairly standard stuff
um
so
so this would be supportive of the
theory
that if putin has decided
to take ukraine he always had a
long-term
um
that he that he always had a long-term
view of it
and that the idea that he could take uh
kiev or kiev
the capital the idea that he could take
that in 48 hours might have been russian
disinformation
maybe russia is the one who started the
idea that they could take over in two
days
so that everybody was looking for the
blitzkrieg that wasn't going to work but
they never planned to do that anyway
they always plan to do it the slow
slow way
now i saw an estimate on
twitter that i don't believe
that that only a thousand
non-military people
have died in ukraine
is that you know i'm talking about just
the citizens the the population
that's not right is it
only a thousand casualties among
non-military people in ukraine we're not
talking about the russian side
yeah that doesn't sound right
but what if it is
what if it is right
are you
sure i don't know if there's any way to
to know at this point right
yeah i thought yeah i mean let's let's
put in the obligatory a thousand is too
many
you know it's a tragedy all right now
let's talk about the
uh how many of you saw the clips
of what looked like massive war crimes
in uh what was it buca or bucha or
something that one town that
the
russians have left and you saw video
that we have not verified
we meaning anybody
unverified video of what looked like
handcuffed prisoners who had been
executed and dumped all over the road
right how many of you believe that that
was a real video and not propaganda
and and how many of you had a
initial reaction which morphed a little
bit as you heard other people
weigh in
now
what i've been doing recently and i'm
not sure that i'm doing a good service
here is that when i see one of these
videos that looks to be like it's
you know at least possible or even
probable propaganda
if it's being promoted by any kind of
legitimate source
i'll usually start out by just tweeting
it or retweeting it
because it's news
which is not you know endorsing it
necessarily but
after sort of digesting things for a few
hours sometimes maybe the next day
i'll tell myself you know i'm not sure
that we have sources for any of that and
that that would be easy to fake and
everything else is fake so why would you
believe this and so slowly i kind of
talk myself out of everything that's my
first reaction
so my first reaction was probably like
everybody else's which was oh my god
it's
that looks like the worst war crime
we've seen since world war ii
i doubt it's the worst one but
you know in terms of our consciousness
it feels like that and
then what happened was
a number of voices on twitter in
particular
started doubting the
accuracy of that video
and a number of people pointed out
uh
income
incongruencies
i don't know if those were true i'm not
even sure if they i don't know if the
critics were accurate in their what they
pointed out either
but
um
you saw the narrative sort to
give up didn't you
i feel as if the the media
did say they couldn't verify it
they still ran it
and made you think it was real
uh as war propaganda probably worked
really well
so whether it was real or not i mean it
was packaged as propaganda by the
ukrainians
so
here's what is interesting
so the
the narrative comes out in the fog of
war that there's this gigantic war crime
it's very suspicious because of the
source and
you know the situation
i believe that the
the wave of belief
was turned back by what i call the
internet dads
now
uh to be a little less sexist i'm not
saying it's all male
okay and i'm not saying it's people who
have you know children
i'm using just a general phrase here so
the internet dads to include internet
moms and and you know everybody else
but but there are yeah you could call it
the adults in the room but
people have been calling it the dad so
i'll just use that
and
yeah mike cernovich
i would say chief among that group
and that group has enough influence now
that i feel that
the major media had to pay attention
that the internet dads
people with credibility and big
followings
were saying it looked like to
them
now
as have any of you watched it closely
enough to feel like that's what happened
or was it going to happen anyway
because because i feel like
um
i i feel as though
the balance of power is really starting
to change
and at the same time
that this other force is sort of
developing
that you know the
i'll call them independent voices
you know they're podcasters they're
they're tweeters or people with big
audiences
i feel like the counterbalance was
really productive this time
don't you
did you see the same thing i saw
now
in the context
of the
the internet dads balancing out the
major media what's the biggest obstacle
that the internet dads have
working against them
in the comments see if you can get ahead
of me here what's the biggest limiter or
limitation that the internet dads have
the algorithm right i don't want to say
sensory censorship
because
if you say censorship that's
it reads the intention into something
that's not demonstrated to have
intention yet
it has effect
i mean we can see what we think is the
effect as alleged effect i guess
so in the context where we worry that
the only thing limiting the the sensible
counter voices to the unsensible news
elon musk
just bought
the biggest share of twitter that
anybody owns including jack dorsey
it's like several times more shares than
jack dorsey currently owns
elon musk who was asking about
censorship and about you know the the
big platforms and asked if he should
start one
put his money where his mouth is
bought 9.2 percent of twitter this
morning
ish
and now he's the largest
shareholder
i should
give you a disclosure here
i do own twitter stock and i do own
tesla stock
and i tried to sign up for truth social
but i couldn't get in
and there's a
like a related story to all these
stories that choose social i think they
lost one of their
people who is uh
managing that thing
and it doesn't look as though um the
launch was successful
so far
all right looks like it's late and it's
not on android and it's not on a web
browser yet so it doesn't look like it's
successful
and it's not going to help one bit that
elon musk
just bought into twitter
because
truth social should be a solution to
what people
believe is censorship
but if elon musk
becomes the most influential voice and i
don't know that that can happen but
we'll see
if elon musk becomes the most
influential insider
at twitter
what's the first thing he's likely to do
like what what's the first change
he's likely to promote
if he had to guess
and here's the weird part
here's my guess
i think the first change that elon musk
is going to
make just to guess
is jack dorsey's plan
how weird is that
because jack dorsey's been saying for
how many years
that he thinks the platform should have
your choice of algorithms so if you just
want to see everything that would just
be your choice
and if you wanted to see it filtered by
somebody else's filter
you'd see how they filter and you just
choose it
now i always wondered why is
jack dorsey
saying that
the platform should be like that but i
saw nothing coming on twitter
that was going to do that thing
did i miss something
like why was the most important voice at
twitter saying we should do this but it
wasn't happening
and for years
or did it happen then it was
in some small way
that i didn't notice
all right so then jack dorsey leaves
who knows who knows what the story was
behind that right shareholders blah blah
blah personal reasons who knows
but then
elon musk comes in
i can't think of anybody more likely to
implement jack dorsey's plan
maybe jack dorsey didn't own enough
stock to get it done
maybe
i mean you if you stay anywhere long
enough you're going to develop you know
competing interests and other
shareholders and stuff like that so elon
musk comes in with
probably nothing except
a social agenda
i doubt he bought this as a pure
investment right
can we all agree with that
i think we would agree that elon musk
did not buy twitter as a pure investment
do you know why
i don't think he invests in stuff like
that
it's not really
i don't think it's his wheelhouse really
i think he did it for purely social
reasons and he broadcast it he
broadcasted as cleanly as you could
broadcast any message he asked in public
should i start a social
you know media network
um
do you think that censorship is being
handled right or however he asked it so
he's being
as transparent as anything could ever be
and then he's probably going to take
that same level of transparency
that he's taking into this transaction i
think he'll take it into the product
itself
because remember what elon musk is more
than anything
he's a product guy
he's the ultimate product guy
in fact
maybe steve jobs you could say
but it's hard to think of somebody who's
more product oriented versus marketing
let's say
that in fact
elon musk does the product so well that
he doesn't need marketing
he just does it himself tweeting from
the toilet as i like to say
and
so the only explanation is that he's
doing it to make
twitter more transparent
and it would be kind of embarrassing if
it works
meaning it would be embarrassing to the
other
any other platform that doesn't
but i would not want to be
owning getter or
any competitor to twitter
because the only problem twitter has in
my opinion
is the one thing that jack dorsey said
it should do and hasn't done yet
but elon musk
knows how to make a product work
and there's one thing that's wrong with
twitter it's just it's just broken
am i right it's a product that just has
a glaring flaw
and the guy who fixes glaring flaws
it probably makes him crazy
can you can you imagine being
somebody who has the you know the
engineering physics uh
you know product design knowledge of an
elon musk and then looking at this
product twitter and seeing it's just
massively broken in this most critical
way
the transparency of the algorithm
and and the censorship element and
knowing you could just fix it
just just buy the damn thing just fix it
now my guess is that he's tiptoe again
and seeing what he can get done with 9.2
percent
probably a lot
but that's not
full control right
now i would also guess that there will
be some large number of other twitter
shareholders
likely to
throw in
in a proxy sense
behind elon
suppose well i'm one okay i'll use
myself as an example so i own i own
stock and twitter
and if elon musk said hey
we're going to have this i don't know
vote
i'm gonna push for a vote
um can you make sure that you sign your
proxy vote
if elon musk asked me to sign it because
he said this is how you fix
censorship
outside the thing all right and
i never signed those
i never do that because i always say
guys somebody else will sign it
you know they'll get enough people
signing their proxy then you know i
don't have to do it i never do it
but if you're given given elon musk's
credibility
especially in this you know specific
domain censorship i mean he's very
consistent and i think i think most
people
almost everybody
would think he's on the right track if
he opens up to transparency
so
the
i think elon musk is correct
in his first assumption
and again this is all just speculation i
can't see inside his mind
as i often say if i could see inside
elon musk's mind
i would have started tesla
why would i wait for him to do it
i would i would have built myself a
rocket ship to mars if i could do what
he could do
but i can't see inside his mind and
neither can you but it seems to me from
an outsider's perspective if you wanted
to limit your risk while getting the
most leverage you would buy 9.2 of
twitter
that's enough to get everybody's
attention and say okay i'm the lion king
of shareholders
and then just organize the other
shareholders
it's easier to organize the others than
to buy their shares
because i think he could right uniquely
he could not many people could do that
or who else could really
it'd be hard to think of somebody else
who could
all right so twitter stock was up like
21 last time i looked
and as i said i own both
tesla stock and twitter stock so
so discount everything i say by my bias
how many of you think that truth social
is going to work
because it will
it will attract basically nobody on the
left who disagrees right
and what would be the point of it
the reason i'm on twitter is because
that's where the
the mainstream media is
that's where all the energy is if the
mainstream media decides to
choke truth social and they will
i'm not even sure that the right wing
or i'd like to say right leaning i don't
even think the right leaning press
is likely to go big on truth do you know
why
it's competition
truth social is just a news network
just packaged as a social media network
so if you're in the news business
i'm not so sure you want them to succeed
do you
right
so
um i don't know how truth will solve the
problem of not having
enough energy because there's not enough
conflict
you know if you take out the thing that
makes it work
the conflict why would it work
all right
okay
we have 30 times the followers on truth
social so you think shadow banning is
real what could it have to do with the
fact that
there's nobody except people who agree
with you on there
yeah right the problem is everyone
agrees okay
all right ladies and gentlemen
that
is the amazing amazing
meat of the show we are now in bonus
territory right this bonus territory
uh this is the part where you tell me
what i forgot to mention
um yeah it's the best show ever you're
right
stop it
i'm embarrassed now
um
you know
locals somebody's making a comparison
between truth
and locals so locals
as i'm on the subscription network
uh that's different because i don't
think people are there for the fight
on locals i think people are there
because there's a
you usually the central person
has a point of view that they
you know enjoy it's more more of an
entertainment i think
so when i put when i put material on
locals i think of it as just
entertainment
and also it's the edgy stuff so i can i
can put the stuff there that
now
um does anybody know uh snoop dogg
i'm gonna do a kevin bacon thing here
anybody does anybody know snoop dogg uh
didn't carmen diaz uh
go to high school with him and here's
why
uh i want to invite snoop dogg to my man
cave
and i want to interview him and see
which of us will
last the longest
if you know what i mean
perfect example of something that i can
say more clearly on the locals platform
oink wink
but uh here on here on youtube it's a
more family-friendly uh environment and
let me just say the snoop dogg and i
could uh have a conversation and maybe
compete
possibly fix all the problems in the
world
and
and you might say to yourself
what are the odds of snoop dogg would
come to my garage
i would say the odds are really really
small
but
it would be amazing
wouldn't it
come on it would be amazing
so one of the things i'm thinking of
doing is uh
doing man cave
interviews
but i only want to do it if somebody can
come to the man cave
i don't want to do it remotely
so there you go
yeah you'd watch you know you'd watch
all right let me ask you this question
uh aside from
snoop dogg
um aside from him
who would be the most interesting thing
i could interview and think about not
just that it's an interesting person but
somebody that you think i uniquely would
be the right person to interview either
because if it's entertaining or
i'd ask the right questions or something
so who would be
you think trump
all right let me tell you something that
i could guarantee you
here's something i guarantee you that me
interviewing trump would be the best
trump interview you ever saw
i guarantee it
i guarantee it
i don't know how it could miss i really
don't
because i think everybody does it wrong
do you know what they do wrong let's see
if you know
how does everybody do it wrong and by
the way i'm going to make one exception
i've seen one person do it exactly right
and i think i could i could do something
in that vein as well
yeah greg guffeld
i i think guffeld did the best job
because he humanized him
like you could tell that they just liked
each other
and so
like he got he got like a little human
look out of him
so i i think that's the thing i could do
better than
um better than somebody who does
interviews for a living because i think
when you do interviews for a living
especially depending on what platform
you're on you're sort of driven toward a
a certain level of professionalism
that i think
distracts from a good good entertainment
and that's what uh that's what greg
goffeld gets right
he never lets the professionalism uh
ruin the job
do you know what i mean
as soon as the professionalism is more
important than the product
then the product suffers but he does
product first professionalism second so
you get and that's why he has two hey
shows
um interview ben shapiro
yeah i don't know that uh me
interviewing ben shapiro would produce
like any headlines
i think i would just agree with what he
said and
then there would be no
no spark there
yeah jordan
peterson that would be interesting
and
i i'm especially interested in his
religious interpretations of recent
which i want to look into a little bit i
want to hear it in his own words
because i'm considering that one of the
most
let's say unpredictable
evolutions that i've seen
i would not have
predicted uh jordan peterson's is it is
it a change i don't even know if it's a
change really maybe it's just something
we're hearing more about but i think
it's of evolution right
to a more uh religious
frame and i'm gonna say frame because i
i think he puts it in
i think he puts it in terms of you know
living
as if it's real is that true
i hate to try to paraphrase other people
he says he doesn't believe it literally
just has
he he likes the utility of it is that it
because that wouldn't be far from my own
view
my own view is
if you don't know my view on religion is
that i'm not personally i'm not a
believer but i'm very pro religion
because it's just so obvious it works
i mean why would i be against something
that works
now
i don't know that there's any science
behind that but the only the only
studies i've seen or that people have a
faith-based
view of the world
seem to be happier
seem to be more prosperous seem to do
fewer drugs
you know there's something about
thinking that somebody's watching you
all the time
and you know loves you and is judging
you i guess
that probably has some
you know
some guard rail effect on your behavior
and if as long as people have a choice
you know they can they can enter a
religion they can leave it which is the
beauty of america
uh
as long as they have a choice
if they're picking a frame that works
that works for me now in the old days
when i was younger and dumber
i used to say
uh whatever it is i'm thinking today is
right
and all those other people
how dumb could they be or
and
the older you get
the if you do it right
if you do it right
your humility should increase not
decrease
so i started out with no humility
meaning i was pretty pretty sure
i had the whole god situation figured
out and other people didn't and there
was something wrong with them
and but the longer you live you realize
that
more and more things you thought were
clearly true
they just like evaporate
if i could tell you
how many things i believed were
absolutely true
five years ago
that
and i'm talking about a lifetime of
having truths evaporate like every year
something that was true disappears
again i mean like really big stuff i'm
talking about
really basic
things about even who you are
like a belief about
like what happened to you in the last
five years just really basic stuff
and
so the longer i live the more humility i
get
because everything i think i believe now
i have a little message that says
yeah yeah you're pretty sure this time
aren't you do you know how many times
you've been sure before
yes you do yes you do
you do know you do now don't change the
subject scott you know how many times
you were sure before
and then found out you were totally
wrong
do you remember that i'm not trying to
think about you think about it think
about it scott
don't no don't not think about it that's
how you get cognitive distance think
about it
so that's something you can do as you
get older
like you're in
if you do it right right
if you do it right
you will remember how many times you
were wrong and that was one of the
motivations behind
that book behind you that behind me
where i'm pointing
that had it failed almost everything and
still win big by cataloging all the
things that i'd failed at
it was both a reminder to myself
how many things i was sure about that
didn't work out
but also a way to tell other people
that even people who you know for whom
life worked out fairly well
that were wrong all the time
i mean the the number of times we're
certain and wrong
is just shocking
no matter how successful you end up
so and that that helps people understand
that their their own certainty
is worth questioning
um
uh how sad to take the substance of god
out and just embrace the utilitarian
aspect
well
i don't know is it sad or is it just a
frame that works for some people and not
for others
now for me the the simulation
hypothesis is the most predictive
right so here's another prediction
there will never be anything true about
our reality whatever you would call this
thing
that is not also true
for a simulated world
meaning that a simulated world would
have resource constraints it wouldn't
have infinite memory you know it would
be a bunch of things that would be true
true for software
so my prediction is there will never be
anything true
in in our so-called real world that
isn't just as true for software
because we can never get out of that
model
very specific prediction
okay
so we'll see
somebody says god is utilitarian
interview sam harris again
yeah you know i'd love to
it'll be good
uh kanye would be good
maybe kanye would actually do it
i mean it'd be more more of a resource
question he can't be everywhere and do
everything
all right that's all i got for today oh
bill maher oh wow
that would be interesting
imagine me having bill maher on
and having a video
prepared to debunk the fine people hoax
and the bleach drinking hoax
and just say
just two things i want to talk to you
about
and
and that's it i just want to show you
the full video
and then tell you what you show you what
you saw
and then i'll tell you i i literally
personally interviewed people who
attended the charlottesville thing and
found several of them who claimed that
they disavow all racism
and they were just there about the
statues and the historical element of it
and just see what he says
because here's the thing
the the thing that i i keep saying about
bill maher about why he's so dangerous
is that he is he's a shape-shifter
um well that sounds
that sounds negative i mean this to be
positive
he he is capable of entering your bubble
and looking around
who can do that
i mean really who can do that not many
people it's a it's a really small list
of people who can just walk outside
their bubble if they choose to right
it's the choosing to
that is where the little challenge is
but if they want to and they have a
reason to and somebody alerts them to a
good reason to do it
they have the ability to open their
little door and walk out of their little
little bubble and knock on the other
bubble and go inside and see what's
happening
there's only a few people who can do
that
and he's one so a conversation with him
if if i could you know invite him into
the other bubble
just to look around
you know just to check out the furniture
it would be pretty interesting wouldn't
it
that would be really interesting
all right and uh if there were
if there were anybody i thought i had a
shot of getting to the band cave
uh i would think the odds would be
pretty good in his case
um russell brand will become more
productive with your persuasion frame
yeah you know russell brand is fun isn't
he
um is it my imagination or is he also
able to i think that's the context
you're mentioning he does seem to be
able to check everybody's bubble doesn't
he
am i right about that those of you have
been watching with well yeah
um joe rogan same thing
joe rogan uh is bubble free
people will
try to characterize him in one bubble or
the other but
i don't think he sticks i think he's
bubble free
um
yeah
i think russell brand found his exact um
place
don't you
you know i i like like him as a
stand-up i've liked him as an actor
but when you look at his talent stack
you know if you look at his verbal
skills see see the point of what's the
point of being
doing scripted material
when you have his his capacity
like that's a complete waste
and he should be in an unscripted you
know semi-scripted
um bounded but unscripted
scenario and that's what he's doing
so and then he also doesn't have like
constraints right there's nobody writing
lines for him and telling him do this
more of that so
he's really the
um
yeah
somebody says uh carl says brands
awareness
as in mdt mushrooms is off the chart
that is correct he is off the chart
so
um
now he'd be an example of somebody that
i don't know if he and i would have any
reason to talk because we'd end up just
agreeing i think
chris rock
yeah
he'd be the hardest interview in the
world
matt damon why matt damon he'd be i like
matt damon but why
dave chappelle oh that'd be interesting
i don't think i could get him to come
well i probably couldn't get anybody to
come but
all right that's all for now
and i will talk to you on
youtube tomorrow oh and before i go
i don't know if anybody's noticed this
but uh madonna has slowly evolved into
jar jar binks
and
i didn't want to be the first one to
mention it but
it's important
see you tomorrow
