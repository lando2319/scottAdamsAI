[Applause]
hey everybody
come on in come on in it's going to be a
good one
you're going to learn things today and
i'm going to unveil my linguistic kill
shot
for awokeness yeah you've been waiting
for that
took me a while but to make this day
extra special here's what we're going to
do we're going to maximize it by
grabbing your closest copper marker
glass to tank your chalice or stein a
canteen jug or flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
join me now for unparalleled pleasure
the doping media today thing that makes
everything better
i'm doing that just to mess with people
who are listening to this at 1.5 speed
i sound like a chipmunk don't i this is
called the simultaneous sip and it's
going to make everything better
if you don't believe it well i feel
sorry for
you go
have you heard of how mushrooms
are actually connected to each other
under the ground
and this great sort of psilocybin
mushroom connection they can all they
can all talk and connect under the
ground
well that's exactly like the
simultaneous sip
there's your analogy for the day
all right let's talk about some things
uh representative eric swalwell
uh he's been put back on the homeland
security committee
which is exactly what you want to do
with your representatives that you are
concerned
may have been influenced by china you
put them right on the homeland security
committee
now uh i
i rushed to tell you that there is no
proof
that representative swalwell is
influenced in any way
by china there is no proof of that that
i am aware of whatsoever
in other news swalwell compared trump to
bin laden and said that he is likewise
radicalizing his followers
so i tell you again that there is no
proof that i'm aware of
that representative swalwell is in any
way
influenced by china it is simply a
coincidence
that he acts exactly like he is
you get that right it's not causation
it's just coincidence
so um in other news um
julian assange is uh i don't know if
she's current or ex-girlfriend
uh pamela anderson is making a
big push to get assange pardoned
and when i was looking at the story
about pamela anderson i said to myself
she has two good points
moving on um there's a you may have seen
on the internet there's an anti-lockdown
study it's a study that says
that maybe the lockdowns were not
effective you like that don't you
don't you love the fact that there's a
study
that says the lockdowns were not
effective
don't you love that well i loved it too
until i read that the study was
so i'm going to start a new thing i
guess in a way i've already started it
but i'm going to be a little bit more
dedicated to it which is i'm going to
recommend
people to you who are unusually unbiased
and also unusually good at sorting
things out for you
now one of them i talk about all the
time is andres backhouse
probably the best the best on twitter
that i've seen
in terms of looking at papers and
studies and data
and telling you what's obviously wrong
with them
so if you don't have his voice in the
back of your head
telling you that everything you're
seeing on the internet is and
why yeah with
high credibility uh you don't really
know what's going on
i i feel like you need at least that
protection
of that little voice in your head the
other person i
um that i recommended i'll talk about a
little bit
but so two recommendations today andreas
back house is one
so the study about the lockdowns not
being
uh you know not being effective
you should treat that with a credibility
of zero
zero you should treat it like it didn't
even happen that that's the amount of
credibility to give it
all right um
i made the mistake yesterday in the car
because some commercials came on on
whatever i was listening to
and i thought to myself i'm just gonna
sample some other stuff
now usually when i'm sampling the ideas
on the left
i go to cnn because i feel like they're
a good
they capture you know that left-leaning
kind of bias quite well but every now
and then i go a little bit
further and i go all the way to msnbc
and i turned on msnbc and my god it's
just frightening
now i to be to be fair
it's probably exactly how their audience
feels when they
log on to fox news accidentally or they
they visit their uncle and it's on the
tv they probably stand there going
what what the hell am i seeing
well that was my experience watching
msnbc
so there was a serious conversation and
this is the part that's mind-blowing
that this was serious
about how to punish all of the trump
supporters
after he's out of office that's actually
being discussed
like it's totally normal totally routine
it's just something you talk about on
the news yeah let's talk about punishing
one of the political parties
for who they supported
that is that's a a type of evil
that's so palpable and so like you can
feel the evil but they don't
they don't to them it's just talking
and it's it's just mind-blowing to
actually go over there it's like you've
you've entered another reality or you're
on another planet or something
where you can talk about that like it's
just a normal conversation
punishing your political enemies
it's mind-blowing really um
but the question i wonder is how do they
think that ends
like what what's the end point of
making it a precedent or making it a big
thing
to go after and punish the political
party that you feel really really was
bad
and i'm not even talking about the
leaders i'm talking about the voters and
the people who just took jobs in the
administration
did you want a president trump with
nobody taking jobs
did you want that was that your better
your better solution is that trump gets
elected and then he can't hire anybody
because if he does they'll their lives
will be ruined in the future
is that what you want it's sort of like
the dog chasing the car
so msnbc suppose you get your way
suppose you get everything you want and
every trump supporter
is punished in the way that they can
really feel
what did he get what did he get into
that
revenge justice
did you make it a better world i don't
think so
and when i listen to it i just think is
there some
inability to think things through to to
what kind of effect that would have on
the whole system
to make it somehow normalized that you
punish
the voters the voters who voted wrong
get punished the people who just took
jobs in the administration
because you still have to run the
government you still have to have a
secretary of this and that right
it's shocking
and of course you know don lemon said
some similar things in the sense that
he was saying the other day that there
are too many members of the klan
support trump so if you also support
trump you're basically in the clan
you know by association now i would like
to see
if we had an actual news industry you
know people
who work in this thing called the news
who would ask
important questions and stuff like that
if we had anything like that
here's what i'd like to see we and we
don't unfortunately
i'd like the news industry to ask every
prominent democratic
politician if they agree with don lemon
just get him on record don lemon says
that if there's some bad people in the
group
and let's say they're in the clan and
there are members of the republican
party
that the republican party is now
basically associated with
and therefore can be considered almost
as bad as the klan by association
that's the don lemon belief i would like
to see every democratic leader
ask that question for the record do you
do you disavow this or do you
embrace that opinion don't you
um oh that's interesting somebody says
there's no twitter
simulcast there is a uh there might be a
setting that i didn't hear
uh hit i had some system trouble anyway
just go over to
um go over to
youtube if you want to if you want to
see it all right
um
so given that
the the don lemon thing which is the
idea that if you're
um if if you're in a group
and you're a bad person then the entire
group
is defined by that the bad people in the
group
so that's what the mainstream narrative
is telling us
that all republicans are bad because
some are bad
all republicans are bad because some of
them attacked the capital
now what do you do about that
because the wokeness idea has gone from
hey
you individual you did some bad things
you individual
it's now spread all the way to if any
individuals
do something you're all the same
individual
that's what it's become and so i came up
with a linguistic
kill shot a linguistic kill shot is
something that
once you hear it it's kind of the end of
the conversation
the first one that you might have been
aware of was when then candidate trump
referred to bush
as low energy that was a linguistic kill
shot
as soon as bush was seen as low energy
you couldn't ever see it any other way
that's it it was the end of it so that's
what makes it a kill shot
is that once you've heard it you don't
have anything else to say
you just have to walk away at that point
so
in our wokeness situation where an
entire group is being branded by the
reputations of the few
in the group here is my linguistic kill
shot
and i'll tell you why it works after i
tell you and it goes like this
i tweeted this this morning if you think
a group
if you think a group of people can be
fairly defined
by the worst person in the group the
worst person in your group
is you
i'll read it again and i'll tell you why
it's a kill shot
if you think if you think a group of
people can be fairly defined by the
worst
person in the group the worst person in
your group
is you that's the end of the
conversation
now you can't do that with a lot of
topics i think there are a lot of topics
for which there is no linguistic kill
shot
but now use your imagination and you're
watching let's say a cnn segment
in which somebody's saying something
similar to what
don lemon says which is all republicans
or all voters for trump have to
answer to the worst people in the group
and then you imagine that
the person let's say it's a trump
supporter
just says this one bumper sticker saying
that if you think
a group can be defined by its worst
member
the worst member of your group is you
would there be any more conversation
there wouldn't be anything left to say
because
when you hear that it sounds really true
doesn't it
doesn't it it sounds true it's like oh
yeah
somebody who would tar an entire group
by the reputation of the few
what do we call them is there any name
for that
what's a what's a name for somebody who
thinks
that a few people in a group define the
whole
would it be racists
oh yeah racist would it be
sexist yeah yeah would it be
bigot it would be would it be
worthless piece of it would be
and so i recommend this linguistic kill
shot to you
every time you hear somebody saying that
they're defining the group
by a small number of bad people
just break this out now why does it work
what what is the engineering of it that
makes this work
whereas any number of a million
different things you could say
do not work number one calling somebody
a hypocrite
has no persuasive value
in the history of the world nobody's
ever won an argument
or changed anything because they pointed
out correctly
that some hypocrisy was happening it's
just
useless now it's useful for
entertainment
it's useful for context it's useful for
educating yourself so the the
accusations of hypocrisy
they have some value in in terms of
rounding out the picture
but they're not going to change anything
do you know what can change the world a
good
bumper sticker i hate to say it
but it's true if you tell somebody a
complicated argument that's
excellent you say hey bob
here's a complicated argument but it's
really solid
it's complicated but it's solid why
don't you take this solid complicated
argument and see if you can change the
world with it
good luck bob because solid
complicated arguments don't change
anything they don't
because nobody understands them they
can't repeat them they don't
they don't feel them you know they'll
feel it in their body
but you turn something into a sentence
or yeah in this case it's exactly one
sentence
you make it one sentence you make one
point
and you make that point a good one and
it has the
it has the same power as a rhyme you
remember
um when oj was on trial
and one of the defense tricks which is a
real good hypnosis trick is to rhyme
the defense if the glove does not fit
you must acquit
if the glove does not fit you must
acquit
years later do you all remember that
saying
if the glove doesn't fit you must have
quit it's the one thing you remember
that's how good johnny cochran was if
you're wondering like you know who are
the
like best hypnotists in the world
or persuaders let's say johnny cochran
johnny cochran really really good
so just understand
that if you can simplify to a sentence
and the sentence has some power
that the bumper sticker version is way
more persuasive
way more persuasive than any complicated
excellent argument
so there is your kill shot you should be
able to
if if this were repeated as the normal
response over and over every time
somebody goes all don lemon on you uh
you would eventually be able to wipe it
out
this is a kill shot it would end that
problem
all right um
here's uh something i shouldn't say out
loud
but watch me do it anyway you know
the the weird thing about uh let's say
any uh
pressure on freedom of speech no matter
where that pressure comes from
either the government pressure which is
the you know the official freedom of
speech
thing or private industry with their
censoring that's good for the private
industry maybe not so good
in your opinion for you and then of
course individuals and
social media and what they say about you
so there are a lot of pressures on
freedom of speech and i've never felt
them more strongly than i feel them
today
i feel that the the
[Music]
the field of things i can even say out
loud
is just sort of shrinking every day
so i'm gonna uh i'm gonna say something
out loud
that could get me canceled so this might
be the last time you see me
and i don't know if that's true or not
like i couldn't put a
i couldn't put some odds on this what
are the odds that the next thing i say
will be the last thing you ever hear
from me
it's pretty good if i had to put let me
put an odds on it
20 probably there's a 20
chance that after today you'll never
hear from me again
just think about that i'm going to tell
you something that is
honest and useful
good context nothing about it is
wrong i mean in the sense that opinions
can't be wrong
i'll show you my work there won't be any
facts that are in question
and i'm just going to say this thing out
loud and i feel as if
i don't you there's no way to calculate
it of course but i feel as if there's
about a 20
chance that you'll i'll never be able to
speak in public again
after i say this think about that
think about what that does to the
conversation and
believe me the thing i'm going to say i
don't think there's anything wrong with
it
i'm not aware there's no hate involved
in it
i'm not inciting anything it's gonna
sound like i am though
so i'm gonna so i'm gonna be in trump
territory
where i'm gonna tell you directly i
don't want any violence
that's as direct as you can be i don't
want any violence
don't want anybody to act on anything
i'm going to say
so nothing should be construed as
inciting
but you know it doesn't work that way
right if anybody says but you are
inciting
it doesn't matter that i told you i'm
not all right
it won't matter that my intentions are
different from what i'm being accused of
because the accusation will be the
important thing
you ready for it is that enough of a
build up
all right here we go
while i completely disavow
the capital assault i disavow the
violence i disavow
100 entering that building i disavow
uh everything about the bad parts of
that
everything complete 100 disavowal
that's the that's the first part here's
the second part
i think it helped i think it made us
safer
why we watched for a year
and it appeared that the left was
willing to get violent
and get to the streets and actually
control territory
literally conquer territory and there
was no response
no response from the police at least not
enough to stop it
not enough response for the politicians
i didn't see the politicians
doing enough to stop it in fact they
encouraged it
at least the democrats um
so what was going to happen if that can
if that situation continued
what would have been the most
predictable outcome
of people on the left being able to get
away with rioting and violence and
breaking things
on a massive scale while people on the
right
did not and whatever whatever happened
to them
however bad they thought it was they
just stayed home
what happens if that just keeps going
now i don't believe in a lot of slippery
slopes that don't have a
logical connection to them but some
things have logical connections and in
those cases you can predict it'll go
and one logical connection in this case
is that anything that works people are
going to do more of it right
and if something doesn't work you'd
expect to do less of it
if there's more friction on something
they'll probably do less of it
if you remove friction from something
probably be more of it
you don't need the slippery slope to
describe what's obvious
people follow incentives
every time incentives always work so
what would have been our world
if the left could do violence without
without any pushback because the police
gave up
let's just be honest the police the
police kind of gave up
now it wasn't their fault on pro police
completely
but i don't think they had to support
that it made even sense that they could
do much about
what it was that was their job you know
it was their job to stop this stuff but
i don't think they had the support
so you can't blame the police all right
you blame the leadership
so what is
what is the logical outcome that i would
not have asked for
i certainly would not have asked anybody
to go to the capitol and get in that
building
absolutely not but it happened
so once it happened you can talk about
it and
i think that we came out ahead
now when i say we came out ahead i have
to be really careful about this
five people got killed a whole bunch of
people got injured
there are lots of bad bad bad bad things
that came out of this
people's lives will be destroyed
the trump supporters are being vilified
a lot of bad stuff
right so if you're adult enough to work
with me on this
we can accept that the bad stuff is just
as bad as everybody thinks it is
and don't minimize it nobody's
minimizing it
still i think we came out ahead
even with five dead and many injured and
all the trouble it caused
here's why this is the first time
that the left realized there was a
counter force
that's it that's the whole argument it's
the first time
that the left realized they can't go
much further
without risking a counter force and the
counter force was
pretty impressive i disavow it
no violence no way
i i'm a hundred percent opposed and not
i'm not i'm even opposed to the
trespassing
you know much less the breaking of
windows and stuff of course i'm opposed
to all that
but it's just a fact that what the left
watched scared the out of them
right if you were on the left and you
watched that
that was the first time you realized
there was a counter force
because the the right doesn't doesn't
act the same way
um i have this personality quirk
which i think may may be somewhat common
on the right
maybe less common on the left and i
always warn people about it in my
personal life
i tell people that
there's an aspect of my personality that
i'm not proud of
but i need to warn you about it which is
that i'm perfectly flexible
until i'm not
that it's just a personality quirk i am
so
flexible i'm okay with that yeah that's
not good for me that's fine
i'm flexible i'll bend over i'll take a
little extra
you don't have to meet me halfway i'll
go 75 you go 25 i'm cool with that
i'm the most flexible guy you'll ever
find in your life
until i'm not
and one of the the trade-offs
for being the most flexible guy in the
world
is that when i'm not i'm really not
i don't take not flexible
as uh hyperbole
when i decide to be not flexible i'm
going all the way
all right to you know to the wall
no no deviation no hesitation
nothing will stop me there's a brick
wall in the way i will tear it apart
with my teeth
but until i'm ready to do that i'm
flexible
now i say this with like getting into
any kind of a physical
altercation if you if you've lived life
as a
male person you know that you're
it's just in the environment if you're
male you're often getting into
situations that could turn violent
because you're with other men and things
can escalate and it's just a normal part
of life
i you know women have their own
dangerous situations with men
but if you're a man you're somewhat
continuously getting into this
am i gonna have a fight now or is this
traffic situation gonna turn into
bloodshed
right it's a male life if you're a woman
you have no idea what i'm talking about
right now
could the men who were on here give me a
confirmation so that the women who are
watching
see that i'm not making something up
this crazy if you're male
you are continuously in a potentially
violent situation
yeah see the yeses so the men are the
men are confirming this
men are dangerous duh
you know we do the wars we do the crimes
for the most part
men are dangerous we are really
dangerous
but you haven't seen dangerous until
you've seen me
stop being flexible and
i feel as though the republican party
has a little bit of that quality to it
wouldn't you say pretty flexible
pretty flexible until they're not
and i feel as though the capital assault
which i disavow completely
no violence no way i do not approve of
any of that
but there was an education involved in
it
wasn't there the left just learned
something they didn't know
which is if you turn this thing on again
we don't know what the is going to
happen
so maybe you shouldn't turn that on
again
now the way it's going to go is that the
people who did the
capital assault will be the ones who are
blamed
trump will take his share of blame and i
agree with that by the way because i
think he could have stopped it he should
have done more
um i think his supporters will take some
blame should we
sure sure if somebody wants to say scott
you're a little bit to blame
for trump existing as president and
therefore
his decisions if you'd like to make that
case i'll say
okay as long as we're consistent you
know you're also to blame for biden
but i don't think you should be punished
right you could be blamed
for voting for the wrong person
supporting the wrong person that's fair
but could you also give me credit for
let's say
more peace in the middle east i'll take
the blame
for the things he did wrong in your
opinion
if you'll let me accept that i thought
he would do some big things that would
be lasting and he did
in my opinion so
here's my bottom line on that i
disavow violence in all of its forms but
i think the left
just learned that the right can summon
a lot of people with guns really quickly
and if you're telling me that doesn't
change the balance of power in this
country i think you're wrong
i think the left now has an
understanding
that they don't have a free pass forever
what they do have is a republican party
that's really flexible
really really flexible until it isn't
so next topic um you're
you're probably watching as i am the
story of this fellow john sullivan
who has been associated with black lives
matter but he was also
part of the capital uh assault and he
his he he's i guess he was doing a
documentary he was filming it
but he was also caught on tape actively
involved in you know incitement while he
was there
now the interesting part about this is
that uh
there's some pushback because the c
apparently the local black lives matter
uh people didn't like him either so
there he was sort of
kicked out of black lives matter which i
don't really understand
because there's no actual formal way to
be in it
versus out of it i think to be a member
of black lives matter don't you just say
have to say you are how do you get
kicked out of your belief
because black lives matter is more of
the belief right
the people marching on the street don't
have you know their names in a book
as i'm a member of this organization
with a name tag or anything it's just
you just have to say you're in it you're
in it so apparently
that wasn't good enough for john
sullivan
because he apparently he said he was in
it but black lives matter said no you're
not
get out of here you troublemaker they
said
but what does don lemon say about this
what's the don lemon take
if he was a member of black lives matter
but black lives matter
at least some number of them didn't want
him in there
does that matter because he's in there
if he thinks he's in black lives matter
then he's in it that's all it requires
you just have to think you're in it
so wouldn't the don lemon
theory apply that therefore black lives
matter has to take
responsibility for the assault on the
capital
this stupid right it would be completely
stupid
to say that that black lives matter is
responsible for the
assault on the capital because a few
members
in this one group were also black lives
matter it would be stupid
but that's the don lemon theory that
we're all
we're all tainted by our associations
uh speaking of tainted by associations
um you know the lincoln project is uh
having a good old time because they they
believe they succeeded
one of their members has been accused of
sexual
improprieties and i think they took his
name off of their co-founding uh
website so here's the thing
again applying the same standard um i
have no
i have no proof or evidence that this
one individual
who is the founder of lincoln project i
won't even say his name because there
are allegations right
um he's only alleged
to have had these sexual improprieties
just
allegations i have no proof you know how
would i how would i have any proof
but um could we say would it be fair to
say
that one of the co-founders of the
lincoln project
was a sexual offender allegedly
allegedly a sexual offender
would it be fair to say that all the
rest of them
are also alleged sexual offenders
because if one prominent member is and
remember he was a co-founder
he wasn't just somebody who says hey i'm
associated with you
co-founder if a co-founder is a sexual
offender
allegedly doesn't that mean they all are
now of course the answer is no no it
doesn't work like that
the fact that every member of the
lincoln project
looks like a sex offender doesn't mean
they are
the fact that their stupid little beards
make them look exactly like sex
offenders
that is not indication that they are and
i don't want you to think that they are
looking exactly like one and having one
of your prominent members
be accused of being one doesn't make you
one
it just makes you somebody who looks
exactly like one
i don't know they have that vibe but i
don't think you should take that
to mean more than it does because you
know people can look
guilty by and be innocent people can
look innocent and be guilty you're not
really good at telling
so the fact that the lincoln project
people look exactly like sex offenders
that doesn't mean anything there's
there's no evidence that any of them are
involved
in any of that well no proof yeah
but there's no proof let me be more
specific
no court has ever confirmed
that the lincoln project are mostly made
up of sex offenders
and therefore i think you can conclude
that they're not
are we clear okay
so there's a great piece of writing
by a guy named reed berkowitz that i
tweeted this morning and i recommend it
and uh what he's talking about is
uh hugh he's he's a game designer
by trade so somebody who's a game
designer
and not i'm not talking about just a
programmer
but a game designer somebody who
understands the
the psychology of a game and the rewards
and
why some games work and some don't the x
factor of
what makes it sticky all that stuff so
he's an expert on all that stuff
and he writes about q as if it were a
designed
game because q has all of the elements
as he describes it as
a great piece of writing of a
well-designed game
so a poorly designed game might just
tell you
something is true but a well-designed
game will keep your curiosity
and your independent thinking intact and
say here's a hint
figure out what it means and if you give
people hints
and tell them to figure out what it
means it really engages them
so you'll see a better job of explaining
the the gaming of the game psychology
that is either coincidentally or
intentionally
we don't know but at least it exists in
the q
and on situation and if you're trying to
understand
why it is that so many people could buy
into something that
perhaps some of you are saying i don't
believe any of that's true
if you're wondering how people could buy
into it this explains it
it's explained because the psychology of
how q
evolved either coincidentally
maybe intentionally i don't know maybe
intentionally
mimics the exact psychological hooks
that a good game would have now
uh it's worth reading the whole piece
for a couple of reasons
number one uh reed berkowitz i don't
know who he is except
a game designer he's an extraordinary
extraordinarily good
writer so the second reason to read this
is just to read these sentences
read how short and clear his sentences
are
and you can you can absorb a fairly long
piece
like it wasn't long it's wait do you why
do you check it out
because the way he writes in such
bite-sized
clear direct sentences is just it's just
a pleasure
you actually feel good as you're reading
it because it because he takes all the
friction out of the writing
i've been looking at a number of things
this week where the writers were
terrible
they were smart and they knew what they
were talking about but they were
terrible writers
and you you could feel your brain
overheat
just trying to read the sentences
because they're too complicated
but then you read read berkowitz's
sentence and you go
ah this is what writing is supposed to
be
where i'm just feeling the ideas and i
don't feel any friction
in the way they're described it's really
good
yeah i see my cat behind me all right
let's see what else is going on here uh
the justice department
walked back their claim that the capital
rioters wanted to quote capture and
assassinate elected officials
now there was chanting to that effect
but my guess is that had more to do with
crowds getting worked up and somebody
else has it and then they chant it
i would be i'm inclined to agree with
the justice department based on just
what we've seen
that there doesn't seem to be that
intention
there definitely were a few people
chanting it and talking that way
but if you're looking at the crowd in
general
i'm trying to imagine a situation where
let's say somebody in the crowd got a
hold of
let's just say mike pence like
physically got
a hold of him during the capital assault
what would the
other protesters have done would they
have said yeah
we got mike pence i don't think so
i feel as if a a fight would have broken
out within the
assaulter group with the people who said
that's crazy let mike pence go we're
just here for our free speech
i think it would have been a slaughter i
think the people who said let mike pence
go even though we're mad at him
would have outnumbered anybody who was
chanting let's get him
i don't think it would have been close
no way to know and it's a remember it's
a mob
so you can't predict anything right the
mob is unpredictable
but my my feeling of it is that the
claim that the crowd was there to do
that
uh is not that case is not made
i think i think there's a far stronger
case
that most people did not intend that and
if they'd seen that going down i think
they would have stopped it
i think they would have stopped it just
my belief
all right here are some
questions that i have on the election
integrity
and i put these on twitter in a thread
so that people could respond
now these are the questions that if they
were answered to my satisfaction
and i think they could be by the way
that's the beauty of them i ask
questions that i think can be answered
by people who have the right information
so there are questions remaining on the
integrity of the election system
but i'm not going to get into any
allegations
you know their long list of allegations
but separate from the specific
allegations
i have general questions about how uh
how good the integrity of the security
is for a system
and here they are and if these were
answered i would walk away and say
all right i'm happy i feel as though my
questions have been answered
question number one has there ever been
a large scale
and each of these just hear the word
large scale
with each of these i'm not i'm not
concerned with the onesies and twosies
and somebody's dead uncle voted i'm
talking about
large-scale things that could change in
national election
has there ever been a large-scale
election fraud that was discovered
by chance here's why this is
important somebody says this guy has a
big ego
well welcome new person
there's a lot of context to that that
you don't have but i'll accept that
comment
so the reason this question is important
is has there ever been
a large-scale election fraud that was
discovered by chance
it would indicate that you could do a
large-scale
fraud and you might have gotten away
with it
but it was discovered by chance
wouldn't you like to know that and if so
is the type of fraud that got discovered
by chance if it exists
does that opportunity still exist
so wouldn't you like to know just as
context
have there ever been unless a recent-ish
because the
you know how the voting is done has
changed over time but are there any
recent examples
where somebody did try a large-scale
fraud
and only by luck it was discovered
wouldn't you like to know that because
suppose the answer is no
wouldn't that mean a lot if you told me
that nobody's
ever gotten away with a large-scale
fraud
that would mean something to me now it's
not the whole story
but it begins to put a bigger better
picture together all right here's the
next question
um could a hacker who had god access
meaning they got into your software and
they can change anything
that would be like an administrator
access type could a hacker with god
access
change a national election result in a
big way
that would be undetectable via recount
or audit in other words
is it even a thing
is the system designed in a way that as
long as you do a recount and you do an
audit you'll catch
everything do you know the answer to
that
because i don't i don't know the answer
that
and one of the people who responded to
this
is one of the ones i'm going to
recommend that you follow christopher
hill
you'll see him in my twitter feed toward
the top he's a co-owner of three guys
game studio and
when it comes to software development
type questions he's a really clear
thinker
so i recommend that you follow him the
reason i'm recommending these people who
are independent
and clear thinkers is because you need
something to protect you from the news
the news
is not trying to be news the way it used
to if it ever did
you need some independent people who
have a long track record
of not being on a side just looking at
the
logic of a situation so andreas
backhouse is one for looking at data
for looking at software related
questions i would recommend christopher
hill
and here's what he said um
if i didn't expect precincts to compare
the cumulative totals
amongst one another in other words
my precinct can't check with yours and
yours can't check with mine
but everybody can check their own so as
long as the only thing you could check
is your own numbers could you come up
with a way
with software with a god-like hack in
which nobody would know that you cheated
and here is a software developer's
answer to that and this one scared me
because there are so many ways to cheat
anything
that when you hear a new way that you've
never heard before
you're like i actually have goose bumps
like literally goosebumps now
from just even this thought so let's say
you're one of the precincts and you want
to check
the system to see if your votes were
recorded correctly
so you know that you have exactly let's
say
a hundred thousand and three votes so
you want to check the final tally to see
if those votes were recorded correctly
so you go in and it says yes
it matches and then you log off
and then the number changes back to the
wrong one
but then you want to double check so you
log back on
and when your logon is detected the
system knows you're from that precinct
and it changes the number back to what
you wanted to see
and then you log off and it changes it
back to the fake number
how would you know how would you know
now is something like this ever been
done
yup i've done it
when i had a uh problem with a uh
stalker
so on my website dilbert.com once uh
there's a stalker that i i get every few
years she comes off her meds
and she'll write hundreds of comments
on at the time it was on my blog post
and she would write so many
just hundreds and hundreds of comments
every day
hundreds every day and they're long ones
and they're crazy
and they they accuse me of things right
they accused me of
sex crimes and stuff and keep in mind
it's somebody i've never met
doesn't even live in this country right
so
we tried to discourage it and we just
could we i tried blocking
but she would just sign up with a new
account every day
and finally the tech people came up with
this idea
they said we know her ip address
i guess it's always the same in her case
so we'll make it look when she signs on
that all of her comments are showing up
but anybody else who logs on won't be
able to see them
so we created a situation where the
stalker would log onto my website every
day
write hundreds of comments that she
believed
everybody could see but they couldn't
she was the only one who could see her
own comments
and the problem went away so
that's precedent of the only person who
doesn't see the system right
is the person that you've designated you
can't see it right when they log on
the system changes to to just show them
what they show
now you could still catch this problem
if there were two
two precincts who said hey let's get
together you know and
and compare notes and add them up and
you know there would be a way to catch
it
but would the normal system catch it
it's not enough that it could be caught
you also have to know that the system
does that thing that catches it
i don't know that that's the case is
there a part of the process
where somebody looks at each precinct
and checks their numbers to the end
point and
i don't know maybe maybe there is
but these are the questions i ask all
right so
so that is one suggestion of how if you
had got access to the software you could
have changed it
but probably other people would have to
be in on it i think so i'm not even sure
you could get away with that
how about this here's another question
would selective recounts and audits
the type that are requested by the
losing side be sufficient
to detect fraud that could be spread
across
multiple precincts so let's say you had
a fraud that was a little bit here a
little bit there a little bit there
so that if you were if you found it in
any one precinct you wouldn't find
enough to change the election
um in that situation
would you be able to detect that if you
said hey let's do a recount or an audit
in
this place and this place
what are your odds what are your odds
that an audit and a recount can find
all of the problems or could they only
find
some kinds of problems do you know
i don't know why is it that we've gotten
to this point
and i can't answer the question would an
audit
plus a recount find all of the problems
or only some types of problems why don't
i know the answer to that question
it's like the most basic thing if
if our experts had told us from the
beginning
oh i know you have these fraud
allegations
but let me assure you that every type of
fraud that could happen
would always be caught with these two
simple methods
you do a recount and then you
selectively
um you know you pick things to look at
just to make sure that the votes are
are real too do you know the answer to
that question
with those two simple steps recounting
plus auditing which goes further than
recounting
would those find all the problems
is there any kind of a problem that
wouldn't be detected by that
now i think that there's two sets of
problems that you should think of
one is the any kind of irregularity that
might happen at the point of voting
right things that happen around the
voting machines
and around the local counting machines
and the local ballots
but then all of that stuff gets summed
up and sent electronically
to some larger database obviously so
that they can get the total
is there is there a difference in how
secure we are
at that first part the counting of the
ballots the local stuff
are we just as secure after it leaves
the local area
and becomes part of a larger database in
the sky somewhere i don't know
do you know or is that second part of
the system
designed so well that even if you hacked
it would be immediately
discoverable beats me
do you know i have no idea
i i couldn't tell you if it's zero
percent
um hackable or a hundred percent
no idea and why don't i know that
that's a problem right it's because we
don't have a useful
news organization because everything i'm
going to ask are things you should know
already
but you don't here's another one uh on a
scale of
one to a hundred percent if you were to
talk to let's say an expert somebody
really understood the election systems
state to state
you'd have to know more than one state
um if you ask somebody like that
on a scale of one to a hundred percent
how secure are our state election
systems
at least secure in terms of the big
frauds not small stuff
what do you think an expert would say
and why don't i know the answer to that
question
would somebody who really really
understands the systems
say you know scott i gotta tell you
you know forget about this specific
election
there's no way anybody could cheat it's
like 99
secure is that what they would say
or would they say yeah i think we're 90
secure is 90 secure
if somebody said uh your
your bank account is 90 secure
would you put your money in a bank that
only said it's 90 secure
i'd love to know what an expert would
say about that um
here's another one have elections ever
been rigged
and when i say ever let's say last 20
years
keep it local have elections ever been
rigged in ways that election officials
had never contemplated until they
discovered it
has that ever happened has has anybody
ever rigged an election
using a technique that nobody even
thought was a technique
until it was discovered because if
that's
ever happened what would stop it from
happening again
right if it's ever happened you can't
there's not a logical way that you can
rule it out from happening again
it would make you say i feel like it
could happen again
take a let's take any microsoft software
that's released
we'll just use microsoft as an example
when
when microsoft puts out a new operating
system new
version of windows do you think that
it is a hundred percent unhackable
or some other percentage well i think
if you've lived in the real world you
know that even microsoft
attracting the best you know the best
minds and programmers in the world
continually are surprised that somebody
found a new way to hack them
even though they didn't think there was
anyway how often does that happen
isn't it 100 has there ever been a
new version of windows i don't know the
answer to this actually has there ever
been a new version of windows
that didn't get hacked pretty soon one
way
or another i don't know that it's ever
happened
so if the best programmers in the world
can't foresee
what a hacker might come up with why
would that be the case with the election
systems
why would the election system be better
architected than windows
i mean i realize there might be a
complexity difference too
but i don't know the answer to this
question either about has it ever
happened
all right and here's another one have
election
experts and i'm talking only about
experts
seen any red flags for widespread fraud
in this election now a red flag doesn't
mean
that they can prove it happened but if
you are an election
expert and you're just sort of taking
the big picture and you're just looking
down at it and seeing
the claimed anomalies the vote count
anything really if you were an expert
looking at it
did it look like a fair election and
would all the experts agree
if you had 100 experts and they all
looked at it would they all say
yeah that was fair given what i know
about how easy it is to detect
fraud you can assume that's fair
would they all say that every expert
or would some of the experts say yeah
you can't tell
probably fair might be fair
but there's no way you can tell and i
have to admit there are a few red flags
there that i'd look into a little bit
closer
i don't know so these are some big
questions that don't depend on any
specific allegations
these are things that american voters
should understand about their voting
system
we should understand is it vulnerable
and i don't know that we've seen enough
opinions on that all right
so that is what we've done today
we have created a linguistic kill shot
to destroy at least part of creeping
wokeness not all of it but it might help
we have designed a new system to give us
some
second let's say a second opinion to the
fake news and that new new system is the
independent thinkers
some of whom i mentioned today and if
you compile
on your twitter feed you just keep
adding the independent thinkers
you're going to get a different view of
the world so i feel as if
the independent thinkers are the key
to making things work all right
um that's all i've got
today yeah i hear a lot about blockchain
for voting and i don't disagree with
that but i think i'd have to be
much more of an expert to know if that
creates any new problems
as opposed to solving the old ones
all right i'm just looking at your
comments for a moment
oh how about that buffinia yeah
apophenia is
uh i'm sorry i put that in the title of
the live stream and then i didn't talk
about it
um when i talked about the game designer
reed berkowitz his article he mentions a
word apophenia
and it's the seeing patterns where they
don't exist
so the q anon people would see they
thought they would see patterns
but it's just because your brain sees
patterns where they don't exist
that's all so that there's a word for it
i guess um did i
read peter navarro's election fraud
report yeah i read peter navarro's fraud
report
on the same document as the debunks for
them so if you haven't seen the debunk
for the peter navarra specific stuff
you should see them together now suppose
you've seen peter navarro's claims
and you've seen somebody saying that
they're debunking them
what do you know what have you learned
nothing nothing those two things by
themselves don't have any
any value at all except to tell you
where to look into more i guess
but if anybody brings you an argument
says here's my claim
and then here's the counter claim you
don't know anything
because you need to hear the response to
the counter claim
and then another response to that and
another response to that
let me put it this way each iteration
gives you more comfort if you're smart
and you're looking at something
so the first event would be a claim of
anything whatever the claim is
a credibility of a claim in our world
should be zero
it doesn't even matter who says it could
be the pope
the the credibility of any claim
is zero even if it's true you don't know
so it's zero credibility
a counter claim to the claim gives you
no more comfort than the claim itself
right you might think it does but until
you've heard the response
to the counter claim you don't really
know if the counter claim is true either
so what if you hear the response to the
response to the response to the response
well
if they're staying on topic instead of
doing like in the real world where one
of them goes off onto another point or
moves the goal post or something
but if they stayed on topic then each
iteration of
challenging a point or a counterpoint
would get you closer to some kind of
knowledge
but the first claim and the first
counter claim
is zero value and you should look at it
that way
all right um
[Music]
should there be a death sentence for the
q guy
well uh i don't know that
it's a good that's a good question
i i don't think there should be the
death sentence for the q guy
but the larger question is did q
directly cause the the violence
there were lots of causes if you took
any of them away
it probably wouldn't have happened if q
didn't exist
would there have been the assault on the
capital probably not
if trump didn't exist probably not
lots of things had to exist for that to
happen if the fake news
had not been who they were would the
assault on the capitol have happened
probably not
because the news would have said the
election was fair and people would have
said oh that news is dependable
i guess it was fair so you would have to
you'd have to remove a lot of stuff to
or i let me put it this way a lot of
things had to be just the way they were
for this situation to happen but the
fake news is at the top of the list
if you didn't have fake news you
wouldn't have had the capital assault
and the the great thing about the fake
news great thing which is a terrible
thing
is that the fake news can cause an
insurrection
which they call it i don't call it that
but
they can cause this problem and then
they can
they can assign the blame to somebody
else
and that's what happened so the fake
news caused riots
and then the fake news assigned the
blame to the riots to trump
and they're going to use it to impeach
him that's happening right in front of
you
it's shocking not to say that trump
doesn't have responsibility because i
think he does
all right um
yeah you know all the references to the
reichtag fire
i just find ridiculous here and
i've said it before but i'll say it
again here are the things that you
should compare to the holocaust
nothing here are things that you should
compare to trump
to uh to hitler nothing
here's what you should compare to you
know
the whole nazi experience nothing
the whole reason that that's uh in our
minds as the
the biggest sort of thing is because it
was different
if it was like everything else and and
sort of predicted how things go
you'd see a lot more of it but the
reason that it exists
sort of in its special place in evil
history is because it's not likely
it's very unlikely to happen
yeah and even if you take the other
holocaust the pole pots the stalins the
mouse
um they are their own situations the the
things in common is lots of people died
but they are
different situations all right that's
all for now i'll talk to you later
bye
