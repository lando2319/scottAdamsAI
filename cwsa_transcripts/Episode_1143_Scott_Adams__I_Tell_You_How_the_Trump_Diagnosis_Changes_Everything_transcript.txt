hey everybody
come on in come on in it's another great
morning featuring coffee with scott
adams the best part of the day
does it get better than this i don't
think so
well today i'm doing a little experiment
in which i am
live streaming simultaneously from
two devices i've got one device uh
live streaming to youtube and
one live streaming two periscope per
normal just an experiment i don't know
if i'll do it again
but before we get to the news
what do we need that's right it's uh
it's time for the simultaneous sip and
all you need is a copper mug or glass
attacker towels for sign the canteen
choker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and you're about to
enjoy it
now go
i feel my live stream audience is ten
percent better
just because of that sip right there
that's called science
well let's see what's going on um
certainly it seems that the vice
presidential uh
debate might take on a little bit
extra importance but you know what's
interesting about the vice presidential
debate
is that pretty much nobody in the world
wants either of those two people to be
president
so we're in this weird 2020 situation
where we're saying you know it might not
be biden so much maybe
kamala harris is the important one in
this race
meanwhile president trump is in the
hospital so people are saying well
you know we don't want this to happen
but we got to be serious about a
vice presidential option how did we get
to the point
where we spent yeah the the most
powerful and capable country of all time
the united states spent two years
scouring the country to find the two
best candidates for the two parties and
when we were done
we ended up with two candidates
that probably couldn't win a mayor's
race at this point
well that's not true both of them could
you know they could both be
uh in congress for sure but
i exaggerate the point being i'm not
sure
anybody wants really to see a
president kamel harris or a president
depends
but maybe that's what we're talking
about now
so we'll see how that goes um
i just read that the nobel peace prize
there's of course a betting market so
people are trying to bet
who will win and two of the entities
that are near the top of the betting
list for the nobel peace prize
are the world health organization not
not even joking
that this is really happening in the
actual reality world
if there is reality the world health
organization
is being considered for the nobel prize
at least according to the betting
markets the other one's even better
black lives matter is being considered
at least in the betting markets
for the nobel prize as well
in that case i think black lives matter
as the movement
not the specific organization
now how much prestige
would you assign to the nobel peace
prize
if two of the top top entities under
consideration
are two of the most discredited entities
of all time
well it kind of makes the whole thing
worthless doesn't it
i certainly don't see black lives matter
as pursuing peace
even even if you were completely on
their side
what does no justice
no peace mean to the nobel peace prize
because to me it sounds like we're kind
of a little bit
sort of not getting pro-violence
if we don't get our way that feels like
if you were going to draw down on paper
and you said to yourself
hypothetically what would be the
least like a peaceful organization that
you could imagine
what would be the absolute opposite
of a peace promoting situation
well i would say it would be someone
whose famous chant
is no justice no peace
it's really the opposite uh the world
health organization of course is owned
by china and gave us bad advice on the
coronavirus
which killed a lot of people to the
extent that the coronavirus
is like a an enemy you know it's like a
war and the coronavirus is our enemy
which side was the world health
organization on
it's a little unclear i mean obviously
they did helpful things too
but uh i would say that situation is a
little bit ambiguous
i've got a clarification from i think
from yesterday's
periscope i was talking about the
possibility that some people
might be genetically inclined to be
super spreaders
but i won't name names but i've been
informed by someone who knows a lot more
than i do mostly
including reading the actual study that
i i tweeted around
um that the super spreader
is more accurately refers to
a situation than a person
so whether or not there are people who
are more likely to spread it than
other people by something about them uh
that would be still unknown
but we do know that situations where
people are in close contact
seem to be the super spreader situations
that said
does it make any sense to you that a 400
pound
mouth breather would be the same amount
of risk
as a 100 pound person
who doesn't breathe as much you know
wouldn't it
matter how much volume of air you're
moving
around you makes no difference
i mean maybe it makes no difference
because it could be that regardless of
the volume of air
it's the same amount of virus because
you only have so much in you maybe
who knows but i would not rule out
the possibility that there's some
difference in who could spread it
even if the only difference is how big
you are and what your lung capacity is
seems just common sense there must be
something there
all right one
um i asked on twitter we'll talk about
the president in a minute
but i asked on twitter how many people
have
uh are watching less drama
movies or drama tv or reading
dramatic books and 62
of people said they either stopped
watching uh
fictional drama or they or they cut way
back
two-thirds of people almost two-thirds
of people
cut back on their entertainment and
drama
i wonder if that's a permanent change
because it might be
now i don't know if it's only because of
the the stress
there's just too much stress in real
life so people don't need any extra
that's i would think that's the big
reason and
the reason i ask the question is i've
completely eliminated
drama from my life in terms of
entertainment
so i won't watch a drama movie
definitely won't read a drama book
we'll watch a drama tv show just don't
need
even fictional anything i don't need any
of it and
when i every once a while i'll sample
something
because i'll say to myself well this is
this is sort of a light drama
you know it's you know it's not really
that violent or anything
if five minutes in i'll say why am i
watching
entertainment which is literally
designed
to make me feel tense so that they could
make me feel better at the end or feel
something or cry at the end
why would i want my emotions to be
manipulated for entertainment
they're they're way attenuated already
the last thing i need
is a little more piling on to my
emotional
stability when there's plenty of reasons
to be
alarmed
another politic some other reasons that
people have given for watching
less uh tv drama
is that it's too politically uh
heavy-handed have you had that
experience
have you had the experience yet where
you think oh this might be a good movie
and you turn it on and it's so anti-male
that you just say uh i don't really want
to watch
something that's anti-male and then you
turn the channel
and say oh i'll try something else and
you turn it on and
it's anti-male and then you think
well maybe that's a coincidence and then
the insurance
commercial comes on and it's anti-male
it feels as though all entertainment has
turned into
anti-male entertainment
uh i don't know if i've told anybody
this story before
maybe i've told this on periscope
if i haven't this will be i think the
first time i might be telling it
in public maybe i said it on a podcast
somewhere
and it goes like this some of you know i
was trying to write a dilbert movie
a few years ago i had converted a room
into a movie writing room in my house
i had notes all over the walls i had the
scenes drawn out
and i had pretty much the entire plot
worked down in my head and i just needed
to you know finish the dialogue and
pull it all together and i abandoned the
entire project
after i would say a year of work
and i abandoned it cold why'd i do that
the reason was i had written it
to be anti-male and i didn't really
realize it
because it wasn't any kind of a
conscious decision i'd made
i had just sort of written it with the
influence of the world
in my head and and the plot
everything was sort of designed so it
would end up with
you don't need to know the details but
it was more of a celebration of women
and
men not being so competent now of course
it was in a humorous context and it was
supposed to be an
interesting reveal at the end and
everything and when i was done
i was actually disgusted with myself and
i was also completely conscious
that i'd fallen into these these um
you know social justice model of how a
movie needed to look
and when i realized that my creative
choices were so compressed
that there was only way one way it could
be
i couldn't just write a movie i couldn't
just write it like real life
i couldn't write it interesting i
couldn't do anything with it
unless it conformed to this narrow band
of what
you know is socially appropriate and
when i realized that i had
fallen into this super uncreative
ditch where i couldn't get out because
if i changed it
it would no longer look appropriate and
so
i abandoned the whole thing probably
millions of dollars
you know in terms of potential uh upside
because i could probably get a movie
made if i push hard enough you know
i have enough connections etc but
i just couldn't be part of that so
that's
part of why people are watching less i
think
somebody else suggested that social
media is just more inviting
so compared to the the quick hit you get
on your phone
a movie is boring how many of you have
had this experience
you turn on a movie or you know let's
say
sports or something that used to
completely entertain you
you watch for about a minute and the
next thing you know you're playing on
your phone at the same time
and you're sort of watching the movie
but the phone is more interesting
and then the next thing you know 15
minutes has gone by and you didn't watch
the movie because it wasn't as
interesting as your phone
so that's part of it and then somebody
suggested that
at least when it comes to sports that
it's hard to watch
the blm kneeling
sports so there's some people who are
turned off by that
i've got a feeling that the entire
entertainment
landscape is really really in for a
shock
uh more so than it's already had along
those same lines
i tweeted a video of uh
it was one of the kids who was killed in
the parkland shootings
from a few years ago and his name is
joaquin oliver and although the
the teenager was killed during that
tragedy
they brought them back to life as a deep
fake in other words they used
computer generated technology
they called it ai but i'm not sure
exactly if artificial intelligence
is really the right term for what they
did maybe i mean
uh i'm not saying it's not true but i
don't know exactly what the ai part
would be but
here's the thing they created a
full a full-sized you know body
movement uh fake of the deceased
teenager talking to the camera and doing
sort of an
anti-gun presentation
and you could if you were looking for it
you could tell it wasn't real
barely just barely could you tell
that this thing wasn't real and
here's the question i ask given the
weird coincidence
that the deep fake technology became
mature
exactly now at the very time that you
can't really easily make a movie
because of covid so real actors can't do
their work
at exactly the same time the digital
version of actors
became practical
that is a weird coincidence isn't it
it's almost like
why is it a coincidence that the
protesters get to wear
masks because of covid which really
makes the protest more effective because
they wear masks
that's a big coincidence there's a lot
of big coincidences happening with this
code stuff so it could be the end of
real actors in hollywood or or the
beginning
of what will obviously be the end of
them because why would you hire real
actors if you can create
digital ones that once created it would
be expensive to create them the first
time
but once you've created a fully realized
digital fake you can make a lot of
movies
using the the characters that you've
already created
if you know and if it's a sequel let's
say the sequel has
you know the main characters are just
the same ones
it could get really really economical
how long will it be before there's a
digital tom cruise
that you know doesn't look like tom
cruise but is the
let's say the charisma equivalent you
know you look at the digital and you say
oh that's pretty good
pretty interesting person there not long
i think we're about there
um all right
uh see what else is going on of course
the president went to
walter reed you all know about that um
and uh
there's just so much to say about that
so let me just start at the beginning
um rasmussen reports did a funny uh
tweet this morning and said they said
news alert
it has now been over 24 hours since uh
potus was asked publicly if he denounces
white supremacists
a constitutional crisis surely looms
so the you know is funny
because it's based on something that
feels true the entire
news industry had completely
formed around they were just going to
keep asking this one question
in different ways and that was going to
be the news cycle until the election
how many ways could we ask the president
does he really seriously
denounce white supremacists again
well he just did it like five minutes
ago
well but does he denounce it now
because that was five minutes ago and by
the way we don't remember it
what do you mean you don't remember
here's a video look i'll play the video
for you here
watch this i denounce all white
supremacists there you see
good five minutes ago it's on video
there you go
does he denounce it now what is wrong
with you
it's right here from five minutes ago on
video
you can verify this is real yeah
but he said white supremacist but he
didn't mention
neo-nazis which is kind of striking
well but it's all the same thing i don't
know
is it i think we're going to need a
little clarification
because you know white supremacists yeah
they overlap
they overlap with the neo-nazis but we
need a little clarification on neo-nazis
well here's a video of him denouncing
neo-nazis
calling them neo-nazis that's a little
older
that's that's months old does he still
i mean how do we know he still denounces
them so that that was
the cycle that we were about to be in
which was just
horrible in terms of
boring news it's almost as bad as
somebody famous dying and you just have
to listen to that for
five days yeah we respect the people who
died but
it ruins the news cycle for a while if
we're being honest
um so
why doesn't the white house get some of
those coronavirus
sniffing dogs i talked to you about
those before
so apparently it is actually possible
and it has been
demonstrated to work you can teach
some kinds of dogs to detect coronavirus
even before they have symptoms
how cool would that be because i can't
imagine it would be a faster
more reliable way to you know have a
continuous
checking in the white house than to
literally have a white house dog
who just walks around and sniffs
everybody all day long
you know even if they've had a recent
test give them a sniff
can't hurt so uh
i get that there are not many dogs who
have been
trained yet but if you had even one dog
that you were pretty sure could sniff
coronavirus
that one dog needs to be in that one
place
right you know if ever there was a place
for a corona sniffing dog
yeah you'd like to put them in the you
know senior citizen homes and the
the elder care homes that's great well
let's put one of those dogs in the white
house
i feel like we've demonstrated the need
for that
um and plus it's a great visual
how much would the press just love to
death
a white house dog that was actually
protecting the white house literally
an actual dog protecting the white house
it would be video candy
so let's get let's get a sniffing dog
um so let's talk about how any of this
is going to affect the election
right now i would say first of all
that events are are changing and
morphing
quite quickly so whatever we think
is likely to be the outcome of this as
of today
check back in 10 minutes because there
might be so much that's changed
that you know any hot take is just
obliterated in 10 minutes
one of the ways that happened is more
people getting coronavirus
uh diagnosis so it was one thing
when the president had it when the
president was the only one we were
talking about
obviously lots of people have it but
when he was the one we were focusing on
at the white house what what did you
feel about that
well you probably thought okay it's a
story about
you know the left is going to say he's a
dumbass he deserved it by not wearing
masks
didn't take it seriously it's karma
you know got what he asked for and of
course
the republicans would say some version
of
uh well he asked the public
to go back to work he went back to work
he took normal precautions maybe even
better than normal precautions
and it didn't work out but it was the
same risk he asked the public to take
so of course you want him to take the
same risk
that he's asking you to take you know
just feels more like leadership
so it was going to be spun that way but
probably the bigger theme is that there
would be empathy for the president
you know it's hard it's hard to dump on
somebody when there's
when they're down so even joe biden
quite cleverly
quite cleverly uh announced that they
were going to pull all their
negative campaign ads now
that was a really smart thing to do the
way the public is going to see it
is wow that's that's what good people do
you know they they don't dump on people
when
when they're down but it was of course a
brilliant political move
because by biden pulling the political
ads
what does that make you feel about
president trump
does it make you feel uh more empathy
i don't know maybe but what it makes you
feel is that he's weak
if biden had kept the pressure on uh
campaigning at full strength with full
negative campaign ads he might get a
little blowback for being too aggressive
possibly but it would also make trump
look
strong because you don't make your full
court attack
against somebody who's weak so biden
got this perfect opportunity i think he
was well advised unless it was his
decision
he was well advised that they could save
money on tv ads
that's good save a bunch of money a week
of ads probably a lot of money
at the same time by saving the money on
the ads
he can look like a nice like the nice
person in the race
that's a bonus saves money looks like
the nice person
but it's the third thing that's the
killer the third thing
who is it that you go easy on
if you ease up it's because the other
person is weak
in some way so he's managed to frame the
president
as very weakened at the same time he's
making himself look like a nice guy
at the same time he's saving money
that's about as
good a play as you can get out of a
campaign
so whoever is advising the biden
campaign at least on this stuff
very very competent in fact i would say
overall the biden advisors have been
pretty good
i'm going to sneeze this is going to be
ugly
trying to hold it hold it see if i can
get past this these
okay i think i did all right um
now the fact that um so many people
have now been diagnosed with the
coronavirus
i think completely changes the narrative
when it was mostly the president you
could say a big part of the story is we
feel sorry for him there's empathy
don't dump on him and you know we hope
he does well etc
but as soon as you realize that a lot of
people in his inner circle
got infected and i think it's up to nine
people kellyanne conway
three senators a priest
um ronald mcdonald mcdaniel
once you get that many it really changes
the story doesn't it in my mind it
changed the story from
oh you know we have some empathy
because the president's sick to wait a
minute
are you telling me that that because
they did not take proper care
and because they did not wear face masks
as they would like the public to do
and because they had a public gathering
in tight spaces
everything were not supposed to do and
that it worked out
exactly the way the experts would say it
would
if you do these things you're going to
have
this outcome we experts tell you
are there any experts who disagree well
not too many
you can always find the the skeptics etc
about masks and social
social stuff but most experts
left and right most experts would have
said
that all of those things the white house
did are
exactly the things you don't do
they did them in public they got
pretty pretty big infection rate
it could be the end that could be the
end for trump
the fact that this is so
um starkly
incompetent yeah i don't know if you
could use any other word
you know you know i like to put the best
spin on it
but if it just been the president i
would have said bad luck
just bad luck and maybe even good role
modeling
but the fact that the entire events
seem to be that poorly protected
now i'd say the narrative has shifted to
incompetence
unfortunately you know now
you don't have to like that but i don't
know how you can escape it
now does that mean that in my opinion
that the not wearing masks and the
social distancing is definitely the
cause of all those infections
i don't know i don't know you have to
think that anybody who would not wear a
mask and would
you know hug people in public uh
during a public event during a
coronavirus they're probably doing
similar things at home don't you think
don't you think it's a group of people
who by their nature
are either going to be lacks with masks
all the time you know at least if they
can get away with it
um or are they only lax with mass
at the white house so the first thing
you have to ask is
is there something about this group of
people who are unusually unwilling to
take the the precautions that most
experts should say
all right so i think the uh the
president has a big big problem with
that
now how can that change between now and
election day
well we could find out that there's more
news
that's still going to happen between now
and election day
than we've seen so far all year if 2020
stays in character there's good stuff
that hasn't even happened yet like and
it might be the big stuff
you have who knows what it could be
but it could be big and uh
we'll wait for that so everything that
we think is true
on any given day between now and
election day just
assume that it could be wiped off just
the way the coronavirus
diagnosis of the president wiped
everything else off the
off the map
all right one of one of the problems
that the public
and the press are having with this
situation is
it didn't fit into any model that we had
before
you know for almost anything that comes
up in the news
we can always say well that was like the
1826 gambit the 1968
convention and very similar to the 1979
you know thing that happened and now we
say okay is it more like which one of
those things
and then our brains can wrap wrap around
a new thing
say okay it's a new thing but it's like
these other things
the president getting the coronavirus
this close to election
this is not like any other thing
there's no model that you can go to and
say all right all right
if it worked out this way before and
this is sort of similar
this is how this will go we got nothing
there's no history that informs us
there's no common sense that tells us
where it goes
there's no road map just don't know
in terms of how it affects the election
etc so
that is unusually disconcerting
in a otherwise disconcerting uh
way but here's one possibility
let's say that things go the way of the
best
script you know i've talked about this
before
there there's some reason and i don't
know why
that you often get this situation where
real life goes the same way that a movie
script would have gone
in other words the most interesting
thing that could happen
actually happens now you're seeing this
with president trump getting chronovirus
if you were writing the script and this
was just a movie would you give
president trump coronavirus
yes yes you would because that's what
would make the story
extra you know interesting
as sad as it is and tragic extra
interesting
but what would make it extra interesting
from this point
on now i'm going to give you some
some ideas of what that could involve
but this is very important before i talk
about this
i want you to understand i'm not wishing
for any of this to happen
very important i don't want anything
that i'm going to
describe to happen it just falls into
the category
of the most interesting thing that could
happen
don't want it to happen i'll say that in
the middle and i'm going to say it at
the end
don't want any of this to happen you
seriously
do not want any of this to happen all
right
now that you're primed you're all adults
you can handle this thought
right don't freak out and i wouldn't
talk about this outside of this
periscope too much
if i were you do me a favor don't spread
these ideas onto social media let's
sort of sort of keep them here for for a
while because if you take them out of
context it'll
it'll get ugly number one the best
and when i say best i mean most
interesting
not the one i want to happen the most
20 20 like thing that could happen would
be
biden gets coronavirus
and doesn't survive
obviously i don't want that to happen
obviously
but if this were a movie
that's the way it would go because the
moment
biden got coronavirus it would make you
say wait a minute wait a minute the
entire story has been
that the people who didn't wear masks
and didn't hide in their basement
many of them got coronavirus so that
anecdotal bunch of stuff
was my entire impression of what's what
the risk is
you're telling me that biden mr mass
in my basement do everything right you
tell me he got it
now again it wouldn't mean anything in
terms of
your understanding of how risky it is
etc
it shouldn't mean anything because it
would just be one data point in
anecdotal
but it would it would change how you
think about it
all right so that's one possibility
here's another possibility
again don't want this to happen
really really don't want this to happen
and it goes like this
president trump takes a turn for the
worse
i don't think that's going to happen
very unlikely but
you know in terms of scripts he takes a
turn for the worst
and it gets so bad that you could argue
that he was momentarily dead
and brought back what would happen
under the unusual situation that
president trump
became so ill that he was technically
dead
and brought back jesus
it would be an actual literal
not not literal but a resurrection story
uh it you know unlikely
yeah very unlikely that things would get
to that point i don't even think that's
the thing with corona
coronavirus patients i don't know if
there's any case where that's ever
happened
that they were technically dead and
brought back to life this probably never
happened
but again if it were a story
that's sort of where the plot might go
don't want that to happen
don't want that to happen don't even
want to put it into the universe
we don't want that to happen there's one
more
that is so it's so awful
i almost don't want to mention it except
in the context
of telling you how this script idea
works
there is one outcome don't want it to
happen
don't want it to happen
but in a 2020 world it could happen
and it goes like this president trump
gives the coronavirus to kellyanne
conway
who gives it to george conway who
if i may be unkind
has a physical look of someone who would
have a tough time surviving coronavirus
right it's an ugly thought i'm not even
going to complete it you can you can
complete it yourself
but that's one of the possibilities
that george conway has a tough time with
it and it came from the president
right again you don't want that to
happen
you know you don't want you don't want
your your enemies to get a coronavirus
certainly not political enemies that's
that's just dumb
um but it's 20 20.
along those same lines there are two
people that i'm
in addition to george conway that i am
quite concerned about so i would say
these three people
just raise a little flag of concern for
me and i
you know i'm not going to be political
about this i would be concerned
equally about all of them bill barr
chris christie and george conway
they are three people who have been
close to exposed
people and they have a little they've
got a little extra weight on them
and they're uh you know i would be a
little extra concerned about those three
and if anything happens to any of the
three it's just gonna be
extra tragic all right um here's a
question i have for you
um shouldn't we know by now
if masks work now i get that
all of the the experts not all of the
experts
that the uh consensus of experts
is that masks not only work but they're
vital to getting to the other side of
the coronavirus
but here's what i i wonder don't we know
by now
uh lots and lots of people who got
coronavirus
don't we know whether or not they wore
masks or were around other people who
wore masks
shouldn't we know by now by talking to
all the people who have got coronavirus
were they in a mask intensive
environment
or a mask permissive environment
wouldn't that be just about the easiest
thing to track at this point
because you just talked to the patient
say did you have coronavirus yes
would you self-report that you have
consistently been
in a very mask intensive environment
where both you and the people around you
were being
pretty dedicated about wearing masks yes
or no
scale of one to ten how masked up were
you
and socially distanced shouldn't we know
by now
exactly how effective mass are
and the fact that we're even talking
about it is
just making me think there's some kind
of mass incompetence that's going on
in in this system in general not just
the politics
uh i don't maybe that
information is out there somebody says
there's not a consensus
no you're wrong you're wrong there is
absolutely a consensus
it is not universal a consensus means
that the majority of people agree
consensus doesn't mean that there are
not notable critics
who make a lot of noise i will
acknowledge there are notable critics
and i will acknowledge that i'm not
convinced
that i've seen hard data that says that
masks are working in this coronavirus i
think they are
i would say that the smart money says
yes i would think that common sense says
yes
i would think our experience from the
pandemic in
1918 tells us they work i would think
the fact that
every single country is using mass
if they have a coronavirus problem all
of them yeah
all the experts in all the countries
seem to agree that mass work
so i'm going to say if you were going to
place a bet
you know scott you've got to put your
money on masks
work or they don't i would place a very
large bet
on that they do work now they may have
their trade-offs
i wouldn't argue that but i would
certainly put a very large bet
on they do work speaking of
things like that um the president
it is reported is let's say he's on
regeneron
vitamin d zinc
now rem deserver and i saw speculation
from a doctor
that he was almost certainly on
convalescent serum
now what is what is the impact of doing
all those things at once
i don't know i don't know if anybody's
done all those things at once
um putting the president on remdezavir
which my understanding is is not a
hundred percent safe
but rather you would want to save that
for somebody who's
who is looking like they have some real
problems
what does the fact that the president's
getting rim deserve at this stage
tell you about the seriousness of his
infection
i think it's telling us one of two
things
either the president is being treated as
a special case
meaning they're treating him more
aggressively than they would
somebody who has the same amount of
symptoms
which would make sense that wouldn't be
the dumbest thing in the world but rem
deserves
my understanding is it doesn't have any
impact
if you're at the lightly infected stage
correct me if i'm wrong i need a fact
check but isn't rem deserver
understood to be something you would
only give to somebody who's in pretty
bad shape
because at that point the the little bit
of risk that comes with it
is worth it right
i think the melatonin was just for
sleeping
um somebody's saying in the comments
so here's the weird thing about this
cocktail that the president's getting
there are a few weird things number one
it seems like he's taking
every drug that's ever been mentioned in
a sentence with coronavirus
except hydroxychloroquine
what are the odds that the white house
doctors knowing that hydroxychloroquine
has a very safe profile and
knowing that that the president would
probably have a bias toward
giving it a try if it were not
dangerous and maybe it would work
what are the odds that they would not
prescribe hydroxychloroquine
it's a little weird isn't it because
even if you thought
the doctor said now we're not convinced
it works the studies are a little
ambiguous
you know why bother maybe but even if it
was in the gray area
for perfectly political reasons don't
you think they'd say
you know we don't think it makes any
difference but it probably won't hurt
you
do you want to take some
hydroxychloroquine because i feel like
the president could have
enough influence on that that he could
just say
look if you don't think it's going to
hurt me i'd like to take some just for
political reasons
you know just just to be consistent
so for the first thing i'd ask is maybe
he is taking it
or maybe he was on it prior to even
being
diagnosed so i think there's more to
learn about that
but interestingly he is taking
zinc and as you remember the zelensky
protocol as it was called
required zinc as as well as azithromycin
and by the way i haven't heard he's
taking his xithromycin
so they're silent on that so far
but maybe maybe the reason that the
uh that we think hydroxychloroquine
works
is that it was used with the zinc enough
times that maybe it was the thing that
worked
maybe who knows
but apparently the doctors are convinced
enough that zinc won't hurt you
and might help that they're giving it to
them that's interesting
a little behind the scenes information
for you
so you all know of dr zielinski and the
zelinski
protocol which was hydroxychloroquine
zinc and azithromycin
given early at first symptoms um
i i will tell you that the doctor has dm
to me
a few times two or three times and i
haven't responded
and he's dm to me looking for me to
boost you know boost his message about
the hydroxychloroquine
i have declined to do that
because i'm not convinced
that it's real and i don't think
cartoonists
should be boosting signals of things
uh for doctors i feel as though it would
somehow give it more credibility than
the story by itself
would have now my last estimate
prior to this week and i've lowered it
over time
is that i started with something like a
50 chance
i don't know if it was higher it might
have been early on
the 50 chance that hydroxychloroquine
might be real and my work
and that was based on the fact that
there were lots of reports that it was
working
so that's good but they weren't quite
the
you know the randomized controlled types
and it seemed to me that if it worked
the way
people said that it would be obvious by
now
and that it would be in widespread use
all over the world
there would be more use not less we'd
hear more about it not less
if it worked now every month that goes
by
and you don't hear a story like that oh
we just discovered it totally works
it's being widespread used in albonia
and now we're all going to use it
every month you don't hear that story
lowered my odds
that it's working so last week it was at
30
chance meaning there was a 70 chance
this is just
scott's own personal uh estimate
70 chance that hydroxychloroquine didn't
make a difference
30 percent chance it did still based on
so many anecdotal
or not anecdotal observational studies
etc
today if it's true that the president is
not taking it
if that's true we'll wait for that
confirmation
it probably is i would
take it down to closer to five or ten
percent
yeah maybe uh i'll go generous 15
1-5 so i think the odds of
hydroxychloroquine being a game-changer
15 percent one five that's my per
current estimate
subject to adjustment should
it ever be needed now the president's
also taking vitamin d
i would like to um note
that it is entirely possible that the
very first first person you ever heard
say take vitamin d for the coronavirus
might have been me because when it first
came out i was telling you get in the
sun
get your vitamin d up because at the
very least it's good for your immune
system
and now there's there seems to be more
and more evidence that that's true
so if you'd listen to me what good shape
you'd be in
um so
it turns out that the most dangerous job
in the world
is trump campaign manager
do you remember when corey lewandowski
was the campaign manager
and he got falsely accused of uh
aggressively grabbing some woman
uh grabbing her arm not not sexually
grabbing her
and that turned out to be you know fake
news but
that it was pretty tough to be a
campaign manager he was replaced by paul
manafort
who ended up going to jail for unrelated
you know crimes unrelated to the
campaign then there was brad parscale
who recently
got involuntarily committed to a
hospital after losing his job who knows
what's going on there
and now bill stephen gets a diagnosis of
coronavirus
so if you ever had to pick a job that
was going to be dangerous
yeah if you were going to pick something
dangerous it would be that job
all right
so here's a question that i've been
asking for a long time
we keep hearing in the news and we're
hearing it from both
the left and the right sometimes so uh
so fbi director ray has said this
you kind of feel like he's on the right
a little bit
or somewhat and uh and the left says
that and they say that
the biggest uh problem with domestic
terrorism
is white supremacy now i keep hearing it
but i'm trying to connect in my mind why
is it that
literally every night literally every
night
i hear about antifa and left-leaning
you know people burning things and
getting hurt and attacking people and
killing people
so i'm hearing every night stories about
the left
and domestic terrorism but i'm not
hearing stories about the right
and yet the fbi and other important
entities are saying
the big problem is white supremacy now
i'm not doubting it's true
so as of today i would say i'm not
doubting is true
because there are a lot of people saying
it's true
why is it that i'm not hearing about it
and i would like to give you a story to
prime you
before i tell you the rest of my story
about my search
for all of the white supremacy
statistics
years ago when i was working for pacific
bell the local phone company
where i lived i had a project
to build a laboratory within within the
headquarters
where we would test our technology our
new digital technology for the phone
network and we would use the laboratory
for customers who wanted to make a
buying decision
but they needed to test our equipment
with their equipment to make sure it
worked
and i was told by my boss that we just
keep getting all these requests
from customers and if lots of customers
are requesting
a laboratory to test the equipment it
follows
that if we had a laboratory to test
equipment we'd sell a lot more equipment
because if you could show the customer
it works look you know i just hooked it
up
here's your phone here's our network
there it's working
now you can feel safe buying it so i was
given the task
to first build a business case to get
the funding
and then go ahead and you know be the
project manager to build the laboratory
so i started out to build my business
case by uh
collecting data about all of the
customers
who would ask for this laboratory
because it was all based on customer
demand right
it wasn't something we just sat around
and came up with it was just purely
responding
to this avalanche of customer demand so
i would go to
you know a manager who was in a relevant
place that'd say
you know do we need this laboratory for
customers and the manager
would say yeah yeah we totally need it
all the customers are asking for it it's
high demand and i would say can you give
me the name of a customer
who asked for it so i could actually
talk to the customer
and really you know dig down and find
out about this demand
and the first manager would say well i
you know i don't know the name of a
specific customer
but there are tons of them so maybe talk
to this other manager and he could give
you the name of somebody
to talk to talk to the next manager he
goes yeah it's like
the customer demand they keep asking for
it i go can you give the name of one
customer
he's like well you know i can only think
of one
but why don't you talk to them and maybe
we'll kick up some other
some other ones you can talk to so
what i determined after a long analysis
was this
there was ever only
in the since the beginning of recorded
time
one customer who asked for it
once that was it
one customer had asked for it once but
because when that customer asked for it
they asked probably more than one person
and then those people started talking to
each other
and then people heard about it it became
an entire story
about a mass request for laboratory
resources
that literally didn't exist
didn't exist it was confirmed and i went
back to everybody and said
anybody except this one customer
everybody said the same customer
that's it and then i asked
well what happened with that one
customer i assumed that they did not buy
the product
because they didn't have a lab and then
the managers told me oh no they bought
the product
so i said all right let me get this
straight
the story that there were lots of
customers really boiled down to just
one and the reason we needed a
laboratory is that they wouldn't be able
to buy without the laboratory
and the one customer actually bought
anyway
thus proving beyond a shadow of a doubt
we don't need a laboratory now once i
presented that to my management do you
think they said oh
i'm glad you caught that we could have
wasted 10 million dollars which was the
budget
we could have wasted 10 million dollars
building a laboratory that nobody needed
do you think that happened
nah no it didn't my
my boss said build it anyway
make a case for it build it anyway in
other words the reason had nothing to do
with the decision
the data had nothing to do with the
decision the logic
none of it even revenue none of it had
anything to do with the decision
i just had a boss who wanted to be the
boss of a laboratory
because it would be good for his career
i guess so
so that was the story all right now take
that
story and that's what i've learned
because of my experience how
this can get blown up and then i'm
looking at this white supremacy thing
and i'm saying to myself it's kind of
weird
that's the biggest problem and yet
i'm only hearing of these other problems
but i don't hear a lot of examples of
this so i
go to do a little bit of research and
when i say a little bit of research i
mean just you know
you know one millimeter deep i'm not
going to spend a lifetime doing it
so i just google some stuff about you
know data on white supremacy and uh
i i find this um
here it says the the threat posed by
racially or ethnically motivated
terrorism
particularly white supremacist terrorism
remained a serious challenge for the
global community
all right so what follows this should be
some examples right and here they come
continuing a trend that began in 2015.
all right so it's a trend
so if it's a trend there'll be some data
to show the trend
there were numerous deadly attacks well
okay
there are numerous of them so now what
we'll follow will be the list of them so
i'll just see how numerous they are
and so and it lists three i go okay well
it says there are numerous but there are
three and there were uh let's say
included the christ church uh new
zealand
okay uh halle germany
holly halley germany and el paso texas
so the first thing i said to myself is
oh
okay they're talking about worldwide and
two out of the three didn't happen in
the united states
so really there's one
it was the el paso texas where the guy
went into
a walmart i guess and his complaint he
had a manifesto
about immigration and i think he shot a
bunch of
uh presumably mostly targeted people
who he thought were immigrants i'm
guessing
and so i thought okay well that one all
right so we have one example
but it's real all right there's no
question that this guy
was a massive white supremacist and i
thought
this will be obvious when you read his
manifesto
because if you read the manifesto it's
going to be pretty clear
he's a white supremacist so i read some
of his manifesto
he was anti-immigration because he
thought
immigration would turn the country into
democrats
and the democratic system would destroy
the country
do you know the part where he said i
don't like immigration because
the people coming across the border are
brown
that wasn't in there or at least i
didn't see it i read excerpts from it
i would think that they would have
pulled that out if that was an excerpt
but it turns out his real concern was
democrats
literally it was about democrats
now you could certainly make the
argument that he's also
a racist but he didn't write that
he didn't write white people are awesome
i don't want any brown people
he wrote that he didn't want democrats
because they would ruin the system and
we'd all die
under a democratic system basically i'm
exaggerating
so of the three that were listed
of the so-called numerous deadly attacks
two of them were in other countries
which doesn't make them less important
but it makes it less important to the
united states
and then the one that was listed sort of
a
little bit of a gray area if you know
what i mean now
because this will be taken out of
context may i say
at this point i completely disavow
and rebuke all white supremacists
kkk racist white nationalists
so i disavow all those groups
i'm just saying that i was sold the
story about massive
white supremacy problem and the three
examples given
are two from other countries and one
that doesn't look like it to me
i get that it's a gray area but
these are your good examples so
here's the question i have is it like
the laboratory story
where there never really was a problem
and and because of the telephone effect
and somebody talks to somebody and
somebody's talking about a gray area and
some things in other countries
and and maybe there's more activity
online
could it be that massive online activity
is foreshadowing something that'll that
is a really big problem
but the actual violence has not been big
in terms of numbers
is that possible i mean that would still
be a major problem i would
if somebody described it to me that way
and said scott you're not seeing the
the big issue here it's not so much how
much has already happened
it's it's that we can see it brewing
very clearly
number of people associating with these
groups is growing
the the rhetoric is getting worse
if that's the story i'll say oh okay
that's fair i don't want to i don't want
to be seeing some big white supremacy
movement that's picking up steam in the
united states i'd be quite concerned
about that
as as well you should be but i don't
know that that's a story
is it the the the news business
is so thoroughly broken that you can't
even tell if the biggest problem
even exists think about that
think about the fact that you can't be
sure even a little bit
if the thing that your government and
the fbi
is telling you is the biggest domestic
terrorism concern
you don't even know if it exists much
less being your biggest concern
you can't even tell now common sense
tells me there must be
you know plenty of examples there must
be
but why doesn't the news have a list for
me that's handy that i can say
now if some by the way if somebody has a
more
complete list of white supremacist
um events in this country i want to see
the list of this country
uh could you dm that to me or
tweet it at me because i don't want to
be the guy who says it doesn't exist
i want to be the guy who says why isn't
the news
telling me where it is i'd like to know
more about it
okay um
i'm just looking at your comments now
all right i think that's all i got for
now
and i will talk to you later
all right periscope is off and uh
now i'm just going to be talking to you
youtube folks
um how is this
experience work for you i don't know if
i'll do this again
i'm not sure how the sound is working
etc but
i wanted to experiment with this and see
if anybody uh cared
i've got over 3 000 people watching
that's pretty good
and people are actually tipping me with
with
these super chat things thank you very
much i appreciate that
you don't have to but i i do appreciate
any support it does
i have to admit that um since obviously
i don't need the money but i'm totally
motivated by it
meaning that if somebody is willing to
tip me and they don't even
it's not even required it totally
changes my opinion about the value of
what i'm doing
which completely changes my you know
willingness and how much
energy i put into it so i do appreciate
that it does
it does motivate me
all right i'm just looking at your
comments you seem to be
pretty happy about uh this
and thank you very much all right that's
all for today
i'll talk to you later
you
