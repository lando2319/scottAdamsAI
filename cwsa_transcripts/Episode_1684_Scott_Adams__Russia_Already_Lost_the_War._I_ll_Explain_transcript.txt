[Music]
good morning everybody i didn't see you
there you snuck up on me
well it is terrific to see you and may i
congratulate you
on
succeeding once again at finding coffee
with scott adams the most marvelous
thing since the beginning of time
and we'd like to take that up a notch
wouldn't we wouldn't we
yes it looks like it's unanimous
we like to take it up a notch by
grabbing a
you know you know what's coming
copper and margarine glass i think
you're jealous of stein they can't eat
jerry with less you have a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
do you know i like coffee
now fill it with your favorite liquid
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine kit of the day the
thing that makes uh just about
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go
oh my god
it's almost like a psychedelic feeling
it's so good
i i don't know if you could feel that
where you were but wow
well marco rubio senator rubio uh
has figured out how to be useful and
he's
championed a bill in the senate that the
senate passed
but still needs the house to pass it to
stop changing the time twice a year
can we
just make marco rubio president if he
just gets this done
i've decided
that i'm going to lower the bar for
president
anybody who can get this done
has my vote for president
so if rubio can get this time change
cancelled
i i think he's earned four years he'll
have to earn the second term
but in my mind if he can just do this
one thing
president rubio
and i would expect that the house will
turn it down
the funniest thing about this is
that congress can't pass the law that
everybody agrees with
let me say that again
the funniest thing about this
is that congress can't pass a law that
everybody agrees with
i don't know why
does anybody know why that they actually
had to game it and wait for the actual
time change to introduce it so that
people would still be you know sleepy
and angry
and then they could get a pass to the
senate but too many days might go by
before the house gets ahold of it
they might forget this old time change
thing and think there was some reason to
make the world
greener or something
so
it's the most important topic of the day
you know i do think you could probably
calculate how much productivity is lost
by the time change
but also
i'm gonna make a bet without looking at
any data
about there are more traffic accidents
what do you think
do you think the time change would show
a little blip in traffic accidents maybe
violence in general
i'll bet
you know i don't have any data to back
that up but i'll bet
it would make sense
people have been asking me since i've
been saying some uh things about putin
if i'm
afraid of being poisoned by polonium
because that sometimes happens to
putin's critics
but
i am one step ahead
for months now i've been micro dosing on
polonium
just to build up my resistance
because if he comes for me it's going to
be like i had two shots and a booster
i'm going to be like
polonium that's like the sniffles
come on
i'm thinking of wearing a mask
some people say that wearing a mask
would not help me from
polonium poisoning but i follow the
science unlike you i follow the science
so
anyway i'll be ready
and kids
if you're thinking of doing this
don't do this at home do not microdose
on polonium
uh it involves
breaking into a secure facility in a
foreign country
and stealing one of the most secure
items
in the history of humankind
and then
selecting exactly the right amount that
won't kill you
it's hard
so i don't recommend you do it but
i'll be ready when they come for me
as joel pollock uh pointed out in a
tweet
so far vladimir putin has done more to
punish hunter biden for his corruption
than the entire american government
true
because putin's put sanctions on the
some clintons and biden including hunter
biden i guess
and uh
okay that's it's a joke
but it's literally true
at least in terms of the punishment part
not not the reason for it
well maybe who knows
president biden lowered
our confidence in him a little bit more
today
by tweeting
that oil prices are decreasing and gas
prices should too
last time oil was 96 dollars a barrel
gas was 362 a gallon now it's 432 431.
he says in his tweet oil and gas
companies shouldn't pad their profits at
the expense of hard-working americans
and this is the day that we learned that
biden believes
that prices are
are set based on cost
does he know that that's never the case
not just about oil
but about everything
[Laughter]
try buying something based on the cost
you should buy something based on what
what they know the the market will pay
all prices are based on what people are
going to be willing to pay that's it
it's not really the cost of production
now in the long run it could be the cost
of production
but
as long as the oil companies are selling
as much
oil as they want to sell
why would they lower the price or
the gas stations
now of course they're also anticipating
you know future higher expenses and
they're working with this psychology but
to imagine that
prices have ever depended on the cost
i mean obviously you want your price to
be higher than the cost that's obvious
but how much higher is just dependent on
what people are willing to pay
always has been
always will be
so biden is
you know presumably i'll give them i'll
give them the benefit of a doubt that he
probably knows that
but he thinks it's good persuasion
because other people don't know it
and in that he might be correct
if this were trump i'd probably say you
know it's not actually the way things
work
but if it convinces people it should be
that way maybe it might have some
benefit might lower the prices
he might actually embarrass the gas the
the industry to lower its prices
good work
so as a uh persuasion play it might be
might be fine
and and if he knows what he's doing then
that's or his advisers or whoever wrote
the tweet
i i would have given trump a pass on
this
so i'll give biden to pass on this too
all right
um
rasubison poll says that uh 76 of
americans
are in favor of welcoming ukraine
refugees
uh
are we a super racist country
way more than i thought
just a little bit a little while ago
because how do we explain this
two ways and neither of them are
flattering
all right they're they're
somebody says in the comments on locals
that that the ukrainian women are so hot
and that's why that's why they're
welcome well
okay first of all i'm not going to argue
the point because i think the point is
solid
but
how do you explain how many people are
are saying give us more refugees
well i would explain it the following
way
number one
if it's a country that has a high
standard of education
it's probably economically a pretty good
deal
so it would work for the united states
in the long run it would work for the
ukrainians of course
so it could be purely economical you
know people look at it and they say you
know we're we're getting
people who
probably have been exposed to a little
bit of english our guests at least the
business people
get a lot of skills they could probably
be retrained fairly easily
so
it could be that people are just looking
at it and follow the money just works
every time
even if people aren't thinking that way
so i've told you this before right
that follow the money works even if
nobody involved is thinking in those
terms
consciously it just always seems to work
weirdly
and this could be another case now
another case another situation is that
the brainwashing of the media which has
for whatever reason made ukraine the
most important thing in the world
suddenly
is maybe it's just brainwashing
and so we have we've created this
sympathy for the ukrainians
is artificially
you know just
put into our brains
so maybe some of that
and uh
yeah so i'm not sure exactly how to
explain that number but
i don't think it's good or bad it's just
interesting how quickly people's minds
got to a place where 76 would be on the
same page
you don't see that too much
vice president harris was being uh
criticized for
saying in public
this sentence the united states stands
firmly with the ukrainian people in
defense of the nato alliance
now of course ukraine ukraine is not in
the nato alliance
which is you know
in many ways the whole point of the war
is what's happening with ukraine and
nato
but
um
then i guess in the transcript they
added a word to clarify
the word and
but they they showed that they added it
so they indicated it was an added word
they weren't trying to hide that part
and so it would say and
so that they're doing two things they're
defending ukrainian people but they're
also and separately
defending the nato alliance so that
would be the clarification
i will
be consistent with my clarification rule
48 hours to clarify
have i not stated that that's that's the
standard i would like to see
that is the standard i'd like to see i'd
like to give people 48 hours to clarify
i think within 48 hours they clarified
and i accept the clarification
because
let me let me try the realty test on you
okay can we do this i'm going to try the
really test
it goes like this
the vice president of the united states
didn't know that the whole point of the
ukrainian conflict that she has been
sent to moderate
she didn't know
that ukraine is not part of nato
really
really
that that's the position you would
defend
that she actually literally
really really really didn't know
that ukraine was not part of nato
really
okay in my opinion the really test works
on this one
i i know you're being a little stubborn
in the comments and you're and you're
gonna
you're gonna go with your interpretation
that you didn't know that
but honestly people
i i feel like you need
if you think that this is real
just take a second look
uh here i'll tell you what i'll tell you
what
let me give you instead of trying to
change your mind
instead of trying to change to me this
is obvious fake news i don't i don't
think this could be more obviously fake
news i think the clarification was
correct
that she meant to support nato and also
separately ukrainian people
and it's very straightforward and simple
and no there is no way
that the vice president of the united
states was unaware
of ukraine's nato
non-status
there's no way she didn't know that
all right and she didn't like forget
momentarily that didn't happen
but look how easily you were convinced
that that actually happened
how many times have you seen
people on the left convinced of
something so easily
that was so obviously not true
a lot right
it happens to us too
how many times have you seen me buy
something at least in the short term
buy into something that was just sort of
obviously not true
and i'm like delete my tweet
right it happens to all of us
right i'm not i'm not picking on anybody
this is a universal human
capacity we we just believe things first
sometimes
but but let me ask you again
now that i spent a little bit of time on
it i'm just going to ask you the same
question again do you really believe
that the vice president united states
didn't know the ukrainian status for
nato with nato
really
say it say it again say yes if you
believe that
i just want to say
okay there's still a lot of yeses
all right
now and you also know that i have a
super low opinion
of the vice president's capabilities
so i'm very much on your side
about her let's say her leadership
capabilities but there's no way she
didn't know that
all right so
let let me uh
let me give you a challenge
okay
find somebody you know
maybe on twitter
it could be a could be a blue check or
not
somebody you know who's really good
at seeing both sides of things
and then ask him this question
do you really think that the vice
president didn't know that fact
see what they say
see if the people you trust
the people you trust not the people i
trust but the people you trust see if
they agree with you
i'd be kind of curious about that
i don't even know i'm not even sure how
that would go
what if it's me
why did she tweet it down again the next
day she didn't
she didn't
all right
could i be wrong about this
what do you think
apparently you think i could be
all right would it make you feel any
better if i agree with you on that
i i think this is
this is within the realm
within the realm
of something i could be wrong about i
mean i could be wrong about anything but
it's within the realm but if i had to
put a bet on it i'd take ten to one odds
i mean
easily there's no way to actually prove
it so i can't make that bet
but if the if it were provable
in some way that everyone would agree
i'd take ten to one on this one
it's always productive to think of
things in terms of the odds instead of
you know yes no it just makes you feel
smarter
all right uh
russia already lost the war in ukraine
this is my thesis for today and i'm
gonna i'm gonna call it
that as of today
the fog of war is clear enough
that while we don't know
we don't know the details of what will
happen there will still be some
surprises
but i would say at the as of today
in my opinion very subjective of course
that's what we're doing here
subjective opinions but in my opinion
it is now completely clear
that russia lost the war
now lots more fighting to go on but i
don't think that the end point could be
anything but that
and i'll tell you what signals i'm
seeing
first of all let me give you some
context
and i i keep i keep reminding you of
this because
i think it was actually
pretty interesting
that i think i'm the first person you
heard in public say
that russia had some surprises coming i
i literally tweeted that
um and that the
military technology that the ukrainians
had
would be surprisingly effective and that
russia wasn't going to waltz in there
and
hold everything in 48 hours
now
i didn't hear anybody else say it i
didn't hear a military expert say it i
didn't hear anybody say it
and people mocked me for it
am i correct you probably saw me getting
mocked for saying that the ukrainians
would do a better job than you think
because of the technology
and and sure enough here we are
so at this point would you say that
every expert agrees with where i was
yes right
it is the technology that's making the
difference now i don't want to
underrate
the ukrainian resolve and ukrainian
bravery which is
insane
i mean
you know you talk about brave people
but the ukrainians are just
i mean they're they're redefining the
standard in my opinion i mean it's
pretty impressive
um
you know i suppose
anybody would fight hard for their
homeland
so you do expect a tough fight
and so i don't want to minimize that but
the difference would be the weaponry you
know having lots of resolve wouldn't
help you if you didn't have good weapons
lots of places they get conquered have
lots of resolve
they don't have good weapons
so
here are the signs number one there is a
fourth general reported killed in the
russian army
now
i know
is that believable
because it sounds exactly like ukrainian
propaganda doesn't it
a fourth general
killed so far
i'm going to say
no more than a 50
chance that's true
what do you think
50 percent chance is true
less
i would i would go last 25.
but it is a sign that the ukrainians are
either killing a lot of generals
or they're winning the persuasion war
because we sort of believe it
seems believable
i i saw a list of all the generals
that have died under suspicious
circumstance
under various russian leaders
now who knows if that little meme was
correct but
can somebody confirm that generals seem
to fall out of windows and commit
suicide a lot
in russia over the last let's say 50
years
so
maybe
it's a sign that uh
putin is killing them himself
because we know the generals are not
performing
so maybe maybe putin is killing him
maybe putin just calls the number two
and says
go kill your commanding officer and
you're in charge now
maybe
i mean
you can't rule it out
and yeah somebody just said the taliban
won as well
yeah a very different situation but true
that
so
all right so you've got the uh the
northern army of russia seems to be
stalled and
it does appear that the ukrainians have
cut them off from their supply lines
it does appear that they have low
maintenance and
the inability to move their big
equipment
and it appears that moving into the tree
line
wasn't so much that they could you know
it's a good place to shell or or to fire
artillery from
it looks like they're hiding
it looks like they're hiding at least
that's the current thinking from the
people who are observing over there
so if the northern army is bogged down
they're only a week or two from starving
now the ukrainians are in pretty
desperate situation too
but i suspect that their supply line is
holding so far
and i doubt that the russian supply line
is holding they're probably forging
forging in the ukrainian
countryside for whatever they're getting
and they might be just about out of that
however much they could forage has to
you know that amount is going to
decrease really quickly
um
mortars are taking out russian artillery
in the woods is that
is that happening somebody says that's
happening i don't know
um
so and i'm seeing the comments uh that
we've been saying for weeks that they're
a week or two from starving
but the
um
but the wild card there was that they
stood they had that
originally they were a week or two from
running out of food
but that meant the food that they
brought with them
it looks like they can extend it by
foraging and stealing stuff from you
know the locals
but their ability to do that presumably
is going to
you know fall off a cliff pretty soon
because the locals will pull all their
food back
as far away as they can or destroy it or
or it'll all get eaten
so it does seem like the the first few
weeks
they weren't likely to starve because
they could always you know reduce their
rations and forage and stuff but i feel
like we reached the point where the next
two weeks they're just going to starve
and i think they might be killing their
own generals at this point
here's a question for you and it might
require somebody with vietnam experience
are there any vietnam vets
watching right now
people who actually were in combat in
vietnam
because here's something that i heard
from a vietnam vet years ago
that the news will never tell you how
often
uh people kill their own senior officer
they do it in the field they just you
know drop a grenade and it looks like it
happened from the other side
yeah fragging
now
does anybody know how often that happens
it happens enough that there's a word
for it
i can tell you that the guy who told me
about it
told me he did it
not to his commanding officer but to
someone else he had a he had a problem
with
he actually
that the
he actually said now i don't know if
it's true it's just something that
somebody told me and remember this is a
story about himself
it's not a third party story
actually admitted murdering somebody in
his own squad
with other people they they just agreed
to murder somebody
and they just murdered him
and later they just talked about it yeah
you know they murdered him
and
so does that not happen in other
military
is that something unique to the american
military i doubt it
seems like that would be something that
happens in a lot of militaries
and i can't imagine a place that would
be more likely to happen
than a bogged down starving russian army
whose mission they just found out is to
kill people who look and sound just like
them
i've got a feeling that morale
is pretty low
so i don't know if these generals are
being shot by putin shot by their own
forces or shot by ukrainians
or not shot at all and the entire thing
was made up
all possible
and all point in the same direction
so in other words you don't even need to
know if any real generals at all were
killed
if the only thing that happens was that
is that the ukrainians
have owned the news cycle so totally
that it's being reported as news
and then maybe it just didn't even
happen
that also signals that
russia's in a lot of trouble
right if they can't even control
something like that
um so we're seeing of course that the um
it looks like kiev is going to hold it
looks like more weapons are going in it
looks like the sanctions are crushing
and i don't know if
if russia has quite realized
that there's no such thing as making a
deal where the sanctions go away
do you think they realize that that's
not a possibility
that if the sanctions go away
then you can never use them again
let me say that again
if the sanctions are what you know cause
some kind of a good result from the
ukrainian point of view
they could never be used again
ever they would never be used if they're
temporary
they have to be permanent
now permanent means as long as putin's
in office
which could be 30 years
right
so
there has to be a standard set
that you can't make peace
in return for lowering sanctions
the only thing you do is make peace and
return for peace
because i'm going to make a prediction
and it's based on the fact that
zielenski i think he just announced
where it's being reported i don't know
if he announced it it's being reported
that the ukraines are going on offense
what would that tell you
if the ukrainians are going on offense
anywhere
what does that tell you
probably tells you that some of the army
is trapped
probably tells you that they've taken
out their con
their supply lines
it probably tells you that the new
weapons coming in from
you know nato sources
is good stuff and plenty of it
and it does look like zielinski is
looking for a clean wind
and by the way i think he's saying that
now out loud
i just read a interview i think he was
on cnn with uh david petraeus general
petraeus
petraeus talks about the four possible
outcomes
in ukraine
for the first time
at least that i saw a general who knows
what he's doing
said the fourth possibility is the
ukraine wins outright
petraeus said that
right now again
the first person you heard say it was me
the second person was general petraeus
now he's not predicting it
let me be clear he's not predicting that
he but he has added it to the option set
now it's one of the things that could
happen
now who was talking about that happening
whoever talked about that that the
actual possibility of ukraine winning
militarily i'll tell you what it looks
to me
i think ukraine is going to
take out some
some big
russian
units
you know just really
really get some victories
because if ukraine gets to something
that looks like a straight up
straight ahead military victory
what is that going to do to the rest of
the russian army
that is starved and trapped
it's starting to look
like ukraine is playing for the win
wouldn't you say
now
um of course you're going to say
what does winning look like if your
cities are flattened because russia
plans to go all grozny and they're just
going to
depopulate and destroy it i think that
will happen too well i mean it is
happening there's no question
but
who's going to rebuild
do you think ukraine will rebuild faster
or russia
because russia is going to have
sanctions
forever
unless they take a whole bunch of money
from china
and how much do they want to do that
because you know you don't want to owe
china too much
i think the ukrainians uh control public
opinion to the point where
uh europe and the united states
and other countries will help them
rebuild
because if they get something that looks
like you know they could be peaceful for
a while
i think there'll be plenty of investment
but russia won't have that capability
so
yes it looks like ukraine will be
flattened
i don't think there's a way to
avoid that
and
but it does look like and their their
losses will be horrific
but it does look like they're going to
come out of this in better shape
in other words they'll be more flattened
but they'll recover faster i don't see
russia recovering while putin's in
office
all right
now i see many of you doing uh
essentially the
comment equivalent of eye rolling like
who is this guy you know about me
but i remind you that contrarian
predictions are kind of what i do
sort of evolved into that
now they're not always right
so if you think i'm always right
i don't think i'm always right
but i do think it is important to put it
out there so at this point
here's my take on this
i think that the russian army is such a
mess
that the
well-trained ukrainians with
the support logistical support of nato
is actually going to take them out
that's my prediction
did i did i convince anybody
see i'm seeing uh
interesting there seems to be a
difference between
mostly notes
some yeses
trump's uh full send interview is taken
down by youtube is that true
yes what i think is irrelevant you were
correct
oh you're watching me why are you doing
that
you're
some
uh reparations yeah maybe
i think the ukrainians are gonna ask for
reparations but russia won't have any
money to repair anything all right the
other funny story from this is that elon
musk as you know
challenged putin to a
physical fight
on twitter and said that he meant it
and then
the head of the chechens
offered to train elon musk and then
insulted him by calling him effeminate
and basically calling him a woman
because it turns out that chechens
are very sexist
i don't you might not know that
but the chechens they believe
that
men can fight better than women
and so for them a
an insult is uh to call a man who wants
to fight a
equivalent to a woman
now they have not learned as we have
learned um in the united states
and we learned this from science fiction
that uh on any science fiction tv or
movie
a 95 pound woman
can beat a 200 pound man every time
really every time
so they don't know that i guess the
chechens they don't have tv over there i
guess
but anyway
so the cheshire guy
in a mocking
way offers to train elon musk and
renames elon musk
ilona
so he nicknames elon elona to insult him
for his
uh woman-like
presence i guess
uh elon musk being elon musk immediately
changes his twitter profile to ilona
and of course tweets back of course
and he thanks him for the offer but
thinks that
it would make it unfair if he got any
special training because it's already so
unfair
now
after i saw this
i immediately said to myself you know as
one does
if elon musk really gets to fight putin
one-on-one
i'd like to get in on this and i've
challenged lavrov
their foreign minister
i think i could take lavrov
one-on-one now he looks kind of big
to be honest it looks like he's
probably 6'4 or something
but
he smokes
and i'm wiry
sure i'm not that big
but would you want to fight me
i'm wiry i tell you i'm wiry
i could take him in
two rounds i think
and so
oh you don't need joe rogan for this
somebody says joe rogan
come on
that would be too easy
you want at least something that you do
a pay-per-view right
joe rogan that's like his 12-second
fight
including introduction
you know i i i'd at least make it
interesting but i think i could take it
because do you know why i could take him
i'm wiry
it's because i'm wiry
he'd never see it coming
now
my real trick the the way i beat lavrov
is
if i go directly at him he's going to
see it coming and that's no good so what
i'm going to try to do is i'm going to
try to
lure lavrov into
attacking me in my own home
because once i get him onto my home home
territory
i'm going to have some advantage
and
once he's once he's on in my home i'm
going to
trap him there and cut off his supply
lines
and i'm going to wait till he starts to
starve
and then i'm going to kill him
i'm going to attack
he'll never see this coming
who would ever
think of a plan where you
invite the stronger person into your
house
cut off his supply lines
until he starves
and then you surround him and kill him
who would ever think of that
zolensky
zolensky
all right um
so appear apparently uh here's another
indication that russia has lost the war
uh they said they were
talking about maybe ukraine would have a
neutrality like a switzerland or sweden
model
hey there's something i
suggested on day one
but
apparently the ukrainians have rejected
the neutrality offer why do you reject
an offer like that
why would you reject an offer for a
peace when your country is under so much
attack
why would you do it
because they're winning
that's why
i don't think ukraine wants the world to
know they're winning yet
because if if they find out too soon
we're going to stop giving them weapons
so i think ukraine is already
turning things their way
but i don't think they want to say it
yet
i think the time to say it is after
they've wiped out you know a division of
russia's finest fighters or something
you know after they've after they've
done something that is militarily
surprising
you know just like a big victory
then
then zelensky is going to say
no deal
no deal
you might even ask for reparations you
never know you wouldn't get them but i
might ask for
um
so the uh uk
has somebody in the uk as uh i don't
know if it's sources or intel or
somebody
thinks russia will run out of manpower
in 14 days i don't know what they mean
by manpower does that mean people starve
or they're stuck so they just
don't have enough people to fight but
one of the things that
petraeus said
is that in order to
conquer and hold a city you need five
times as many soldiers
as
russia has
so
connect the dots
do you believe that petraeus is correct
that
holding holding territory takes
five times as many soldiers as there are
there
i feel like
i feel like that's something that you
know and the problem is that you have to
have somebody stay
every time you conquer something
so you can't take the same force and
just like move through a city
some of that force and a lot of it has
to stay every time you conquer something
so you need five times as many people
as it takes to conquer the first block
because you're using up your people to
hold it as you go
so that makes perfect sense right
you you would expect
petraeus would know
that it's a basic math fact right it's
just math
now of course if they level the city
that's a different calculation but to
hold it
which is all they seem to want
can't really do it
so since we know russia can't hold it
and it looks like the ukrainians will
have infinite support you know to keep
them fed and and armed from the outside
there doesn't seem to be and russia's
running out of manpower some are
estimating
it doesn't seem there's any way for
russia to win this
i think it's already over
over in the sense that you know how it
can end
and it's not good for russia in any way
i saw ian bremmer also tweeting
that
whatever it looks like militarily russia
lost
you you can say that already ukraine
lost too
you know you could argue you ukraine's
even a bigger loser
but russia definitely lost
they lost this war it's already lost
they can only you know change the
details a little bit but it's lost
would putin go nuclear if he's trapped i
doubt it you know i think that russia is
probably a lot like the united states in
the sense that
i don't even think putin could order a
nuclear attack
i don't think he could
now i wouldn't bet my life on it
although i sort of am
but
i think if he lost his mind and was
going to do something as irrational as
send out nukes
that there would be several layers of
people saying yeah nope
that's where we draw the line because
that's my family
right
uh
mike says scott adams is listening to
total bs russia already won
well
the this is the
this is the part
where it's the reason you watch this uh
live this live stream
if i said what you were already thinking
there wouldn't be much point in watching
but you have my opinion and now you have
your own and we'll get to compare
putin is crazy people are saying
he may be crazy but i think there are
other people who are not as crazy
bbc said they have kiev yesterday
but can they hold it
it doesn't matter if they can't hold it
does it
because russia's economy will be
destroyed
and ukraines will probably be rebuilt
but the russian army isn't going to be
able to stay there
the russian army will be defeated
it's being pointed out that i said that
i would be
i would not be objective on this topic
well i'm showing my work
am i not
i i'm giving you reasons for all of my
opinions
so you can judge for yourself whether
that's a bias
good are the reasons crazy i mean which
part which what did i say
and by the way i'm not denying that i
have bias in this because i think
everybody has bias on this topic
but what did i say that isn't
reasonable
i don't think anything i said isn't
reasonable
um
all right just looking at some of your
uh
comments
all right
you believe the convoy hoax
what part is the hoax
what's the convoy hoax
by the way anytime anybody says i
believe a hoax you always have my
attention
well russia is definitely killing more
ukrainians i assume
then ukrainians are killing russia is
that what you mean by winning because i
would agree with that point
but it doesn't look winnable
so they're in a non-winnable situation
is what i'm saying
prediction you'll do a trans and sports
shuffle
what's that mean
meaning a diversion
all right well you keep that prediction
see how it goes
scott what exactly do you wish would
happen
oh that's an interesting question
um
well of course you know the obvious you
wish you wish that the citizens and
and really everybody there
is safe
so you know
aside from wishing that
people's well-being is uh is maximized
the obvious thing
i think the most healthy thing for the
world in the long term
is that the economic war against russia
works
because if it works it makes a regular
kinetic war
less likely i think
because there's one more you know
way to destroy somebody
so
i think that's an important precedent
and given that whatever happens
in ukraine is going to be a horrible
tragedy and there's doesn't seem to be a
way to avoid that
at this point if you're going to have
the tragedy you need to get something
something out of it
and that is something the only thing i
can think of
would be that we prove the economic wars
work that would be used to it
let's talk about this you know so i get
a lot of questions about
talking about the
currency question and
petra dollars and
russia and china coming up with their
own
currencies and reserves and stuff like
that
but let me tell you why i'm not talking
about it
i don't think anybody knows anything
about it
we don't know what they're doing
we don't know if it'll work
and i don't think he anybody even
understands the topic
i
you know like as i tell you too often i
have a degree in economics and i'm and
i'm following the story of like who's
going to do the reserve currency and all
that and i think to myself
i don't know what's going on
maybe other people also don't they don't
admit it
but
i i would be in the top
let's say let's say of people who have a
background in education and experience
to understand the topic i would be in
the top
two percent
probably if you took 100 people
and said let me explain this currency
thing and you know the petrodollars and
everything
i don't think you'd get more than two
people who would understand that
because you'd it's hard to understand
and
i could comment on it but i feel like i
would just be flailing in a it'd be like
me trying to explain physics
without a physics degree i i don't think
having a degree in economics really even
helps you because so much of it is
psychology
you know
one assumes that from a technology
perspective you could do anything
so
you know
everything's an option technically but
you have to get people's brains
to treat things certain ways and and to
put faith in things and to have
confidence and
it's the psychology that's completely
unpredictable
if you could predict that you'd really
have some skills
you could guess but you can't predict
um jimmy dore says there are nazis in
the ukraine army
i believe there probably are some bad
people in every army
i'm not defending them
in fact
in fact if one of the outcomes is that
russia gets rid of the nazis and the
ukrainian
army
oh that could be good but you know i
don't know how many i don't know how
many there are
so that that's another story that i stay
away from a little bit because i don't
believe anything about it
i don't believe that we understand
the average opinion of the as of
battalion
i mean we've seen clips so we know what
some leaders have said
but it wouldn't surprise me if you
talked to the members
and you had you know privately
well maybe they just joined because
their friends are in it i mean
who knows what's going on over there
who knows
what
it's a huge problem somebody says it
could be
i'm not
i'm also not minimizing
that
the size of the problem could be bigger
than we think it could be i'm saying
that it's just a complete
black box over there we don't know
what's happening
but you know no nobody wants nazis in
charge of anything in ukraine
um
yeah all right that's all i've got for
now
and uh i believe i have achieved my
objective
of giving you the best live stream in
the history of the world
even better than yesterday and
uh and
you know what's amazing is it could be
even better tomorrow
yeah yeah it could be
and uh
we will see you tomorrow
best show ever i'm sure it was
