talks are down a little bit not
terrible but not
great we are going to have a show of
shows today it'll be like nothing you've
ever
experienced let me make sure I got my
comments
working sure enough there just one more
thing I can't start this show when I've
got a little itch on my back back where
I can't reach it hold on oh god oh and
that's why you have a telescope
telescoping back scratcher at your
desk get
[Music]
one good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
if you'd like to take your experience up
to a level that nobody can even
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need for that is a cuper
mcro glass a tanker cheler Stein a
canteen Jer flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure that dopamine here
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called what simultaneous hip
that's right go
sastic all right well you know what I
usually
do I usually start the live stream with
some science updates and then I say
something like well you could have just
asked me because it was obvious what the
result of that scientific study was
going to be but now instead of showing
off all of my scientific knowledge I'm
going to ask you dear viewers to see if
you can get these these ones right I'll
tell you what the study was and then you
tell me what the result of the study was
you ready okay study according to S
poost there was a study to find out if
uh people tend to mate or at least you
know become girlfriend boyfriend or or
or get married uh are they more likely
to be attracted to people of similar
physical attractiveness now I'm not
saying that you wouldn't be more
attractive to somebody who's more
attractive than you but when you
actually get together when you actually
pair off are you more likely to pair off
with somebody who's in your same
relatively same range of
attractiveness and the answer is of
course you are did you really need to do
a study for that you know unless one of
you is is super rich or something
something no people pair off with people
that are roughly in their neighborhood
why would you do otherwise if you pair
off with somebody who's just way out of
your range they're going to cheat on you
because sooner or later they're going to
be wait a minute how did you trick me
into marrying you I am so much better
yeah no people people find people who
are
similar all here's another one also from
cost um there was studying to find out
if people are attracted to altruistic
Behavior so if you were in a situation
where you were single and you saw
somebody of your preferred gender the
one you like and they were being
kind and altruistic doing something as
like a favor for somebody else would
that attract you what do you think did
they need to do this
study no they didn't need to do the
study of course it attracts
you of course people being nice to other
people um yes yes okay we didn't need to
waste any money on that one all right
here's another one they're going to get
tougher all right those were easy here's
a tough one now somebody studied vitamin
D supplementation vitamin D do you think
it was helpful to have more vitamin D
was your health better if you had more
vitamin D
yes it
was have you ever seen a vitamin D study
where they said you know we studied the
hell out of it we couldn't find any
difference in your health it's it's like
it didn't matter if you took it or not
no every single study shows it's good
for your health but
specifically it's good for your acute
respiratory tract infection huh an acute
respiratory tract
infection sounds like Co which we
already know vitamin D is very important
for
protection all right you're three for
three no science was needed you all knew
the answer to that before you even saw
it here's one all right there was a
study on uh erectile dysfunction
meds so meds to get your stuff
stiff and was it associated with more
deaths and cardiovascular ular de
disease and Dementia or fewer deaths all
right this one's a tough one so erectile
dysfunction meds like
Viagra uh and the likes there's two
kinds
to tadalfil and
cenil so were those associated with
making you healthier in
general or do they have a negative
effect what what do you
think I'm seeing more deaths fewer
deaths more
fewer the answer is that both of these
drugs are super effective at keeping you
alive
apparently listen to these numbers this
is from UTMB health
study uh according to the Montgomery
County Police Reporter so mortality
overall was reduced
34% with the tadalfil and 24% with
sadal did you see that let let me just
say that
again taking uh these erection
dysfunction Med medications for man it
reduced their mortality by
34% and the the worst one was
24% are you getting heart attacks were
down 27% with one 177% with the other
the the one that gives you the best
benefit is the one that lasts the longer
so I guess to delill lasts longer so the
more you do the better the benefits so
the one that lasts longer gives you
substantially more General Health
benefits Strokes are down
34% or 22% with the other one um
Venus
throl throom bolism Venus throom bolism
is down
21% which is very important because I I
felt a little Venus throm bism coming on
I feel it I feel some thr bum bum
bism right
now and how about
dementia 32% reduction in dementia
because you've got Ed
meds now um I'm going to tell you
something that I'm at that place in life
where I can be useful have I ever told
you that I just try to be useful it it's
one of the it's one of the best hacks
for happiness if you can be useful to
other people ideally your family the
people you're close to but if you can be
useful to anybody it's going to make you
feel good I'm going to tell you
something things that the doctors don't
tell you because they're not hypnotists
they're doctors and and even the
scientists won't tell you this because
they're scientists but number one you
ready for this so this is in the
category of things you can't say if
you're worried about being
embarrassed but I'm
not past all of that number one if
you're in your late 50s or 60s and
you're not not taking one of these
meds you're
crazy you're crazy because I get it that
you know there everybody's different so
some of you will be you know exactly
like you're 25 years old when you're 70
but not most of you not most of you so
here's the first thing if you if you
think it's embarrassing or it's it's
like you know somehow your ego is
lessened don't think about any that it's
it's like one of the best drugs of all
time trust me number
two number two the scientists will tell
you and by the way I don't know anybody
my age who doesn't take
it I think pretty much everybody my age
if they have any any kind of anything
going on pretty much all of them so
that's the first thing you you need
somebody who's uh not embarrassed to
tell you that at a certain age it might
be different for you but at some age oh
you should absolutely definitely be
taking these drugs now know you know how
I always tell you um I don't give you
medical advice this is not medical
advice it's social it's relationship
advice you still need to go through your
doctor to get them you can't get them
over the counter so your doctor will
tell you if it's a good idea medically
what I'm telling you is lifestyle and
relation reltionship go do this trust me
there there like several let's say let's
say 100,000 people listen to this live
stream recorded um as well as live and
of a
100,000 I probably just dramatically
improved the lives of about 5,000 people
is that
cool it's one of the things you get to
do if you have a live stream it's just
something that maybe you hadn't thought
about that way or maybe had some
hesitation or you told yourself oh I
don't need that I'm a man I don't need
that little pill oh it's the best thing
ever it's the best thing
ever right here's the second thing they
don't tell you you know how they always
tell you but it's not going to change um
your arousal it'll only allow your body
to react to being in the mood so it
doesn't put you in the mood
mood it only allows your body to respond
if you're in the mood is that is that
what you all understand everybody
understand it that way it doesn't put
you in the mood it simply allows you to
be in the mood if you were going to be
there anyway totally
false 100%
false let me explain I don't know why
science is is so dumb on this let me
explain
this um
there are two things that make me
happy being happy and then pretending
I'm
happy if you pretend you're happy it
makes you
happy if your body feels good it makes
your brain feel good if your brain feel
good sometimes even that'll make your
body feel good your brain and your body
are the same same device we only
separate
[Music]
them why I don't know just because there
are schools for brain surgery and a
different school for setting bones that
are broken I guess so we have these
human reasons for saying that the brain
is separate from the body but in all
practical ways they're just one unit so
here's what I'm going to tell you that
every hypnotist will agree with by the
way are there usually there are a few
hypnotists watching because they know I
talk about this content but watch if
there's anybody who's a a psychologist
or a hypnotist you're going to agree
with what I say right now if if your
body starts reacting in a sexual way
your brain will just follow
it yeah no they're completely lying when
they say it doesn't put you in the mood
because if if if taking one of those
pills causes you to feel a reaction
which would be normal you you'd just be
like huh huh you feel a little reaction
there there almost nothing going on it
immediately puts you in the
mood you can't have an erection and not
be in the mood
it's just almost impossible so when they
tell you it doesn't put you in mood it's
true that it's not designed for that and
it would be true that if you know you're
if you had just some horrible traumatic
experience it's not going to help you
because the traumatic experience would
be too big but if you're just having a
normal day and your brain is you know
not in the sexiest
mood the bill will put you in the
mood now I'm not going to say it's 100%
of the time
but it's close to
100% look look at the reactions so the
people who are brave enough to say oh
yeah I use it it's great so here's what
I'm doing for you I'm going to take the
embarrassment part out it's
tremendous um talk to your doctor about
the health part of it I can't recommend
that but lifestyle
wise um oh my God yeah you you'd be
crazy not to be honest after a certain
age you'd be crazy
all right here's the next one uh science
science question according to the
marijuana Herald damn it I gave away the
answer
shoot I shouldn't have told you who the
source was the The Source totally gives
it away but here's the question uh is
cannabis use asso associated with more
or less cognitive decline over your
lifetime the people who smoke a lot of
marijuana do they have more cognitive
decline than average or less cognitive
decline since everybody has some
decline what do you
think ah ah I see both I see
huh huh I see less I see
more so here's how you should have known
the answer the source was the marijuana
Herald do you think the marijuana Herald
is going to is going to report about a
study that makes you die from marijuana
because I think the marijuana
Herald is kind of pro marijuana just
guessing so the answer is that uh
there's a pretty big
difference the regular marijuana users
maintain their cognitive abilities
substantially better than
non-users how many of you would have
guessed
that it's sub stantial yeah now in both
cases you will lose some cognitive
function over time but the heavy weed
smokers only lose a little bit the
people who don't smoke it at
all much bigger
chunk bet you didn't see that coming did
you now of course I believe all science
that agrees with whatever I want to you
know whatever's good for me so may not
be true but I choose to believe it for
recreational belief
um I will tell you that my experience of
it is exactly
that my experience of it is that it's
keeping me more cognitively sharp like I
can actually feel that so but that's
anecdotal all right here's
one um there are reports I was reading
this on the X account Vigilant Fox which
is a real good follow if you want to
follow lots of good updates and stories
and stuff
Vigilant Fox all one word anyway uh
there's story of a doctor who would
routinely U prescribed non-GMO diets no
matter what the patient came in for so
it was a doctor who if you came in for
you know joint pain or digestive
problems or fatigue or anything else um
she would she would treat you in the
normal way that you get treated but in
addition she would say you should eat n
GM Foods now I'm not so sure that
non-GMO foods make a difference I am
sure that highly processed foods are bad
for you pretty sure sugar is bad for you
I don't know exactly what
GMO I don't know why a GMO would be bad
for you maybe I'm not saying it isn't I
just don't know one way or the other but
uh the report is just enormous health
benefits across a whole range of things
by getting people to switch to non-GMO
diets I'm not sure this is
real you makes me wonder if what really
happened is when they went to
non-GMO maybe what they really did was
they just cut down on drunk
food you maybe people were just more
alert to what they were eating which
would make a big difference to all these
categories so that part I believe if you
just took a bunch of people and said all
right stop eating junk food and only
start eating these certain kinds of
foods I could see that that would work
I'm just not convinced that the GMO part
of it is the active ingredient it might
be so I I would say this is science that
should just make your eyebrow go up but
certainly not confirmation of
anything meanwhile The Wall Street
Journal says that beans are getting uh
get a big boost apparently people are
eating more beans and it's becoming more
of a social media thing and people are
talking about which beans they're eating
and and I guess beans are real good for
you you know beans and peas and
lentils um so that's good the uh the
nation is eating more more
beans all right here's
one let's see if you can guess this this
will be the last scientific guess one uh
there was a study according to the
guardian to find out uh if if it's true
what everybody assumed to be true that
most psychopaths are men and that
therefore there's a far greater number
of psychopaths who are men than women
was that
confirmed or did they find out that
there there are just as many Psychopaths
who are women it's just that they use
their powers differently which is
it the answer
is there's a suggestion that it might be
closer to a
tie meaning that when we assess
Psychopaths we tend to assess them on
male
criteria violence right when you think
of a psychopath you think about oh would
you do some violent thing and then not
feel bad about it that tends to be more
of a male behavior in general violence
but if you change what you're looking
for such as let's say verbal violence
you know somebody who would say
something that would be ter damaging to
somebody but you wouldn't care suddenly
it's closer to a tie yeah so women
according to this study would be the
Psychopaths would be down for violence
that's more like the social violence and
Men might be more inclined to the
physical violence but still
Psychopaths so way more Psychopaths than
we thought according to the
guardian here's a cool thing the
University of
inbrook um they're experimenting with
the to see if they could use a uh a
betting Market to guess which studies in
science could be
duplicated so you know there's this
gigantic problem of peer-reviewed
studies that when somebody else tries to
duplicate them they don't work which
means that peerreview is kind of
broken well apparently if you say that
the science instead of how about a peer
review
if you just made the paper available and
then you said hey let's bet on whether
this re is reproducible turns out that
that uh the scientists do a pretty good
job of betting which ones are
reproducible now that would be I think a
great addition to the uh to the whole
stuff the whole science I'd love to at
least add that bit of information
wouldn't you love to know if there's a
new study and you'll say hi
hypothetically 75% of the experts who
look at it
think I don't think that one's going to
get reproduced wouldn't you like to know
that that feels pretty useful I mean as
long as you know it's it's a statistical
and it's not a guarantee it just means
that this one's not likely to work out
in the long run I think that'd be good
to
know anyway um CNN is uh shocked to
learned that X went from being when it
was Twitter he had 65% of Twitter users
were
Democrats did it feel like that to you
in the Twitter days did it feel like
two-thirds of the users were
Democrats maybe it did yeah maybe it did
but at the moment this is Tai so
Democrats 48% Republicans
47 does it feel like it's a tie
now it does not
so whatever the algorithm is doing it's
completely closing me off from any
Democrats rarely do I have any encounter
with a Democrat on social media I've got
1.2 million
followers almost never run into a
Democrat now I'm exaggerating a little
bit not much it's got to be 20 to1 100
to1 something like that
so that's interesting that's working out
but meanwhile there's a competitor or 2x
uh I think this is a jack who left
Twitter and I think he started it but
it's called Blue Sky and they got 20
million users but they're already
running into the so many bad um posts
that are getting reported that they're
overwhelmed
with bad material so they're struggling
with that mean The Washington Post is
set to lose $77
million just this
year and that was before the boycott
erupted when Jeff Bezos the owner said
that he wasn't going to endorse K Harris
and after he said that they lost a
quarter million
subscribers holy they lost a
quarter million subscribers because bezo
said he wasn't going to pick favorites
and and just sort of give you the news
and that's a lot of people who weren't
watching it for the news they were
watching it because it agreed with
them so let me say this about
that If This Were a business The
Washington Post and Jeff Bezos was
saying to himself I'd sure like to make
sure this business is successful and
makes me some money do you think he'd
still be in this business the answer is
no it's very obvious to anybody who's
got the tiniest bit of business
experience that this is not a business
you could probably fix it's I'm sure
it's pretty
unrecoverable it's purely a drain on the
assets of whoever owns it fortunately
Bezos can afford
it
but I think we can stop pretending that
it's a real business can't we I I think
if you're going to lose $77 million
every
year and there's no real realistic way
that that's going to go to a positive
number I mean really there's no way
that's going to
happen but it's still in
business what's that tell you well it
tells you for sure the purpose of it is
not to make money so it's not running as
a
business and I'm not entirely sure that
the purpose of it is to give you better
and you know better
information I've got a feeling the
purpose of it is pure
propaganda and
brainwashing because it's the only thing
that would be worth that much money to
somebody right if you had that much
money it might be worth it because you
could change you know the whole nature
of the government um by changing
people's minds through the
media but even Jeff Bezos I don't think
he'd pay $77 million a year just to have
this kind of influence when he could
probably do it in a hundred different
ways so I just feel like he's under
duress I mean everything about this
screams the government is making him do
it you know so some element of the
government is saying you have to do this
or else forget about your government
contracts it just feels like he's
underdressed because doesn't make sense
otherwise there's there's no argument
for it
otherwise anyway according to uh Harvard
Harris poll post Millennium is
Millennial is reporting that Trump's
approval rating have
54% with registered voters does that
sound real do you believe that Trump is
at 54% I've never heard of anybody at
54% has there ever been a president at
54% maybe Reagan for 10 minutes maybe
the first Bush for 10 minutes when he
went into
Iraq
54% do you know how crazy that is I mean
normal would be
35 to go from 35 to 54 I've never even
seen that I don't think I've ever seen
it you you can see it when a war
starts because it's just everybody
getting behind the leader but you don't
see it in you know before somebody takes
office that's crazy I wonder if it's I
wonder if that's going to be
repeatable I wouldn't be
surprised I I would say that if it turns
out that's a number and you see it more
I wouldn't be
surprised but I'm a little
skeptical Charles Barkley has some kind
of a podcast or who was on one I saw a
clip where he was uh he was mad at
Democrats he doesn't he doesn't call
himself a Democrat he's an independent
but he vote he voted Democrat and he
talked about how the the Democrats had
no policies and they were just trying to
use celebrities to get votes votes but
their messaging and their policies are
bad and he finally he just summarized it
all by saying quote you lost because you
all
stupid now he voted for
stupid I feel like you should get him a
shirt it says I voted with
stupid now here's what I need to add to
this uh you've heard me say it before
that Trump is unusually well tuned to
his base
at least the base you know the country
in general but the base for sure and
when the Bas changes its opinion he
immediately is alerted to it he
immediately takes it into his
consideration and often we've seen him
um you know pivot because the Bas said
uh uh uh that's more than we can handle
and then he pivots so Trump I would say
is the opposite of a you know strong
strongman dictator type he presents him
that he he presents that way to the rest
of the world and that's what we pay him
to do so of course we want him to look
like a strong leader to the rest of the
world but internally and by the way no
Democrat would know this that this is
something that all Republicans seem to
have had experience with we can almost
feel the the opinion of his
base influencing Trump in real time and
then vice versa I mean it's just so
connected the the connection between the
voters and the candidate is uncanny
really I've never seen anything like it
and so when I see Charles Barkley say
that the Democrats were stupid now I get
that he's not one of them because he's
an independent but he didn't vote that
way and here's what I would say if the
Democrats were not giving you the right
candidate and they were not giving you
policies and they were doing dumb things
like putting celebrities on instead of
whatever you thought they should be
doing like more podcasts for example
that's a little bit on
you the voters isn't
it if if Trump had made a whole bunch of
uh nominations that I
hated and he had so much time and we're
all watching and paying attention and
it's in the news I would say whoa whoa
whoa that's not just
Trump I the Bas has to explain why
they're okay with it cuz if the base was
completely not okay with something it
probably won't happen nomination wise so
to Charles Barkley I would say I think
you're halfway there um and I always I I
love Charles Barkley as just a public
figure he's just one of the most
entertaining you know genuine people of
all time I I'll watch Charles Barkley on
anything that doesn't matter what it is
if he's on I'll like okay I'm watching
so but I would like him to be open to
the idea that the base needs to support
the
candidate as much as the candidate needs
to support the Bas now I never would
have said that 10 years ago because I
didn't know it could work any other way
than the way it always works which is
there's a candidate and we watch
them but in the Trump
World the the public and the candidate
are just so connected that when one
moves the other moves and then they
they're guard rails to each
other anyway um so I won't go so far as
Charles Barkley did to say that
Democrats are
stupid because you know now that they
lost the election we would expect
obviously duh they're going to make
smart
Corrections so if they were
stupid they would just do the same damn
thing again all right I mean it's sort
of the definition of crazy so we could
count on them doing something changing
it
up uh so there's bre Bart is reporting
uh that there's new
poll showing uh who the Democrats want
for 2028 well here it is okay so so
here's the correction so their Top
Choice by far for a 2028 candidate was
uh Comm
Harris okay um she's got 41% and the
next best has 8% Gavin Nome Josh Shapiro
7% Buddha judge 6% Tim Walls
6% okay I take back everything I said
apparently Charles Barkley is just
correct they're just stupid and they
seem to be intent on running Harris
again how much do you love
that if you're a republican you're just
like you're probably probably thinking
you we we should start running a a prank
now to say how afraid we are that kamalo
would be the next candidate oh God God
no no not Kam Harris she's so
experienced she'll win this
time
yeah meanwhile Joy Reed says tulsy gabt
is in a religious
cult
nice nice Joy Reed now I I asked my uh
digital device what religion telsy
Gabbert is and I don't know what it is
so so some of it seems
uh seems to have a Hindu element to it
and some of it has some Christian
element to it I don't know but as Joy
Reed correctly said people's religion is
none of your business so I agree with
Joy Reed on that you can have any
religion you want in the United States
as long as long as you're not hurting
other
people
um
however why did you have to bring it
up what's the cult why do you get to say
your religion is a religion and my
religion is a cult who gets to determine
who the cult is and who isn't if you
have more people you're not a
cult if if uh
suddenly if Tulsi gabbard's uh form of
religion whatever it is if that became
the dominant one in the world and two
billion people were practicing it next
year would that make it a religion or is
it still a
cult when you see somebody call somebody
else's religion a
cult that that's such a red
flag for for craziness or
something anyway uh the so the Democrats
and the pundits who have been wrong
about literally everything for 10 years
have a new thing to be wrong about and
the new thing is that the reason that
Trump is picked Matt gates for attorney
general when he's so provocative and
he's so
controversial they say that the reason
is to uh and the intention and that it's
very well thought out this is not
accidental but the intention from Trump
is to humiliate and break the will of
any Republicans who still might oppose
him that's that's some of the best
thinking on the Democrat side that the
reason he wants Matt
Gates is so he can break the will of the
other
Republicans that might be one of the
worst opinions I've ever seen let me
explain it to you if there if there's
even one Democrat watching this which I
doubt why would Trump want Matt
Gates he's been lawed for what six years
how many years in a row has Trump been
lawed a lot the number one thing you
want is to put a pitbull in that job who
is loyal to you and that's it you need a
pitbull so if somebody picks a pitbull
and says I want my pitbull the one who's
going to be loyal to me but might bite
you in that job I would say that's the
perfect choice now it's not like he
doesn't have a law degree he's practiced
law he's been you know he's been in
Congress for a long time knows politics
inside out yeah he's the right person if
if I were Trump I'd be picking him and
the last thing I'd think about the last
thing I'd think about it wouldn't even
be on my list of
variables is what the other Republicans
thought about
it not I mean the Republicans that were
not already on his side because sure
enough all the ones who agree with him
anyway said okay I understand why you're
doing doing that makes perfect sense and
by the way if these were normal times
and Trump had not been targeted by these
very entities I don't think that Matt
Gates would be the right
choice I want him because he's the wrong
choice if you know what I mean like if
all you wanted was somebody to go in
there and just you know keep the lights
on you know just just keep things going
in a normal way probably you'd look for
somebody with more direct
experience but if you need somebody to
rip the out of this this completely
rotted
corrupt
garbage then I'll take Matt Gates all
day long right I I I need somebody who's
you know if if you want to get rid of
some uh pests in your house you want
somebody who can crawl under your
house you you don't want to somebody
who's going to walk around and say I
don't know seems like kind of scary
under the house so good luck now I want
somebody who's going to get in there and
do some damage damage meaning productive
damage I'm not you know I'm not for
chaos well I am enjoying and I probably
say this too often watching Scott J
Jennings you know the the lone often the
lone uh Republican voice on
CNN he is enjoying himself way too much
so part of the show is that he's
unusually good at communic ating you
know his side of things but what makes
it extra good is that he's so darn uh
likable and he can't get the smile off
his face especially when he's right and
he's like really really right which
happens often
so uh here here he was mocking the CNN
panel he said quote I'm amazed first
Biden now M and Joe everyone wants to
meet literally Hitler all the
pre-election Fascism and that talk from
Democrats was just BS uh if I were a
Democrat voter I'd ask did you just lie
to me for 6 weeks no come on
Scott the Democrats didn't just lie to
you for six weeks no it's been six years
Scott six years and yes the Democrats
have been lied to by their leaders
really lied to like super super lied to
for years and maybe they just figured it
out so I love the fact that you get
there there's there's no comeback to
this really I I haven't seen anybody
successfully answer the question if you
thought he was Hitler
yesterday why are you playing nice with
him today there is no answer to that
except we lied to you the whole time
there is no answer to that if anybody
had one they would have offered it by
now it would have been something clever
like well you know uh we got to do the
best we can to keep him in line and you
know but nothing they just they just act
like oh did that
happen well was I part of that I don't
know anyway Scott Jennings keep enjoying
yourself you're you're just I can't even
imagine how much fun that job would be
can you imagine how much fun he has
going to work knowing that the arguments
are just completely on his side you know
if you went in and the arguments were
sort of a tie you're like H I'm going to
have to I'm going to have to have my
best argument today otherwise I'm going
to get buried but you go in there like
like you just own the place because you
practically do uh that's got to be
fun well Al Sharpton is criticizing
Trump uh for not having enough black
cabinet
appointees let's see why why would there
not be enough
black
appointees whose fault would that be
Trump's
fault well it seems to me that if I were
a public figure who had been spending
years saying that if you were black and
you had anything to do with Donald Trump
that there was just something wrong with
you doesn't that decrease the number of
people who could potentially work for
Trump
I think uh Reverend Sharpton if you'd
like more black nominees which by the
way I would too uh I would also like to
see because there are a lot of
nominees right to get you know no black
nominees seems a little just looks weird
because that's not what the country
looks like however if you're if you're
saying who to blame I blame L
Sharpton because if L Sharp had been
saying for 20 years you know hey all you
Young Smart black guys you should become
Republicans because Republicans like
Merit so all you have to do to succeed
is do a good job you already know that
they want to have some diversity but you
can get it
organically how by complaining no no you
just have to be good at what you do but
also complaining right no no you don't
have to do that if you're a republican
if you're Republican you just have to do
a good job but also complaining no no I
swear to God you don't have to do the
complaining if you're a republican you
simply have to do the work and then you
you're up for promotion just like
everybody else so I think that blaming
Trump for the the lack of people who are
let's say willing willing to be
associated with Trump and also has the
right experience for these jobs
unfortunately there's not enough Supply
to fit the
demand let's see what Rob Riner is
saying
today um oh now Rob Briner says all the
abuse and hate from Twitter is now
spewed over to the Blue Sky Network so
there seems to be no point of it oh I
guess he went to the other network and
he found out that bad people can find
you no matter where you are trolls
good luck with that Rob Riner uh
meanwhile Trump has picked Dr Oz for to
be the Medicare and Medicaid service
Administration guy even John fedman who
ran against them and one uh said that he
would actually vote to confirm him he's
just concerned that he wants to make
sure that Oz doesn't want to cut the uh
Medicare and
Medicaid I don't know if he
does but uh you
know I I'm not going to stop saying good
things about Federman if Federman stops
keeps doing good things if he keeps
doing good things I'm going to keep
saying good things about him
and I don't know I think fedman is one
of the most amazing American
stories because when he had his you know
his mental
issues um
I certainly thought he should not be
running for office and by the way I
don't know that I was wrong about that
because we didn't know how it would turn
out if you don't know how it's going to
turn out it's a pretty big risk to put
on the public but the truth is maybe
they did know you maybe they knew more
than I knew and he's he seems all the
way back to me I I don't
see I don't see him missing
1% not only that but he's in the very
very very very small category of
Democrats who impress me with their
honesty name another one name the other
Democrat who impresses you with their
honesty I can't think of one so if he's
thinking about running for higher office
someday he might surprise you you know I
would not be surprised to see Federman
as the candidate for the next for
2028 what do you think do you think
Democrats are smart enough to do
that because I think they're going to
look at him and say damn it you're not
agreeing with 100% of what we say you're
not woke enough you don't wear nice
clothes how are we going to ever put you
on a Podium against some well-dressed
Republican I don't
know that guy has a lot of game uh
If he if he were the candidate in
2028 without even knowing who he runs
against you should probably be
worried because I've got a feeling that
the more the public sees of him the more
they like him that's been my experience
but I don't think most people are paying
attention uh he's a sleeper he's a
sleeper I'd watch out for him the of
course the problem is that he's not Dei
enough for the Democrats but maybe
they'll figure it
out anyway um the Democrats keep writing
articles about how Trump's going to get
his revenge on all the people who are
bad to him Trump doesn't say that of
course um he says his revenge is doing a
good job and that is the good Revenge
but uh Democrats keep saying that there
would be no guard
rails that Trump uh now has the let's
see the Supreme Court is saying he has
all these Powers while he's in office
and he's got the both the house and the
Senate and so and he's got something
he's calling a mandate but um hakeim
Jeffrey says it's not so the question
is the question is does Trump have guard
rails and again I'm I think this is a
blind
spot I think this is just a classic
blind spot it it's a complete
misunderstanding of what a republican
is the Republicans are the
guardrail all of them I just told you
that Trump is very tuned into the public
if if 70% of his base just said nope
like all at once whatever it was doesn't
even matter what the topic is nope no
70% nope that's not going to
happen and if you think that the Supreme
Court who who were chosen because
they're these originalists who are not
going to vary from the
Constitution if you think that the the
Supreme Court because they have a
majority conservative would allow Trump
to do whatever the hell he wanted
no no that's the opposite they would be
exactly the people to stop him if he got
outside the Constitution that's their
main function if if you're a Democrat
and you don't think the Republican
would stop Trump from from departing
from you know the Constitutional Norms
then you don't have any understanding
what the whole Supreme Court
Constitution Republic Republicans are
all
about yeah the supreme court is designed
by
Republicans mostly to stop any abuse no
matter where it comes from and it's not
going to be limited to just one
side so I think that the Republican base
and the Supreme Court
and just the normal the normal rules and
stuff that could be used in the Senate
and probably probably Trump has two
years before he loses the the house I
would guess so I think there I think
there are plenty of restrictions on him
and the only thing I would ever worry
about with an American
leader is if somehow he started
organizing a bunch of killers that were
loyal only to him so if you heard
tomorrow that Trump said I'm I'm going
to start a new uh I'm going to call it
my
revolutionary uh let's see I'll call it
my magga security force and uh there'll
be a 100,00 of them and there'll be
trained Killers but don't worry it's
just good for the country then i' I'd be
out it's like no no no no you cannot
have a bunch of trained Killers who are
loyal only to the leader that's how you
get Saddam Hussein that's exactly how
you get Saddam Hussein no as long as as
long as there's no organized military
group that would die for the
leader would and we're nowhere near that
you're fine you're fine the the rest
will work its way will work
out apparently the Doge people are
talking about maybe having a app for
your phone where you can pay your taxes
now that would only applied to people
who had you know basic tax situation uh
few paychecks and and a half house maybe
um but it should be pointed out that you
could already do it on a
browser so you don't need an app you
could still do it on your phone you just
have to use your
browser uh although maybe an app's
better um but I'd like to add this to
the conversation my understanding is
that Estonia has had a voting app for a
long
time and what we should do is ask the
estonians if that's been meeting their
needs and do they feel like it's fair
and everything so I feel like you could
solve uh voting
Integrity um with an app in a way that
almost nothing else could because one of
the things the app could do is make you
take a picture of your face when you're
voting suppose the app said all right
now you've completed your voting before
it's submitted uh turn your selfie
camera on and take a picture of your
face but don't wear a hat or
sunglasses because our our our facial
recognition now is so good that if it
was not a you know current picture and
it would have to know that it's a
current picture I
guess I don't think a deep fake could
fake that yet if it were a selfie
picture and it went directly into the
app I think I think you could avoid most
of the
problems all right what am I looking at
here I'm seeing a meme go
by that I want to look
at interesting all right so let's see
what Estonia has on voting
apps um Trump has announced a school
choice supporting Secretary of Education
Linda McMahon don't know much about her
but I saw Corey d'angelus say that it's
it's a good thing that we have somebody
who's a who's very much uh wanting to
send education back to the States and
also have some I think she wants that
and also to have a school choice school
choice is so
underrated I mean I I think if you could
fix one
thing in the country if you fix school
choice I feel like almost everything
else would work out it would take 20
years but if you could just educate
people well your your crime would go
down your GDP would go up your debt
would go down your basically everything
would work
better discrimination we
down well I guess there's a director in
the government the Pentagon director of
uh UAP phenomenon the unidentified
anomalous
phenomenon and uh that person testified
to Congress and it was largely useless
it was stuff like well there's this guy
who saw a
thing and there number of things we
looked into that weren't real but we
don't have an answer to that guy that
saw that thing and then there a couple
other people who saw a
thing how how does this guy have a job
would this be the best or the worst job
to have to be the director of looking
into uaps on one hand it would be
fascinating on the other hand I think
every one of them are fake
so you're either going to find out
they're fake and go oh darn it or you're
not going to be able to find out one way
or another so you failed so you're
either going to fail or find out they're
all fake it's sort of disappointing both
ways anyway so nothing came out of
that um I saw an opinion by Adam
dopamine on uh on the
xplatform uh and and uh Adam was saying
that uh the lame duck 3 months between
the transitions of power doesn't make
sense in the modern world and I thought
about it and I said to
myself wait a
minute look at Ashton Forbes it's not
fake now Ashton Forbes I'm not sure
that's your best
source he's got a lot of claims on there
that don't seem to be anywhere else
let's just say
that I don't know that he's wrong I just
I've seen a lot of his work and he has
more claims than I've seen any anybody
else make
so um you know you know the claims about
the little
orbs that like circled that plane the
Malaysian plane that went down do those
look like physical objects to you
because they don't to
me it to me it looks like it's either a
fake or I an artifact of the camera or
something none of it looks real to me
but I can be wrong I would love to know
that we've got real aliens anyway so
Adam doping was pointing out that uh
we're kind of in a bad situation between
the time we elect our new leader and the
time that the old one leaves because
Biden's doing some old man stupid stuff
he's he's basically getting us into
World War I and he shouldn't be doing
that he he should not have three months
to get us into World War III before he
leaves and dies
I think Trump should or whoever is the
new person should be taking the
Reigns maybe a lot faster now you do
need some
time you probably need at least a month
maybe we shouldn't include the holiday
in the middle of it you know you're
losing sort of a month to holidays so
maybe it's the wrong time of year as
well but I do like the
idea that we should at least look at
compressing that three months of lame
duck president to something that
protects us a little bit better I like
that idea I don't know how practical
that would
be all right I've got an updated opinion
on the Matt Gates ethics
report so allegedly there's an Ethics
report that's in a rough draft I don't
think it's done yet um that was going to
say that Matt Gates did bad things with
uh young
women but here's the the new thing I
want to add to
it everything that is suggested that he
did has been researched
by
um the justice department so in other
words authorities have looked in at
great detail every one of the claims and
did you notice that he's not indicted
for anything he's not indicted for
anything related to that or anything
else now why is this such a big story if
the people who would be the most
Authority on whether a crime had been
committed looked into it and found
nothing to
charge shouldn't that be the end of it
it would be one thing if nobody looked
into
it then I'd have questions but the
apparently the correct authorities
looked into it and came up with exactly
zero things that they were willing to
charge now reportedly the Witnesses are
not
reliable that's a real good reason not
to
charge but that also means that there's
not any written
documentation that would support the
witnesses who are not themselves
reliable so if you don't have a written
documentation and you don't have
witnesses that are
credible and they didn't even try for
indicting a ham sandwich you know the
old saying you know you can indict a ham
sandwich you you can almost always get
an indictment it's just really easy
getting a getting a conviction
serter but they didn't even get an
indictment
so I I feel like that should be the
standard that we're using for
this being accused matters until
somebody looks into
it but once somebody's looked into it
and it's the proper authorities the the
very people who are experts at looking
into this stuff and they say there's
nothing to
charge I think that's got to be the end
of
it and I think maybe that's the fastest
way to describe it you know when you're
trying to describe this to your
relatives over
Thanksgiving I think the strongest
argument is that it was looked at
thoroughly and authorities could not
find anything credible to charge it with
so we don't need to get into the details
of you know somebody claimed this or
somebody claimed that if you know the
people
who really know how to look into it
couldn't find it that should be the end
of it because remember innocent until
proven guilty so he was innocent and
then he was accused of heinous crimes it
was looked into they decided not to
charge him that's as innocent as you can
get you you can't get more innocent than
than people really looked into it and
didn't find it that's as innocent as you
can get now uh I'm not an idiot so I'm
not going to say he never did anything
bad because they didn't decide to they
decided not to take him to court doesn't
mean that but our system says if the
system looks into you and doesn't find
you guilty we call you
innocent and I'm totally on board with
that all right yeah it does seem like if
there had been anything there they would
have found a judge to pursue
it
anyway uh there are reports that are big
paper shredding trucks have appeared
outside the Department of Justice uh I
guess they're afraid of Matt Gates
finding out what they've been doing for
these many
years I'll bet you that there's a lot of
stuff in the Department of Justice that
is damning to the Department of
Justice so all right now here's the most
surprising story of the day Mike Ben is
all over this but apparently one of the
people being considered unless it's
changed since we've been talking is Mike
Rogers for FBI
director now he's not the only one being
considered I think cash Patel is being
considered as of the moment and by the
way this is something that could have
changed just since I started talking so
you know things are happening fast but
here's what Mike Ben
says he said you can you literally
cannot get worse than this if you give a
flying fig about free speech and I
thought what I don't know anything about
Mike Rogers what's this all about and he
said that Mike
Rogers um he was a Russia gate Pusher to
which I say oh
really if he believed and promoted
Russia gate that is that has to
be you know you you can't possibly put
that person in charge of the FBI but
there's more if there were no more I
would I already say that's that's a hard
pass I mean that that's almost like an
IQ test or a loyalty test or both if you
push the fine people hoax you tell me
I'm going to be okay with that as the
head of the FBI hard no that's a hard
now but we're not done yet apparently
he's on the board of directors of the
Atlantic
Council now that only means something to
you if you've been following the you
know the Mike Ben's description of how
the real world works and who's connected
to whom and where power goes after aent
of office the Atlanta Council would be
the the group that uses George Soros as
their bank and is the excia people and
the
ex-generals and some would say the real
power behind at least America's
projection of power into the world and
that this is the group you would least
want to pick somebody from
in other words if you said to me hey
I've got a good uh candidate uh and
before I even heard the person's name
and you said uh it's somebody who's a
board of director on the Atlantic
Council oh nope stop stop well I haven't
even told you the name yet you don't
need
to you don't even need to tell me who
you're talking about if they're on the
board of the Atlantic Council they have
a loyalty somewhere else that doesn't
look exactly like what I'd want in
charge of the
FBI and uh as Mike Ben points out
apparently he's associated with another
a number of other external organizations
they're very clearly CIA
connected so Rush gate seemed like it
was a CIA op and he was for it the
Atlanta Council looks like it's
basically an umbrella for CIA stuff and
he's a board of directors and then he's
associated with at least a few other
organizations that Mike BS points out
are famously
CIA kind of cutouts or associated with
now I'm not the expert on any of this
but um Mike Ben has a lot of
credibility if he says this is a hard no
then I say it's a hard no but my my
opinion is not based on Mike Rogers it's
based Bas on if you can't get this past
Mike
Ben this has got to
stop you got to stop this one right away
all right because the PE you know the
person who's actually watching what's
actually happening in the real world and
how it fits together if he says hard no
you can't you're not going to get it
past
me so here's a good little test what
does the um Republican base think of
cash
Patel they think a lot of him because
he's one of these truth to power do what
you need to do loyal to the president
super smart experienced in the
government I like him a lot you know I
only know from what I see in on the news
and interviews and stuff but I like them
a lot so if you've got a choice of
somebody that you like a
lot and then you've got somebody who is
so connected to the CIA who let me just
say it directly I don't know if they're
on our
side at the very least you would pick
somebody that you knew was on your
side I.E mad
Gates so here's one to watch so this
will be the
test if Trump picks Mike Rogers then I'm
going to have a lot of questions about
Trump like did he have to make some kind
of accommodation with the CIA in order
to do what he needs to do because that
might be a thing you know we we always
speculate that when a president gets
elected there's a point where the CIA
comes in and says we need to talk
everything you knew about the world is
wrong here's what's
real and you can't tell anybody now
here's what's going to happen I always
feel like that conversation must happen
but maybe it didn't happen with Trump in
his first term
because they didn't trust him so much
and they were trying to get rid of him
that rather than share with him the
secrets that they all bu hold they may
have kept those secrets and just tried
to get rid of them so if there's anybody
who's even tangentially related to the
CIA either through similar organizations
or or
anything I think that's disqualifying at
the moment only under a trump
Administration if it were different
Administration I wouldn't have a problem
with it but Trump
specifically this doesn't look good to
me so I just told you that Trump re you
know is very responsive to first of all
smart people Mike Ben and second of all
the
Bas so if he goes ahead and picks Mike
Rogers when I don't think the Bas is
going to support it but they would
support cash Patel then I have to wonder
if there's something we don't know about
out this would be a big problem to me
like I I I wouldn't I don't think I'd
ever be okay with
it you know you know what I
mean well here's a here's something to
make you feel great about your systems
in Oregon they have only vote by mail
but they also have a law that says that
if you've um put your vote in your U
envelope and you sealed it but you
change your mind you can open up your
your envelope uh change your vote like
scratch out the one you didn't want
scratch in the new one seal it back up
and tape it and it will still be
counted now if the reason for that is
that sometimes people change their mind
before they mail it okay I mean if
that's the only reason for it but
doesn't it make you think that that was
designed just for
cheating so basically somebody could
take a whole batch of ballots and they
can sit in the back room they can open
up every one of them they can change the
vote they can seal it back up with a
piece of tape and then the person
counting the votes will know that it's
been tampered with but could have been
tampered with by the original sender
which would be completely legal so
they'd count
it and sure enough they identified some
of these tampered with ballots
that they don't know yet but they
certainly look like they're fake in
other words it looks like somebody
opened it changed it just to change the
vote now I doubt that that would be I
doubt that they could make this a big
enough effect that it would change an
election because it feels like you'd
notice this it'd be it'd be just too
easy to
spot but it does tell you you got a lot
of holes in the system this one's
probably not the biggest hole but it's a
hole
according to Pennsylvania State
University in f.org
um they did a study and they found that
social media users probably won't read
Beyond this
headline there's more to the story but I
didn't read beyond the
headline do you know I didn't read the
beyond the headline about the story that
says people don't read beyond the
headline because sometimes
the headline is the whole story and you
can tell by the headline do you think if
I read this story about social media
users probably won't read beyond the
headline do you think that I would learn
that social media users probably won't
read beyond the headline and that there
would be nothing else that I learned
whatsoever that's what I think so I
didn't read it but meanwhile the splc
is going after uh not the be the the
parody site now if you don't know who
the splc is they are a highly
discredited Scandal ridden smear Factory
that's according to Seth Dylan of the
not the be and according to everybody
else who knows anything about them so
they're basically um I'll call them a
fake organization fake in the sense that
what they're supposed to be doing is
finding hate you know hate group and
calling them out what they really do is
act as a Democrat proxy to say that
Republicans are hate
groups now I'm exaggerating a little
bit but the problem is that they're
likely to identify you know
law-abiding um American citizens as
haters which ruins your career and your
life so they're a terrible terrible
organization they you know they're
discredited they're disgusted thing
they're horrible but now they've
apparently used some kind of um
sleuthing techniques to figure out the
names of some of the writers who would
otherwise be anonymous I guess on not
the be and it looks like they're going
to go after these writers
individually and this caused Seth Dylan
ahe of the not the be to go at the splc
quite hard
and um he is certainly in the right on
this so just so just so you've heard it
the Southern Poverty Law Center is a
discredited organization in the pre
pre-trump
world you could be forgiven for thinking
that was a serious
organization but there are too many
examples of them being not serious and
being more of a a attack dog for
Republicans that I would say uh
discredited and Scandal ridden would be
uh a fair
statement Rand Paul wants to kneecap or
get rid of uh cisa according to Politico
cisa so that's the cyber security and
infrastructure Security Agency so he
might want to downsize it or eliminate
it and that is the correct take because
they are also a discredited
organization and they're they're part of
that
disinformation Network you know part of
this you know hundreds of entities that
somehow are trying to protect us from
disinformation but really are probably
just Democrat entities to make sure
Republicans don't get fairly heard or
get in
trouble and then uh Last Story zero
Hedges reporting that according to a
Gallop poll public support for gun banss
is
cratered what would cause
that what would cause a
sudden reduction in
support for banning
guns did something happened I don't know
about because nothing really happened in
that domain right is it just because
Trump won that doesn't seem like
enough I'm going to say that I don't
necessarily think that poll is going to
be reproducible but we'll we'll watch
we'll find out all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all I got for today's
prepared reports thanks for joining
looks like the golden age is off to a
good start strong
start you think Owen you think it's just
because there's more crime it could be
may maybe just the fact that they're
Venezuelan gangs in 16 States or more
um that would be probably one of the
best reasons to know a gun but if a gang
comes to your house your one gun is
probably not going to keep you you
alive because it's a gang but anyway I
can see why people would have them all
right so I'm going to talk to the local
subscribers privately so I'm going to
say goodbye to YouTube and Rumble andx
thanks for
joining and I will see you same time
tomorrow because who takes time off
nobody not me see you tomorrow everybody
else in 30
