okay not too bad probably it'll
recover we're going to make sure we got
the comments all working here as you're
streaming on in for the best thing
you've ever seen in your
[Music]
life best thing you've ever seen in your
life stop it
that didn't work there we
[Music]
go good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time in your whole darn life but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even St with
their tiny human shiny brains all you
need for that is a cup or mug or glass a
tanker gel suin a canteen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine the end of the day thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
go so so good A lot of people people ask
me Scott what is the proper way to
consume your podcast well there are a
number of ways number one you can be
exercising right now if you are good for
you are you taking a run on the beach in
the morning are you lifting some weights
good good job alternately and just as
good you could have a cup of coffee a
blanket on your lap and one to two cats
yeah one to two cats that would be the
ideal way to watch the show alternately
if you have a
dog the dog can be sitting at your feet
while you sip your coffee and watch the
show so those are three ways to watch
the show all of them
recommended well there's a new study
cost is reporting part of the Bazar
cohort oh good it's part of the Bazar
cohort I was worried that it might be
data that was unrelated to the bazur
cohort but it looks like we're in good
shape here on this one and the data says
that caffeine might have a protective
role against Alzheimer's well again you
could have asked
Scott because I would not have forgotten
no I drink so much coffee that not only
does it cure my
Alzheimer's it cures yours
too it's true yeah that's how much
coffee I
drink um report edly the
xplatform that uh has been paying people
for the interaction in the comments so
if you were a large enough account and
you qualified you would get money from
Elon musk's a platform if a lot of
people interacted with your
posts but apparently that caused people
to game the system and uh create troll
accounts that were making it look like
they were getting interaction so they
could get fake paid paid but based on
fakes so now it looks like they're
getting changes so the only interaction
that you will get paid for is if premium
users interact so all the trolls would
have to either buy an account which they
won't do or go away or at least not be
included in the uh
calculation well there's another study
according to the medical Express the
reporting on it that loneliness can
increase your dementia odds by 31% % so
putting it all together drink more
coffee and be less
lonely and what will happen you have the
best odds of keeping your brain healthy
and what are you doing right now well
many of you are drinking a little extra
coffee because you're here with me the
simultaneous hip and you're also less
lonely cuz we get to hang out this is
why uh in the evening for for the people
who are subscribers to the locals
Community we hang out pretty much every
night sometime around dinner time and in
the California time and we just hang out
and because it's interactive and there
are comments going you know both ways it
kind of feels like a friend so I
literally sort of uh drifted into a
situation where I'm lots of people's
virtual friend now I wrote a book some
years ago and which I offered to be
anybody's invisible friend so I said if
you need an invisible
friend pick me I can be your invisible
friend if anybody asks hey are you Bob's
invisible friend I would say yes yes I
am but are you also you know Alice's
invisible friend yes I get around I'm
invisible and nothing slows me down but
now I can be your virtual digital friend
as well as your invisible friend so if
you don't have enough friends get an
invisible one or get a digital one I'm
here for
you and uh there's another study that
says people with dyslexia and dis
calula which is like dyslexia but for
numbers show less bias according to the
medical Express less bias this is why I
have less bias it's my dyslexia
I do have dyslexia by the way it's never
been diagnosed but it's it's so obvious
and extreme that uh it's hard to
miss my first job at a college was a
bank
teller and in those pre-computer days or
pre pre- small computer days um when a
customer would come in you would have to
write every transaction down on a little
side note so you'd write down like the
long string of numbers for their account
number or whatever so you'd have a paper
Rec of everything you did and uh how
many times do you think I got those
numbers reversed on my little paper
record yeah I was a disaster as a bager
didn't work out almost got fired but
instead of firing me they decided to
promote
me that's a true story by the way I was
on the verge of being fired because I
couldn't write down
numbers in in the same order in which
they appeared literally I couldn't
and uh so I'd gotten a couple of
warnings because my bank never balanced
at the end of the night it was a big
problem um but at the same time that I
was just about ready to get fired uh
another part of the bank was looking for
management
trainees and I got a management trainee
program so I got promoted instead of
fired that's a true story
anyway um
according to Neuroscience news uh people
are confident even if they only know
half of the story huh they needed to do
a study on that guess how they could
have saved a little
money they could have just asked me or
you really or really whoever was around
instead of doing the study you could
have just said hey hey stranger stranger
I got a question for you I was thinking
of doing this whole study it's going to
be expensive and time consuming but I'm
wondering if you can answer the question
instead
stranger um do you find that people who
are underinformative
well the good news is the study agrees
with every one of you every one of you
were right congratulations good job
every one of you got it
write um this was a study at Ohio State
University and I think the key learning
from this study is uh I wouldn't go to
Ohio State University apparently they
need to study things that everybody else
already
knew so I don't know what you're going
to learn there if it's the college or
the university for things that everybody
already
knew just kidding I'm sure it's a fine
establishment now of course the big big
news is that hurricane Milton is
slapping the country's penis you call it
Florida but you know live with it and um
here here are my comments on the
hurricane number one I would hate to be
in a disaster that was caused by a nerdy
named
hurricane what was it that destroyed
your house
Milton Milton come on we need scarier
names for these hurricanes if they're
going to be dangerous don't name it
after the guy you lock in your school
locker Milton hey get in my get in this
Locker
Milton all right well uh Comm Harris had
some comments about the her
um she was on one of the morning shows
she called in and she said I quote uh
the significance of the passage of Wind
unburdened by what has blown before no
I'm just making that up but it's so
stupid she could have said it it's not
more stupid than the thing she actually
says
meanwhile um there's a report from the
uh Florida's Fire Marshal that if salt
water gets in your um your batteries
your lithium ion batteries it could
cause a either immediate or slow ticking
Time Bomb so apparently salt water is
very bad for lithium ion battery
situations so regular water not so bad
but salt water will make your electric
car
explode now
I wasn't going to tell you this story
because I own I I have some stock in
Tesla but I feel like you know I can't
ignore this one
um this this is why I tell you what my
investments are in or I try to I try to
make sure you know what I've invested in
because it does bias you it absolutely
biases you there was a moment when I
looked at the story and I said to myself
huh this this story will be very bad for
my
investment but it is the truth so I
don't know how much of a problem that is
but if you've got a
Tesla uh I would uh drive it out of the
saltwater Zone if I were you if you can
get it out of there um I I would think
most people would have known that would
they if you had a Tesla and you knew the
salt water was going to be up to the car
level wouldn't you have made sure that
the way you left was in
that but I suppose it'll ruin all of
everything else you have
to Meanwhile there's a video of CNN
Anderson Cooper he likes to stand in the
storms and report and there was a piece
of debris that got blown at him and
whacked him so he got hit with
garbage um I don't know why that's
important but apparently it went viral
because a huge part of the public was
was quite delighted to see a CNN CNN
serson Cooper get slapped with
garbage what is wrong with us now he
didn't get hurt it it didn't look like
it was anything very heavy you know
maybe something light cardboard is but
he got slapped with
garbage I know there's something perfect
about that I'm glad he didn't get
hurt um there is the consumer price
index numbers out and so I did what I
always do I looked at the news and I
wrote them down and I was going to tell
you and then I saw that the news
reported it in two opposite ways one was
that it was down and one is that it was
up which one's true is it up or
down I literally saw a both this morning
but I was in a hurry so I didn't didn't
get a chance to run it down but it's
somewhere around what we
thought um so it's in that 23 24 range
but some specific things went up a lot
like like jewelry and watches are up
5% why are jewelry and watches up
5% can anybody tell me why jewelry and
watches went up in price now I don't
care about that one because you don't
have to buy jewelry and watches you just
don't have to so that one doesn't count
uh eggs are up
8% oh that one's bad uh college
textbooks right before College up 4%
Motor Vehicle Insurance up 16% food and
shelter
75% sporting event tickets up
11 but here's my question I certainly
understand why individual things will
move up and down because there are
different forces for different
Industries but can somebody explain to
me how our inflation level didn't change
much even though our national debt
changed a
lot is that possible
everybody's smart says the same thing
about
inflation the thing that causes
inflation is the government borrowing
money and basically creating money out
of
nothing so the government created a
whole bunch of extra money out of
nothing like over a trillion dollars
just this year and we're up to like 36
trillion were
approaching so if it's true that
increasing the money supply increases
inflation how can it be true that the
money supply was vastly increased and
inflation did not go
up what do we not
know am am I saying something
stupid is there a time lag because the
time lag should be all adjusted by now
you know there shouldn't be a time lag
at the moment because we've been adding
a trillion dollars of debt every year so
it's not like this is the first time we
added a trillion dollars in debt so how
could we add trillions of dollars in
debt and our inflation rate stayed about
the same oh wait a minute is there an
election coming up has anybody heard is
there an election
coming is this
fake is the inflation data just
completely
fake doesn't it have to be unless
there's something going on that would
make adding a trillion dollars in debt
not have any effect on your
inflation which would be
what I don't know so I guess uh my
bottom line is that all data that
matters is is
fake there's
a here's another another study so
somebody did a study to find out they
found out that
uh that women who applied for assistant
professor positions in North America
were more likely to get job offers than
men there was an actual study on this
all right let let's see what you would
have
guessed do you think they could have
saved some time and some money just by
asking
us who do you think's going to get the
job for an assistant professor ship in
North America the man or the
woman of of course it's the woman of
course who in the world thinks there is
any doubt about that now now let me give
you a hard one huh okay let's say it's
an assistant professor job and just
hypothetically we haven't studied this
somebody's going to need to study this
but Suppose there was a choice between a
white man and a black man equally
qualified same
qualifications let's do a study to find
out which one will be preferred in
20 24 no we don't have to no we don't
have to but here's the funniest thing
about the story is the title for the the
article right here's the title for the
article that found out that women are
preferred for assistant professor jobs
in North America okay here's the title
women are better than men at science job
interviews oh oh
oh oh come
on come on now here's the funnier
part the writer of the article has a
male name Chris so I'm guessing male do
you think that there's a a human male
who believes that the story for why the
women were preferred was because they
interview
better do do you think that the author
who wrote this really believes that or
is he just with us is that a
prank because it looks like a prank it
it looks like somebody wrote that
headline because they know it's
funny now by the way it might actually
be true that women interview better than
men that might be true but you know what
it doesn't matter they're still going to
get the job it doesn't matter who
interviewed
better it's 2024 the woman's going to
get the job
that's really the beginning and the end
of the story no it's because they
interview better there's no evidence
whatsoever that the interviewing better
is any part of the
decision-making like that's not part of
the study but but that was part of the
the the
headline all
right you know that the internet has
this uh internet archive it's called the
internet archive or the Wayback
machine and uh it basically tries to
store everything that had been on the
internet historically and now isn't
apparently they had some catastrophic
security breach that's their own word
catastrophic and at least this morning
the site was still
down and according to the verge um
they've got a note there that says they
were hacked now people you know what I'm
going to say you know what I'm going to
say you know I'm not a cyber security
expert but I don't think you have to be
to know this because all of you know
this why in the world would the internet
archive be using some cheap crappy cyber
security when all they had to do was use
the same cyber security that we used for
all of our election
systems so the next story is about the
uh
weather msnbc's Mike Barnacle
yeah his name is
Barnacle that's his actual name
Barnacle um he uh he didn't like the
fact that margorie Taylor green uh has a
theory that the government might be
manipulating the hurricanes and that the
government might be behind the North
Carolina hurricane Helen at least making
it worse or directing it and Mike
Barnacle says uh you have people in this
country who actually listen to her and
find some cred credibility perhaps and
something she says it's beyond belief
Beyond
description wow that's pretty bad it's
beyond belief and Beyond
description so he's one mad
barnacle and
uh here's my take on that so it looks
like we have a
standoff you've got MSNBC that believes
the government can control the climate
through climate change policy
and they're going against the people who
think you can't control the climate but
in some cases you can control the
weather so it's the people who think
that the government can control the
weather but not the climate versus the
people who think the government can
control the
climate but not the
weather to which I say well I do not buy
into the thought that the government is
controlling the weather so not on that
page
but um I did happen to look at the sky
yesterday where I live I'll let you take
a look at it and uh take a look at
this what the hell is this cloud
formation how do you get those
patterns uh I'm a little bit worried
that's Northern California how do you go
circular CL how does that happen have
you ever seen clouds form a ring three
rings what the hell is this cloud
formation how do you get those
patterns uh I'm a little bit worried all
right
so here's what I here's what I
know um you may not be aware that the
temperature where I live has been over a
100 for several days in a row over 100
degrees
probably starting to threaten our Energy
System because California is always sort
of on the edge of having enough energy
and when it's super hot that's the worst
it's also bad for forest fires and you
know you don't want too much heat
especially this time of
year at the same
time the clouds just sort of suddenly
changed one day so
yesterday yesterday the temperature was
down
20° I almost as much as 25° from what it
has been all
week at the same time these weird wispy
clouds came in that are not the kind
that I'm used to seeing all my life in
California and then I see some patterns
that don't even look like they're
natural patterns they look like I don't
know they don't look natural whatever
they are and I say to
myself is the government controlling the
weather in my neighborhood right
now cuz it looks like it I mean it looks
like it in every way cuz the cloud
pattern doesn't you the rest of the sky
also doesn't look like it normally looks
in California now is that just my
imagination I don't know it might be
could be my imagination confirmation
bias something like that I don't rule
that
out uh round clouds or cloud seeding so
I'm hearing that cloud seating does in
fact leave that
pattern so in the comments I just saw a
little article Somebody went by I don't
know if it's uh credible but a little
article that says the circular patterns
are a sign of cloud seeding now could it
be that the Bay Area just said well
we'll just see some clouds and take the
temperature down a little bit and
everybody will be better off I don't
know I don't know but I'll tell you one
thing when marjerie Taylor green says
the government is controlling the
weather there are two things I know one
you can of course control the
weather who thinks you can't control the
weather I thought we've been doing Cloud
seedings for like
forever Am I Wrong is cloud seeding my
imagination or have we not been actually
literally doing it I thought we were and
I thought that they've even
prototyped some uh climate change you
know reflective stuff they've at least
tested it so to me it looks like there's
100% confirmation that we can control
the weather and then of course the
government could if they wanted to now
if you can make it rain
more um does that
change for example the high pressure or
the low pressure If You Can Make It Rain
does that change the pressure I don't
know the answer to
that if it
did then you could steer hurricane could
you a little bit no now in my opinion
it's very very unlikely that somebody in
the government Unleashed a weapon of
mass destruction on the domestic
population so my brain will not allow me
to think that there's anybody evil
enough in our government who would do
something that they'd obviously
eventually be caught at um that would
kill you know tens of thousands of
people potentially so I don't believe
that but if MSNBC is trying to tell
Their audience that it's not a a
possibility uh I think you should look
at a speech that John Brandon gave where
he did suggest it's very much a
possibility uh I just don't think it's
being done so that's that's where we
disagree but I would give it not not a
0% chance we live in a world where there
are false flags and terrible behavior
and I can't take that odds to zero I
wish I could but I'll take it to
5% so MSNBC I'll slightly agree with Mr
Barnacle that it's unlikely that MTG is
correct that the government did it it's
not wildly crazy though I'll go that far
it's not wildly
crazy uh let's see what else is that
going
on we got got all kinds of news
today Michael shellenberger has
something like a scoop I think uh
there's a new whistleblower that came
forward and says the Pentagon is uh
holding information from withholding
information from Congress about the
secret uh UAP program you could call it
UFOs but we'll call them unidentified
aerial phenomenon I guess UAP and uh
there's even a name for this secret
program with these secret hidden uaps
it's called Immaculate
constellation and uh shellenberger uh
checked the credentials of The
Whistleblower and says that they're
quote
uh verified so he says he's verified the
credentials of The Whistleblower and
he's reached down to the Pentagon for a
number of days and they have not
responded
so now you've got your problem probably
one of if not the most credible
journalists working today who has
verified that The Whistleblower has
credentials and that The Whistleblower
is saying that oh yes there's definitely
hidden you know UFOs or something like
that
now what do you make of that story does
that tell you that we really do have
UFOs well again not going to rule it out
um I would say it's at least 95% chance
we
don't but there is there is a
whistleblower there are multiple
whistleblowers and uh shellenberger is
our in my opinion our most credible
journalist partly for by being
independent and partly by being right
about everything for years so he he
basically he one of the few people in
the business who has you know no stains
on his record
so you've got you've got an argument in
both directions one is it seems like on
its on its surface it seems like a
hugely unlikely thing that we have some
hidden UFOs and by the way when I say
UFO I would include a hidden
civilization of a you know under the
ocean or whatever doesn't doesn't mean
it came from another planet could be
anything but it might be secret and
futuristic and high technology
but I'm going to say less than 5% chance
this is real here's the thing I'm
worried about do you remember the
Kraken you remember when Sydney Powell
in 2020 was saying uh not only is the
election rigged but we've got a
whistleblower uh and the Kraken is
coming now the Kraken was an imaginary
monster which was just her way of saying
that there was going to be a really big
and true story about election cheating
now as it turned out the Kraken the idea
that there was a
Venezuelan software machines that Were
Somehow rigged did not pan out did not
pan out and so we're left with the
question where did that information come
from who gave her the information who
was so credible
credible that she would believe it now
remember Sydney Powell is not you know
somebody's fool she's somebody who's
worked in Washington forever at the
highest levels seen behind every
curtain if somebody who would be that
naturally skeptical and cynical about
the world you know somebody who really
knows what the real world operates like
found this story about the Kraken to be
credible and what did that do to all the
claims about election security it just
destroyed them because it took the
strongest player off the field when if
you were watching ing the story
developing you said to yourself oh
Sydney Powell's got the goods she's
credible she's very credible and she's
got the goods and then they took her off
the
field by proving that it was a fake
story or one she couldn't
prove and I said to myself you know what
that sounds exactly like an intelligence
op that somebody would pick somebody
credible and have the credible person
working up to tell the strongest player
on the field something that will later
be debunked and ruin their credibility
for the rest of time so to me it looks
like the Kraken was an OP now
interestingly I've never heard anybody
ask or seen Sydney Powell describe where
she got that information because I think
you would find that whoever it came from
might have some passing connection to
the security state if you know what I
mean just a guess you know maybe in
another country but also connected with
our you know State Department or CIA or
something so I worry that that's an
existing play that is one you would see
more than
once it's a sort of thing
where person like me who has a a voice
might get canceled for example and you'd
say to yourself oh that was just a
naturally occurring
thing was it
I don't think so maybe but was it or was
it conveniently taking a strong voice on
of the market or attempting
to so then I look at this latest
whistleblower and we've got an election
coming up and we've got shellenberger
being um I won't say he's right leaning
because he you know grew up as a
Democrat and he's seen both sides so
he's unusually good at seeing the whole
field un usually good at
communicating unusually good at getting
attention and unusually good at getting
Scoops how badly do they want to take
him off the
field really badly I I would imagine he
would be right at the top of the list of
people they'd want to discredit if they
could find a way what would be a good
way to do it well one way would be to
send him a fake whistleblower so he's
out there saying that they're real UFOs
and we're distracted and then someday if
it falls apart they'll saywell why do
you ever listen to that shellenberger
guy he got that UFO thing
wrong so I'm worried for for
Michael that uh there might be an OP
going on here just a suspicion
so Michael shellenberger I would advise
you to
uh to maybe couch this in less
definitive terms as in to say there is a
whistleblower but we cannot tell if it's
credible that would be cleaner I I don't
think to say The Whistleblower has now
convinced me that this is
real is the way to go I think he needs
to just just protect the credibility a
little bit more so and by the way I
don't think he's I don't think he's
definitively saying it's true I think
he's reporting the facts
but I would be really careful to make
sure you put a little distance between
yourself and those
facts just be
careful well as you know uh we keep
hearing from Democrats that crime is
down but our lived experience is the
opposite crime is up where I live and I
live in a safe place so if it's up here
I don't know what it's doing in other
places but in New York City apparently
the former Governor David patters
who was not only the first black
governor in New York but he was the
second blind governor in American
history so he was walking his dog with
his stepson and he was uh attacked by a
group of uh adults and teens who knocked
them down and kicked them now I saw the
video
and uh of course it's terrible that they
knocked a blind guy down and kicked him
all right it's pretty bad but there are
some positives to it uh apparently it
was a group of uh Hispanic and black
kids and I thought oh well two groups
getting along so you know at least
you've got that and then the second
thing was if you saw the kicking that
they were very bad
kickers that they were they were kicking
him while he was down but it it looked
like they're just sort of tapping them
with their shoe I've never seen weaker
kicking
so it looks like maybe the criminals are
just getting weaker like ah we're going
to need like 20 of us and we're we're
lightly kicking you we I touched you
with my shoe so I'm not saying they I
would have been happy if they kicked
them harder of course not I'm just
saying that the criminals seem to be
getting weaker that the the kicking was
totally under well you have to see
it meanwhile Trump went on a podcast
with a comedian uh Andrew Schultz um who
by the way for the record is an
he's an Andrew Schultz I say
that because he threw me under the bus
when I got cancelled um he's not very
bright uh he's got a porn
mustache um he's sort of low IQ he has
sort of the low IQ
uninformed podcast but because they're
guys and they're you know funny and
irreverent it was sort of a perfect
place for Trump to go I've never seen
him so comfortable Trump is so
comfortable in every situation now I've
said too many
times that the superpower Trump has is
oneon-one or in this case one on several
but same thing he his ability to work a
small group and work in individual you
know at the retail level where it's you
know you're right in front of them is
unequal and it's something that KL
Harris can't do at all she doesn't have
any social skills that don't look super
awkward or staged and he's he's maybe
the best we've ever seen it it's hard to
come up with any politician who could
walk into any every situation from you
know meeting with the heads of state to
this
podcast and act like he's been there all
you know all his life he's just so
natural anyway he was hilarious
um and he made some good cracks about uh
Biden everybody laughed like
crazy
um he said Biden has an ability to fall
asleep on camera he can be there and
within minutes he's stone cold out they
have cameras on him and he's asleep
you'll never see me sleeping like that
they talk about what he's packing under
his bathing suit Biden and then he does
his favorite little thing about Biden at
the beach he goes Biden has one ability
I don't have he sleeps
his only ability is he sleeps this guy
goes to a beach he lays down in one of
these 6 o chairs he can't even lift them
they're meant for children and old
people to lift he can't lift them now
I've heard him say that a bunch of times
and it's never less good it's never less
good yeah oh and then he he told a Don
Jr
story that apparently Schultz had heard
uh that Don Jr once when he was young uh
through a big party without permission
in you know on the roof of a Trump
building and Trump came back home early
he was supposed to be gone and uh kicked
everybody
out and then Don Jr spent 36 hours like
cleaning everything up like it never
happened and and the story is that um
according to Don
Jr uh Trump never talked to him about it
so Trump came home kicked down 200
people people didn't tell Don Jr to do
anything but Don Jr spent 36 hours
cleaning because there's nothing scarier
than hearing nothing from
him and the the joke was that to this
day Trump has never said one word about
it and and uh don Jr heard the story and
then on X he confirmed that that it's
true and he said the worst punishment he
ever could have gotten was that uh his
dad never mentioned it he it was like
torture
[Laughter]
and
then and then when Schultz asked him
like you know was he ready to like
forgive him Trump said
no he goes some he goes no some things
you don't
forget I was like Wow
Wow but it was
funny anyway um so here's my question
I've seen KL Harris was on that call me
daddy
podcast and it was kind of a
uninformed you know podcast and she went
on The View and you know the view is
like famously the dumbest people in
TV and uh quite a few dumb people and
you know the Schultz podcast I've
watched it enough to know it's it's
basically dumb guys they're funny but
they're dumb guys they don't know a lot
about politics but they still have
opinions um however I saw that chartable
which which tracks podcasts had a list
of uh the the biggest right leaning
podcasts now listen to the names on this
podcast the the top right leaning
podcasts now I don't know what are the
top left leaning podcasts because if
they're about entertainment and stuff it
wouldn't be on this list but do you
think they have the same qualifications
so I'm just going to read you the names
of the top podcast on the right and you
tell me if these sound like serious
people or are they like Andrew Schultz
and call me daddy in the view all right
number one Megan Kelly Two Tucker
Carlson three Dan banino four Charlie
Kirk five Matt Walsh I'll just go down
the rest Glenn Beck Mark lvin Michael
nolles Bill O'Reilly Dave Rubin Ellie
Stucky Steve de Jesse Kelly and number
14 Scott Adams I guess number 14 on the
list
now um you know you you could maybe have
some arguments with a few people on the
list but those are really well-informed
people Am I
Wrong everybody on this list is at the
very least they're smart they've been
doing it a long
time and they're well
informed there's a big difference
between what the right and the left are
listening to now now to be fair chable
might have a a list of the political
left that would be more serious than the
entertainment left so they might maybe
they have some names that I would
respect on their list but
it's it's kind of
um it's kind of interesting that the
people who get the most attention on the
right are very serious people now I
would like to boost Myself by saying
that of the 13 people who are above me
on the list most of them are connected
with an
organization so they have like a big
operation you know um so of the people
who do nothing but turn on their
computer and talk to
you not bad to be in the top
14 my my entire investment is I I have a
computer and a microphone and I'm in the
top 14 of right-leaning political
podcasters that's the world you live in
it's just wonderful that that's even
possible anyway a Newsweek opinion
writer uh baa Angar
Saran uh is reporting that
uh well she had a good reframe she said
that the Harris campaign is based on
madeup problems whereas the Trump
campaign is based on real problems and I
thought to myself what madeup problems
what the hell is a madeup problem well
here's an example Trump's going to steal
your democracy is that real or just a
madeup problem that's a madeup problem
he's definitely not going to steal your
democracy how about climate
change well you know you could argue
whether there's a base truth to the
science but certainly the way we're
handling it is sort of on a whack with
what it is so seems like it made up
problem in to some degree not
100% uh how about all the division in
the country so the Democrats create
massive division in the country and then
they run on solving the massive division
in the country that they created that's
a fake all they have to do is stop doing
it they don't need to solve it just stop
creating it if you stop creating it you
won't have anything to solve so I would
say those are fake problems and and then
of course they've also got they have
some goals that they shouldn't
have I'm adding this part it's one thing
to have fake problems you're you're
offering to solve and it's another
thing to have goals that you say you
want to do that you shouldn't even have
that goal such as Equity so Equity is
one of the things they want to solve
they want to achieve and that would be a
terrible idea if you were to succeed at
getting Equity would be the end of the
United States for sure I mean no doubt
about
it um so there's that but then you look
at the real problems you got the debt
problem the depopulation problem the bad
education problem and to be honest I'm
not sure Trump's doing enough on any of
those but at least they're real at least
they're real Trump does have uh
something like a plan on the debt you
know growth will make a difference
growth in the economy but also if Elon
Musk goes in and starts cutting
government expenses that might be the
only way you could ever get to you know
the debt under
control I don't know that Trump's doing
enough about depopulation but he's not
doing anything against it he's in favor
of IVF for example and I don't think
Trump's doing enough on education he
wants to get rid of the Department of
Education and move it to the states I
don't know if that helps you know it
might it might make sense in some
budgetary constitutional way um I don't
know that that's going to solve any
problems I don't know and uh one and4
Millennials and gen Z's say they won't
have kids due to finances according to
CBS um if that's true if one and a four
of the people in the reproductive ages
don't want to have kids because they
can't afford it that's sort of the end
of the
country you realize that
right under normal times that would
guarantee that your country's dead you
know you'd have one two generations left
and then you'd just be in trouble
because you wouldn't be able to support
the old people there's not enough young
people I mean it it' just all fall
apart uh however
coincidentally the we reach this point
where people don't want to have children
at exactly the time that you can buy a
robot is right we might be a year away
from actually buying a robot for your
house so no joke I do think robots are
going to replace
children uh not a one for one
replacement but people working on
loneliness and meaning and just wanting
to have a connection if the AI gets a
little bit better I can't do it yet but
if it gets a little bit better I wonder
if it can actually people make people
feel less lonely could you ever get to
the point where your
robot was a source of
oxytocin oh this is interesting so
oxytocin is that uh that chemical in
your body that's produced when you have
good Human Relationships especially if
you're touching somebody you like and
generally speaking you can't get that
from a robot because you don't have any
sense of
touch but is that
unsolvable you remember those studies
where there were little baby monkeys
that were orphaned and they would give
some of them a warm water bottle and the
little monkeys would hug the warm water
bottle and they'd have a much better
outcome because the warm water bottle
was something like hugging a mother
I wonder if you could make a
robot that had some kind of a surfacey
area that could be warm enough that if
you spoon your robot you would get
oxytocin so imagine your robot spooning
you it's warm like a like a nice warm
blanket and it's soft so it have to be
softer than a metal robot and it's
saying good things to you like you're
you're all curled up at the end of the
day and say how's your day today oh it's
not bad you know have you uh have you
done your exercise yet yeah I just got
done I I'll bet that feels
good Could you actually get oxytocin
from a robot if if the robot was
designed specifically to produce it you
know an ordinary robot in no way but if
it were designed for
it I don't
know I my instinct says yes and if you
can get oxytocin from a
robot then the population is really in
trouble or not you know maybe the robots
are better than
kids anyway CBS has been asked for the
unedited video of the Harris interview
uh Katherine herriage is pointing out
that there's some uh there's some
precedent for asking for full
unedited U videos of
interviews and
uh how bad do you think the unedited
video is the CBS doesn't immediately
give it to you
how bad is
it let me let me make a working
assumption my working assumption is this
you will not see the unedited video
before the election do you know why you
will not see the unedited video before
the election if they're holding on to it
and they had to edit it that badly just
to make it look like a
 just imagine how bad that is just
imagine how bad that is because you know
know the CBS had to know when they made
those major illegal or inappropriate
edits they had to know there was a high
chance of getting caught so how would
you like how bad was
it that 60 Minutes this this uh highly
you know respected entity for decades
and decades my whole
life they threw away their
credibility to help Harris
how bad was it that they had to throw
away their entire history to protect her
it had to be really really really bad as
in so bad it would change the result of
the
election I think it's so bad that it
would be the end because otherwise they
would have said oh you're right you know
we'll show you you know Mia kpo we're
sorry uh it was a low it was a staff
member who did it it wasn't Senior
Management we've already fired the
person who did
it right but they don't do that and it's
been days and it's a major Scandal and
they're not even
replying I think they're just going to
sit on
it because nobody can really make them
show it so they'll just try to write it
down I
think so uh I think you I think you'll
find that
uh you'll find that to be on the list of
things we're not allowed to see so we're
not allowed to see the full transcript
of the 60 Minutes interview of KL Harris
we're not allowed to see the Epstein
Client List that Diddy tapes the FBI
attendees at January 6 we don't know
what's up with that we don't know who
owned the coke at the White House
they're not going to tell us they're not
going to look into it we don't know
about the UFO stuff is it real or not we
don't have the JFK assassination files
yet we don't know about the Assassin
attempted assassin krook's phone and is
encrypted apps that seems to be
something we'll never find out and we
won't know why the other attempted
killer Ruth had several phones and what
was that all
about so it it turns out that the thing
we used to call the
news is part of the thing that keeps
information from you they don't seem to
be in the news business do
they they seem to be very much in the
preventing news business because if they
were in the news business they would say
every day hey why don't we have this
stuff because it's what people really
really want to know but
instead they cover the
wind so yeah I think the news is in the
coverup business at the
moment uh one of the things that I'm
looking for and predicting is that if
the polls turn massively bad for Harris
you're going to see the the media that
supports her slowly turn as well so in
other words the media the left leing
media won't throw her under the bus but
if she's already under the bus and
there's no way she's getting out the the
media is going to want to act like they
were always a little on both sides so
what you should see is that as the polls
turn so negative that Harris can't
possibly win you should see the entities
that supported her maybe working a
little criticism just a little bit of
criticism so
axios who uh I would consider left
leaning um is on Harris today
and I said to myself huh would that
happen if she were aheading the polls do
you think axios would crap on Harris if
she were like looking like she were
going to
win maybe maybe but I think it's far
more likely if if they've decided she
can't possibly win that they're going to
make sure they've got a few negative
things in there to remain looking
credible so here's what they said
today so you've heard this story but
just the fact that it's mentioned again
in axios that of the 47 Harris staffers
that were listed in 2021 only five still
work for how bad is it to work for
somebody if only five out of 47
basically 10% have lasted 3 years and
that's not been the same with other
people
um and then there's a report in same
article in axios that Biden hesitated to
drop his re-election campaign because he
didn't think he and his senior advisers
not just Biden but also his senior
advisors thought that Harris couldn't
win and uh axios also notes that it took
a while for uh for Obama and Pelosi to
um back ARIS
which suggests that they weren't so sure
she was the right
choice so now that would mean that Biden
Obama and Pelosi didn't think that
Harris was the right had the right stuff
to win who on the left knows more about
Harris and her capability than Biden
Obama and
Pelosi now based on what we've seen in
public of
Harris how bad is she privately
behind closed doors she must be a total
train wreck do you do you know the
stories about Trump when people say oh
Trump's a you know just a wild mess
behind closed doors and then what would
you hear immediately you would
immediately hear people who actually
spend time with him saying um I actually
spend time with him and that's not the
case he's actually very engaged asks the
right questions uh shows interest talks
to a lot of people gets a lot of
opinions
so when when Trump gets that treatment
that he's crazy man when you're not
watching there's always somebody who was
really there and lots of them who say
that's not
true but are we getting that from the
Harris campaign is there anybody in the
Harris campaign who's saying you know
honestly she's great to work for she's
getting a bad rap and sure there's
there's turnover but it's because she
hired such good people that they got
they immediately got job offers that
were even better so really they just got
promoted they didn't leave because she
was
bad right wouldn't you hear something
like that you'd expect the Insiders
would be saying what are you talking
about she's great to work for we all
love working for her nope I haven't
heard a have you have you heard any
reports where people are debunking the
fact that she's a in private
nope nobody yeah I I have heard a few
people who are obviously on the campaign
say it but uh in the Trump case it's not
campaign staff who say it it's just
anybody who's worked with them I say it
right I spent you know 20 minutes half
an hour chatting with him once and he's
really engaged he he genuinely asked me
questions and showed complete interest
in the answers and the opinions even
when he didn't agree with me so he
didn't agree with
everything uh anyway so watching the
watch for the media CNN is being a
little tougher on Harris as well so
those are the leading indicators MSNBC
won't because they're not real news
MSNBC is more like a pretend News
Network they're basically a full-time
propaganda network uh for the
Democrats so don't don't count them as
part of the news atmosphere because
they're really
not
um so just an update on the uh January 6
fed involvement as you know Direct Ray
would not say if there were any FBI
informants or anything involved in it um
but he did say if you're asking if the
violence was organized by FBI sources or
agents the answer is
no what he didn't say is how many were
there um and uh if he's not willing to
say how many were there then I'm not
sure I'm going to totally believe that
none of them were involved in making it
worse and there's some question about
the ghost
buses I don't I don't fully believe the
ghost buses story but the idea is there
were some buses painted white which
means all the identifying markers were
removed do have you ever seen a bus that
was completely white I've never seen one
but there were two of them on January 6
that allegedly may have carried two
buses full of FBI I uh undercover people
now if there were two buses
full so as more than one Bus full how
many how many people fit on a
bus
50 50 or
60 how many rows on a
bus probably 15 rows two on each
side yeah so we're somewhere north of a
100 people
so whoever was on those buses maybe 100
you know maybe maybe 60 to 100 people
something like that if you had 60 to 100
FBI informants and agents in the
crowd could Christopher Ray be sure that
all of them were doing just what they
should have been
doing or
because um
because Christopher Ray's answer may
have suggested that he was talking for
the FBI organization and not necessarily
answering to what any individual who may
or may not have been there did so
there's a possibility that there were no
orders to do anything to make it worse
but that there were some
members who may have and maybe maybe
were not privy to that so I don't know
what to believe about this but uh it
seems like if those ghost buses
were for somebody else by now wouldn't
somebody else say it if you knew it was
a national story that your two white
painted buses were still a mystery you
don't think that the person who are the
people who were on the bus or the bus
drivers or anybody else who knew they
were like innocent buses you don't think
that somebody would say oh wait a minute
that that was my bus no no it's not a
ghost bus it's just a bus we rented to
bring people here for whatever reason so
the fact that you haven't heard about
the
bus I feel like somebody would have said
that was my
bus
right so because it's the government I'm
going to assume the
worst uh they are not transparent so
when the government is very
intentionally non-transparent you should
assume the
worst doesn't mean you're right but you
have a right to assume the worst under
those
circumstances well uh you know there's a
story that Trump had several phone calls
with Putin since he's been out of office
uh which some people say Susan Rice said
this that he might have violated the
Logan act now the Logan act says that if
you're not the elected representatives
of the country you should not be doing
any negotiating with other
countries but in the entire history of
the world the Logan act has only rar L
been enforced only two people ever been
charged one was 1803 and the other was
1852 and neither were prosecuted so
there's been zero prosecutions in the
history of the Republic for the Logan
act but we we like to trot it out to
make the other side feel uncomfortable
now I think uh I think Trump had said
that Biden had violated the Logan act or
or John krey did oh John KY because KY
was talking to the Iranians
um I can I can see why the Logan act
exists but I don't think anybody
cares I suppose it were true that Trump
was talking to Putin in a way that
somebody could construe is negotiating
well you know he didn't negotiate
anything
specific I I can say that for sure
there's no way in hell that they
negotiated anything
specific but if Trump says in public
every single day you know I think we're
just going to have to end this war and
work it out with something like the way
the Border looks now it if he said that
to Putin and there's no evidence he did
if he said that to Putin would that
sound like negotiating or would he just
be saying to Putin what he says in
public and what everybody else says so
I'm not exactly sure where that line is
where are you negotiating and where are
you just saying your opinion like
everybody says their opinion and he does
it in public all the time I don't I
don't know but I can't imagine this
would be
prosecutable well let's do an update on
the polls which are all
squirly uh CNN says Clos people close to
the Harris Camp saying that worried
about a 2016 event where the polls are
undercounting Trump supporters and he
wins in the end so CNN's starting to
hint that maybe the polls are not really
telling a story that's good for Harris
at the same time and they're talking
about nothing she's doing is moving the
needle uh political analyst Mark
helin um said this week that uh both his
Democrat and Republican contacts believe
Trump's uh chances of wining winning are
looking strong and getting
stronger because he's seen a private
polling so the people who have seen
private polling
uh that's stuff that usually candidates
have done so that they can have secret
information that the other side doesn't
have but the private polling apparently
suggests that Trump's in a commanding
position and then uh quinac polling came
out today showing that Trump is add in
Wisconsin and Michigan that's reported
by just the
news and if that's true and there are
other reports that he's he's dominating
this swing States
Etc so what's the date
today it's uh the 10th October 10th what
did I tell you was going to happen in
the middle of this month which would be
five days from
now I think I told you that the polls
would have to start chewing up why would
it be the middle of October because the
beginning of October is too soon the end
of October is too late and the middle of
October is sort of a um it's like
picking an even number right if you're
going to say something's going to happen
in in any given month you're usually
talking you know beginning middle or end
so if you ruled out the beginning and
the end and you thought things were
going to happen people would probably
shoot for the middle because we're just
we're just biased toward those um points
right not a reason there's not a reason
we're just biased toward you know clean
start points beginning middle end so my
prediction has been that October 15th 5
days from
now the polls will
collapse you might see it a little bit
early in a few polls but by the
15th I'm expecting a total collapse in
the Harris numbers it's going to happen
fast and then people are going to look
for some reason and and they might
saywell I guess it was that 60 Minutes
report or they're going to say uh she
didn't take our advice to do more
rallies you know she was doing podcasts
ah we told her not to do
that so 5 days until total
collapse of all the polling for
Harris by October
16th there will be nobody in the news
who thinks she's is likely to win she
could still win I'm not saying she's
going to lose because there's lots of
shenanigans that are part of the story
so the shenanigans are hard to you know
rule in or rule out we don't know what
that's going to look like but there will
be Shenanigans maybe totally legal maybe
maybe something under the color of law
or something not but there will be
shenanigans that we're not going to have
a shenanigan free election that's for
sure but I do think that by the
16th uh Trump will be generally
considered the
dominant um
player if you've been listening to Mike
Benz and you should by the way if you're
not listening to Mike Benz you really
don't know what's
happening you you just have to follow
him if I could tell you there's one you
just have to follow it's Mike Benz you
have to follow him you just won't
understand anything you're seeing in the
news News until you do and one of the
things he teaches us is that the first
amendment has disappeared so we don't
actually have a First Amendment in any
practical sense we have it on paper but
not in the practical sense because the
government found that it could suppress
free speech
by calling it
disinformation oh no we're not
suppressing your free speech we're just
trying to reduce the disinformation
that's oh so dangerous and the way they
do it as Mike Ben will explain in
infinite detail if you want to listen
and it's all interesting by the way um
so the US government Democrats
mostly have uh sent tremendous amounts
of Monies to
universities to put together programs to
spot
disinformation what do you think
disinformation is well disinformation is
anything that disagrees with Democrats
sometimes they're right sometimes
they're wrong but mostly it's about what
disagrees with
Democrats so that's
disinformation now disinformation is not
illegal so how do you you know what's
the difference if you spotted it well
then the people who have spotted the
disinformation in their opinion the
people who took the money from Democrats
and are also Democrats they've decided
that oh there's some disinformation
coming from that Scott Adams account on
x
so then the government says oh we've got
an official report of that Adams guy
with some disinformation so we're going
to go to the xplatform and say hey can
you do us a favor we're finding all this
dangerous disinformation from this Adams
guy can you uh kick him off the platform
or can you you know maybe suppress them
somehow now on the xplatform as far as
we know since Elon Musk has been in
charge uh that would be a no and no
we're not because our platform doesn't
do that but if they ask Facebook or they
asked Twitter in the past or they asked
Instagram or they asked anybody else
would they
likely agree with going along with the
oh we have to suppress these voices
because they're
disinformation so as long as you have
disinformation as your substitute for
free speech you can make all forms of
free speech go away for your people you
want it to go away for simply by having
your paid puppets label it
disinformation so they've actually built
an entire elaborate many many millions
of dollars across I don't know dozens or
hundreds of organizations maybe hundreds
that are all in on this large
suppression of
disinformation
stuff
so here's what we've got so then uh in
that context uh Biden comes out and he's
blaming Trump for
spreading what
disinformation so suddenly Biden says
that Trump is lying about FEMA he's
spreading
disinformation so what he's saying is
everybody who's on the the team that
doesn't like disinformation you should
start you know suppressing anybody who's
spreading it so this is sort of a
message to anybody who's sort of on that
suppression team that if Trump says that
the FEMA funding is insufficient because
money went to help
migrants then uh Biden and the Democrats
will simply say that's not free speech
even though what he's saying holds
together they could argue that it's
technically untrue because budgets are
in different bags but in the real world
any budget can be made available to
anything as long as everybody involved
agrees that's just way everything works
if everybody agrees or the people in
charge agree you can move money from one
place to another so yes if you're out of
money in one
bucket but still spending it in another
bucket it is perfectly reasonable to say
that your money is going to somebody
else now is it technically true it
doesn't matter it's true in the real
world yeah money is fungible exactly if
you don't know what the word fungible
means you should look look it up yeah
there there's some things that you know
they they can move everywhere and
they're the same money is like that you
know the money in my pocket is the same
as money in your pocket it's not like
better money if it's the same
amount so it's fungible you can move
money from one place to
another all right
um and apparently CBS has refused to air
a trump political ad that's about uh
Kell Harris being in favor of gender
affirming care for
minors now this Jeff Charles from Red
state is reporting on this
and do you think the CBS should be
allowed to turn down a political
ad
um oh wow I'm seeing a new rumor there's
a new rumor that says that Tim wals has
been diagnosed as clinically bipolar all
right I'm just seeing that on some
random account on X so I would give that
zero
credibility yeah I shouldn't have read
that I should have checked on that
before I set it down loud so unless does
anybody have a source for that I'm going
to give that zero credibility unless
there's some
Source all right yeah don't ignore that
take it back I apologize for even saying
it I shouldn't have said that I should
not have read it just because I saw it
in in a comment that's not
fair all right so I'm chastising myself
I'd like you to erase your memories of
the last 30
seconds um here's some good news uh you
know I I may have told you or posted on
X that Arizona seemed a little
underserved by the RNC the Republicans
didn't seem to have enough lawyers Andor
observers for the election and uh car
Lake was sounding the alarm that they
were being a little underserved by the
Republican party and guess what
uh they just they just appointed uh
harit Dylan to be the the lead in the
Arizona uh program there to make sure
that the elections are fair now um if
you don't know the name haret
Dylan um I think you can watch in the
comments people will tell you oh my God
that's
perfect so could you tell could you tell
the people who don't know who she is in
the comments you would all agree right
so we we've been watching her for a long
time at X and we've watched what she's
done on behalf of the Republican party
she ran to be the head of the RNC
right so she was you know she was
sufficiently appreciated for everything
she's done and her capabilities that she
was one of the Front Runners to be the
head of the Republican National
Committee uh but to see a Powerhouse
like her moving into
Arizona um that changes
that changes the the look of it this is
not
trivial that this means that the
cheaters if there are any hypothetically
in Arizona are really really in in at
risk of going to jail because now you've
got the right brains and the right eyes
and the right number of the legs and
bodies I think soon that uh Arizona is
going to be carefully watched so this is
going to get really really interesting
uh I believe harit lost her husband um
this year and so you know I wish her the
best because that wasn't that long ago
and it's long enough that I think it
makes sense for her to you know get
involved and get her mind on something
else but uh we wish her the
best
um here's another one you should have
just asked me the Gateway pundits
reporting that o'keef media
uh they did a hidden camera deal and
they found out that the Mexican Army is
assisting the illegal migrants getting
across the border
huh let's see um was there anybody who
didn't think that the military of Mexico
is working with the
cartels is there anybody who didn't know
that I'm not sure I I mean I'm I think
it's a it's a great service from o'keef
media grp OMG I think it's a great
service that they can get that on on
video so now they have you know
apparently I haven't seen it but
apparently there's evidence that it's
pretty obvious some members of the
military some members are are helping
people get across which seems to me more
compatible with the cartel because we
hear that the cartel controls the border
and I can't imagine the military would
be doing things on the border unless the
cartel was aware of it and was okay with
it
so this is a case of it's nice to have
confirmation but I think we all knew
that I think we all
knew well has anything happened since I
started the show between Israel and Iran
did anything happened as Israel attacked
Iran in the last 60
minutes all right so if they
haven't um at least in a major way uh
here's my take on that so you know
Israel has to respond to Iran because
Iran sent the 200 missiles and uh tried
to take out some Israeli military stuff
mostly some airports and stuff and uh
although there wasn't that much uh
damage and destruction from the missiles
uh Israel does have to
respond now here's
my suspicions
guesses slash speculation
because I don't have any secret
knowledge right so I'm not operating
from any inside knowledge but the longer
the longer Israel takes to do whatever
it is that's going to be the response
the bigger it's going to
be now I can't say that's 100%
predictive but it seems to me that if
they just wanted to say hey you slap me
I'm going to slap you back they would
already know where they're going to
attack they would have already done it
because the immediacy of the response is
part of the response right responding
next year isn't going to feel like you
responded to anything it's just going to
feel like you did something so the
longer they
wait the less effective the response is
and they would know that you know
because it's not tied to the original um
offense but the only reason you would
wait is if it takes a while to put
together something
bigger now what would be bigger I don't
know but I'll tell you what I wouldn't
rule
out a decapitation
strike I wouldn't rule out that Israel
will just take out the leadership and
just walk away just walk away and say
now we're
even because here's the thing the
leadership of Iran funded Hamas Hamas
went into Israel and just slaughtered
people they have a right to kill the
leader leadership they have absolutely a
right to kill the leadership now of
course Hamas and a lot of Palestinians
would say that they have a right to kill
Israel's leadership for you know XYZ and
I'm not I won't argue that point
everybody thinks they want to they have
a right to kill the leader of whoever's
on the other
team but I've never seen as much
rational I've never seen as much
evidence that taking out the leadership
makes sense as it does right now
because now we've seen that Trump took
out Solomon Soloman and although they
may have tried to kill them in return
they
didn't and we've seen that uh Israel
took out um the heads of Hezbollah
twice got away with it so far you know
that they're going to get rid of the
head of Famas one way or another no
matter how long it takes so they're
certainly in a mode of thinking that
taking out leadership
works and that taking out leadership
will not have a giant
reverberation later now Iran would be a
whole different level but the thing is
that there there's one thing that I feel
very confident
about there's no
American or really anybody who wants a
war with
Iran I'm also confident that there's no
citizen of Iran and probably nobody in
the government who wants a war war with
Israel and a war with the United States
so I think that we're in this weird
situation where all the countries
involved are really really really don't
want a war like seriously seriously
don't want a war like have never not
wanted to war more than they don't want
this
war you know what that
means you got a free pass to take out
their
leaders if the citizens of Iran were
screaming for War I wouldn't take count
the leader because then they just get
another leader who's another badass and
he's got he's got a mandate from the
public but I'm not even so sure that
the that the uh Iranian public would
rise up you know typically if your
country gets attacked you're going to
say ah I don't like my leaders but today
I do I don't know it it could be that
the especially the young people in Iran
are saying you know I wouldn't have done
it that way I hate that my country got
attacked you know civilians got killed
too it's a tragedy but on the other hand
on the other hand might make something
better in the long run
so um I'm not going to predict that
Israel will take out the leadership
because I'm not sure they have a clean
shot they
might but I think it's at least 50%
likely I'm going to go
50% uh the other 50% would just be
they're just negotiating what they
attack and there's some conversation and
some people want to attack the nuclear
assets and some don't and so it could be
that but I've just got a feeling that
the longer they wait it's because it's
something bigger and it could be just
bigger in terms of the impact it has not
bigger in terms of the explod
ability anyway we'll see what happens
there so we wish the best to the
residents of North Carolina and all the
affected places in Florida today hope
all of you find a way to get out um we
just we may have I'm not sure but one of
the uh locals members uh got flooded and
one of the other locals members who's in
a part of Florida that did not get
flooded has already
offered to uh you know make some room so
if you have the ability to help somebody
out and Florida please do that um I
received my California voting ballot
yesterday in the mail so I'm ready to
vote and I would like to make the
following
suggestion that
um help me with the timing um I want to
vote uh on live
stream but so I want to vote on live
stream so that you can vote at the same
time so so I'd like the people watching
to literally get out their ballots and
then I will fill out mine you know it's
different than yours different state but
we'll just fill them out at the same
time and just mail them at the same time
I would love if all these many right
leing podcasters that I mentioned
earlier would do it at the same
time so wouldn't you love that all of
your favorite podcasters went live at
the same time and every one of them was
filling out a
ballot while you fill down your ballot
you do it at the same time
and we make it
special you know we make it something
everybody's in on now I don't know if
that would make you know a greater
number of people vote maybe but I think
making a
social could be a real smart play voting
by its nature is an individual act and
not everybody is motivated by their in
individual need to vote but people are
very motivated by any social situation
we're just wired that way so if you made
voting from an individual act to a
social act even if the social part is
everybody's online doing it at the same
time I feel like that would increase
your number of
votes maybe not a lot maybe
1% but we're in a 1%
race so I want to pick a
day and I'm trying to figure out the
best day would the best day be exactly
two weeks before before the election cuz
you you want to make sure that the the
post office delivers right one week
feels like it's
dicey I mean it would be legal you could
vote one week before but you know if
there's a hurricane or something the
mail the mail is late so how about two
weeks before election day so that would
be a Tuesday I don't know what date it
was but I'm just going to float that
idea for a day I want I want to see if
there's any interest so if any other
podcast asers have an interest um just
just drop a post on a um tag me on it so
I know you're interested and so the the
target date unless I get talked down a
bit the target date would be two weeks
before election day it' be a Tuesday and
we'll just all go live at the same time
and let's pick a time let's say let's
say 900 p.m uh eastern time so you can
get to 6 pm on the west coast and we'll
just
sit down we'll fill out our ballots and
we'll drop them in the mail so that's my
plan all right so uh locals I'm going to
stay with you the rest of you I'll see
you tomorrow thanks for joining and uh
going to locals privately if you're on
xor rumble or YouTube I will see you
tomorrow thanks for
joining
