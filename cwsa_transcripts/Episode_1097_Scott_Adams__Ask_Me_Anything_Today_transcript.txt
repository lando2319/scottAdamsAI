[Music]
hey everybody
come on in here it's time for coffee
with scott adams
the best part of the day i know it is
for me
and watch how some of that good feeling
transfers on to you that's how it works
so i'm in a good mood
you're in a little bit better mood and
today
we're going to do an experiment yeah
something exciting
normally i'm very prepared when i get on
these periscopes i've looked at the news
i've checked my twitter
today i just woke up so the question is
can i do this periscope with no
preparation whatsoever
well we'll find out and i'm going to be
taking questions
as part of my strategy for being
unprepared
does it really matter today nope there's
no news today
if you check the news which i did
briefly
you will notice there's not really any
news it's just made up stuff about
somebody may have said something done
something
somebody feels bad about something
somebody's personality is bad they're
worried about
somebody might do something their
character is bad somebody's loyalty
nothing there's no news but first
the simultaneous hip and all you need is
a gupper mug or glass tanker chelsea
sign a canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous up and it
is sure
good
ah how did i predict
kamala i'm going to take that question
first even though you are not a guest
yet
if anybody wants to ask a question on
here you can see guest mode has appeared
at the bottom of your screen if you have
a mobile device
it doesn't work on a laptop and you can
press that and put you in a waiting list
for me to
accept you as a guest so the question
was how did i predict
kamala harris and i almost hate to tell
you
a lot of it had to do with her look
because we're a very visual species
and the way people look makes a
difference if you were
you know short and bold could you be
president of the united states
talking about myself now um
not too easily not too easily if jeff
bezos
ran for president could he become
president
well he has every skill in the world
right so you'd think well
if jeff bezos can't run for president
who can
and the answer is uh it might
it might make a difference
it might make a difference uh how you
look
kamala harris has the look and the look
is not
before you say oh it's because she's
female or attractive or something like
that
no it's not that at all now she has both
of those things
she's female and attractive for age you
know everything has to be
highlighted or everything has to be
normalized for age
but that's not it the part that
uh set set her apart is that she has a
predator
look about her now she can obviously
she can be giggly and happy and smiley
she can be a
prosecutor the senator or an attorney
general so she's got a good
talent stack but she has a predator
look she is ambitious which
weirdly people are trying to make sound
like a negative
talk about your sexism a do they ever
say that about men
has anybody ever said we don't want that
man to be a vice president because that
man is too
ambitious nope
i've never heard that you know maybe
somebody's said it once but i've never
heard it
um but they said that about kamal harris
as if that's a negative that she's
ambitious so if you put
predator and ambitious and has the right
look but it's also
the right demographic i thought she
would be a strong match
up for trump what i didn't see coming in
the primaries
i didn't see this at all complete blind
spot
and say she was terrible at campaigning
just terrible
and that was reflected in the results
she was one of the first to drop out
but um the thing that i could tell about
her which is obvious is that she's smart
and remember the ambitious part if you
are smart and
ambitious you are also
coachable coachable
meaning that if she really really wanted
something she would go find somebody who
could teach her how to get it
in fact you know she's had mentors all
her life
right you know that that's part of the
good and the bad part of her story is
that she's had
the advantage of mentors willie brown in
particular
so if somebody can learn then
if you were selected to be in on the
ticket
you would be coached by the top coaches
in the world
whoever is coaching uh kamala harris
right now
let me tell you something with complete
certainty it's not her sister
because her sister was the campaign
manager i guess when she was
in the primaries and everything that
caballeros did seem wrong
something that a professional would have
said how about less of that
and maybe more of something else and
that never happened in the primaries but
as soon as she became
she sort of disappeared for a while and
then she started talking again
and there were some things that she
fixed which i had predicted
because that's the obvious way this
would go is that she would get better
help
and she would get better at doing public
stuff
and she stopped being jumpy if you used
to watch her shoulders would go up when
she talked
and it would make her look less
confident she'd be like well i don't
know why we're not doing something about
this
and why don't we do this and that
largely stopped
now think about that that was a lifelong
habit
that just sort of stopped somebody's
coaching her
and she's practicing right if you can
find somebody who's a learner
keep them and i'll tell you an anecdote
about that
in a minute um so she was
she had the right look she had the right
demographic person of color
woman she was a senator um
and she could be coached up to a higher
level and then when biden became the
likely candidate for the top spot it was
sort of obvious at that point
now let me offer this challenge to you
i think it was i might have been i don't
know if i was the first
or near the first to say that biden
had a mental disability meaning that
there was something happening with age
can anybody confirm that because i'm not
going to make the claim
but i don't remember anybody in public
here we're just talking about
public people i don't remember anybody
in public
who was as early as i was because it was
a long time ago when i said uh
are you listening to him it's not all
there now it's a little more obvious
everybody can see it
but i think i might have been among the
first so if you take the fact that he
can't make it all the way
but he's likely the nominee add to the
fact
that she would be the perfect solution
to that
and they had some personal connection
there and that apparently kamala harris
was a favorite of
some of the old school you know the
hillary clinton people were her
some of her staff in the primaries
so it all just kind of made sense that
she would be the puppet of the puppet
or she would be the double puppet play
so there you go you want another real
answer it's none of those
i'll tell you the real reason that i
predicted it
and it's none of the things i just said
they're all true
and i did go through that thinking
process do you want to know the real
reason
i could just see it the real reason i is
i could just see it
i could see it like it was the hand in
front of my face
now probably that feeling that i could
see it
which was identical to the feeling i had
when trump was running
it wasn't that i was predicting it
exactly
i just saw it i could just see it just
like i was looking at it
like it was right in front of me now
probably that's just
imagination fueled by the fact that the
requirements for that to happen were in
place and my brain wasn't quite
processing it logically
but it it presented that little movie
for me
because they had done the work it just
hadn't explained it yet
so the explaining it is what i did to
you so there is a
there's a logic and a structure to it
but the real reason
i just saw it just saw it like it was
right in front of me
now you all watched or some of you tried
to watch the democratic convention
i tried to watch a little bit of it but
it was just painful and
useless and didn't have any point uh aoc
is the big story today
because she uh she said she endorsed
joe she endorsed bernie sanders
in her one minute speech um not endorsed
she said she
[Music]
what's the other word doesn't matter
anyway apparently that was just a
procedural thing
because she sort of had to say that but
that she does endorse
biden but it certainly looked a little
suspicious
gotta admit she was not
legally legibly speaking i don't know
what you're talking about
yeah uh so you know i've warned some of
you before i'll probably start
blocking for this in the future so i
want to warn you
so there's somebody in the comments
who's making a
a kabbalah harris kneepads joke
and the knee pads joke they're funny
the first few times you hear them you're
like oh i get it it's because of this
and that
well actually it was never funny funny
but at least i you could understand why
somebody would say it the first time
if you're still making that same joke
about willy brown and kamala harris it's
time to let it go
it's just not funny it's not it's not
even a little bit funny
it's not clever it's not insightful it's
just bad form
so eventually i'll probably start
blocking people for
making that comment because i just i
sort of just don't want it in my
universe it's not that i'm offended per
se
i don't get offended on behalf of other
people it's just so boring
just really find something else to say
oh nominated was the word thank you so
aoc used the word
nominated not endorsed
all right so let me take a question
or more
we got lots of people who want to ask
questions let's see if we can get
somebody who's really
lively i think flip
all right somebody named flip is going
to be interesting
can you hear me flip hey do you have a
question for me flip
i do uh so james altucher friend of
yours
uh wrote a really interesting article
about the death of new york
and how unlike the financial crisis or
september 11th
now we have bandwidth so there's no
reason for the offices to fill back up
or people come back
so i'd just be interested to see who
your perspective on the future of cities
in america specifically new york but
generally just cities
yeah you know let me give you some
context
a long time ago when the radio was huge
and television did not exist the
television was invented
and it obviously was catching on quickly
and then quickly then soon there was a
color tv and everybody said hey
i guess radio is going to go away
because why would you have this radio in
your living room that you all gather
around to listen to the radio shows when
you have a television
makes perfect sense right like radio
obviously
will be extinct but instead radio got
bigger
it just moved it moved to the automobile
it wasn't obvious that that was going to
happen and then radio
became you know the rush limbaugh's and
the howard stearns it became huge
and i say that only because we are
really bad at predicting
we meaning all people so if you look at
new york city and you take the most
obvious prediction the most obvious
prediction would be
why do we need retail stores at all we
have amazon
why would anybody go back to a place
that's crowded and congested
it's hard to do anything it's expensive
and now
law enforcement has gone away or it's
not enough to protect your store
so the the straightforward walk right
down the highway that has no nobody
blocking you
is new york's going to have a lot of
trouble
at least with the business part of it
but going back to my radio versus
television analogy
the other possibility is that new york
will find a way to be a different new
york
so for example all that retail space
could get picked up by
tech companies i don't just just one
example
and then suddenly it's not so much
retail stores but you got your googles
and your amazons maybe
that sort of thing so it's completely
unpredictable
more unpredictable than anything what i
think is the least
likely outcome is it will go back to the
way it was
i think it'll have to go back to
something different um
but personally i don't know why anybody
would live in new york city at this
point
and i think that the cities are might be
they might be coming to a close faster
than they would have
i think you're going to find that
building homes that people can afford at
very low incomes
in places where there were no cities and
no towns before
should be the future and that would
leave some big questions about what do
you do with the stuff that's already
been built
that nobody can afford to live in and at
that point
supply and demand should even things out
and then it will be cheap to live in new
york
and people will live there because it's
cheap
that might be that might be what happens
to it oddly enough so that's just one
possibility
so i don't know if that came anywhere
near uh answering it but i think in the
future
cities will move to small structures
maybe even
single story things that people could
build themselves
but are really good to live in and have
schools and everything else you need
all right that was my answer uh thanks
for the question flip
thanks scott all right let's see what
else we got here
how about
jill see if we can get jill to connect
jill can you hear me oh
kamala harris pick was brilliant when
you said it because i know she just
lost and he made the prediction anyway
and i said you know
scott sees there's free money and he's
picking it up because it's like what do
you have to lose if kamala harris
doesn't get anywhere
further you lose nothing and if kamala
hales
harris does win big in this which he has
then you you you look like a god right
no i i i would uh i would say that that
would have been true
with my trump prediction in 2016
because at the time nobody thought of me
as a political
um pundit and nobody thought of me as
someone who could predict anything
but when i got the trump prediction
right
you know that wasn't as special because
lots of you got that right as well
i think what was different is i said it
in public which maybe
stand out a little bit uh but
with the kabbalah harris one once i had
been established as somebody who talked
about politics
if i had been wrong on this one i would
have been mocked forever i would never
have been able to turn on my periscope
without a troll coming in and say why
should we listen to anything you said
you picked kabul harris to be the
nominee and that's the dumbest thing
that ever happened
you know i never i would never hear the
end of it i love predictions that are
out on the edge because they
they stand the greatest reward and that
certainly did
right there and i loved it and as for
the cities
going away i think the original reason
cities
became in existence in the first place
in civilization was for protection
against
marauding um wild people that were on
the outskirts of the cities and i'm not
sure that would
not go away in the new future
with um antifa and antifa like groups
and marauding
people who are that's stuff that
i i love that point because yeah the
earliest cities had walls around them
and they were fortified for defense as
you just said
but today we might still want to put the
wall around new york
and seattle but for a different reason
to try to keep all the marauding people
on the inside
don't let them get into the countryside
i live here in seattle
and it's not so bad just the north end
of seattle
you know we have some protesters on the
corners and that was
great you could go down there and talk
to them and
there's nothing really in the um in the
in the
areas that aren't right in the middle of
the city so right in the middle of the
city is where all the protests have
always concentrated so it's not so bad
as you might think
what about these the retail stores once
you get out from the
the epicenter of it are the retail
stores open and functioning
the retail stores are open and
functioning a lot of them are low in
stock because
they were raided by some organized
criminal
activity that went through and just
looted them all at once to
just just dilute the
police presence they got a bunch of
their windows busted in
and we're ripped off majorly like best
pie for example was practically cleaned
out i went down there to shop the other
day and there
weren't any products on the shelf that i
wanted so i had to order them off amazon
so so those retail stores are good
except for the fact that they don't have
any products to sell
that's it yeah all right that could be
better all right thanks for the question
thank you sir all right all right let's
take another one
that doesn't sound like an ideal
situation they've only been robbed once
and have no product to sell but
otherwise
they're terrific let's see
if i can get this to work
okay that one didn't work that was for
you just oh but you went away
how about will i think will
might be here will you have a question
for me
good good thanks good um
i was kind of writing it down and didn't
get finished with it but um we've seen
the far
left causing mayhem uh it's it's gone
on across the entire globe from europe
uh to to here we see antifa
um really causing a lot of trouble in
the cities
and um it just it seems like we may be
headed to
a place where the normal people get fed
up with this
and take up arms against the far left
and i'm afraid this could be a worldwide
little pockets of civil war um do you
think that there's any possibility of
this
um you know i'm i'm hesitant to predict
because
it yeah you could get canceled pretty
easily for
for making it sound like you're
promoting violence
right so let me let me be as careful as
i can by starting out
saying i don't promote any violence
and i don't hope that any of this
happens but if you were just going to
connect the dots
and say what is the most likely outcome
of what you're watching
it does end with some firearms
that would be the most likely outcome
because it doesn't look like the
protesters are going to just burn
themselves out
by making their point and moving on
because the ones who just wanted to make
a point about systemic racism
i feel like they made their point
there's no more point that needs to be
made
the the ones who just want to destroy
everything and tear down
they don't have an end date because
there's no reason for them to stop
they're having fun it seems like it's a
social event
gives them meaning so what would stop
the worst of them the ones who were
there for
uh anarchy not the ones who were there
for social justice
what would stop the anarchists from just
going until everything's gone
nothing except force and it does seem
that the
uh the citizens don't seem to want to
put up any force
in in the cities where it's happening
and probably because it's not that close
to their personal homes
uh as soon as this moves close to homes
that's when you see like the the couple
who brought out the firearms
that'll happen everywhere so as soon as
the protesters leave the zone
where it's just a business where there
might be some business insurance
people have a different investment you
know emotionally a different investment
in their their work than they do in
their family but boy you get
you've seen a few anecdotes of you know
the few times that
antifa has gone into a little bit more
rural or suburban area
the mccloskeys he had the couple that
brought out their guns
in rural areas you know my neighborhood
there are a lot of guns around here i
mean people don't bring them out but i
can tell you for sure
this this neighborhood's pretty strapped
and
people would take out take out their
self-defense
at the moment the antifa showed up so
but that alone isn't going to stop
anything because it will just go where
it's a softer target right
if if they get resistance they'll just
go somewhere else because
they don't have a reason to quit but
what would give them a reason to quit
is if something bad happens and again
i'm not promoting it
so don't cancel me i'm not saying you
should do this
but the odds of one
let me tell you what it would probably
look like
one military veteran who has some skills
and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say more
than that right just one military
veteran
who just says you know this is going
beyond protest
this isn't the first amendment i would
die for the first amendment
if it's just freedom of speech i'll die
for you
that's you know a military person might
say such a thing
but if you're destroying my country
i have a vow to protect it and i don't
see anybody else doing it so the odds of
somebody with a military background
getting
almost activated if i could say that
because remember
if you're in the military you're
programmed you know you're actually
wired differently than anybody else for
good or bad you are
wired to be a different creature and i
think some of that lasts
i would assume i mean if ptsd can last
i would expect that also that you know
the the rest of the training or
experience
would have some lasting benefits and it
would only take
one event again i'm going to speak
generically just one event
that would make it a really bad idea to
go out in the street and be identified
as antifa
because they would think it would happen
again now it might happen to have to
happen more than once
before people say oh it's a trend it
happened twice
but i see that as the likely outcome
that there'll be somebody with a
military background
who will say not my country
i'm looking around not my country the
media would
would paint that person as far right and
they would become a villain in in the uh
you know the entire
news media is run by leptus pretty much
other than fox yeah yeah it would become
a story about the
crazy republicans yeah you're right it
would become one of those stories
it doesn't necessarily have to be a
republican or even a conservative
who might just have enough it could be
just somebody who lost their store
you know it could be somebody who was a
victim of it somebody who
you know a friend got beaten up by
antifa it could be just somebody who's
had enough
uh but in all likelihood if there's
let me just say this these things don't
stop without force
unless the group that's doing the bad
stuff has a reason to stop on their own
and they very much don't the the the
ones who want anarchy
only want to stop when everything's
broken so
only force will stop them and the
government has
indicated that it doesn't want to use it
at least the local government
and because we don't have a dictator it
turns out we don't have a dictator
surprise trump's not a dictator
the federal government won't move in and
we'll let the local
people just destroy their own city if
they want to
so the only way anything stops is with
force
if it's not going to come from the
government and be sanctioned and the
the appropriate kind it will happen
it will just come from another source
and then that's when the bad stuff
happens
so uh that answer your question
it does great thanks a lot thank you
all right let's take another if that
don't get me canceled
what will
all right cryptic are you there
hello can you hear me cryptic
do you have a question you have a
question for me scott how do we save
music how do we save music and art
so what what's to say if it looks pretty
good to me
let me elaborate um so if well actually
have you developed that
uh that thing where when you look at an
artist's profile and you kind of
you kind of say oh i can i could tell
that they're an artist and
and that um is there anything that
you're kind of developing with that like
a theory with why that's so because
i'm actually a rapper in austin texas
and i feel like
with my background in uh business degree
economics
and all that i feel like i'm really
singled out and i'm just like
looking at everyone around me and it's
it's
insane it's like the way everybody is
like
in the music business like you know
super like black lives matter
like supportive and stuff but do you do
you know why that is
yes i do uh in fact my book loser think
is
on that exact question it has to do with
your
has to do with your talent stack so as
you said if you have exposure to
decision-making
fields business economics you know law
medicine to some extent you know the
engineering any of the fields that teach
you how to think
you're probably going to do better in
understanding your world and dealing
with it
the people who become artists have two
problems
one is there's a self-selection thing so
the people who decide hey i think i'll
be an artist
it might be because they're good at lots
of things that they chose that but it's
also
a lot of people say i just don't like
math
math isn't going to be my thing i don't
want to sit in an office
so there's a self-selection thing and
then there's
a non-exposure because they're not doing
the things that would teach them how to
make decisions
and then there's the associating with
other artists which is
likely if you're in that world so they
have three things working against them
self-selection
who they hang out with and then lack of
exposure to decision making so it's
pretty straightforward
these are people who are either unable
or untrained
to look at things rationally and i feel
sorry for you if you're in that world
and you have to deal with them because
have you have you tried to have any kind
of a rational discussion
with your peers that you're talking
about and
and is it just head shaking that's not
just a different
it's not just a difference of opinion is
it there's something else going on right
there right it's it's literally like i'm
watching two
like two movies on one screen like say
like my own movie and then i'm watching
them have discussions that
like i just want to jump in there and
just you know
just say what why are you why do you
guys think this way but
i like i just have to like bite down and
just kind of
accept it sometimes because i feel like
it's just
it's just so overwhelming the difference
in opinions
it's wild so so uh just for fun
try this the next time these topics come
up with your friends
if you don't want to out yourself as the
one who disagrees
just try to give some clarification and
say you know suppose
suppose the protesters got everything
they wanted you know
in social justice etc who how would it
be paid for
and if they say well we'll get the top
top .01
to pay for it right then you say why
would they stay around
like what what would what would it why
would they stay in this country
if if they're being pickpocketed anyway
see see how that goes
back to me oh yeah move to austin i'll
see you here whenever you
eventually move over here well it's not
impossible
thanks thanks thanks for the question
take care for sure take care
all right how did i get so many
listeners for taking
questions i'm surprised all right let's
see if uh
daniel has a question
daniel hey daniel you have a question
for me
uh the last question in a way um i
wanted to ask you about education
um a lot of us don't really like the
idea of college these days
uh i've been i really didn't like
learning that
everything had to be understood through
the lens of race class and gender
so um so
i kind wanted to ask you as far as like
a liberal arts education or learning how
to think
um what would you recommend as a
starting place for like a personal
system for that
well for learning how to think um if you
want to understand the people who don't
think
well and i think that's a good start
google
persuasion reading list so you'll find
my list of books they're in the
persuasion and influence
realm so i'd say that's a
that's a good start because it tells you
what is irrational and why people are
like that
then uh the the fields that get you to
think better
are economics law engineering
you know science anything that has any
kind of a structured
process for figuring out what's true and
what's not is going to get you there
in economics you spend a lot of time
figuring out which variables
matter and comparing two things to other
things so you end up just
automatically building a brain that does
that reflexively
so anybody from i use this example all
the time
if you if i talk to somebody who's not
experienced with economics had no
influence and i say
is this president whatever president
doesn't matter which one
doing a good job or a bad one they'll
say oh yeah good job
or they'll say oh terrible job he's
botched everything
but if you ask an economist hey
economist
is this president doing a good job or a
bad job the economist will say
compared to who right because that's the
starting point
compared to what there was no other
president doing the same job at the same
time under the same circumstances
so that you could see how they acted
compared to this one
sure everyone makes mistakes but on that
is one of them going to be better than
the other you don't really know
it's unknowable so the economist is just
completely on a different page
with the person who hasn't studied any
of that
so i in terms of college
i would say that the softer the skill
the less useful it is
okay the the uh english literature
you know russian studies of literature i
suppose
uh you can tell just just go for the
ones that have some decision making
elements to them and you'll you'll do
better but do do take some kind of a
writing and speaking course
those are good for everybody all right
thanks scott appreciate it all right
take care
yeah college is gonna be really
different in a few years
i'm glad finally all right
let's see if michael's sweet has
something to say
michael do you have a question for me
that is uh anticipated in the chaos yes
go ahead if there is uh no result
from the election by the time uh
inauguration
comes down i think it would go
to the house of representatives do you
think that's so or
and how do you think that would play out
well i'm no constitutional scholar
but i would think that if we don't have
a result by
not by inauguration day that our options
would be
to either postpone the election or to
have it again
or postpone the result and the
inauguration
or to to redo it and i don't know the
legality of any of that
but i imagine we could make it past we
could make it past
legal muster because i think the supreme
court is going to say no
the constitution says these are your
deadlines
but the supreme court is humans not a
machine
so if you say to the humans on the
supreme court but you know
this year we just couldn't do it it
wasn't an option
i think at that point people just get
flexible and they say well
you know okay we're we're originalists
and
we don't like to deviate from the the
constitution
but the intent of the constitution was
to get a good result that people believe
that would be easy nobody would argue
with the fact that the intention
is to get a credible result and that and
the republic
requires that it's not optional
it's not optional that people believe it
was a real election
not in our system that's not optional so
you're going to do whatever you can to
make that problem go away
and i think that's going to be either
delay or just redo it
just wait uh so you might get a few
extra months of
a trump administration that the other
side didn't want
uh if he lost which i don't think is
going to happen so that that's where i
think it will go
i think people will just get real
flexible but i also
think that there's really no chance of
having a credible outcome
in the first pass it just doesn't seem
possible
it doesn't matter who wins just doesn't
seem possible
so the one and only outcome i could see
that would be
credible enough to avoid election
related
mass unrest is if trump won
by a landslide or i suppose if
joe biden won by a landslide so if
either of them won by
such a margin that even whatever
whatever stuff happened with the mail
you could even say okay two or three
percent of that which would be a lot
right if you had two or three percent
fraud in the national election
that would be a lot of fraud but if one
of them wins by
10 percent you you can let it go
so anything short of a major landslide
which is not really common in our our
system
at least lately uh is going to be
trouble
and i think that means delay or redo so
that's my guess great thanks scott
thank you appreciate you always
appreciate your perceptions
thanks all right let's see who else is
here
how about sammy the dog
sammy who has a icon like a dog
are you there sammy sammy
may have been watching on
a device that doesn't work for this so
we're going to try
dd dd
whose name is two parts that are the
same
dd do you have a question for me
pleasure it has to do it has to do with
the word chaos
i recently uh observed
many democrats using that word joe biden
kamala harris bill clinton used it
michelle obama used the word
um this this chaos do you think it's a
an effective branding word
or do you think it's weak um well
you know i've been asking myself the
same thing because they they use it all
the time
i do think that uh people have a sense
that everything's
unbalanced and that things need to be
rebalanced so chaos definitely gets you
there it's like hey this president is
full of chaos
so i think they're using chaos like they
use dark
you can take anything he does and say
it's chaos how about the way he dealt
with the middle east well
it's just chaos so it's a word like
botched
where you accept it uncritically if
somebody says well
this manager is not managing as well as
this other manager
you might say to yourself well i have a
different opinion let's look at the
variables let's look at you know really
compare these but if somebody says that
that
one person creates chaos you feel like
you're done
right because you're never going to want
the chaos anything
it's it's just an automatic no chaos
thank you now
thanks for offering i don't need any
chaos so
dark chaos botched any of those words
that have in them a sense of
non-specific badness are very good
because they don't have enough
specific badness to work with so as long
as they can keep using these general
words about his personality his
credibility is
his chaos they don't have to explain
exactly what he did wrong
or what they would do better and that's
bad for them
you know if they have to explain the
details because the details don't work
in their favor uh the
what the democrats want first of all
they don't agree with each other
so if you're if you're a democrat and
you're trying to sell the national unity
hey everybody
vote for this one person it's better if
you don't get too specific
because if they do their own team will
leave
as soon as they say we're going to do
this or that people who are democrats
will say
wait a minute that's not what i signed
up for exactly i wanted something way
more left to that
so the democrats have to hide their
intention from their own side
as much as they have to make a case
against trump so that word works really
well
for that i would say now i've i've often
said that
trump has the reverse message
which is law and order now law order is
not
punchy like you know botched or chaos
or dark it's it's a little too boring
and ordinary
so if the tru if the president could
come up with a
a response word and he the best play for
the president would be to use the word
against them
because remember how fake news the
president took the gun out of their
hands and flipped it around
it's just like that if you look at the
rioting it's chaos
so you could certainly make the case
that the republicans are the anti-chaos
team and the democrats or the chaos team
i th
i'd be i'm kind of surprised he hasn't
done that yet because it's such an
obvious play
so maybe you'll see that all right
thanks for the question
you're welcome thank you bye
all right let's see what blues lover
has for us today blues lover can you
hear me do you have a question
for podcasts i am a former california
person moved to south carolina
and i'm also an enrolled member of the
choctaw nation
native americans and i feel
like i feel that native americans are
not being acknowledged in the current
climate with mention of the 1619
program and also
watching a young girl in georgetown
saying black people used to live here
encouraging white people to move out but
so did my people
[Laughter]
good so yeah my tribe is actually from
the southeast
uh complex of mississippi and alabama so
although i'm a conservative and
i'm really against identity politics
i want to know how native americans can
become part of the conversation of
lifting people up
or just our general acknowledgement of
our
of who we are in their education or
economics
well that's a good point uh it was only
a few years ago that i thought i was a
native american too i had the elizabeth
warren problem
my family we had all been raised to
believe that we had some
proportion of native american blood but
when i did a dna test
it turns out it's zero exactly zero and
i've heard a lot of people since then
say that they
they had a similar situation so i guess
it was trendy
to say that you were part native
american which is part of my answer
is part of my answer native americans
have always had
sort of uh a positive image in
the standard you know uh european
based person who came over to the united
so st would often say hey yeah we were
one of those too because it was so
positive you like to claim it as part of
part of your identity
so you have a little different situation
you don't have apples and oranges here
with the black community
but of course uh if you notice
last night um as each of the states had
got 30 seconds
to do their nomination of biden that
there were a number of native americans
who were selected to represent their
state
and i only watched it for a little bit
but i think i saw a three
out of maybe 10 and i thought wow that's
really very high recognition of the
you know the native american populations
in those states
and uh but you're right you're right
the the problem with the black lives
matter movement
is that if it works it's self-destroying
because if it works it would cause
extra attention to go to one part of the
public and the rest of the public would
say
wait a minute we weren't in favor of
extra attention so much we just wanted
equality
so you can imagine that anything can
overshoot the mark
so i think black lives matter will uh
destroy itself
because it has a message that has a
timer on it
right yeah if ever yeah the is sort of
you can see the the fuse is burning and
you're saying okay this isn't going to
last
much longer when the leaders of black
lives matter are saying
let's uh or even members are saying
let's kick these white people out of
their house and give it to black people
and stuff like that so it's sort of
self-destroying so let me say this
um is what you're looking for more
attention because you would want more
resources
to go in that direction or is it more
just a recognition that you're looking
for
i think a recognition but also perhaps
uh resources trump has been great for
the native americans he's signed
the murdered missing indigenous people
um
bill as well as allowed tribal lands for
us to
leave it to other people in the tribe
which previous presidents had
not signed obama so he's done a lot it
just doesn't get attention
so i as somebody who let me just say
for you and your audience when i hear
people say we're a nation of immigrants
it like kind of bothers me a little bit
and i don't
i don't like identity politics but i'd
like us to be
acknowledged at the table as just being
equal not being better than
or original or anything just
at the table but you know
uh to my to my other statement
do you find that there's much day-to-day
any kind of discrimination against
native americans
is that is that even part of your
experience
well i i have blonde hair part of the
colonization so there is um some
discrimination
for indians that don't maybe fit the
complete bill um by the way we don't go
by dna
uh we we do go by genealogy so you know
we have actually there's a card that
people get
if you're an enrolled member so um
so it's kind of interesting but i i
we i think we are being discriminated
against
with the 1619 project oh that's true
yes well in the sense that uh your
your uh your place in history is
minimized by that yeah you have a good
point
or being great yeah
yeah like like the beginning well yeah i
can see that
so um you have the disadvantage of
numbers right what percentage of the
united states is native american is it
two percent one percent i i i it's under
three
yeah it's under three yeah so having
numbers would help
everybody who's in that one or two
percent is
going to have trouble getting attention
in this world
uh so your point is well taken thanks
for the call
thank you all right
interesting all right let's see if we've
got
another caller here whose name i will
not try to pronounce
hello caller can you hear me hi how do
you pronounce your first name
okay ching do you have a question for me
yes uh so my question was about
building good habits like um
sometimes like i have bad habits like
uh i don't want to get out of bed
and like then i just make myself more
more miserable and i know that
every time i don't procrastinate i just
get up
and i do my meditation or do anything
i'll feel better but for whatever reason
sometimes i just keep slipping back into
those bad habits
now when you're in it and you let's say
you're laying in bed and you're saying i
should get up
but i'm just not is is that the
situation where you you know you should
and you're just not doing it
yeah i know i should and then i think
i just i start tormenting myself with
like
all these thoughts all right try this
so this is a tip from my book loserthink
and uh it has to do with how to how to
how to break couch lock because i have
this myself i'll be sitting on the couch
and i'll be perfectly happy
but i know i'm supposed to be doing
something else i just can't get myself
off the couch
i just my brain is having a conversation
with my body and saying
you know you should be doing something
else and my body is just like
nope gonna sit in the couch here is the
hypnotist
trick for breaking that you wiggle your
pinky
just wiggle your pinky because it's your
your brain won't have an objection to
that and neither will your body
so you just wiggle it and then you let
that wiggle the finger go to the rest of
your hand
and you just move your hand as soon as
you move your hand you'll be able to
move your arm
and you can stand up so in other words
you take agency over your body
because for momentarily it's as if your
body and your brain are
disconnected it's almost like they're
having a conversation with each other
hey get off the couch
not really so as soon as you take
control of the smallest part of your
body
just wiggle your pinky it uh it
reactivates your connection
and it tells your body who's in charge
and then your executive function can say
off the couch and now we're on to
something else that's the first thing
second thing is you should develop a
system a consistent
system of rewards for anything you want
to do more of
so if you want to exercise more make
sure that when you're done
immediately after you're done exercising
is always a reward
i like to have a you know nice smoothie
that is delicious
spend some time looking through my phone
and just have some down time and not
work
and to me that's like a delicious little
you know 35 minutes there
and so that reward just trains us like
dogs
to seek the reward even if we're not
consciously thinking it
so there's a book called uh habit
by charles duhigg d-u-h-i-g
might be two g's i forget um and he he
teaches you how to develop habits so i
would recommend the book habit
try the pinky trick and give yourself a
real
reward for whatever you want to do more
of and that will get you started
okay thank you scott you're welcome
and
that was a very functional question
because there probably a lot of you who
are saying you know
i'd like to hear the answer to that
question let's see if
taylor has a question taylor
come to me your technology has failed
taylor
we will go with amy
amy amy amy can you hear me
are you the amy who recently sent me
something in the mail
no i'm the amy who told you that uh
fitton was not a lawyer oh
yes that was quite a shock to me because
i just assumed he was i think it's
because
the the person who had his job before
that was a lawyer right
i don't know about that he's been doing
that a long time i just like the fact
that he's got pecs and buys
you know he's he's pretty uh
strapped with that yeah and you know you
well you're a little bit younger than i
am and so um but you know we're fighting
to keep our
young appearance and all that kind of
stuff particularly as a woman it's
really necessary as you
might not know or do so
anyway i do have i i've been
struggling with this sending kids back
to
indoctrination centers from people on
the right
and people on the left wanting to keep
the kids home which you would think that
they would want to keep their kids
indoctrinated
or in that so i've been struggling i
have a grandson
at home and he's going in person two
days a week
and i've got him home three days a week
which has been wonderful because
now i can see what he's not getting
and it's scary as all get out it really
is
yeah i don't think a lot of us i was
speaking for myself i don't think we
knew how bad it was
i i was opposed to public school because
i saw
um the destruction of just putting kids
in that
environment because kids are terrible to
eat to each other
and you're guaranteeing that you're
putting your kid into a bullying
a bullying situation unless they are the
bully
so there's no there's no good answer
there so it's a very cruel
world and i've i've spent a lot of time
trying to think
well would it be better to home school
because then you don't get the socialize
socializing unless you really work on
making sure it happens
i don't know on ballots i think public
school is bad for kids on balance
you know given that you could educate
them a different way well
my grandson is on the spectrum and
one of the things that is nice now is
that they aren't
demonized as they were like when we were
in school and we didn't really even know
what we were dealing with back then
in the late 60s and 70s and
so there is a lot of understanding but
then again
he's he's for the socialization
but as a literalist i'm afraid that he's
going to suck all this stuff and turn
into something that
really won't serve him best in the long
run so
yeah oh you know i think i think it's
going to go the other way
because uh you when you say on the
spectrum
are you saying on the spectrum like
he'll he'll be an engineer someday or
like he has more problems than that no
that's that's the goal because he
he truly is a math genius and he has
perfect pitch so he's a music genius as
well
right so i i wouldn't worry about him
i don't because here because here's the
thing he's he's wired
based on what you're saying he's wired
for rational thought
and if somebody tells him something that
he can't see and observe
i just don't know he's going to be
gullible so you
you may have raised somebody who is
unusually resistant
to the very thing you're worried about
well that's what the hope is
that's what the hope is because you know
dad has a degree as a master's in
computer science and we've got another
son with a phd in chemistry
and you know and and i have a stem
degree and my husband has a stem
degree so i mean they don't have a
chance they don't have a snowball's
chance in hell
of going to the left i hope
well we'll see that all right thanks for
the call
well thank you all right take care
[Music]
all right uh let's do one more
we'll take uh donna and then we'll rap
if donna's technology works donna are
you there
good morning what's your question free
i'm curious if you read the new york
times article or any of the other
responses to
the thousand page uh senate report
i i i glanced at it and
it looks like they're trying to make an
opposite claim of reality but saying you
know about trump's campaign ties to
russia et cetera et cetera
i'm having trouble making all of that
mesh with everything that you've been
talking about
um and you know i want to be able to
talk about it with people in a way that
makes sense so i'm curious if you read
it and if you have any comments on it
um i don't read the new york times
because i don't
because i don't trust it um as being a
credible news source anymore i hate to
say that i mean it's just the worst
thing in the world
and i don't say that as a partisan i i
say that
as objective fact the news just isn't
really giving us news anymore
so i i don't read it and if it's beyond
a paywall i'm not going to like pay to
read something i don't trust
so uh you're saying that they're making
the case
that uh the the trump had been the trump
campaign did have connections to russia
is that what you're saying what it said
was that
some people in trump's campaign talk to
some russians but that's true so
yes so the claim is that because there's
a lot of
information about people in trump's
campaign talking to russians
that that proves everything that they've
been talking about since the beginning
yeah well i i think you just have to
dismiss that as
uh the fake news doing what the fake
news does
you know the the most normal thing in
the world is for an incoming
administration to have
people that they know in the russia
sphere
keep in mind that russia's objective
is to make sure that whoever the
administration is or even if it's a
a maybe administration coming in that
they would give them as much contact as
they possibly could
because the more contact the better from
russia so remember you got russia
doing perfectly legal things which is
have a phone call have a meeting
talk to somebody create a channel
so it sort of would have to look like
this under
under every situation i believe it would
look like this it wouldn't matter what
the administration was
so the way i would answer it is you
realize that whoever is the next
administration after trump whether it's
you know this year or some other year
whoever is next is going to have a lot
of
initial contacts and past contacts
with russian russian folks
so you should first explain it away as
normal
and say it's going to be like that for
every administration regardless and
always has been
i'm sure there hasn't been a past
administration that didn't have some
serious contacts with lots of russians
they have an embassy
they have a reason to have contact we
have a reason to have contact with them
there's nothing unusual about it so
there's no story there is what i'd say
gotcha okay thank you scott i appreciate
it all right hope that helped
okay um i don't want to go any longer
but i was surprised that we got as many
people
here to watch this let me just wrap up
on the
um on the democratic convention last
night
it's obvious that this recorded speeches
and stuff
just doesn't have the same pizzazz as
anything live
but i thought they you know did a little
bit better job
last night i don't know who the
candidate is who's running because i
don't
you know it seems like he's a non-entity
except for his name
and uh everybody's just waiting for
the moment that joe biden has to talk to
somebody without
without looking at a teleprompter
everything else
kind of doesn't matter so we've got to
see that before we know anything
so bill clinton uh talked and got mixed
responses and even
even cnn one of their panelists was
making a big deal about
uh why isn't he cancelled already and
that that question just lingers so
um oh is tonight the nomination official
nomination tonight
all right well i don't know if that'll
be interesting either
and that is all i have for today and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
