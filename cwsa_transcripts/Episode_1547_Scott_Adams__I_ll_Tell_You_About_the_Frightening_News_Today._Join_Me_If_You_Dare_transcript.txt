good morning everybody
and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened in
the history of the universe
metaverse and every other verse
all of them best thing
and you
are smart enough and sexy enough to be
here at the right time yeah and some of
you are even prepared others still
working on it still working on it but if
you'd like to crank it up a notch and i
think you do
don't you yeah yeah why not
because as i learned in economics class
in college
my professor explained the most
important thing i've ever heard in my
life
it's about money and i'm going to give
you this important lesson which
in a way
summarizes four years of my college
education
it goes like this
when it comes to money
more is better
and when it comes to the simultaneous
sip more is better too
and all you need for more is a copper
mug or glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
no holes in the bottom no holes
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine heat of the day that the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it's gonna happen now watch what it does
to your antibodies watch this watch this
go
whoa
is it my imagination or am i regrowing
hair on the top of my head
i mean it feels like it the antibodies
are going nuts now
now here's a question for you
does my
repeated reference to the improvement in
your antibodies
actually cause anybody's antibodies to
improve
what do you think
i've taught you much about persuasion
and about the human body
speculate if you will
the fact that you come here and we have
some connection because you're here
do you think they're reminding you that
the simultaneous sip will improve your
antibodies
do you think it'll increase them
i think so
yeah
your mileage might vary but i think so
all right i just saw this uh post i
think this was on instagram but
originally on twitter somebody put it on
instagram
uh by neil brennan
this
i think this is
the this is the tweet that sums up
everything for the last six years
in one tweet are you ready remember it's
halloween
and he tweets
somewhere a white person is planning a
costume for tonight that's gonna eff up
their whole future
no he didn't use the whole word not f
but uh
yup
somewhere somewhere there's a there's a
white person putting on a costume it's
gonna ruin his whole life or her whole
life but i think it's probably a guy
if i might be sexist for a moment he's
probably a guy
doesn't have to be
or probably probably
uh
there's a story about uh alec baldwin
he's finally talking to the press and as
he was talking his
wife hilaria
tried to interject herself into it and
apparently uh it's reported that alec
baldwin snapped at his wife he snapped
at her
what was a word that they might have
used in the past for a story like this
snapped at her
something about what she did
caused a reaction in him
to make him
snap
there's another word for that isn't it
triggered
triggered yeah
don't they usually say triggered
i don't know why they didn't use it this
time
well my favorite story of the day and
it's hard to pick a favorite today
because the the news is all crazy stuff
but my favorite probably
is the lincoln project uh you know the
linking project to sort of the
the anti-republican
uh mostly they were anti-trump but
anti-republican it seems
and they're actually ex-republicans i
guess so that was their deal
and they uh
tried to influence the
virginia governor race by having five of
their members
dress up as white supremacists
now if you didn't know how white
supremacists dress
this is one of the things that the
lincoln project taught us
apparently to dress like a white
supremacist
you need a
shirt preferably white with a collar
and you need
khaki pants
long khaki pants
and maybe a baseball hat
you put that outfit on and you you know
you
accessorize with a tiki torch
and anybody's going to think you're a
white supremacist
anybody sees that they're going to say
well that's a white supremacist look
might as well be wearing the hood i mean
that's that's the whole uniform right
there
and so five of them pretended to be
actual white supremacists
and they posed in front of the
republican candidate's bus
to make it seem as if he was associated
with
uh the white supremacy
now
i i've seen this story for sort of a
couple days old or several days old the
story
and there was one small detail in the
story that i missed
and
what i understood about it was that
people were wondering whether these were
real white supremacists or perhaps you
know some kind of a political theater
and you know i looked quickly at the
picture and wasn't too interested and
i thought to myself yeah it looks like
some people pretending to be white
supremacist or maybe they are i don't
know but i didn't really look too
closely at the picture
did anybody look closely at the picture
there are only five of them
one of them is black
i'm not making this up
they sent a black guy
to pretend to be a white supremacist and
there were only five people
but they decided that uh diversity
in their project was perhaps more
important than
authenticity
and so they favored diversity over
authen authenticity and sent a black guy
which represented 20 of all the people
there and one was a woman
a white woman
um
and this is how well they did their
prank
now here's the funny part
you're probably thinking to yourself you
know if i were gonna design a prank
where i was trying to convince people
that these were white supremacists
i probably would discriminate against
the black candidate for that job
i don't know
i probably wouldn't discriminate because
that's just me i have a bad character
but
the people of the lincoln project have
shown us the way and showed us what good
character looks like and people who are
more woke i think
and so 20 of their white supremacists
were a black man
you have to admire their commitment to
diversity i think that's admirable
cnn has some fake news a surprise are
you surprised
are you surprised that cnn has some fake
news
well they do here's the the fake
headline trick where the headline
doesn't match the story
i think this is their favorite trick
because people don't read the story
is anybody guilty of reading the
headline and thinking
well i don't think i need to read the
story because the headline is the story
you know
if you read a headline that says
biden stubs his toe
do you need to read the rest of the
story
because if he'd hurt himself badly it
would say you know bite and hospitalized
but you read a headline biden stubs his
toe you think well i don't need the
detail
i don't need to know which toe it was or
how he did it he stubbed his toe
so cnn does this where they'll give you
the headline to make you think you know
the story
and this one was their headline was
quote a completely damning video of a
trump ally emerges
and showed uh undercover video of
conservative lawyer john eastman
and he was part of the
conversation about
you know not certifying the election and
seeing if pence would overturn it
and so i i decided to
play
the completely damning video
there wasn't anything even slightly
damning in it
it was like nothing damning at all it
was literally exactly what you already
knew
that he and other people thought yeah
wouldn't it be great if
pence could overturn this thing
it's all the stuff we do
there's literally nothing damning in it
that isn't just common knowledge already
so yes the completely damning video that
had no damning information yet here's
some more fake cnn news
where the headline doesn't match the
news it said that fox news is trying to
distance itself from tucker carlson
fox news is trying to distance itself
from tucker carlson and it's because
and you say to yourself whoa
you know the implication of this is whoa
even fox news management
has figured out what a monster
tucker carlson is so they're trying to
distance themselves
but then you listen to the story or you
read it
and is the story about
fox news
distancing itself
nope nope
it's not the story here's the story
that they characterized as fox news
distancing itself
apparently in an in exchange with a some
publicist or pr person associated with
fox news
the
that person the pr person said quote can
you please add so it's clear
that these new episodes talking about
the
new new series that tucker carlson is
having
and he said can you make it clear that
these episodes are on fox nation now
that's their app where you can see extra
opinion stuff
make it clear that it's on fox nation
the subscription-based streaming
platform that is behind a paywall
i don't see that noted anywhere in the
piece
tucker carlson originals which is what
this episode is is not for the channel
meaning not for the regular fox news
now
is that an example of fox news
distinct distancing itself from tucker
carlson
i don't see it
here's what i see
fox news is really good
as separating news from opinion
that's what just happened
fox news said make sure you know
that we separate the news from the
opinion now fox news channel
as opposed to fox nation the the app
that that they also are associated with
fox news channel also does a good job in
my opinion
of saying this program is news and this
is opinion
whereas cnn what's the what's the big
criticism you hear from me about cnn
that they don't do that
they their their news slash opinion
is sort of merged
you know all their news is opiniony
and i'm not saying that's good or bad
i'm just saying that's a different
business model whereas fox news likes to
let you know what's news and what's
opinion
and i think a pr person just emphasized
exactly what they want you to know
what is news and what's opinion if it's
on fox nation it's opinion
now is that distancing or is that
clarifying
to me it's just clarifying
it's clarifying a basic
corporate philosophy of separating their
news from their opinion
and but it's treated like cnn like it's
some kind of flaw
all right so i call that fake news
then uh new york times
had a little uh fake news themselves
so i was reading an article uh just i
think it was today
it said that the new york times said
that the fbi informants the idea that
there were fbi informants behind january
6 that it was actually organized as like
a false flag etc
has been debunked
has been repeatedly debunked
so that's what the new york times says
that the idea that the fbi was behind
the january 6 stuff has been repeatedly
debunked
and they they linked to two articles
one one was hyperlinked
repeatedly
and the other was separately
debunked
now if you're reading this do you say to
yourself oh
it looks like this is pretty well
debunked because it's been debunked
repeatedly
and debunked
now do you click on those links
how many people click on those two links
that say it's been repeatedly and here
you can see for yourself debunked and
see for yourself
well i click those links
to see if they've been repeatedly
debunked
here's what debunked means in the new
york times
way of thinking first of all it's a link
to their own reporting
okay
just note that it's their own reporting
it said that there is no evidence
of this claim in june so in early june
they said there's no evidence for this
claim
is that debunked
if a if a major news organization
says there's no evidence of a thing they
looked for no evidence of
we didn't find anything when we didn't
do our research
and when we didn't look for it there was
nothing there
and that's what they call the debunk
it's debunked because they didn't look
for it and didn't find it
now i i happen to think it didn't happen
right just to be clear
i want to be clear
i don't think the fbi organized
the the riots i'm i'm open to the
argument though
i'm open to the argument that there was
some involvement and
maybe in some way you could claim that
that happened i'm open to it i i just
same as the new york times i haven't
seen any argument
to debunk it or i'm sorry i haven't seen
any any evidence for it
now um i also haven't seen the special
because it hasn't run yet
so i think they're debunking something
they haven't seen
that has to be noted they've only seen
the trailer and i can't imagine the
trailer gives you the context you would
need
so
the fbi so so that was one link one link
was from june now isn't the entire um i
haven't seen the special of course
because it hasn't run but
back beyond this assumption
we can't know for sure but isn't the
assumption that we've learned something
since june
am i wrong about this give me a fact
check on this isn't the whole
uh tucker carlson
special based on what we've learned
since june
am i wrong
yeah i think i'm right
so when the new york times says it's
been repeatedly debunked and linked to
an article from june
when the entire point of it is we've
learned things recently
that's just fake news isn't it
how is that not fake news
i mean it looks like it's intended to be
misleading
it doesn't look like an accident does it
and then the other link i looked at was
from march
it was from march
do you think we've learned anything
about january 6
since march
and the new york times was trying to
sell these two links as clearly
debunking it and then the only debunk in
it was a link to snopes
basically saying it was unfounded
in march
so again
i actually my prediction would be that
no matter how much you look into it and
no matter what i hear on tucker
carlson's uh show that i haven't seen
yet because it hasn't aired
um i i don't think that that will
that the speculation that the fbi caused
it i don't think that that's going to
hold
but i could be wrong
does everybody hear this part
because if it turns out i'm wrong i want
you to remember the part where i said
you know i'm not i'm not positive about
it
but my best guess
if i had to put odds on it
eighty percent
i'd say i'm eighty percent confident you
won't find the fbi was behind it
but 20 is a pretty big pretty big number
and the 20 isn't based on anything
except just how i feel
experience i guess
all right
president biden met with uh turkey's
erdogan
and it made me wonder is there a story
that hasn't been told
correct me if i'm wrong go back into the
wayback machine reverse your
time
i take you back to a time
when a president named trump
was discussing pulling american troops
and of syria
and the big conversation was you fool
you fool you can't do that
because the kurds who have been our
allies will be slaughtered the moment we
leave
that really happened right i mean
the story happened
and then
time passes
what happened to the kurds
is there any update on the kurds
because i was kind of worried about that
weren't you
i mean that seemed like that seemed like
a pretty major deal
not just in terms of you know life and
death but in terms of strategic
i know branding for the united states
if we could if we could abandon that
ally we could abandon another and
apparently we did in afghanistan so i
think it's a big part of the story
did the kurds
have a bad ending
or did they just negotiate their way to
some kind of a
you know stable situation
does anybody know what happened
yeah were the kurds in the way
uh somebody's asking me if i'm biased
because i'm predicting that the fbi were
not involved
but i don't know what would be the bias
biased by what
i i'm
if if you're looking at just a
prediction that's just based on how i
feel and my
experience it's not really based on much
then i would say i don't know if it's
bias
or just we're all biased all the time so
maybe that's just built into it i think
bias is built into every prediction
isn't it
i don't think you can separate that
all right uh here's what i would like
all of you to do
i don't ask you for much do i
i mean i try to give you this
best quality entertainment that's ever
existed in the
history of civilization and before
uh and what do i ask in return
what do i ask in return
very little
very little but today i have an ask
and
i would like us all to join together in
what i consider a very important cause
which is a prank
to see how many people we can convince
that
president biden's real name
that his real legal name
is francis joseph biden
also known as
f joe biden
can we do that
can we start calling him francis joseph
biden
just sort of throwing in you know some
references
don't even don't even make a big deal
about it maybe just do a tweet in which
you refer to him that way
possibly when you're talking to your
friends you say
i don't know i'm not so sure francis
joseph biden is doing the job that we
elected him for
or you might say
oh i heard that
francis joseph biden was visiting the
pope
and don't make a big deal about it just
just throw it in as a reference
francis joseph biden
because if we can get this to work
then we can also tweet
f dot joe biden
and it looks like we're just talking
about his name so f joe biden president
which leads to a very important question
from twitter user willy nilly who asked
this insightful question
did people hate scott fitzgerald
i'm just going to let that um settle for
a little bit
did people hate scott fitzgerald
now that's only for you who are literary
in nature
and know that there's a famous author
named f scott fitzgerald
it's very funny if you knew that
all right
we have new video of biden molesting the
pope
and by molesting i mean
when joe biden grabs your hand for a
handshake
that uh that mofo doesn't let go
and it got a little too close
and you've got to watch the video
of joe biden not releasing the pope's
hand
getting way too close to his personal
space during a pandemic
and
and spitting a very long story onto his
face
and
yeah they they say that you can get uh
you can still carry a coven if you're
vaccinated
now i know the president probably gets
tested every every day and every time he
goes into a meeting with world leaders
but uh
there's a non-zero chance that fg
francis joseph biden
just gave the pope covent
which i don't wish on the pope at all
i don't wish on the pope at all
but uh here's another uh reference
you're gonna make a joke
that no more than 20 of you will get so
this is just for the 20 to get it
when i saw the photo of joe biden
together with the pope
i thought to myself huh
i'll bet both of them in the woods
anybody
anybody
that reference
i think both of them in the woods
anybody
okay
i guess that one was just for me
maybe it was just for me
but that if you knew what i was
referring to it's kind of funny it's
kind of funny
all right so uh there's a rupaur video
of their meeting by rupar i mean a uh
deviously edited video to make biden
look uh
more incapable than he actually is so
the video uh in the in the real thing
without the fake edit
uh biden is launching into a very long
story about satchel paige a black
baseball player who
i know broke some records
and
uh
the the rupaul part is they cut out the
part where uh biden explains what he's
talking about
and it looks like biden is
[Laughter]
it looks like
it looks like
[Laughter]
it looks like
it looks like biden thinks he's meeting
satchel paige
[Laughter]
satchel paige a
famous old baseball player who was black
and
the funniest part is i saw people in the
comments who are like you know wtf
what's going on here because they
actually thought
they thought it was within the realm of
possibility
that but
that biden had met the pope and confused
him with an american black baseball
player
and
[Laughter]
you have to ask yourself if there are
american citizens who who their their
first encounter with that was that it
was probably true
and that's the leader we that's the
leader we elected
oh
but my favorite part you have to see
this video it's funny all the way
through
but the funniest part to me
was
the funniest part to me
was that by
holding his hand and and holding him too
close he launches into this boring story
and then the i guess the translator
realized uh oh
you know this is more than how are you
doing so i'd better run in there and
translate so the translator runs in
there to translate his his way too long
boring story about satchel paige
you know winning i don't know doing a
shutout at age 45 or something like that
and as biden gets too
close to the end of the story
but he hasn't reached the punch line
the translator tells the pope you know
he's not done with the story but the
pope i think hoping that the story's
over
he does the universal uh
the universal body language that says
ahaha
that's a good story and we're done with
the story now he he does the
you know the fake laugh
but then he realizes that wasn't the
punchline
that there's more to come and i and i
could just imagine the pope like praying
to god in that moment
dear god
please make him let go of my hand and
end this story get his
coven spindle out of my face
dear god what have i done to you have i
sinned well i thought i'd been a good
catholic no help me help me help me now
that's what i thought the pope was
thinking
uh but maybe i'm wrong about that really
just speculation
um
what else is happening
uh
the other thing that's funny about that
story
is it was the kind of story that you you
really don't think there's much chance
it's going to translate too well
and but
biden was not was not disappointed all
right
um there is an interesting little uh
twitter
battle going on if you can call it that
between
uh anti-racist
what would you call him uh ibrahim candy
uh if if you like him you call him a a
warrior
on the side of anti-racism
and one of the most famous people
promoting
you know the the fight against
systemic racism
now if you don't like him you would say
he's a racist
so depending on whether you like him or
you don't like him he's either an
obviously a racist or he's an
anti-racist
so he's the greatest person or the worst
person depending on your point of view
and he had a little twitter exchange
with uh jack passovic
you all know jack from twitter
and uh
the issue was about uh
so ibrahim kennedy at first some
background i told you about this story
before but there's an update to it
so candy had tweeted that there were a
bunch of white people who were applying
to college and lying about their
ethnicity thinking it would give them an
advantage
and
the uh i guess 75
of the kids who claimed they were native
american got accepted to college
and
so and then he later deleted his own
tweet a lot of people including me said
well i think there's a obvious reason he
deleted the tweet because it proves
everything he said
is wrong
that systemic racism does exist but it's
against white people because white
people are trying to pretend to be
another ethnicity to get advantages
and so
the speculation is because we can't read
abraham kennedy's mind and i don't think
it would be fair to do that
but the speculation was the reason he uh
let's get rid of this red herring guy
again
goodbye
all right the speculation is that he
realized that his tweet
debunked his entire philosophy and
reason for being because it showed that
white people were pretending to be uh
people of color to get advantages
now when jack
uh posabic tweeted
you know something of that
nature um
jack used the phrase uh i i broke him or
i broke
i broke kenny
so that was jack's tweet and it was
referring to the you know
the exchange
and
um
i have to agree with jack except
if i did
if i did
apparently i'd be a racist
because what we learned from ibrahim
kennedy
is that
using the words that you broke him if
it's referring to a black man or woman
that you broke them
that is a reference to slavery
did you know that
did you know that you say when you say
you broke somebody
it's actually that historical uh
roots are in slavery and so really it's
a reference to breaking a slave
did you know that
no you didn't know that because it's not
 true
right
now it might be historically true that
the word was used in in slavery i don't
know
but words get used in lots of different
ways
when when people say they broke somebody
it is purely a twitter reference
it's a social media reference that's all
it is
and
what does it tell you when somebody
makes a point and then the response to
the point is to attack
the messenger
what does it mean when somebody ignores
the point
and attacks the messenger
in this case by calling jack a racist
for using the term broke
what's that mean
well it could mean that you're dealing
with a
vulnerable narcissist that would be one
possible explanation because vulnerable
narcissists use this technique
if you
counter their argument with anything
effective they will never argue their
argument they will go right at what's
wrong with you they attack the messenger
so i'm not saying that kendy is a
vulnerable narcissist i'm just saying
that's a behavior associated with with
people who have a personality disorder
so
whatever the whatever the issue is with
candy it matches the symptoms of a
personality disorder
as opposed to an argument
um
but then kennedy said that uh jack lied
about candy's tweet but he didn't really
detail what he lied about so i tweeted
to ask for a clarification
um and what kennedy said was
that
jack was basically mischaracterizing
candy's thinking
because
he referred to jack's tweet as a
tortured line of thinking
that since white applicants quote think
they get an advantage by lying then it
must be true
therefore structural racism doesn't
exist
now this is candy putting a ridiculous
argument into
jack's head
as if jack said it which is the typical
twitter way of arguing i guess
but here's the thing
um
is the problem that the white applicants
wrongly believe they'll get it
get a advantage because the story also
says 75 percent of the ones who use this
trick got accepted to college
but i don't know what is normal
you know if is it wrong for 75 percent
of the people who apply to college to
get accepted to some college
is that
is that even unusual because i would
think that the only people who apply to
colleges are people who have a
reasonable
expectation they could get accepted
and you usually only apply to colleges
you could get into right
like i did not apply to harvard
do you know why
i did not apply to
yale
guess why
couldn't get in
i mean it was obvious i couldn't get in
came from a very small town it wouldn't
matter it wouldn't have mattered
anything else you know where i came from
i couldn't have gotten in
but um
so so i asked for a clarification from
kendy so i tweeted this morning
i don't know if he'll respond i doubt it
but i'm actually curious
and i think you should be too
because what have i told you about
my excitement of being wrong
it excites me
i i don't run from being wrong
if i could learn something from it and
it would like blow my mind to find that
i'm wrong it would blow my mind to find
out
that
that white applicants don't have a
disadvantage in applying to college
but maybe
maybe i'm going to tell you i'm open to
the argument so if abraham candy
responds and i doubt he will but if he
does i'm open to the argument it's sort
of a data
the data exists or it doesn't
and can you find any data that would
suggest
that
the discrimination in college
applications specifically college
applications can we find that they
discriminate against people of color
or would we find that they discriminate
in favor of people of color
what do you think would you would find
what do you think
i think it's obvious that they
discriminate against white applicants
and i think i think all the data says
that
but
if candy thinks uh the opposite and he
he's sort of silent on this point
because i think what kennedy did was say
that jack had mischaracterized his point
to make it a larger point than he was
making and that i think kendy's point is
that white applicants were lying
not that it worked but that they were
lying
so i accept his clarification
if you reread the tweets
it does
seem to indicate he's talking more about
the lying
and does not have an opinion about
whether it worked
so i asked
what is his opinion did it work
because i think that's important to the
story right
and i'll give him i'll give him credit
this far
that jack did extend his point in other
words jack
attributed more of a point than can be
made and therefore the criticism is
slightly on a
related very closely related but not
quite exactly the same topic
you know one is did they lie
and the others did it work
slightly different but related
and i'll give them that i'll give kendy
that that minor detail but i think that
he's obligated at this point because
it's a public exchange
i would feel he's obligated to clarify
that in addition to
the fact that the white people lied
which i think we stipulate right
nobody's arguing at that point
um does he think that there really is no
advantage
to being a person of color in 2021
what do you think
to me it looks like it's obviously an
advantage i don't i can't even imagine
it not be true story when i was
i guess 17 or 18 i was applying for
colleges for the first time
i filled out
a document on ethnicity
and because we had been told in my
family that we were part native american
not much
but we were told we had some native
american
it turns out it was not true i have as
much native american as elizabeth warren
which is none
but apparently it's fairly common
and other people had the same story it
was fairly common in my generation
that families were told that they were
part native americans and it just wasn't
true
for some reason that was like a common
myth within families and our family was
one of them
so i had my
my
dna tested i don't have any native
american blood
but at the time i thought i did and so i
thought well wouldn't it be interesting
to fill out this application and it was
some generic thing that lots of colleges
saw i guess
i forget what it was but i put my
ethnicity down as native american
and my mailbox blew up
with offers for scholarships and
immediate acceptance
my ethnicity alone
got me
a scholarship offers
full ride
and acceptance
that's it
they just saw my ethnicity and said yep
you're in and
probably my
high school grades or something
now that was a long time ago
things could have changed a lot so i'm
not going to suggest things are the same
but
and by the way
just to finish the story i i did not
accept any of the offers that were based
on that
so i did not go to college based on a
fraud
but i did fill out a document
in a let's say cheeky way that a 17 year
old might
and it was just sort of an experiment i
guess
and uh it surprised me
i was surprised
so let's get to the bottom of that i
would like to hear it if it turns out
that i and 100 of every white person
i've ever met in my life is wrong
and that actually white people have a
big advantage in getting accepted into
college if i'm wrong about that
i damn well want to know
wouldn't you
could you imagine if you were wrong
about that
this is a good uh a good exercise
to keep you you know free from at least
a little bit free from cognitive
dissonance
because cognitive dissonance kicks in
when you find out you're wrong about
something
so it helps to protect yourself against
that to just
play it through with your mind like what
would it feel like to be wrong about
that
like something really basic that you
thought was true about the world and
what if you're wrong
it would kind of blow your mind wouldn't
it
and i think
that if you're an honest
you know participant in these
conversations you should at least
give the other side the courtesy of
saying you know i could be wrong
let's hear what you got and i'm going to
do that in this case
because
i don't know if you know this but
ibrahim kennedy is really smart
did you know that
um did he win a macarthur award or
something like that but i think he's
he's genuinely like seriously smart
so if he says that something is true
that i think is not true and it happens
to be his domain of expertise
i could be i could be influenced
i could change my mind on that
so
um i'd like to hear his argument
sincerely i think it'd be interesting
whether it's a good or bad argument i
figure he's a smart person with
something to say i'd like to hear it how
much would you like to hear me having an
interview with ibrahim kendy
how much would you like that
i think i think some of you would hate
it as much as you liked it because the
problem would be i would give too much
respect to his opinion and you don't
like his opinion
but i wouldn't interview anybody unless
i gave them full respect to their
opinion
otherwise why would i have mom you know
i'm not going to have somebody on who's
just a clown right
i'm going to respect the opinion or i'm
not going to have an interview
um
would you express your opinion of his
opinion i just did
i just did um i'll give you well maybe i
can extend that i'll make it larger
here's my opinion
of i guess the the candy
view of the world
uh i think he would say that the
structural or systemic racism is real
and so do i
i would say that the place that you can
fix it the the place has the biggest
lever
is in the school system
and that we should target that
collectively because both you know
basically every every ethnicity benefits
when you fix the bad schools
but the black population probably the
most just because where people live and
how bad the schools are
so we can certainly agree on that
i mean that's pretty big systemic racism
i would say
and the other arguments about systemic
racism is that anybody who has a head
start
has an advantage
how do you disagree with that
do you disagree with the notion that if
you have a head start
it's an advantage
who disagrees with that
and i would say that you know the legacy
of slavery did
give you know some white families a head
start not all of them and as soon as you
say it's about all white people it's
just stupid
right if you were born into a poor white
family
the legacy of being white didn't help
you as much as i should
but
now i think he would argue that
even if you're born a poor white person
and got no specific advantage
that the system would also give you
advantages just for the color of your
skin
that part
is part true and part false
i do believe that there are situations
in which
being white would give you an advantage
in american society
for example
do you think that people uh suspect me
of shoplifting
as much as
a black man of the same age you know
let's say at the same age any age do you
think i would have been suspected
of shoplifting at the same level
probably not so that would be you know
advantage scott right
but
if i were to apply for a job
at a fortune 500 company
who would
yeah i know i'm too old for the
shoplifting example but if i'm adjusting
it for my younger self
you seem pretty crafty
i don't know what that means is that
good or bad do you sport critical race
theory
no critical race theory is just
propaganda and brainwashing
and uh
probably 80 stupid
based on 20 pretty good stuff
so i don't disagree with the base
assumptions most of them some of them i
do but the base assumptions that there's
some inequality because of head starts
etc i just disagree that it's important
and where you would start
now the important part is if the world
gives everybody
you know good advantages then it's not
important
history doesn't matter because you can't
change it
right you're here now if you're here now
with the same opportunity as every other
poor person
i feel like i'm done you know you don't
need to talk anymore about it as long as
you gave everybody an opportunity but as
long as the school system is garbage for
black people specifically
and others but you know more more so
uh who doesn't want to fix that
who doesn't want to fix that and that's
mostly the teachers union so the problem
there
stop telling people they're screwed from
the get-go yeah you don't want to tell
people they're going to lose because the
way they were born
that is a bad strategy
did you look into the craig wright
now
why is this
is this just a twitter thing i've not
seen anything in the news about craig
ryan or satoshi anything
is there
somebody tweet me a news article on that
i've seen nothing on that in the news
i've only hear the only place i've ever
seen it
is in the comments here
uh somebody's saying most of the
shoplifters i've witnessed running for
stores were either young white males
or white women
in my town
my town is
you know upscale town in california
i would say our ethnic breakdown is
probably
60 percent white
30 percent
indian asian whatever you know however
you want to slice that
and maybe 10 black something like that
so that would be you know the town i
live in
um
and i would say that nearly 100 of the
shoplifters are white
nearly 100
because here
it's it's almost like a after-school uh
sport
the the kids leave the school they go to
the local
local grocery store and they shove stuff
in their pockets and they walk out
because like everywhere else they don't
the penalty is so small or non-existent
that
yeah right i don't live in oakland
you're correct
so
uh i think the majority of shoplifters
is whatever the majority of people in
your town is
uh
all right free reign yeah free range
shopping
people with trauma from neglect or abuse
are more likely to steal says somebody
i don't know
is there any data to back that up
yeah
all right
far more poor people are criminals well
that makes sense they should be
cvs shut down five stores i don't know
if that's real or they were shouting
down stores in general
the cvs story is a little murky
because we don't know if they were going
to shut some stores anyway
all right um
that is about what i had to talk about
today and uh
do you believe the rich slaves got to
keep their money
well
here's here's the provocative way that
you would analyze reparations i've said
this before but if somebody's new to it
if you were going to do an honest
economic analysis of reparations what
would you compare
the
let's say the black
experience and what they got and didn't
get through slavery etc what would you
compare it to
if you compare it to the white people in
america which is the way it's being done
then it looks like there's a gigantic
disparity and very unfair
but if you compared it to the actual
alternative
which is never being slaves
the actual comparison would be to people
who stayed in africa and just continued
living their normal life in africa
that's the comparison for financial
reasons
now for um
abuse
and uh you know the slavery part
that of course
you know you could you could make an
argument for
compensation for that
but i don't know that you could make
a rational argument
that black people were
were stolen from
except for their freedom i mean that's
obviously bigger than money
but
financially i don't think it's a
stealing situation because you would
compare it to what their alternative was
which may be even worse
not worse than slavery but
once once slavery was ended if you'd
have to compare them through history i
don't know who would do better
would a would a black man in 1965
america
have more or less
money and freedom than the african
uh
source tribe or whatever it was for
wherever he came culture
i don't know
but obviously you could make the
argument that the slavery itself
requires reparations independent of any
finances
now i'm not i'm not saying it's a good
idea but you could make the argument and
i i think it has been made
and yes black africans enslaved other
afghans yeah slavery is a universal
historical thing everybody enslaved
everybody basically everybody who could
enslave somebody did
that's pretty much the whole thing if
you could
well you did
um yes and as
as the comments are saying it's more
than slavery because there are the jim
crow laws and the discriminations
they're like yeah i i definitely uh
empathize with the argument
that they were suffering however
most of the people who suffered
you know the worst abuses have already
passed
but there are plenty of people alive who
went through you know
the worst of the earlier discrimination
in
in the last hundred years
um
if kennedy is correct why aren't
minority applicants lying to say they
are white i can answer that i can answer
it for can they if his belief is that
the white applicants are wrong
that they don't get and they don't get
any advantage from saying they're people
of color it means that students
can be wrong about what works and what
doesn't so that's your answer
you're saying why aren't the students
acting rationally if they could get an
advantage by doing x and i'm saying his
argument is that the students are not
acting rationally
they're acting poorly
but
i believe his argument would be they're
not acting in their best interest they
just don't realize it
and that would apply to any any kid
right
uh hello all you clankers
now do you clankers come over because
um
there was a retweet or another another
podcast ended
um
oh it's a raid from sticks and hammer
what does that mean a raid
does that mean that he tweeted something
and so you all came over here
or does it mean that his program just
ended and you're coming to another
program
i don't know what any of that means
just saying hi
hi
oh uh the clankers are liking the stream
stixx is live and he sends them oh okay
well that
is that is very nice of him tell him i
said thanks
and
all right good
good to know all right thanks for
watching um we didn't have too much news
today because maybe because it's
halloween so go out and have a uh
i will talk about the decentral land
um i see in the comments i'm being
prompted to do that but not today but i
will talk about that
and
um did i mention the southwest pilot
oh there was a southwest pilot for
saying uh let's go brandon
i guess he got fired you know i don't
disagree with that i don't disagree with
that firing i don't think that firing
was
inappropriate
i'm sorry
i think the employer can do anything
they want in protecting their brand
and if they thought that was bad for the
brand they might be right they might be
wrong but
it's their it's their call
was that good for the brand or bad for
the brand and i don't think putting
politics on a plane
is good for safety
think about it
what happens when you hear a political
something you know
obviously political from your pilot
do you think that gets the passengers
talking to each other
and arguing about whether that was right
or wrong
and suddenly the plane figures out who
is a trump supporter
and who's not and then you have to be on
a flight together for however long
i think it was dangerous i think it was
literally a safety problem to interject
politics in 2021
on a plane where people you know are in
a couldn't find space
so i'm going to back the airlines
for firing any pilot who makes a blatant
uh
one-sided political statement
sorry
you know because remember the airline
has rights too
i i'm very much in favor of free speech
and of course especially provocative
free speech but you don't get to do it
everywhere
right you don't you don't get to
embarrass your employer or create safety
problems
i would say that a pilot interjecting
um
let's go brandon
was similar not completely the same i
know there are differences
similar
to yelling fire in a crowded theater
because the the risk of violence from
that statement
in an enclosed space where people can't
just leave
is non-zero
it's not zero
i mean the the fire example would be
more dangerous i think but it's not zero
and i can see the airline saying i we
want our safety safety record to be
spotless
do you want your do you want your
airplane to be casual about safety
you don't right
it's the same as gun let me give an
analogy that you're gonna hate
now analogies are not persuasive because
you'll just argue about the analogy
but uh it's too much fun
so i'm gonna do it anyway what did gun
owners say when alec baldwin um
supporters said
well it maybe may not be alec baldwin's
fault because it was this you know
armorer who handed him the gun so it's
maybe that other person's fault what do
what does every
good gun owner say
i'm sorry that's an absolute
it's an absolute if it was in his hand
it's his responsibility
yes we hear your argument and we're not
listening to it it's an absolute
we're not going to be rational about
this did you hear the part where it's an
absolute has to be an absolute because
the moment you say there's an exception
to gun safety
somebody gets killed
just like the alec baldwin situation
that's why there's no exceptions because
the moment you make that exception
somebody dies
airline safety
should you make exceptions
yeah we're really big on airline safety
but you know we'll make an exception
you okay with that
no i think airline safety
and and firearm safety
should be absolutes
and every time you think that there
should be an exception to it you're
wrong
and the pilot situation goes into that
now i think
i hate the fact that he got fired like
from a on a human level
uh that just sucks right he was just
being interesting and fun
it was a bad decision
it had nothing to do with his flying
ability
i hope he gets another job and he's fine
but i kind of back i back southwest on
this i think treating safety as an
absolute is good for the brand good for
the passengers and good for the world
it just happened to be really bad for
one pilot and i i don't think it's fair
to him
but the world isn't fair it's not a fair
world right and unfortunately this went
his the wrong way
somebody says i disagree with your
framing as a safety issue that doesn't
matter really it doesn't matter
because it doesn't matter if you think
it's not a safety issue
the fact that i'm a reasonable person
who thinks that it is a safety issue
that means the southwest is completely
reasonable and saying you know people
are going to think it's a safety issue
even if we don't
because remember
safety is an absolute
so you have to treat it
like it's an absolute
and so they can't say well you know this
case
all right uh this is oh was he not fired
what happened to him
i'm getting a correction here on youtube
was he not fired
yeah it doesn't matter if it didn't
start any fights what matters is any
reasonable person would have said this
could cause trouble
a reasonable person could say this might
cause trouble and that that's it that's
the whole story if a reasonable person
could say you know this could cause a
problem
they gotta act on it
um
what if he made fun of the flat earth
well i don't know i'm not sure that
that hypothetical helps us
uh the flight was on the ground well
that doesn't matter does it
the flight was underground but it was
going to take off right
or had it already landed
in any case they're still you know
confined in that space so it's still
dangerous
um
shut up and fly the plane
all right that's all and i will talk to
you tomorrow have a great halloween
everybody
