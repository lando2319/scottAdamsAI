all right i know what you're
used to what you usually see
when you come here to visit me at this
exact time every day
is you think you're going to have the
best time of your day
because that's what the simultaneous sip
is really every time
but today it's going to be better than
that i'm going to give you
the only thing that's better than the
simultaneous sip
are you ready the only thing that's
better than the simultaneous sip
i'm just kidding there's nothing better
than this simultaneous sip
come on get out of here let's have it
let's have at it all you need is a cover
bugger a glass of tanker trowels or
steiner canteen jugger flask have a
vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hint of the day
the thing that makes
everything better including autocorrect
pandemics pretty much everything
go
all right somebody was making me laugh
in the comments because
yesterday uh autocorrect played a little
joke on me
so i had i had author bjorn
lomborg on periscope yesterday most of
you saw it
and when i typed in the title into
periscope periscope changed it to
lamborghini so i can't really edit it
after it's published in periscope you
can change it in youtube and other
places
but in periscope you can't really go
back and change it because it's like a
tweet
so i i have somebody on to promote his
book and i
i don't even get his name right but i'll
correct that now it's lemberg
not lamborghini is lomborg
all right you probably are all aware
that twitter got
hacked and boy did twitter get hacked
talk about a good hack i'm kind of you
know do you ever have that feeling when
you hear a
about a really good serial killer
i'm not proud of this but every now and
then
i'll hear a story about some serial
killer who
you know built an underground bunker to
keep his victims and he had a plan and
he operated for years
and i'll have two different feelings
about it one
well that's awful that's that's the
worst thing
you know i've heard today that's that's
one feeling
and then the other feeling i get is
that's kind of industrious
you know if i'm being fair
you know he's not lazy he's you know
he's gonna executing a plan
maybe a systems over goals kind of guy i
don't know
but i'm always impressed when uh when
people put a little
little effort into it all right um
and these hackers for uh for twitter
they had a really good plan the plan was
and i guess it worked
they somehow allegedly we don't know if
this part is true yet but there's some
suggestion that they may have bribed
somebody within twitter to give them
some access they took over some accounts
some big ones like biden elon musk
and then they tweeted from their
accounts as if
they had been tweeting and they tweeted
that uh
if for on behalf of some fake charity
that if you would send them two thousand
dollars no one thousand dollar in
bitcoin
you would get back two thousand dollars
now
i don't know how many people in the
world are dumb enough to fall for that
but it turns out it's at least a hundred
so if you're wondering to yourself scott
that you said that was a clever plan
that's not a clever plan who in the
world would be dumb enough
to send some a stranger or a strange
charity a thousand dollars on the
in the hopes that they would send you
two thousand dollars back
that doesn't even make sense
well it turns out if enough people see
that offer you're gonna get a few
hundred
and that's what happened and the the
brilliance of the plan
is that because the tweeting came from
uh well-established accounts
that would not scam you you thought well
elon musk isn't gonna you know run some
scam and
joe biden isn't gonna run some scam in
the middle of an election
but there it was now what's interesting
is
um you may not know this but joe biden
is not
actually the only person who's running
for president this year
there's this other guy you've heard of
him trump
and uh what does it tell you that biden
was selected but trump wasn't
now it could be it could be that yeah
there's a political element to this but
probably not
here's what i think i think they thought
biden would be more convincing
i think they just figured that biden
would be
more likely to do this and that people
would trust biden
more than trump if it looks suspicious
and they're probably right
so that was a clever hacker plan
probably more clever
hacking than it was
anything political all right
there are news stories about the
so-called refrigerated
trucks to put all the bodies from the
coronavirus deaths
you've heard the refrigerated truck
story before
maybe it's true this time maybe it was
true the other time
but what do i tell you about persuasion
i tell you that if you can't make it
visual it's not nearly as good
so compare these two versions of a story
one hospitals are impacted
they're overloaded people are you know
there's lots of pressure on them
etc all right so that's sort of the
generic
conceptual description of what's
happening in the hospitals
compared to uh three refrigerated
trucks pulled up to hold all the bodies
right those are not comparable one of
them
is a movie because you can actually see
the trucks pulling up in your head
that's that's persuasive if you can see
it as a movie
you're already half persuaded if it's a
concept
your brain doesn't hold and it doesn't
stick to things as well because you want
to
activate your visual part of your brain
to to get something done
so i would ask you
how true is it that these refrigerated
trucks are really
going to be used and they really exist
i think in in today's world you just
have to doubt that
that doesn't mean it's untrue if it
turns out that they're really used
that would be terrible and and i would
say oh okay well that's that's what they
reported
but you have to at least put a little
bit of skepticism in this story i don't
know how much
25 minimum i would say i would say
dial up your skepticism to at least 25
percent
on the refrigerated corpse
trucks which might be totally real 75
chance but i don't know
um i am amazed at agog
i don't know what a gog means exactly
but i think i'm a gog alexa
define a gog
as an adjective
curiosity eagerness and curiosity
yes okay okay
all right that's enough calm down
all right uh with the eager curiosity
uh i look at these stories about uh that
they seem to be settled now so
apparently
gun purchases are way up
and in the past when there have been gun
purchases
because you know whenever there's a big
story in the news about any
any kind of upheaval in this country
there
there always are more gun purchases but
in the past apparently those gun
purchases were primarily
uh they were primarily for people who
already own guns
this time 40 of the gun purchases are
people who never owned a gun before
40 what does that mean
40 are new gun owners somebody asked
online um somebody asked how many of
them were democrats
i would also ask how many of them did i
answer a poll
but here's the part that's amazing the
the gun debate is just over
but there are no stories about the gun
debate being over
because it'll be kind of embarrassing
now if you can think way way way back to
a year ago
and beyond
i'm pro-second amendment pro-gun and
although i'm left of uh bernie
in general i describe myself that way uh
gun gun ownership is one of those things
that
isn't really left or right a gun is a
tool
would you agree that even thinking of
guns as a political
topic doesn't exactly make sense to me
because i don't think that my my hammer
or my saw
are political right i just think of them
as tools
and a firearm for self-defense
is just a tool so i don't really think
of that as either left or right which is
why i give myself the freedom
to just say well all right is it a tool
i need is it a tool i might need
is it a tool anybody needs so that's the
only way i think of guns
i don't think of it politically and one
of the biggest arguments was
what happens if the government goes bad
and
tries to take over the citizens and
become a dictatorship
and people would argue well it's a good
thing we all have guns because that
would make that less likely
and other people would argue no you
can't go up against the government
because they have
tanks and nuclear weapons and stuff to
which i've always said
that's not what the fight looks like
that's not what it would look like
what are you imagining are you imagining
a line of tanks and soldiers on the
right
and then the left a bunch of citizens
with their handguns and you know some
some rifles and stuff that's not what's
going to happen
if there were any kind of a dictatorship
kind of takeover
it would be more house to house if you
know what i mean
so anybody who was on the side of the
government would get a visit
by their neighbors you know what i'm
saying it would be nothing like
some big battle it would be
let's visit your neighbor because uh
your neighbor has a family member who's
on the dictator side that's what it
would be
and and that would be enough to keep the
dictator in control
because the citizens would would have
just too much power
one of the things i had not specifically
thought of
but now you can't unthink it is what
happens if there's a civil
war that just comes from the citizens
themselves
because that's sort of the the feeling
that you're getting with these protests
is this is approaching something like a
civil war
my opinion is it's not and that
your your feeling about it is way
overblown but
it feels like that and uh
anybody who's lived through this period
is done with the the gun conversation
it's just over
and i don't even think i would address
anybody who wanted to talk about it at
this point
it feels like it is so off the table
that if somebody said scott
do you want to come and represent one
side in the gun debate
here would be my answer what gun debate
what gun debate are you talking about oh
you mean in the past
do you have a time machine where i can
go back in the past
and have a debate back when there was
actually something to debate
there's no longer a debate this
ended it but the other one that
that may have ended recently in a very
quiet way
is climate change have you heard of
climate change climate change
just got a little uh gut punch by joe
biden being in favor of nuclear energy
do you know who else is in favor of
nuclear energy
the trump administration and the the
department of energy
working quite aggressively for nuclear
energy
do you know what everybody who can
actually do math and science
do you know what they think is really
the only way you're going to get to some
kind of a
uh no carbon situation
nuclear pretty much i mean everybody's
in favor
i think of doing more research and if
you could figure out
you know better batteries or better
energy or something
sure sure everybody's in favor for that
but at the same time if you're not doing
nuclear
well you're not trying that hard you're
not really serious
so i think the the climate change
argument
just sort of disappeared and it got
attacked from two different directions
in a very important way direction number
one
is what are you going to do about it
right so there's
so how bad is it and what are you going
to do about it are the two questions
about climate change would you agree
how bad is it what are you going to do
about it the what are you going to do
about it
apparently is roughly the same on the
left and the right
right because biden did not take the
extreme
green new deal stuff like getting rid of
airplanes he just
made some aggressive goals that are you
know so many years in the future that
you don't even care about the deadline
it doesn't even mean anything so far in
the future
and it's just not that different the way
it feels from what the republicans are
already doing
now sure there might be some more
investment in green stuff
but i don't know has anything as much
come out of it yet
i'm not sure that the citizens will see
much of a difference anymore but here's
the other part
so that's that's the what do you do
about it part the other part is
how bad is it which you know drives what
do you do about it
and that's where i think these two books
that i've talked about this week
you know bjorn lomborg's book and here's
the important part
and this is the same with michael
sheldenberger's
book apocalypse never which i talked
about earlier
both books are in the same let's say
family of criticism
which is yes humans are
warming the earth so both of them start
with that assumption
this is a big deal they start with the
assumption that yeah it's true humans
are warming the earth
but then they make a far stronger
argument both
uh bjorn lomborg and michael
schelmenberger
both of them with new books and both of
them will make a big impact
and it's just eviscerating the argument
that there's a problem as big as they
say
they've just eviscerated it and as long
as these two books are out there and
people like you are willing to tell
people hey check out these books
you're really completely eliminating the
how big a problem is it part of the
equation at the same time you're saying
it's not that big of a problem if we do
everything right and by the way
we're doing everything right because we
kind of are
which is pursuing every form of energy
fairly aggressively is exactly what you
should do every form of cleaner energy
so i would say that climate change
just went from the biggest problem in
the world
to oh that looks like that's heading in
the right direction
so a lot of the a lot of the energy is
just going to come right out of it i
think
education is continuing to evolve and
i'm loving the conversations
where people are really starting to
let's say
they're trying they're picking it apart
to redesign it
a lot a lot of us are doing that in our
minds but they're
no doubt lots of people working very
hard to figure out
which part of the education is the
important part
which is really an interesting process
isn't it
if you think that the education system
just was you know designed
hundreds of years ago and just evolved a
little bit
and still basically reading and writing
and sitting in the classroom
and listening to a teacher and the fact
that we're picking that apart now and
saying all right
throw away all the assumptions maybe it
doesn't need to be a teacher
maybe they don't need to be in the same
place what about these classes do you
need a college education ivanka says
companies will change
train you to do the specific job
so having everything in question
about maybe the most important thing
that society does which is
educate because everything everything
good follows from that right
you know once you get your people up to
speed
good people create good outcomes so the
fact that our most
basic and important and i would say our
alpha
our alpha system
can i call it that the the the or the
apex
system the system that makes all the
other systems work
education is now going to really
probably
have a complete overhaul i think here
here's my
uh suggestion for how to improve it i
don't know if this is
high school or this is college or maybe
it doesn't matter
but here are the here are the class
categories
that i would have this is sort of
evolving over time so you've heard a
little of this
one would be a class on or maybe it's
even a major
on life strategy things that you would
see
in such as in my book had a failed
almost everything and still win big
where i teach things like systems are
better than goals and skill stacks are
good
so knowing knowing the user interface
for life
feels like that just should be a course
or even a major
that's so important because if you don't
get the basics of oh wait how does the
world work
if you do more of this and less of this
do you get a better result
the answer is if you know which button
yes but you got to know which button to
push
i would have a course on how to make
decisions
um i do that a little bit of that in my
book loser think
actually that's mostly what the book is
about but that could be
taken further if you look at
most of the problems in the news today
from guns to green
technology to racism to everything else
they all seem to have a common problem
what is the common problem with you know
everything guns racism green technology
the common problem is
that the differences in our opinions are
differences in ability to analyze
they're not actually political opinions
these are fake
disagreements if people knew how to
analyze things
properly they just knew how to compare
two things
you know can i compare this pen to this
pencil
now you think it's common sense well you
know you don't need to take a class
to compare a pencil to a pen it's just
obvious
and that's where everybody goes wrong
because it's not
it's just not you've got to take into a
lot of a lot of things into
account to do a proper comparison
and you do need to learn it it's not
something that's common sense
i would have a course on persuasion
similar to my book win bigly
because if you can't persuade you can't
get much done can't get a job
can't sell something you can't get a
mate you know
persuasion is pretty important and then
computer communication in general which
persuasion might be a subset of so
that's what i would teach and then maybe
entrepreneurship so a little bit about
how would you start a business if you
wanted to and what would you need to do
if you started a business
you know what's a corporation what's a
partnership
just some basics and these would be my
at least the beginning of a core
platform
now obviously you need the reading and
writing and science
background etc so you need you need some
basics but this is where i'd go
uh here's a little thing that you don't
learn in school
but look just consider if you will
i'm going to give you a little tip on
one topic
that is not covered in school and yet it
could be one of the most
basic important skills that a person can
have
and most of you are not good at it but
you could be
and with maybe half an hour of of
instruction
and that is sleep sleep
should be considered a skill
not the default condition of your body
when it's night and you're tired we kind
of think of
of sleep as just the thing that sort of
happens at night and
how hard is it you know there's no skill
involved in sleeping
but there is now there may not have been
skill involved in sleeping in the past
because it was a simpler world and
things weren't complicated
maybe it was different i don't know
maybe people didn't drink as much coffee
in the caveman days
but in the modern days sleep is so
important to your performance
and really your whole quality of life
then if you don't do it right it makes a
big difference
and you should now i've given you sleep
tips before but here's a new one
and this won't work for everyone this is
a sleep tip
that worked for me i would be interested
if any of you want to
try it out with the open-mindedness of
well if this doesn't work
you know i lost a week of trying
something that didn't didn't hurt me
right so i'd like you to just try it
but you know some of you this won't work
you'll know if you'll know if you're one
of the people that it works for
it goes like this if i go to bed and
i can't sleep because i'm just too wound
up
here's what i tell myself you probably
tell yourself
or the average person would say darn it
i can't sleep
i can't sleep what happens when you tell
yourself over and over again you can't
sleep
well it doesn't help doesn't help so
that would be
a bad mindset let me tell you what i do
when i can't sleep
because because my body is just wound up
and i'm not ready to sleep
i tell my body that i didn't work hard
enough that day
now your immediate reaction should be uh
why does that work
you need a little more explanation right
it goes like this
it helps me not a bit that night so
that night i'm just going to struggle to
fall asleep
so that tip doesn't help me one bit the
day that i say it to myself
i didn't work hard enough but the next
day
it's like seven o'clock at night and
i'll say to myself ah
i have not exercised today i got busy
i wanted to but i didn't so now you say
all right i would never exercise at
seven o'clock
at night but i'm not going to be laying
in bed again tonight
and tell myself i didn't work hard
enough so
workout clothes on hit the road walk run
ride your bike lift some weights go to
the gym
back when people had gyms and they could
go to them and they didn't die from
going to the gym
so that mindset if you start programming
it into yourself
will cause your day to be more
productive because instead of saying
what's the easiest way i can get through
things
you'll start managing your energy in a
way
that by the time you hit the bed at
whatever your bedtime is 10 o'clock
you're only going to want to sleep i
i push myself to the point where i know
i will sleep well
that's one of the ways i manage energy
i've said before
and a lot of people have found this very
useful that you should not manage your
time you should manage your energy
now of course you have to manage your
time to show up to appointments
but think in terms of managing your
energy
to to create the best energy for the
task
and then to make sure that you've used
your energy up
by the end of the day when it's time to
go to bed and that you haven't used it
up at noon
because it's going to be a tough day you
use it all up early
but you've you've made sure that you did
a physical
physical work and mental work that will
get you in the sleeping
point of view so that's the advice sleep
is a skill and that skill starts when
you wake up
right so your skill of sleeping at night
starts when you wake up and you manage
your energy
in your day to get yourself in the right
condition to sleep it's
an all day process so if anybody tries
that let me know if it works for you
i think it's the kind of framing that
will appeal to some kind of
uh mindsets that are already
already in in place it won't work for
everybody
all right um tony schwartz who's some
kind of a political commentator i think
he's on msnbc
he said this in a tweet it might sound
like a familiar sounding tweet
who who has ever said something vaguely
similar to this before see if it rings
any bells
he said in a tweet tony schwartz did if
somehow
some way trump is re-elected i won't
consider it safe to continue to live in
the united states
that will be true i believe for many of
those who have publicly
opposed trump does that sound familiar
it's kind of what i said if biden won
the election now let's compare thee to
assertions so i've said that trump
supporters
would be unsafe in a world in which
biden became president and let's say the
left became
emboldened and tony schwartz is making
the exact
same claim except saying that it would
be
unsafe to be a vocal democrat
in a world where trump is reelected
which of those claims
seems more true would it be more
dangerous to be on the left or more
dangerous on the right if you're not the
one
whose preferred candidate is in power
well how can we figure out which of
those
seems more reasonable is there any kind
of
test you could do before the election
to see what the mood is in the country
well i would suggest a test how about
tony schwartz
uh puts on a uh mega hat
and goes to a public place and then i
will do the i'll do the opposite
i'll wear a biden bite it for president
hat
and i will visit the same public place
or
or any other place in fact i'll go
further
i will put on the joe biden hat and i
will attend
a trump rally in a joe biden for
president hat
and i will be completely safe
let's just try it let's let's make it
more fun
let's say that tony schwartz has to wear
a
make america great again hat to a
biden uh event if there ever is one
it's not on televised uh that's not just
digital
and so he'll take a mag ahead to a
democrat event
and i'll wear a joe biden hat to a mega
trump event and we'll just do an
experiment
and see who gets the shipping out of
them
i'm going to go out on the limb and say
that
i would give some mocking and i would
get some looks
from going to a trump rally
but i'll also bet you that the people
who were mocking
and maybe looking at me at the trump
wait for it
are smiling right
if you went to a trump rally wearing a
biden hat the first thing people would
do when they saw you is they would smile
because they would think it was funny
they would think
it was funny and they might say hey what
are you doing here you're in the wrong
rally
and give me a hard time would i ever
feel physically threatened
at a trump rally not even a little bit
wearing a biden hat not even a little
bit it wouldn't feel
the slightest bit physically dangerous
but of course they'd give me a hard time
but i guarantee they would be smiling
when they did it
do you think it would work the same way
the other way i don't think so
all right um
let's see uh have you watched a
interview on live video with trump's
niece mary trump
who uh who's got a book
that is critical of her uncle donald
trump
how many of you have seen her on video
i i don't want to be unkind
i'm just going to say this
you should see her i think she talked to
george stephanopoulos so there's some
clips
i'm just going to say this you should
spend
10 seconds looking at a clip of her
talking
and again i won't be unkind i'm just
suggesting
it's worth 10 seconds of your time and
i'm not even going to give you my
opinion of her book
because in 10 seconds of listening to
her talk
you will have the same opinion i do
[Laughter]
so i don't need to talk you into
anything just spend 10
seconds see if you can get the vibe of
what's going on here
see if you could just get a feel for the
person
and then you're going to have the same
opinion i do
and i'm not even going to state it brad
parskal
apparently has been replaced as the head
of the campaign for trump
we don't know what is behind that but if
you believe rumors on
on twitter there might be some
personal relationship situation going on
there
uh not between trump and parscale but
there might be something personal going
on and
one wonders how
i especially wonder when there is a
suggestion
and i don't know who put this idea into
the public's mind
can somebody tell me where did this idea
come from
like why are people even thinking this
there there's
some kind of a widespread thought that
there are these secret trump supporters
that are lying to pollsters where does
the public get ideas like this
it's crazy oh wait i might have been
part of that um
this is how this is how cnn
writes a headline for a story about the
the belief by belief by voters
that there are shy trump supporters it's
called
2020's latest boogie band secret trump's
voters 2020's latest boogie band so i
guess
that means that if you're a democrat
the republicans are trying to scare you
by telling you that there's this
boogeyman
in the form of these hidden trump voters
that are going to get you
they're going to get you they're hiding
and
there was a monmouth mon mouth poll
maybe you heard of it
in which they gave joe biden a 13-point
lead in pennsylvania
so you say wow he's really doing great
in these competitive states
and then uh but then they also asked
pennsylvanians
uh whether they thought there was a
secret trump voter out there
you know a lot of them and 57
believe there's there are hidden trump
voters
57 of pennsylvania's
pennsylvanians think their neighbors
are lying to pollsters
57
but then cnn after giving it a headline
calling it a boogeyman
which would suggest it's not real
further down in the story on their
website they say
the idea of quote secret voters is not
entirely far-fetched
in the aftermath of trump's 2016 win one
study suggested
quote the people who kept their vote a
secret overwhelmingly voted for trump
did you need to see a survey to tell you
that the people who wouldn't tell you
who they were voting for
voted for trump look at all the uh
look at all the undecided voters how
many undecideds are there or let's say
independents because independents are
really fake undecideds they're really
decided they just
pretend they're not
somebody says 43 of pennsylvania voters
are poorly informed
that sounds about right anyway uh we'll
see how big that
boogeyman is uh because
you know i i can't get past this see if
i'm on the wrong page with this
the the reason that i think the the
hidden trump vote
is bigger than it was in 2016 and and
potentially really really big two
reasons one
it's more and more obvious that it could
be physically dangerous
and economically dangerous to admit
you're a trump supporter
so the first thing is that the danger
has gone up what do you agree
the danger has increased for admitting
your trump supporter
so if nothing had changed but that there
should be
more hidden trump supporters this year
than 2016.
but that's not the only thing that
happened another thing that needs to
happen
for persuasion is to
think about it you have to actually
think of it
so if nobody had ever suggested
hey maybe you could just lie to the
pollster
if nobody had ever suggested that then
people would have to think of it
themselves
some of them would some of them would
just say i'm not comfortable with this
and they would just naturally
lie to the pollsters but what happens
when you suggest it
what happens when you put it out there
as a national story
you know last time there were a lot of
people hiding and how'd that turn out
for the people who were hiding
how did it turn out for the people who
were hiding
you know the secret trump supporters in
2016.
the way it turned out was better than
anything that ever they've ever seen in
their life
politically the the unexpected win
of trump and the night that you learned
it and the way that you felt if you were
a trump supporter
and especially if you were a hidden
trump supporter
was something that i would describe as
really really good
you would feel really really good like
your whole body would feel good
you would be exploding with uh you know
dopamine
and serotonin and whatever else makes
you feel good
those people got a physical reward
that lasted for months you know speaking
for myself
from the day of that surprise trump
victory
and i had more more skit in the game
because i had been publicly
predicting it for so long but the
feeling of that you got
with that surprise victory it lasted
months
now all of the people who lied in 2015
and 16
do you think they're lying again of
course
of course why wouldn't they because
their reasons to lie
are better than ever and it worked out
and
if the prank works again because the
first time i think it was just people
hiding
but this time there's another motivation
the prank right the prank
is really attractive and the prank
is the surprise because as much fun as
you had
when it looked like hillary clinton had
a 90 percent chance of winning
toward the end and oops there you go i
guess 90
wasn't good enough we're heading toward
a place where the polls are so wide
that on election day it might be a 99.99
predicted result that biden will win
how will democrats feel if there's a
99.99
prediction from the experts that biden
will win
and trump wins again again
how are the how are how are they
how are they going to take it the
democrats well
you're everybody remembers these
screaming voters the democrats who lost
you know that there's this famous iconic
picture of the
the woman going ah and uh
being upset you can't tell me if you're
a trump supporter you haven't looked at
that picture 100 times since 2016 and
laughed every time
every time so
the situation is sort of picture perfect
for the biggest prank ever played
in political history if this is what it
looks like
and it definitely looks like it to me i
i think it's hard to say
that's definitely what it is you know we
don't live in a world of certainty
but if i were gonna have to put money on
it i would say that the
hidden trump supporter is far and way
bigger this time
than it was last time and maybe bigger
than any election ever
because there's a genuine fear it's in
people's minds it's a bigger fear than
it was before
and the prank the prank of it
just the surprise that could be coming
just could be the funniest thing you've
ever experienced in your whole freaking
life
honestly and that's so attractive
we'll see so here's how
uh cnn handled an interview that
um president trump did in which he was
asked about was it was it catherine
herridge or somebody asked him this
question
um so here's the headline from cnn
trump gets upset when asked about police
killing black americans
what what would you think the story is
going to say
if the headline is trump gets upset when
asked about police killing black
americans
doesn't the headline suggest that the
president doesn't care
about police killing black americans
that doesn't feel like they're
they don't say that but the ways phrase
is sort of suggesting
that they can tell his attitude and that
he doesn't really care about black
people being killed by police
but is that what happened well let's
talk about what actually happened
so during an interview this is from cnn
with cbs news
president donald trump responded to a
question about why black americans are
still dying at the hands of law
enforcement by saying
quote more white people are killed by
police
and calling the question terrible now of
course they took him out of context
so that you wouldn't know exactly why he
was saying the question was terrible
it's a little unclear so they they've
mucked up
the their description so you don't know
what he was really getting it
right they just took the meaning out of
it and put their own meaning on it
now if you saw live what he was getting
at is that the terrible part
is that you would focus on only the
deaths of one group of people
when the larger group of people were
white
is that an unfair thing for a president
to say
maybe we should focus on the largest
group of people who are getting killed
not the smaller group or maybe we should
at least include the larger group in the
conversation he didn't say you should
focus on the larger group
he said it should be in the conversation
which is completely fair
so how did caitlyn whatever
on cnn report on that she summed up the
piece
because it was part of a video package
on jake tapper's show
and she sums it up by saying that
police kill black americans at a rate of
3.5 times
more than whites is that true
no it's fake news because she does the
same data analysis
mistake that caused all the protests
it's the same mistake do you think it's
a really a mistake
or do you think it's a it's an
intentional lie
well what she says is technically
correct
but it's used to mislead obviously and
i'll tell you why
so that what she's doing is saying that
if you just look at the percentage of
the population
black citizens are killed at 3.5 times
more
higher rate than whites that's true
it's also the wrong thing to measure
because the only
police are not stopping people for no
reason and killing them
they're only the only time that anybody
gets killed is if they have a police
encounter
so the only thing you should count is
the number of police encounters
if you do that it turns out white and
black deaths are comparable
as a percentage so she's simply making a
data analysis
error that you have to ask yourself
is she really so dumb that she doesn't
know
she's doing this i don't know
do you is i forget caitlyn's last name
caitlyn something that
corresponded the white house
correspondent for cnn
caitlin collins uh caitlin collins
i can't tell if she's actually not good
at analyzing
or or she's intentionally ignoring the
useful number in favor of the one that
just causes riots
and is not useful i don't know
um and so the question i ask for you is
this
you know we're we're big on free speech
and should be
but doesn't this get really close to
shouting fire
in a uh crowded movie theater
so you know the old uh the old saying
that we have freedom of speech but you
still can't yell
fire in a crowded theater because that
kind of speech
would certainly cause people to be hurt
you know as they try to get out of the
theater and
there'd be pandemonium so if we take
as a standard that you have complete
freedom of speech unless
unless it's going to immediately cause
people to hurt themselves
that's sort of that where we draw the
blind no no no you can't you can't do
something that people can get
killed that's that's not the free speech
we're talking about
but here cnn is spreading a
obviously fake or you know misleading
data
that is driving protests looting and
deaths
all over the country why is it legal
think about it why is it why is it legal
for cnn
to report data that clearly drives
protests and violence all over the
country while we're having it
it's not even a hypothetical theoretical
question
it's happening right now and they put
this on the air
as a respectable allegedly news
organization
it is really close to yelling fire in a
crowded theater isn't it
because imagine if they had said this i
know it's hard to imagine
but imagine if they had said this if you
look at the number of police stops it's
fairly comparable and we haven't asked
anybody in black lives matter to respond
to that
but we'd like to get an interview on
that
how different would the world be if cnn
were reporting the data analyzed
correctly
pretty different yeah it seems that cnn
has blood on their hands
the trouble is that you could take this
argument pretty far and it would close
down the news business
because it would be easy to say well
what about
what about hannity saying something
medical
that people believed to which i'd say
good point right yeah
the the trouble is that if you made it
actually illegal to do that
what cnn is doing that is clearly
killing people
you'd have to extend that to
the news saying anything that gets
people killed and unfortunately is so
common both on the left and the right
that you know not not because they're
necessarily doing it intentionally
although i think cnn is doing this
intentionally that would be my guess
it's hard to know but it feels
intentional
because i'd hate to think they're this
dumb what do you think
do you think caitlyn collins actually
doesn't know
that she is analyzing the wrong do you
think she doesn't know
in the comments tell me your opinion
because we can't read her mind and i'm
i'm trying to catch myself from doing
the thing i most criticize
and other people which is no you're not
a mind reader you don't know what a
stranger is thinking
so i'm gonna i'm gonna pull back
my statement that it seems obvious it's
intentional
because i'm not sure it is obvious i
don't know that it is obvious
i'm looking at your comments yes no no
of course they know yes they know dumb
uh swalwell secretly loves goya beans
okay that's kind of funny she doesn't
know she doesn't know
others saying it's intentional clueless
50 50. she knows she knows i think they
know
she's not trained yeah so
she may not have the type of uh
analytical
background necessary but i wonder if
she's ever even heard the argument
because i even wonder that don't you it
makes sense that people who only watch
cnn don't see the arguments on fox
but do the commentators and the
professionals who actually work there
do they also not see the argument on the
other side
they somebody says she has a boss that's
true
yeah katelyn collins has a boss and cnn
you know is coordinated enough
that if anybody at cnn knew it was wrong
she would hear about it right if anybody
as cnn knew that number was wrong
they'd tell somebody else and say hey
hey i heard you say that on the air
you should correct that so does nobody a
cnn know that's wrong
yeah that would be a bigger reach
wouldn't it all right
that is what i have to say for
today i would like to give you
a little uh a little encouragement
uh ask yourself who have been your most
reliable public figures
one of the things i told you early on
was
when the when the pandemic first started
closing things down
one of the things i told you is that
nobody in the united states
would starve right i told you that
directly i said no
no risk nobody's going to starve in this
country
nobody did now it's it's you know it's
hard
but everybody's eaten i told you that
we would probably be able to borrow or
not borrow necessarily but
print money massively because we're in
this unique situation where
demand is so low that inflation can't
happen and that's the main reason you
don't want to print money
sure enough we printed gazillions of
dollars
and nobody's nobody's you know sounding
the warning about inflation
because i had accurately deduced that we
could just print money and print our way
out of it
in this weird unique situation that's
exactly what happened
who told you uh way before we started
getting serious about china
that china was an enemy not a trading
partner
i did i told you that two years before
it became obvious to basically
the entire united states who told you
that when the recovery started the
economic recovery
that it would be faster than the experts
predicted i did i
the president did too but i told you
clearly and often
when the recovery starts it's going to
be
impressive in a way you've never seen
before it'll be it'll be jaw-dropping
and it is right so
when you were following me in the in my
when i was doing my evening
uh periscopes a lot of what i was doing
is trying to
um try to talk you off the ledge the
things aren't as bad as they look
and i and the reason i'm pointing this
out is not just to brag although
bragging is good
i'm never i'm never opposed to bragging
if you ever see
if you ever hear me say anything like
that i would be lying
i do think that it is functional and
useful
for people to especially in the public
to tell you what they got right
as i get things wrong i'll tell you that
too i'll probably spend less time
telling you what i got wrong
why wouldn't i um but
but but think about that now the other
thing that
i said um i didn't say it often but
those of you are regulars will back me
up i also said
you better not wait for a vaccine uh
yeah vaccinations you better not wait
for medical science because i don't
think you're going to have a
vaccination you know in time to save the
economy etc
and then we're just going to have to
live with the virus and it looks like
it looks like the situation is we're
simply going to have to adapt
to living with the virus until who knows
you know maybe it's a year and a half
from now when we've got something
so yeah the stock market's at an
all-time high
and here's the other thing which i
predicted it'll take a little bit longer
for this to
unwind which is the total shaking of the
box of the economy and the rethinking of
everything from education to
the food supply to really everything
uh the rethinking of all that will
actually be an economic
stimulus because it creates all all
kinds of new businesses to wind up etc
so i think the economy is going to be a
good spot
i think that um there really isn't much
option except to live with uh a
grotesque amount of
coronaviru deaths and we're just going
to deal with it
because we're at war we're at war with a
virus
and it's the weirdest kind of war
because the civilians are all in
and the and the most vulnerable among us
are on the front lines in a sense
because they have the most vulnerability
so somebody says it's too soon to tell
about inflation that is correct
you always have that risk of future
inflation but
let me say this as clearly as possible
if we get to the point where inflation
is a problem
we've really done well yeah
now moderna has a vaccine
that they think will work looks
promising need a little extra testing
we'll see how that goes fingers crossed
and uh
the election will be the end i don't
know what that means oh and
you mean if a uh democrat gets elected
yeah
so let me update the slaughter meter the
slaughter meter
is at 100
uh if nothing changed between now and
election
the slaughter meter says there's 100
chance of trump being reelected
but of course lots of things will change
so it's not a prediction
it's just a fun little point in time
that says unless something changes
but it will change we the last time i
mean i started doing the
slaughter meter always with the the
caveat that
until something changes and it will
before the corona virus
i mean really it was so obvious that
there would be big things between
you know now and november but i didn't
think it would be that big
why should we have to live with the
deaths other countries are managing it
much
better let me answer it this way
there's other countries that have gotten
it under control
it's not going to stay that way there is
no scenario
that anybody can think of in which the
countries that get it under
control don't lose control of it pretty
soon
you get that right if any country got
their
infections down to zero they would also
have to close
all travel it's the only way it would
stay to zero
and the first thing you do when you're
you know when you get it down to zero is
you say hey let's open things up
if there's any international travel the
odds of all the countries getting the
infections under control is zero there's
no chance
there's there's no plan there's nobody
has a way to do that
nothing there's nothing you can do
all right so slaughter meter at one
hundred percent until something changes
but you know it will
and that's all i got for today and i'll
talk to you later
