that's at all
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a finer time in your
life would you like to take that
experience up the levels that nobody's
ever seen before sure you do all you'd
use a cup of Margaret glass that Tankard
Chelsea style the canteen yoga flask or
the vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopa media the day the thing that
makes everything better is called
the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
now your life is complete
yeah
you know if you'd like to be called One
in a Million
has anybody ever said that about you
you know you're you're one in a million
well you could be one in a million if
you follow me on Twitter because now we
have a million followers you can be one
One in a Million
sounds better than it is
all right I've got an idea for an app
but first I'll tell you that uh there's
a Twitter user called Maurice creme who
follows Ai and he gave a handy list of
which AI models to use for what things
so for internet tasks uh he thinks Bard
would be good hard
for writing tasks gpt4 for coding code
interpreter for analyzing long PDFs
Claude 2 harder reasoning tests gpt4
data analysis code interpreter Etc
and I said to myself
you know what we really need
we need some kind of app
that will tell you what the other apps
do because they're all changing all the
time
and
let's call it a concierge app
concierge app you should have one app
that you can say hey do something for me
and then that app like a concierge would
behind the scenes go use whichever AI
app is the right one
in other words the app I would like to
control all the AIS is AI it's AI yeah I
mean you'd have to have ai as well
probably so get a give me a concierge
app that has an API connection to all
the other apps
and set be free
I feel as if Google will have to be that
I feel as if somebody's going to have to
consolidate the other apps because I
don't think they're just going to open
their apis do you think everybody's just
going to be able to use it yeah
concierge app that's what I need
well there's an update on threads the
meta Facebook competitor to Twitter
now of course they got lots of flashy
attention during the launch because you
could bring over your Instagram
follows and that would give you a big
head start but um
turns out that it's not doing so well
after the first week
now uh daily I saw this in a
tweet by Mario novel
that Delia active users dropped off
pretty hard
um 38 lower than the first week time
spent per user went from 20 minutes to
five
this is 75 reduction in four days
during the same period Twitter remained
virtually unchanged
at Instagram took a little bit of a hit
just a little bit
so
this is not looking so good
however if I could make uh just one
contextual point
we we expected or a lot of people
expected the threads would at least
start off with a big solid base and
maybe grow from there but if you think
about it
the design of their system guaranteed
that it would fall off right away
Am I Wrong by design it should have
fallen off the next week just like it
did and the reason is it never it never
started small and grew
it started big and then people looked at
it and some of them said yeah not for me
so if you start huge because you could
pour it over easily Port over your
Instagram people
that you're you're just asking for a
drop the next week
because the people they brought off were
not really solid users who were going to
stick around
they were just casual tourists so if you
bring over 100 million casual tourists
to your product well what should you
logically expect the next week is going
to look like
it's going to look like there were
casual tourists and they didn't need to
stick around
so I think the the threads trajectory so
far
is exactly what you should expect
now if it's going to succeed which seems
like a pretty big if at this point
what you would expect is that they would
have this big launch it would get a lot
of attention people would say there's
not my friends aren't here and then they
would go away
but
if threads is going to work it will have
you know by now created some base of
people
who want to be there
and if they want to stay there then you
know it could grow from there but it
pretty much had this the way they
launched largely guaranteed that it
would tank the next week would you agree
with that analysis that the tanking is
was baked into the way they designed it
there was no way around it
I mean I guess they can be optimistic
and say maybe all these people who used
Instagram will love our new thing that
always existed and they weren't using it
right if you were on Instagram and not
using Twitter
how much interest did you have in a
Twitter clone
if you weren't already satisfied with
all your you know your small message
tweeting needs
you probably never needed them in the
first place
and and I said this before I you know
brought over all of my Instagram
followers only to learn that ninety
percent of my the people I follow on
Instagram can't talk
they can't talk
imagine they can take a great picture
they can take a picture like nobody's
business but then they try to do a
thread or you know like a little message
and they use their language skills
it's not so good it's not so good
now mostly the Instagram people are
trying to not offend you
do you know what happens when they write
text that doesn't offend you
you don't want to read it
ha
right the world is full of text that
doesn't offend me why why would I be
attracted to it I need a little Edge
I need to be offended a little bit
somebody pointed out that uh Zuckerberg
is only posted once on threads in a week
it was a picture of a lake
Elon Musk you know toilet tweeting on
Twitter some of the The Funniest tweets
you've ever seen in your life or at the
very least they're provocative right and
then and the best soccer we could do is
one picture of a lake in a week
so that tells you how excited he is but
in his defense
uh Zuckerberg is probably spending all
of his time in the virtual reality world
no he's not doing that either do you
know why he's not spending all of his
time in the virtual reality world of
matter
same reason you're not
nobody wants to be there
just nobody wants to be there
I have I have zero interest
does anybody have interest in the
virtual world
here's how uninterested I am in the
virtual world
I hate to sleep
I don't even like to be asleep
because when I'm asleep I go to the
virtual world you know the dream world
that doesn't really count and when I
wake up
when I wake up a hundred percent of all
the stuff I did in my virtual world
is it worth piss
because it wasn't real
it was just a bunch of that
happened in my brain while I was trying
to rest
so that's what that's what the virtual
reality feels like it feels like leaving
the real world
for something that can never be
important and never can be real
I'm just not drawn to it at all I was I
have to admit there was a point where I
was drawn to it at least mentally well
actually enough to actually buy a buy a
system actually add a virtual reality
system uh until recently and
I thought it was a lot of fun
and then after I'd played a few things
that were fun and they gave me a
headache
and I realized that the entire time that
I was doing this thing I wasn't part of
the real world and then I said I don't
really like that I'd rather be in the
real world
you got stuff to do
so I don't think the virtual reality
thing isn't gonna work
honestly that's my current opinion I
would have said it would work a while
ago but it looks like it won't
now I could be wrong because there could
be some point where if you had AI into
the virtual world you can just go into
this world full of magical characters
who talk to you you might even have
friends you might have like a friend in
the virtual world who's an AI character
who just remembers you so I I can see a
certain number of shut-ins and people in
wheelchairs and stuff like that might
use it I love it I just don't think that
healthy
people who have full lives in the real
world you're going to want to spend too
much time in it now I would have said
that about gaming as well that would
have been totally wrong about that
however
um what percent of people are regular
Gamers do you think
of the General Public
what percent actually sit down and you
know on a regular basis they gave
you say 25 25 I if I had to guess I
think it's in the
10 to 15 percent
somewhere 10 15.
something like that yeah I think that's
the upside for virtual reality as well
somewhere in that category all right uh
however threads despite its traffic
has pulled off one of the greatest
successes
I know in modern modern technical world
and I'm impressed so what threads did
was it got Ron Perlman to leave Twitter
so that's one of the biggest
accomplishments of the year and I'm very
grateful to Zuckerberg for creating the
product
whose only purpose was to remove Ron
Perlman from Twitter and it did it very
well it did it very well
they'll probably be back
uh I saw a tweet from a user named drain
damage
who described threads after I noted that
Ron Perlman left to be on threads he
described threads as the Island of
Misfit tweeters
[Laughter]
threads as the Island of Misfit tweeters
what do you think of Ron Perlman don't
you just think of mental problems
yeah somebody told them that they're
holding the camera right up to his face
when he does
what he does his videos was a good idea
I think you're gonna hold it right up
here and then I'm gonna I'm gonna growl
with my ugly face wow
wow
yeah take that to threads will you
get get it get out of my face with that
go to the Island of Misfit tweeters
all right Wall Street journals says good
news paychecks uh and pay is right going
up higher than inflation
paychecks are being raised higher than
inflation
paychecks are going up higher than
inflation
what is it that causes inflation
well a number of things the amount of
money you print of course
but is it one of the things that causes
inflation
Rising wages
am I wrong about that aren't raising our
Rising wages
inflation
so the good news is that the inflation
isn't going up
just all the salaries of the people
and I don't see how that could be any
problem down the road
it's like none of the news is clean it's
all hey good news
yeah it's all like that it's really good
news
yeah nothing's a clean win anymore
well there was a an internet I saw there
was a a whiteness studies professor
who said that uh white people who treat
all Races equally are dangerous
I saw this on a tweet by amuse on
Twitter
um that's right whiteness studies
professor says white people who treat
all Races equally are dangerous
and here she is
I
I had to weigh in and say that I don't
judge people by race I don't think
that's right I judge them by their
haircuts their haircuts
I'm going to be a little bit harsh on
this white studies professor
um
haircut that's not on point
it's just not on point
in fact if you see
a professor with this haircut
I wouldn't take the class
I really wouldn't I'd like sign up for
almost anything else
I take I take statistics before I take
the class with a haircut and I'm just
saying
think about think about the whole
picture the big picture
well as you know I have announced
that I'm no longer going to care about
uh racial groups or any kind of group
don't care
so I'm going to see if I can make this
stick it would be my my greatest
achievement
so you know what I realized today you
know Dr Dr Kings
let's say his advice to society
was to judge people by the content of
their character
and not by their race
now that sounded pretty good didn't it
judge people by the content of their
character
well it turns out if you do that you
don't get a good outcome
so
turns out that didn't work at all it
didn't work at all now the reason we're
we're moving away from it and when I say
we I mean the political left the reason
they're moving away
from looking at the content to people's
character which would include their
achievement and you know what they've
done to prepare themselves for a good
life that just didn't work didn't work
at all so instead they had to use uh
other things like race and gender and
sexual preference and stuff like that
um
so we've got this situation where
we've completely abandoned the content
of the character as a
really is a variable which is not even a
variable anymore it's more about what
you look like
now how many of you are buying into that
system the system where we talk about
people by their category
see part of the problem is that we allow
ourselves to enter the frame
because if one side says hey we're going
to do this thing with racial preferences
or racial consideration
how do you talk about it without
entering the frame
see the problem
if somebody says I'm going to do this
thing it has a racial you know quality
to it you can't even have the
conversation
without first entering their frame that
you're on one side and there's somebody
on the other side
why must I do that I reject that now I
reject that I'm even going to be in that
conversation
so here's here's my new and I haven't
really modeled this yet so I don't know
if this can work yet I'm going to try it
from now on if the conversation is blah
blah blah something about race I just
take a pass
okay I'm not really in the world where I
judge people by their race
so this is a conversation for you to
have with yourself
if you'd like me to be involved in your
conversation I'd be happy to talk about
individuals if there are any individuals
who feel like they're being held back
I could give them some advice
how did it not be held back you know
develop your talent stack and stay out
of trouble you know easy stuff
so from now on it's just individuals
so 100 of all the stories and things
about a group is a group and this group
is bad and this group to this this group
I don't care
I've I just don't even care what group
you're in
I'm just not going to be part of that
conversation but I'm going to cover it
in the news just to show you all the
idiots who are
fair enough we're just going to mock
them for being race obsessed I'm not
going to say they're right or wrong
they're just silly no they're they're
just mockery they're fodder for mockery
and our enjoyment so let's use them that
way
uh well how much assault is are we
getting on the ESG and Dei there's an
opinion piece today in the Wall Street
Journal
about those two things and from Alicia
Finley
and let me read
two criticisms that I'm not sure you
would have seen a year ago
ask ask me if somebody would have said
this out loud in a major opinion piece
one year ago
uh so Alicia Finley writes for years
America's political class has lamented
that too many college grads are working
in low-paying jobs that don't require
post-secondary degrees the diversity
equity and inclusion environmental
social and governments Industries Dei
and ESG respectively are solving for
this problem
walk reading many others
all right so it's not that Dei and the
SG solve problems
they solve problems by creating other
ones now in this context the problem
solved is that somebody is getting a job
not serving food
which is a perfectly respectable job but
rather they also have kids get jobs now
in the Dei and ESG field so people who
might have been your waiter
are now running your company
right
because if you're the CEO and you don't
do what the Dei and the SG people tell
you you got to do
you know you're gonna have some trouble
so we took uh Baristas and servers from
restaurants
uh and turned them into TI the sgf
professionals so now that your waiter is
running your company
now I'm of course using hyperbole but
that is actually what this art what this
opinion piece is suggesting that that
you know there's some connection between
the service industry and ESG and d i i
don't buy that connection there's not so
many people in Dei and the SG that it's
taking you by then of the service
industry but it's a funny comparison
right so what is the SG and Di good for
for mocking
for mocking so this is perfect so it
doesn't matter there's real you know
that that comparison of servers to ESG
that's not like a real comparison but
it's fun mockery
and that's all it's good for that's the
only thing ESG and Di are good for just
are jokes because anybody who's doing it
at this point is simply just a racist
we don't have to we don't have to uh you
know
uh soften our words
if you're involved in any way in
promoting ESG and Di you're just a flat
out racist
and it doesn't matter what group you're
in again has nothing to do with what
group you're in as an individual
I would judge you to be a racist
and I would try to stay away from you if
I could no matter what race you are
because that's not the important part
the important part is if the content of
your character drove you to be in the
ESG or Dei professional
sorry about your character
sorry your character needs a little work
all right
um and as I said the reasoning is
because black people are successful all
over the place
I mean the question of can you be black
and successful
asked and answered yes
yes that's the end of the conversation
right
everything else is just an annoyance or
something to mock as long as everybody
has some some path that works for
everybody I mean basically everybody who
does the same stuff gets a good result
almost everybody
stay out of jail stay off drugs don't
get married until you you know you're a
little bit more established
get a job build some skills it's worked
for a hundred percent of people
so pretending it pretending that doesn't
work anymore is just I'm just not going
to pretend anymore I can't pretend that
doing all the right things doesn't work
and that that's what a lot of the Dei
and ESG stuff it asks you to pretend
that doing the obvious easy simple
direct clear things that have worked for
every person since the beginning of time
just don't work for one group
what could be more racist than that
this is that is the most racist thing
you could ever come up with you could
think all day long to try to come up
with something more racist but you
couldn't
that's like Peak
anyway
um
here's a good example of a change in the
subject a little bit here
uh word salad I'd like to give you
examples of where I trigger people into
word salad
because every time you see one it makes
it a little easier to identify the next
one now the word solid can pop up in a
variety of places but my my context is
that if somebody makes a point
in public
that you rip apart and show them to be
wrong
they don't usually change their mind say
well that's a good point sometimes they
do if it's a weekly held opinion but if
it's a strongly held opinion they tend
to double down and say
say words that don't no longer make
sense but they're sure they do
you want to see an example
so the Arctic there was a title and an
article that said that RFK Jr
um
this is the exact title RFK Jr suggested
covid is a Chinese bio weapon ethnically
targeted to attack Caucasians and black
people and to spare Ashkenazi Jews and
Chinese people all right so that was a
headline attacking RFK Jr and saying
that he suggested covet is a Chinese bio
weapon
I tweeted in response to that because
that was misleading I said instead of
saying that he suggested covet is a
Chinese bio weapon
how about suggested it might be
or suggested it looks like it could be
would you have any problem if he said
you know it looks like it could be
who would have a problem with that
because we know it came from a lab and
they weren't they weren't putting into
the lab just for fun
they weren't putting it in the lab to
make it safer no they were putting it in
the lab to make it a weapon and if you
had a choice of making a weapon that
would kill you know one ethnicity more
than another well that would be the
height of evil you know it's hard to
imagine more evil thing that you could
do but in the in the in the context of
War
yeah I can imagine it
I can imagine China coming up with a
virus if they could I'm not saying this
is it but if they could
you would imagine that would be a
variable they would care about right
because if it gets out there
well they're they're relatively
protected now I don't think that the uh
the covid
was necessarily demonstrated to Target
ethnicities
I believe that black Americans had a
tough time with covid but they also have
low vitamin D
to me the correlation that looks pretty
obvious is that wherever there was low
vitamin D there were there were problems
with coven
it just that correlation is pretty clear
but of course bad Health probably gives
you bad vitamin D so there's a causation
problem there but the correlation is
wrong
and
here's uh all right so getting back to
my word salad so the headline says that
RFK just suggested covet is I said it
would be better to say suggested it
might be
because everybody would agree with
suggested it might be
because all you have to do is prove that
it looks like it had disparate outcomes
but if you say suggested it is
then the way you hear it even though the
words are kind of similar in meaning the
way you hear it is he thinks it's true
that's really different
than suggests it might be
right so a Critic came into my comment
and said so this is before the words out
disingenuously suggesting a falsehood
talk about RFK
disingenuously suggesting a falsehood
for the malicious intent of misleading a
particular weak-minded segment of the
populace is indeed dangerous
so then I asked this are you opposed to
all forms of inquiry or only this one
now this is the trigger for the
cognitive dissonance
because my point is asking questions
isn't a problem
noticing correlations is not a problem
pointing out that there's a correlation
and you notice that is not a problem
asking if maybe we should dig into this
correlation that you noticed is not a
problem in fact it would be basic to the
scientific
process right somebody has a question
seems like a good question there's a
correlation look into it scientific
processing
so once I pointed out that asking
questions and looking at correlations
you know I said it cleverly are you
opposed to all forms of inquiry or only
this one listen to the next response
which I expect it to be word solid now
you tell me if this sounds like word
salad to you okay
no inquiry is the first step in the
scientific method okay so far so good
we're on the same page
I'm opposed to suggesting malicious
intent over inflammatory rhetoric
designed to Galvanize smooth brain
distrust as a tool that's far more
effective than unproven genetic
targeting espoused by this
pseudo-intellectual
what
what
I don't understand any of those words I
mean I know what the words mean but when
they're put together do they make any
sense now of course he defended it and
said I'm dumb because anybody would
understand what he said
but uh do you see this as a word solid
how many would agree
that that was a a cognitive dissonance
trigger
that clearly created word salad
you can see it right you know once you
see a number of examples it's just
really obvious you can pick them out
so I saw Brian romelli who I always
talked about and tweet about who's an
expert on AI and other technology stuff
he's just real smart guy
and he was saying the other day that
something I've been saying which is
that the big aha from AI will not be how
cool the AI is and what it does for us
that's just cool but the big AI the big
aha
will be learning what human beings
always were
and this word solid suggestion this word
solid example this is it
this is what AI is telling you too
AI is telling you that your intelligence
your so-called intelligence is just
pattern recognition
that's all it is it's just doing the
thing that seems like the next thing
that should happen
and we think we're smart
we're not
we're just the AI we're just a pattern
recognition and so this cognitive
dissonance thing what it does is it
breaks up your pattern recognition
processor in your brain so once your
pattern recognition processor gets
turned off or broken which is what I do
with the the triggers
once it's broken something is still
going to come out but it won't conform
to pattern anymore because you broke the
pattern
so what comes out doesn't sound like it
makes sense because your brain is
looking for a pattern but I broke the
pattern generator in another brain so it
temporarily is spouting things that
don't conform to a pattern you don't
even recognize it you can't even tell
what they're saying because the pattern
is broken
that's a word solid is just pattern
break breaking the pattern because the
words individually make sense you can
even argue that the sentence makes sense
but somehow together none of it makes
sense no pattern
all right um
Canadian wildfires are now
affecting Montana to Ohio
so we're being attacked by poison from
the south in the form of Fentanyl and
now poison for the North in the form of
smoke
you know who feels a little bit safer
Crimea
yeah
Crimea
Crimea River
all right we'll talk about cry beer
I don't have much to say about this but
why is Canada becoming our big problem
lately we've been we've had more we've
had more problems with Canada
than we have with you know Taiwan
all right
um there's a new movie coming out which
believe it or not is going to change or
reality
do you think do you think that's a big
claim there's a new movie I'll tell you
which one it is in a moment it's going
to change reality
all right it's a movie called The
Creator
and I don't know much about it except
just I watched the trailer
apparently it's a new movie and it's uh
it's a high-tech futuristic thing in
which AI
AI has taken over the world like the
Terminator and the spunky humans are
trying to fight it Against the Machines
now
I've told you before that when a big
movie comes out and it gets into your
consciousness
it makes everybody just see that pattern
the pattern that was in the movie
whether it was The Matrix or Soylent
Green or The Terminator
the the public in general being mostly
NPCs they use movies
to understand reality
so how many times have you been in this
conversation blah blah blah Oh you mean
like The Matrix
you turn on Andrew Tate interview blah
blah blah The Matrix is trying to get me
you talk about the AI danger blah blah
blah you mean like Terminator oh it's
like Skynet right so we understand the
world through our movies
if you make a new movie that's a
blockbuster it looks like it's a big
budget I mean let me say for sure
I hate movies
I'll watch this one because I tend to
watch all the Sci-Fi stuff because when
I watch Sci-Fi
they there's one thing that they do well
sci-fi their violence is usually not
that graphic
I don't mind seeing a spaceship blow up
like I don't want to see somebody tied
to a chair in torture that's like
regular movies but like somebody hit
somebody with a phaser they just go oh
and there's like a little burn mark here
and they seem to be dead a nice clean
violence the the worst thing you need to
do is put people at the airlock and then
and then all of the silence just looks
like this the floating guy
as as they slowly turned into ice
it's not that bad
but also sci-fi has such complicated
plots that I never understand the plot
do you have that problem it doesn't
matter if it's Star Trek I I don't even
listened to the plot I just like the
atmospherics
I like I like putting on headphones and
just feeling them in the ship
that's why I like them so I'll watch it
but I worry that this movie and I don't
yet know if it's got like a overall
theme other than battling the machines
but if enough people see it this movie
will become the new operating system for
how the ordinary public understands Ai
and AI risks so the the risk of AI one
of the biggest questions in human
civilization
will largely be determined
by a movie
probably
the way the way we treat maybe the
biggest risk
ever to human civilization mostly
determined by how the movie was written
that's that's the way this is going to
go unfortunately it's a really big risk
right I mean I wouldn't ban the movie or
anything but the risk to civilization is
Extreme I haven't seen the movie so it
could be there's nothing in there that's
a risk but if it gives us a bad idea
about what we should or should not do
with AI it would change civilization
itself
that's a hell of a thing
all right um
I saw Jonathan Turley writing in the
hill that the colleges and universities
uh have vowed to make sure that they
stay racist
isn't that a weird thing to vow
because the affirmative action ruling by
the Supreme Court
told them they can't use you know race
directly you know as a main variable in
admissions but apparently there are lots
of workarounds that they can do to
massage the system so they end up with
the same outcome
but without running afoul of the law
and to me it's just amazing
that there that there are people who are
fighting hard to maintain discrimination
in 2020.
how how proud would you be if you fall
hard to maintain discrimination against
race
that's what they're doing they're like
working hard
they're having meetings and discussions
how can we stay as racist as possible
yeah no
all right so that's terrible for black
Americans of course because
um I was saying that black Americans got
promoted
is like the best Freedom you could ever
have which is to be free to you know
live your life without people imagining
that somebody gave you what you earned
that's a pretty big deal
you don't want people to think that you
didn't work for or you didn't deserve or
earn what you achieved
but it looks like colleges and
universities want to keep us guessing as
to whether black Americans achieved what
they achieved on Merit or some other
weird system that the colleges wanted to
implement
let me say again that I don't care about
black people
I care about black individuals
that'll get taken into context watch
this now I love black individuals like I
like every individual
you know irrespective of race but stop
making me care about black people as a
group because I also don't care about
white people as a group
I don't care about women as a group
Medicine Group gays as a group I don't
care about them as groups anymore
because you know the scientists maybe
should study that and if they learn
anything they can tell us but if you and
I are worried about group equality we're
just working on the wrong stuff you and
I should be working on individual
you know individual one-to-one hey
you're okay am I okay with you okay
we're good
you get that right and everything works
as soon as you let the grifters and the
you know the the people who make money
on this stuff as soon as they let you
imagine that you have a conversation
about a group
just excuse yourself
excuse yourself
say you know I'll talk all day about how
to handle individuals and how to make an
individual succeed despite whatever
whatever obstacles there are
but don't tell me that I have to treat a
group like it's an entity
there's no such thing as a group the
group The whole idea of a group is like
this mental construct
you know the group never comes into your
room
the the what happens to the group all
just isn't real irrelevant anymore now
this is a newer
a newer opinion of mine
and I would agree that there were so
there were times in history and not very
long ago where looking at the group
discrimination made perfect sense it
made perfect sense because things were
so bad
but at some point
and that point has to be long before
everything's equal everywhere way before
that if you could ever get to that point
you need to stop direct discrimination
and just work on individual success and
that's where we are so the big shift
should be that everybody is talking
about groups they're in the wrong
conversation
they're not right they're not wrong
they're just not a useful conversation
it's not anything you should be
concerned about or put any time or
effort into you should put no time or
effort into making
a group no matter who they are
better off
but you should certainly put attention
into making yourself better off and
anybody who asks for help any individual
so you should treat people like kings
and queens
and she treat groups like that's just
groups are
people
are awesome
that's the bottom line groups are
 people are awesome
so live your life that way I recommend
Rasmussen had a poll talked about this
affirmative action and the Supreme
Court's striking down of affirmative
action was popular with two-thirds of
the public
two-thirds of the public was against
discriminating by race
what
only two-thirds
only two-thirds were against
racial discrimination
I would hope that would be higher
but let me ask the question in a
different way
and we'll just see how smart you are and
I I think I think you'll probably get it
within three three points you're so
smart
but what present according to Rasmussen
disapprove of the Supreme Court's
decision and therefore are in favor of
continued discrimination by race
28 28 percent
excellent guessing you are all very
close the smartest audience in all of
politics
impressive
um Kamala Harris as you know is sort of
taking the lead on AI for the government
and uh last week she convened a group of
civil rights and
labor users
labor leaders to discuss the field of
artificial intelligence this Bloomberg
is reporting that
yeah so the person that we put in charge
of AI
decided that a good Strong place to
start the you know the protection of of
humanity was by convening a group of
civil rights and labor leaders
do you know who I don't care about
civil rights and labor leaders
here's AI here's AI here's a civil
rights and labor leaders
over here like way over here
is she the most incompetent vice
president we've ever had I mean Dan
quell was kind of impressive
I think she's out quailed quail and that
and that was pretty hard
all right just just to keep it you know
not
democrat or republican Dan Quayle was
not you remember what do you remember
what the problem was with Dan quell or
why there was a Dan quell
yeah here's the problem and I always say
this but it's funny every time I say it
so I'm going to say it again
the main requirement of a vice president
is to look less capable than the
president that's like the main thing
just stay out of trouble and look
clearly less capable than the president
she had Ronald Reagan excellent
president and he had George Bush who was
clearly not as you know not that didn't
have the same wattage as Reagan
but then but then the second in command
bush
becomes president largely because Reagan
was so popular really it was just an
extension of Reagan
now now bush has to find somebody who's
clearly less capable than he is
so now we're down two levels from Reagan
right
so I mean George was senior was a solid
president in my opinion he was pretty
solid
and but he had to find somebody who was
clearly not as solid as him and went all
the way to Dan Clem now if somehow Dan
Quayle had become president
who would Dan quella pick for his vice
president
I can only think of one thing
young Kamala Harris
thank you
young Tom Laris he was probably 10 years
old or something
yeah that was the only person who would
be less capable than Dan Quayle
all right I make fun of Dan quell but I
don't really know anything about him so
he's probably awesome in his own way
all right
and then uh I saw a compilation clip of
how many times Kamala Harris uses I
guess this is a Jesse Jackson quote
uh where she goes and we will get this
done
by looking at what can be
unburdened by what has been
and apparently she said this just dozens
and dozens of times she'll put it in
every speech because it's the only thing
she says that sounds smart
everything else doesn't sound smart but
when she says
what can be unburdened by what has been
unburdened by what has been
well
there's yet another video of her looking
inebriated in public
we're still not talking about it right
like we can only say this on weird
little podcasts
but you but you can't go on the regular
news and say well our drunken vice
president
embarrassed us again
see you can't just say the obvious that
she's clearly on something right you
have to ignore that for now so we're all
we're going to pretend that's not
happening right
we're going to pretend that Biden's
brain is just working perfectly and his
VP is totally sober
yeah let's let's pretend that's all true
she's entertaining anyway
all right uh Joe manchin is making some
trouble by I guess he's having an event
of these quote No Labels group it's a
potential third party group so he must
be flirting with a third party run
which everybody believes would do
nothing but
um
make Trump the president am I right
is that the way it would go if Joe
manchin ran as a third party you would
make Trump president pretty much for
sure assuming he gets the nomination
um
so why would he do that
I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out
his play now it makes sense total makes
sense that because he's a swinging foes
sometimes that he uses his power to get
legislation you know massage for his
benefit so that makes sense because he
uses his Swing Vote power but what what
new power would he gain
by being a third-party candidate
I feel like unless he believes he can't
win his seat back does he think he's not
going to win his seat back because
there's some talk about that right
so the real problem is he doesn't think
he'll get reelected to his current
position right so he might need an
escape path
because that would make sense because
that would give him something that's not
just losing you know you'd be able to go
to something
but
I I can't see him thinking that the
country would be better off
as he sees it because it basically he
would just determine who wins the
election
which is kind of cool I love the fact
that Joe manchin is smart enough that he
puts himself in these situations where
he's the most powerful person it's
totally free money he just keeps picking
it up
so maybe maybe uh
I'll just put this out there
imagine Joe manchin got really really
close to launching a third party
and then there were a bunch of
billionaires who were Democrats who know
that if that happens all the money that
they've donated to Biden will be wasted
total waste of money because he Mansion
would determine the outcome just by
running
so the billionaires on the left would
find out they were wasting all their
money how much money would they be
willing to give Joe manchin or promise
to give him at some time in the future
to talk about it being a third party
candidate
a billion dollars
a hundred million
you don't think it would make sense for
the the big billionaires on the left to
bribe him out of that job
maybe not in a way that you and I can
tell as a bribe but maybe down the road
he's running a company that got funded
by some big Democrat donor and you know
there's there's no nobody ever finds
there was any documentation connecting
them it's just the donor thought you
know hey this Joe manchin guy he could
run a business I I think I'll put some
money behind it
you're 75 years old so I guess he's not
going to run a business
but anyway I'm just trying to figure out
how does Joe manchin win
by even flirting with a third party it's
got to be that he's playing for the uh
being paid not to do it what do you
think
follow the money suggests that he cannot
make money by running for as a third
party
so if you follow the money you'd have to
say he's playing
to get bought out
that's what it looks like looks like
he's playing to be born out
we'll see
The Babylon bee of course the most
important media organization in the
world as a headline says scientists
warned that within six months Humanity
will run out of things to call racist
well what are we going to do then
what will we do then
Justin Trudeau as blaming America right
America's right wing
for the fact that Muslims in Canada are
opposed to lgbtq curriculums and schools
he's he's blaming right-wing Americans
for Canadian Muslims
because
Trudeau Trudeau managed to find the
topic the so outrageously stupid
that he made he made the Muslims in
Canada and the right wing in America
joined hands and sing Kumbaya and say
all right we're on the same team here we
are on the same team come on over here
Ahmad Ahmad Ahmad come over here we're
on the same team
just for now yeah maybe later we'll
disagree but for now
you and I same team
and uh Trudeau is on the other team but
I love the fact that Elon Musk weighed
in on a tweet about Trudeau this story
it was just a clown emoji
the richest man in the world owner of
Twitter and Tesla and SpaceX he responds
to the leader of Canada with a cloud
emoji and by the way there's nothing
else you could say
to to imagine that you could have some
logical conversation on this point
there's no logical conversation at that
point this is just true though being a
racist
it's just Trudeau being a racist
so you don't enter their frame do not
enter the frame do what must it
call it out as clown world
walk away they just don't answer the
frame
all right
um how many of you would agree with the
statement that Vivek ramaswamy seems to
be rising
uh and and like something's happening
you see it right
uh so the TP USC a event big
conservative event of young people uh
Vivek came in second in the straw poll
um beating out DeSantis now I guess this
event is hugely pro-trump so Trump got
almost all the votes but what was left
um notably DeSantis wasn't second
so
and I think I I saw a kanikoa the grade
he ran a poll on Twitter and also if a
fake did well in that
so uh and also if a vehicle is trending
on on Twitter
did you see which candidates are
trending today nobody else all right our
RFK Junior often Trends but lately it's
because
people are going after him for imagining
he's anti-Semitic the dumbest thing
imagine the RFK Jr is anti-Semitic that
might be the dumbest
assumptions like you don't even have to
look into it
you don't have to do any research to
find out that's obviously not true you
don't have to read the story yeah that
well that was just so obviously not true
don't even bother looking into it
there's nothing to see
um
but I think a lot of people are coming
around to the thought
that Trump plus Vivek
if the fake doesn't win it outright
which is still possible because anything
can happen with Trump right the the most
predictable thing about Trump is that
he's unpredictable
so who knows you know who knows maybe
the legal system takes them out maybe he
says something that's just too far this
time so it makes sense for Vivek to be
you know rising and also popular with
Trump trump actually said he's doing a
great job and he's competing with him
that's pretty amazing so it does seem
that there are at least
considering what might happen if Trump
got the nomination I think they're
thinking about it
and in my opinion and I heard this from
somebody else so I'm stealing this idea
the fake would be the perfect Co to
Trump's CEO
wouldn't it be great to have somebody
who is just a great operator
who who would just be the same logical
knows how to look at risk and reward
knows how to implement knows how to
execute and then you
then you season the vague
for the presidency later
so I've only I've only had a million
users on Twitter now for one day but as
I told you I'd be running things once I
got to a million because power is really
influence at times uh platform
let me say that again the amount of
power or influence anybody has is how
much skill they have in influence
multiplied times how many people see it
you know the size of your platform or
your audience
so with a million people
who are connected to you know millions
of other people
in theory my my training in Persuasion
times a million people should allow me
to run the world now
you know from behind the scenes nobody
leaving now but I've only been in charge
in one day and already it looks like you
can see the next 12 years pretty clearly
um it looks like Trump's going to get
the nomination Vivek will be a vice
president and then Vivek will take over
after having a tremendous run for a
president for eight years after that and
so I don't know if you saw this but it
was like looking into this
cloudy foggy Forest
and as soon as Trump said that maybe
DeSantis wouldn't be the second place
maybe of the fake he's doing a great job
as soon as Trump said that you could
feel the fog just went away
and the tree is just like
opened up and you can see 12 years ahead
did anybody else have that experience
where the moment you heard Trump say
something positive about Vivek you could
see 12 years ahead
felt like I've only had this feeling
once
2015.
that was the only time I thought oh my
God I'm not predicting the future I'm
actually looking at it
so when I made my famous call the Trump
would win in 2016.
internally it did not feel like a
prediction and I've never had that
experience before
it felt like I was looking at it
and that just happened again I did not
have that experience in the last
election in the last election I was
making sort of a pundit prediction based
on the facts you know as best I could
and was wrong was wrong but I swear as
soon as Trump
gave Vivek that little bit of positive
words
12 years you could see it you can see
all 12 years
well you say but unless the elections
are rigged
maybe and of course
this all depends on Trump
not getting himself in any new trouble
and that the trouble that's already
coming at him doesn't take him out so
those are big gifts those are really big
gifts but I'll tell you it doesn't feel
like a prediction anymore it feels like
I can see it
that's only happened once before so
we'll see if it means anything
all right I thought this was funny uh
there was a woman who tweeted name is
Chandler Remington Chandler Chandler
Remington which is one of the all-time
best names
Chandler Remington oh my come on
yeah you're gonna you're gonna be
something with that name right
like you never hear the homeless shelter
who's in the homeless shelter well
Chandler Remington just came in no no
Chandler was gonna you know do something
anyway she went to a what she calls a
feminist therapist and says the feminist
therapist did the following described a
man I had been in a relationship with as
predatory when all of our interactions
had been consensual
two blamed the patriarchy for problems
in my life which stemmed completely from
women
and three made General negative
statements about men portraying them as
Liars or deceptive for no good reason
So based on all of the above I'm
starting therapy with a new male
therapist on Monday wish me luck
yeah I would I would never go to a
marriage therapist if I were you
certainly wouldn't go to a female
marriage therapist for the same reason
basically this was my same experience I
had the same experience now the examples
I didn't have so these are different
examples but my experience was
oh my God this is somebody who likes
women and hates men
like right off the bat
I thought I got a man-hater and it went
that way
they really went that way now that's my
subjective opinion right subjectively
but I was told that I couldn't come I
couldn't have um
I couldn't have an objection
to how my mate acted but she could have
objections to how I acted
that and that was the rule and if you
tried to break that rule then everything
stopped
only one person could have objections
with the other that was actually the
rule
because if I had objections I was trying
to change her
but if she had objections it was because
I was being an
that was like actually my experience
and how would that possibly work how in
what world could that work to like make
you
uh anyway so I agreed with it
um Elon Musk also weighed in on that he
said friends are far better than therapy
the incentive structure is to keep you
hooked and never cured that's basically
the whole problem right there
therapists don't want to fix you because
I often thought even when I went to
therapy I thought
this could get fixed in like two
sentences
right this could get fixed in two
sentences you just find the problem and
tell us what to do differently and we'll
go do that I'll bet we'll be fine
could not find could not find the
problem just kept looking
except the problem something about me I
guess
yeah it's uh follow the money here
you're not going to get any cures from
people who are charged by the hour
he said be especially wary of therapists
in expensive neighborhoods their true
loyalty is to their landlord not you
that's so brutal their loyalty is their
landlord
completely true
all right
there's a report that Tucker Carlson's
gonna you've already heard might do his
uh show on Twitter exclusively I guess
but he's reportedly also got a big
sponsor for that called Public Square
and they're a conservative friendly
shopping app so they're a shopping app
that shows you products from non-esg
companies
I think I'm going to use this
good enough
you had me at uh
you had me at non-esg shopping apps now
um I don't think necessarily this one
app is going to make a difference but
it's more to the point that ESG is now a
dead man walking I mean it's just
embarrassing if you're still in favor of
it at this point
um China's economy is not bouncing back
after the
uh lockdown
and people are wondering why why why are
they not bouncing back why is the
economy lagging well it's because they
pissed me off obviously there might be
other reasons but that's the main one
all right the in Ukraine there was a
main bridge I guess to Crimea the main
bridge that Russia
used to supply Crimea
and apparently there was a submarine
drone attack so a submarine that was
operated remotely there were two of them
and they went in there and
did some stuff and blew up part of the
bridge but it didn't break out it didn't
blow up the the railroad part of the
bridge
so the bridge had a car part and a
railroad part and it blew up the car
part that didn't make much difference
and it left the rail part intact
and here's my question
how in the world are railroads still
operating anywhere near a war zone
a railroad
how in the world
can you not take out railroads
I would think that would be the single
easiest thing you could do I can't even
imagine anything easier than taking out
a railroad because railroads would have
massive Links of track
that nobody's watching
can't one person take out a railroad
just you know just ruin the tracks a
little bit in one area
I I don't every once in a while I just
don't understand I also don't understand
why Islamic Terror attacks have largely
stopped in the United States
that was not even possible
unless unless they have so much unless
our government has so much control over
our Communications that just nobody can
put together a scheme
but how in the world are there still
railroads in Ukraine or any part of
Russia that's close to Ukraine I don't
understand it
anyway all those bombs that nobody could
take out a railroad that the the main
thing that delivers ammunition
so the primary thing that delivers
ammunition and they're still operating
what's going on
all right
um
I think that's all I got
that's all I needed because it was the
best live stream you've ever seen today
and maybe tomorrow will be even better
so
let's go continue being awesome and uh I
think everything's starting to
look good
maybe the Golden Age
too soon
yeah Andrew Tate's getting some heavy
pushback on social media if you haven't
seen it
so
um if you're watching that story I'd
recommend
watching both sides
should hear what Andrew Tate says but
you should hear what is this detractors
say because what his detractors say is
primarily
video and audio of Andrew Tate in his
own voice
so you want to hear him saying he's
going to do exactly the lover boy thing
and he's been doing a lot of it
and then you know defending that he's
doing it saying that he didn't do it so
he's on he's on video saying that he was
doing it massively and also that uh all
it is is that he was being nice to women
and they like to work
webcams
so you just you decide you be the
decision maker
yeah I don't know if I don't know if
what he did was illegal anywhere except
for Romania
so Romania has a specific law where the
Romanians can tell you that the women
were victims even if the women say they
were not so that's a weird law
so if I had to bet I'm going to bet he
gets out of his legal troubles
unless is rigged and it might be I mean
there's a good 50 chance of that I would
think
but I think he would be able to persuade
his way out just because he's a good
Persuader
regardless of whether the law was
technically broken or not I think he's
going to get out of it now does Romania
have the Romania have the equivalent of
a Supreme Court
who can tell me do they have the
equivalent of an appeals court
because if they do that's probably where
it ends up
I don't imagine the regular Court would
necessarily make the right decision but
if there's some kind of appeals I think
I would like his chances and it Appeals
do you have rental property I do not
don't own any rental property
I own my house I have one house
One Automobile
um
and a lot of index funds that's about it
that's pretty much my entire situation
all right that's all we need and uh two
electric bikes I do have two electric
bikes so I splurged the first one wasn't
good I bought my first one during the
height of the pandemic
and the pandemic just you know all the
bikes were purchased so I couldn't get
what I wanted like I couldn't get one
that looked cool which is half of owning
an e-bike as they look cool I had to get
one that looked really
kind of conservative and boring so
immediately as soon as the supply went
up I I got one that looks cool anyway so
that's uh that's it for Me by YouTube
thanks for
