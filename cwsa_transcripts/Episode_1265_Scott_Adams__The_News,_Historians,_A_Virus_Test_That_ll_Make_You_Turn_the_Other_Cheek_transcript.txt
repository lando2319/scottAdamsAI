[Music]
hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
yeah it's time for coffee with scott
adams best time of the day
every single time now i have to warn you
that i'm gonna miss
uh one morning i believe it's
tomorrow morning no it's uh thursday
morning and
uh hey omar good morning good morning
get in here we got lots to talk about
but before we do
what do we do before we talk about all
the fun things
ah it's a simultaneous step that's right
and all you need
is uh um let's see
all you need is i'm not cheating i'm not
looking at my cheat sheet
i'm not looking to the left all you need
is a cover of my
glasses tanker cello's just dying the
canteen checkered classic vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine heat of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous up it
happens now
go
i'm being reminded that tomorrow is
thursday
let me tell you i have completely lost
all the track of time i have this weird
condition
uh in which calendars confuse me
lots of things confuse me but i'm not
good with calendars
i'll tell you more about that some other
time so
one of the things that i'm in bora bora
now in french polynesia if you didn't
know
and one of the remarkable things about
this place is the low crime
and i figured out why finally why is
there such low crime here
there could never really be any kind of
a underground
mafia here because the water is so clear
if you took a body and you you put them
in the bottom of the lagoon
people would be walking by the lagoon
and they'd say hey
there's mark oh oh
because you would see them so clearly
it's like they're not even underwater
so it'd be hard to put dispose of your
bodies out here
that's my take on why the crime is so
low
all right so it turns out that biden is
describing
his vice president kabul harris as quote
she's going to be the final opinion he
listens to before making his big
decisions
so not only will
kamala harris not have a portfolio which
is what you do with vice presidents when
you want to keep them as vice presidents
but she's going to be the last person he
talks to before he makes a big decision
which is a lot like she's making the
decision isn't it
now he didn't say i'm going to talk to
her last
and then i'm going to ignore her advice
i feel as if he's he's just moving us a
little bit closer
every day to her taking over but he
doesn't want to say it directly
this this is sort of a version of the
cats on the roof
well let me let me break it to you
slowly
i'm not going to say she's the real
president
i'm just going to say she doesn't have a
portfolio she's working on
i'm not going to say she's the real
president i'm just saying
i'm a certain age i don't think i'd run
for a second
term i'm not saying that she's the real
president
i'm just saying she's the last person
i'll talk to
before i make a big decision which is
totally different
do you see it every little move is just
a little bit more in that direction
so that's fun to watch them manage us uh
with the propaganda um
so an interesting thing happened at the
end of biden's
remarks i guess at a press conference in
which fox news's peter ducey
asked him uh what he talked about when
he talked to
putin so i guess biden and putin must
have a phone call
and biden's answer was his answer to the
question what did you talk with putin
about
biden said you ha-ha-ha-ha
so he just joked at peter ducey and then
you know left the room now that's the
second time
he's used the same joke on peter ducey
so i forget the context of the other one
what but i think when he was riding his
bicycle biden was and
peter ducey asked him a question and he
and biden looked at him and said you
so he's basically used the same joke
twice which isn't much of a joke
but here's what i think you ought to
look for it could be
that he's just treating peter ducey like
a
somebody from fox news so he's doing the
same thing that
trump did to cnn so it might be nothing
but you know the way he's treating
fox news which would be
um not unexpected but
i'd also look for the fact he might be
covering some memory problems
so look for this pattern going forward
look for re for situations in which
biden
asked to recall something from memory
makes a joke instead as a cover-up for a
baby not having so much memory
because if if biden is asked what his
policy is
then that's probably something he's
practiced a lot what do you think of
the paris accord and then he'll say blah
blah blah we have to lead the world
blah blah trump is bad but when you ask
him a memory problem
of do you you know what did you do then
he hasn't practiced that
because why would you you wouldn't think
to practice your memories
you would think to practice something
like a policy decision you know
something to describe so
look for him to have to cover any memory
related questions by making a joke
we'll see if that happens so it's a
semi-prediction
slash pattern to look for
you probably saw the humorous video
going around
of jen pasaki biden's spokesperson
who apparently has used the phrase i'll
have to circle back
a lot of times already she hasn't been
on the job long
but a lot of a lot of circling back so
when you see all the times that
she says that it it puts the lie to the
statement that they were going to be the
honest
and as cnn says refreshing
refreshing uh communicator
there's gonna be a lot of stuff she's
gotta circle back on if you know what i
mean
so my favorite uh cnn demon
uh propagandist you know i realized
today that
calling people opinion people versus
news people
isn't really enough detail right
i don't think anymore you could call
everybody who works at cnn
an opinion person or a news person
there's another category
which is propagandist and
i don't think you can call the opinion
people opinion people
when they go so far into propaganda that
it's
it's just ridiculous right now of course
you can make the same argument
about some people on the right so i'm
not saying this is
you know limited to one side but my
favorite propagandist
is cnn's john avlon and i don't know
what makes me
so entertained by him i think it's
because he's smiling when he's being
evil
and the the combination of the smile and
the evil
makes it look different than if you were
just being evil or just smiling
you know those two things shouldn't be
paired that's demon territory
so he was mocking uh in an opinion piece
of video
he was john avalon was mocking rand paul
for saying that biden's speech
calling for unity was actually thinly
veiled
suggestion that republicans are white
supremacists
so so ron paul i'm sorry rand paul
says that you know biden is essentially
suggesting that republicans are really
white supremacist
how does john avalon the propagandist
treat that
he he says huh why is rand paul worried
about this
you see that huh why is rand paul
worried about
being called the white supremacist he's
literally suggesting that
rand paul is a white supremacist so in
his propaganda piece
in which he's mocking rand paul for
thinking that
biden is somehow suggesting he's a white
supremacist
john athlon clearly suggests clearly
i mean there's no ambiguity there
that rand paul is a white supremacist
right on tv
no no evidence no accu
no reason for it he just puts him in the
same category as
a white supremacist you don't need
reasons apparently
but it gets better uh rand i'm sorry
john avalon and i've seen other people
at cnn
and in other places use this phrase the
big lie
do you know what they refer to as the
big lie
well it turns out they've branded the
idea that
trump's claimed that the and other
people's claim that the election
was rigged so they're calling that the
big lie
what does the big lie remind you of
is there some thinly veiled
suggestion when you use
a phrase like the big lie where did that
come from
yeah it's a nazi phrase
the big lie correct me if i'm wrong
refers to
the nazi propaganda
process yeah i think it was uh gobbles
gobbles i never know how to pronounce
his name goebbels
um he was one who said that a big lie is
easier to sell than
a small one so the the phrase big lie
is associated with nazis so again
john avalon clearly
branding republicans and trump
as a nazi and he's doing it right on
television like that's an opinion
now an opinion with some you know detail
behind it might be one thing
but this is pure propaganda it is nazi
propaganda
just like it in which he's branding a
class of people
a class of people who should be
let's say treated differently by society
and not well
and that's that's what he would like you
to think of
republicans quite amazing
quite amazing to watch uh actual
nazi-like propaganda that's being sold
as
ordinary opinion it's just an opinion
that these people should be treated as
second-class citizens
so here's some other
shocking things there's tom cotton's
writing an opinion piece
saying we should remove these seven 7000
remaining
national guard that apparently we're
going to remain in the capital
to which i said am i missing something
in this story
is there some reason we need a standing
defensive army in washington dc
i understand the capital was assaulted i
understand there's probably more chatter
on the internet
but really right now we need 7 000
people
guarding the capital we don't have
enough
police to take care of whatever you know
might happen
because you get a lot of warning if a
lot of people are going to show up don't
you
i feel as though i feel as though that
whole uh
what was it stop the steel movement that
became the
at least some members of them uh or at
least some people who attended
the larger event you know i got into the
capitol building and nobody's
in favor of that or at least i'm not
you can you can judge it yourself but i
hope you're not in favor of that either
so why do we have troops
i think i've got to agree with tom
cotton here it's time to get rid of the
troops and thank them thank them for
their work
and not put them in parking garages
i forget if i told you this yesterday in
some publication called the college fix
it reports that researchers plan to
revise a study on youtube echo chambers
that labeled the dilbert cartoonist as
far right
i still laugh at that i'm about as uh
we live in a world in which people can't
even conceive
that you might be able to criticize both
sides for different things
it's like it's not even a thing that you
would imagine
that maybe just because i am in favor of
some things or opposed to some things
that
that you could just label me as far
right i label myself as left of bernie
so there you go there's a story about a
literary agent
who was fired by the the agency
that employed him and here's here's the
reason he was fired
because he has an account on gab and
parlor
that's it he got fired for that he got
fired
for using social media companies
that lots of people use but more people
associated with the right
use them and so just the fact that he
was using
those two platforms independent of
whatever he was doing on there
that's it he got fired for it and he got
fired because somebody called them
called the downs somebody you know on
social media said hey do you know that
one of your employees or agents
one of your agents has these social
media accounts
and he actually got fired
wow now i hope what happens
is that anybody who does that sort of
thing the firing i mean
ends up taking a hit now of course it's
a public story
and who would do business if you were on
the right
who would do business with us with this
person who just fired somebody for
having a
social media account she doesn't like
who would do business with them
if you were a republican i i wouldn't
i mean that would be that would be a
hard no right
it wouldn't it wouldn't matter as long
as there's some competition
why in the world would you deal with
somebody like that
there's an interesting story that china
has developed some kind of an
um this is not a joke by the way what
follows
is not a joke china has developed an
anal coronavirus test
now i don't know the details of it
because i didn't want to delve into it
if you know what i mean
but it is sort of a turn the other cheek
situation as opposed to the
cheek swabs that you were doing in your
mouth apparently your other cheeks will
get involved now
and i'm just putting that out there that
there's an anal coronavirus test
well i'll use that as a segue for some
other stories about
things that china is trying to shove up
your ass
so the coronavirus test is the first
thing that china is trying to
shove up your asses the second thing is
a story about the world health
organization
top officials said that in a recent
press conference that
is quote definitely too early to
conclude that the
coronavirus originated in china
okay it's way too early people do not
assume that the coronavirus originated
in china
but there's a trick to this one that's
sort of the headline
so what i told you was the headline when
you hear that the world health
organization is saying
we're not sure where this started you
know be open-minded about it
it doesn't sound good does it but then
the rest of the story kind of clarifies
which is that the world health
organization is backing some scientists
who are going to study the origins of
the the virus
so in the context of your organization
backing a study about the origin of the
virus
should you say in advance what the
origin of the virus is
no no you should act as though you're
open-minded even if you're not
so under this specific situation the
world health organization
executive is perfectly correct
in saying let's be open-minded and see
where the data goes
if he had been speaking as just a
citizen he probably would have said the
same thing that you would say which is
i'm pretty sure it's china pretty sure
it's china
but because he's associated with a some
research that just began
into looking about the origin then he
should say
let's be open-minded otherwise what's
the point you know why are they doing
the
the study if he already knows the answer
so i think that was the right political
answer
who knows what he really believes
here's an interesting question so i
guess the olympics coming up will be in
china
but the united states or at least
pompeo designated china um
would they say that they're committing a
genocide in
xinjiang no yes
yeah so the idea is that if the united
states has
labeled china as committing genocide
against the uyghurs
somebody says japan
that's not right is it
um why is there a major story
why is there a major story about the
olympics in china
if all of you think the olympics are in
japan
what's happening right now so i guess
it's the difference between the
2022 winter games versus
the whatever japan is doing
summer olympics are in japan the next
winter olympics i'm just reading the
comments now the next winter olympics
will be
in china
okay so i think we cleared it up japan
will be the next summer olympics
next winter will be china and
can we really send our olympic athletes
to a country we've designated as
being involved with genocide
can we i feel as if the olympics have
run their course
i don't think the olympics are useful
anymore in pre-internet days
i think the olympics were really really
good because it got all the countries
competing in a friendly way instead of
an unfriendly way
but with the internet and you know our
connectivity and the way we trade with
each other in the modern times
do you need an olympics because i don't
care about the olympics
and and by the way i think the olympics
are terrible for athletes
just terrible because for every person
who makes it to the olympics
you have what thousands of people who
dedicated their entire
youth to trying to get in the olympics
and failed
what a waste what a waste the olympics i
believe
are not a positive force in the world
they don't add enough
but they definitely subtract for all the
thousands of athletes who wasted their
youth
trying to train for something that
didn't happen for them
just so a few can win some skiing and
shooting and lifting contests
that you don't care about i mean why
does any of this matter
is ridiculous so i don't think we should
send our athletes to the olympics in
china i think that china does has not
has not met what i would call a minimum
requirement
to host something that is meant for
you know peace right the the point of
the olympics is everybody gets along
i don't think china met the basic
criteria for that
now this would be of course a tragedy
for the
athletes who have trained and qualified
for the olympics
but let them join the other people who
didn't make the olympics
right if there are thousands of other
people who trained all their
you know they trained and trained and
didn't make the olympics if you
if you throw a few hundred more into the
mix who also trained and don't go to
get to go to that olympics it isn't that
different
but it would be it would be uh
sending a signal that we're kind of okay
and normalize
the genocide against the uyghurs let me
put it this way
if we attend the olympics we have
normalized
um genocide we would have normalized
genocide don't think i don't think we
can send our olympic athletes there
but i think we will unfortunately
uh maggie haberman is reporting that
trump has a list of republicans he wants
to punish
governor of georgia liz cheney somebody
else is on the list
and i told you before that one of
trump's superpowers
is that he makes the biggest difference
between
how he treats you if you're good to him
and you help him
versus how he treats you if you're not
good to him and you're on his bad side
that's one of the tricks of power is
that you want to make the biggest
difference
between being on your side and not being
on your side because then when people
make choices
they say i don't want to get that guy
mad
or i do want to make that guy happy guy
or gal
so on one hand
you could certainly see it as a flaw
that he's out of office and looking for
revenge
yeah it's hard to defend being out of
office
and looking for revenge like i'm not
going to defend that
but i will tell you that somebody who
has that characteristic
is going to go far in this world whether
you like it or not
because that's the maximum distance
between being on their good side
and being on their bad side and when you
establish that as your brand
which trump has quite successfully
gives people a reason to want to be on
your side
or at least not to sell you out if if
you've been on that side um
so as i mentioned yesterday i tweeted
cheekily
that you know given that trump is being
impeached after he's left office
i said is it too late to impeach george
washington for owning slaves
i don't see how we can let that slide
how do you think
democrats responded to my tweet
saying why not impeach george washington
for slavery
well if you think that i tricked
democrats into
supporting slavery you'd be correct
i actually had a bunch of democrats
coming in to support
slavery now the way they did it was they
said
scott you have to understand that in
their
in their opinion what trump did is
probably insurrection and against the
law
that's like breaking a law but scott you
don't understand
in the time of george washington it
wasn't illegal
it wasn't illegal to own slaves and so
the democrats tell me
that george washington owning slaves
scott that's not impeachable it's not
even
a crime if you looked at it in a
historical
context that's right
no joke i actually tricked i didn't do
it intentionally it was
so i won't call it the trick i trapped
accidentally
democrats into defending slavery
as not really that bad because it wasn't
technically illegal at the time
now if you've wondered how bad is tds
could you get somebody to defend slavery
just so they can be anti-trump and the
answer is
you don't have to wonder anymore i did
it right in front of you
i didn't do it intentionally but i
created an accidental test in the wild
you know not a randomized control test
but
still an interesting one
let me give you my most interesting
example
so so in response to my tweet about
impeaching george washington larry
charles
you may know him as writer director he
was you know one of the original
seinfeld writers and he was also the
executive producer on the dilbert
uh the dilbert animated tv show for a
while so i know him well
from working with him there and he also
went on to direct borat
and he was a showrunner on matt about
you very successful guy
right and very smart very talented
and but he's very anti-trump
so he and i sort of went different
directions on on the trump thing
but i've known him well since he worked
on i mean at least i knew him well
during the time that
we're working on the show so here's what
he said
to my tweet he said it would be good if
at least some of the people who make
this fallacious argument
talking about my impeach trump's impeach
washington stuff fallacious argument
admit that owning another human being is
barbaric
what let me read this again
larry charles says it would be good if
at least some of the people who make
this fallacious argument
admit that owning another human being is
barbaric
what what
is it was there somebody who was
pro-slavery
somebody thought owning another person
in the year
2021 somebody thought that maybe that
was just okay
what are you imagining larry now here's
what's interesting about this
you're you're all used to seeing people
make crazy tds
you know trump derangement syndrome
comments
on the internet but usually it's people
you don't know personally
right it's usually just some rando and
you say to yourself
oh i know the problem here the problem
is the person making
the comment is stupid or they're
uninformed or they're intentionally
lying or so you have a theory about why
that person is acting the way they are
except what happens when you know the
person personally
larry charles is really really smart
which is why he's also really successful
and here's the here's the funniest part
you know how i always mock people online
for not
understanding a joke larry charles
writes
jokes for a living he's written jokes
with me he and i have written jokes
together
and somehow he's not quite seeing that
i'm joking
the point of my tweet of why don't we
impeach
george washington is not that it's the
same situation
i'm not i'm not saying george washington
and trump are the same guy
who did the same offense i'm not saying
that how would you interpret it that way
that would be kind of a weird way to
interpret it
let me tell you how you should interpret
my tweet impeaching george washington
would be
a waste of time right
likewise impeaching trump after he's
left office would be
a complete waste of time that's the
point
the point is not that trump and
washington
are the same guy doing the same things
the point is that they're both waste of
time
now democrats will argue they're not
waste of time
because it might prevent trump from
running in the future
to which i say that's not going to
happen
in what world do you think trump could
successfully
and the successfully part is the part
that matters
in what world do you think he could
successfully run for president again
i mean he could run but successfully
that door is really closed would he run
for
you know some people are just for fun or
speculating he would run for
the senate and in florida he's not going
to run for the senate after being
president
that nobody does that all right and
certainly he's not going to do that
so any any notion somebody says
don't count him out uh i'll let me let
me acknowledge this
um he does have a way of coming from
behind etc
so so he is definitely that a comeback
kind of personality and so if you say
don't count them out i get what you're
saying
you know i get it as a concept
but there are way too many people who
supported him before
who would say i think he's aged out you
know i think
i think the way things ended the
coronavirus
situation for example just makes it
impractical for him to run again
so given the impracticality of it it's
just a waste of time
to impeach him it's nothing but revenge
and
trying to basically paint paint all
republicans as insurrectionists so
i see the impeachment trial as a way to
impeach
citizens i don't think it has much to do
with trump
it's a way to impeach republicans for
having supported him that's what it
feels like to me
so in a sense the senate is
uh impeaching me
and impeaching anybody who may have ever
supported trump about anything so i feel
like i'm getting impeached
quite uh quite seriously all right
so just wrapping up on the larry charles
thing um
larry charles is one of the greatest
guys in the world
let me just say that as clearly as
possible when i talk to anybody who's
ever worked with him
they freaking love this guy and so did i
i mean i do
i mean i just love the guy he's just a
really good person
in my opinion but he doesn't like trump
and i think that may distort his
perceptions
in an interesting way but he's a great
guy um
rand paul gave a terrific speech in the
senate in the senate
trial and i saw some
real leadership there that i liked a lot
and he
the point he made if i could just
summarize it is that
no democrats were asking if bernie
sanders
said something that incited violence
and he gave examples and nobody said
that
well i guess bernie sanders says things
that
you could interpret as inciting the
person who shot steve scalise luckily he
survived
and then he went on saying no democrat
we'll ask whether maxine waters incited
violence when she literally told her
supporters to confront trump officials
in public
and that's pretty direct that's pretty
direct
and so he goes through the you know the
complete
hypocrisy and
when he was done i thought that was
really good i really like the way he
he took it because his point was not
that we should
impeach these democrats the point is
that we should treat it the same
and live in a world with free speech and
if you don't live in a world with free
speech you're in big trouble
so the the bigger the bigger principle
is not to punish each other but to live
in a world with free speech
uh i love the way he presented it his
presentation was
strong lots of leadership said the right
thing but
have i ever told you that the hypocrisy
argument
is not persuasive
i say it a lot the hypocrisy argument
has no persuasive power
it's just an observation you should
definitely make it
you should definitely make the you know
point it out
when somebody's being hypocritical it's
part of the mix
but nobody ever changed their mind
because hypocrisy had been pointed out
he he needed some little extra juice on
that
to put it over the line because as i
understand that five republicans
joined the democrats to kill his point
of order that would have stopped the
process
so the people who objected the ones you
would imagine susan collins lisa
murkowski
mitt romney ben sasse batumi so people
who are known to be
mildly republican went to the other side
so it didn't work out but
i thought it was some of the best
leadership i've seen and
it's too early to back somebody for
president for 2024
but he's on the short list i think rand
paul
is i've said it before one of my
favorite
uh reasonable politicians he and
unfortunately
he might be too rational to be president
meaning that the public won't understand
a person who's trying to follow the data
and speak
logically and speak to principle
i don't know if the public can even
appreciate that anymore it's like it
doesn't exist as a
as a path to the presidency it's like
it's almost as if you have to lie to the
public
and you have to be irrational to get
anything done
and you know of course i've argued that
forever
i've seen a number of people suggest a
ticket of
rand paul and um let's see
let me just look at who said this uh and
as user fart storm just said
of course i had to look up your name and
it happened to be fart storm
but it's with a ph fart but tulsi
gabbard as a
vp now of course let me say what every
woman who just heard that
will probably say quite rightly why
would it be rand at the top of the
ticket in tulsa yet
as the vice president why don't you
reverse that
perfectly good question and uh i have
nothing to add to that it's just
it's a perfectly good question um
so that would be a strong ticket that
would be pretty strong
whichever way they went that would be a
strong ticket
alan dershowitz says weighed in on this
question of whether the president
can be impeached after leaving office
what do you think he said
what do you think alan dershowitz says
about whether
trump can be impeached after leaving
office
well alan dershowitz does this thing i
i didn't even know this was fair but
apparently he did it
and you can get away with it ah i can't
believe it but
and this is weird you're not going to
believe it when i tell you but he read
the constitution
did you know you could do that that you
could read the constitution
and then it's got words in it and if you
read the words you'll know what it means
i i didn't even know that was a thing
but thanks to alan dershowitz who did
read the constitution and he tells us
this
you know and of course i literally had
never looked at the words
that are relevant to this point so i'm
glad that
dershowitz did he says that the
constitution says
something like this quote that the
president shall be removed from office
on impeachment
and conviction
not by the expiration of his term before
the impeachment and that he also says
that mandate
mandates that quote judgment and cases
of impeachment shall not extend further
than to removal and disqualification
so the constitution refers to removal
and disqualification what does the word
and mean it means both
right this and this
if it meant one or the other what would
be the word that they would use instead
of and
it's a word or if the constitution had
allowed you to
to remove somebody from office
and or disqualify them
then you could have the and which would
be both
or optionally you could have the or
so that you could have just one or just
the other
but it doesn't say and or and it doesn't
say
or it says and
how do you interpret and as anything but
both of them
right and given that that's not an
option
to do both of them because he can't be
removed from an office he's not in
doesn't the constitution quite clearly
and unambiguously say
as dershowitz apparently is arguing that
you can't
you can't remove from office somebody
who's gone and therefore you can't
satisfy the and
therefore the framers did not intend it
to be something
after office um
sounds like a good argument to me and as
i've said many times
if dershowitz has an opinion just just
stop having your own opinion
just take his opinion it's going to be
better than your opinion
right he does this well you don't
just wait for his opinion and just adopt
it he's one of the few people
who is willing to take an opinion on any
political side
by following the law once you find
somebody who can do that
oh and by the way i would add him to my
list
of people you should look to
to know if the news is real or not
here's a here's a question
how do you think historians will
describe the 2021
um uh let's say assault on the capitol
do you think that when time has gone by
and that the serious historians not
not biased people just serious
historians who just want to get it right
they don't have a political bias a few
years have passed
nobody nobody's going to win or lose
anything because of their opinion
what are serious opinion serious
historians going to say
are they going to say it was an
insurrection are they going to say it
was a coup
or are they going to say things got out
of hand and
people people did some things they
shouldn't have done
i feel as if no historian is going to
label this
as an insurrection and if they do
i don't think you could ever trust
history again well you probably
shouldn't trust it now
you know history is always written by
the winners but
will it matter say in 10 years from now
if a historian is just trying to get the
story right
i don't think they're going to take a
political position on it and call it the
big lie
i don't think they're going to call it
anything but a protest they got in hand
because what is the argument for it to
be an insurrection
who goes to an insurrection uh
and thinks yay if we get control of this
empty room
we rule the country was anybody thinking
that
and suppose the worst case had happened
suppose they'd taken a hostage
and suppose the hostage had been worst
case scenario
mike pence or nancy pelosi
nobody wants to see any of that kind of
stuff happen but what if it had
would that group have then been in
charge of the united states
no literally
nothing works that way you can't conquer
a country
by controlling their empty rooms
and one or two politicians that's not a
thing
the the beauty of living in a democracy
is that you can take
the leader of the country you could have
kidnapped the president
and and it wouldn't change the nature of
the country because the leader is not
the country
now if we'd been you know a dictatorship
or something maybe taking
you know removing the dictator would be
a you know that would be an actual
coup but since we don't have a dictator
you could remove all of them
and the country would just go on ticket
we would just elect some more and just
keep on going
we would just pretend the
insurrectionist didn't exist
so how do how do historians call that
any kind of an insurrection it's going
to be pretty ridiculous
so there's a bombshell story from seth
abramson
it's a bombshell you're not going to
believe this story
it was a shocker and everybody's buzzing
about it and it goes like this
uh on january 5th at the trump
international hotel
and you're not you're not going to
believe this uh
a number of people got together
did you believe it bombshell
whoa yeah some people
got together yeah in some rooms
they'd talk to each other and
i don't think we can let this stand
that's the kind of that's the kind of
bombshell reporting
that we're looking for from our
journalist class
so seth abramson i think you've done a
solid
thing for the world by revealing and
it's shocking
it really is shocking that there were
people who met
and i don't even know how to say this
but
they talk to each other yeah they did
they talked to each other there may have
been
questions and replies they could have
gone it that far
it could have gone as far as people
asking questions or offering opinions
and then people replying
that's how bad things got in the meeting
where a few people
got together and talked and
i feel as if something must be done
about this now
seth of course added some extras to the
story
to make it a bombshell and one of the
extras is
what if what if
and by the way there's no evidence of
this but what if
the people who were talking
had suggested or communicated with
some of the protesters who ended up in
the capital
and told them you're gonna have to get
inside the capitol
huh because as seth abramson
points out what would be the point of a
protest where people are just standing
around
saying what they like how is that going
to change the
outcome that was the process that was
happening at that moment
you know inside inside the building and
so
seth abramson assumes or not assumes but
he
let's say he speculates that there's a
possibility
a strong possibility that there's a
smoking gun in here
and there's somebody in that room they
may have talked to each other
and decided to send the message to maybe
ali
alexander there's some reporting that
kimberly guilfoyle may have placed a
phone call
to ali alexander who is organizing the
stop the steal
now because that's reported how
likely is it true that
kimberly guilfoyle placed a phone call
that evening
to ali alexander what should you assume
about the likelihood that that's true
it's
reported by you know a notable national
journalist
type i would say
coin flip 50 50. any story about
um somebody said they saw something
and somebody thought somebody did
something
it doesn't matter the source that's
that's no better than a 50
chance of being true so if it's a coin
flip
it's almost like it didn't happen might
happen
maybe didn't well it's not the same as
it
you know as nothing being reported but
the speculation that people who talk to
each other
may have committed a crime which would
have been
inspiring an insurrection to get into
the building which would be
the the high criminal part
why is it a bombshell that people who
talked
might have been plotting a crime because
isn't that true of every group that
talks
is there any group that talks privately
who you could say for sure if you
weren't in the room
where they were not plotting some crimes
i i've been in corporate meetings in
which we were plotting crimes
but you know i suppose i suppose anybody
could
pull out a crime but that's not a story
that people got together and talked if
that's all you know
trying to connect that to some chain of
events that would
make them all criminals and you have to
go to jail
that is a stretch that's a stretch
and it's also a stretch for something
ridiculous
because seriously seriously
do you think do you think that the
people
in that meeting the you know that do you
think that don jr
eric uh kimberly guilfoyle
do you think that uh i guess corey
lewandowski bunch of people
do you think that that group of people
literally
were suggesting that somebody get into
the capitol buildings
i don't think so that is the least
likely thing
that could have happened in that meeting
and is reported as
oh there's a good chance x happened
when any reasonable person would say i
think
i'm a reasonable person in my opinion
it's the least likely thing that
happened
the least likely thing is that they
called for
that kind of you know that kind of
approach insane
all right michael schellenberger was
tweeting that apparently
in california i'm so proud of my state
prisoners people actually in jail
have stolen 31 billion
what let me try to finish this sentence
uh murderers and other prisoners in
california
have stolen 31 billion
okay if i'd heard that prisoners in
california had stole
stolen 31 dollars
i'd say to myself well that sounds like
criminals
criminals will steal your 31 dollars
don't turn around and leave that on the
table because those criminals
they're going to take your 31 dollars if
they'd said 3 100
i'd say that sounds about right maybe
3100 yeah okay
30 30 000 i'd say that's a lot
but yeah maybe that could have been
stolen um
if they'd said 310 000 they stole
i would have said maybe prisoners can be
pretty clever
they may have gotten that much if they'd
said 31 million
i would have said come on come on
they're prisoners
they're literally in prison
how do you steal 31 million dollars
while you're in prison it wouldn't sound
believable to me
and in fact it's not believable they
stole 31
billion
billion and here's the best part of the
story
or the worst that the person who is in
charge the california labor secretary
is who joe biden has uh tapped to be his
department of labor secretary
so the the person who is in charge of
that
just got promoted so
there's your news perfectly normal
if you let prisoners still steal 31
billion dollars from you
that's grounds for promotion and the
democrat party
um apparently in chicago there were some
it was a
meeting of white supremacists so
there were 80 white supremacists who
rallied in downtown chicago
but a researcher for the adl which is
the
what is the adl they look for they look
for
people like white supremacists so they
have some authority in this
situation and they said the good news is
that's pretty much the entire membership
of the group
nationwide so there were 80 people who
came to chicago white supremacist
but it's probably all the white
supremacists in the entire united states
who are part of
that group now before you say
ha ha there are only 80 in the united
states
it doesn't take many white supremacists
to do a mass murder
right now i would imagine most of those
80 people
are perfectly peaceful but have you know
odious
opinions but out of 80 people
who would label themselves white
supremacists do you think there's nobody
in the 80
if they're willing to publicly label
themselves as white supremacist
you don't think anybody in that 80 would
do something
bad on a big scale so i would definitely
worry about 80 white supremacists
especially if they have any kind of
organization
but the other context is this is one
organization
and it doesn't uh it doesn't
mean that there aren't you know the kkk
it doesn't mean that there aren't
other groups like this but here's a
question for you
how many people are in antifa
if i would like to know uh by
official accounts how many white
supremacists there are that's a good
thing to know uh any is too many
and but i'd also like to know you know
how many in the kkk
how many in whatever militias that may
have bad opinions
in in the opinion of these people but
i'd also like to know how many people
are in
antifa antifa and how many people in
black lives matter who you know would
call themselves members or so
wouldn't you like to know that let's
let's see the membership numbers of all
the groups
because i'm not going to i'm not going
to run away from
you know labeling any of them i'm not
going to run away from labeling anybody
a white supremacist group
if they are and i'm not going to run
away from labeling
antifa as a domestic terrorist group
if they are so let's let's just get the
whole number
why do we only hear the number of white
supremacists
antifa is an idea that's right
um somebody say the white nationalists
want separation
so you're making a distinction between
white nationalists and white
supremacists
are you claiming that the people who
went to chicago call themselves white
nationalists as opposed to white
supremacists
i don't know what your point is but
there is a difference
i've argued that there's no such thing
as white
supremacists because i don't know of any
white person who hasn't noticed that
other ethnic groups are doing better
than the white supremacists themselves
that the weird thing about white
supremacists is they tend not to be the
people who are super successful in life
and they're looking at other ethnic
groups who have
members who are completely successful
so there how how do you have a
philosophy
that you personally are a supremacist
over somebody who's doing way better
than you're doing
the other they're way smarter if you did
a standardized test they would beat you
specifically
you know forget about any general
averages or whatever you think about
that
the the people that you're uh you're
discriminating against or want to
have a lot of people in that group or
are killing it way better than you are
in every way right they're people who
have more talent
more brains better looking you know you
name it
there's no characteristic in which the
white supremacists themselves personally
are not far outstripped by
lots of members of every ethnic group
and so how is it that uh
you know how is it that they're
supremacists i don't know
if you i guess you can find 80 people
who will believe anything but i don't
even know how that makes sense
um some say they should be doing better
except for
as the competent are saying is they're
blaming jews for holding them back
but again that's the opposite of being a
supremacist
that's just being a racist now i'm
certainly claiming that there are plenty
of racists in the world
i'm not denying that that's the most
probably one of the most
common things you'll find anywhere but
finding people who literally think
they're superior
i think that ended some time ago
but they're certainly white nationalists
and there are
people who are racists of all kinds the
white nationalists are kind of a special
category
because i do think that you could be a
uh so this is not my own opinion i'm
just talking about other people here
i do think that a person who is not me
could have the opinion that hey let's
just stop trying to get along and
let's be separate if we prefer being
separate
that's a reasonable opinion even if you
disagree with it
but it's not practical we don't have
really a practical way to
you know have everybody separated and
the minute you did that
you know the minute you separated by uh
by race
and you said to the white nationalists
hey white nationalists good news
all you guys can go live by yourself and
you will never be bothered by any other
types of people
what would happen immediately
immediately
the white nationalists would find ways
to fight with each other
it's just human you know that they would
decide that some are
rich and some are poor they decide that
some are
catholic and some are not they'd find
some reason to hate each other
so imagining that imagining that you can
identify a group and separate them and
then they can go live happily ever after
without having to deal with other people
a little bit
optimistic i just don't see it's
somebody says i'm guilty of mind reading
here
i'm just describing what a white
nationalist is
by definition and if somebody wanna
wants to live
with themselves uh you can want it
but i don't know how practical it would
be you just end up hating people for
other reasons
all right that is all i need to say
today
so as i understand it tomorrow morning
i'm going to wake up
and i i should have time to do one of
these
but um the next morning
i will be flying overnight so i'm going
to miss
uh i'm going to miss one so if you don't
see me
that's why and then i'll be back and
we'll be i'll be live streaming on
youtube
at the same time as periscope when i get
back
when periscope goes away as it will in
march um
i'll be streaming from at least youtube
and i'll add
probably add some platforms and if the
locals platform has streaming by
then i'll of course be using that
sticks what about sticks
where 33 masks i will
all right that's all for now talk to you
tomorrow
