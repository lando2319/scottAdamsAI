foreign
well good morning everybody
oh
is it my imagination or did you get
better looking
did you lose weight
are you working out
you look great this morning
but you know what would make you look
even better
yeah
the knowledge that you're part of
something bigger than yourself something
great something that connects us all
over the world yes it's the simultaneous
sip it's the most amazing thing that's
ever happened
really has it's amazing and all you need
is a couple of micro glasses tanker
jealous design the canteen jogger flask
I've asked to live in any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and will you join me now please for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
yeah it's called the simultaneous Sip
and watch your antibodies increase when
you do this you ready ready go
wow
I don't know if it felt the same on your
end but I could feel my antibodies
increasing yeah
bring on that covert I'm not afraid of
you
all right
it's funny on both uh
on both YouTube and locals you can't see
each other's comments but at the same
time everybody was people were saying
ah antibodies
that should be the new uh that should be
the new sign off after the Sip
ah
antibodies
all right well uh Andre is backhaus
tweeted a uh there's a study
there's shows that changes in voter ID
laws
uh don't affect anything
what
what
apparently it doesn't change the voter
registration it doesn't change the
turnout
do you believe that
changes in voter uh in voter ID laws
don't have any effect on anything
were you expecting that
I'm not I'm not sure I had an
expectation either way but here's
something I've always believed
if you were to do the Venn diagram
and I think I'll do this no I can't I
can't make that motion with my hands
it'll look like a white supremacist to
hand motion
imagine if you will
use your imagination imagine that this
hand is being held up in a fashion which
some would say would be the okay symbol
sort of a circular thing
and my other hand would be doing a
similar thing forming a circle which I
can't show you because I'll get canceled
but one of the circles would be not
overlapping with the other Circle a Venn
diagram with fingers if you will
and that Venn diagram with fingers would
show that there are zero people who
really want to vote
and can't figure out how
because of lack of voter ID
I feel as though
it's been
four years since we're looking for one
person who wants to vote and can't
figure out how
still waiting for our first one aren't
we
let me tell you something a little trick
for determining what's true and what's
not I use this one a lot
now like all of the techniques for
determining what's true they don't work
all the time
but what is that if the science
or let's say the data you know we all
say science but I could be statistics as
well let's say the science doesn't match
your observation
then you should raise a red flag right
there should be some skepticism if
you're if you're just observing the
world and what science or statistics
tells you is true is just clearly not
true
your observation doesn't match doesn't
mean your observation is right
I mean the reason we do science and
statistics is because your observations
are crap
you think you see patterns you don't you
think you see correlation you don't
so we're really bad at you know spotting
any correlation but
don't you think we'd be able to spot the
existence or non-existence
of a human
right do I have to be a scientist don't
have to be a statistician
there either is a person
who fits into the category of really
wants to vote but can't figure out how
because of voter ID problems
where's that person you would only need
to show me one
just show me one and I'd say oh I guess
I guess that person exists maybe there's
more of them
but you can't find one in four years
really in four years not one example of
an actual human being who just couldn't
work it out really wants to vote
feels feels strongly about politics
but not struggling enough to figure out
how to get an ID
no there are no people like that
they don't exist
we would have seen one of them by now
right
so
I'm going to call BS on on the fact that
voter ID changes anything and I agree
with the with the statistics because it
matches observation right
my observation is that none of these
people exist
and certainly there's a great incentive
for the news to produce these people
right if CNN could produce a panel of
people who couldn't figure out how to
vote
you don't think they would have done
that by now
or even how about man on the street or
less sexist person on the street
interviews
they would have done at least a person
on the street interview to say how much
do you want to vote
why aren't you doing it right it's all
missing
dog not barking
hear it do you hear that dog not barking
that's all those people who couldn't
figure out how to vote talking to you at
the same time complete silence
well coincidentally we also have a
report
I think the Federalist was part of this
and Molly Hemingway has a new book out
uh whose title I forget but somebody
will tell me in the comments let me just
say this
I have not read the book
I can't remember its name but somebody
will tell me rigged the book's name is
rigged
if you're not familiar with Molly
Hemingway
you should become familiar with her in
my opinion maybe the best political
Observer and commentator
I won't even call her a pundit because
she's better than pundit
pundit is almost a sort of an insult
but I would say in the top rung of
dependable
people who have a good take can frame
things right analyze a complicated
situation and know enough about it to
say something new very few people can do
that
she's one of them so I haven't I don't
know anything about the book
but if she wrote it
and you read books
um I think you ought to look into that
I'll probably look into it myself I only
heard about it today
so that's that's your helpful tip for
today you should be at least following
Molly Hemingway on Twitter one of your
strongest uh most reliable voices I
think
anyway there's uh some information that
Zuckerberg
uh basically bought the 2020 election
for Biden and the way he did it was
putting he and his wife putting over
400 million dollars into non-profits
that we're supposed to be you know
nonpartisan but basically funneled their
money to likely you know to boost the
turnout of likely Democrat voters
now was any of that illegal
was any of it
illegal
I don't think so
I think I think it was all legal right
should it be I'm not sure that our
system uh anticipated anybody that rich
because you would have to be like crazy
rich
to have so much money that had changed
the outcome of an election you know in
that way
um so keep in mind that we have credible
knowledge that Zuckerberg basically
bought the election
because he funneled it into the places
where it would matter the most and those
are the places that swung just the way
he hoped his his spending would would
make a difference I assume I mean we
can't read his mind but one assumes that
was a point
and so now we know this that there was
something fishy about at least the
fairness of the election if not the
legality of it I don't I don't have any
reason to think it was illegal I'm just
saying that it's a fishy process because
of money
now listen to Trump's statement which uh
what I saw it on social media I didn't
believe it
like I I thought it was fake news I
didn't think he really made this
statement
so keep in mind that my first impression
was this are you sure he said that like
I had to actually see it from some other
sources before I believed it
but he actually said this uh yesterday I
guess if we don't solve the presidential
election fraud of 2020 parenthetically
which we have thoroughly and
conclusively documented this is Trump
not me Republicans will not be voting in
22 2 or 24. it is the single most
important thing for Republicans to do
um
what do you think of that
good move good persuasion
because it seems to me that uh Trump is
taking Republicans out of uh contention
it looks like he is Con he's telling him
not to vote which would guarantee
another sweep by democrats
which would make it even less likely
that the election reform would happen
does this look like a mistake
to you
you know of course people sent it to me
immediately and said all right explain
why this is brilliant persuasion
well
I suppose it depends what you're trying
to accomplish
so here's what it did accomplish you got
attention
definitely got your attention
it allowed him because it got your
attention it allowed him to promote his
view that the election was stolen and
that he's got a conclusive documented
proof which I'm not aware of are you I'm
not aware of any conclusive documented
proof of that
but he gets to you know send that
message on on the signal that you know
his provocative statement carries that
signal so he wins that way so he gets
attention and he promotes his message to
mostly the base
and
but what do you think about this part
Republicans will not be voting in 20 or
2 or 24. now interesting the way he
worded it
he didn't say I'm going to try to make
Republicans not vote
right because people took this as a
threat
but read the words carefully he did not
say if you don't do this for me which is
fixed 2020 somehow like you can face the
past if you don't do this for me I will
somehow cause people not to vote
does he have that power I suppose he
does by influence but if you're a
Republican
would you listen to that advice
are there any Republicans who would not
vote
because Trump wasn't happy with 2020.
anybody
is there anybody here who would be in
any way influenced by Trump's opinion
that maybe people won't vote he's not
saying you shouldn't he's he's acting
like it's a prediction that's not a
threat prediction is not a threat
yeah it's all
oh I say yes
Paul
Paul
collider says yes I'm not sure you mean
that exactly
you're you're uh you're a provocateur
poll
so I'm not you might have some uh
so I say another yes now it wouldn't
take many yeses to change the election
right
suppose Trump is right
but it's only five percent
five percent
would change the result of every
election right
so I'm not sure he's wrong
there might be some impact on
um
but it would be irrational
you know the rational thing to do would
be to you know make sure you vote and at
least nail that down and then also work
on Election Integrity here's some advice
for Trump if he wants to win
if Trump wants to win
let go of 2020.
and make it about fixing election
Integrity for the next president
the one after him
make it about the president after you
and you can be our president again
right
I mean I I think many of you probably
have the same feeling I do which is I'm
not so sure we want somebody of this age
Trump's age
and somebody who's as provocative and
you know could be as divisive as he
could be I'm not sure you all want that
if it turns out he's the best option I
could probably support it again but I
don't know that he will be I don't know
that the the primaries will necessarily
produce
him as the candidate he certainly has
the you know the front position and it's
his to lose
but you know he just have to say
something a little extra provocative
maybe and
maybe maybe it's over
so
um I'm not sure this is his best move
his best move would be to say you elect
me and I will make it a top priority to
make sure that the next election
you don't have any questions about just
elect me overwhelmingly get the
Republicans in there and our top
priority will be to fix the election
system do you know why that probably
won't happen
because the Republicans don't want to
fix it
there are probably too many states
where the Republicans have some kind of
weird advantage and they just want to
keep it
so as long as there are some states that
like the broken system the way it is I
don't know if you can get anything done
but I would certainly be more likely to
support
Trump or any anybody who ran on this
platform to say we can't fix it that you
know it's too soon to fix it right away
but it's got to be a national priority
we will figure out how to make and
here's the specific way to do it don't
just say make elections Fair
because that's just too subjective who
knows what that means be very specific
that by year 2028
will have a system in which we can
instantly audit and you will know if
you're if your vote was counted
how about that
just a very specific goal to have an
instant audit so everybody can find out
if their vote got counted by 2028
I would elect that guy
or that woman whoever whoever comes up
with that view in fact I'll even go
further
you want you want something really
provocative that'll lose half of my
audience right now
if a Democrat runs on that platform I'm
gonna I'm gonna support him
sorry
top priority
top priority if a Democrat runs on the
platform of making our voting instantly
auditable to get rid of all this
uncertainty
I will support that Democrat and I don't
care what the other policies are
is that is that clear enough
I don't care what the party is I don't
know who care who the candidate is if
they look like they could deliver that
fix the elections I will I will wipe
from my mind all the other stuff
because I don't think they can
necessarily push through you know
socialism
I don't think that's going to happen I
think there will be enough pushback that
you know there will be massive problems
even the infrastructure Bill couldn't
get passed
so I'm not too worried about things
getting out of control no matter who's
in who's president
but if you give me this one thing
just give me the one thing fix the
elections make them and
I'm good
because everything else depends on that
right if you can't be sure that you
elected the person you elected
everything else falls falls apart
give me one thing make it good and
you've got my support
it's not going to happen don't worry
about it nobody's gonna run on that
I guarantee nobody's gonna run on that
platform
all right
um I ran through my what I call my fake
news filter
I probably need to retweet that link
every now and then so it's a right now
it's just a Google Sheets page with a
essentially a checklist of things to ask
yourself
to know whether your news is fake news I
ran through it a few stories that we
don't yet have the conclusive evidence
for whether it's true or not but the one
I ran through was the story about the uh
transgender sexual assault in lewdown
County
now the part I'm not questioning
is that a sexual assault occurred
everybody hear that
everybody hear that clearly
I'm not I'm not a skeptical that a
sexual assault occurred I don't know
that it did it's just that's not the
topic I'm questioning the topic I'm
questioning is the nature of the
assailant
was the was the assailant wearing a
skirt
or a dress I guess some some like let's
say skirt was the assailant wearing the
skirt to quote gain access to the
women's room as part of the raping plot
uh sex let's say sexual assault
and
um I think it's fake news
I think is fake news and so today now
that a little time has gone by I thought
I'll I'll Google and I'll ask people do
we have any confirmation that the
assailant was wearing
um a skirt
do you know there isn't any right
do you know there's no confirmation
in anything that would be incredible
of the student who is the assailant the
alleged assailant
wearing a skirt
so he says goal post no
uh no I'm I've never questioned whether
an assault took place because I'm very
much on the point of view that if a if a
woman or a man reports an assault
that I wasn't there so I take that
seriously which doesn't mean it happened
I'm just not doubting it okay so it's
different to say that it's credible
than it is to say that it's true so I
would say that any any initial report of
a sexual assault is credible
that's at first
right so I would treat them all
seriously at first
the part that I question
because and and let me say this as
clearly as possible I'm never going to
question
an initial claim of a sexual assault
on this or anything else so that's not
the topic the topic is is it really
about somebody who was wearing a skirt
to get raping Privileges and not
privileges but raping access
so here's the closest thing we can find
to that alleged assailant
wearing a skirt
it's a boy
who was sometimes known to wear a skirt
not a chance so here's the first part of
the story did you believe that it was
about a a trans person
the reporting is not that it's a trans
person
the reporting is that it's a boy
this is what the news says now do you
think that the news is insulting the
trans Community by calling a trans
person a boy in a girl's dress
do you think that the news the woke news
is referring to it as a boy in a dress
knowing that if it's really a trans kid
that is not the way you're going to
refer to it
I said yeah love you apologize for that
that's not why you're gonna uh not how
you're going to refer to the situation
it being the situation not the person
um
we do not have confirmation
that this student was wearing a skirt
during the assault
it is somebody who is known to where it
was a skirt
how often do you think this person wore
a skirt
[Music]
that was the veterinarian for my cat
I'll have to get back on that
all right the assault is what matters
not the skirt yes and no
so somebody's saying what matters is the
assault not the skirt
yes and no what matters to the victim is
the assault and what you know certainly
Society cares about the assault more
than anything but the skirt part is what
made it a national story
it's not a national story because
somebody got assaulted that's
unfortunately every day
it's the skirt that made you the story
I'm only doubting that part of the story
because it was
two on the nose
right so keep in mind
and and let me see if this is true give
me another fact check on this am I the
only
sort of you know National figure
you know somebody who's got some kind of
a platform am I the only person who's
questioning the story the skirt part of
the story
I haven't seen anybody else do it
yeah I might be the only person in the
world who's questioning it
um
was it permitted to be in the bathroom
no no
don't you think that the school would
have already told you
let me ask you this if it had been an
actual trans student
who had actual access to the girl's
bathroom
we would have heard that by now
you and by the way was there a lock on
the girl's bathroom I feel like anybody
could open the door and walk in I don't
know if the skirt part was important
all right enough about that
so I'm still doubting that one I could
be wrong so I asked this question on
Twitter
why is it so we've got all this uh truck
shortage in La so the ports are all
backed up for weeks or whatever because
there aren't enough trucks to unload the
goods and then distribute them
to which I ask
why is the cost of all the every other
good that they're carrying in other
words all the things are shipping the
price will go up because of shortage
why is it
you're blowing off the vet
oh no I'm not blowing off the vet I'll
get back to the vet in a minute
um
I thought you meant veteran but it was
the vet veterinarian you were talking
about
and so why is it that supply and demand
doesn't work for truck drivers
supply and demand works for all the
things on the truck
but not the driver
so we have a shortage of drivers
but the price we're willing to pay them
is not going up fast enough to get more
drivers
and how long does it take to train a
truck driver
yeah I see you say training seriously
how long does it take to train a truck
driver
I'm just asking
I would think two weeks
I would think two weeks and we didn't
see the problem developing
in time to train some truck drivers now
I've also heard that it's a combination
of things that uh I guess California had
some restrictions about green Stuff Etc
that made fewer people be able to have a
truck you have to have a newer truck you
gotta have a lot of insurance the pay is
low I guess the pay for a truck driver
has an increased in Forever
but maybe it is a little bit now
so I just have questions why we have
such poor visibility on what the hell is
going on now I get that as a complex
system and it doesn't take much to Bunch
it up
maybe it's just a shortage of trucks but
I feel like there's something else going
on so the Biden Administration somehow
was instrumental in getting the port to
open up for more hours
so they could just work overnight as
well as during the day
to which I said
what are you telling me the doubt the
docs were not already 24 hours
what
what
did you know that the docs didn't
already work around the clock
they're they're lined up for weeks and
only and only today somebody said you
know
if we work more hours
really
we're just figuring that out
seems pretty massively incompetent I'm
sure the unions were part of it I'm sure
they were
God knows what regulations but uh I feel
like Trump could have fixed that faster
do you run into problems all the time
where you say to yourself
I think Trump could have done that
no matter what criticisms you want to
level at Trump
and oops
you cannot plan for this amount of
volume
all right I'm looking at this so we have
a logistics professional
who says you can't you can't plan for
the increase in volume
well what caused that increase
the the increase is not
um
so I I see the comment but I understand
the comment
but you can I think you can can you what
is it that can cause the gigantic
increase in Imports we didn't see that
coming
backlog from the pandemic
so basically all it is is that the
pandemic is over and there's suddenly
more demand for Stuff
um but to the logistics uh expert here
I'm you know I certainly hear what
you're saying that I understand the
basic point it's a complex system if you
get a shock it just takes a while for
the system to adjust but
only today they figured out to work more
hours
right we're not talking about the
hardest Solutions in the world get some
more temporary trucks
do you think that the state and the
federal government
can't say temporarily hey we'd like you
to have these very green trucks that are
new we'd like you to have a certain
amount of insurance or whatever but it's
an emergency
so if you've got something with four
wheels bring it over here we'll we'll
fill it up
you don't you don't think that we could
have figured out some way to get some
extra trucks going
I feel like Trump would have made that
happen
don't you
I know I somebody had some kind of
regulatory
complication there that was holding it
up
National Guard who I don't know about
the National Guard but I don't think
they could ship enough to make a
difference
well there was a man in Norway who
killed five people with a bow and arrow
in a mass what would you call it Mass
arrowing
is it a mass shooting if he uses a bow
and arrow I'm going to call it a mass
arrowing
um
and I have mixed feelings about this
and I'm not proud of it
number one this is a horrible tragedy
and we of course have to think first of
all of the victims
horrible horrible tragedy you imagine
this imagine I mean I can't even imagine
being
part of this so on one hand it's the
worst it's just horrible tragedy and our
thoughts go with the victims
on the other hand
I'm always impressed by good work no
matter where I see it
and here's a guy who is actually
kill five people
how fast and how accurate do you have to
be with a bow and arrow
to get five people
the crowd can get to him
and after the first person got hit with
an arrow
weren't people saying hey
hey where'd that Arrow come from it's
over there hey he's loading up another
arrow
I can see why he would get a second
person
but how did the fifth person
not figure out how to get out of an
arrow range
and how quickly can you shoot Five
Arrows I mean it must have been like you
know who is
who's that Superhero on The Avengers
Hawkeye yeah it looks like Hawkeye you
know
foreign
you can't even do it on TV without fast
forwarding it with CGI
now it could be that people were falling
over dead
and nobody could figure out where it was
coming from for a while
somebody says Five Arrows in 30 seconds
is that what a oh high capacity quiver
is that a thing
is there a high capacity quiver wait
you're joking right
um oh he killed old people
um
yeah maybe the fact that it was silent
and the old people were just probably
crumbling
yeah it probably took the full 30
seconds for people to figure out even
what was going on huh if you'd heard a
shot you would have immediately known
what was happening and people would have
dispersed that probably isn't so I think
there was some report that this person
was recently radicalized to Islam
um
but uh
that's a weird one well the funniest and
best entertainment of the week is Joe
Rogan had Sanjay Gupta on have you seen
the clips uh so Sanjay Gupta is the the
Medical
uh
professional on CNN
and uh
I'll tell you based on the clips I saw
this is some good stuff so let me give
you some highlights for this
so as you know famously uh Joe Rogan
got coveted and he took Ivermectin among
other things all prescribed by doctors
and CNN and others decided to say that
uh Joe Rogan was taking horse dewormer
now you I don't have to explain to you
that the drug Ivermectin was designed
for people and that wanted a Nobel Prize
that works great for people but there's
also an animal version so
CNN saying that Joe Rogan was taking you
know horse dewormer
is fake news
and there's no other way to say it this
is fake news
and so he challenges
Sanjay Gupta
you know during the interview he says
this is a quote from Rogan talking to
Sanjay Gupta he says does it bother you
that the network you work for out and
out lied just outright lied about me
taking horse dewormer
I think Sanjay was not quite you know
ready to defend everything that other
people had said on the network because
it's not something he said so there's no
indication that Sanjay Gupta ever
referred to it that way and and you know
he's more credible than most people
there
uh
and then Joe said why would they lie and
say that's horse dewormer Rogan asked
and that I love this Rogan asked he says
I can afford people medicine
it's ridiculous I can afford people
medicine
[Laughter]
why that's so funny like I can afford
people medicine
[Music]
I don't actually I don't know why that's
funny
but yes
I guess that's why you use the
professional
um he says it's ridiculous it's just a
lie don't you think that a lie like that
is dangerous on a News Network when you
know that they know they're lying you
know that they know they're lying this
is what Rogan says
uh he says do you think that's a problem
that your News Network lies
that's freaking brutal the the best part
about this is that there's no question
on facts
there's nothing the CNN can say
that's like well you know we were sort
of right no you were sort of right
it was an intentional lie every time
they said it was an intentional lie it
wasn't sort of right
it wasn't a horse dewormer
so
and then he goes on he says this is Joe
Rogan still he goes my point is you're
working for a news organization if
they're lying about a comedian taking
horse medication what are they telling
us about Russia
what are they telling us about Syria
do you understand that that's why people
get concerned about the veracity of the
news
oh my God
that's about as perfect as as an attack
can be
um I always feel sorry
when somebody who's in one profession
let's say the medical profession Sanjay
Gupta comes up against somebody who's in
uh
who's one of the most famous capable
people in the world
as a short clear
jabbingly insightful things
and that's the sort of what made Joe
Rogan Joe Rogan that he can talk better
than other people can talk you know you
just communicates in a in a
nuclear-powered way that just ordinary
people just don't do and so this was
like not a fair fight so it was kind of
funny
but
here is something that surprised me
so given Joe Rogan's the size of his uh
audience I believe he said when he was
talking to Sanjay that you know he was
questioning the purpose of the
vaccination if you can get and transmit
the virus just as easily if you're
vaccinated which turns out not to be
anywhere near true
so it turns out that Joe Rogan was under
the impression that the vaccination
would not vastly reduce the odds of
getting the virus or and also the odds
of transmitting it
so that is a really really big
piece of information
to not be aware of if you have if you
have a platform right now this is a
criticism
this is a criticism of uh Joe who I love
by the way big fan
and I don't think that we should expect
the non-medical people to be right on
all the medical stuff
that's not a thing but
here he was here here was Joe with with
gigantic platform and he was corrected
on a really really fundamentally
important fact
that that the vaccination vastly reduces
the odds of getting infected and and
also reduces by a large amount the odds
of giving it to somebody else and of
course reduces the odds of having a bad
outcome
I feel
if Rogan takes this new information
and does well only somebody like him
could do
there are some people who just have
powers that other people don't have and
he hasn't
an ordinary person would have to bury
that
and just act like it didn't happen you
know because it would be embarrassing
to be that wrong on something that
important I mean vital to the health and
well-being of the country I mean it's
really really super important
so will Joe Reagan take this new
information
that to Sanjay Gupta
gave him and
incorporate that it is future
conversations about the topic
now people are asking if it's true it's
true that the medical community
um feels it's confirmed I guess that's
different than being true it's true that
the experts are pretty sure of that
based on the data they're they're very
confident in that that's doesn't seem to
be one of the things that there's a lot
of question about
so
I would love
oh and then then uh Rogan asks a
perfectly good question which is why do
people with natural immunity have to get
vaccinated it's a good question right
don't you wonder that too what's wrong
with my natural immunity
so here's another thing that Sanjay
Gupta knew that Joe Rogan didn't know
and I didn't know it either that natural
immunity doesn't work uh 30 to 40
percent of the time
what
did you know that
did you know that 30 to 40 percent of
the time people who actually get the
virus
can actually just get it again
how many of you knew that how many knew
that you can get the virus and then just
get it again because you didn't get
enough immunity the first time
now in the same way that you can get the
vaccination
and also get the virus but you're far
more likely to get the virus a second
time according to Sanjay Gupta
far more likely to get it a second time
if you
um are only have natural immunity
is that a good reason now let's take for
take for a moment if the information is
correct is would it be a good reason now
I can't confirm the data
but I'd say Sanjay Gupta is pretty close
to the real data nobody's
let me say this as far as I know nobody
has ever accused Sanjay Gupta of lying
about data right they all agree on that
Sanjay Gupta despite the fact he's on
CNN is a credible
credible person
you might not like it but he's credible
and I don't think he has any background
that would suggest he would do anything
but you know report what he what he
believed he he knew based on the facts
so that's actually a I see actually a
really good answer
the really good answer is that natural
immunity is great when it works but you
can't depend on it it's not nearly as
good as being natural immunity plus a
vaccination now I do think that that
might be the sort of thing that gets
revised later
it might be the sort of thing where
people say oh well we're wrong about
this we have to revise that maybe
I think it's in the category of things
that might be revised someday
but it's a good it's a good answer
all right here's another one Joe Rogan
brought up the myocardinas in kids from
getting the shot now you're all aware
that especially young boys I think are
more likely to get myocarditis which is
some kind of enlargement of the heart
it's treatable they're pretty much all
released
you know within I think a day or
something so almost nobody dies so even
the kids who get this it doesn't seem to
be a death sentence it's just something
that is inconvenient for a day or so
um but did you know that the risk of
getting that myocarditis is far higher
if you get the virus
there's a risk of getting it with a
vaccination that's a known risk Sanjay
Gupta you know acknowledges
but the risk of getting it if you don't
get the shot is higher because basically
we're all going to get the virus
eventually how many of you knew that
John says it's a lie
somebody says no bad assumption
so you're you're skeptical of the the
fact then right
all right
said who
so here's here's what I would challenge
you with and you can
you can you can challenge me right back
so so search for this do uh do a Google
search yourself
see and again I'm only saying what what
the expert opinion would be I'm not
telling you this is my opinion I'm not
telling you it won't change and I'll
tell you it's right
I'll just tell you it's the expert
opinion at the moment is that the data
says you're a much much higher chance of
the myocarditis if you're not vaccinated
and you're a kid
now
those are three really really important
facts wouldn't you say now again I say
facts
but maybe some of them will will be
revised at some point maybe we'll learn
more
uh I think that Joe Rogan was short
three really really important facts am I
right
so the way this is being reported is
that you know Rogan dunked on
CNN more than Sanjay Gupta and that's
true
he did dunk on CNN and he did it really
well and it was fun to watch
but
um I think the discussion with Sanjay
Gupta was really really good
because you know people watching Joe
Rogan probably are leaning you know
anti-vaxx is that true
check your facts as somebody says
I'm asking you to check them I've got a
good source Sanjay Gupta so argue with
him don't argue with me because remember
I'm not saying it's true
you don't need to argue with me I'm
saying that a person who surveys what
the experts says the expert said I can't
confirm it so don't get mad at the
messenger I feel like some of you are
getting mad at me
are you getting mad at me because I'm
not making any claims
I'm just telling you what other people
are claiming
don't get mad at me
just tell you what the landscape is
um
so I would like to say again that
uh Joe Rogan show it's like a you know
National Treasure
because it is at least it's one place
where people are not trying to lie
the one thing you could be sure about
with Rogan is he's not trying to lie
he's definitely not trying to mislead
anybody about anything
you agree with that right
like you watch CNN and you're you're
like I think they're trying to lie it
looks intentional doesn't it
but if Rogan is wrong about something
he's just he's just us
because we're wrong about stuff too
but he's not lying to you at least you
know that now look at look how valuable
this is
I always see the the glass half full
look how valuable this conversation was
this is the first time that there was
something like a polite detailed
conversation
between somebody who's a little you know
I'll say a little bit skeptical about
the vaccines or at least the Mandate
part of the vaccines and
somebody who had a little bit more
information
doesn't mean it's right but it was more
information
and this was really valuable
I feel I learned
I feel like I learned a lot of this so I
would like to say
um my highest compliments to both The
Joe Rogan and to Sanjay Gupta Dr Gupta
for in my opinion the most useful
information Exchange in the entire
pandemic
would you agree with that I think this
was the most productive
most honest
most useful
conversation on this topic that I've
seen so far so compliments to both
people they did great
uh Apple's looking into making their air
pods into a health device
so I guess they can turn their airpods
into a hearing aid without you know too
much work
it could read body temperature monitor
your posture and of course there are
other other things that you could do
with your phone and other sensors
so apples Apple's pretty serious about
this health stuff
um
somebody's asking me does Rogan have an
egg on his face
let me go back to
The Importance of Being free of
embarrassment
now I can't speak for him because I
can't get inside his head but does it
look like Joe Rogan is somebody who gets
embarrassed easily
I mean everybody can be embarrassed but
does he look like the guy who's going to
crawl under a rock if he said something
was wrong
no no
so when you say stuff like you know does
Joe Rogan have egg on his face or is he
embarrassed or anything like that I'll
bet no
about now
because it's an unproductive emotion and
I would imagine he's Beyond it I would
imagine he's more like what do you do
about it what works you know think about
tomorrow night yesterday kind of thing
that's that's just my guess I can't
can't get inside his head of course
you know what's interesting about this
apple thing is there's a an app called
Translate
that translates from English into any
other language and or into the major
ones and vice versa and it works really
fast
it works really fast
we'll show it to you
uh well I don't need to show it to you
just imagine it's fast now imagine also
that you've got your app up and you've
got your air your air pods in
how hard is it to have your phone just
translate in real time
just hold it up to the speaker and have
it just translate like a like a Star
Trek Universal translator it'd be a
delay
but with 5G
you know if you put uh let's say you put
Amazon's you know cloud computing on it
or Google
and you you give me 5G speed so it's
essentially instant and I just hold it
up to a native speaker of Spanish
I think it could translate
I think you could translate in real time
couldn't it could get really close real
time maybe uh
two or three second delay
something like that
I've been doing that since 2017. yeah
you it's it's it's been doable for
several years but not really well
it hasn't reached that you know good
good level yet but it's almost there 5G
won't be a big part of that
but here's a provocative thought that I
put out there in the beginning all these
little uh Health apps are going to be
useful
you know so something will say uh hey
you better take a drink of water because
you're dehydrated
now the first time your phone tells you
to take a drink of water because you're
dehydrated you might say to yourself ah
I'm busy
yeah I'll get to it but sometimes you
might take the drink of water
and then you say to yourself oh wow I do
feel better
that perked me up a little bit I guess
this this app was right I needed to get
some water
eventually the app will be so useful
that it will feel
you just like you can't say no
there will very quickly become a point
where your your health apps train you to
do what they tell you
it's going to tell you to take a walk
it's going to tell you to go to sleep
it's going to tell you what to eat it's
going to tell you to eat less of it it's
going to tell you to sit up it's going
to tell you to hydrate it's going to
tell you when to take your pills
and the first
is just going to be convenient
it's just going to be convenient
uh but eventually it will just control
you because it will train you like a dog
to do whatever it tells you because if
you follow the directions of the AI long
enough
it will train you to do the next thing
it tells you
because you get in the mode it's like oh
my AI told me to take a drink take a
drink it works every time it's good for
me
I'm not doing it because the AI told me
I'm doing it because it's good for me
we are going to be trained like dogs to
respond to AI
and we'll do it to ourselves
because we don't think it's that
important you just think you're doing
what makes sense yeah I'm dehydrated it
told me I took a drink
eventually you'll do anything it tells
you
because it's been right so far
all right
uh Texas versus the federal government
and Joe Biden so Texas governor as a
band any vaccine mandates in in Texas
but of course the federal government
says
says the opposite so Southwest Americans
are both going to follow the uh the
federal guideline not the state
guideline an interesting fight
an interesting fight
so
not much to say about that except we'll
watch that develop and
I feel like
I don't know I feel like the market
should be taking care of this
um
hopefully it'll go to the Supreme Court
yeah maybe
Federal mandate has not been issued just
stated
but I think the companies probably want
to get ahead of it the companies would
probably comply just on the statement
before it's before it's official I would
think
now does anybody know what percentage of
Pilots are walking out or
or pretending they're sick or whatever
I don't know what percentage it is if
it's not a big percentage right
somebody says 40 percent I don't think
so 30 percent
I think the number that would actually
walk out would be less than 10 percent
and and if it's two percent that's not
going to surprise me
I don't feel like it's 30 or 40. I think
it's going to be under 10 and closer to
two
all right here's a um Sean says here's
the study group decided they say right
in the study that the data is garbage
and also that it doesn't show causation
let's see if I can open that up
uh it doesn't show causation
causation of of uh which topic was that
I can't open that right now
but was the Gupta study about the
reinfection or about the myocarditis
speed shooting is a regular part of
archery
makes sense
um
Pilots are turning down overtime work
it's not it's not the sickness or time
off
um
many are close to retirement and maybe
just using their sick leave before
retiring I've heard that
uh Gupta lied somebody says
well did he lie
or did you just refer to studies and
maybe the studies are wrong
um
boo update I'll have that later
all right that's all for now I have to
go do some other things and I will talk
to you
