tube that the sound isn't good I know I
actually gave you bad sound today
so I took the good equipment out of the
mix and if you're on YouTube
your sound will be bad
if you're on locals
your sound might be good I don't know
we'll find out even your video is bad on
low on YouTube
all right
well today is going to be one of the
best days you've ever had and it's going
to start with a little something I call
the simultaneous sip bin all you need is
a cupboard glass
I take your Chelsea Stein a canteen
Joker flask if that's all about a guide
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for
the best
the best thing that's ever happened to
you today it's called the simultaneous
up it happens now go
ah
well which of my faulty equipment would
you like to see me throw out a window
I've got uh I've got one of these I
could throw out the window
um I've got uh
let's see I've got one of these
I've got a I've got two printers that
aren't working
so I think I'm just going to have one
day where I just take all my broken
technology just throw it in a window
just for entertainment
and if you don't think that's serious
well you don't know me
because yeah
so I was going to read this yesterday
but it's still news uh the big headlines
yesterday that Bill Gates says he
regrets the time spent with Jeffrey
Epstein
he says quote it was a huge mistake
now
there are some kinds of stories
that you can write without research
this would be one of them
could you imagine the person who was
assigned to the story
can you give us a story about Bill Gates
ask him if he has any regrets about
being spending time with the most famous
sexual predator of all time
what do you think you'll say
I don't know somebody's gonna have to
ask him
because maybe maybe he would say it was
the best idea he ever had
could surprise you
could be news
but you send out your reporter and say
uh Bill Gates what do you think about
spending time with the most famous
sexual predator of all times
and it turns out
he regrets it
I know that comes as a big surprise to
all of us but uh yeah he probably got
together with his uh advisors and said
how do we handle this
should I should we just say
you know we really like the time we
spent with him and it was awesome I'd do
it again what do you think how do you
want to play this
but he played it a huge mistake that was
probably the right way to go
so uh are you waiting for the part where
I admit I'm wrong about the pandemic
does anybody want to see me
eat crow
tell you how wrong I was
here it comes
I was very wrong about the pandemic in a
particular way
so a uh one of my friendlier critics
explained this to me today he said Scott
when you talk about the statistics that
don't agree with you you say that they
are low quality and you point out how
unreliable data is and how unreliable
our
professional sources are
do I do that first of all
do it if something doesn't agree with me
if I see a statistic do I tell you that
the statistics are bad
if I do
if you see statistics from me that
coincidentally agree with my point of
view
do I tell you those statistics might be
wrong
what do you say what do you say in the
comments do I as often
tell you to be skeptical of stuff I
disagree with as stuff I agree with
ha ha
well a lot of it depends on which window
you're looking in because people don't
consume my content the same way some
people watch every day some people just
dip in and they'll see a certain story
and so
watch carefully
as I admit that I was wrong because
later you'll say I've never done it
and by the way I don't know if anybody's
ever admitted they're wrong more often
than I have in public literally wrote a
 book about it a whole book of
stuff that were mistakes and things I
did wrong a whole book
and the most common claim yeah you never
admit you're wrong all right here it
comes here's me admitting I'm wrong
I'm reasonably sure
that I don't
question the things that agree with me
the statistics as often
as the things that uh that don't agree
with me
I feel like that's actually a valid a
valid statement now the reason I don't
do it is that I tell you all the time
that half of all data is incorrect don't
trust anything and I figure that covers
it
but if I also say that the things that
don't agree with me are sketchy but the
thing I don't mention that when the
other things are that could be
misleading
so
I'll give you some examples
um let's see here's one uh experts say
masks are safe to wear that was the big
trending thing on Twitter today
a bunch of sources saying that they did
a bunch of studies and found out that
masks don't make you short of oxygen
they don't give you
any problems
right now does that point of view agree
with my point of view
or disagree well I'm anti-mask at the
moment for Freedom reasons and because I
think the risk is a certain size but
my earlier my earlier statements that
masks work and would be better on than
not not sure how much they work but that
they work
would be supported by these stories
so this is the sort of story that my
critics would say Scott I don't think
you're critical enough about
these statements that they don't uh they
don't have any negative effects so let
me say
I don't believe this do you I mean I
don't believe it's false
that Mass have no negative impact but I
don't believe that the data is credible
or reliable
now here's one of my uh
here's one of my little uh tricks for
knowing what is BS
look for when the science says one thing
but your personal observation is
different
that doesn't mean you're right could be
in the science is right and your
personal observation is wacky
but if they're all if they're out of
whack that should be at least a little
flag that says dig a Little Deeper
I wear a mask
and I have asthma
there's no way I can breathe the
same with a mask on
no way now I saw all the um the
doctors putting the oxygen meter on
and then they put the masks on one of
them put like six masks on and was still
able to breathe and it's actually the
meter still said 100 percent
so so you saw a bunch of doctors do that
right put on the mask oxygen meter was
fine therefore breathing's just the same
with a mask on are you are you convinced
they did it right in front of you
no because when I put the mask on I
can't breathe
does anybody have a different experience
you know I have asthma so I've got a
little little extra going on there but
does anybody have the experience that
you can breathe the same with a
mask on
no no this is obviously fake news it
happens to agree with my viewpoint
but it's also fake
right so here's the example where
something agrees with my general view of
life
but it's obviously fake now here's
what's probably going on
I don't know this for sure so this is
speculation hypothesis
we know for example that people who have
covid and their lungs are degraded don't
know it often do you know why they don't
know it
because they compensate they breathe
harder
but they don't kind of realize it so
they're they're getting enough but not
each breath but then they don't realize
it do you think the people who wear the
masks
have the same breathing pattern
as someone who doesn't in other words if
you went for a run with a mask on
would you have to work harder to get the
oxygen you need
probably but it wouldn't be a problem of
you not getting the oxygen it would be a
problem if you have to work harder to
get it exercise would be kind of
degraded
so
I would say that that's not credible
information but I also don't have any
reason to think that masks do hurt you
so I have no reason to think that masks
are dangerous
at least in terms of science but also no
reason to think that they're safe just
because this recent information says so
how about this one um
the CDC estimated a one-year decline in
life expectancy in 2020 a one-year
decline that would be gigantic it would
also agree with my world view
because I say the pandemic was real we
may have miscounted by 20 or something
but that wouldn't change the big picture
so I say the deaths are real and it's a
real pandemic and it's not like a
regular flu that's my world view so this
should agree with me right the CDC
estimating there's a one-year decline in
life expectancy that's exactly what I'd
expect
except it's they just
calculated it wrong
so Peter Bach goes through it in in the
publication
uh basically saying that they just made
a bad assumption and it's just all
 they just didn't know how to
calculate it right
so here's the example of something that
agrees with me well two examples two two
data points that agree with me that I
tell you I don't think either of them
are credible they just happen to agree
with me
so I don't think that I can keep this up
meaning that I doubt I will be as good
as I was today and tell you the things
that agree with me are also wrong but
I'll try to do better so I'm going to
say that the criticism that I haven't
done that enough in the past probably
valid
so here here I am admitting uh to an
error all right here's a well actually
here's another example there was a study
80 000 people I think in the UK
and it said that uh long covid uh or
just covet if you get coveted your IQ
will be lowered on average
and it's quite measurable it's like a
few points
now
does that agree with my worldview
it does
I if this were true
that uh that getting covered lowers your
IQ that would be right on point with my
world view which says that the long
covet you know the risk of getting
covered
um is is bad not just because you might
die but that the long-term consequences
so it agrees with my worldview but is it
accurate
well it took all of about a minute for
somebody who's good at looking at stuff
Donald luskin practicing economist
looked at it and said you know those 81
000 people you studied
they looked at 81 000 people and
eliminated almost all of them
from the study because there wasn't any
previous IQ information about it
so they could only find hundreds of
people
in the 81 000 that were even worth
studying
so when when the headline says 81 000
people were studied that's just
they started with 81 000 and then
throughout almost all of them because
the only ones they could use
were the ones where they had a fairly
recent IQ test so that they could
measure any difference
the whole story is just it just
happens to agree with me so would I have
been harsh to it
had it you know before this conversation
I don't know
you have to wonder
um but here was a comment that I'm I'm
sorry I missed but one of my I think
somebody who follows me
said this on Twitter that's a little too
a little too on the nose
right isn't it convenient
that you know the the powers that be
want you to get vaccinated and then
conveniently there's a study that says
if you don't your IQ is going to go down
now
would you know if your IQ went down two
points because you know sort of in that
range two three points would you know
no you'd think you did right talk to
somebody who's had covet tell them that
there's a study that says your IQ goes
down two points and then asks them
having primed them for the question now
now you've you've biased them hey
there's a study that says your IQ goes
down have you felt any difference since
you got the the virus what are people
going to say
two points yeah I feel like I feel that
got a little brain fog it was that time
I tried to calculate a tip on on the
restaurant and I you know I didn't get
it on the first right you're right
my IQ did go down
right yeah and then the comments so he
says with age
doesn't your IQ go down with age anyway
I had the same question so if you
studied people who let's say took an IQ
test 10 years ago
isn't the right Q lower
you know depending on which age group is
getting the most covid if they tend to
be skewing older if you look at a 60
year old
compared to a 50 year old
say my Q I don't I don't think so I
think it goes down a couple of points I
think
but I'm not sure so I don't believe the
story that covet lowers your IQ there
were only a few hundred people tested
and I don't think any of this sounds
credible to me it just happened to agree
with my worldview
there's a story that kids teens are
beating uh covet tests well in the
opposite way they're giving it a false
positive intentionally by putting Cola
and I guess some fruit drinks into the
test
and it makes it seem as if you have
covet and then you can get out of school
so you get two weeks off of school by
putting some soda in your covet test
now
I don't know if that's true
just like every other story I don't know
is that true do you think so
um
somebody says
uh
I'm not a psychiatrist but I can bet
Scott is a narcissist you don't have to
bat I can confirm it
the thing people don't understand about
narcissists is that there are two
different kinds
one kind likes to get its Supply as it
were the supply of praise and feeling of
worth from doing good things for other
people
is that a problem to you is it a problem
to you that I would like to get my
feeling of self-worth and any any praise
that Society wants to give me that I
would like to get that by doing good
things for other people
to earn that praise
is that a mental condition do you think
I'd need hospitalization for that
because that's one kind of narcissist
there's another kind that just and they
overlap of course but there's another
kind who just thinks they're a little
bit better or a lot better
than they really are
I'm also one of those intentionally I
always set my you know my expectations
of what I can accomplish I set a higher
than reasonable
because it gives me something to shoot
for and it lets me perform better so you
don't have to wonder if I'm a narcissist
I can confirm it absolutely I mean 100
everything about me fits those
categories but you may not know that
there's more than one kind
the malignant narcissist is just a whole
different deal and
um I may be one of those if I am I
wouldn't know it you know I certainly
have the other kinds for sure
but am I also malignant I don't know
could be I'm not the one who would be
able to know
anyway uh here's what I was gonna say
cold so Cola causes false positives on
tests and
it makes me wonder this
are you ready for some deep conspiracy
theorizing I know you are
you love conspiracy theories admit it
admit it you love them here's one
what if
wait for it
what if
a lot of the coveted positive tests
were people who just had a diet
Coke
and read a Dilbert comic and snorted
coke out of their nose
yeah if you laugh Coke out of your nose
and then do a Cova test aren't they
going to get a little Coca-Cola on their
swab it's going to look like a false
positive now wait wait there's more
what if
what if
there's a high correlation
between the people who would drink
a Cola drink
not exactly health food
and the people who would be unhealthy
and have comorbidities unlikely to die
anyway hmm
what if
it's a soda pandemic
uh
huh
what if the false positives are soda in
the nose and the people dying were going
to die sooner than other people anyway
because they have unhealthy diets as
indicated by their soda consumption
now
I don't think any of that's true
but
wouldn't it be easy to start that rumor
none of that's true don't take any of
that seriously okay
but I do Wonder
if it's true that these types of drinks
can cause a false positive are you
telling me that never
that never a person who just had a soda
tested positive with a swab because if
you've got the soda in your mouth
doesn't at least the I don't know the
fumes from the soda get into your nose
or something
no just a question
here's a question
do vaccines work
today there's a uh information that the
people at the Delta infection you can
get the same amount of virus
regardless of vaccination status early
analysis suggests
what do you think of that
now those of you who believe that the
vaccinations are not you know are not
credible
did that did this information agree with
what you already thought
it was pretty convincing wasn't it
because you already thought it was true
if you think that the vaccinations are
sketchy and you don't trust them
you almost certainly believe
that it didn't didn't change the level
of infection for Delta variant
but is it true
well even the people who did the study
say don't believe us
let me say that again
even the people who said who did the
study the people who did the study
say in clear language don't believe this
is true
until it's confirmed because they didn't
do the kind of study that they are
confident you can conclude it would be
reproducible
so the first thing is even the people
who did it don't say you should believe
it all right so should you believe it
well if they say don't believe it
should you
now they do say there's enough of an
indication that it's a real worry
should you be worried
of course
you should be worried
somebody says what about anal swabs that
is a good question because wouldn't that
pick up some Coca-Cola
good question
[Music]
um
so what so listen to the exact language
Delta infections May produce similar
violent virus levels regardless of
vaccination study status
they may produce it what does that tell
you
does that tell you that it's like that
with some people but not with others
and didn't you already know that
did you not already know that some
people
can get a vaccination and get just as
much covet as if they had no vaccination
at all you all knew that right because
for some people for whatever reason the
vaccination just doesn't work you know
they have some weird situation with
their immunity
so is it telling us that everybody has
the same virus level and then it lasts
the same amount of time
we don't know
so we don't know anything because what
if you do have the same virus level but
only during this shorter period and then
it goes away fast
do we know that having the same amount
of virus in you makes you just as uh
transmissible
we don't
because what if you're not coughing
you know what if you're vaccinated so
you're not getting symptoms so you're
just not coughing and you're not
breathing extra hard
which is what happens when your lungs
are degraded
I mean do you think that vaccinated
people transmitted as much don't know
that's worth studying but we do know
that they at some point some of them
might have a lot of virus in them which
I think we already knew but it's being
presented like new information
uh so if you don't get sick
and by the way I think we've all we all
agree that these are not vaccinations in
the classic sense of preventing they're
more like Therapeutics that come in a
needle
which is good
which is good
all right
um
I'm seeing some charts go up on the
locals platform somebody's making an
argument with charts let me tell you uh
what you should believe when somebody
puts a chart on the internet
nothing nothing if somebody gives you a
really convincing chart even with
sources on the internet
what should you say to yourself
you should say I have seen no
information here nothing
because you probably don't know the
context blah blah
all right uh
uh Rasmussen has a poll asking people if
Cuomo should resign Governor Cuomo
because of the report saying he had a
number of Highly credible sexual
improprieties in the workplace
um 73 said he should resign
huh
73 think he should reside
so roughly
25 of the public
thinks that a guy who is a Serial sexual
abuser should keep his job as a leader
of the state
what if I told you about 25 of the
public on every poll
it's not every poll but it's so
consistent it's hilarious 25 percent of
the public and I hope it's a different
25 percent every time
are idiots on every question it's just
so consistent but here's the weird part
77 percent of conservatives think Cuomo
should go but only 69 percent of
moderates and and and 73 percent of
liberals so in other words conservatives
are more me too on this than liberals
or they just don't want a Democrat to be
Governor so of course that's in there
too
um so in this particular case one could
interpret this as conservatives believe
women
and liberals not as much
but of course it's the politics that's
pushing those numbers not not anything
else
uh how many of you know internet user
zubi who is at a do you say hip hop star
or rapper I'm not sure
because I'm not young and I'm not cool I
don't know if I know the right words for
that but many of you follow him he's a
great follower great guy and a lot of
fun very talented talented in a number
of areas he's a classic Talent stack
kind of a guy
that if you looked at any one Talent
you'd say oh that's that's that's good
that's not the best one in the world but
he's got a whole bunch of them
like everything from Fitness to Media to
marketing to music to just a whole bunch
of
so zuby's uh pretty impressive as a
human being but he's got one very uh
provocative belief
I'm gonna dig into it a little bit
which is that the pandemic wasn't a real
pandemic we just we just got too excited
about it and that uh yeah people are
dying but it's closer to a flu level
problem and we should not have changed
the world for it
now
here's the question
can you and and I guess part of this
belief was that the total number of
deaths from kovid are not real that
they're more about comorbidities and
stuff but here's my question
can't we know for sure by just looking
at the excess mobile
excess deaths compared to the trend line
last few years and say well where did
all those people die from it wasn't the
lockdown I mean I don't I don't know too
many people who died from the lockdown
there are more suicides so maybe that
counts more people drinking themselves
death more more opioids so that probably
counts but it doesn't explain all of it
so
here's the most basic question I asked
if you're trying to trust numbers
uh number one well let's give some
context we've seen some reports lately
that covet deaths have been over counted
in hospitals everybody agrees with that
right there's nobody here who thinks
that coved counts are accurate right
nobody believes that but how how
accurate they are is a subjective
dispute
my sense of it is they're probably with
it it's probably 80 accurate which would
give you the same strategies for
everything as if they're 100 accurate
but suppose they were only
10 accurate well then all your policies
would be wrong probably
right
but how do you tell how do you know if
you're 80 accurate or 20 accurate well
one way is to look at the total deaths
because there's no other explanation
for the total deaths
after you've taken out the suicides and
the overdoses the things that clearly
are you know more related to that
lockdown than the than the pandemic
if you if you do that comparison
shouldn't you know for sure
if your coveted estimates are at least
within the ballpark right and have
people done that
well so when I ask that question what do
you think happens
when I ask the question have we compared
coven deaths the way we count them to
the overall mortality and the answer is
you will be sent many graphs on Twitter
if you'd like to know the answer to that
look at my tweet and you'll see that
people have sent you a lot of graphs
now what is The credibility of a graph
on Twitter regardless of the source
zero none
so believe it or not it's the simplest
question in the world or feels like it
it can't be answered because we don't
have any credible sources of anything
it's just all I'm on
now some people said but Scott it has
been studied here's my graph
no
no it hasn't been studied
because if you haven't studied next year
you don't know what the happened
because of next year if deaths are way
down
then you would know that all you did was
you know push some deaths into a prior
Year and that the total number of deaths
maybe is the same as if no pandemic had
happened at all you know if you looked
at two or three years on average
so no we don't know the answer to this
question because we don't know the
future we don't know what the
measurement will be next year and if you
don't know that you don't know what
happened this year it can't be known in
my opinion it can't be known so is zooby
right
that the pandemic is fake and when it's
all said and done we won't see the
excess deaths that could be attributed
to it only excess deaths or mostly
excess deaths I don't want to be an
absolute about somebody else's opinion
but mostly abscess mostly excess deaths
from other means to the lockdown
don't know
we actually don't know
the biggest question in the world
we actually don't know
but I do think
that the data shows that the excess
deaths are are hard to explain any other
way
but we'll know in a year or two
um
why is it that when humans
are you know accused of something we say
they're innocent until proven guilty but
should we say that about an election
it makes sense to say a human is
innocent until proven guilty even when
even when we know that's not true
it's just the way we want to manage the
way we live with each other is that
until it's proven
you're not guilty according to the law
that makes sense but what about an
election
an election is not a person
right you can't hurt his feelings you
can't put in an election in jail
should an election be innocent until
proven guilty
because that's the approach we've taken
we've taken the approach that the 2020
election
had to be fair or at least this is the
main street narrative it had to be fair
because there's no evidence it's it's
guilty
that only makes sense for people
it doesn't make sense for a system
for a system you should look at the
whole situation
and then decide if it's innocent or
guilty
so
here's my take
if you have an election that's designed
in a way
that prevents audits from happening and
I think that's the case our election
seems to be designed in a way that at
least part of it the electronic part is
not auditable in the classic sense so if
you design a system that's not auditable
you know you've done that right during
the design phase you would certainly
know if you had designed it to be
auditable
you have to assume it's fraudulent
don't you doesn't that reverse the
burden of proof
I would say if if a system is designed
so it can't be audited you've also
designed a system that guarantees fraud
you just don't know when
that's the only question
it's guaranteed by the desire because
they're hiding places whenever they're
hiding places Parts you can't audit you
always get fraud you just have to wait
long enough right it doesn't mean it
happened today and it doesn't mean it
happened in 2020. but it'll happen it's
guaranteed it's built into the system
it's literally designed to guarantee
fraud so shouldn't our default
assumption be that it was fraudulent
because remember the election you can't
hurt its feelings it's not a person you
can't put it in jail
you can't give it to you know any legal
rights it's just a system and if a
system is designed to guarantee fraud
that should be your default assumption
even if you're wrong it should be your
starting assumption
all right or to put it more uh cleanly
you get what you design
you get
what you designed
now we designed a system that you can't
check
that's what we've got
all right let's talk about persuasion
again
um it was pointed out Mark Schneider
said this and some other people were
weighing in on this on uh on Twitter
that showing pictures of people getting
the actual needle is anti-persuasive
because there are enough people who have
a needle phobia
that just the the picture of it is such
a turn off that you don't want to get
the vaccination
number one is that true I would say
that's probably true
see that seems you know you have to test
this stuff to really know but you know
with any you don't even have to be
experienced in Persuasion to know this
is true that if you show the scariest
thing and you show it in a visual form
you've made visual a concept
what happens when you make visual
something scary
it gets worse
right it gets worse showing all these
celebrities who are not afraid of the
needle getting a needle is the worst
thing you could do and that's a good
observation and I didn't make it myself
and I'm I'm embarrassed because I should
have seen this
so what should you do instead let's say
you wanted to persuade
stop stop I'm not persuading you because
I don't I don't try to persuade you to
make medical decisions that would be
unethical of me so I don't do it but
talking about persuasion is what I do do
and so we'll talk about it in this
context if you wanted people to get the
vaccination knowing that a lot of them
have needle phobia how would you do it
here's how I do it
I would show somebody who's getting a
vaccination but I would just show them
the face
all right so look at look at me in the
camera if you can see this so if you see
my big old head
and you see me worrying about getting
the shot and then I get the shot and
then I say when are you going to give me
the shot and they say you just got it
and then I go oh I just got it I didn't
feel it
and then you show another one you just
do a compilation clip of just faces of
people saying was that it did I get to
the shot
and you have them looking away because
this is what I do I don't have a needle
phobia but I don't like seeing it either
so I've never looked in the direction of
the person who gives me the shot I sit
on the chair and I go like that I look
to the left or right because I usually
get a shot and the other's arm so I
usually look that way and I just keep
looking that way the entire time because
the last thing I want to say
is the needle
I don't want to see it
no no
do you if you showed people getting open
heart surgery I think fewer people would
get it
you don't want to see it
you want to see the happy face of the
person who recovered from the surgery
so show me faces faces are the most
persuasive so visual
and faces
and you show people being surprised
that they could barely feel it
that's it that's your that's your
persuasion
um if you show enough people it gets the
more you show the more persuasive it
gets
um
here's an interesting thought
getting the coven shot will cure you of
being afraid of needles
because a number of people said this
that for whatever reason the Covenant
shot you barely feel it compared to
other vaccinations you may have
experienced I don't know if it's because
the needle is thinner it doesn't go in
as far or it doesn't catch a vein I
don't know what but if you compared it
to anything like you know having your
blood drawn it's not even close you just
barely feel it
um you'll hardly know it's even
happening so here I would go right at
this and I'd say that getting a coven
shot will fix two problems you'll be
vaccinated
and it will help you with your fear and
needles because you're not even going to
feel this freaking thing
so now is that true we're talking only
about persuasion so it doesn't need to
be true in this context
all right
uh that
is largely what I wanted to talk to you
about today
um
damn news is straight up boring now yeah
yeah did you see the uh
um so Biden was answering a question
about uh Ron DeSantis today
did you see it and somebody said what
about Ron DeSantis yeah I'm paraphrasing
he you know he says he's gonna block
your you know rules whatever your
federal rules
and here was Biden's Biden looks at the
reporter he goes governor who
and he laughs and walks away governor
who
now
it's kind of Genius
it's kind of Genius
Biden's uh strategy of not engaging
sometimes it's just brilliant because
whatever he said would be a headline
right because it's the president versus
the governor and instead of engaging
with it he just blows it off but here's
the best part
when when Biden jokes that he can't
remember something
it starts creating this context
where the next time he can't remember
something legitimately he can joke about
it
he's creating a context in which he can
hide his dementia
it's really clever now is he doing it
intentionally I don't know it could be
but it's having that effect
all right let me
let me pause here I'm seeing it in the
comments a picture of somebody who had a
adverse effect from a vaccination
do we all agree
that there are adverse effects from
vaccinations no nobody says they're not
right
so how many individual examples
would you need to see to convince you
one way or the other that you should get
a shot
well here's the last thing you should do
if you want to be helpful
show people pictures like this of people
who had a bad effect
that's almost Criminal it's almost
criminal if well let me make an
assumption if the vaccinations are good
overall and I'll allow that some of you
are not convinced of that but if the
vaccinations
are as the experts say the only way we
can get past this
then showing an individual picture
because remember pictures are very
persuasive a picture of somebody with a
bad outcome from a vaccination which we
know happens statistically we know this
for sure
it's just the worst thing you can do now
if you're convinced that vaccinations
are definitely worse than not getting
vaccinated
well then you're you're persuading
exactly the way you want to but man you
better you better be right
you know you're I would say that if you
take the risk of showing a picture of
somebody with a bad outcome from
vaccinations you better be right
that vaccinations are worse than not
getting vaccinated because you're taking
that responsibility when when you
persuade that hard because you know most
of us are just chattering on Twitter
right it's not terribly persuasive oh
there's a tweet with some words in it
but as soon as you take that to the next
level and show me the picture of
somebody with a bad outcome and you know
you can really see it
you're you're a doctor
you sort of cross the line
you've crossed the line into making
medical recommendations and you're not a
doctor it's one thing when we talk about
the doctors and we question them and
we're skeptical that's all good
to be skeptical but once you show that
picture of the person with a bad outcome
you're a doctor because you're really
telling people what to do with their
medical situation at that point that's
not just talk so just be careful of it
all right I don't mean to come down on a
subscriber uh Daniel because I know that
you're trying to be useful here and let
people know what the risks are and
that's I appreciate that so that I
believe the intention is all good
no doubt about that I don't question the
intention so good intentions but just be
careful when you go visual
especially like scary visual fear
and visual persuasion of the two
strongest things
so I mean that's what we're just talking
about with the showing people getting
vaccinated it changes Behavior a scary
picture changes Behavior I would argue
that the the video of the of Wuhan with
people collapsing in the streets
had a lot to do with you know Behavior
and that was probably not even true
all right
Dr Johnson says Scott don't want to
upset you or
big Pharma bosses sheep
well Dr Johnson
let me speak to you directly
 you
 you for imagining that I would take
money from Pharma and give people
medical advice based on being paid for
it you and everybody in your family
 you your dog your house
your car your bank account
your stupid ugly head
 everybody you've ever talked to
anybody who likes you you
completely
no I don't take money from Pharma
I don't take any secret money
from anybody you're not aware of right I
take subscriptions
from individuals who would like you know
extra content that's a little too edgy
for the public I definitely do that but
if you imagine that I'm taking money
from anybody
especially Pharma
I hate big Pharma just like most
of you right I think Pharma is largely a
criminal organization that
also does good things
right like the food industry the food
industry is at least the grocery store
industry it's a criminal organization
if you've ever dealt with it they're
just criminals but we also need
food so there's a good side to it
Anne-Marie says Dr Johnson has a PHD in
social work well maybe that's why you're
so stupid Dr Johnson
Dr Johnson you are one of these smart
idiots I keep hearing about
um
like what like why would you even really
think
that I would take money from Pharma to
sell a drug
I can't even think of anything less
ethical than that can you
think of something less ethical than
that I can't
I can't think of anything that would be
worse than it and by the way I'm saying
this so clearly
that my my life would be completely over
if somehow like later information came
out and it always does right you always
get caught if information came out later
that had been paid by somebody to do
something I'd get caught
you know there'd have to be somebody
else who knew about it who'd want to
talk about it later
so no it would be a stupid risk you only
the idiot would do that
and you'd have to be a really unethical
idiot who wants to
just have no credibility whatsoever in
their life so Dr Johnson you and
everybody who looks like you and uh
please never
consume any of my content again
all right
um
you and Bill Gates are buddies
on local somebody's saying no I've never
met Bill Gates I always wanted to but
now it would be too dangerous
I always thought it'd be fun to beat
Bill Gates
at the moment
not the right time
so probably probably won't be following
up on that
um
let's see people trying to reconcile how
they agreed with you on Trump and not on
the vaccines yeah you know
that there's a strange phenomenon
where where people can think that I was
reasonable and smart on on one topic
that's in the news that has you know
same information we're all looking at
right I don't have special information
usually
um
and then I'll be all smart and rational
on that topic and then the very next
topic
like I'll lose my mind and and the only
way you can explain it is that I must be
bought off by a big Pharma company it's
like there's only one way to explain it
do you ever consider the alternative
explanation
that I'm right twice
is that I mean the the people the people
who are sure I was right before but now
I'm wrong do you ever even consider the
possibility that I was just right twice
and then maybe you were wrong
um
some people suffer from a lack of
imagination yeah so that's uh
I often say that if you can't think of
any other reason
for why you see something
that's a lack of imagination it doesn't
mean you've determined that there's only
one possibility
because the possibility is that you're
just wrong
or you're experiencing cognitive
dissonance
or somebody says you're not right about
everything so here's somebody who's
joining us late who is accusing me of
pretending I'm right about everything
when the entire theme of my show
was how wrong I am
see the problems
90 percent are moderate and 10 chasing a
joke I'm not sure I get that
Dr Johnson says we have an intervention
plan for you I'm talking to Christina
about it now
yeah maybe I do need an intervention
uh but Dr Johnson off
uh I don't like you you're not a good
person
and that
is my show for the day let me ask you
something
um I know that you you hate the covid
content
I do too like I really want to talk
about other stuff like politics and
world events and stuff but the news
industry has decided we can only care
about one thing and so there's not much
else to talk about
uh when there is I'll be talking about
it and then things will get back to
normal but my God can this pandemic ever
get over doesn't look like it nor do we
have a strategy to get past it yeah if
there's one thing that bothers me the
most about the way the government is
handling this it's that they're not
telling us the truth
they're not telling us the truth that at
our current rate of vaccinations
we're not going to get there and we have
to just figure out what life looks like
without getting there
so
um that's all for now and I'll talk to
you
tomorrow
