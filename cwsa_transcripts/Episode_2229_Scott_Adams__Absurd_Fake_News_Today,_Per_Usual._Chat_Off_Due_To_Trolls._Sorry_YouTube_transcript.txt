do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization at
least the highlight of human
civilization that also includes coffee
if you'd like to take this experience to
levels that no one has ever even
imagined were possible all you need is a
glass attacker chalices tie the canteen
Joker flaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the parallel pleasure
the dopamine the end of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous it happens now
go
ah well if you're watching on YouTube
you might notice that there are no
comments I've disabled them because
there are too many anti-semites who I
don't even think were organic actually
I believe they were being sent to
destroy our experience
because they didn't they didn't seem
like actual real people but we will not
have to deal with them at the moment if
you were a member of the locals
community
you would uh have an option for comments
but that's subscription only
all right uh let's talk about all the
news
um you may you may detect this kind of
early on
but uh I decided not to sleep last night
do you ever have that has that ever
happen to you
you wake up and it's you know basically
two hours after you went to sleep and
you think you know what
I'm just not feeling sleep
just not feeling it so I just stayed up
so if I fall asleep sometime during this
broadcast you'll know why it has nothing
to do with you it's not personal
uh here's the uh our first item I like
to call backwards science
backwards science
those are studies
that seem to have the causation
backwards don't know for sure but it
looks that way so there's a recent study
in the public library of Sciences it's a
journal and it suggested that for the
Japanese men who are over 40
maintaining sexual interest might be
linked to a longer life
although no no connection was observed
in women
huh
huh
so men over 40 in Japan
who don't have interest in sex
they don't live as long
hmm
what would be something that would cause
you to be uninterested in sex
what would cause that
could it be that you're unhealthy
so here's a study that basically tells
me unhealthy people don't live as long
that's right somebody somebody actually
probably got a grant to study if
unhealthy people live as long as healthy
people
I think that's what it says because
um let me give you a little uh
a little mind Bender you can try at home
ask yourself on any given moment how you
feel
if you're a certain age you've got aches
and pains you've got little maybe a
little congestion and you know maybe you
got a coffee you can't get rid of you
just got a bunch of stuff
and then suddenly you get incredibly
aroused
in some sexual situation
do you notice that all your pain goes
away
big aroused sexually is like the
ultimate painkiller it just makes all
your problems go away simultaneously now
I have a theory which I don't think is
too crazy
that Evolution has granted us with the
ability that if we're in a sexual
situation we just
you know get rid of all of our problems
because it wants us to focus on
reproduction so I feel as though
this is just a hypothesis
that the more often you are aroused
the healthier you will be
so it might also be true that making
yourself aroused if you weren't you know
in the mood might bring some health
benefits
wouldn't surprise me so this this could
be one that works either way the healthy
people have more interest in sex but
also if you
spiked your interest in sex
I do suspect it would make you healthier
because it would release all the the
feel-good chemicals why wouldn't it it
would be more surprising if it didn't
all right uh commonly Harris there's a
video of her I don't believe it was a
new video so it didn't happen this week
but in the past she had compared 9 11 to
January 6th
now
we're also going to talk about the
accusations about Musk
for those of you who are following the
news and especially social media
does it feel as if
we're not we but does it feel as if the
bad guys are prepping to murder musk and
Trump
I feel like there's a narrative that's
being created that they're actually
traitors
and what's the penalty for a Trader
it's death
and there it's very conscious and you
can see all The Usual Suspects you know
forming around the narrative and
honestly to me it looks like they're
going to kill them
like actually literally it looks like
they're planning to kill them
now
I said before that
you know that that's the sort of thing
that nobody could get away with if the
public were informed and you know
understood the news and stuff like that
but we are so far from that
we live in a world where a half of the
world would cheer if somebody got
murdered on the other side
half of the country would secretly say
ooh good
the in a real really I mean half of the
country would say that was good
so
yeah I'm really worried about the uh
the safety of both Trump and musk at
this point because what we've seen is
there doesn't seem to be a limit
to what the Democrats will do I mean
they did run
the entire
operations Ops
to put Trump in jail that was real
you know the whole Russian collusion
thing
was just a big coordinated op by the
Democrats and the the reasonable outcome
of that could have been
Trump being jailed or killed or
something
so it does look like that's in play
and when you see Kamala Harris I mean
this was an older video but the the
intention is the same comparing January
6 to things that were actually attacks
on the country
is amazing now I continue to use my
technique and others have adopted it
I've instead of arguing with Democrats
who don't have access to the news
and that's the problem with their
opinion they they actually don't know
what's happened
so they can't speak to any context
because they don't see it their news
sources only give them narrative
now that's true of all news sources
they're all narrative but at least if
you've surveyed both sides you're likely
to get some information that you
wouldn't get from any one side
so
I just expressed sympathy for Democrats
now at least online
when they say things that are so
uninformed that the only possibility is
that their news sources are abusing them
so to me they look like victims at this
point just victims of news abuse
so let's talk about some more stuff uh
let's see uh
so California's got a little problem and
Gavin Newsom in particular
because he uh at first said he was going
to appoint a black woman
to replace Feinstein if she bowed out
early
but now he's he might have to back that
up we're back out of that because Adam
Schiff wants to have that job and as you
know Adam Schiff is one of their
designated Liars
so the Democrats need to have some
designated Liars in office
because it it gives them some comfort
because if you're a regular Democrat you
don't want to have to go on TV and say
insanely ridiculous lies you need small
well and shift to do that you know your
fill bumps and that type of person so
they need they need a shift to be in
office but this was not well received by
representative Barbara Lee who
apparently wants that job and would be
sort of an obvious an obvious one if
Newsom stuck to
um
picking a qualified black woman
she'd be high on the list
but she's mad because it looks like he
might go back on his uh
pointy a black woman promise
and he said and she said representative
Lee said that this new plan is insulting
to countless black women
so it's insulting
to black women that Adam Schiff would be
appointed
how are the Democrats lasted as long as
they have without being eaten to death
on the inside
don't you think every single decision
that Democrats make goes to this big
grinder of of your your racist you're
discriminating you're You're Something
how in the world
as Gavin Newsom survived in that party
I mean you must have blackmail in
somebody because he's the opposite of
everything they want
so anyway good luck there
Governor Newsom because whatever you do
is going to be a disaster you got two
disaster choices
um Rasmussen did a poll asking people
about term limits you would not be
surprised that 70 or something wanted
term limits but How likely do you think
it is that Congress which would have to
make the decision How likely is it the
Congress would vote to limit their own
careers
so how many voters think that
Congress would be dumb enough
to get together by a big majority and
vote away their own benefits the benefit
of staying in office and getting money
wow your guesses are very good very good
it's 23 percent
23 I don't know how you guessed so well
but that was that was impressive most of
you guessed 25 and that was within the
margin of error within the margin of
error
here's a little uh interesting factoid
do you remember after the 2020 election
was questioned
and there were a number of lawsuits or
legal actions taken but some number of
them were rejected by the courts
because the people who were petitioning
the court did not have legal standing
now I'm no lawyer but legal standing
generally means that you were injured or
that you had some effect by the issue
that you're trying to take to the court
you can't be just an observer you have
to be somebody affected by the thing
you're taking to court otherwise you
would have no as I would say standing
well apparently that question because
there was there were some things in the
Fulton County that were taken to the
course and the court said you do not
have standing and then the Supreme Court
said
uh can you explain to us why a voter
doesn't have a standing to find out if
their vote was counted
um how does that make sense the voters
themselves were of course the victim
class so of course the voters could
bring It Forward because of course
they're the ones who were saying they
were victimized of course
so
whatever that case was from back in 2020
is live again
so will it uh will it turn up any
problems
well I don't know if it'll turn up any
problems but I know it was turned down
for an illegitimate reason according to
the Supreme Court
so could we be looking at a trump third
Act
or some some information comes to light
that none of us were expecting
just in time for the election
God it just feels like everything is
moving in that direction
I I feel like the universe just
absolutely wants this to happen
and again I'll say I've seen no evidence
of this alleged election misdeeds no
evidence that I know is is uh is real
uh but as I've said many times wouldn't
it be a miracle
if every institution in our country is
corrupt and we know it except for all
those 50 elections in 50 different
states and each Precinct within the
states those are all good
but 100 of everything else that has that
nature it's important and there are lots
of people involved and if they could
cheat if they would
whatever that's true there's always
seeing you just don't know if it's
happened yet but it's guaranteed by the
design
so that's the only thing we know for
sure maybe we'll find out something
interesting
here's the most surprising story also
about California
uh that there was near there was a
unanimous agreement in the assembly on a
bill that would make child sex
trafficking in California
a more serious felony to keep a repeat
offenders in prison longer
79-0
said yes to longer prison sentences for
repeat
s
are you surprised by that I'm totally
surprised
because I would expect in California
that the the pedos would win in court
every time
for whatever reason
whatever reason but uh maybe maybe
California is
regaining some sanity or something
I don't know what's going on here
um
well we got that one right
maybe it's a trend who knows
well as you know Walter Isaacson famous
biographer wrote the biography of musk
and there was uh there was one little
there was one little error in it there
might be more but one thing we know
about just a small error tiny error the
tiny error
was that uh
he reported that Elon Musk
refused to
um
that he turned off the the Skylink that
would have been used for a Ukrainian
attack on the Russian naval
facilities around Crimea
but it turns out that never happened
instead they were never turned on and
when he the ukrainians didn't know that
they didn't have coverage they thought
they had coverage so they started their
attack only to find out that it wouldn't
work because they didn't have coverage
and when they asked musk for coverage
and he realized that it was sort of a
Pearl Harbor thing they were doing they
didn't want to be part of starting World
War III
now
if you get this story wrong in the
biography as Isaacson admits he got
wrong so he says he got that wrong
that tiny little mistake in the
biography
would be enough to put musk in jail
because apparently you know Elizabeth
Warren and others are believing the
version that they probably heard first
which would make musk look like a bad
guy
but even when corrected now knowing that
it was never there in the first place
and he didn't want to start World War
III they still have an issue
because you know the facts are not too
important they're still going to make an
issue out of it
so this little error
if it had never been mentioned in the
biography would never even be a story
and the Congress would certainly not be
interested in acting on it it just
nobody would even know about it but
because it was reported incorrectly
even once it's corrected it's it's still
stuck in their heads and they're still
going to do something about it even
though they know the original story was
wrong
and the corrected story in my opinion
makes him just look like a patriot or
something
so they absolutely didn't care about the
truth of it it was just an opening and
this is the sort of thing that makes it
look like
um musk and Trump are both just being
targeted by every possible tool of the
government the weaponized government and
it's exactly what it looks like
is exactly what it looks like two two
people being targeted for political
purposes do you know who else thinks
Trump is being targeted
for political purposes
Putin Putin was just at some event where
he was asked about things and he said
that he thought Trump is being
prosecuted for political reasons
even Putin can see it now of course
Putin would prefer one assumes
Trump to be in office because Trump
would probably get things settled pretty
quickly and uh even I think even Putin
admits it that he could get assembled
pretty quickly
so
we'll keep an eye on that but uh
I've been asked a number of times by
people who wanted to write my biography
do you know what I say
do people who want to write my biography
no I'd rather stay out of jail
never let somebody write your biography
never
and if they do don't cooperate
because if you cooperate it's going to
look like it's true
you got to say no this was some crook I
you know some grifter I didn't even want
to be participating in it don't believe
anything that grifter says that's what
you want because nobody's going to write
a biography without putting fake stuff
I don't think it even happens really it
may not be intentional but all news all
news about public figures is fake in
important ways
now what could be more important than
this
you know this story about musk and
Skylake that's about as important a
story as you can have
and that was wrong
the most important story was just wrong
well you can see that the Democrats have
decided to make it a thing
the whole musk not not turning on the
skynest Scott what is it called Skylink
Skylink
starlink what's it called starlink
yeah I keep of course I'm confusing it
with a movie all right
so Jake Tapper
um
was grilling uh Anthony Anthony blinken
about whether this musk stuff
should be addressed and there should be
some penalty for it
so Jake Tapper is sort of pushing the
idea
that of course most should be punished
for there should be some punishment for
not turning on the Skylink
now blinken was not going to fall for it
at all but then we saw
you know MSNBC took the same tact
Etc so you see CNN and Ms MSNBC line up
on the same narrative
almost certainly it came from some
democrat Source or they just knew to do
it because it's obvious it's one of
those two things but it's coordinated in
the sense that they all know what
they're doing and I don't think that
they think it's news I think that they
know it's
um political
um
but uh I want to give you a tell for
propaganda
if you watch uh Jake Tapper he has a he
has a physical tell
for when he's pushing propaganda versus
what he's doing the news and
I want you to look for it because it's
funny
when he's when he's just telling you
something that's true
he looks like I look now he's just
looking straight at the camera
and he says things are true there's a
hurricane you know the budget got passed
that sort of thing but when he goes into
narrative
he tries to sell with his face and his
body
the real message while the person is
talking and you're forgetting what
they're saying at the same time
so when he asked Anthony blinken whether
musk should be punished and and blinken
wasn't going to buy into that narrative
he was just going to say that starlink
is useful
yeah you you watch uh Jake and his head
starts to turn to the side like this
and then he takes on the impression the
physical expression that is the real
story the real story is
the disappointment in my face
am I say my my head is way over here
when I listen to you
disappointment in my face
so look for that
uh if if you look for any Jake Tapper
interview as soon as he starts with with
the parts that are pure you
know the narrative part his he can't
keep his head straight
it just goes over the side like that so
let's look for that because it's kind of
funny
all right
um
so uh yeah you've been Putin likes Trump
here's a question for you according to a
little study uh people were asked to
look at chat GPT AI versus human writing
and apparently the professional
Linguistics people who looked at the
writing were largely unsuccessful in
identifying AI versus human writing with
an overall positive identification rate
of only 39 percent
so sixty percent of the time they were
wrong and
you know they only got it right way less
than half
but I would like to add this to it it
depends entirely what the form of the
writing is
if they try if AI tried to write humor
you could tell right away
that it was either the worst human
writer or AI
what it's good at is boring things
so if you say uh AI can you describe the
separation of powers in the United
States
you know that would just be boring
writing it probably does that as well as
any historian would do
yeah if it if you asked it to write
erotica or sarcasm or humor
um or even a review probably probably
would even do good and do well on a
review or something but anything that's
more opiniony
it's not going to come close
that's that's my take
but for all the boring stuff yeah it'll
do the boring stuff just fine it'll look
like a human
because the human would have written a
boring too
um so I make sure image tweet that
struck a chord so he's been out and
about and you know talking to people and
he's finding a pattern
he said I've yet to meet a person who
had all of the facts but still hated
Trump
I'm certain such a person exists that's
human diversity of thought but man
within 30 seconds every Trump opposer
immediately tells you a hoax
that's exactly my experience
I don't believe there's an anti-charm
person
who is now operating under the belief
that the hoaxes are real
has anybody experienced it I've never
experienced somebody who knew the hoaxes
were fake
and also dislike them I've never seen it
they all believe that the you know the
the mocking the disabled guy with the
the bad arm really happened
they think that he recommended injecting
bleach they think that actually happened
yeah they think the fine people hoax was
real
the the whole the whole thing and they
also still believe that he was actually
guilty of Russian collusion
they actually believe that they believe
that whole process went through and
showed that he was in fact
colluding with Russia the the opposite
of what happened
yeah
so I wouldn't call it a mass Hysteria
I mean it's just it's proper
brainwashing
there's a hysteria that comes from
believing that stuff but the reason they
believe it is not the hysteria the
reason they believe it is just
brainwashing and then the brainwashing
leads to the hysteria the hysteria does
not cause the belief the belief causes
the hysteria so get that right
yeah it's motivated reasoning you're
right it's people who talk themselves
into it I think
all right
um You probably saw the news that a
bunch of activists are occupied speaker
McCarthy's office
uh and they were demanding
um reauthorization of some act that they
cared about doesn't matter to the story
but what was the difference between
these people occupying McCarthy's office
without permission
and an insurrection January 6 wandering
around the capitol now again of course
we're not talking about the people who
did violence they were all bad but
looks a lot the same doesn't it yeah the
big difference is Democrats apparently
can do it Republicans cannot and it's a
pretty obvious double standard
uh Nancy mace has been making the rounds
this weekend and today on on the media
Outlets making some noise she's always a
lot of fun because she's very outspoken
um
but she says that bribery is grounds for
impeachment and she has seen a whole
bunch of
documents about the Biden's Financial
transactions that the public has not
seen
and she's seen enough that we have not
seen
that she thinks a
an impeachment inquiry is warranted
so then Caitlyn Collins
was Caitlin what's her last name on CNN
Caitlyn
Collins
yeah because they're they they have a
Stefan
he's not related no she's not related
right
all right so uh Caitlin Collins
um
uh she was uh she was not too interested
in what Nancy mace saw imagine Nancy
mace comes on your show it's just the
two of you in an interview
and she says I have personally saved all
this you know sketchy Financial stuff
that the public has not seen CNN has not
seen
and it looks totally like there's a
bribery going on and we should you know
get more bank records and find out and
as Glenn Greenwald pointed out he used a
a statement that I love
um
he said the media generally seemed
aggressively uninterested
in knowing more about Biden's Financial
transactions regarding Ukraine
and I thought that was just that is
exactly what we see they are
aggressively uninterested
remember I I've been yakking about the
fact that the firing of shoken
you know they claimed they had all this
international support
but still nobody's looking into finding
even one name of one person who
supported it just one like with a real
name
that now that is aggressively
uninterested
you can't get more uninterested in the
story
than not even asking the people who were
named as the main sources whether it's
true that that's aggressively
uninterested
so Greenwald is right on it
um when I tweeted the the story about
um Gavin Newsom is trying to figure out
whether he wants to support Adam Schiff
or you know Barbara Lee for that
position as Senator uh
I I
cheekily tweeted it and said it's hard
to tell who the worst person is in this
story is is it Newsome for making the
promise and then changing his mind or
even considering that race would be the
main requirement or is it Barbara Lee
who says all black women are going to be
offended because it's about race or is
it Adam Schiff who's the worst person in
the world typically and at Greenwald
actually replied to me and he goes it's
always Adam Schiff
it's just always Adam Schiff if you're
asking who's the worst person in the
story and Adam Schiff is in the story
it's happening chef
as soon as you said that I thought yeah
that's that's about right it's always
Adam
all right so there's a story where Joe
Biden apparently is going to release six
billion dollars of Iran's money
so that they'll have access to it in
return for uh getting back five hostages
and Trump is basically saying that's the
worst idea in the world because he got
hostages back without giving any money
but if you if you allow them to
Blackmail you to get your hostages back
do you suspect there might be more
hostages in the future
do you suspect he's creating a big old
incentive system for more hostage taking
which Trump is accurately calling out as
bad crazy
yes
have you noticed the correlation the
pattern
that Democrats
really really like things
that obviously create the wrong
incentive
but it sounds good when you first say it
you know things that sound good at the
moment but clearly you know it sounds
good to get your hostages back hey that
sounds good
but they're not really thinking this
through
not not thinking it through at all
yeah as soon as you make the business
model work
of kidnapping get you money
that's what Biden Danny just made the he
made their business model successful
of course there will be more maybe not
from Iran but of course there will be
more because they saw it work
yeah that's like a zero Dimension chess
he's playing right there
well there's a report that China has got
a big shake-up in their military
industrial
Arena so there are let's see one two
three four major uh heads you know
chairman types of uh big military
industrial businesses and I guess
they're being purged
presumably for corruption I don't know
what else it would be but
um when you see this
it doesn't make me think that China is
ready for war
I believe that China will not attack
Taiwan
um
at least until the election
so there's no way they're going to do it
before the election and here's why
because there are at least two
candidates who would go hard on them
but possibly if they give somebody who's
a president of the United States who's
sort of soft on Taiwan you know they
might have a different situation but you
know as long as you've got uh the vague
in the race and he's saying that you
know it's a red line you know until we
get our chips up and working in this
country it would only make sense for
China to wait
because if there's one prominent person
saying hey we're going to be serious
about protecting Taiwan
um until we get our chips and then we'll
reassess it would be crazy
for China to move militarily when they
could just wait seven years or whatever
it takes to get our chips back and then
you know make a stronger push
yeah China's got a lot of patience it is
a strategic asset that is correct
all right so maybe China's falling apart
in 10 different ways or demographics are
bad and their their real estate
situation is imploding and they're
manufacturing is being moved out and
it's full of corruption and there are
too many men compared to women and uh
but probably they'll be fine
she lived in a forum in the Midwest for
a year is that true
president XI lived in the United States
for a year
that's really true
not here oh not here
in Iowa
but not a year well that's interesting
huh you'd think he would speak better
English
but I don't think he tries does he
oh he can he just doesn't do it
in private yeah that makes sense
all right well
that's all that's going on today I got
up early and
still came up short because the news is
very interesting
have you heard anything from the Apple
announcement yet is anybody double
screening
to find out if anything anything got
announced
um I will tell you my current situation
I sold
um
oh apples
Pacific time and I'm not East okay I got
the time zones wrong
sounds like a oh that's funny I always
have it backwards but Apple's on my time
all right so here's what
I expect
I think Apple has you know trouble in
the long term I sold my Apple stock so
full disclosure I don't own Apple stock
at the moment except in in Index Fund
um so I guess I own a lot of it because
it's a big part of the index fund
but I've got a feeling the phones are
going to be underwhelming
uh but are these the phones that go to
the USBC different charger device
I feel like I might get one just for the
better charger device
not better but just so I could have one
type so right now I've got too many
types of chargers and going to a single
charger for all my devices
would be such a big Improvement to my
life that I might want to spend you know
the cost of a phone
just for that
so that's that's a bullish thought a lot
of people are going to say the same
thing
um
here's a product that I think Apple
should make
because it is so Apple
they should make it an iPad
that's optimized for podcasts
meaning producing them so right now the
back camera is better than the forward
camera right on an iPad
I'm right about that right
so ideally you'd want the back camera so
you can see yourself like I am right now
you'd want the back camera to be at
least as good
for podcasting but you would also want
some software
that would allow you to broadcast to you
know all the platforms at the same time
so I would love to see apple
make an iPad that's the ultimate
podcasters tool
so now there wouldn't maybe there
wouldn't be that many sales of it but I
feel like everybody's going to be a
podcaster eventually
you know even if it's just calling to
friends
Adam Curry has a good setup
scuzzy interface all right
uh they can Market it for narcissists
all right the majority of pictures taken
on mobile or selfies yeah exactly how
many if you looked at most of your
pictures on your phone
how many of them are back camera versus
four camera
it's mostly back camera right
yeah
yeah and pictures of your dogs even when
I take a picture of my dog it's usually
a selfie with a dog
yeah yours are all non-selfies all right
well that's my predict my suggestion for
Apple
