hey everybody
come on in it's time yeah
it's time for coffee with scott adams is
it still the best time of the day
yeah yep every single time
some of you are prepared i know you are
and if you're really prepared what do
you have with you
well you probably have a cup of mug or
glass maybe a tanker jealous or steiner
canteen sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
even if you have a tiny little hotel cup
still going to be awesome go
so i'm in tahiti at the moment
which is a stopover from bora bora
it's the big island you go to for your
main flights
back home but i also have to get a
corona virus covet test this morning
before i can fly
so am i concerned that i can get a kova
test
in tahiti and actually get a result
before i get on my plane
i'm a little concerned about that yes i
am
but the worst case scenario is i have to
stay in t for another day
so wouldn't be the worst thing um
let's talk about all the news
are you ready got lots of it got lots of
good stuff
it's a it's a fun news day and i'm going
to start a new segment
i'm going to call the fake news news
it's news
about the fake news because the fake
news has covered the
fake news i don't need to cover that
i'll just cover
the fake news is news for example
uh apparently there's a gentleman who's
been
arrested uh i don't know if he's been
arrested if he's being charged
or something as an array an iranian
agent
who apparently has contributed opinion
pieces to the new york times
that's right an unregistered agent of
iran
has written opinion pieces in the new
york times now
do you say to yourself uh new york times
how can they be so whatever they are to
allow some
unregistered agent of a foreign country
to get
you know get through and be putting
opinion bases in their
in their in their publication
i have a feeling that this is so
common that probably almost every
news organization has been at least a
little bit
touched by this sort of thing i feel as
if
you know china and iran and russia etc
they probably all have journalists don't
you think
you know either directly or by influence
or
people who lean their direction just get
the kind of
right kind of jobs and they become
they become the writers so i don't know
that this is unusual
i would expect that iran and lots of
other countries would have
people they influence who in turn
influence you and you wouldn't
necessarily know about it
until one of them gets caught and it's a
and it's a headline
so unfortunately i think this is more
normal than not normal
and when you're reading your fake news
one of the questions you could ask
yourself is this
hey is that article being written by an
enemy of my country
you don't know you just don't know but
you have to at least
at least consider the possibility that
the person writing the
the article is literally the enemy of
your country
that's a real thing and it's common
enough i think
that you should sort of have that little
program running in the back your head
hey is this a real opinion or is this an
enemy of my country
here's some more fake news news about
fake news
so john kerry was uh asked about uh
i i can't think of john kerry without
thinking of a tree
he reminds me of an old growth tree
so much that that's all i say i've told
you before that
i can't see people the same way if i
ever see their animal
because most people look like some kind
of animal you don't realize it until
till the idea occurs to you and like uh
that person looks a little bit like a
i don't know a horse i think and then
you can never see anything else except
that person looks like a horse
well john kerry i just see a tree
and so that's all i can see when i when
i see a talking tree
and by the way i'm sure there's i'm sure
there's something that i remind you of
this
yeah groot i am groot
um so he was saying in response to the
question about
uh people in the oil industry who might
lose their jobs
pretty big deal right well the energy
business in this country is a giant
industry
critical for national success and
if we go green and try to keep the oil
in the ground as they say
and the gas in the ground i suppose
it's a big deal and it could have big
employment
impacts so what did john kerry say about
the people who would lose their jobs
if the oil industry gets squeezed
he said quote what president biden wants
to do is make sure that those folks
have better choices that they can be the
people to go work to make solar panels
what did he really say that in public
john kerry really said that the people
in the energy business
would lose their jobs they can go make
solar panels
there are a few problems with that
number one
when when does that solar panel make it
kick in
same day they lose their job or would it
take years to build an industry they
could employ as many people as
have been lost to it could you have
an american solar panel manufacturing
industry
that would ever be price competitive
with making them overseas
there's a reason it's made overseas we
don't know how to do it
we don't know how to do it inexpensively
compared to
where they where it could be done
somewhere else so is there going to be a
domestic
solar panel industry when
they can't possibly make them
in a way that they can make a profit now
maybe and i'd like to think this is true
automation will make it possible to do
that
and be competitive with with china
because if china needs robots to make
stuff and we need robots to make stuff
it ends up being about the same price
it's only when people are making stuff
that they get the they get the big
advantage
so maybe we can make uh solar panels
cheaply enough but if we make them with
robots
that's also not labor right
the only way we can compete on price and
that's the only way
the green new deal energy stuff will
work is if it's
economically competitive only way you
can do it is without labor
i think you know just economically it
makes sense i don't know how you can do
it
with labor when our labor is more
expensive than other countries
so that's the first problem there's a
timing problem at
but it's not really the same people
that's the problem
do you think that the oil industry
people who get
fired are living in the place where the
solar
the solar factory will be do you think
the people in pennsylvania will say
if they lose their job do you think
they're going to say oh good
pack up the car we're going to go live
in i don't know
sunny someplace else and make solar
panels
well some will but here's the thing that
makes it
fake news and i'm sure that cnn for
example will never say what i'm saying
that is that it is true
that they might create new jobs with
this green technology
at the same time it's true that there
will be jobs lost in the
more traditional older energy companies
but what he's not telling you is that
the people who get the new jobs
will be different people that feels
really important to the story right
hey a million people will lose their job
but don't worry there will be a million
new jobs
four other people the people who are
going to lose their jobs still have a
problem
that you know unless that solar panel
factory springs up the same day they
lose their job and
they have the right kind of skills and
it pays pays the right amount of money
i mean there is a lot of ifs in this
idea and so what makes it a fake news
is that leadership is all about
tough choices right now is it a
correct but tough choice to move the
economy toward a
more of a green green industry
hard to know hard to know in the long
run
of course we need to get there but it's
a question of timing
and you know do you do it do you do it
economically or do you rush
et cetera so there are very smart people
um i think mark cuban would be an
example of a very smart person who would
say that the
green new technologies are are really
good they're going to be
good for the economy good for jobs etc
i hope i'm characterizing his opinion
correctly that the
green new energy business could be quite
a hopping thing
but if it's different people
and it doesn't happen at the same time
shouldn't you tell the public that
shouldn't that be one of the things you
say look public
i know this isn't going to be easy but
we have these reasons we want to do this
we think it's good in the long run for
the country
but it's going to take some sacrifice by
this group
this other group will get the benefits
they'll get jobs over here
and this state this state will lose jobs
and
nothing's going to happen for you you're
just going to lose jobs
but this other state will do great
because they're going to build some
build some
green factories that would be honest
honest leadership would be
it's going to hurt but some other people
will do better and on average that's
where we need to be as a country in the
long run
so there's just no way around it that
would be leadership
but they can't say that because they
don't want to lose a state
so they have to lie lie and say that
those people losing jobs i'll just get
other jobs
all right you're all watching the the
news about gamestop right
uh how many of you understand that story
so the the basic story that a bunch of
individuals
on reddit got together and
decided to massively collectively buy
stock
in this one company called gamestop
now this is having the effect of
uh being a as
you can see in the comments there's uh
lots of yeses and lots of yeses
wow i'm actually quite kind of impressed
at the
quality of this audience and i mean that
i don't know how many general audiences
would have so many people i'm looking at
the comments and
most of you say you understand
understand that story
it's kind of impressive actually jesus
look at look at the
look at the number of people in the
comments who say they actually
understand that story it's a complicated
story i thought i was gonna have to
explain it to you
wow wow i think some of the smartest
people
in the internet are on this uh
or on this live stream now
this is amazing i'm really very
impressed i suppose it's the people who
understand it we're
going to comment but but even still i'm
so i'm surprised
but let me give you the basic idea for
if anybody doesn't know how this works
so there are big companies called hedge
funds who
try to make money by driving down the
price of a stock
this is not good for the company that
owns that stock because people are just
playing manipulating their stock
the way they would do that is they would
buy a contract if you will
that says they will make money if the
stock goes down
now if you see that a bunch of smart
investors with a lot of money
have just made big bets that a stock
will go down
what are you going to do if all the
smart people just made giant bets the
stock is going to go down
and you own that stock you want to get
the hell out of there
right because it's going down not only
are they
telling you it's going to go down but
they make it to go down
that's that's the manipulative part
right there might be some stories that
come out about some bad things happening
at the company they may be true they may
be
more opinion you don't know but the big
hedge funds have the power to drive down
the price of a stock
which does nothing for you does nothing
for the company
now in some cases they would argue that
they're just adding efficiency
and they're they're driving down the
price of a stock that
deserves to be driven down in other
words they're not destroying good
companies they're destroying companies
that have some issues
but keep in mind they've gone after
tesla
imagine if they drew they had driven
tesla and a business
that was a possibility i think i don't
know if they had that much power but
they did try to
drive them the price of tesla at one
point which makes uh elon
musk not their friends
let me just say that elon musk is
enjoying watching the short sellers
get taken at least that's the reporting
so here's how it works if i can explain
this easily
um if you let's say you own some stock
in
a company called gamestop and i can go
to you
and i can say hey i would like to borrow
your stock
for x amount of time specific amount of
time and at the end of that i will give
you your stock back
and you would say why would i let you
borrow my stock
why the hell would i do that and there
are two reasons one
is i'll give you a fee for borrowing it
you could think of it like interest but
it's not it's like a fee for borrowing
it for a while
and so you'd say okay i get a fee
but what about when you give it back to
me
that stock might not be worth the same
amount i'll give you 100 shares
and when you give 100 shares back to me
are they still worth something
because the stock went down in the
meantime
i got a little fee and that's cool but
when you gave me my stock back it wasn't
worth anything
it went down to you know a dollar or
something
so you would have lost as the person who
let me borrow your stock you would be a
loser in that case
why would you do it then why would you
ever let me borrow your stock
well the only reason you do it is that
you think the stock is going to go up
so you think that when i give that stock
back to you it'll be worth more than
when you got when you
when it was first borrowed and enough
more that you come out ahead
not only did i get a fee for letting you
borrow it but when you gave it back
it was worth more than i gave it to you
good deal right
so you always have to have somebody who
thinks something's going up and somebody
who thinks it's going down
to make a trade one of them is right and
one of them's wrong that's how the stock
market works but you need somebody on
both sides right
so that's why somebody would lend you
stock they think it's going in the other
direction
so let's say you're you're a hedge fund
and you've you've done one of these
deals and you say
i'm going to give this stock back to
this guy it's just 100 shares of stock
but the people that read it get together
they say we don't have a lot of money
individually we're just people but if we
all get together
and buy this stock like crazy the hedge
funds
don't have a choice later of buying the
stock at your higher price
and therefore you make a profit because
there they have a contract
that says on this specific date i have
to go get stock that i've already sold
by the way
i borrowed your stock but as soon as i
borrowed it
i sold it so as soon as you lend your
stock to me
you don't have it anymore but neither do
i
i borrowed it and sold it all i have is
cash
so at the end of that contract period
all i have is cash but i owe you a stock
you know you've got to get your 100
shares back so i have to go buy those at
the
in the market but the reddit people
drove up the price
now i can't afford to buy them i don't
have enough money
i can't get enough money there's nothing
i can do
but i owe this gigantic amount of money
because the redditors
drove up the stock price how do i give
you back the money
the shares i borrowed i can't afford
them so i go on a business
so you i go bankrupt at least maybe not
out of business ultimately
but uh so the redditors are
intentionally driving out of business
the hedge funds because they did the
math or somebody did
and figured that they could buy enough
collectively
to actually bankrupt gigantic hedge
funds
which they don't really feel are
so good for the country and
it's this massive shift in power
because the the retail small investors
found out
hey if we band together and use these
communication tools
we can be as powerful or more powerful
than the hedge funds
and we can just drive them out of
business and make a profit too
now if you're listening to this and say
to yourself
hey i think i just found a way to make
some easy money
i'm going to buy me some gamestop stuff
and that stuff's going to keep on going
up and i'll just make a quick
quick profit a lot of people did that
a lot of people got in low probably
sold high made a ton of money with
almost no
time going by but
don't assume that because it happened to
you there should be in the long run
about as many losers as winners right
because it always has to be a buyer
always has to be a seller otherwise
there's no transaction so in the long
run you're going to get
i don't think this is exactly true but
something closer to as many winners as
losers
so if you want to flip a coin and bet
your entire
uh net worth on it i would advise
against it
sort of a coin flip it's not it's not a
guaranteed it's not
it's not safe and if the coin flip
doesn't go your way
it's not that you didn't make money
let's say you lost it all
right you just lost it so super risky
if you're trying to figure out how risky
it is super risky
but if you have lots of people putting
in small amounts that wouldn't make a
difference to their life if they lost
them
you know hundreds of thousands of people
putting in a thousand dollars a piece
say
wouldn't change their life if they lost
them so
i think this is really it's not a
question of what's right or wrong
good or bad we do see that the robin
hood app
apparently stopped letting people buy
the stock
they can sell it but not buy it which is
good for the hedge funds but not good
for the retail people
so let's see how much power the hedge
funds have
because hedge funds are still trying to
still trying to uh
you know manipulate it in their
direction so it's a battle of wills at
the moment we don't know which way it's
going to end
but it's an interesting story and
apparently it shows some hatred for the
big money people
that is bubbling into the you know
bubbling up from the public
in a way that we've never seen before
all right um i'm still getting
uh still getting weird comments about my
tweet
in which i asked if it's too late to
impeach george washington for slavery
and i'm watching a technique by the the
fake news
industry uh to marginalize me
as as a public commenter because i don't
comment
exactly the way they would like and and
i've seen the technique before
so here's the technique and it this is
how
trump uh trump was the victim of this
once and now
uh it's happening to me in a smaller way
do you remember when trump made his
john mccain statement uh
they were talking about john mccain
being a hero and
i think it was when trump was running
for office and he said
i prefer people who don't get caught now
if you don't know that was a joke
then it looks very disrespectful to
anybody who's
uh served but if you do know it's a joke
well it's not really disrespect
respectful it's just a joke
all right and it was a funny joke and
they
stop everything stop everything hold on
hold on
i just had to show you what it looks
like out my window right now
that's crazy take a look at that if
you're listening on podcast
i'll i'll get back to our schedule
program
but the uh the scenery here is just a
joke
this it's just crazy all right
back to john mccain i know that's what
you really want to talk about
so what the what the fake media does
is they they will misinterpret somebody
say trump and then i'm going to tell you
how they do it to me they'll start by
misinterpreting something that was
clearly a joke
and they turned it into oh it's a
disrespectful thing
if they repeat their their
misinterpretation enough
the misinterpretation becomes the truth
at least in terms of the public
and the public says oh yeah it wasn't a
joke it was being
disrespectful so once they've they've
sold you on the fake news that that
trump was being disrespectful to
service people which is of course not
what was happening he was just
mocking mccain um
then that becomes the truth and then
they mock you for it and then the
mocking
is of the thing that never happened
right so the thing that trump would be
mocked for
is the thing that didn't happen likewise
when i did my tweet about
uh you know maybe we should think about
impeaching george washington
the first thing they do is misinterpret
it as not a joke
that's a joke it's a joke
do you think that i really want to
impeach george washington
no now the second thing they do
is even if they recognize it as a joke
they
you know even a joke has a political
point to it and this one does
now the point i'm making is that it
would be
a complete waste of the public's time
and the government's time
to impeach trump because he's not going
to run for office again
if you think he if you think that's
going to happen or at least
if he ran he wouldn't he wouldn't have a
chance of winning at this point
if you're worried about it that's kind
of tds
because trump wouldn't have enough
support from republicans
to win again right and you need at least
your own team
you can't win without your own team and
he would he would have lots of support
but not enough
so i think trump would know
somebody still thinks he would win he
wouldn't win
you wouldn't have any chance if he ran
again i understand that you think
you think that's not the case but
my point which is my opinion
is he has the same odds of winning and
being in office again
as george washington meaning none right
so my point is it's a waste of time
because neither of them will
ever be you know president again but
instead of that
obvious point which i thought was
obvious when i made it
the uh the democrats who are criticizing
me
have decided to interpret it as me not
understanding
that the issue of slavery was very
different
from the issue of inciting people to do
whatever they claim trump did in the
capital
now that's the case of not understanding
how analogies and jokes work
or at least not understand the point in
this case but since
they can repeat that forever forever now
if if i do something else that they
don't like
they will say and he thought that
slavery was the same as yeah so they'll
create a story in which i'm so dumb
that i made this tweet but it will be
based on misinterpreting a simple point
that it's a waste of time to impeach
anybody after they're out of office
and not gonna run again uh so that's
that's the
fake news play they'll create a fake
narrative and that will be the thing
that you'll have to answer for the rest
of your life
and they can use that against you at any
future time
um i'm actually surprised there's so
many people who think
trump could win uh and i don't think
there's
even the slightest chance you would run
for a lesser office
such as governor or senator you don't go
from president to a lesser
office i mean you could i just don't
think
that's just not anything anybody would
do
um somebody says why purposely try to be
misinterpreted well uh
sometimes i do that for fun and this was
a case where i was pretty sure people
would misinterpret it and i thought it
would be funny
and it was but they'll use it against me
the trouble is that it just won't have
that much effect in my case
here's uh here's a little thing you
should know about
so some academics from harvard duke and
johns hopkins
got together pretty smart people right
if they're
academics at those schools harvard duke
and john hopson
john johns hopkins pretty smart people
got together and released the paper in
which they claim
that the coveted lockdowns will result
in a staggering 1 million
excess deaths over the next decade and a
half
due to increased problems with
health and health related issues because
of
unemployment so what they've done is
they say we know that unemployment
leads to you know x percent of problems
the coronave virus will cause more
unemployment
and therefore you can you can just
figure out how much
that will affect things
here's my problem with that doesn't that
sound like something you want to believe
right when you heard this you said yes
finally
i got science on my side right
but was it science was that science
or was that an economic kind of
projection
except with except economics it's more
of an employment
estimate and then related to health care
and how people will will thrive or not
under
different employment scenarios
here's my problem when you hear a new
paper came out
that exactly agrees with what you want
it to say
that's when you should really crank up
your skepticism
because the best way that you can be
fooled
is by somebody telling you that science
agreed with you
but you got to know that science is
wrong in this kind of stuff
maybe more often than right when it
comes to financial predictions
does this sound familiar in any way all
right
it might sound like my criticisms of
climate change
economic predictions if you've watched
me for a while you know that
i i don't argue with the science part of
climate change because what do i know
i'm not a scientist and their arguments
seem to have lots of backing from lots
of different directions
no matter how they slice it it looks
like co2 added to the atmosphere
should cause warming all things being
equal
but when they take that which i can't
judge and don't have any reason to think
it's false
they take it to an economic projection
over 80 years then it just is ridiculous
because nobody can do that that's not a
real thing that's like a horoscope
reading tea leaves nobody can make an
80-year
economic prediction it's just not a
thing
but they do anyway to scare you into
action today
now the reason that economic projection
doesn't make sense for 80 years is
because there'll be lots of innovation
and surprises you know nobody saw the
coronavirus coming
a lot of surprises could be wars could
be
meteors could be we discover gold and
you know
how to make gold then of plastic i don't
know anything could happen
in 80 years the same is the same is true
of this economic prediction
if you're willing to go with me on the
fact that you can't predict
climate change economics which could be
bad or could be good they're just not
predictable
you just can't predict that stuff
it should be the same analysis for this
do you think people can really
no matter how smart they are because
these are smart people
working in the right fields it looks
like and
would you trust them they're very smart
i believe they're almost certainly
trying to tell you the truth probably
credible professionals should you
believe that
there'll be a million excess deaths for
because of the
shutdowns and grotovirus
when it agrees with what you wanted to
agree with
that's the problem isn't it it's the
same problem with the economic
predictions for climate change
the people who want that to be true so
that their argument is true
they're going to see it as true
um somebody says twitter is ruining
conservatives what do you say
scott well i don't know that they're
ruining conservatives
uh i would have to i think i would have
to see some examples
of conservatives being banned from a
social media platform
for saying things that are true
you know if you get banned for being
reasonable
that would be a problem but if you get
banned for things that uh
you know a reasonable person could say
is hate speech
i don't know if i can defend that if you
get banned for saying things that
um are clearly not true
you have some explaining to do but the
real problem of course is that
it's not it's not
uh it's not applied equally right so
the people who get to decide what is
true we'll say that when
conservatives say something that they
don't think is true they have to go away
uh whereas if if cnn tells you the fine
people hoax was real
or that the bleach drinking hoax was
real or or russia collusion was real
and it turns out it's not that nobody
gets
penalized for that stuff adam schiff
no penalty for lying to the public for
for years
um somebody says why did peter navarro
get kicked off
i don't know the specifics i know for
example in the
carpe duncan situation i think that was
a copyright issue wasn't it
which is just its own its own issue
and peter navarro if he got kicked off i
don't know the situation
people are telling me he's banned i
would assume he made some claim about
the
election integrity and the powers that
be have decided that questioning the
elect
the election is too risky
so where they might allow something to
remain on the internet
that is known to be false as long as
it's harmless
but that one could be you know
potentially uh deadly
if you get that one wrong so
should people be banned for saying that
the election was stolen
i don't think so i don't think so
um but you don't have to say that let me
tell you what i said
recently give you give you a better way
to
approach this um
which i'm pretty sure i wrote down here
maybe i didn't
do oh here it is so here's something i
tweeted
which has not gotten me banned yet this
is a technique which i've taught you
before
which is you take people's opinion that
you believe is absurd
and you agree with it and then you
amplify it
so agree and amplify so instead of
saying i think this election was stolen
which for which there is no court
approved proof
and then getting banned by by social
media
here's what i say i agree with i agree
with the
narrative but watch the way i do it
so here's me agreeing with the narrative
and i tweeted yesterday in my ongoing
effort to avoid being cancelled
so i've set the stage so people know
that whatever comes
is because i'm avoiding being cancelled
and then i say i hereby agree
that an absence of court approved proof
of election fraud
is proof it did not happen courts are
the ideal place for those challenges
software systems are unhackable and full
election transparency
already exists
what did my critics say when i said that
because i just described the
the narrative that's acceptable
but because i'm associated with you know
a political side whether whether i think
that or not i'm associated with it
people are going to need to argue it
which part of this
hundred dollars per word removal i see
where you're going with that but that's
a different topic
um
let me read the the pieces of this again
people call this sarcasm
or satire let me see if you can find
any satire or exaggeration
or sarcasm i'll read the parts again and
here's the clever part
there isn't any there's there's no
there's no hyperbole in here there's no
exaggeration
there's no satire i literally wrote the
mainstream narrative
down first part that i said i agree that
an absence of court approved proof
of election fraud is proof it did not
happen
now as you know absence of proof is not
logically proof of absence but that is
the narrative
it's what george stephanopoulos says
it's what cnn says every day it's what
msnbc says every day
it's what the biden administration says
every day i'm agreeing with them
that the lack of proof is proof that it
doesn't exist
now the fact that that is a lot a famous
logical
impossibility not a possibility a
logical fallacy
this isn't my fault it isn't up to me to
defend
having an opinion which is a logical
fallacy and like a famous one
it's not even a it's not even a remote
one that
not too many people have heard about
it's like one of the most famous
logical fallacies that an absence of
proof is not proof that there is nothing
there
so i simply stated the exact belief
that's coming from every direction with
no exaggeration
are you with me so far you're with me so
far that there's no exaggeration
in that so is that sarcasm
is that a satire it's literally what
they're saying
if i'd if i had extended it that would
be satire
if i had made it something it wasn't
really meant to be
sarcasm maybe but this is actually
precisely what it is
there's no deviation from what i said
from the actual official narrative
that a logical fallacy is the policy of
of the government and social media
literally that's the policy
about the second part courts are the
ideal place for these challenges
the questions about fraud now
do you believe that courts are the ideal
place for this
well you could argue that the court said
we don't have a jurisdiction
so that would be a variable the courts
have said uh
it's too late to make this challenge in
some cases
they've said that there's a technical
problem in some cases
but that's you i mean that might be
something you say
but not me i agree with the mainstream
narrative that the courts are not just a
good place for that
the courts are not just the only option
that anybody has
it's way better than that because the
courts have shown
that there's no fraud and if they can do
something
that powerful to show there's no fraud
without even looking at the evidence
they're ideal
because see how inefficient it would be
to have a court case and
people would present evidence and it
takes months and you need a jury and
it's very expensive
well that's not very ideal is it that's
not ideal
the ideal is they don't even have to
look at the evidence
and they can still conclude with
certainty
that there's no fraud that's ideal
it's ideal so if i agree with the
narrative
that the courts they got this that
you couldn't even come up with a better
place to
take these core challenges it's ideal
and you know that the you're thinking
yourself
scott they don't think it's ideal
they think at this part i'm not making
up
that the courts have settled it
they don't say the courts have mostly
settled it they don't say the courts
have given
us an indication that everything's all
right
they say unambiguously completely
the courts have have decided on this
it's done
if that's true and they decided on all
of this without even having
actual cases you know where evidence is
shown and all that stuff
if they did all that without the expense
of
the evidence that's ideal how can you
get better than that
somebody says the courts did not rule
how does that matter
if they're the ideal place and they said
i'm not going to rule on that then
that's all you need to know
because it was done at the ideal place
so i'm just agreeing with the official
narrative that courts are ideal for that
now you might say to yourself but even
your critics reading that would say
well not really ideal
maybe it's just the only option you have
but that's not their story i'm just
agreeing with their own narrative
then i also said that software systems
are unhackable
that is their position because there's
lots of software involved in the
accounting et cetera
there's no um there's no belief
that they were hacked there's no
evidence of that
or there's no proof of it let's say
there's no court approved president
there's no
court let's say agreed
evidence or proof that any software was
corrupted
so i want to make sure i don't get sued
by dominion or
anybody who's suing somebody personally
i have no information that would lead me
to conclude
that any software system have been
corrupted
but i would go i would agree with my
critics here
as i am quite aggressively that
we also know it can't be hacked in the
case of
the election software how do we know
that it can't be hacked
we know that because the people who are
happy with the outcome
tell us there's nothing to look at if
there's nothing to check
no reason to check what do you conclude
can you conclude that you know
everything's fine without checking
well only if you know that they can't be
hacked
you would have to know it can't be
hacked or at least can be hacked without
being detected
you would have to know it can't be
hacked and is therefore
unhackable to be happy with not checking
i don't see how you could conclude
anything else you would have to assume
that software systems at least some of
them
are unhackable and that this might be
one of them
and you would have to assume also that
the election had full transparency
because if there were if any
transparency problems existed
then the people asking for audits and
more transparency would be right
because everybody wants more
transparency in an election right who
would argue against it
so i'm just agreeing with it the
elections must have already
complete transparency because otherwise
any reasonable person would say oh maybe
we need a little more transparency
but they don't so
find any part of this in which i'm
departing from the mainstream narrative
i don't think i am
i think they literally believe an
absence of court-approved
uh proof is proof it doesn't exist
i think they actually believe the courts
were the ideal place for these
challenges
i think they actually believe that at
least the election software was
unhackable
which which you would have to generalize
if there's any software that's
unhackable
it's all unhackable right because unless
they
invented something that nobody else has
such as a way to keep insiders from ever
taking a bribe
then why doesn't everybody else use it
unless they're just making mistakes
they should use the same unhackable
technology
that the that the elections use if it
exists and i and i believe it exists
because i'm told it does
um and they must also believe there's
full transparency in the election
otherwise they wouldn't be
arguing and saying that everything's
fine
so that would be an example of
aggressive agreeing with people
and how much pushback do you think i got
on that
tweet
it's hard to push back on it isn't it
the only way you can push back on that
tweet
is by disagreeing with your own opinion
because i agreed with your opinion
everything i said agreed with your
opinion so if
if it looks stupid to you i don't see
how that's my problem
if i agree with you and you and my
agreeing with you look stupid
maybe you should have re-thought your
opinion in the first place before you
got me to agree
with you all right
um reuters is reporting that
enrique tario the leader of the proud
boys
which at least reuters calls an
extremist group
makes you wonder what's the definition
of an extremist group
is there is there a definition of that
or can the news just
tell you somebody is you know are
democrats an extremist group
is aoc an extremist for wanting to
radically change the economy with a
green new deal
i don't is an extremist always somebody
who has
bad intentions what's what's it mean
anyway so they they just label the group
extremists
now i'm not supporting the group or
denying the group
or disavowing them i feel like they got
some
they've got some good things but uh a
lot of problem things
with the proud boys so it's not it's not
to me to defend them
uh but you know you can condem
things they do which is different from
condemning all the members
all right and by the way i would apply
the same standard to
every group you know there's got to be
some good people in antifa
probably there's probably at least one
person in antifa
who's not a complete loser
so anyway he's uh he's being accused of
being
an informer a past informer
for the feds and local law enforcement
and apparently they say he's repeatedly
worked undercover for investigators
after he was arrested in 2012
according to a former prosecutor and a
transcript
from 2014 from federal court stuff
so what do you make of the fact that the
leader of the proud boys
is a well-known and former
police informer or law enforcement
informer
do you think he was doing the same thing
with the proud boys
or is that the biggest coincidence in
the world
is that the biggest coincidence in the
world
ah that's a big one that's a big
coincidence
yeah somebody's saying it's a psyop
i can't rule it out i don't have any
reason to believe he was
but uh he's an interesting character and
i would
i would say if if i were a member of the
proud boys
the day that i learned this i would not
be a member of the proud boys anymore
yeah you can do whatever you want and i
suppose
just getting a new leader might be all
you need but
if i found this out that my leader was a
well-known
police informant i'm pretty sure i would
change change organizations or form a
new one or something
gordon chang who is very anti-china
maybe as much anti-china as i am he
writes in the
in the hill that the chinese leaders did
not
test trump militarily they didn't they
didn't push him
but they're already pushing biden
and this part blew my mind this is what
gordon chang writes
in the hill he says that
she president xi looks like he is going
after biden
as it is clear chinese leaders think or
at least thought
they could bully the new american
president now that's the kind of
statement where you say
how do you know what anybody's thinking
right
and that's kind of a stretch but gordon
chang
supports that statement by saying how do
we know that
he goes the derisive derisive is it
derisive or redrisive the derisive
comment of
d dong chang a professor at renmin
university
were recorded and publicly circulated
around china
dee basically claimed that china would
be able to determine
outcomes in washington if trump
lost the election
that's pretty shocking right so in other
words we actually have a recording
where somebody who's a professor at a
university that's
you know well controlled by the the
chinese
government and he was willing to say in
public
that china would be able to determine
outcomes in washington
if trump lost the election
what they're saying it out loud
that if it's biden they can push him
around and that trump they weren't
they weren't willing to push him around
because it was too risky
wow now will you see this story in
reuters
no will you see this story on cnn no
msnbc no no you won't
um so it's it's left to you know pundits
and
people like me and people like gordon
chang to tell you that a story
um i think we're we've reached a point
especially with the ability to
communicate anywhere
anytime adding to that the fact that
humans are bribable and there's a lot of
money in the world
i feel as if we're reaching the point
where
every government is just going to be
controlled by
outside money because they can
and the way it looks like the way
governments will be controlled is
through the news
so if you try to control the government
by let's say
bribing or directly controlling an
american politician
well you can do that but that's a little
risky isn't it
controlling a politician you know
somebody else if somebody finds out the
politician took a check
or did a did a paid speech for some
other country
yeah you're probably going to find out
there's going to be a record of it
somewhere
it's a bad look but suppose instead
you create an army of influenced
journalists who little by little
seep into the into the you know the
mainstream
media and become your news
what happens when you've got some
influential journalists
um influential journalists and they're
they're creating the news narrative
and it's just based from china or russia
or
iran or something that looks to be what
we have
because what would have stopped china or
iran or anybody else
from capturing journalists in this
country
what would stop them from doing it i
can't think of anything
because there'd be probably a hundred
different ways that you could bribe
somebody
and why wouldn't they i'm sure we're
doing it we must be doing it in other
countries right
so the the new uh
the new war if you will is an
information war
i hate to say infowars but maybe
somebody who came up with that term
understood what was coming better than
anybody else
and that
is world war iii essentially you know
world war iii is
you know what we do with cyber plus what
we do with information
warfare so we are in deep
information war with china and iran and
or other adversaries and i don't know if
we know it
it's hard to win a war you don't know
you're fighting right so
china could actually conquer the united
states
just with changing the news narrative
and you know looking at the way things
are going
it looks like they have a good shot at
it right
so our country is given its information
by stooges so here's a question for you
do we know how much influence china in
particular
has on different news organizations
do we know i don't know
somebody's mentioning andy no gno
no and apparently he had to move out of
the country or he did move out of the
country because of death threats against
him and his family
for just reporting that's it
he just reported mostly on antifa and
black lives matter
protests before that you know his family
was targeted
he got lots of death threats and has
moved out of the country
are there any are there any democrats
who've had to move out of the country
yet
because of death threats nope remember
when i told you that republicans would
be haunted
now i don't know if andy would i don't
think he would classify himself as a
republican i don't know
you know i don't know one way or the
other but since he was clearly reporting
on stuff that the left didn't like
and i think he gets you know andy's
probably has more followers on the right
he would be associated with it now when
i said
republicans would be hunted and people
would say to me
mockingly give me one example of that
well there it is andy now he he was
hunted
literally they found his family they
found his home
and they did threats against him and his
physical home he was haunted
he had to leave
they moved to canada and spain on their
own when trump won in 2016. oh yeah that
didn't happen somebody says yeah
yeah nobody really moved rand paul was
hunted by his neighbor
right steve scalise
was funded by that shooter but that was
in a different situation
twitter must really be afraid of peter
navarro's nefario report
you say well you know the trouble with
the navarro report and the trouble with
anything that does a laundry list
of election allegations is that
if you do if you do a list of things
that you're alleging
about the election credibility
that list is guaranteed
to have some on it guaranteed
because we don't know what's true and
what isn't so
if you put together a bunch of
allegations and let's say there are 10
things on the list
there's no way all 10 of those things
are going to be true
no way they might none of them be true
but the one thing you can guarantee is
that not all 10 of them are true
there's going to be an explanation for
something
and if you do if you do that approach it
makes you very
non-credible because it guarantees
you're saying at least something that's
not true
about the election and then you can get
banned
so if i were to give you advice
i would say do maybe one claim at a time
if you think it stands out as one that
hasn't been addressed in any way
then then you would live and die on that
one claim
so maybe maybe you feel like you've got
a good case there
i wouldn't recommend it actually because
it's actually a little too dangerous to
question the election
but if you do a laundry list you're
definitely dead
because the laundry list will have
enough wrong stuff in it guaranteed
that that will be enough to get rid of
you
all right um
and yeah i think some of the math
claims are interesting but they don't
guarantee anything
you know that the statistical stuff
would have to have been
backed up with some some more detail to
be meaningful
it raises questions but that's all it
does
am i moving to texas i think i have too
many reasons to stay here
here being in california not here here
i'm going to give you one more look
we're here in tahiti on the way home to
the states
tonight late flight oh
so tomorrow morning i should be still
flying or at least unavailable if i land
before it's time for the periscope maybe
i'll try doing it from the car or
something if i have a signal
but chances are you will not see me
tomorrow but you'll see me the day after
and i'll try to do it tomorrow if i can
see you later
