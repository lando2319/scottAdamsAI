[Music]
all right it's time to light this candle
and then blow it out
because you've come to the right place
at the right time that's right
congratulations and i think this marks
the beginning of something
amazing for you
the beginning of the golden age
does it look like it i'll give you that
but wow is it going to take off pretty
soon
it's coming
and ladies and gentlemen would you like
to get ready for it
in the most appropriate way it's called
the simultaneous sip and all you need is
a cupper mug or a glass a tanker shelves
or steiner canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dope at me at the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's the
oxytocin hit
that you needed
and it's happening now go
oh did i see somebody say skip the sip
we have a sip denier sip denier
you will not escape
everybody circle and destroy
no we're just kidding
you you can be
you can be a conscientious objector to
the simultaneous sip because you know
the simultaneous step
is designed
to be manipulative
and i tell you that right up front
it's designed to be manipulative
it manipulates you into enjoying
yourself
with your permission
so if you like enjoying yourself
doing the simultaneous step will create
a little trigger
to tweak your dopamine and maybe even
your oxytocin
so it actually is a utility thing
if you skip it
what you're skipping is your own
pleasure
and i feel sorry for you but it's a free
world
have you noticed that everything's
broken
that's because we're we're going to have
to destroy everything to rebuild into
the golden age
but have you noticed that nothing has
ever been worse than airline travel
why is airline travel i say this all the
time but
i'm continuously amazed
it's so consistent
that airline travel is the only thing
that gets worse all the time
it started pretty good in the 60s
and then just got worse
every day
and now uh
some 19 000 flights were canceled or
delayed
since thursday
since thursday
how do you cancel 19 000 flights
and not have the entire you know airline
industry completely
useless
would you even book a flight
if you heard if you knew that 19 000
flights would be cancelled if you knew
that was going to happen
would you have booked a flight in the
first place i don't know what percentage
that is
do you
is that a lot
you know without knowing the percentage
if i just heard the raw number i'd say
well hell with that
there's there's no way i'm gonna
you know i'm gonna get into that but
maybe it's a small percentage i don't
know i've got a feeling everybody was
felt it um
so there were 4 200 u.s flights were
delayed and 900 canceled on sunday
900 flights
900 flights is a lot of flights isn't it
it feels like everybody would feel that
it doesn't feel like that would just be
something that a few people were
inconvenienced by
well anyway
i wonder about the united states and its
ability to fix things and do things this
will be sort of a meta theme for today's
live stream
why is it that we seem to have lost the
ability to do things
is that purely
imaginary
are we actually better than ever at
doing things
and it just doesn't seem like it
or are we trying to do things
differently or are we in the process of
let's take manufacturing
we might be in the process of
leapfrogging the need for lots of humans
to manufacture things and then ship them
across oceans
we may be leapfrogging that to be the
you know the world leader in 3d printing
or something
so there's always going to be this
destruction period before the rebuilding
so maybe maybe everything that looks
like is breaking
is also
exactly what you would see before
everything improves
let me give you an example with airline
travel
probably what's going to change airline
travel this is my guess
is a technological breakthrough
would you agree
i think a technological breakthrough
will change airline travel
here are two things that almost
guarantee it
well three things actually
somebody said facial recognition
imagine going to the airport
and it's all facial at recognition
so there's no delay
you walk up it sees your face and says
yeah you're okay and you just walk right
in
suppose they figure out
how to
uh make all airline flight
uh let's say independent of the
government so there's no tsa
so let me give you a technological model
that would make
a lot of flying
you know different
so imagine if electric planes become a
thing
so that's the first thing the first
technology
is that battery technology
has improved to the point where an
electric plane
is now economical
and not just because of the cost of fuel
lately but because batteries are getting
better
still short range
is still short range but remember if you
got rid of all the regional flying
that would you know
improve capacity for everything else
so imagine if you will that the way that
we fly in the future is that
the flights are
like an uber
they're self self-driving with no
no pilot
it's flown by ai
you book it on your app
and it's pretty close to you
because it's like a multi-copter let's
say a multi-blade
drone do you know how drones always have
i think is it a four
is that the right number do drones
usually have four independent engines
because i think that's the same model
that they're building now
to fly humans
so it would be something like you know
maybe one to several people
getting in their own little flying plane
which is actually now entirely possible
no pilot
no government
no security because it wouldn't even be
worth it for us for a terrorist
no terrorist would want to blow up a
flying plane
with six people in it
it would be terrorism-free
because the target wouldn't be worthy it
would be like blowing up a you know a
bus on the ground there'd be no point
right it's only because planes have so
many people in them
that they even have any and they're so
big that they have any terrorism value
whatsoever
so with with batteries
imagine if you will
that you go someplace much more local
than your airport
because the the copter things can take
up you know they can go straight up
and you just book it on your app you
just walk in you get on it and you go to
la from san francisco
now it you still can still be hard for
the cross country stuff for a while
but just imagine it so here's the thing
i think that the airline industry is so
completely crippled
that a
competitor
like uber the way uber took over taxis
because taxis were a broken industry too
in my opinion
calling a taxi
and not knowing if it would really come
or when
that was really broken
and
and the whole the whole taxi business
couldn't figure it out but then uber did
it
so
so i think there's going to be an uber
situation for the sky
it'll fix flying
um
i saw one suggestion it's the best one
i've seen
for fixing everything
because like is that everything's broken
and i just saw a suggestion on the
locals platform i said that have uh
given that we are probably a simulated
reality
if we live in the simulation
the question was asked
have you tried turning it off and then
on again
and i thought
i wonder if that would work
what if we just rebooted
the simulation and i thought well who
would do it
because you need somebody outside the
simulation to reboot it
and then the other question is how long
do you wait
do you ever have this problem with your
with your wi-fi or your modem at home
you know you have to reboot it so you
you know you pull out the plug
and then you say to yourself
do i really have to wait a minute
engineers engineers talk to me
have you ever unplugged a thing that you
have to you know they say wait 30
seconds or something
do you really think you have to wait 30
seconds
is that real or is that like using your
cell phone on an airplane of course it's
not real
good look at all the answers
people are all over the board on whether
that matters
yeah i get it capacitors have to drain
but you don't think that they engineered
them
so that turning off the power
makes a difference
like actually
you know it goes back to its ready state
i i
are you telling me the capacitors can't
be drained
you know upon turning it off
they're not they're not quick draining
capacitors
if that's a thing
so it's funny that
your answers are all over the place
and that's something we all do don't we
do that don't we all unplug things and
replug them in and we're all wondering
if we've waited long enough
i can't tell you how many times i've
done that
and said okay that didn't fix the
problem
is it because i didn't wait long enough
and i don't think it ever is
i don't think it's ever been
that when i went back and waited longer
and you know unplugged it for longer
that was actually the solution
i can't remember a time that that made a
difference
anyway
uh here's a mind blower that i don't
know enough about yet
so james rosen
wrote an essay for real real clear news
and they're drawing on newly
declassified information about the
watergate
scandal
and here's here's sort of the summary i
haven't dug into it but i retweeted it
so you can do it if you want to
apparently watergate was
wait for it
wait for it
apparently watergate was
fake news
and i think it's actually probably true
that it was fake news now not that there
wasn't a burglary not that nixon wasn't
involved but that the context was that
the cia was behind some part of it
what
and then now we know that
so if that's true
and
and apparently we have this new
information
that says it's true plus there was some
older information that is being taken
more seriously
but if that's true then everything we
understand about that is different
and the context would change from
nixon is a monster and he got caught
and then we got rid of him
two nixon was a victim of the deep state
that took him out that's a pretty big
change
[Laughter]
they can't both be true or could they
well they can't both be true exclusively
so think about that
the most
basic foundational political story in
american history
you know beyond the civil war i suppose
uh the most foundational
modern
story in american history
is probably
fake news
now how many of you knew that
i always suspected
but i wouldn't say i knew it
but i always wondered if it was real
i always wondered
and the reason i wondered is because
everything today is not real
right
everything today is not real almost all
coverage today is
so biased and distorted
that you don't even know how they'll
write the history of it because it's
like there are two histories happening
at the same time how would you write
that history
was was trump a monster or did he have a
good first term who writes that
how do you decide what the history book
says
so i always had my suspicions about it
but here's the the great thing about
this if it turns out that this is true
that watergate was
largely fake news
then this
this thing that we're learning
is
fill in the blanks
worse than watergate thank you
it's worse than watergate
right
if watergate was a hoax
in large part you know not not the basic
idea that there was a burglary that
seems to be true
but if it was largely
completely distorted in terms of what
who was doing what to whom and why
it is worse than watergate
and who would be the people who are
famous for writing the story
see checking notes
[Music]
[Applause]
it would be the guys who are calling
everything trump does worse than
watergate
i
i would like to
remind you of something that elon musk
tweeted not too long ago and
is quite compatible with my own thinking
and also compatible with us being a
simulated environment
and the idea is
that reality will tend toward what is
most entertaining
for the observers not the people in the
story
but the observers
did watergate trend in the direction
that was most entertaining
by becoming our standard
literally the way we describe things as
being bad
as worse than watergate
what would be the most entertaining way
to cap that off
to find out that watergate itself
was never real at least the way it was
you know told to us wasn't real
it's the most entertaining outcome
so there you go
i'm going to put together uh maybe a
list of how to predict things
so this would be one of them
so follow the money would be you know
the the highest
most predictable
way to predict the future follow the
money
uh
but
one of another one would be
that all the news is fake
you know that would be one way to
predict because the next thing you hear
without let me make that prediction
the next big story
whatever it is
and i don't even know what it would be
is going to be
at least fake news for half of the
country i mean maybe the other half gets
something closer to real but you could
predict it today so predicting that the
next story
whatever it is
is fake
is a pretty good prediction
because it would be compatible with the
past
so other ways are the adam's law of
slow-moving disasters
the idea that these big problems that
seem unsolvable we've had quite a few of
them and we keep solving them
and we'll probably keep doing it
because usually these big unsolvable end
of the world problems are a failure of
imagination
in other words we can't imagine how we'd
solve it therefore we say we can't
but we also can't imagine anything about
the future
i mean not accurately
you can't accurately imagine the future
if you could you'd be magic
so the fact that you can't accurately
figure out how
climate change could be solved for
example
it doesn't mean it won't be
it just means you can't imagine it but
you know what else you can't imagine
everything else
everything else
here's another way to predict the future
we'll be fine
that's one of the best filters on the
future
because you that that filter understands
that the news
focuses on you know the most dangerous
provocative ideas
but if you know that the news is telling
you the scariest version
then you can say oh we'll be fine
now
being scared of what's coming is part of
being fine
because if most of the world were not
afraid
maybe we wouldn't do what we needed to
do
to be fine but it's one of those good
ways to predict the world so let's see
if i can remember them all
um
so help me out so you got the adam's law
of slow moving disasters to predict that
we'll figure our way out of stuff
there's a oh we'll be fine
which assumes that you know we get too
much scare in the beginning and we'll be
fine we'll figure it out
follow the money
that always works
everything is fake news
and am i forgetting any
how does adam's law work if we ignore
and don't look at things then it doesn't
work the
the slippery slope fallacy
the slippery slope fallacy says things
will keep going until
a counterforce
pops up
but it always does
that's harder to use to predict the
future though because you don't know
when the counter force pops up you can
only be sure it does all right here's
another one another way to predict the
future
if there's anything that can be
hacked and i'll use hacked
in every sense not just computer hacking
but something you can hack
if something can be hacked and there's a
large gain
potential gain
a low risk of getting caught
and a lot of people involved over time
there's a hundred percent chance the
system will get hacked
am i right
because
i i know there's at least one young
viewer
who mocks me when i say
am i right
but
am i right
all right
you know who you are
um
how young
um i don't know five six
maybe five
i i heard i have a fan
who's uh very young
anyway
um suppose you decided to calculate
reparations
here's a thought i had today and this is
just the you know the bad economist in
me
i tend to think about very geeky things
you know people always wonder like
what's it like to be me
because i have an unusual job
and one of the things is you you
wouldn't believe the weird
you know nerdy thoughts that go through
my head here's one
if you were going to
calculate reparations
how the hell would you do it right other
people have asked this question but let
me ask you this
if you were to study
the amount that the government
let's say spends on its people
people who have needs
various needs whatever the government
provides
would you find any difference between
the per capita
of what we spend on black citizens and
have spent let's say for however many
years
versus
white citizens of america
would there be a difference
and should you and should you include
that
because you could imagine including it
in either direction
suppose you found out that in addition
to whatever you know systemic racism is
lingering from
slavery
what if in addition to that
the average white citizen was getting
more from the government
than the average black citizen
well then you should also say well
that's even worse
so throw that in the calculation
so you can give the black citizens even
more
because you know you would have a
government who not only
abused them during
slavery but then systemic racism but
then
for whatever reason was even giving
white citizens more money for decades
if that was what the numbers told but
what if it goes the other way
because correct me if i'm wrong don't we
give more money to poorer citizens
relative to how much they put into the
system
is that not true
or is that one of those things that you
assume is true but it's not obviously
backwards because sometimes in economics
you get that a lot
somebody says not true
yeah because i think there might be a
contrarian view on this but my point is
this
without knowing that difference
could you calculate reparations
because if what you're trying to do is
say has the united states
treated this group of citizens fairly
wouldn't you have to
conclude all of the unfairness from
the beginning of the country on
to today
and if there was some big difference in
the per capita spending
or per capita benefit from the
government if you calculate it some
other way
wouldn't that have to be in the
the calculation
now of course all of it makes it
impossible right
because you end up with so many
assumptions and variables that nobody
could come up with the same number
so that so you end up
if you did reparations
you would end up just pulling it out of
your ass
because there's no better way to do it
you couldn't calculate it
it just wouldn't be possible and then
i've also provocatively said that the
correct comparison
would be how american black citizens who
have a legacy back to the civil war
how are they doing compared to the
people who did not
get captured as slaves and taken to
america
so with the descendants of the african
residents
are they doing better or worse
than americans
because then what do you say you say
well
you're still doing better than you would
have done
like
so what's the right comparison do you
compare black african slaves and their
descendants
to the
black african
non-slaves
because that would be a logical
comparison but it won't get you the
right result you know then the
societally approved result
everything is about what you compare
things to
and that's one of the reasons that
economists can usually agree with each
other eventually
and non-economists can't
because
anyway
when we talk about the billionaires who
want to control the globe
how many of you believe that's a good
way of understanding the world
um
okay
how many of you think that
a fair filter on the world
is that there's a global elite and
they've got some kind of reset happening
and it's
the point of it is to take over the the
world and they would have the power
okay there's something happening here
that's really weird that i don't
understand
your comments are completely out of line
with what i'm expecting to see
all right i thought i would see 75 yes
75 yeses
but i saw 75 percent of those
interesting now those of you who think
yes
what do you make of the fact
that most of this audience is fairly
similar and
um
in attitude and your philosophy
and yet you're very you would be in a
minority even among the group you agree
with
so the people who think that there's a
global elite at least in this audience
are the minority even among an audience
that's largely agrees with you on other
stuff does that bother you
does it ever bother you to be in the
minority opinion even among the group of
people who are on your side in
general i don't know that it should i
just wondered
because that's probably just a
how you're personally constructed
sometimes it's sometimes people like it
i tend to like being a contrarian so i'd
probably like it
well
i'm going to say this about that i don't
see it
i don't see it
so yeah i just don't see the bilderberg
group or the
world economic forum or anything i just
don't see them as
doing what people imagine they're doing
but imagine let's say they are
let me ask you this
don't you think the other billionaires
have noticed
what do you think they're doing about it
what what is your understanding of the
world if you believe that a certain set
of billionaires or elites
are trying to grab power for themselves
what is it that you imagine that all the
other billionaires are doing at the same
time
are the other billionaires watching and
saying
yeah you know
i'm okay with that
if those other billionaires get all the
power
that's fine because then you know we
billionaires rule
i don't think it works like that does it
if you're one of the billionaires don't
you think that the other billionaires
are your competition
you don't think they're on your side do
you
do
does does musk think that uh
uh
bezos is his competition
or do they think their their buddy is in
the
elite and is elon musk in the elite
what if there is an elite trying to
control the world
but elon musk is not one of them
who are you gonna bet on
would you bet on all the elite
or elon musk
if you assume that he was on the other
team if if these teams even exist i
don't think they even exist
so i don't know how
i don't know how the people who think
that there's a billionaire elite trying
to control the country i don't know how
they explain
the other elites
because if you're telling me that peter
thiel is on the same team
i don't think so
i don't think so at all
if you're telling me that musk is part
of this global elite
i don't think so
i suppose anything's possible right
anything's possible could be could be
fooled by anything
but i don't think so
so
um
just consider that if you think the
global elites are
in control
you have to have a
your theory should include what are the
other billionaires doing about it
you know is bill gates in that club
or is bill gates one of the people that
that club would like to
you know take out how would you know
uh something something about central
banks
again i guess that's what i'm supposed
to say
you can tie it all together by saying
there's something i don't understand
about central banks
so
it's probably them it's probably them
there's a interesting article i will
call your attention to speaking of peter
thiel
by elizabeth dwaskin who's writing for
the new york times
and she tweeted that for a month she had
been working on a big story about peter
thiel
and about how he left facebook et cetera
and it morphed into an examination of
the ambitions to be an architect of the
new american right
i don't know if that's true
do you think peter thiel wants to be
an architect of the new american right
i don't know that seems a little bit
hyperbolic
but i think he's one of the people who
would like to influence things in this
country
so
um
so maybe it's a little bit true
but you should read it because there's
just sort of an interesting
behind-the-scenes
look i'll just call your attention to
that
because it's a longer thing than i want
to summarize
you know i've got a larger
philosophy that says no one understands
economics
especially economists
and that the more you know about
economics the less you understand it
it's like the people who are sure about
economics are the people who know the
least about it
the more you know the more you go i'm
not so sure
and
unfortunately i'm in the category
you know i have a degree in economics
and i have an mba
and i'm in the category of knowing just
enough
that i don't think anybody knows
anything now i'm exaggerating a little
bit
but
here's one you here's one point of view
well i think i'll on my live streams
i'll just show you different points of
view so i can make this point over time
how different people's opinions are
about the economy right now and these
are smart people you know i'm not
talking about your average idiot
i'm talking about smart people
don't seem to have any grasp of what the
economy is about
but joey politano tweets
if you thought that households needed a
negative wealth shock to get spending
down in other words if households feel
they have less money
they'll spend less and that should make
inflation go down
so he's saying that you that we have
that now because crypto's down over 50
stocks are in the bear market
uh it's hard to refinance anything
because interest rates are up
and the housing market is cooling off
so
is that all you need
if if the households stop spending money
or they cut back drastically and it
looks like the the external shocks that
cause that are all there
it should be i mean i feel um
i'm cutting back on expenses
let me ask you how many of you are
cutting back on expenses because even
that even at my income level
i'm actually cutting back substantially
on expenses
because mine comes down maybe
a third
so when i think yeah look at all the
yeses coming by
basically i think all of us are cutting
back our expenses
but
but let me ask the same question
and don't just say yes or no so i'll
know which question you're answering so
say a little bit more than yes or no
but did you also spend more
as soon as you got freed from the
lockdown
like there was a period where you spent
more right you had a little
little pent-up vacation money a little
pent-up entertainment money
so didn't most of you go from suddenly
spending more
and i think i did as well
i know i did yeah i definitely spent
more
like a lot more right after the
pandemic sort of loosened up
but now i'm definitely into spending
less mode
by
far so
are we
is it self-correcting so here's one
thing i think i know about the economy
i believe the modern economy is
self-correcting
and that believe it or not when the
biden administration says inflation is
transitory
i actually think that's true
i actually think that's true it's just
that transitory
is not defined
i think transitory is three to five
years
would you accept would you accept three
to five years as transitory
or not
i mean that's not permanent
i think it's a three to five years
because it's going to take that long to
you know try to spin up any
additional resources
and that's even too fast to you know
you're not going to build a refinery in
three to five years are you
but maybe you could get something going
but in the meantime between now and the
time that we can spin up i love that
phrase because it sounds like you can do
things really easily we'll just spin up
some more factories
let's spin up some extra
capacity it's easy it's just two words
just spin it up
don't tell me it's hard
just spin it up
but if we stop spending inflation should
come somewhat under control
and then the economy will do what the
economy does which is
market competition
should do exactly what biden wants
here's something you're really going to
hate
biden putting the squeeze on all of the
traditional energy sources
might actually work
because even though i wouldn't have
chosen it i would never have chosen hey
do bad things to our energy
energy situation at the same time the
bad things are happening to it anyway
you know from external shocks
i never would have recommended it
but it is nonetheless true
that
emergencies and crises
cause you to act faster and in ways that
you wouldn't have otherwise it basically
breaks red tapes and log jams
so i believe that biden has created
accidentally
a greater energy emergency than there
would have been
but i'm not sure it didn't get us to a
better place faster we're not there
so yeah that's still speculative could
we get there but it does seem to me that
it is entirely true that if you were
somebody looking into investing in
let's say a battery farm
you know a form of batteries just to
store energy you weren't sure that was a
good investment
sure looks like it now at the moment it
looks like a good investment so
there's probably a whole bunch of
investment
that is being unleashed because biden
destroyed the traditional energy market
so in theory
this is all self-correcting in three to
five years
so i i think i'm gonna die on that hill
or hopefully
triumph on that hill and raise my flag
um remember during the pandemic and it
looked like everything was going to go
to hell and we were going to run out of
toilet paper
and what did i tell you
what did i tell you
at the very beginning of the pandemic
when it looked the most scary
i told you everything would be fine
and basically it was
we figured it out we didn't run out of
food
same thing now
same thing now we will figure it out
it will be there will be some
dislocation
currently i have to use a shampoo that i
don't like yes i use shampoo shut up
and
you know so there'll be adjustments like
that
we might be using our currency for the
toilet paper for a while just small
adjustments like that but i think we'll
figure it out and the reason is that we
have we have a self-adjusting economy
like we've never had before
so when anybody looks at history and
says
in the past
when we had these factors in play
you could predict that the next thing
that would happen would be x that
doesn't work anymore
because
take june
on juneteenth
as the model of why history doesn't
repeat anymore
the reason that juneteenth is a is a
holiday
is because slaves in two states didn't
know that they were emancipated for
however many years
they didn't know because there was no
internet
so in the old days
you could you could emancipate the
slaves and the slaves wouldn't even know
it
for a long time
you can't compare that world to anything
in which you have instant communication
everywhere and you can everything's
fungible you can move pretty much
everything to everywhere
right
so we can adjust and and adjust our
environmental standards
and create a rare earth
minerals
where before only china could do it
because they had relaxed
you know standards
but it's an emergency
so you relax your standards or you find
a better way to do it that doesn't
require that
so i've got a feeling that all of this
stress we're feeling on the system
is a lot like the world war ii stress
this feels like a world war ii level
stress on the system and what world war
ii produced
after all the tragedy
was sort of a you know a clean slate
to rebuild so japan germany did well
because they unfortunately were so
destroyed that they could start from
start from something closer to scratch
and so i think we're in an extended
period of destroying what we have but
productively
because we have a system that can
destroy and then fix without even human
interaction
as ian bremer pointed out in a tweet
that if you look at the various
governments of the world that have high
inflation right now
now these are his
interpretations of these governments but
people argue the left and right parts
but he says we've got a left-leaning
government in the u.s with high
inflation the uk he says is a
right-leaning government with high
inflation germany is a census government
with high inflation italy is everyone in
government with high inflation so his
point is that every kind of government
gave you high inflation
and therefore
he says wild gas is not the government
now this is an extension of my
prediction that i made at the beginning
of the pandemic
the strangest prediction that i've made
probably yet
and also perfectly accurate
i said before the pandemic like when it
was just starting
that leadership in different countries
would not be the variable that made a
difference in the outcomes
and that was crazy
right
i don't think anybody took that
seriously it sounded like such a
ridiculous
prediction that you didn't even have to
address it you didn't have to agree with
it you didn't even have to disagree with
it because it was just ridiculous it was
more like absurd
and i said it over and over and over
again in the beginning and and i was
always surprised
that people didn't react to it
they didn't agree
and they didn't disagree
it just was sort of just weird
and here we are
the pandemic's over and you can't tell
the difference in terms of leadership
decisions
there's no difference
why did south korea do well
was it because of leadership
probably not it's probably because they
had access to rapid tests
maybe a cultural difference maybe
because of their isolation whatever but
it probably had nothing to do with their
leadership
right
so
and here we have another example
inflation is high with all these
different governments with all these
different philosophies of government
and probably you can't tell the
difference
can you tell me that germany's
leadership is why they have high
inflation but ours is not
it just looks like there is a global
element to the inflation
and that's all there is to it
everything's disrupted everywhere so why
wouldn't it affect everybody
now i did see shannon bream
take down a
biden administration
advisor type
for
essentially being part of the inflation
especially the energy problem
and
and
she did a really good job i tweeted that
so check out shannon bream
um really giving it to
one of the biden apologists i guess
i ain't using that word but it seems to
fit in this case
now here's
to his to his credit one of the
arguments that um
the biden administration is making
is that a survey showed that when you
talk to the ceo ceos who do investment
in in energy that
90 some percent of them said that it
wasn't the government that was stopping
them from investing
and i didn't see shannon bream
address that point specifically
but i have a feeling that that
data probably is not on point meaning
that
um
meaning that i'm not sure that uh
that that survey is exactly telling them
telling us what we think it is
anyway there's a little difference of
agreement i'm not sure what is true
i'm a little unclear because the
propaganda is so thick from left and
right
and so i can't tell how much is
uh right-leaning propaganda
that says that biden's responsible for
you know cancelling all these oils and
gas leases and stuff but they do have an
argument that those things are trivial
so there's one argument that says that
biden caused this by
everything from not approving energy
projects to closing down energy projects
but the counter argument is yeah he may
have done all those things but they're
so small that they don't really make any
difference
what do you think
because i don't know i i follow the news
and as i i said i've got some economic
background
but i don't know the answer to that
question because i follow the news
i don't believe the news is giving me
straight news on the left or the right
on this question
do you
do you think that the left
or the right are giving you
the
because the right is saying
biden made these decisions
it reduced future amounts of energy
therefore the prices went up it's just
you know two plus two is four
it's that simple
the right says
even if he had done everything
differently
none of this makes a difference in the
near term
so you couldn't possibly be seeing those
decisions in the near term
and you know that people are not so
smart that the near term really reflects
the long term anyway
that's not a terrible argument if it's i
don't know if it's true
so let me be clear i don't know if the
biden argument is accurate or true
i just know it's a good argument
when you hear it you go oh okay that's a
good argument
so let so let me give it to you
and this will be kind of a mind
for some of you
for those of you who are sure because
you believe the propaganda
those of you are sure that our current
energy costs are substantially
and you can determine substantially
whatever that means to you
how many of you believe that you're you
you do have enough information
and that is accurate
and that you understand this situation
and that biden's decision specifically
have raised the price of energy today
how many of you feel confident that that
really is happening
i'm seeing a lot of confidence all right
i guess i'm contrarian on this one i'm
not
i'm not
now the shannon bream argument is pretty
strong the one she made which is she
quoted
biden saying he was basically going to
dismantle the fossil fuel industry
and she says why would anybody invest
do a long-term billion dollar
investments
when he's trying to dismantle the thing
why would you
that's a pretty good
pretty good argument right but here's
the counter argument to the counter
argument
even if people had said okay
we're going to go ahead and ignore biden
even though he says he's going to
dismantle us we're going to ignore him
and we're going to put billions into
investments for new
new energies and drilling and new leases
and all that would any of that made any
difference today
no
i don't think so
so the the democrat argument that even
if everything you say about biden is
true
that he is making decisions that
absolutely will change the level of
availability of energy and the type in
the mix even if that's all true
it takes years
it takes years
do you think that's in the inflation
number today
some of it probably
but i don't know how much and neither do
you
so let me say this
you are in a heavy propaganda
topic
i don't believe there's anybody even the
experts who quite understand
the the entire uh
uh i want to use the word what's the
word from accounting
where your
your income statement is articulated
into your balance sheet
what's the word for that
there's like a
term of art
uh you know what i mean
accrual now
oh there's
not reconciling
right it is reconciled well damn it
there's
there's a cool word that i wanted to use
there that would have been great
yeah well whatever
so nobody understands this topic so if
you imagine that you do then you might
be a victim of propaganda
right if you imagine you know
that biden's decisions changed energy
prices in the short term
i think we could all agree to change in
the long term
because he's trying to change it in the
long term he said he would and he did
things that would change it in the long
term
so if we could all agree on the long
term
could you still agree with the democrat
argument that you're not seeing it today
that's not what's happening today
because it wouldn't affect today
i know it's a pretty good argument
um
pew research
said that 71
of journalists are concerned about made
up news
71 of the people in the business the
journalists
are concerned about made-up news
and that's higher than the 50 percent of
u.s adults who say the same thing
so if you're a consumer of news
half of you are concerned that the news
is fake
if you're in the business of producing
news
71 of you are concerned that it's fake
who would be better informed about how
much of the news is fake the people who
produce it or the people who consume it
that's right the people who produce the
news
are way more concerned about how fake it
is
does that worry you
it should
it should that should worry you a lot
the people who know the most about it
think it's worse than you do
the journalists themselves
yep
you should worry about that
all right um
don't you think it's kind of hard to
fight two wars that are
uh like opposites
so we're right so the biden
administration is fighting the war
between uh you know ukraine and russia
so
effectively we're in that war
financially anyway
and
we're still fighting a war against the
climate
or at least the democrats
are trying to do that
and the trouble is that to fight the
ukraine war
we want to squeeze russia and not use
their resources
but
we need those resources
so
there are too many variables that are
that are working opposite each other
so suddenly germany is is going to be
using much more coal
because russia is going to give them
less gas because of the war
blah blah so basically the one war makes
it impossible to lose to win the other
war
you know as long as we're doing the
ukraine thing we're going to lose the
climate war
so do we have to pick the war
are we are we trying to fight too many
wars
it's sort of a two-front war
that makes it impossible to win on
either front
i feel like we have to pick one
you know either win ukraine
which means go crazy on coal as long as
it takes to make russia irrelevant i
guess
and
uh or fight the war on the climate and
let ukraine go to russia which is what
would happen here's an interesting take
on
again you can see this in my twitter
feed
that
who wins a modern war is who has the
most ammunition
and that's about pretty much all there
is to it
that a modern war between you know two
modernish armies like ukraine and uh
russia
that all that will matter is who has the
most ammunition because they'll both
just keep firing at each other until
they're out
and i thought
that might be the simplest explanation
of how to predict how this ends
but here's the bad news if you like
ukraine
apparently russia has really really good
resources for
creating ammunition as they need it
so they had a lot to begin with
but they can also make it as they need
it
the west apparently has enough for a few
days
and then no ability to make it
so the west doesn't even have the
ability to fight a war we would just run
out of ammunition
now that's not as big a deal if you're
the united states because you have you
know nuclear nuclear-powered submarines
and you know so so nobody's going to
attack the homeland of a nuclear-powered
country with the second amendment
but
if we got into a traditional war with
russia
we would run out of ammunition
so unless unless we somehow won right
away
we would just run out of artillery
so
if you have a war that lasts a long time
all that matters is your manufacturing
capacity
and we're in a war that lasts a long
time so that would tell you that russia
is just going to chew up ukraine
at its leisure
and nothing would stop it
and i think that's that's the way it
look if he were to straight line it and
nothing changed that's what it looks
like but of course
there are always surprises so you can't
straight line anything
here's something interesting
my live stream from the other day
was turned into a transcript on real
clear politics
and then it got tweeted around
now when you change this form the spoken
form into a transcript
sometimes it makes it more powerful
because people
prefer consuming stuff that way
and so it took my uh relatively inert
idea
about having trump not run for president
but create a news platform that would
have honest debate on topics but more
interesting honest debates and basically
control the world through controlling
the news
because somebody needs to do it
and that idea was strong enough
that somebody turned it into a
transcript and then people liked it more
and they're tweeting around now
the moral of the story there's a
higher level than the story itself
is that
the person who writes something down
is the most influential
it's one of the most consistent
things you could say
the person who writes something down
and is good at it
has just tons of influence
so speech writers actually have a ton of
influence over policy
because the speech writer writes it and
then that the politician says yeah that
would sound really good coming out of my
mouth and that just sort of turns into
their their theme
so
we see here that uh taking my inert uh
spoken word and turning into a written
transcript made it actually pretty
powerful and now you see people weighing
in and
um it's
i haven't seen much pushback
it's probably one of the most popular
ideas that i've ever expressed
so take a look at it if you haven't seen
it yet
um
so
here's another uh
tip along those lines so derek
sivers siv ers cybers or sippers i don't
know
he suggests this writing tip and i'm
gonna echo his recommendation
that you write one sentence per line
just for yourself when you're starting
to write something longer
one sentence per line now you say to
yourself
well what's the difference between that
and just putting it in the paragraph
where it belongs
and he
he tells you this
if you write every sentence by itself
you don't get to hide it with the other
sentences
because sometimes you can put a weak
sentence in the middle of a paragraph
and you and your brain will sort of skip
over it you know because the other ones
are have more impact but if you're
forced to write every sentence on its
own line and look at it you can much
more easily say you know what
i didn't even need to say that
because the the other sentences
basically covered it
the other thing is that when you put
them on their own line you can more
easily pick out the first word in the
sentence and the last
because those have more impact
so
um
and those are just you know and then
also you can look at the sentence length
because you want sentence lengths that
you know are variable
but not beyond a certain too long point
right
you can't be too short
with a sentence that's impossible you
can't be too short one word could be a
sentence if you're trying to communicate
but you could be too long
so these are things that you more easily
see if you just break out the one
sentence you can see its length compared
to the others
and some variety
some reasons why you don't want a long
sentence because the brain brains are
not good at following a long sentence
but there's no such thing as too short
because there are times when one word
is all you needed
and even though one word is not a
sentence
often people know what you mean so
that's all you need
i'm gonna get rid of you
all right
so that's your writing tip for the day
and
that ladies and gentlemen looks to be
everything i wanted to talk about
amazingly
and uh
i don't know it
am i wrong or
is this
the best live stream you've ever seen in
your whole world
the other thing i'm going to predict is
if um so yesterday i took a ride on a
electric scooter
how many of you have tried a an electric
scooter especially a high-end one this
was 500 watts
number one it did every hill
without a problem
now i'm not a you know hugely gigantic
human
so you know it wasn't a problem for me
suppose if you were 300 pounds would be
a problem
but have you
have you read
or tried an electric scooter
they are so fun somebody says i hurt
myself yeah they're really dangerous
they're super dangerous
the whole time you're on it you're
pretty sure you're going to die
because they they get wobbly pretty
easily
but you there's also a pretty fast
learning curve
so
uh
here's the thing
if you spend a minute on an electric
bike or an electric scooter
you will know it's the future
now i took a ride yesterday on my bike i
wonder if i could show you this
i know it's
terrible holding something up to the
camera here
but i believe
i can show you this
so where i live
there are miles and miles
of
bicycle only
or mostly bicycle
roads
so this is this is a long road through
wine country in livermore california
in which uh there's no cars
this is just for bikes or whatever
and you you could have the best
like just amazing
like scenery
and you could ride for miles and that's
an electric bike
it's an electric um you know mountain
bike
and
the the hills just disappear
now you ask yourself do you still get
exercise and the answer is yes
yes a lot
because you know you can turn down the
uh the boost the assist
so whenever i whenever i want to just
you know work a little harder i just
turn down the boost
and when i want to you know level off a
hill because i just don't feel like it i
just turn up the boost
now
once you see how wonderful it is to
travel this way you can imagine a town
in which everything is connected by
let's say
hilly little very interesting winding
tree covered
streets that are just for bikes and
electric vehicles
and you can imagine
that
almost like a hobbit city using these
adus or these little boxable
you know instant houses that you take
off a truck and you unfold it and it's
like a total house for one person
you slap on a
solar wall solar you know like a tesla
battery
you can make these little little things
off the grid for the most part i guess
you need sewage or something but you can
get them mostly off the grid
and
there's now a technology where you can
suck water out of the air
enough to actually run your home
so we're at a point where building an
amazing
village from scratch
where you're not looking at your
neighbor
but he's just over the you know the
little tree-lined hill and if you want
to go anywhere to buy some groceries or
something you jump on your scooter
and the and the
the path itself is really fun
right you you've had this experience
right sometimes going someplace is fun
if the actual
destination path
is just really interesting to look at
you don't mind the right at all so
imagine making all of your
transportation fun and easy
it would change everything about your
experience imagine your delivery service
all by electric vehicle
so that there's so many people
delivering all the time
that the cost of getting a sandwich
drops way down because there's always an
electric bike going right past the
sandwich place
to your home
and if you're on an electric bike it
costs you practically nothing you just
drive by hey grab the sandwich
drop it into your mailbox boom
so if you if you were to build a home a
community from scratch
you could do it at 10 percent of the
cost of current living
and it would be so much better just the
lifestyle everything about it would be
better
where is this magic place it's a place
that you could build right now with
current technology
so that's my prediction about where
housing is going it's going to be start
from scratch
build a community
and make it electric bike connections or
electric vehicles could be carts or
any kind of thing
and
off the grid as much as possible
to protect the homeland by the way
because you don't want people to be too
vulnerable to the grid
so you want to get as many americans as
you can off the grid entirely
so they could withstand a grid attack
and there you go
now is that optimistic enough
did you notice today was all the
optimistic stuff
did it make you feel better
should
should
it's going to make you feel great
in fact
you want to take this good feeling with
you
into the day
don't watch the news today maybe
you don't want to blow it
if you got that good feeling
just take it forward
and remember you are the authors of your
simulation
so
i have a request on the locals platform
for a closing sip it's very rare but
today
you're gonna get it
the closing sip for the simultaneous sip
here comes
ah
so good
see you later youtubers
