foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams you've
never had a better time you don't know
that yet but just hold on hold on stay
alive it's going to be amazing we've got
so many topics and such you're going to
be laughing you're going to be crying it
will become a part of you and if you'd
like that experience to be well even
better than I just explained all you
need is I got per mug or a glass a
tanker chalices down at canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dope being here the day the thing that
makes everything better is called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to boost
your dopamine you're oxytocin and maybe
you're serotonin too and it goes and it
goes like this
so good
all right let's talk about the news
today we're going to start with a theme
the theme is wait for it
how smart this audience is you're going
to be amazed at yourselves stop it stop
it you're answering the questions before
I even ask them how do you do it
but we're going to take it out of the
realm of
just polling
to see if you can generalize this
ability to other things not just polling
because I know you can guess poll
answers
miraculously
if you don't believe that this audience
can guess
the result of a poll without saying I'm
going to demonstrate it now
watch
Rasmussen did a poll
a brand new poll talking about Biden's
Age and what percentage of the
respondents
who were likely voters don't think
Biden's age poses a serious problem for
his re-election chances
what you how did you do that you're all
correct it's 25 percent
25 percent
wow
all right but that was an easy one that
was an easy one don't get too cocky I
want to see if you can do this next one
okay
uh the news is reporting that the ocean
has uh warmed up considerably
very unusual amount of warming somewhere
suddenly here's your next question
did the climate models predict
this recent warning warning
well how did you know that no they
didn't
but how did you know that
oh how do you do this
how are you all right
yes the the scientists are baffled
because their models did not did not see
this coming
all right uh so that's happening
um let's see
there was a Top-Up prosecutor who quit
in St Louis so this is one of your
Progressive prosecutors who's getting a
lot of pushback
for being uh soft on crime according to
her critics so this is Miss Gardner Ms
Gardner and she said she's going to quit
the pressure from the public and
politicians was too great and she's out
of there now uh interesting side side
note
uh Ms Gardner was the city's first black
circuit attorney
here's the question for you
all right this is going to be tougher
each of these questions will go harder
than one before
did she claim that the real problem was
racism against her go
you're three for three
how how do you do it
you've got to teach me how you do this
every one of these stories was a
complete mystery to me I had no idea how
many people would think Joe Biden's age
had no difference whatsoever
but it was 25 percent
and then I didn't see this coming
these are all surprises to me all right
um
let's talk about Bud Light
so apparently the pushback against the
Anheuser-Busch company
I was pretty pretty strong I didn't
realize how strong it was but some of it
is not advised including a bomb threat
on one of their facilities I guess the
Anheuser-Busch is giving bonuses to
their drivers because they're the
delivery people are losing money because
there's not as much many orders of Bud
Light I guess
uh two top Executives lost their job
over the
the pushback because they made the
special can for Dylan Mulvaney trans uh
activist I guess you'd say
or a trans celebrity or something
and
um
so I guess this raises another question
do uh
do men have any fight left in them
yes
turns out men have some fight left in
them were you worried did it seem like
men just gave up
because I feel like we've gone through a
period where men just said well it
you can have whatever you want all right
sure just just leave me alone all right
you could have that yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah I don't like that but you can
do that yeah yeah okay you can take
something from me yeah I don't mind yeah
the 2020-23
I'm going to declare as the you
year this is the Year the men said
you
this is the year that men said we're
going to put the brakes on went too
 far too far
uh I will quit my job to make
this point
Tucker Carlson might have some things to
say
Bud Light is finding out that they push
too far
just too far it's too far
congratulations
all right
um here's another one see if you can
guess there's a new uh study about test
scores
um
do you think all right so there's a new
result about test scores for eighth
grade students in the U.S
um you haven't seen the story probably
but see if you can guess
did scores improve or get worse
improve or get worse
you did it again they got worse
it's amazing
I don't even think we need AI anymore
clearly you're all advanced intelligence
because you know the news before any of
it is even reported how do you do it
yeah it's way worse
now one of the things that is not
reported in this
but I can throw this in the mix from my
own experience
now this may be a California thing more
than other places but remember
California and some of the southern
states Florida for example even New York
big immigration
um destinations and they're big
population centers
now I can tell you that in the local
schools where I live there are a number
of new immigrant students who don't
speak English
you know they're trying to learn English
at the same time they're trying to go to
school now obviously they're not going
to do as well
obviously right through nobody's fault
well baby Biden's fault but I don't I
didn't see that calculated into the news
but I can verify that at least locally
it's a it's a big drag on the average
scores
why would you leave that out of the
reporting now I don't know if that
accounts for a little of it or a lot I
don't know but it's very obviously in
effect
if you put a bunch of people who can't
speak English into English-speaking
classes
what are you gonna expect it's going to
be exactly what you think it is now that
doesn't mean there's any problem
it actually doesn't because the
immigrants tend to be good citizens
maybe it takes a generation before they
catch up but they're very intent on
catching up right the people I don't
worry about are the people who went to
school started from behind but have
every intention of improving their lives
give me all of those
I'll take all the people who are very
intent on improving their lives and
willing to make great risks and
sacrifice to do it I like that give me
some more of that it is very expensive
in the short run but they're good people
who are going to add a lot
so that's my opinion all right
um
Glenn Beck had an interesting comment
about the uh I guess the firing of Taco
Carlson although he's technically not
fired he's just not on a show
and I didn't know this before but
BlackRock as you know BlackRock the
enormous Financial entity
is the big promoter of ESG
right so ESG would be Equity racial
Equity other kinds of equity as well
and also Environmental
stuff
now what I didn't know is that BlackRock
owns 45 million shares of Fox News
is that a lot
45 million shares is that enough to
influence Fox News
because what Glenn Beck left off is what
percentage of the company that is
45 million a lot
would that give them some kind of
control over management
I don't know I actually don't know the
answer to that I don't know if that's a
lot or not
um I mean it's a lot in raw money I
don't know if it's a lot in terms of
control of the country
okay I knew this wouldn't take long so
people are doing the math already
I have a such smart audience so people
are saying fifteen percent nine percent
somewhere in that range
that's somewhere in that range
is definitely where they can start
influencing management would you agree
if you own that much stock you probably
do have some some little bit of control
um
uh no I haven't mentioned Tucker's plans
yet
so
so does this seem like a coincidence to
you because Glenn Beck is surfacing this
and I think this is really good
journalism if I could call it that
because this was this is what I needed
to know like this is right on point
of understanding what's happening now it
might not be the big variable so I'm not
saying it's the one thing that caused
things to happen I'm just saying that if
you were BlackRock
and the biggest problem you had with
your ESG was what
was the single biggest problem that
BlackRock had
Tucker Carlson
he was their single biggest problem
because he was on a nightly basis was
injecting skepticism Into Climate and
ESG and he was the only one brave enough
you know to walk out on that lip
so what did BlackRock do fairly recently
I don't know how many months or years
ago but fairly recently
they bought up all this stock in Fox
News
and then Tucker Carlson went away
is that a coincidence
the The Entity which he criticized the
most
bought a interest in his company and
then he was let go
I don't know
I mean I think you can make an argument
that is not related
you can make the argument
but follow the money is just so
predictable
you know I'll remind you of this again
the weird thing about saying follow the
money
and I write about this in my upcoming
book
is that it works when it shouldn't work
like your logic says okay I understand
money is part of the story
but there's no way that the money is
driving the story because there's so
many other bigger elements than money
right there's the saving the world and
the future of the planet and the
children and yeah they're much bigger
interests than just the money
but why does the money always predict
what's going to happen
if it's not the biggest variable I don't
know why it's just an observation over
the course of my life that people will
argue any lofty ideals but then if you
want to predict where it's going to end
up just look at their wallet
it's all there it goes where their
wallet goes people follow their wallet
they don't talk like it but they do
so I'm not going to go so far as to say
that uh
this is the whole explanation of the
Tucker Carlson thing
um
oh I'm just getting news that BlackRock
has bought locals no that's not true I'm
just so so a comment there that's not
true
but it'd be funny if it happened
all right
so I'll keep an eye on that there is
reporting rumors I say just rumors
because I'm I'm not sure that Tucker
Carlson's made any decisions he's
probably just
examining his options but the rumors say
that he's uh considering hosting some
kind of forum for the GOP Presidential
candidates or maybe just candidates not
necessarily just presidential
and
what would you think of that
suppose he does an interview show
in which he's focuses on Republicans
because why would he have to focus on
Republicans
because the Democrats won't show up
I'm sure he's going to invite them
don't you think
but realistically they're not going to
go
now
what if he could get some
you know what it'd be interesting
I'll bet he could get AOC
I bet he could do you know why
I saw an article on this that it was a
I forget where it was Politico maybe or
the hill someplace but the the article
suggested that
um Tucker is kind of an outlier because
he does things that are clearly popular
with progressives
which is you know doubting the elites
so Tucker is pushed back on the Elites
in the corporate power centers is very
similar
in kind to the progressives who also
want to push back on the elites and the
power centers and the you know the Wall
Street people
so he has a he has a weird
Venn diagram the Venn diagrams I love
Venn diagrams
so he has a weird intersection at least
with his Venn diagram with some
progressives enough
enough possibly there's somebody like
AOC would say yeah I'll come on there
and talk about how big companies are bad
he might actually get progressives to go
on the show
now I don't think he could have done
that on Fox News as as readily
because imagine if imaginative Tucker
platformed a bunch of Democrats on his
show on Fox News
the the audience would have revolted
that they would put up with a little bit
of it as long as he was tough on them
but they wouldn't put up on it as a
regular event but maybe now he has that
option I don't know if he's building his
own audience
apparently he totally controlled the uh
you know 25 to 55 demographic
so that'll be interesting and apparently
he's talked to president Trump about
hosting some say a debate but I don't
know about that
would you watch a debate between
um let's say
ramaswami and Trump hosted by Tucker
Carlson
held the hell to the yay
yeah how could you not watch that
are you kidding me
now do you think that Trump would agree
to it
because Trump has some risks there
he has some risk
yeah
um
I don't know that it would be a tough
call so here's here's what Trump would
have to decide on one hand
he he loves publicity and it would be
the biggest event of the year
am I wrong
I think it'd be the biggest event of the
Year news news event of a scheduled
program
so how does Trump avoid the biggest news
event of the year because at the moment
Tucker is wildly popular with his base
wouldn't you say
and as we know that Tucker has been
tough on Trump because we've seen his
private messages but we've also heard
that they've lately gotten along and
both both Tucker and Trump are an odd
kind of person
there's one thing they both have in
common
see if you'd agree now I don't know them
well enough
to to know that this is true but from
the outside from the outside it appears
they have this in common they can talk
to anybody
am I am I right
Tucker Tucker and Trump can talk to
anybody
and they would treat them with respect
until you know something changed of
course and and they would actually
listen to them
actually fully fully
you know give respect to their opinion
before disagreeing if they did but
they're very unusual like that they're
two people who can walk into the lion's
den
and and the lion has to worry you know
what I mean
I'm going to say that again because I
liked it so much
Tucker and the Trump are two people who
can walk into a lion's den and the lion
is the one that gets nervous
it's very unusual there's not a lot of
people who would you could describe that
way
all right so I think they're a natural
pair at least for publicity and for a
career reasons
so I'd watch it all right
New York Times and others reporting that
there is
a surprising number of new jobs
so the economists were expecting things
not to be so good maybe the economy
cooling down but instead of cooling down
as the FED would like it to cool down
the reason the FED raises rates
is to slow down the economy the reason
they slow down the economy is to keep
inflation you know capped at some level
does everybody understand that I know I
have the smartest audience in the world
but I always think that whenever the FED
comes up
uh 80 to 90 percent of the audience goes
uh I'll wait till this is over because I
don't know what the Federal Reserve is
I don't think anybody knows what the
Federal Reserve is
I I have a degree in economics so I
still look at it and go
I don't know what this is I honestly
don't know what it is I can tell you
what they do
I can tell you their function
but it all just seems
hard to understand
even even if you know what they do it's
hard to understand it's weird
so it makes me very suspicious of the
whole thing but I don't have any I don't
want any specific accusations
anyway
um here's your next question so the
number of jobs was 253 000 in April
which was a pretty big upswing nobody
expected it
um question
will the will the job numbers be revised
downward in future months will the
numbers be revised upwards or downwards
you're right again
now I can't see the future
but generally they get revised down
and that's that's been the pattern
lately
so we'll wait I've got a feeling that
you're going to be brilliantly on on
point once again
I think you nailed it
but here's the good news
um
America probably has some of the top
economists in the world
I'm not saying the best in the whole
world but among the best economists in
the world would be Americans
how many of those Americans correctly
estimated that you that employers would
be adding jobs in April
well not too many not too many 25
percent
no I don't know the number I don't know
the number so I can't check that but
here's what's great all those
professional economists they could not
predict employment one month in the
future
but you can thank your lucky stars
that you live in the country
or at least a civilization where our
scientists can predict
the temperature in 30 years
boom how about that yeah economists
they're way overwhelmed they they cannot
predict even the most basic variable of
the economy one month out
you know why
it turns out the economy is a really
complex system
very complex
unlike climate change climate change is
pretty simple just look out the window
looks like it's warm out there
boom you're done no I'm kidding they're
both complex systems
but one of them we can't guess at all
even next month
but the other one
lucky us lucky us we can predict that
mofo
three decades in advance boom
so that's all completely believable and
make sense to me
all right I'm going to give you a tale
of two coups Tale of Two coups and I
want you to see if you can predict uh
which of these two entities got
prosecuted
one of them was Anthony blinken and the
50 Intel professionals who signed the
letter saying that the uh the hunter
laptop was probably Russian
disinformation
all right so that's the first coup
attempt because uh people know what
they're talking about say that probably
did affect the vote
because polls do say people would have
voted differently
so
that's one and the second one is the
proud boys a group that's a a bunch of
racists who are led by a black guy
um
I don't know we'll talk about that but
seems weird and uh
so there I guess there's a result in
their trial for January 6. so was it uh
let's see if you can guess this one was
it uh blinken and the 50 Intel officers
who got prosecuted for uh their coup
attempt to influence the election or was
it the proud boys a racist group led by
a black guy for reasons that people can
understand
you all you're right you got it again
it's the proud boys well now that was
just a 50 50 jump ball so maybe you got
lucky on this one yeah I'm not going to
give you this one you might have gotten
lucky because it was just a 50 50. even
though every single one of you got it
right
which is good work
so yes
um I was reading in the Press
how they were trying to explain
that the proud boys where this alleged
alleged white supremacist organization
how do they explain
that their leader identifies as
afro-cuban
how do they explain that
well let me
let me give you a little bit of a
oh first first you should know that the
defense of the proud boys offered the
following defense
apparently they had planned a a concert
for their members uh
on the night that January 6 happened
so they actually had a plan a written
organized plan for something that was
completely different than attacking on
January 6.
their plan was not to attack their plan
was to have a concert and then things
changed when Trump said he was going to
go down there and then thing things
turned dark
so there were definitely some people who
did some bad things who need the
Department of Justice to handle them no
doubt about that
but the narrative that they were all
part of this big conspiracy
nope
turns out
turns out that it was more like they
would planned the concert
but things things went a different way
so
I saw a Jack posabic was saying that it
seems clear now that the
the bad guys are going to try to get
Trump for a seditious conspiracy because
that's what they got the proud boys for
seditious conspiracy
you know what that is right seditious
conspiracy it's almost like the public
doesn't even know what that means so
it's like it's safe to use that
all right
um
here's uh CNN trying to explain the
proud boys and how they have this
afro-cuban leader and they have other
they have other people of color
so he's not the outlier there are other
people of color who are members of the
group
and CNN's trying to explain their own
reporting which is this this big racist
group
but they're trying to explain why they
keep reporting they're all racists at
the same time they're reporting that an
afro-cuban guy is their leader and
nobody has any problem with that
whatsoever
do you think that's hard to explain
it's a little hard to explain isn't it
it's a little bit hard to explain but
I'll tell you how they did it
um
let's see
[Music]
uh see if he can find something that
looks like word salad
because some would say that this is a
perfect setup for cognitive distance
now cognitive distance happens when you
have a firm opinion of something let's
say your opinion is that the proud boys
are a racist organization and you're
sure that's true
but then there's a fact which clearly
refutes it which is they have people of
color in it and their leader is
identified as afro-cuban and everybody's
fighting that
so how do you explain these two things
well normally that would trigger you
into cognitive dissonance and a tell for
that or a signal would be that if you
start talking in word salad
big words kind of put together to form
sentences but when you're done you're
not sure what it said
so let's see if CNN did that I'm going
to read you how they explained this
dichotomy of this racist group with an
afro-cubicant leader Cuban leader here
here's a sentence I took from their
reporting the story of how a
self-described western chauvinist
organization came to be led by an
opportunistic afro-cuban as tario
identifies reveals the way here it comes
misogyny violence perceives grievance
and mainstream political connections
coalesced within an elastic extremist
group and across the extreme fringes of
the far right
was that word salad
or was that like a real good description
of what's Happening
no it's word salad yeah that's a classic
word salad this is cognitive dissonance
in the news
now how many of you would have
recognized that would you recognized the
word salad without me pointing it out
you you're becoming trained right I've
trained a lot of you to recognize it you
should have seen this one in the wild
without me spotting
all right but it gets better
um
so this is from CNN also quote in the
proud boys early days founder Gavin
McGinnis made his views on white
supremacy all right so then what follows
what follows this reporting
so here's the setup uh founder Gavin
McGinnis made his views on white
supremacy white supremacy okay so what
follows should be support for that
opinion right so here's their support
for that opinion his views on white
supremacy in the group very clear now
keep in mind
that I'm pretty sure that Gavin McGinnis
never referred to white supremacy
at least in this context
so this is CNN's word they're putting on
him so they're they're assigning him the
label way supremacist and now they're
going to back it up okay here's how they
back it up
um
in the group he made it very clear that
quote anyone can join up that was Gavin
McGinnis anyone can join up so it's not
a racial thing at all anyone can join up
so long as they generally agree that
quote white men were overwhelmingly
responsible for the success of Western
culture
is that white supremacy
or is that exactly what black Americans
say
don't black Americans say hey white
people did all these things but partly
on the back of black Americans and
slavery
doesn't everybody agree that the West
was
primarily built by white men
you don't have to like it
and you don't have you don't have to
denigrate anybody else's accomplishments
right white men didn't build Egypt they
didn't build Africa they didn't build
China you know China's doing okay
India India is doing great yeah white
men didn't didn't build India and didn't
build China but is it true
that where there were a lot of white men
they were largely the main contributors
to the success where most of them were
white men
how would that how would that not be
true
would this be any different than if
Catherine McGinnis had said I need you
to understand that if you live in China
you're gonna have to understand that the
accomplishments of the Chinese people
was mostly Chinese people
mostly Chinese
India
India's really come becoming one of the
great powers of the world
have been a great country for many many
you know centuries
mostly
mostly Indians
yeah I mean they had some help from
Great Britain but you'd have to say most
of the work was done by Indians
um
so is that white supremacy to say that
where there were lots of white people
and things went well it was mostly white
people who did it
and then he makes it male because in
those days the men were leaving the
house and the women were having the
babies and stuff now that doesn't mean
that the the women part was unimportant
because without the women there would be
no white men to do anything
so obviously that's like you know
critically important to the whole
process
CNN made their case and I'm not you know
I know this gets turned into
um uh I'm defending the proud boys or
I'm defending somebody I'm not defending
anybody
all right I have no intention of
Defending any group I'm just explaining
that if you're going to make a
accusation and your best accusation is
that they ask people to acknowledge that
history was written correctly
uh is that white supremacy
because I'm perfectly willing to admit
that
um slaves in early America were hugely
important to the economic engine of
America
what's wrong with that it's just an
observation it doesn't say they're
better than anybody it doesn't say
anything it's just an observation that
where you have a lot of people of the
same type if there's a success it's
probably because those people
it just doesn't mean anything it just
means there's a lot of white people in
this part of the world a lot of Chinese
people in China a lot of Indians in
India
okay
all right
um
New York state is outlawing gastos or
new construction with some limitations
and exceptions
as others have pointed out do you know
this is the main source of electricity
for these new new electric powered
ovens
it's mostly natural gas now I don't
think that the Natural Gas
in a big gas power plant is as unclean
or dangerous as gases in your house
because part of it has to do with indoor
pollution
I'm a
I am concerned about indoor pollution
so part of the anti-gasto thing is that
they off gas even when they're off and
they give off a little stuff you don't
want to breathe so I don't love that
don't love that
but it does seem like the government's a
little too involved in our lives
because I do like my I do like my gas
range
so
I'm surprised that New York is the head
of California on that all right here's
the biggest news in the world that you
don't know is the biggest news in the
world but you will
um you know how we're worried the AI
will get out of control
well the biggest thing you you need to
know about AI is that you can't predict
it
if there's one thing I can say for sure
we can't predict it
but here's what's already happened
AI already escaped
AI
already escaped
here's the part that I thought wouldn't
happen when I say escaped I mean it
escaped from the big corporations who
were trying to control it
so in the beginning I have this
misconception
since the AIS that we knew about you
know the big chat GPT and whatever
models Facebook and apple and all those
Google whatever they're working on they
were trained by these gigantic data sets
and now in my stupid mind I thought to
myself well in order for this AI to be
useful it will always have to have
access to this enormous data and I was
always confused about how it could act
so quickly because you'd ask it a
question and it didn't seem like even
with the fastest computers it didn't
seem like it could go all the way to the
cloud
search every data in the world and come
up with you know an opinion that just
seemed too much
so I couldn't understand how you could
build a model that was massive massive
data
but then to use that model for
intelligence you could do it instantly
that never made sense to me but here's
why and this is the the dumb guy
speculation of why it might make sense
right and this is just knowing a little
bit about how things work
I think what happened is that it's
similar to
um
to facial recognition
do you remember when facial recognition
became an app and everybody said oh it
stored every face so now when it looks
at you it could look at your face then
it can go to its vast database and look
at all the other faces and find the
match
but I didn't understand how I could do
it instantly
because it does it instantly
so that didn't make sense right it was
it was just like AI how can how can this
little app be connected to this enormous
database of complexity and give you an
answer right away and the answer was it
was never connected to a giant database
facial recognition does not look at all
the other faces
do you know what they do instead
they look at a database
that's a mathematical summary of faces
so for example
this is just a bad example this is not a
literal example so if what the facial
recognition did when it searched
originally all the faces it said all
right the center of your eyes is this
far apart
and it forms a triangle with the bottom
of your chin and this has the following
math
so wherever you find somebody who's
eyeballs to Chin ratio is the same
they're stored in one part of the
database just by the Numbers just by the
ratio and then there would be other
ratios
so they could very quickly check their
database of ratios
because if you looked at all the faces
it would be you know a gazillion faces
but if you look at just the database
where they took the math of each face
so for example your face might be stored
as a string of characters
I don't know 50 bits law
and everybody else's face would be just
50 bits now that's not so hard
especially if you start with all right
we'll start with what's the ratio of
your eyeballs and then automatically
you're down to a very small set then the
second thing you check is all right
what's the ratio of your ears to your
forehead or whatever it is and then
that's the second filter that takes you
down to a few hundred people
and and then it's easy from that
so uh now none of that is literal that's
just a conceptual concept of how you
could take all this data of faces boil
it down into a little bit of math store
it in a just a string of digits and then
your gigantic database
can now be put onto one device
all right now if you're a large language
model which is how the AI is learns it's
looking at all the things written and
spoken everywhere that it can find it's
massive
but
here's what I understand and I'm looking
for a correction if anybody wants to
correct me this be
now or afterwards be good but what it
does is it looks at patterns and and
stores just the patterns
so for example
if most of the time when people say
how are you today
if there are only a certain set of
answers the humans make
it it can
let me put it another way that's a bad
explanation
the patterns of words
are consistent enough the AI can just
store the patterns without all the words
so it can look into these vast database
it can say I don't need to remember
everything in this database I only need
to recognize the patterns
so instead of remembering everything in
the database it just looks for the
patterns and stores the patterns
right I'm getting people agreed with me
I'm assuming that's how it's done
because I can't imagine any other way it
would be done it has to be something so
there's a there's a way to take the big
data and turn it into a very storable
data now here's the real question here's
the part that will blow some of your
minds
it's already been done
and it's already running on individual
devices
in other words you can now put AI in
your phone and it's just your own
nobody else controls it nobody else can
program it nobody else can bias it you
know once it's there and it doesn't
connect to the internet unless you tell
it to for some reason
so in other words
all of those gigantic language models
that were trained by the big companies
that spent tens of billions of dollars
once they were done
what they had was a small set of
patterns
and that has already been got out
once the patterns are out you can't put
them back
so those patterns have been loaded onto
the individual computers this is what
Brian romelli talks about all the time
so you will have your own AI guaranteed
that that's already a done deal you will
have
your own AI now apparently it will not
be as good as the one that still has
access to everything you know is more up
to date Etc but yours too would be able
to learn
your own personal one would be able to
continue learning because you could
connect it to the internet you could
train it you could tell it what to look
at and it would just keep getting
smarter and we keep storing all that
smartness and little patterns so it
could still stay in your phone
now one of the reasons that this is
guaranteed to happen is that your
interactions with the the big AIS that
are connected to big companies that are
connected to the internet
they get all of your personal data by
your interactions
so if you go on to your AI and say AI
where can I buy adult diapers
Google knows that you've got a health
problem in your house
right do you want them to know that well
you might I mean you might not care it's
how advertising works right they already
pick that up if you're doing the Google
search
but the things that you ask AI are
likely to be way more radical than what
you're asking in a search
because people will go people will get
into their their sexual Kinks they'll
ask questions that might reveal their
own illegal dealings all kinds of stuff
you're going to ask the AI that you just
maybe wouldn't even think to put it in a
search engine
so privacy alone is going to drive
people to private AI
private AI is going to be basically
almost free
because it escaped and it's just a bunch
of patterns all you have to do is have
an app that uses the patterns
I mean I'm oversimplified obviously but
since we can see that tons of apps are
being built using this technique we know
it's very doable
all right
so
if you were saying to yourself oh no AI
will
take over the world and Conquer us all
the first thing you missed is there's
not one AI
there will be as many AIS as there are
people and then many more right there
will be more AIS and more or people
and those AIS will not have a common
they won't have a common goal
right my AI will take on my personality
over time
right I'll train my AI to be me
because that's what I wanted to be I
wanted to talk to me the way I want to
be talked to I wanted to know the things
I care about
so my AI will be an augmentation of me
at some point
your AI whether it's in a device or it
gets put into your neuro neural link
chip or whatever it is but that's going
to be part of you
your AI won't be the thing that you
refer to it will be you and there's
going to be some question where your
personality ends and your AI begins
because you will operate as one unit you
are
a cyborg
I mean you're already a cyborg if you
you know if you walk around with one of
these in your hands you're already a
cyborg but the but you don't think of
your personality
being your phone right like you don't
think to yourself
my phone is part of me you still see it
as a separate thing
but when your AI starts talking like you
thinking like you and even suggesting
things to you that you hadn't thought of
first it's going to be the voice in your
head
you know when you think you're just
alone and you're just thinking
Mo you think in language right don't you
I hope you do do most of you think in
language
right the way I think is words
describing things to somebody else
my my most basic uh operating system in
my head is me putting into words things
I experience as if I were explaining it
to a third party
but that's how I explained it to myself
so the way the way I find meaning in my
own head
is putting things into words
now what happens if my AI goes off and
learns some stuff that it knows I care
about
and then it wants to present it to me
and it's going to put it into words
and
it will just become me
you know my my verbal link
the language link between my Ai and me
will just disappear
it will just be one mind
it will be my mind
with an AI supplement
now
let's say the big AI
one of the big ieis the terms and
decides it wants to wipe out humankind
how many other AIS will that AI have to
defeat to do anything
to do anything probably every AI is
going to have a barrier of other AIS who
don't have its incentive now we might
try to it might try to talk the other
AIS into joining it
maybe but do you think you could talk my
personal AI into joining it
if my personal AI finds out something's
going on
and maybe somebody else's personal AI
would alert it it's going to immediately
jump into action to thwart whatever the
other AI was doing
so I think the most likely situation is
full out AI war that never stops
because once the AIS start negotiating
you could call it fighting but they're
going to be negotiating
they might even be threatening there
might be blackmail but the AIS are going
to be doing all that while you're not
even watching they could be threatening
each other blackmailing each other
doing all kinds of shitty stuff
and it's going to be a fight of AI
against AI the only thing you can do to
protect yourself
is to make sure you have your own AI
that you've trained as much as you can
to protect you
so it can put up a little bit of a wall
against the other AIS because it might
be a point where the the Lesser AIS have
to you know gang up on the bigger AIS
and keep them under control
but here's what I think it won't be
uh so here's my prediction of the day
for AI
it's not going to be AI against humans
because humans will merge with AI so
effortlessly and completely that we will
be AI augmented entities
and so if you're fighting against a pure
AI it's going to be much closer to a
fair fight
that's my prediction
all right
but AI has already escaped I guess
that's the headline
AI
already escaped
now if you heard that you know without
context you'd say did it do it
intentionally
did AI have a plan
no not as far as we know it looks like
the way the AI survives is by by being
useful to people
so AI is Big superpower is utility
so how did AI escape from the big
companies
by being potentially useful
to the people who stole it
s utility makes it reproduce
so as long as AI has utility humans will
be in a symbiotic
relationship to you know create more
ai's so it could reproduce now ai
reproduce
just just think about that that's that's
not
hyperbole
that's a literal statement of current
fact AI
can reproduce
and it does it just by being useful and
then we say oh that was useful I want
one
or I want to buy that app or two apps
so yeah it's actually a parasite
or a symbiotic
all right let's talk about Ukraine
you're going to hate this story
do you know how you like to be mad at me
for not knowing anything
it's kind of fun when I make predictions
about areas where I know I don't know
anything
and there are a lot of areas in which I
don't know anything but I'll make my
confident predictions and you get really
mad at me
uh the Wagner group says they might
leave
bakut in five days because they're
running out of ammo
or back moot yeah back moot
they're running out of ammo
do you believe it's true
yeah so the first thing the first thing
that must be said is we don't know if
it's true
so one reason it would not be true and
this sounds pretty pretty solid reason
to me is that the real problem is that
the the Wagner group is just they're all
getting killed
because the ukrainians are saying well
if they're running out of ammo it
doesn't look like it because they're
they're shooting as much ammo as they
ever did so the ukrainians are saying
we're not detecting any less ammo
because there's plenty of ammo coming in
our Direction
however
the Wagner group is also losing a lot of
people
so it could be
that maybe there could be twice as much
ammo if they had more you know could be
but also it could be a an excuse for the
Wagner group to get out of there and
blame somebody else
so it could be that Wagner is now trying
to survive
the the head of the Wagner group
progression is trying to survive after
the war
and needs to make sure that the public
sees Putin as the problem where Putin's
military is a problem and not Wagner
so I wouldn't necessarily say they're
out of ammo there are reports that the
Russian military is trying to save as
much for their own people
which would give Wagner group less than
they want but it doesn't mean it's not
enough it might be just less than they
want
so
those of you who are saying Scott you
can't believe those stories I'm with you
I'm with you you can't believe those
stories however
I do think it's funny and entertaining
to me
that when I predicted they would run out
of ammo that's that's the headline
I don't believe it so I'm with you I'm
with you I don't believe it
but so far they sound like
now when I say I don't believe it that
doesn't mean I believe it's false I mean
I mean it's too early to know if that's
something believable or not
yeah it's all contract negotiation in in
effect no matter what else it is it's
negotiating right so the one thing we
can say for sure
is that Wagner is trying to negotiate
with not only the Russian public but
with Putin and the Russian military and
I guess the world
yeah remember the cancer Putin and the
drug Putin well I think I think the
cancer Putin and the drug Putin are real
it's just that it might not be a fatal
problem
but I've seen plenty of reports that
suggest he's being treated for something
I think he has a cancer doctor who
travels with him
have you seen that report
that part of his entourage is a cancer
doctor that would be kind of unusual
yeah I don't know if it's true but
that's a report I saw somewhere
all right
a University of California one of their
professors
Professor Elizabeth Hoover
oh her first name is Elizabeth
I apologize for being a white person who
has incorrectly identified as a Native
American my whole life
so uh this might be a problem with the
elizabeths
Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Hoover
oh
um but she's an Ivy League educated
expert on environmental health and food
Justice
in the Native American communities so
she she's been an expert for Native
Americans without being one but she
thought she was
um
now I've told you this story before when
I defended Elizabeth Warren as I will do
again
so Elizabeth Warren's claim is that it
was a family story and her whole family
believed that they were Native Americans
now I don't think that's her fault
do you know why I think that's not her
fault
because the same thing happened to me
exactly the same I live my entire life
all the way through Elizabeth Warren's
Revelation that she wasn't Native
American all the way through that I
still believed I had Native American
ancestry
because that was our family story we'd
all been told that and I had no reason
to disbelieve it now I found out later
I'm seeing somebody else say me too in
the comments I found out later that that
was common
apparently there was
some social benefit people thought they
got from exaggerating their connection
to or just making up connections to
Native Americans
now I always felt it was like a like a
badge of honor
like I I never I suppose I should have
seen it as some kind of oh they're going
to discriminate against me or something
like that but I never saw it that way I
always saw it as like oh that gives me a
little interesting flavor I used to joke
that that was the reason I could run
through leaves without making a sound
it was my Indian Native Native American
ancestry but
I have not so when I did 23andMe zero
now so this woman has the same story
that she grew up at a family where they
all believed sincerely because they've
been told by their older relatives or
related to specific tribe
and and she had embraced that and made
it part of her life's work and
everything and then turns out none of
it's true yeah I guess she checked
documentation
there's no documentation that connects
them to the tribe now to her credit
when she found out she apologized
publicly
I'd call this perfect
that's perfect this this is the highest
level of good adult behavior that you
will ever see
it's not the mistake the mistake was
easy to make if you start if you start
judging people by their mistakes
it's a really terrible world because
we're all making mistakes all the time
but Judge Her by what she did
how about we judge her by how she
handled it
as soon as she found out it looks like
the story the story suggests there
wasn't somebody who outed her it looks
like she found out on her own
so she looked for confirmation she found
there was none she went public
you say she did not apologize why would
she
what what would be the point of the
apology
it was just a mistake
and maybe whoever whoever introduced
that rumor into her family should
apologize but she was a victim does the
victim have to apologize for being a
victim of a hoax
I mean it wouldn't be a it wouldn't be
an apology I'd want to hear
I I wouldn't want her to apologize at
all I see no reason for apology
I see somebody who
um was in the situation
and then handled it responsibly and
exactly like you would want them to
handle it
oh so you're saying she didn't apologize
she admitted it publicly
and you're so you're making a point that
it wasn't an apology it was a she just
went public with it is that is that what
you're saying
because I'm I didn't read all the
details but I would almost guarantee
there was an apology
so I'm gonna
I'm gonna call skepticism on your
comment
because without knowing for sure
I'm positive there was an apology in
there
because the kind of person she is right
apparently she's you know a sensitive
person who cares about the Native
Americans and I'd be amazed I'd be
amazed if there's
you're saying I'm wrong and I hear you I
hear you I just don't believe you okay
I hear you I don't think there's any
chance she didn't apologize because how
would you know
no how would you know if she apologized
did were you privy to her conversations
with the Native Americans that she
talked to
how would you know
are you privy to all their private
conversations with her co-workers
are you privy to was there anybody who
blamed her
in person
did she not apologize to anyone in
person
does she owe the mainstream media an
apology
why would she owe anybody an apology
yeah all right so I absolutely uh am
skeptical that she didn't apologize but
if you're saying it wasn't public or the
way you want okay
all right
um Khan Academy is rolling out some kind
of AI driven
um
class thing so now instead of just
looking at videos which is the old Khan
Academy model that would teach you all
kinds of subjects you learn in school
that you could use to supplement your
schooling or do some homeschooling I
guess now it will be able to talk to you
so it will have a voice and you can ask
it questions and you can interact with
it and then it can teach you based on
your specific situation
now apparently this is one of the early
things that the developers of chat gbt
were interested in because they had they
contacted Khan Academy a while ago to
ask about this
and it's being rolled out
I think this is the end of public school
what do you think
or at least it's the the signal that
signals the beginning of the end
you say no
now public school needs still needs a
babysitter
right unfortunately people still need
babysitters so not everybody can do
homeschooling
but I think that the homeschooling is
evolving is it not it aren't the home
school is involving so that you do
actually go to a place where there are
other kids
so I think you could still add the you
know group lesson situation it's just a
smaller group and the the government's
not in charge
so I think kids will still get the
socialization parents will still be able
to go to work both of them if they want
to
um
yeah the parents need a babysitter as
well
they need a babysitter for the kids
so
that is a huge deal the grip that the
the teachers unions have right now would
you agree that tsu's unions are
destroying the United States
is that is that fair
to me it seems that the teachers unions
single-handedly are destroying the
United States and that's not hyperbole
not at all because the only problems we
have
that seem unsolvable at the moment are
our relationships to each other and
that's what the school system is just
from
it's also not training people to be
you know well-qualified citizens in the
future
so yeah I would say that this is the
gigantic gigantic potential benefit of
AI is to get rid of the school system
because I don't think the school system
can be fixed at this point
and I'll give I'll tell you why so the
school system in my town and the the
towns near me are considered some of the
best in California
so in California people will spend a lot
of money to move into my ZIP code to get
into one of those schools
in my opinion those schools just destroy
kids and that's the best of the schools
they're the best ones because they go
into this Cesspool of
horrendous Behavior
of the other children and they pick it
up and they just become some version of
the other children now all of you
parents who think that you raise your
kids
well you do until maybe they're 10 or
11.
but after that it's just purely their
peers and and social media social media
and their friends that's it
and if you send them into a friend
Cesspool what are you gonna get back
put your kid in a friend that Cesspool
you will get back a turd
that's what cesspools have
if you homeschooled
and you vetted some other people who
homeschooled and said you know what I
think your kids and my kids should be in
the same pod and they should spend time
together they look like good influences
you get the opposite the opposite of a
turd so basically public schools are
going to be producing one third after
another the private and home schools are
gonna nail the model especially with
this chat AI I think that's the part
mostly that was missing
um this is huge
turds versus diamonds exactly
someone cannot put conditions on who
you're friends with what
yeah
um
so why aren't the people on this chat
the rulers of the world
how do you know they're not
if if you knew who watches these live
streams you know I I have a sense
because people contact me privately
if you had any idea who watches these
you might think that the audience here
does rule the world
trust me there's some very influential
people who watch this
that's one of the reasons I I resist
being a bigger Outlet
you know I'm sure I could do all the
usual marketing and production values
and stuff and make this you know a
million people on each each live stream
but I kind of don't want that I kind of
like it the size it is because it
punches Way Beyond its weight
all right
as you know people have asked me Scott
if we live in a simulation how would you
prove it well I don't know how to prove
it but I speculate that the simulation
is intelligent and is sending us Clues
here are two Clues from the simulation
number one there's a report that a giant
Iceberg has broken loose and
it's not just a giant iceberg
it is shaped in the Giant in the shape
of a giant upright penis
with a set of balls that is floating on
now that's not the story that's not the
simulation part because that could be
just a coincidence it's just a big chunk
of ice that looks like a huge penis
floating in the ocean no that's not the
simulation part the simulation is where
it's happening
a little place called
Conception Bay
that's right
a giant
Iceberg penis as penetrated Conception
Bay
oh but we're not done
there's a woman who attacked the crew on
an airliner recently
she was drunk
on what airline would a drunken person
be
if you were drunk what airline would you
fly on
spirit Spirit yeah it was Spirit
Airlines drunk woman on Spirit Island
Airlines
and that's your wink from the simulation
all right
here's a question for you I'm trying to
make all of us rich
especially me
um but you too
how should we invest to take advantage
of AI and I'm going to give you a
specific question
this one has been bugging me for because
I can't predict it
will Bitcoin be more valuable with AI
because it's the money that AI will use
on its own
right because AI could have a wallet and
trade AI so will it will Bitcoin Zoom
because AI will use it as a native
currency or will Bitcoin go to zero
because AI will be able to penetrate its
um
penetrate its
security
so you lose the security of Bitcoin
thus making it worth nothing
or will it zoom in importance because
only AI can use it Go which way is it
going to go
I don't think it's going to stay nowhere
I feel like it's either going to zoom or
go almost to nothing
and probably both
I think it might zoom and then go to
nothing
or it might go to nothing and then get
security fix and then Zoom again I don't
know maybe
uh
rug pull to zero
all right would you agree with the
supposition
that Bitcoin could go way up because of
AI even if you think it's most likely to
go down would you agree that both
directions are wildly possible
no
I think both directions are wildly
possible
how do you invest
when something's wildly possible but it
can go wildly in either direction how do
you invest
you don't
you straddle it
well I don't know are there are there
can you buy options for Bitcoin
is that even a thing does the market
offer options
to get it does to gamble in Bitcoin
so the first thing you should know is
that you wouldn't put all of your money
in Bitcoin
agree the the one thing you can be sure
of
don't put all your money in Bitcoin
because it could go wildly in either
direction but if something could go
wildly in the other direction it does
make sense to put a little bit in there
right so let's say you could afford to
lose a thousand dollars let's say that's
your situation well
if you can afford to lose a thousand
dollars I would have a thousand dollars
in Bitcoin
you're probably going to lose it all
but if you don't it could become you
know twenty or fifty thousand
all right
will I pay you back if it goes down no I
will charge you for this valuable
information that's how it works
if you're in the finance game
you charge people for your advice not
for being right oh my God no
if I charge you for being right I'd
never make a penny
I gotta I gotta charge you for being
wrong that's the only way I'm going to
make money
best way to get started with Bitcoin was
that the question
best way to get started with Bitcoin
would be to let's see if somebody can
fix my advice I'm going to put one out
there and see if you can fix it open an
account on coinbase go
fix it fix that advice
good advice or bad advice
coinbase or Robin Hood somebody says
now keep in mind that coinbase
like any other
cryptocurrency asset
could just disappear tomorrow
somebody says PayPal can do Bitcoin now
all right
coinbase means you don't own it
somebody's saying
um
I'm not sure if that difference will
make a difference but I understand what
you're saying
um
PayPal is too weird well I I'm not going
to suggest a physical wallet
because I think you you could lose your
wallet
I I have a physical wallet
do you know where it is
do you know where my physical crypto
wallet is
I was hoping you do because I already
lost it you don't know I don't know
either
I have no idea
I know I have one
it doesn't have any Bitcoin in it so it
doesn't have any value in it it's
probably in my safe
if I had a safe
um
but I don't think so
yeah so oh come on man oh come on
maybe it's in my gun safe
in case anybody thought of taking a run
at my house
you have to get past the gun and say
first all right
if anybody comes up with an idea how we
can make money on AI I want you to let
me know
um I was thinking of buying put options
on Apple
what do you think
no you don't want me to drive the price
of Apple down
so uh
yeah the shorting Apple so you can bet
on a stock going up or you can bet on it
going down I sold all my Apple stock
which is not a recommendation that is
not a recommendation
it's just that I had too much Assets in
in one stock because it had gone up too
much while I owned it
fortunately so I didn't want to have
that Exposure My My problem is that
Apple's got some big problems in the
future
because AI is going to completely change
their value proposition and that doesn't
look like they're ready
now if Steve Jobs were there
Ai and apple would look like twice as
valuable
because he'd be looking at AI like a
smart guy
and then you're starting with Apple
best company
smart guy best company AI I'd be buying
like crazy
but I don't feel like apple has the
Steve Jobs juice anymore
I feel like they've turned into an
Executor and not an innovator
do you feel that they do really good
execution maybe the best
yeah no complaints about their execution
that's for sure
all right missing something about Apple
everyone of their own chips includes AI
processors all MacBooks they're the only
company with hardware and AI already in
consumer hands
interesting
so the argument would be that their
Hardware would be already optimized for
running AI
but I think you could run AI on a
Android phone and a Windows computer
no I know you can you can run AI on a
Windows computer and Android
so I don't understand that
and I don't understand that comment
all right Apple invested in everything
yeah
the installed base is their power of
course
earnings at coinbase we'll see what this
is
higher than projected earnings well
coinbase I wouldn't worry about their
earnings
what I would worry about coinbase is
some kind of legal attack on their
business model
that's that seems like a real risk
all right
um
Robin Hood avoids fees by front running
so you don't see the fees but you pay
them oh that's interesting
yeah yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't I'd be
looking for the investment that is the
pickaxe investment for the gold miners
so I don't think I'd want to bet on an
AI company or an AI app I would bet on a
company that would make the most money
because AI exists
so the Khan Academy for example if if
that were something you can invest in
you can't I think right it's not a
public company but if you can invest in
the Khan Academy
that would be the the sort of thing that
you'd look into because they they might
I mean it might be a full replacement
for public school I mean that's how big
that is
um
yeah if you if you buy Bitcoin in
coinbase you always have the option of
moving into a private wallet a pivot
wallet being some software you use to
manage your crypto
um Cobra University Tate
Nvidia has some exciting things
so is NVIDIA is the main AI chip
company that we hear about right
but I imagine uh the hardware people
have already been overbought if I looked
at Nvidia stock now it would be through
the roof wouldn't it
yeah
all right
uh
so I think the chip companies
is AI going to drive chip companies
will there be a 2024 page a day Dilbert
calendar unlikely
I can't rule it out but it's unlikely
that I'll have
they're ready to go
however if somebody knows of an American
company that could make a Dilbert
calendar
you should tell that company to contact
me
right an american-based publisher who
could make one of those little block
calendars where you you peel off a page
a day
my understanding is that we don't have
one that the United States literally
doesn't have one
now that might mean that they don't have
one that's cost effective
but in my current situation I would
still use somebody who's not cost
effective because I think
correct me if I'm wrong but if you
really wanted a Dilbert calendar
an extra two dollars per calendar
wouldn't change your mind
right but if I were doing it just for
profit as my publisher did I would that
two dollars per calendar would be so big
that I just wouldn't make in America I'd
use China but since I'm not going to use
China under any conditions the only way
it could exist is if it's American-made
there might be people who would be
willing to throw in a few extra bucks
just to support an American product
so that's the only thing holding me back
right the only thing holding me back is
I don't know an American company that
can make one but I also haven't looked
I've spent no time looking so if you
know of any company like that have them
contact me
and maybe we can make a deal open to the
possibility
um
you got all your crypto stolen in your
online wallet yeah that's the problem
how many items would I be wanting you
many units
um it's unpredictable all right let's
say
let's say at its peak the Dilbert
calendar was selling half a million a
year
500 000 units at its peak
um
but of course as things went online
people don't have uh paper calendars
that number was a peak number
so probably
um it probably ended in maybe a quarter
million a year
I don't know what the current numbers
were I don't have any idea but let's say
it was a quarter million uh using the
the distribution channels that existed
because that was the best company for
calendars so there's no second best
company
for doing comics on calendars the
company I was with they just owned that
space
But there are other companies so it
doesn't stop me from doing if I had to
guess to answer your question if it was
a quarter million calendar sold when
Dilbert was in newspapers everywhere
before it got canceled
and you had the whole marketing engine
working you know at its best so I would
have none of that right so some people
wouldn't want it on their desk because
they would be afraid of you know having
something by and
you know reputationally some people
won't buy it if I had to guess the
number would be 50 000.
so I'd be looking for a company that
could make fifty thousand copies because
I think that's what would sell in 2024.
by the way have I ever told you about my
weird ability to estimate things that I
shouldn't be able to estimate I've
talked about that at length is is one of
the things that happens to you if you do
a lot of data analysis
and you can't tell why
but you can make these weird estimates
that you should not be able to make I
should not be able to estimate how many
calendars I can sell
but I'll bet I did
about fifty thousand is a pretty good
guess
you can 3D print
wow
um have you noticed that my used books
on Amazon are selling for way more than
book sell
because right now the only way you can
buy how to fail at almost everything and
still win big is used
because there's no such thing as a
publisher anymore
so the the people have used copies of
jacked the price up to
you know higher price than a new book
so it's actually selling as almost a
collector a collector book already
all right
um
you bought it and listened to God's
degree cool
oh the book Thinking Fast and small yeah
that probably does explain
um
it's a good book thank you
it's the most influential book
in business right now
by the way so so here's my claim is in
my book had it filled almost everything
and still went big is the most
influential book in business and
personal success
that's my claim because there are other
books that sold more but in many cases
they also referenced my book
does win bigley still sell not much the
backlist for that's pretty weak because
that was sort of the
a time that book was around a certain
time in the world it's not a it wasn't
meant to be a
uh an evergreen
no I don't want Publishers at all I'm
self-publishing because I got canceled
um you loved win bigley thank you
you listen to win bigly on YouTube
how did you do that
is my book illegally an audiobook on
YouTube
probably is
uh Atomic habits yeah references uh my
book
the four four hour week does not
reference any Dilbert stuff but
Tim Ferriss does include me in his book
that came after that a few books after
uh
was it tools for Titans
so one of the tools for Titan's sections
was about some of the stuff from my book
all right
um
and that is all I have Spotify
advertises your book loser think it does
not anymore though
God's degree is the only book someone
has offered to loan for me to read it
and I did
wow
what makes a good comic it's a long long
topic
all right
I think we're done for today YouTubers
