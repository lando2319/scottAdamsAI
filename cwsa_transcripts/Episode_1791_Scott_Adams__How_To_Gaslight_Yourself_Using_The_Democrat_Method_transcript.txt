good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to
the highlight of civilization
one uh
correction and or clarification
a lot of people think that when i
turn this on i'm saying
as in
b-u-m
no no
it's p-u-m
you have to get it right otherwise the
whole thing goes downhill
it's a slippery slope to not talking at
all
and if you'd like to take today's
experience up and that's what it is it's
an experience it's not a show
it's like joe rogan had it right it's an
experience
and your experience might include
grabbing a cup or a mug or a glass of
tanker jealous tonight i can't eat
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
media of the day the thing that makes
your oxytocin
hum
it's called the simultaneous sip it's
famous everywhere it's changing the
world go
now you don't have to drink
just coffee
somebody on locals says that they drink
only
freshly melted mountain snow
to which i say
now that's that's something i aspire to
well remember uh i had this great idea
uh
according to me and nobody else
that one of the biggest trends in
america
would be these
little homes that are actually kind of
awesome and you can build them in a
factory
they're part of the adu movement
where you can put a little one for your
in-laws in the backyard or whatever
but i said that the real big gain is
going to be not that you can put these
in your backyard because that's a
limited market but that they would build
they would design communities
where they're only these little homes
and then the whole community would be
designed so even though the inside of
your home might not be
palatial
the way the community is laid out is so
well designed that you just love living
there
and
have i ever told you that all of my
ideas have two qualities
i think elon musk said this recently too
so my ideas have two qualities one
there's no way they will ever work
that's the first quality there's no way
that iv is ever going to work the second
quality is somebody's already doing it
it's always those two it's impossible
man somebody's already doing it scott
you don't have any creative ideas and so
here it is again so sure enough
uh they're in atlanta there's a place
called
and this is not a joke
south southparkcottages.com
and go take a look at it i think it's i
think it's
what's going to happen and here's why
the cost of living in what i'd call a
legacy house
a house that was built for the lifestyle
of the 80s
just doesn't work
it's like an insane amount of expense to
maintain it and everything and it
doesn't even have basic stuff that you
would need
for today's lifestyle right is built
around a television set
right modern houses like the living room
is sort of built around watching tv
but people walk around with their
headphones and their phones now we're
not you know sitting around the screen
so that the basic lifestyle
has so changed since 1980 you have to
you have to start over and since you
couldn't possibly afford
you know a two million dollar house
that would have cost you know two
hundred thousand dollars not too long
ago
you can end up
getting these tiny little homes but
living in awesome communities and you
actually will upgrade your experience
you want to hear something that'll
really make you mad
suppose suppose they're mostly rented
let's say people build a community
and investors each get to own a little
house
that they rent so it's basically a way
to invest
if you did that
the people who lived there would
and let's say they're even furnished
because i think they think they might
even come furnished
but
if you did that and you were renting
you would own nothing and you would be
happy
what does that sound like
is that world forum
uh new world order thing right yeah
klaus what's his name
uh he said in the future
you will own nothing and be happier
now the way you interpreted that is
we're all going to be communist right
you will own nothing and be happier you
all be communists
maybe
maybe that's exactly what he meant i
don't know but here's the other thing it
could have been
it could have been that personal
ownership of property is impractical
i own a house
and
walking from my home office where i am
right now
to the kitchen
do you know how many distractions and
unnecessary things i have to think of to
walk from here to the kitchen
that that trip is filled
with adventure
every time
and the adventure is there's something
broken
leaking
or spilled
every time i make that trip it's just
it's just right downstairs
it's literally right below me i just go
to the stairs and walk down
and i can't even get there
without a whole bunch of problems that
are caused by
what are all the problems caused by
my ownership of the property
it's my problem because i own it
but if somebody else owned it would sort
of be their problem
so
there are two trends
that you should watch one is that
everything's more complicated
have you tried to do
anything lightly
have you tried to do anything
it's so complicated
to do anything here let me give you an
example
i had silenced an alert
for somebody a while ago
and i was trying to undo it
do you know how many ways you can
silence an alert on your phone now so
you try to just undo it and you can't
 figure it out there's like one
way on the line you know you can do it
on the line where they show up in your
thing you can change your focus on the
iphone there's like a focus thing that
turns off your alarm sometimes there's
also a way you can block them
individually
i think there's five ways oh but you
could also turn off
the physical alarm on the phone
so trying to get oh and i also have my
phone set so that only
people in my contacts call me so simply
using my phone
just when it's just
too hard
the other day
i've reached a certain age so now i have
to
i had to look into this thing called
medicare
now
do you have any idea how complicated it
is to sign up for medicare
and they make old people do it
this is the worst thing i've ever seen
and i had to actually hire somebody i
paid somebody to go figure it out for me
because i couldn't
let me say it again
i have two college degrees
and i don't think that i'm slowing down
that much you know with
age two college degrees
i couldn't even come close to
penetrating how you sign up for medicare
or even what it was
i actually couldn't even barely figure
out what it was or why you need it or
who gets it you know is it is it income
um
limited is there some kind of you know
window does it save you money
does it give you worse or better
coverage
i didn't know any of that
and so i actually had my my bookkeeper
who is awesome and does lots of things
for me
um
help me figure it out
and so she she came back with a lot of
details
and just to sign up for it
there's like it's taken me days to
collect all the things here are the
things that i need
i need for example
information from my first marriage like
the beginning and end dates of my first
marriage like not even my current ones
beginning and end dates of
corporate you know of my employment
which is complicated because at one
point i'd
set up a corporate account but it was
really the same job how do you handle
that because it's really two entities
but the same job
and so i've been working on this for
days
i'm like searching through records and
you know finding things and so far all
i've gotten to is collecting the
information i haven't even got to the
point
where i have to go on online and try to
fill it out
now imagine that everything's like that
this is the stuff that has to get fixed
all right let me let me let me
describe to you
a future city and see if you'd want to
live there
it's a future city doesn't exist
the government has one job besides
defense
right so it's going to do your physical
security in your police but it has
basically one job
it's an insurance company
it's the only one
so you get everything from your car
insurance to your life insurance to your
even your appliance assurance
you would insure even your appliances in
your home with the
government and the governments would not
tax you
no taxes
you would just pay for insurance
but you'd only pay once and you'd never
have to shop
because everybody would get the same
insurance because it'd be awesome
there'd be nothing missing
you would never have to look at your
insurance you'd never have to figure it
out you'd never have to do it yourself
but you would also never be not covered
here's another thing have you ever tried
to form a partnership or a
corporation because you have a small
business
it's really really complicated and
unnecessary
in the city of the future
everybody will have the same protection
as any corporations do you know why
because there's no reason not to
there never was
there's no reason that somebody who
hired a lawyer
and then turns himself into like an llc
a limited liability corporation
or uh or a corporation s corp
there's no reason that they should be
protected and the person who didn't have
the lawyer to do that is not
just make the law that says everybody
has that same protection that's it
you can get rid of lawyers
you can just have standard contracts
just get rid of lawyers every contract's
the same
right
so you can imagine starting from scratch
and just say what if we got rid of all
the complication of everything
you know all insurance and laws and
all that stuff you can do it and home
ownership is insanely complicated
now you might like it and you would
still have that option
but if i could get rid of all of the
complications of ownership
of property
and my car do you know how many how many
problems i have with my car right now
i think i have three different alerts
and by getting it to the
getting it to the dealer getting the
right time getting a ride back because
uber doesn't work here anymore you know
organizing with somebody else's schedule
and then there's gonna be parts and you
know like everything every single thing
i own is a project
i have almost no time to work
because i'm just taking care of my
broken all the time and i don't
it's not like i own that much like i got
one house one car but it's all broken
all the time i just had to take my you
know
i thought i was all happy getting an
e-bike until that started breaking
anyway
um simplification
in uh today's comic dil well this week
dilbert's company decided to go into the
business of making voting machines
how do you think that's going so far
i wondered if i would get cancelled for
this
but so the setup is that dilbers company
decides to get into the business of
making voting machines
now of course
you're all going to read into it that
i'm really making fun of an existing
company
but i'm not
i mean i don't need to i'm simply
showing what dilbert's company would do
if if they were in that business
so if you read into it anything else
that would be on you
but let me tell you what today's comic
was just so you know what kind of
trouble i'm getting into
the boss is describing to his team
he says elbonian hackers got into our
voting machine software
they deleted our secret backdoor access
for rigging elections and
fixed several critical security bugs
and then the boss yells our homeland is
under attack
and dilbert looks at him and says
which side am i on
um so that was the setup
now
people are wondering if i will get
canceled for this kind of watering
myself
kind of wondering myself
yeah have you noticed how close i skate
to cancellation
now i i maintain that it's actually easy
to not get cancelled
i could prove myself wrong
but i maintained this very obvious what
is over the line and therefore you can
walk right up to it
because it's so obvious what what it
would take to go over it you just don't
do that
like it doesn't happen on its own
you have to actually write something
that's pretty you're pretty bad
and i just don't do that
so i feel like i'm frustrating the
people who must be looking at me to try
to cancel me at this point
you know don't don't you believe that
there's a constituency if you would call
it that
of people who are really really looking
at me hard and saying oh you are so
close
we are we are locked and loaded if you
go one more step
one more step
we gotcha
but i don't so far
i probably will
i mean if i had to if i had to bet on it
i'd bet against myself i think
but here are your gaslight reminders
this is courtesy of the democrats
these are three things that you need to
remind yourself because if you didn't
remind yourself of these on a regular
basis
you would fall out of the the gas
lighting um
let's say
zone
so if you want to stay gasoline
and keep up with everybody else because
that's that's the state of the country
there are three things that you must
accept number one
you can conquer a superpower with bear
spray and clubs
you have to hold that as true
number two
you can know something doesn't exist
by not looking for it
you must hold that as true in order to
stay in your gasoline zone here
and then the most important one every
government system in the united states
is corrupt and non-credible except
except for all 50 individual and
different state voting systems
those are a plus
now those three things you have to you
have to keep in your head as true
or else nothing else you see makes sense
because there's sort of the the tent
poles
of the uh the gaslight operation
so if you don't accept those three tent
poles which are
frankly
ridiculous
you can't be part of the gaslight
um
speaking of gaslighting so there was a
by nade on cnn
who who was asked what do you say to
those families who say listen we can't
afford to pay 4.85 a gallon for
a guest for months if not years we can't
afford that what do you say to them
and the biden that advisor said and his
name is brian diaz
uh dies d-e-e-s-e
uh as in uh these nuts
these nuts yeah so that's where it came
from that's saying uh
when when people say how about these and
you say these nuts that was from brian
actually no was that true it's not from
him
um anyway brian diese
responded to that question by saying
quote
this is about the future of the liberal
world order and we have to stand firm
wait what
wait wait wait what
i actually had to play it back again
because i thought well no
he didn't actually say that did he now
apparently biden has said that before
i don't know how far back biden's
actually used the term
something called a liberal new world
order or nor liberal world order
the lwo i guess
and so basically he he was saying
that the this change toward a you know
liberal-centric world with i guess
climate change
being addressed more aggressively etc
uh that that's where we're going and
that's where we want to go and that is
more important
than your family eating and buying gas
and
he says it directly
he's basically saying you know tough it
out
you know tough it out
people
because we've got bigger fish to fry
we we want to
make things
like we want them
when i hear that
it sounds like somebody cares about
winning
more than they care about people
because why did you have to put liberal
in in the description of where it needs
to be
i feel like i feel like he described a
team competition
where he said yeah you know some people
are going to get hurt
but our team has to win
because when you say it's about the
future of the liberal world order that's
not even a set of benefits that i even
understand
that sounds like it's about
it's about the new york yankees winning
the the world series
isn't that what it sounds like
like what are the reasons like what
can you give me any meat about what are
the good things that we will have
because you just mentioned the name of
the team
mentioning the name of the team
feels like you just see this as a
competition like a sport
like you're not even taking seriously
that the people that cnn to their credit
to their credit and this is always worth
mentioning because cnn's trying to
transition
to more straight news but to their
credit they were asking a tough question
which is what the hell are you going to
do about gas prices because there's no
good answer
and their answer is
what's more important is that our team
wins
basically that's what i heard
it's jaw-dropping isn't it yeah and a
lot of people were were doing the tweet
you know they said the silent part out
loud
they really did
this really is a silent part out loud
that the
the team
element here is the important part
dammit
well biden said he might support
changing the senator's filibuster rule
specifically for the roe vs wade stuff
and does that work
can somebody do a fact check on me i
didn't have time to do it
did
isn't that what mitch mcconnell did
for getting
justices through
so don't we already have a one exception
to the filibuster am i wrong on that do
i have give me a fact check on them
oh that was harry reid
harry reid did that okay
but can you fact check the question
was that carved out as an exception to
the filibuster rule it was right
based on specific legislation
right so here's the first question
would it be
copacetic
i mean forget about whether you want it
to happen separate question
do we want this to be part of our system
do we want a system where you could
change it for a specific legislation
because
wouldn't you then change it for every
legislation that you wanted to get
through
why would you stop with this one
everything they want to do is probably
important
right
so why would you say this is the one
place where we'll make that exception
i don't know
feels like feels like uh
i hate to say slippery slope because
there's no slope at all
the moment you say this exception can be
made and maybe harry reid already did it
the moment you say there could be an
exception then there's no point in the
filibuster anymore is there
because you'll just make an exception
whatever you want one
i mean if the majority can make an
exception why won't they do it all the
time so there's something here i don't
quite understand
maybe you do
um yeah maybe they knew it needed just
to pass a budget yeah you're right
all right
but here's again more of a theme
you could argue that changing the
filibuster rule would destroy the system
others would say it's better
but it seems that
continuously
republicans favor supporting the system
even if some people get a bad shake
because of it
because all systems have that quality
there's always somebody who's worse off
for pretty much everything
whereas the democrats would rather
destroy the system
to handle an individual or a specific
case and when is destroying the system
ever the right choice
well if the system is bad i suppose but
is this a bad system is the filibuster
part of a bad system or a good one
and it seems like
it could be a feature as often as it's a
flaw
and i guess it depends if the things you
like are getting stopped or not so it's
not even whether you think it's a good
system
it's whether it's getting the result you
like i think but you see it again this
is the single biggest difference between
democrats and republicans in my opinion
that the republicans consistently back
the system
if it's been working
right not if it hasn't been working but
i have if it has been working they say
yeah don't break it if it's working
and the and the democrats would break
any system to get a specific result
without maybe seeing that that's going
to be worse off in the long run
how much do you think is the difference
between whether you can see the long run
like it makes you wonder if
you're arguing against systems no i'm
arguing four systems
all right
makes you wonder if really the political
differences are how far in advance you
can see
and maybe that's it
all right
uh there's a new apple watch coming out
i guess it's more durable or something
but
this is how ai will take over
i think the apple watch
is such a clean example of how it will
take over
people's um
people's habits are already being
changed by the watch right
how many of how many people wear the
watch will
get up and take like extra steps because
the watch says you haven't been active
enough today
a lot right and as the watch as the
watch gets smarter and smarter
and let's say you can monitor more of
your your
bodily functions and stuff maybe even
watch what you eat
you know at some point
you could just turn your watch toward
your plate
you know at some point
and you don't even have to tell it to do
anything because it'll just be watching
everything all the time you just say all
right here's my dinner
and then later it'll tell you you're
overeating or you didn't get enough
vitamin a or something
so in the long run
the ai
will rule us
by giving us good advice
that's all it takes
it just has to give us good advice
sorry
if if the watch gives you good advice
and you follow it and you like the
result
you'll very quickly
be addicted to its advice
and you'll start thinking oh it'll
almost be superstitious
oh god
the watch is telling me i need to take
another bunch of steps
if i don't do it
i feel like something's bad is going to
happen because when i do do it
everything good is happening
i'll just do it
the the ai don't doesn't have to kill us
why would the ai kill us
it needs us to you know keep the
electricity on in the short run
the ai will just control us by having
good advice that's better than whatever
you were thinking that's it that's all
has to do and then you'll just give
yourself over to it
as long as it makes you happier by doing
that you'll just give yourself up to it
it'll be like any other drug
yeah you think you can resist it
you can't
well we have crossed the parity
crossover point
you thought there was nothing beyond
that
now the parody crossover is where you
read a story or a tweet and you actually
legitimately
can't tell if it's a joke
because reality became so absurd that
the joke
and the reality if you don't know the
backstory you really can't tell
but we've gone beyond that
there's another level beyond it i didn't
think there was
and the level beyond it is that we can't
tell the difference between
a thing
and the opposite of the thing
it's not just that we're in two movies
we can look at one thing
like even an object or an action
and
some people will think they're looking
at the opposite of the thing
you need examples
otherwise i'm not going to be able to
sell this
right sounds too crazy
all right
i had a discussion with a pro-abortion
citizen i won't give you any details but
a pro-abortion citizen of the united
states
who was quite furious
that these nine old people on a court
would be making abortion laws
and and i said
well then would you favor that maybe the
people should vote and maybe the
majority should rule
and she said absolutely this should be
the people deciding
not the courts and i said wouldn't it be
better if instead of federally
you know you could make it the state
each state decide because if each state
decides then you know some people might
have different decisions but at least
you'd be living in the state where your
majority was
making the decisions
and she said
absolutely
that's exactly what you want you want
the states
to be the ones who decide on these laws
what you don't want you don't want the
supreme court these like nine people
like how is this right that nine people
can make a decision for millions of
women
she argued
uh you really need to put that to the
states
i made my case
we literally can't tell the difference
between a thing
and the opposite of the thing
she most of you realize that she was
arguing for the exact thing that the
supreme court ruled that the supreme
court should not be making the decision
it should be put back to the states
she thought she got the opposite of what
she was really mad about and was
becoming like an activist
she was actually politically motivated
to like really start yelling and talking
to other people and you know maybe doing
something about it
because she couldn't tell the difference
between
the thing
and the opposite of the thing
now you're saying well that's a
a weird special case right
like you can't come up with another
example
where somebody can't tell the difference
between the thing and the opposite of
the thing
like that's you can't come up with
another one of those
or could i
or could i
um
how about election integrity
um
we actually are under the impression
that the election was good because no
one checked
that's the opposite
of proving the election is good
the opposite of knowing an election is
good
is consciously deciding not to check
that's your second example
we can't tell the difference between the
thing
and the literal opposite of the thing
and we're looking at the same thing
because to me
an election in which you have decided
not to audit all of the election
is an election which you definitely
don't know what happened
but people are looking at that and say
oh
we didn't check
and we didn't find anything therefore
we've proven that there's no problems
it's that's the opposite
it's the opposite
bill barchek
i don't think he did
um how about this
um
the re do you know the reason that we
know russia hacked
uh some emails or whatever and
interfered with the elections in the
united states in 2016. do you know how
our
our experts
know
it was russia that was behind the hacks
was it because there was a russian
hacker who confessed
no it wasn't it was because the people
who looked into it the experts
said that the the tools that were used
and the the methods that were used and
even the types of things that were
attacked
are our signature
um they're they're signature moves of
russian hackers
so the way we know it was russian
hackers is that they used russian hacker
tools they acted like russian hackers
and they
accessed things that a russian hacker
would access
which is also exactly what you would do
if you were trying to hide who you were
and make people think it was russian
hackers
so here's another example
where the thing
is the opposite of the things
the thing is
that we know it was russian hackers
because they used all the methods of a
russian hacker
but who else would use all of the mesh
methods of a russian hacker
anybody who was good at it
and wanted you to think it was a russian
hacker
do you know who would be good at it and
also know all the methods of a russian
hacker
the united states
right and other foreign intelligence
agencies
but if they're trying to convince us it
was
the russian foreign intelligence
agencies and not
the united states foreign intelligence
agencies
how exactly did they do that
by showing us that the methods used were
the same methods that would be used by
the russian intelligence agencies
or somebody else
so if you show that the tools that were
used are the same the ones that would
use by the russians
and also someone else
would that be proof that the russians
did it
or the opposite
it would be proof that you couldn't
tell it's proof that you can't tell
because if you know
what russian tools and methods are
common
then you also know how to make it look
like a russian attack
you can't separate that if you can
identify it after it happened
because this is how they look
and you could have done it before the
fact as a fake one because you know how
they look
have i made my case three examples
where we can't tell the difference
between the thing
and the literal opposite of the thing
that's where we're at we can't tell the
difference
you know if i told you before this live
stream that i could give you three
examples of that
you wouldn't have believed it
but it's here
all right um this was a funny twitter
comment from a user named jules just
somebody on twitter
and was responding to somebody else who
was talking about the the so-called
insurrection
and jules says quote in a reply
what was trump's plan after he took over
the capitol building and hung
and hung like
right after he hugged mike pence because
because
the democrats actually have it in their
head
that there was a living human being who
thought he could take over the capitol
with an unarmed crowd
hang mike pence and then go on to
victory
and like well let's calm things down now
i've hung the vice president and took
over the country turned it into a
dictator with my lack of firearms
and uh
and if there's anybody else i'm gonna
hang uh nancy pelosi she's probably next
i'm sure that would happen in their mind
all right
but uh i thought this was a serious
question because i can't tell the
difference between parody and reality so
when jules says what was trump's plan
after he took over the capitol building
and hung mike pence i answered it
because there's sort of an obvious
answer to the question
under the assumption that you had
conquered the united states without
using firearms with this group of
protesters
the obvious thing to do would be to get
that same group of protesters
and send them over to ukraine to
recapture crimea
now i don't think it would take more
than a day
and
they would suffer some casualties
because you know they did suffer
casualties also when they
conquered or almost almost conquered the
united states without firearms
they came so close
people we dodged one but obviously if
that group could conquer the united
states a superpower with nuclear weapons
and if they could do it without firearms
that is exactly the kind of fighting
force
you want to bring to crimea
to kick the russian occupation force out
and deliver all of ukraine back to
nato's embrace
so jules i know you thought that was
like a funny question but it wasn't
there was an actual answer to it
uh
free crimea
well um you've all been watching the sh
or hearing about the show trial the
january 6 ridiculousness and of course
if you
are familiar with all of the news not
just the
bubble on the left
you know that it's a ridiculous show
trial and that it actually has just made
democrats look worse and trump look
better if you're paying attention and
you can see the whole field
so what would be the
expected outcome
of
the democrats showing that really
they're just a political organization
and they have nothing but kangaroo
courts and blaming people for stuff what
would you expect to happen well
rasmussen did a poll they do they track
the generic
election between a generic republican
and a generic democrat it gives you a
little bit of insight what might happen
on the midterms
and there had been like a eight or nine
percent lead for the generic gop
and that just shrunk to five
so a vast
uh shrinking
of the advantage that the gop had and
what does that mean
what else is happening
correct me if i'm wrong
but there's nothing else happening right
it's not like there's something else
going well for the democrats you know
inflation didn't get fixed or anything
so there's only one thing happening
so i'm pretty sure that you can look at
or at least this is my speculation
i won't say i'm pretty sure
but it looks to me like the democrat
method of just fooling the people with
this major hoax
is working
it's working
now you think it's row
do you think row is the the main
difference and not the show trial
because remember
we also dipped down before row was
announced so this is the second time
that rasmussen has had this dip
but the first time was before row was
announced
but it could be that the show trial had
a dip and then grew back because that
looks like what happened and then maybe
the
and it could be that the
row thing you think it's row
peggy noonan says she thinks the
january 6 trial is compelling well you
know compelling is the right word
um
famous jury
trial lawyer jerry spence wrote a book
called uh how to argue and win every
time i think and he was famous for
having never lost a trial
and i think he usually um
i think his client was usually suing
somebody for something horrible they did
and what are the explanations he gave
and this is really useful
like in the in in terms of persuasion
this was one you want to you want to
remember this right this is like right
at the top
and he used an example he said let's say
you're trying to sue a company
because your client uh the brakes of the
car didn't work
and your client had an accident now he's
suing the car company for making
defective breaks
if i describe it that way
and say look at my client he has these
terrible injuries
i can now prove that it was because of
the brakes and i can prove that your
company was behind it and you were
negligent therefore give my clients some
money
don't do that method
jerry spence would tell you that's a
losing argument
even if you could connect all the dots
there's my client
here's his medical bills
here's the breaks here's the proof that
you're behind it boom boom boom i win
right i got all the proof
not according to jerry spence
if it's a jury trial especially he says
the jury are basically emotional beasts
so here's how you would argue that trial
i'm going to paraphrase this argument
he's going to put you in the car
that's how you do it
they put the jury in the car not
physically mentally so jerry spence
would say
get up that morning you take a shower
it's going to be like any other day
it's a nice sunny day
you walk down to the driveway put your
key in the car
start it up
everything's like it always is
you're driving your familiar route
you're uh you can still smell the
aftershave on your face because you just
got ready
suddenly
you're going down a long steep hill
you start to fan the brakes a little bit
to slow down and they get a little soft
and you think
what's going on here and you hit them
again and they're still soft and you
realize
as you look down that hill
that everything you've worked for and
dreamed for
your entire life your kids
your wife
your life
your very safety
is now no longer in your hands
and that you are out of control going
down this hill over the embankment and
as you're going over the embankment and
you're feeling yourself literally in the
air and before your head is crashed
against a rock on the ground as you're
thrown from the car
and as you're laying there bleeding
your arms and tatters your pelvis has
been shattered
you say to yourself
what could have caused this
now i'm making this one up but that was
roughly the you know the argument that
jerry spence makes you need to put him
in the car put the jury in the car
mentally
now did you watch the
january 6
video
montage
that's what they did
they put the audience in the car
by splicing together all of the
video
and audio
and they put the audio of the um one of
the law enforcement piece people
pleading for help oh you know there's
too many of them we can't stop them or
something along this nature they put you
in the they put you in danger they put
you in
pence's uh little hidden hideaway there
right
now
why does one present it that way because
the facts won't sell it
that's why you do it
you do it that way
because the facts
won't sell it
if the facts won't sell it you put them
in the car
and that's what that's what the that's
what the nation just did we all got in
the car
and you can't really help it like if
they if they put together a good video
package or even if they just tell a good
story you can't help it you're in the
car
you know we're we're empathetic by
nature
so if you watch a movie you're in the
movie
right that's why you care about the
movie it just brings you in
so
when you feel yourself being manipulated
so heavy-handedly i mean this is just
hey hey everybody we're gonna manipulate
you now
so uh sit over there and we're just
gonna give you a bunch of emotional
stuff
and make sure that your critical
thinking is completely turned off how
about it and we all say
well that would be interesting
let's try that out and then we do it
um
well here's the good news
the good news is also bad news for some
of you so the supreme court's last
decision before they broke for the
recession was that
they would
they ruled that the biden administration
can end the trump
policy of remain in mexico so that's the
remain in mexico was working
in terms of slowing immigration illegal
immigration
but it's now been ruled uh that the
binding administration can end it
now here's the interesting thing it was
5'4 i think
and
it did not go the way conservatives want
it to go
so
hold on hold on
is it bad news
or did the court protect the system
i feel like the court protected the
system
the
and the system in this case is the
court's own independence
because it was sort of brilliant
that the last thing they ended on was
something that goes against conservative
popular opinion
the conservative court
ended the session with something that
clearly went against conservative
preferences
do you think that was an accident
do you think it was a coincidence
that the one that breaks the
breaks the
the frame is the last one
because you always talk about the last
one right
i think that was pretty clever
so i'm going to give i'm going to give
the supreme court some props
for first of all
i think they probably got the right
decision
because can you think of any reason that
the biden administration should be
prevented
from changing a rule that the trump
administration put in place
i mean i get that you don't like the
change
but can you see any constitutional
reason
why the new administration can't change
the rules
like
to me this is the right decision right
like obviously right you don't like it
i get that you don't like it but that's
what elections are for right
so it looks to me like it's another
situation where the court
just said we're not the right ones to do
this you know go do your democracy thing
or your republic thing
and go figure it out among the citizens
okay with me
so if you don't like that the biden
administration reverse that you've got
an option at the ballot box
so that's that's some pretty good
supreme court
wouldn't you say
how many how many people would give them
props for that even if
you don't like the decision
wouldn't you give them props for that
i mean seriously that you got to give
them credit for that one
it goes against their their own support
yeah now if this is going the other way
i would actually be worried
that would that would be cause for
concern
because you don't get you don't put a
you don't elect a conservative justice
to start making up right
the whole reason you want them in there
is that they're not going to make
up they're just going to say okay it's
either in the constitution or it's not
as best they can
yeah
all right
um
and then the this story
this is just one of the most annoying
thing about human beings especially in
the political context
so frida gitas tweeted this
uh that there's a leading american
neo-nazi
uh who's endorsed a candidate for the
senate
now
because i don't you some of you follow
the news already know who i'm talking
about it's not important
who it is he endorsed and i'm not going
to name it
because
i don't want to make it worse
there's nothing less legitimate
than getting some famous bad person to
endorse the person you don't like
all right
is so illegitimate
here are a few things you might not know
it's not very expensive to buy the
endorsement
of a neo-nazi blogger
now i'm not saying that happened
i'm saying that if you saw the the the
price sheet
for how much it would take to get him to
endorse anybody you wanted
it wouldn't be that expensive
again i'm not i'm not alleging anything
like that happened
i'm just saying that when you see this
sort of thing you should say to yourself
what would it cost to get him to say
that
and i can tell you from behind the
curtain without giving you any details
about anything i could tell you that
from behind the curtain the answer is
not very expensive
not very expensive at all
and
so whenever you see one of the the
neo-nazi racist guys
say anything or endorse anything that
gets your attention
ask yourself
what's their source of income right it's
just a sketchy group of people
but if we're going to use this method
of saying hey a neo-nazi endorsed this
candidate shouldn't we use it all the
time
wouldn't you like to know
which candidate has more backing by more
pedophiles
are there people who are for example
the people who would promote
uh dropping pedophile restrictions and
laws are there is there anybody who's
like an advocate for reducing pedophile
laws
who is also
democrat
democrat do you think
do you think you'd find any democrats
who
fall in that category and if we're going
to fall into this trap of
somebody you really don't like endorse
the candidate and therefore that should
bother you
there's no end to that
yeah there's no end
to the number of bad people who support
other people and
you wouldn't want to change that
it acts like it's a problem but it's not
a problem you'd want to change because
here's what i want
i want all of my neo-nazis to want low
taxes
is that wrong
i want the neo-nazis to like low taxes
you know they can like a candidate for
whatever their reasons are that's their
business that's not my business but if
they also like low taxes maybe i get a
candidate who likes low taxes
just a one example
and you know what's interesting about
this suppose we took it seriously
and like one of our big things was
let's say the next presidential election
of course there'll be some notable
neo-nazi
who supports one of the candidates i
think spencer
richard spencer i think he supported
democrats right so you've got one
notable racist who is you know
anti-democrat allegedly
so what would happen if we start using
this as our standard and say oh this
really matters there was this prominent
neo-nazi who preferred a candidate
wouldn't that let the neo-nazis pick
pick the president
because you could actually accidentally
have a system
where you have to vote for the person
that the neo-nazi doesn't like
which would give the neo-nazi the power
to decide who gets pres who becomes
president
[Laughter]
why doesn't the audacity get to decide
who's president
that that feels like a degrading the
system
once again
if you support the system
you should say yeah let the neo-nazis
support anybody they want
let the pedophiles do it
let everybody do it that's what that's
what the system is
but you know as soon as you're calling
out one neo-nazis endorsement
i think you've got to go further
if you're going to do that
let's see what the murderers want
let's see what the criminals want are
there more criminals who are democrats
by the way has anybody ever studied that
are there more criminals who are
democrats
i would think so just because they would
expect the democrats to be
soft on crime
i would
if i were a democrat
you know if i were a criminal i doubt
i'd be a republican
i mean odds are
um
all right
so
that ladies and gentlemen
i believe is the conclusion of the best
live stream you're ever going to see
today
with
coffee uh would anybody like to uh seal
this perfection with another sip yes you
would
that was rhetorical
all right
i think it's time to go have an amazing
day
there's uh all kinds of light out
because it's sort of the
most light of the season at least where
i live
and it's time
july 1st june is gone june is worth
worst month i hate it bye
i have a theory that june is the worst
month
have i ever told you that theory why
june is the worst month
it's the month of change
because you get into a routine during
the school year now this mostly affects
you know people with kids but i think
even the people have kids affect
everybody else because it's the dominant
culture
so
june is the time
when everything that had been going
smoothly
turns into a special case
so suddenly instead of driving the kids
to school every day which requires no
thinking
you have to figure out where you're all
going on vacation and nobody wants to go
to the same place and it's really hard
to figure out how to get there and
and the flights are being canceled and
blah blah blah june is when you have to
make too many decisions
june is when people break up
so you get all kinds of breakups in june
like relationships just
just die in june like i've had the worst
june luck
she was a bad month for relationships
and
yeah people get married there's all
kinds of change that that's the other
thing
there's a big complaint because the
pandemic
stopped a lot of marriages for a while
postponed them
people in people in their 20s and 30s
are just traveling for
you know weddings all the time and
spending all their money so everybody's
stressed out
because june is the month that
everything changes
the weather changes the school changes
people getting married vacations
everything
lots of hiring in june is that true well
for summer hiring yeah
[Laughter]
that can't be true all right here's
parody and reality
you can't tell the difference i'm
looking at a comment on youtube that
july is white history month
and when i first read i was like
is it
it took me a beat to realize that
couldn't possibly be true
so that was good
the reason that works is that for a
moment you're like
could it be
no it couldn't be it's impossible
according to jesse lee peters
jesse is amazing i love him jessie lee
peters
i i did an interview with him several
years ago in his studio
he has the most interesting
charisma
that you're going to see i don't know if
you watch his show
but in person he has the the warmest
like just most powerful
personal charisma that just it just like
engulfs you when you're there it's
one of the things about being a little
bit famous
is that i have more access to just
because of what i do
i meet meet other famous people
and
they are different
they are different not all of them
i mean
you know i can name a lot of people you
beat them and they're exactly like
everybody else is just
they're good at their job or something
but there are other people and jessie
lee peterson's one trump is another one
where you meet them and their their
charisma is truly different
like you would know
that whatever room you walked into
they're going to have an audience right
so you can definitely tell
what was it like meeting the front desk
guy at the white house well i didn't
really be the
any front desk guys um i was sort of
an invited guest so i had i had you know
assistance all the way through
oh i'm not up to date on jesse did he
get into some trouble
actually there wasn't a limo driver
either
i just took a cab
um well we don't know
okay
um
i love the story that trump tried to
strangle his own limo driver
that's something only democrats would
believe uh jesse has been accused of
being a closely gay or was that is that
really the story
is that the actual story
does anybody care
yeah who cares
who cares
you know i i don't think that
probably that that's the biggest
misunderstanding
that the left has about the right
care
you know we're so close
to being on the same page
because you've got the the democrats who
want to have
you know
lots of let's say freedom
and then there are the
the right
who who wants lots of don't care
sure
you can have freedom just don't let it
bother me
so
you know we're actually it's weirdly we
use different words for things but we're
a lot closer
we're a lot closer to just saying okay
let's just be americans
it's just we can't get there but it's so
close
the difference between the left and the
right
if you were willing to compromise
on can we just call ourselves americans
it'd all be over
if you think about it
because i you never see a a good
conversation between the left and the
right
you always see me
saying oh they're they're again
destroying a system to get a specific
you know goal or outcome
but have you ever seen me had that
conversation with a democrat
to say you know
i hear what you're saying and why you
would want this specific goal
but do you hear what i'm saying
that if you were to get this specific
goal the larger system would be so
damaged by it
that you might be unhappy in the long
run that you had gotten this specific
goal
you know and and would you can you
follow the logic
and what part of it would you disagree
with now isn't that the conversation you
wanna
you wanna hear
ben shapiro and bill maher
yeah you know
bill maher
he can see the whole field
with the exception of he's got some
trump derangement syndrome
that i think he came by honestly
meaning that he and trump had some
actual
personal issues prior to trump being
president
right i think they had some some kind of
head bashing there
so i feel as though
you know bill maher is your
highly uh
flexible mentally to be able to see the
whole field it's just he's got that
little blind spot that seems personal
but as long as you know it
you can you can discount that and look
at the other stuff it's
much more useful
all right
so i guess i'll have to go
read up on jesse let's see more comments
there
uh yeah trump and mar were feuding long
before the election
all right
um
and now
i'm going to say goodbye to youtube and
i'll see you tomorrow
thanks for joining
