[Applause]
hey everybody
come on in it's time time for scott
adams
and coffee coffee with scott adams
um i'm not gonna call you george
that doesn't make sense to any of you
who don't follow the news
but trust me today is gonna be a good
one
oh yeah you're gonna learn something
today i'm gonna give you a little
persuasion lesson tell you what the
president is doing right
and boy is he doing a lot right this
week
he's killing it good timing for it
but to enjoy this to its complete
and utter total capacity
all you need is a copper mugger glass a
tanker chalice or steiner
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind and fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
hit of the day
the uh thing that makes everything
better
the unparalleled pleasure it's called
this simultaneous step and it happens
now
go
ah well
here's the good news apparently there's
a
some kind of a meteor kind of a deal
called uh psych psyche
and nasa is planning to visit it
is it an asteroid or immediate it's an
asteroid i guess
and uh nasa is going to visit it in 2026
right around the corner but here's the
fun part about it
uh here's the value of the
the asteroid now given that it's made of
metal and it looks like nickel and
something else
and it's valuable metal and just to give
you
a just to give you a preview of what
it's worth
to mine these asteroids all right the
entire
global economy the gdp of the entire
earth
just to give you some comparison is 142
trillion dollars
all right that's the whole earth this uh
one asteroid is worth an estimated
ten thousand quadrillion dollars
quadrillion what the hell is a
quadrillion
is it four times a trillion
uh that doesn't sound right but when
you're talking 10 000
quadrillion that's some serious money
and it means that if elon musk
starts mining one of these asteroids
first elon musk could be
not just the first trillionaire
he could become the first
quadrillionaire
somebody says it's a thousand trillion
is a quadrillion which makes sense
makes a lot more sense than four
trillion all right
so that's how much money is up there in
space so if you think
elon musk and jeff bezos are crazy to
want to
start up some space operations
that's why somebody is going to be
a quadrillionaire you know how much you
can buy with a quadrillion dollars
nobody does
but the whole planet i guess so do you
think the democrats are starting to get
worried this week because they had a
good run
you know the polls were overwhelmingly
biden
favorable for months and months
but that seems to be tightening and
here's the thing
that i think democrats are starting to
notice
number one the supreme court
is pretty packed when you say now that
there's a
three-person majority of conservatives
on the court
because if he didn't hear amy coney
barrett got
sworn in yesterday so she's the new
member of the supreme court
and if you were a democrat
doesn't that take away your momentum for
voting
a little bit because it feels like it's
already too late
and the only thing you could do now is
pack the court
and sure there will be some democrats
who say yeah pack the court
but i think at least half of democrats
will say to themselves
uh won't that destroy the country
because it would it would
so a lot of democrats are going to say i
hate this
supreme court makeup but i don't want to
ruin the republic
uh aoc recently tweeted that it's
it's expand the court she doesn't want
to call it pack the court
expand the court and i tweeted back
that if you expand the court how do you
do that without
shrinking the republic because the
republic would no longer be
what it was designed to be which is you
know a division of power
separation of powers you would get rid
of that the moment you packed the court
the most important concept behind the
entire country and the constitution
would evaporate because whoever became
you know president and also had the
senate would just
pack the court again so you would have
packing and packing until you had
hundreds of people on the court
because why wouldn't you really why
wouldn't you
if if all it is is a power grab
you should expect that people would grab
the power but it's possible that the
court would never
you know never change again if democrats
got in power and packed the court maybe
they just
keep it that way all right
so first of all democrats at least half
of them probably have lost
a little incentive to vote because it's
already too late
for this nomination and they might not
want to pack the court because that
would destroy
everything but so that's i think
it but i also think it it trains the
democrats to accept
defeat meaning that this is a loss for
them
that there's another supreme court
nominee uh you know
uh judge who's conservative and losing
is something you can get used to
meaning that you start to expect it
so now you have this is the pattern
that's starting to form
you know democrats are worried about
2016
happening again and it feels exactly
like
it is and i'll talk about that in a
minute but they've got
that pattern in their mind okay 2016 oh
my god it's looking like that again
we lost before we might lose again and
we just lost on the supreme court
so you can you can train people to lose
when i used to play tennis there was a
phenomenon which
i think we all we all noticed if you
played a lot of tennis
that you could play somebody who seemed
relatively close to your level of skill
but sometimes one would just always win
and i think a lot of it has to do with
just expecting
you know the one who is used to winning
expects to win again
the one who is used to losing to this
very same opponent
just sort of gets used to losing and you
you can get into a mode
where your brain just causes you to lose
because you're sort of thinking that's
what's going to happen
and your your brain is guided toward
whatever you focus on
good or bad if you focus on bad stuff
happening your brain will
eventually in a million small ways guide
you toward that thing you are thinking
about
if you think about positive things your
brain will in a million ways
guide you subtly and nudge you towards
that positive thing
it's a pretty well understood phenomenon
so i wonder if the democrats
have a little little bit of the
the weight of losing in their minds
so that's a that's a thing now imagine
this
imagine you're a democrat and you wake
up every morning this week and you see
that president trump
is barnstorming all of the you know most
important electoral college locations
he's got gigantic rallies there's flags
there's
motion there's energy he's doing
everything right
he's reproducing his his technique from
2016 which we all
believe worked against hillary he
outworked her
he's doing it again and the champion
that you chose
to run against this force of nature
is decomposing in a darkened basement
while you watch trump do all of this how
does that make you feel
after you watch the supreme court go
away too
not good right but i don't think it
fires you up
i think it just it's a gut punch i think
it just takes everything out of you
if i had to guess you know i'm sure that
voting will be gigantic this year for
both democrats and republicans but
republicans don't have that
counterweight
republicans only have benefit
it's like oh i want more of this i'm
happy let's go get more of this
happiness
i'm celebrating let's celebrate some
more
that's pretty strong motivation whereas
the democrats
got a whole lot of weight on them
psychologically
and no joke this is a pretty serious
mental health issue very serious mental
health issue
and if we treat it like a joke we could
really get stung by it a lot of people
are going to get hurt
it's a real thing that people are in
psychic
emergency really i mean it's hard to
it's hard to overstate how bad this is
going to be for a lot of people's
psychological well-being it will be
funny
because let's let's be honest a lot of
you found a lot of entertainment
from 2016 and people screaming at the
sky
and and yeah i'm going to be honest i
wouldn't mind seeing it again
you know i can't be proud of it but i
wouldn't mind it all right
correct me if i'm wrong but and i might
be wrong about this
because i don't think i've considered
everything but it feels to me that a
hundred percent
of the signals are pointing toward trump
except the polls we all believe are
fraudulent
is that true i'll go through the list
and see if i left anything out
number one enthusiasm all trump
right so if you're looking at all the
intangibles that are not
part of the polling enthusiasm
trump signage trump
there's a some kind of statistic that
says that if you win the primaries
as a sitting president and you get over
75 percent of the votes
in the primaries as a sitting president
you win re-election almost every time
so trump of course crushed that uh
that measure he got way more than 75
percent so that
signals a victory trump is in roughly
the same place in the polls as he was
against
clinton actually maybe a little better
that signals victory
uh you see trump surging at the right
time
and you know doing his his heavy work
thing at the end
of the the cycle that strongly suggests
good things for trump new voter
registration i understand is heavily
republican
that signals trump ground game looks
better
because the biden people stayed home the
trump people knocked on doors
that signals trump biden isn't even
going to the right states
i guess he's going to
it's georgia he's not even trying um
so you got trump going to all the right
places you've got biden going to a place
that
sort of doesn't even make sense and he's
not even going to many places
you've seen the level of black support
for trump
which by itself if if there were no
other things you were looking at
and you just saw the level of black
support for trump uh
it's going through the roof that alone
would tell you he's going to get
reelected
now i know that he may have lost
suburban women
etc but i'll tell you this amy cody
barrett thing
has a lot of levels to it sure
the democrats don't like it because
she's conservative
but if you're a suburban woman
and you're watching amy coney barrett
are you
impressed even if you hate her politics
are you just impressed as hell just
about her as a human being as a
as a mother as a now a servant to the
public
impressive as hell and who nominated her
to the
supreme court a woman who looks like the
model of suburban women
trump i feel as though
trump is going to get some suburban
mother
appreciation for this pick even though
it was political
and even though she's conservative
there's something about it
that just feels like it's violating
whatever they thought about him
sexism or whatever so it counters that a
little bit
so he's got that going for him he's got
the incumbent
advantage in general incumbents normally
get elected no matter what
and like i said that the motivation of
packing the supreme court i think is
sort of split
on the democratic side whereas the
enthusiasm for trump
among republicans is
sky high it's sky high i just don't know
the democrats have that and of course
biden is decomposing and everybody can
see that
i think it was joe rogan who said this
on the kanye interview maybe
he he he had this great physical analogy
he said the voting for biden was like
uh going for a hike in the woods at
night
and you brought a flashlight with a
dying battery
and it probably won't work out well for
you
the the imagery of a flashlight with a
dying battery as you go into the woods
at night
is one of the all-time best you know
descriptions of that
all right let's talk about trump's
persuasion strategy i'm going to try to
do this without my camera
falling over let's do this and
bear with me for a moment as i'm going
to talk to my
amazon digital device you might want to
cover your device's ears for a moment
and it goes like this alexa
turn off studio
but uh just fixing the lighting so you
can see me worse but
my whiteboard's a little bit better so
trump is doing
his the same 2016 uh technique of going
to lots of rallies and getting a lot of
energy
and here are all the things he's doing
right so these are all
um persuasion techniques that are baked
into what he's doing
and it's it's really good it's like
really really
really good it's like a double plus good
let me run through it so first of all
he's setting up just
a deadly contrast because biden's
problem is he's looking sort of low
energy and he's hiding and he's in his
basement he's not doing much
so contrast is one of the most important
concepts in persuasion
the bigger the contrast the better and
trump has made the biggest contrast
you could ever achieve with the the
least
visible candidate of all time no doubt
about it
with the most visible candidate of all
time
highest energy versus lowest energy
bravest versus least brave
amazing contrast right now there's
always contrast but because he's
making us focus on it with these rallies
it just takes that contrast into a whole
new
new level there's a recency bias
meaning that whatever is happening at
the moment is more important to us than
anything that happened
last year and because time has become
distorted under the trump era
the recency bias is way more important
meaning that we don't remember what
happened two weeks ago
you know and if you're going to ask me
what happened in february
i think there was some kind of
impeachment
thing i don't know i don't remember that
was a long time ago
but i certainly remember what's
happening today
i know what's happening this week so by
trump
sucking up all of the news cycles with
these rallies which are nothing but
positive
it's just one positive funny celebration
after another
it's got flags and motion and energy and
all this stuff
that's his that's what he's putting in
your head
and that's what will be there recently
so the recency bias is all trump right
now he's doing nothing but positivity
and he's not only leaving it all on the
field
a phrase he actually used by the way
he's a happy warrior and the happy
warrior thing is a
perfect finisher it makes sense to
complain and be negative and scare
people
you know during the the build up to the
election but you need a
finisher you need a you need a frosting
on that cake
that that leaves people with a with a
good feeling toward the end
and man is he killing that he's just
killing it
he just you know from the from the point
of the last debate
where trump decided to go let's say
presidential
i hate to use that phrase because it's
somewhat subjective
but he decided to become more of a
presidential looking
tone it down kind of candidate and then
he brought positivity into the rallies
and it's just nothing but good news
and its recents was great he's taking
all the attention
of course because he's getting tons of
coverage especially when biden
is hiding he's got a social proof like
crazy going on social proof is that
we're all
influenced by people around us
especially people who are like us
so if you see if you turn on the rally
and you see all these people
for trump how different is that
from what you thought for the last four
years yes he's always done rallies
but couldn't you kind of write them off
as okay he just went to a place
that there were a lot of supporters but
what is it what does it do to your
impression of how
acceptable it is to support trump when
you see these rallies and many of them
are spontaneous
a lot of the a lot of the rallies if you
can call it that
don't even have trump you know the boat
rally there's no trump there they just
organized in rallies the truck rallies
no trump they just organized their own
rally
and when you see these spontaneous
gigantic
expressions of pro-trump and they're
happening all over the country in
different places at the same time
suddenly your thought that you can't
support trump
because you know he's sort of a monster
and everybody's saying bad stuff about
them
is is really affected by seeing all
these people who are okay
with vocally and publicly supporting
trump
it makes it easier for you it gives you
a fake
because in other words you could say to
yourself
well they can't be that bad if all these
people are willing to do all this
publicly so the social proof is gigantic
you've got a lot of flags involved with
trump
rallies the book pre-suasion
by cialdini talks about how
they some researchers did some tests
where they would show
images of the american flag to people
before they voted
and they found that if they show you the
flag before you vote
you're far more republican biased
in minutes we're talking about a change
that happens
almost right away so the american flag
makes you feel more
republican now i don't know why
you know it could be just the
republicans favor the flag more than
other people
but you see that many flags and all
these
rallies and of course the news is
covering it all that
persuades you it gets you in the mood
for republican voting
and it's and it is a measurable effect
and it's not me just talking crazy talk
it's been studied
specifically the flag and specifically
voting for
republicans that exact thing has been
studied
and he's killing it on that reciprocity
one of the most important concepts in
persuasion
that's why a salesperson will do you a
favor
might be a small one buy you some
tickets to the show or something
because once somebody does you a favor
you are automatically
wired to return the favor when you see
trump
working this hard to do something which
clearly is entertainment
he entertains at the rallies that's why
he does it
there's not like a lot of information
being
transmitted it's entertainment and when
you see how hard he's working
for the base what does that do to the
base
when somebody works hard for you you say
i gotta do something in return
and all he's asking me is to vote
that's it that's not even hard
so the reciprocity thing is gigantic
it's really powerful we owe him
a favor because he did so much to
entertain us to show up
to to get her energy up to get the
the policies that you wanted etc you owe
him
and he's working hard and you appreciate
that and you respect it
everybody responds to hard work it's
universal
you will like anybody who works hard in
fact you've
you've seen me model this actually when
i've
said good things about um aoc when i
said good things about
um oh who is the
uh actress who is very pro-biden
uh alyssa milano um i say good things
about both of them
although i disagree with their opinions
on just about
everything but they work hard
they put in the time they they do the
effort aoc with her wearing on her
her athletic footwear and
um with you know other people you just
see them putting in the hours
and that means something to me that
gives me some respect
energy of course is always uh persuasive
people are drawn to energy trump is
showing the energy like crazy
and you are just naturally drawn to it
especially
if somebody is trying to be a leader
pattern spotting
very important if you think there's a
pattern
and it influences you you will
subconsciously start
working toward that thing so
if you think that this year is going to
look like
2016 you don't know it will
but you suspect it you worry about it
you fret about it you think about it
it's the thinking about it that matters
and you're thinking about this 2016
pattern
where trump comes from behind in the
polls anyway
and and wins at the last moment what
does that do to you
well if if you're talking about what it
does to any one person
probably nothing they're just going to
vote whoever they're going to vote for
but remember we're talking about large
groups of people and you only have to
move
a little sliver of them to make a
difference in this election
and i believe that that that pattern
which is in all of our heads democrats
and republicans
will make republicans show up to satisfy
the pattern
and will make democrats who might have
been on the fence about whether it's
worth
voting or not worth voting maybe just
find something else to do that day
now if you ask them later hey did you
change your behavior
because of the 2016 pattern that's in
your head
everybody would say no they'd say no
what's that got to do with anything this
is this year i simply made a decision
that i wouldn't vote because i had this
important other thing i had to do
so that's the way it would play out in
people's heads but the
the effect would be you'd see you know
one percent some small percent
maybe one percent of the people would
just act a little differently
because that pattern is rolling around
in their head
i talked about the fake because watching
trump work so hard as contrast
to biden is just one more fake reason
you can give yourself to do the thing
you wanted to do
anyway and sometimes you need that to
just give you that little extra
nudge to get you off the fence people
wanted to vote
for trump but maybe they were concerned
about
this or that something that he did or
might do but then you see how hard he's
working
compared to biden and that gives you
another fake reason it's like ah
i gotta have the guy who works hard i
mean i'm hiring somebody you're
literally
hiring for all practical purposes an
employee
are you gonna hire the employee who
stays in this basement
it's like just a perfect reason if
people need a simple one
it's like well i don't understand all
these policies and i wouldn't know a
good trade deal from a bad one but
i can tell a hard worker from a not hard
worker
that's pretty easy to tell i mean i i
can see that
so that'll be my that'll be my reason um
the
trump rallies are insanely visual
and of course the the visual element is
the most persuasive
of of your senses it's more persuasive
than
a concept it's more persuasive than
hearing it
and man are they visual they're super
visual lots of red
you know that's a good visual color just
everything is visual about it
and of course trump transitioning into
happier
happy warrior mode just feels good
right when somebody is bringing you
optimism
makes you feel optimistic gives you a
little energy maybe enough energy to
show up and vote
so look at all the stuff that
trump is getting right with all this
stuff and look at the timing of it
perfectly time to peak at the right time
it's really good it's really good alexa
turn on studio
all right that's enough of that
let's talk about some more stuff um
you saw the video where joe biden
appeared to think that the president's
first name was george
did you see that and then there was some
follow-up
clarification that biden was actually in
an interview
with george lopez so george lopez
was a name that he was probably kicking
around in his mind
so when it looked like biden couldn't
remember the name of the president
it probably was still a mental hiccup
you know so it wasn't nothing but it was
less than you thought it was maybe
it was a little less than you thought it
was because it's not
that unusual to
confuse the name of the person you're
talking to with the person you're
thinking of is
is a little more ordinary so i will
accept that clarification that it really
wasn't about
george bush and he wasn't having some
senior moment about george bush but it
was still sort of a senior moment
right it's not nothing it's just
it's just a little bit less than the
what your first
impression was um
on fire at least some of it is uh
there's protests
not protests they're riots uh black
lives matter is rioting there because a
police
shot a man with a knife who was
attacking them
now he was an armed person who got shot
in the act of violence
and so there's a riot and looting
what does that do for the campaign
well as matt walsh tweeted
he said black lives matter is rioting in
philly because police shot a guy who was
charging at them with a knife
these buffoons didn't get the memo that
they're supposed to stop burning and
destroying stuff until the election
now they may have just handed
pennsylvania and the election
to trump i endorse every part of that
tweet
i think that's what happened because if
you're the
suburban uh family looking at this
it just scares you again and it's it's
all democrat related
so uh the democrats idea of
squashing that uh violence just before
the election didn't work out
um apparently trump back in 2018 i saw a
jack
possabic tweet on this uh he was
advocating for more mental health
institutions so that that would be
you know one small way to deal with uh
gun violence or other violence because
crazy people can get violent now it's
not the full answer to
gun violence of course but it started to
look
better and better isn't it a lot of
homeless people
they don't really have a homeless
problem so much as a mental health
problem
and i think we just have to get to the
place
where there are some citizens who just
can't live among the rest of them
would you agree with that i think we've
reached a problem
let me let me give you a uh a reframing
of what you see in society right now
and see if this works for you we have a
bunch of problems like you know homeless
and
people with mental health and we've got
you know lots of income disparity and
unemployment and lots of problems right
and you've got lots of people who've
gone through the prison system
and they can't get jobs there's there's
a whole
swath of civilization
that can't live with the rest of
civilization
but if you could find a place where they
could have their own life
away from the other people who just need
to get away from them
maybe that's the solution the problem
seems to be when you integrate
everybody in the same place because
an insane person could live happily you
know in some environment
a you know a person who has committed
crimes before
could probably live happily in some
environment but if you force them to
live
where they can't afford you know they
can't afford the rent
what are they going to do maybe steal
some stuff so i've got a feeling that
a lot of our problems in society are
this assumption
that everybody should live near
everybody else or wherever they want
and what we need and this is one of
kanye's innovations i think
because he's working on building you
know low-cost more livable
shelters etc kanye talks about how
space can rewire your brain
and i think he's onto something way
bigger than people
quite understand i would like to see
some kind of a
trial because you should test it small
where you try to see what you can do for
mental health
by building a physical environment where
the
physical environment is part of the cure
not cure let's say treatment because
imagine somebody's got a mental health
problem and it's pretty bad
and so you grab them and say you no
longer can live by yourself
i'm going to put you in a mental health
institution
is there anything that would be worse
for your mental health
than being in a mental health
institution which is basically
a bunch of square box whole you know
containers
with white walls i feel like that would
make you worse
whereas just take this as a suppose
suppose you took that same person and
you put them
in more of a nature surrounded living
environment
where they're they're outdoors as much
as they're indoors but they can't hurt
themselves
there are no there's no traffic you know
there's enough professionals watching
everything
i feel like you could heal people to
some extent or at least make it easier
to treat them
if you put them in an environment that
didn't suck
that feels like it's a much much bigger
thing than we're
giving it credit for because when
somebody has mental health or other
problems
they go to jail whatever you end up you
want to spend the least amount
because it's like oh we don't want to
raise our taxes let's let's make it the
cheapest thing
it's like cubicles if you take an
employee
and put them in a little box a cubicle
they don't perform the same
as if they're in a nice environment
because your environment programs you
that that's just a fact anyway i think
trump's on the right
path which is we need more facilities
but i would
object to building those facilities the
way we have in the past
i think you need more of a kanye level
design thinking about how to how to
approach this
um let's see
let's talk about uh uh
nexium so i hope some of you saw my uh
interview i did it's on youtube
with uh nikki klein who is involved with
nexium
and involves with dos the the separate
but a separate but you know venn diagram
uh crossover with nexium so it's the
same people from nexium some of them
formed this smaller group and their
leader
keith renery is being sentenced
today now what's interesting and i said
this before is that he didn't put
up a defense but apparently keith
renery will get to speak to the court
today
and i don't think the court has heard
from him because he didn't put on a
defense
now this is really interesting because
he's not like
regular people meaning that he has some
persuasion skills
which is what got him into this trouble
in the first place
that is not normal you know
and i'm really curious if we'll ever
know what he says in court
and whether it will make a difference
because typically
it's just a right or i don't know if
it's a right but
the fact that somebody says something in
open court doesn't really change
anything
does it has it ever changed anything
maybe
change a little bit the sentencing but
probably not
but that's normal people if you let
me talk to the court a trained
persuader there's a little higher chance
that something would come out of that a
little bit
you know even if it went through the
press before it changed something
so he might actually move the needle
and uh i'll tell you i would buy a
ticket to watch what he said to the
court
especially given that the claim is that
the
court that the trial process was rigged
or
had some irregularities in it that
should raise one of your eyebrows
through the roof
and there are definitely some
irregularities let me talk about some of
them
so i would i guess i would uh separate
all of the charges against
rineri which add up to possibly a life
sentence so this is how bad all of the
charges are
a life sentence is possible today
but there are three categories one has
to do with an underaged
uh girl a 15 year old girl we'll talk
about that
one has to do with a bunch of business
related
financial improprieties and something
with immigration etc
and then another has to do with some
kind of
sex trafficking coercion coercion
so three separate categories now the
ones with the
financial irregularities here's the
context
which you need to know pretty much any
small
business that was making a lot of money
and it was a private company
not a not a public corporation but a
private company making a lot of money
if you if the government decided to to
rip it apart and look at
everything look at every transaction
every bank account
check the immigration status of all the
employees
look at all your paperwork how many
crimes would you find
in the average law abiding
you think american small business
if you don't know this this might come
as a surprise to you
pretty much all small businesses in
america
are criminal organizations
now part of that is because they don't
know how
to satisfy all the laws
uh i used to own a couple of small
restaurants
i was in court twice or i went into a
court process let's say
twice for violating laws
that i didn't know existed
right that's how hard it is to obey the
law if you're a small
if you're a small business if you're a
small business you will violate laws
you didn't even know were laws if i now
i can't tell you what those
the two cases were because i had to you
know sign something that says i won't
ever talk about them
part of the reason the court i think
doesn't want you ever talk about them is
because it's embarrassing
because they shouldn't be laws in the
first place but two laws if i describe
to you
what the law was and then what we did as
a small business
you would say to yourself are you effing
kidding me
that was a law how could you possibly
have known you would even violated that
law
and by the way no victims
no victims in both cases
people were given what they wanted and
it broke the law
no no victims everybody got what they
wanted
no there was no fraud nobody was fooled
nobody was lied to there was nothing
sketchy
whatsoever and it violated two laws
and i had to settle in both cases
because the violation of the law was
perfectly clear
i just didn't know it existed nor did
anybody else associated with the
business
so the category of
you know those things suggests
that maybe there was let's say a
prejudice against
the organization that caused them to dig
deeper into
unrelated things because i don't think
they were originally
accused of all the crimes that they were
convicted of
i think that these were things that they
discovered in the process
of looking at other stuff i might be
wrong about that but i think that they
just
uncovered a bunch of stuff now the stuff
that they uncovered didn't seem to be
related to one big scheme
it was a bunch of individual things that
individual people
were involved with it didn't even look
like it came from the top
so in other words there's no suggestion
that
keith renery specifically was ordering
people to violate the law
either may have been some of that i
don't know but it was just
individual instances all right now i
think that if you do enough individual
instances of something that the law
doesn't like
they can call you racketeering in other
words they can say it's not one person
doing a bad thing
it's a group so it's maybe it's some
kind of a group
problem and that's bigger now you're
racketeering and
you know maybe you've got some ricoh
problems and everything else so you can
you can sum these things up to a bigger
thing all right then the other category
is let's talk about the underage girl
it's really hard to read any press
that gets into the details but there are
some things about this that don't make
any sense at all
so one of the major claims is that this
15 year old girl
and two siblings came to live
with the the nexium folks and it's
because their father
was a big fan of the program he went
through it and had a great result so he
wanted his children to benefit too
and so the parents said yeah go there
now
uh two of them were underage to the
females i guess
so here are the things that kind of
don't make sense in the story
you ready one of them is that
the uh the 15 year old was
imprisoned in one room with the windows
covered
and a mattress and a piece of paper that
she could only write letters to keith
renery
saying she was sorry or something i
don't know and
and that she stayed there for a year now
when you first hear that you say
okay he needs to go to jail he needs to
go to jail for a long time
because if you put a 15 year old in a
room and in prison
her or him for a year
you need to go to jail but then you read
another detail about it
here's the other detail it wasn't the
cult
that imprisoned her it was her family in
the house that the family lived in
so her family
made her stay in that room is that the
cult
i don't know it i mean you could maybe
say well the cult
forced the family to do it but this gets
me to the next question i'll talk about
this in a moment
so that that sort of doesn't make sense
because it feels like
if the family's doing it
isn't you know it's still bad but wasn't
that more the family
next there's a story that the older
sister the one who was older than 15
was getting a little flirty i guess when
she was 17
with keith the leader and that
when it started to look like it was
going to get physical
keith the leader said that she was under
18
and she was too young and so
they waited until after she was 18.
this was the sister of the 15 year old
who will come into the story again
but the story goes that he did sleep
or did have some kind of sex with the 15
year old
now does that story completely track to
you
that he would be telling one of the
sisters you have to wait until you're
18.
and obviously he was interested in her
because as soon as she was 18
they got busy so
does the person who is so concerned
about somebody not being a minor
suddenly not care about the other one
and then i guess the
the story given was that he said that
some people are more mature than other
people
but i believe that the evidence that
he had sexual relationship with the
younger one was hearsay
meaning that i don't believe that that
it came from anybody except
another witness meaning i think the
sister is the one who said
that the 15 year old told her and the
sister is the one that said that
keith said it but i don't know if they
have any direct evidence
meaning i don't know if keith said it
you know legally if he said it and i
don't know if the 15 year old
who is now much older she's in her late
20s i guess i don't know if she ever
said it
so these are just sort of questions i
have is like do you have
actually have evidence of this because
we've got two pieces of evidence that
don't
disprove it you know they certainly
don't disprove it
but they certainly raise some questions
and the press doesn't fill in those
blanks
so i got questions now let me say as
clearly as possible if anything happened
with the underage girl
the legal system needs to be involved
and whatever it comes up with
probably makes sense but
uh there does seem to be a strong
indication
that there's um maybe some kind of
vendetta going on here and that there
might be
some prejudice in the whole process
but let me give to get to the most
interesting part of this because it gets
into free will
so the the largest part of the uh
accusations are that he sort of
brainwashed
people into becoming sex slaves
and i feel as though there's a blind
spot here
and how you know the normal public looks
at this situation
because let me give you this example
let's say
let's say somebody came to you and said
um i've got this proposition for you
i would like you to be my my slave
and as part of that
that situation i would like to you to
give me
personal private information that will
guarantee
the privacy of this situation blackmail
if you will
now it's only it's only blackmail i
suppose if somebody used it and there's
no evidence that
in this in this uh nexium or in this
dos situation i should say there's no
evidence that anybody ever used any of
that blackmail
and indeed people people left the
organization
so there were people who left the
organization there's no
no penalty so we know that happened now
here's the question
if i say to you here's the deal you have
you have to give me this information
and then you would be treated as my
slave and let's say you agree to that
you agree to be a slave for whatever
reason
and you agree to give that private
information
and then later you decide that you have
to do what you're told
because you have agreed to the situation
where is the crime exactly
where's the crime because it'd be one
thing if somebody stole
black male information and then used it
against you but there's no indication
that happened it was all voluntary
so where does free will come into this
can a person not agree in this country
is it illegal to agree to be somebody
else's slave
and to give them private information
that of course could be dangerous later
why is that illegal now let's say
you did it with one person i'll bet that
wouldn't be illegal right
but suppose one person did it to lots of
people
let's say there was one person at the
top and lots of people
got involved well now it sounds like a
bigger problem right
but isn't it the same thing that wasn't
a problem just multiplied
there's more of it how many of these
people
enjoyed the situation from beginning to
end
including the part where they
voluntarily
accepted a brand how many people
were happy all the way through from the
moment they said yes
through all the process all the way to
the end
and and when it was a problem how many
of them said
why is this a problem i don't even
understand i voluntarily did this
i enjoyed every minute of it what
percentage of them said that
i don't know but i feel like probably
more of them
said they liked it and probably more of
them said well this is what i signed up
for
than there were who ultimately changed
their mind
so there obviously has to be something
more to this from a
legal perspective that turned that into
something
illegal but i suspect that sexism is a
really big part of this story
because imagine if you will that you
just reversed the genders
okay suppose there was a woman
on top of a a slave organization
and all the slaves were men
would that woman ever go to court
no no all you'd have to do is reverse
the genders
and nobody would even see a crime
because they would say
well men can make decisions and if a man
makes a decision to give you private
information
and a man makes a decision to act as
your slave
where's the bad where's the crime
so here here's here's the part that will
make your head explode
i hope it made my head explode it's
only a crime because wait for it
society doesn't imagine that women can
make up their own
minds that's it
i think this whole thing got hyper
criminalized
because society doesn't think women have
agency over their own decisions
and that they can be manipulated by this
svengali you know guru
but if you reverse the genders nobody
would say that about a man
they would just say well you dumbass you
gotta
enjoy your brand dumbass you had it
coming
nobody would give a if you reversed
the genders that's important
now if i were going to argue this case
and i were the defense attorney
i would go and write for that and the
and i think that the
uh the jury trial what is that um
you're right if the genders had been
reversed
we wouldn't have had any problem with it
at all
i see in the comments somebody viewer uh
agreeing so the reason that i talk about
this i see some of you are uncomfortable
with the topic and saying move on
get away from this topic the reason that
this is relevant to everything else is
persuasion and free will
these are my primary topics when i talk
about
uh politics it's generally through that
filter
um somebody says they're uncomfortable
with how stupid this
is is it see here's here's your blind
spot
the blind spot is this you believe that
the people who signed up as slaves
were coerced right
that's really the nature of the the
thing you believe they were coerced
now you're thinking yourself well they
were manipulated
so it they feel like they made their own
decisions
but did they they were manipulated into
making those decisions
but again you wouldn't have said this if
it were men
all right um let's keep an eye on this
there will be more news about this oh
let me give you one update that you'll
like
so i was reading up on this cnn had an
article and in cnn
they mentioned nikki klein who i
interviewed on youtube
who was a member and they said that they
contacted nikki klein
for a comment and she declined
to comment and so
i texted nikki klein and said cnn
says you declined to comment which
seemed
not necessarily true to me because
she wants to she wants public attention
why would you decline to comment if you
are
actively engaged in trying to get
attention for your point of view
and so i said did you decline to comment
for cnn
what do you think she said no she
invited them
to join the protest and cover it which
is where she is right now at the
courthouse
as part of a protest during the hearings
so cnn
the the one thing i could check wasn't
true
all right so just just hold this in mind
you i talk about the
gel man amnesia all the time where if
you know about a story
you can tell all the things that are
wrong about it but if you don't have any
of your own information about a story
it looks real to you i mean you say well
it's in the news
it's probably true but as soon as you
know anything about it you know it's not
true
what did i know about this story
nothing i took a guess on
one fact in a larger body of a story
i just took a guess and i said i'll bet
this fact isn't true
picked up my phone and learned it wasn't
true
in less than 30 seconds
right i mean that's that's the world you
live in right
so let me say i don't believe any of the
reporting about this nexium stuff
if it turns out the underage girl stuff
is true
then keith deserves some prison time
i'm sure but the rest of the stuff
it's really sketchy it's really sketchy
and uh i think probably it needs to be
addressed in some way all right
that's enough for now and i will talk to
you all
tomorrow
you
