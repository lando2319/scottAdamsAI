good morning everybody
and welcome
to what will no doubt be a thing you
remember all of your life you'll
probably you'll probably always remember
where you were when this coffee with
scott adams happened
you'll say to yourself i was where i
always am now
probably you're either always exercising
or drinking coffee or getting ready for
work or you're at work or something
probably the same thing every time and
that's what i call a good habit
but
would you like to take this up a level
yeah
yeah i can see it in your eyes you're
the kind of people who don't settle
for second best and all you need is a
copper mugler glasses tanker cellos or
steiner canteen jug or flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better it's going to kick off your day
like nothing ever has before i can't
believe that the excitement is building
i can hardly stand it go
yeah it lived up to its
hype
how
tired of you of things that don't live
up to their hype
but this
matched it perfectly
well i did a little uh unscientific poll
because i've been trying to figure
something out for a long time but i
think i got i think i got my answer
it goes like this
what percentage of the time
do you go to starbucks
for those of you who do and before i say
this hold on don't answer yet don't
answer
do not comment yet do not
there's one kind of comment you're not
allowed to make
you cannot say
i don't go to starbucks
and then give you a reason
you can't say that
because if you do you're identifying
yourself as an npc
because it's the most obvious thing to
say
when i talk about starbucks
what's the most obvious thing to say
if i talk about a television show
i don't have a tv anymore
no i got rid of my tv
don't say that
never say you got rid of your tv when
somebody talks about tv show never say
you don't go to starbucks when somebody
talks about starbucks
because it's the most obvious thing you
can say
so don't do that
so i went to starbucks the other day and
like like often happens
i ordered my complicated drink just by
reading it off the top nothing special i
just ordered one of their drinks but it
happens to have lots of words in it
i don't remember them every time so i
have to read them off the sign when i'm
ordering it how often do they give me
what i ordered
go
what what do you think is the percentage
of time
i order the i order the same thing every
day
it's it's
amazingly
not very reliable
and i i get obsessed by user interfaces
as sort of a hobby because my my user
interface
experience i used to work in a group
that tested user interfaces
and once you get it in your head you see
everything through that filter
and once you become a user interface
person you just see bad interfaces
everywhere let me tell you what you what
starbucks does wrong
and then i'm going to surprise you at
the end
by telling you that everything they do
wrong
is actually cleverly right
so wait for the reveal okay so here's
what they do wrong
my big complicated drink
is on a sign
with other drinks
also many of them complicated
the the longest one with the most words
is right next to the other one with the
most words
and i think there are maybe one or two
words are different but otherwise
they're similar
how often do they give me the other one
well here's the problem
the starbuck the starbucks baristas
are so sick of hearing you say that
whole sentence
that they'll start typing in the order
before you're done talking
and so i'll say
give me the uh double half calf double
luck light venti single strap whatever i
have no idea what they are
and the guy will hear the first two
words you'll go okay okay i got it
but the two first two words are the same
or they sound the same or he thinks
they're the same
so usually they're typing in the wrong
order while you're saying the right
order
then
only sometimes do they remember to ask
for the size
because they usually type it in wrong
until you like force them to put it in
right
my my ratio is about
25 failure
i order the same drink
at different starbucks the one closest
to me has the best uh best record
but the ones you know just a little bit
of a drive nothing
so
and now now i ask myself is this just
because i'm ordering something
complicated so i did the poll
the most common answer to the poll was
i don't order anything but black coffee
because i'm afraid they'll get it wrong
because they always get it wrong or they
get it wrong so much that you don't want
to take the chance how many of you do
the same thing you go to starbucks and
you just say
black
coffee
and then you give your size
maybe maybe you say room for cream or
something and do you do it specifically
because you know they're not going to
get your order right and you don't want
to go through the process
right it's so common
now let me ask you this do you think
this starbucks is unaware
of how often they get your order wrong
do you think there's any chance they
don't know that
of course they know that
if you stand in the store for five
minutes how many people who are picking
up their drink are complaining they got
the wrong thing
have you ever have you ever stayed in
starbucks for more than five minutes
there's always somebody complaining they
got the wrong thing in any five minute
slice somebody got the wrong drink
you could stand there all day long and
every five minute slice would be
somebody say oh
i thought i ordered the big one
so here's my uh reveal
so my first thought was how in the world
could
such a capable company make such a bad
mistake
over and over and over again
do you know and do you know what the
reveal is do you know what the reason is
it causes addiction
what's the one thing you say about
starbucks if you have the habit you're
addicted
and i can feel it i don't go to
starbucks just because i like the
experience
or the product i actually feel addicted
and it happens pretty quickly
and here's the the big
the big interesting part
believe it or not i'm getting to an
interesting part
science knows
that if if starbucks gave you exactly
what you wanted every time
you would like it less
i know doesn't make sense but if you got
exactly what you ordered every time
for many of you i mean people are
different
for many of you it would make you
addicted and that's what it did to me
the fact that i can't guarantee i'm
going to get what i order
makes me obsessed by it
so i think about it all the time it's
like ah they're not going to give me the
right order
yesterday i went into starbucks and i
said to myself i'm going to order the
right thing
and i know this is gonna give me
the wrong thing
so ordered the right thing i think i
mean could have been my fault as well
don't know
and then
i received the wrong thing
after waiting ten minutes or whatever it
was five minutes
now was i going to get back in line
was i going to get back in line and
reorder the right thing because i didn't
have any confidence that i would get it
the second time either
so
i simply gave it back to them and said
you know i ordered the wrong thing
just put it on myself
i took my banana bread that they had
already given me
which i only wanted to have with the
drink
and i just threw that away
and i gave them the drink back and said
you could pour this out
so i left
but there was another starbucks on my
way home because i was coming from
something
i thought i'll just go to the other
starbucks
2 30 in the afternoon
i pull up to the other starbucks and
there's a sign on the door we decided to
close at 2 30 today
not the regular hours
it's the third time
it's the third time
i've gone to that starbucks this
specific one and they've been closed for
some god-nosed reason in the middle of
the afternoon
how often do starbucks just close in the
middle of the day
is that a thing in the middle of the
afternoon they just close
because that one's closed at least three
times that i'm aware of
now
how much do i want to go back to
starbucks today
after this horrible experience and by
the way i never got my starbucks
yesterday which cost me a day of work
because i i've got my routine down that
i only write on my book
when i've got that specific drink in the
starbucks experience i actually lost a
day of work
i hate starbucks now
i'm so mad at them
do you know how they can fix this
problem
that big sign with all the menu choices
just say number six
you right it's obvious it's obvious now
when you see how obvious it is
how completely obvious it is
to fix it
you know it's you know it's intentional
it's so easy to fix and so obvious how
you would fix it you just put numbers
next to them it's a number 25 boop boop
got it right every time do you know what
mcdonald's does
mcdonald's runs their store so you get
the same thing every time and you can
depend on it they just simplify till the
point where it's so hard to make a
mistake it doesn't happen a lot
and that's another experience that
people like
if you run a restaurant you also find
that people get addicted to consistency
is one of the things they really really
like those of you who are ordering only
the black coffee
as starbucks because you don't want to
take a chance that they'll get it wrong
that's who mcdonald's is catering to
because there's a certain personality
who just can't stand not getting the
same experience every time
and then there's one like mine
where i also can't stand it
but it makes me addicted
because i can't give it up either so
there are there are two different kinds
of people
all right
i thought that was useful uh
just to understand how addiction works
addiction's not about getting what you
want it's about not quite being sure if
you're going to get what you want
there's a
interesting article in forbes about the
ukrainian counter-offensive and there's
some claims in here that again is fog of
war
so anything i say about ukraine you
should be repeating to yourself while i
say it
that might not be true
okay
so you don't have to tell me that maybe
i'm falling for ukrainian propaganda i
know
maybe i'm falling for russian propaganda
i know
i know it's the best we can do
but anyway forbes has an article that
that suggests
some really interesting things that i
didn't know if if they're all true
um that the way ukraine made
their counter-offensive work
is that
when nobody thought that they had enough
power to mount any counter-offensive at
all
apparently they had enough power to
mount too
so they did a decoy offensive in the
north
so russia would move their forces up
there but it was a real offensive it was
big enough to be
serious but it wasn't their main thrust
their main thrust was in the south
and
and there
even there there were pockets where the
russian forces would be superior
so what the ukrainians did is they they
had
reportedly right so we don't know
anything for sure reportedly they formed
fast-moving mobile units
without much air support or any air
support i think
um and they quickly entered the russian
territory and they attacked their
weakest places
now keep in mind that they had already
taken out command and control as as best
they could
so it's not clear what kind of
communications the russian military had
when the war when the fighting started
but they took out the weak ones
so you get the weak ones retreating
you ignore the strong ones
until the strong ones look like a route
they say oh my god
it looks like we're getting routed
and then you let the strong ones retreat
so you leave them a path
so that's part of the strategy if you
trap the strongest forces they'd have to
fight their way out
you don't want to take those losses even
if you would win you don't want to take
those losses
so they they give them a retreat because
really they want the land more than they
need to defeat the military
so that was
that was allegedly
you don't have to tell me it might be
fiction
we all understand that now right
so when ukraine stories all have to be
grain of soul
but it's
it's a theory that sounds right enough
now this was part of a large argument
that tanks actually have been very
useful in this war
i think that's a yes or no
but they still do seem to have a major
component in war still
however and i think the ukrainians use
tanks as part of this counter-offensive
um
so that that's part of it but
something else that forbes said was that
their estimate was that uh russia had
lost maybe uh 20 000 killed and perhaps
60 000 wounded
now that sounds like a lot right
60 000
wounded and then here's the payoff
uh the initial number of forces from the
russian army entirely was a hundred and
twenty thousand
if it's true that sixty thousand people
have been injured and of an entire
military force
that's only twice that size
50 percent casualties
could that be true
in what
in what other war has um let's say a
modern war is there a modern war
not a battle
but a war
all right not an individual battle but a
whole war is there a modern war
where the winning team lost at 50
casualties
it doesn't sound like it could be true
does it
but if it is true
it sounds a little doubtful to me
actually pretty doubtful
but
if it were true that would explain
everything wouldn't it
you would only need
yeah you there probably are some
historical examples but you would only
need
that one fact to be true
and then everything else about ukraine
makes sense right
if it's true
that half of the russian soldiers have
been injured
it is also true for sure
if that's true we don't know
if that's true it's definitely true that
the russian forces are completely
demoralized
would you agree
if 50 of them have been injured they are
completely demoralized because they're
not fighting for anything
if they were fighting for their country
50 losses might just make them pissed
off
am i right
imagine america gets attacked
well no that's the wrong analogy ameri
imagine america is attacking uh canada
or something
if we're losing 50 of our forces
we're probably going to
pull them back
but if canada
attacked the united states
and we lost 50 of our forces
we'd just say you you're gonna have
to take them all
like we're going to fight to the last
person
so i don't see the russians losing you
know having 50 casualties they didn't
lose them they're just wounded
and
still having the the will to fight
so i think the ukrainians are
doing a strategy of attacking the weaker
russian forces as obviously one would
and getting them to scurry around and
create bad morale so that the stronger
forces
don't have enough support to do what
they do
it looks like it might work
now of course
putin will have to
he said he's in no hurry
you know there's no rush
i don't believe that for a minute
do you believe that russia doesn't feel
like there's any any hurry
they can just stay there and grind away
until they get what they want
i feel like they probably feel some
pressure now
i don't think that's true that they're
not in a hurry
anyway so that's what it looks like in
ukraine
it's now been how many weeks has it been
since russia has not mounted a
successful
offensive or defensive attack
or at least not one of scale
now it feels like
it feels like we could predict the end
of that war now anyway
um
we've reached this weird period in
history
where
people are openly saying they don't care
if what they're saying is true
which is very different than how it's
been it feels like just the last year
that happened
um you all remember the story of sam
harris
you know saying that
he wasn't so upset that the media hit
the
hunter laptop story because
maybe that helped keep a dictator out of
office
or something like that
but here uh joel pollock is reporting in
breitbart about
this guy greenblatt so i guess he's the
head of the adl
and he participated in this week's unity
summit at the white house
and
he was asked by jake turks who's a white
house correspondent for the orthodox
jewish magazine
army
now keep in mind
that this is jake turks
right
so
orthodox jewish
correspondent
so the orthodox jewish correspondent
said
he asked the greenblatt whether it was
in good faith for the president biden to
attempt to unify the country while using
a divisive hoax that had been widely
debunked meaning that charlottesville
fined people oaks
remember the people marching in
charlottesville were chanting
you know
anti-semitic things
and here's a jewish correspondent
orthodox jewish correspondent who even
he knows
that
the fine people part of it was a hoax
now obviously he knows the nazis were
real
but the people who were lumped in with
him the so-called fine people
he knows that parts was a hoax
so he asked this guy
how can you be at a unity summit
and present basically a hoax
a divisive hoax
and what do you think greenblatt said
when confronted with the fact
that it's obviously hoax it's widely
debunked and yet it's still part of the
package what do you think he said
he basically defended lying
yeah i mean
i'm
summarizing it in a way that he
definitely would not
so he would not agree with my
characterization of it but if you read
his answer it looks like he said
basically it doesn't matter
because what he did was he blamed trump
for being a poor
communicator that allowed that to happen
so in other words he blamed trump
for the fact that there was a
incorrect hoax about him
and that the democrats can still use
that incorrect hoax
and greenblatt argued that
if trump was a better communicator they
wouldn't be able to use that hoax
against them so it's his own damn fault
now again
i don't think he would agree with my
characterization of his opinion
but that's how it read
in other words that's how i received it
as did other people read it
and i i feel like this is the beginning
of a trend
where people are actually completely
willing to admit that the arguments
they're using are not real
and they're still saying yeah the
argument's not real
but i really really want to win because
winning's good too
it's never been so overt i mean in the
past people would really like
they'd go to the grave
defending the thing they were saying but
now people don't feel the need to even
even be honest about it
for example
today in the news
um
well you know once you lose
any sense that reason that logic and
data matter what are you left with
well we're left with
different ways to compare the other side
to hitler
and that's it
all of america politics is now boiled
down to
who can make a more convincing case
that the other side reminds you of
hitler more
and here's the weird part the reminding
of
no longer is connected to what they
might actually do
it used to be maybe
but isn't now
now i don't think it even matters
what the republicans or the democrats
would do
it only matters if you can make the
argument that it reminds me
it reminds me a little bit more of a
hitler thing for example
on social media today
uh there are pictures of the the mega
crowd
holding one finger up in the air
i'm not going to do the sign
because i've learned that as a white man
in america if you don't know this this
is very important let me give you a
lesson
i'll have to stand up for this
very important lesson if i could give
this to you
as a white man in america
you're not allowed to lift your arms
above here
for any reason
if somebody asks you to reach for
something on a high shelf for them and
you're the tall one
don't just lift your one arm up and
because they're going to take a picture
of it and then
who's hillary then
you are right
so instead if somebody says can you
reach that on the high shelf there's
only one way to do it safely you ready
you have to use both hands they have to
move into unison
got it
here you go
very important
if you start using the one hand
whoa
that was close
keep them here
now this advice by the way
is not only for
avoiding being called the nazi this also
applies to dancing
you know that right if you're if you're
a white man
i learned this a long time ago you can't
keep your arms up when you're dancing so
you don't want to be this
this this is not good white band dancing
the the woman who's dancing with you
will uh say you know i need a drink i
think i'm gonna go to the bar i'm done
dancing now
so i learned that if you're a white guy
you need to keep your arms low like this
when you're dancing
and nobody's really looking at your feet
so you just got to be doing this
like that
so it's very important
very important if you're a white man in
america never never
raise your arms above your chest
unless it's both of them
that's how you stay out of trouble
well who else looks like hitler i saw a
picture of john bon jovi's audience with
her arms in the air and
i
i trusted john bon jovi until i saw that
he turned his entire audience into
hitler's
yeah and do you remember
a long time ago when something would get
debunked
and then it would be embarrassing to
talk about it because people would laugh
at you they'd be like
poor bastard is the last person that
doesn't know that that's been debunked
oh you idiot you don't know what's been
debunked
but if you notice now that things can be
completely debunked
and people will just still say them like
it never happened
and i've been doing this on social media
as like a weird little psychological
experiment
i told you the other day
somebody said well you can't prove your
claim and then they showed a link that
absolutely proved it i mean proved it
beyond a shadow of a doubt
and the people who said you can't prove
it just kept going
like it didn't happen
it's the weirdest thing it's like a
social media phenomenon you see you've
seen it a lot
all right uh
so there's a group as you know called uh
they like to call themselves blacks for
trump
and at the rally last night there was a
handful of blacks for trump so-called
little signs that say blacks or jump
and there's one photo and remember you
can't trust a photo
right you can't trust that any photo is
real
or even that it was taken at the right
in the same place
at the time that they said it was or any
of that
so you can't trust photos and you can't
trust the people in the photos or even
who they say they are they might be
pretending to be somebody else
but there's a photo on social media of
allegedly
at the
must have been at the
trump rally yesterday
there were the blacks for trump were
there and then there were a bunch of
white looking guys
doing the
uh the okay hand signal
and then all the democrats say see
see all those racists in there now what
do you all say
what do you all say
you all say
oh my god the okay sign is just an okay
sign right
and then you say
but then you but then you look at the
picture and you can see that they
weren't making just an okay sign
right if you look at the picture
it's very obvious they weren't making an
okay sign okay that part you can rule
out
but you say to me scott scott
you don't know this was a 4chan prank
4chan made the prank that the okay
symbol was a white supremacist thing
and so it's a prank
to which i say
yeah it is a prank
by
so by racist
so it's sort of like a
it's hard to explain
because it's so on the nose
the racists themselves
do that okay signal in photographs
partly as a prank
but also because they are racist
they're not not racist
the only people who do that are the
races
now i have to tell you that i did save a
friend
who was about to post a picture of
himself
standing with somebody who did that
prank on him
i you know i saved him in time because
he didn't realize that that the prank
was being played on him
now
i would never take my picture with a
random group of mega supporters
because one of those is going to
do that
right
now
i'm not blaming mega people obviously
obviously this is not about maga people
but if you put 15 random
people from a trump rally behind me one
of those is going to
make that sign
so that you know so that i have a
problem the next time it shows up in a
photograph right
now it is a funny prank
i'm pro-prank right so i have to be
consistent because i i play pranks on
people so i'm gonna be consistent and
say it is kind of funny
it is funny
all right it's not that i don't laugh at
it
i just don't want it to happen to me
right
but
don't fool yourself
is there anybody here who would disagree
with the following statement
uh a large trump rally
will pretty much always attract some
actual racists
somebody disagree with that
a trump rally if it's big enough
will guarantee it
attract some
some
total raises
now
how about this
a
a democrat rally if it's a big enough
size
true or false
will attract some pedophiles
if it's a big enough crowd true or false
yeah every time
every time
does that mean that
[Music]
democrats are the
party of pedophiles
well yes it does but that's a
coincidence
and it's not because a few of them
showed up at a rally
right
i'm just kidding
sort of
uh
[Laughter]
okay
is it possible to get past the idea
that the supporter defines the leader
and if the supporters define the leader
which supporters get to do it
is it the ones who are not racist or the
ones who are
who gets to define who the leader is
and
and can we get to the point where we
could be a little bit realistic
that most people suck but in different
ways
sure you're not a pedophile but
probably did something i don't like
yeah sure maybe you're not a racist but
you probably did something i don't like
right
any large group of americans is filled
with
bastards and suckers and
and criminals and pedophiles and
murderers and you know perverts and
communists
that's who we are
that's basically who we are
right you got your problem i got mine it
might be different
right
[Laughter]
so one of the things i've always liked
about trump and correct me if i'm wrong
but his supporters always look like a
pirate ship
don't they
i've always i have never lost that
that uh image of all trump supporters
being on a pirate ship
because
he doesn't say you know yes no by you
know race or ethnicity or any of that
he just likes pirates
[Laughter]
am i right he just likes pirates
and i i have to admit i kind of like
pirates too you know in the metaphorical
sense
that
if you look at the people who support
trump
it is a grab bag of all kinds of
different backgrounds and they're not
all savory
some of them are pretty unsavory
but the fact that he appeals to the
unsavory as well as
in some cases the savory is part of a
feature that's not a that's not a flaw
that's a feature
i like the fact that he's open to
anybody who likes him
[Laughter]
you think that that just be a a terrible
like ego flaw
but i don't think so
i don't think so i i think if you're
talking about
you know being a leader of americans
being able to appreciate
the entire pirate ship of america
to me that seems like a plus
but if you get on the pirate ship and
you say all right that pirates are
deplorable
uh that pirate's non-binary i like that
one i like that one
i mean if you start sorting the pirates
into good pirates and bad pirates
you're a up leader
if you get on the pirate ship and you
say all right pirates we're all in this
together
let's go let's go get some booty but
we'll share it
then that makes a lot more sense i don't
mind being on that pirate ship
um
fentanyl so um
as requested
i'd ask for uh
machiavelli's underbelly to have ai
produce a list or produce an art of a
rendering of a pile of dead bodies
300 of them so we can show how many die
every day from fentanyl overdoses
and so i've
been retweeting those every morning
but i wondered if you were to pile the
corpses one on top of the other
lying flat so not not standing up
because of corpses right
laying flat so how tall would the
average corpse body be
somewhat like
not quite a foot right depends how fat
you are
but maybe you know six inches to a foot
something like that let's say a foot
and let's say if you piled all the dead
overdose fentanyl people one on top of
the other
it would be
just in rough numbers
about two hundred thousand feet high
because that's about how many people
died times one foot
about two hundred thousand
do you know what the biggest building in
america is do you know how high
the biggest one
it's under 2 000 feet
so the the corpses even put flat flat on
top of each other piled high would be 10
times higher
than the highest skyscraper in the
united states
that's just the people killed with
fentanyl overdoses thanks to china and
the cartels
there isn't any chance we're not going
to war with with mexico
there's no way that doesn't happen
i mean i don't know how many people have
to die in a specific manner
but at some point
there's going to be a trip
you know but like it doesn't look like
it's going to happen gradually does it
i don't think one day we're you know i
don't think we're going to like build up
to war with mexico
i feel like you know if we have a
republican president probably that's the
only way it gets done i think someday
you're just going to wake up to find out
there's been a massive military campaign
in mexico
and you'll find out about it after after
it starts
your nephew and your niece died from
fentanyl i'm sorry
join the club
so
um
but does that blow you away
that the pile of dead bodies would be
200
000 feet tall because that's how many
people have died
so maybe making a visual makes a
difference
that this statistic alone does not
well today was a sort of a weird day
and it seemed like the new the news only
had one theme today
which is who is more like hitler and i
think we should just use that standard
for everything
we should just give up on thinking
if you go to the store let's go back to
my starbucks example
rather than reading off that long menu
what i want to do is when they say how
can i help you what would you like
i want to say to the barista
can you tell me which of your
drinks is least like hitler because
these look a lot like hitler to me
and then i'll make them defend
their drinks
until they give me the one that is least
like hitler
which i assume would be a black coffee
and i'll be happy and they'll be happy
but i no longer want to think about
nutrition and
caffeine and sugar
none of that complexity
is making me happy
i just want to know which starbucks
drink is the most like hiller and the
least like killer so i can have the one
that's the least like hitler now when if
you're shopping for a new pet
do you just say oh this one's cute or
this one seems to like me that's the
wrong way to go about it
you should choose the pet that's the
least like hitler just like every other
decision in your life
just the least like killer and you'll
get yourself a good pet
if you go to dinner
order the special that's least like
hitler
there's nothing this works for
everything
there's no conversation where you can't
do the least like hitler
and especially in politics
i don't think there was a a single
 story in the news today there
wasn't some echo of what's more like
hitler
now how often do i have to tell you
that if you're arguing about problems
that aren't real
you're in pretty good shape
and we've sort of we've
we've devolved into an imaginary world
where we enter to to just talk about
politics
in the real world
we're somewhat
somewhat aware
that the things we say aren't real
so we enter this imaginary world where
you can just say any damn thing and
compare it to hitler and everybody's
happy
what about the oil news what about it
um
i can't take the fake news
well here's the thing
what problems are unsolvable right now
what are our unsolvable problems
because it looks to me i think we're
going to be fine on climate change
you know with friction it's not going to
be easy but we'll be fine
the the one that
and by the and by the way i i don't know
this is a
related topic
but when i i tweeted the other day that
republicans believe them you make money
by hard work and intelligent risk-taking
and then i said that democrats seem to
think all the money that's ever been
made
already exists
but somebody has their share they need
to go get it back
and
some people tweeted at me and said
that's not how money is made money is
made by the fed
they just increase the money supply
what do you think of that answer
the money
is simply made out of nothing
and therefore the democrats are a little
bit right
because money got made out of nothing
and
where's their share if you're going to
make money out of nothing why don't they
get something
what's wrong with that
what's wrong with that point
you're saying it's done but say why
yeah money is debt exactly that money is
somebody's debt
it didn't just come out of nothing
somebody had an equal amount of debt
or except for in the case of you just
increasing the money supply i suppose
uh then then you're
you're giving people inflation which is
a form of
expense or debt i suppose
yeah
so
but i actually saw people suggest
that money was free
that you could actually just make some
more and then you could give everybody
some because that's exactly what we did
in the pandemic
we made more money and then we just
handed it out and then people who didn't
have it had money
for a while
and i think the democrats came to
believe that well why don't you just
keep doing that
there's no limit to that is there
you know because if you had asked me
what the limit was of how much you could
run up the debt
i would have said well the limit is
probably
1 trillion
what are we up to
what's our debt now 20 trillion or
something
30 trillion or 30 trillion i would have
said 1 trillion is too much
what would you have said
and if you told me we could still be
functioning
and people still you know do business
and they still get loans with a 30
trillion dollar debt i always said
that's crazy
that the whole system can't possibly
support
30 trillion dollars in debt
but it is
i don't know why
and i don't know if anybody knows why
that's the weird thing
i'm not entirely sure
that there's anybody anywhere who knows
why the economy is working
let me say that again i don't believe
there's any economist at any level
anywhere
who could explain to you why the economy
is still functioning right now
because it shouldn't
it shouldn't
everything we know about everything
suggests that we're already done
i don't know why it's still functioning
and i don't know if we can pay off that
debt
and i don't know if it will be paid off
or if we'll find some creative way to
make it go
away no we're in very uncharted
territory if you told me that we could
just
spend 30 trillion dollars
and have no plan to pay it back
i always said no way
people will see what's coming and the
country will
will be destroyed
just on the knowledge that we will be
destroyed in the future
but it doesn't seem to matter and i
don't know why maybe it all comes
crashing down at some point
but it doesn't look like it will
it looks like maybe there was some
illusion here that we pushed through
and maybe it created a giant problem
exactly the way it looks
but i would have expected to feel it
sooner
i'm not feeling it
the way everything in my common sense
such as it is
tells me
yeah somebody says with our military
that we're never going to be bankrupt
because our military puts us in a
privileged position
maybe
yeah there's definitely something to
that in terms of
you know that definitely gives us some
extra stretchiness
many are feeling it but not feeling it
at the level that i thought we'd feel it
i'm not saying we're not feeling it
yeah that's how the roman empire fell
somebody says
because the world is the reserve
currency you know i'm going to call
 on that too
so
it's been common
common thought that because we are the
reserve currency that's what keeps us
alive but
isn't the
the uh
the russian what what they have the
ruble
isn't that stronger than it was before
and they're not a reserve currency
yeah isn't the chinese juan doing okay
they're not a reserve currency so i'm
not even yeah britain's still around i'm
not even sure that any of that is real
i i don't know it's real anymore
i really don't because i i
i'm skeptical that the whole reserve
currency
matters the way
people assume it does because i would
have said the same thing about the debt
i always said that that we have 30 times
more debt than is the most we could ever
sustain
and i would be wrong by at least 30
times so far
the war machine is the reserve currency
yeah that's one way to look at it
that's one way
all right
now do the alcohol body pile yeah
alcohol is still bigger
that's why i say alcohol is poison
watch the saudis dump the dollar maybe
they will and maybe it doesn't make any
difference i just don't know
now really are you saying this i feel
like i should kick you off the
subscription service for saying
this all right i'm not gonna let this go
i know you're a subscriber and i always
say i'm gonna be nicer to the scriber so
here's this up comment put in
quotes like i'm saying it i don't know
what's real anymore about ukraine is
mopping up russia
do you think i said that today
that's the opposite of what i
said as clearly as possible
all right
so either correct that
and apologize
or get the off of this system
i i don't want you here to just make up
 about me and then put it in the
comments
right
you can disagree with me all you want
but don't make up
put it in quotes and put it in my
 mouth all right that is
absolutely
over the line
absolutely over the line
all right
yeah i mean i don't think i could have
said it any more clearly than that
oh is it the same guy just being a dick
all right well remind me who that was
and i'll i'll kick him off the system
later today okay
i didn't catch his name so one of you
tell me who it is and i'll get rid of
him
all right um
oh i would enjoy wine yes
the trouble with alcohol is not that
people don't enjoy it
i i personally don't do it
scott is back battling
i think you're saying that because you
know i'm making fun of that one right
when when anybody says somebody's
backpedaling
it hardly ever means that
well that's not true
in politics it does mean that
but usually if i'm just making a
different point somebody says he's
backpedaling
all right
people know they're getting alcohol well
people know they're getting fentanyl too
but the ones who know they're getting
fentanyl i suspect they do a better job
of staying alive
because they know how to deal with it
the actual fentanyl users
are well-versed in what kills them and
what doesn't
there's a satoshi nakamoto case in
norway
are they trying to prove that somebody
is or is not
satoshi nakamoto
is that happening
i don't know i don't know anything about
that story
um
[Music]
oh let's talk about
jordan peterson
you know i've been so curious how he
integrated his religious
philosophical thoughts with his hyper
hyper scientific
rationalism
and i i saw a video of him trying to
explain that
and
oh my god it was such a
linguistically beautiful
explanation
and i wanted to try to
you know summarize it but i think it was
the beauty with which he explained it
that made it work
um and the basic idea
was that it was sort of a
i hate to
i maybe i shouldn't do that because as
soon as you try to summarize somebody
who's smarter than you are it never
really works does it
and and the problem is he is objectively
he's smarter than i am
so if i try to summarize his smarter
than i am point i don't know if i'm
gonna do my service here
but
it did sound a little bit more like
religion gives you a model to live
and it's a good model it works
so
that uh that answer was compatible with
my own thinking and so
what people ask me hey why don't you ask
jordan peterson to be
interviewed
and i always say the same thing i think
we would just end up agreeing with each
other i don't know if that's the show
you need to see
because if you need more of jordan
peterson's opinion i don't know where
you could
i mean there's more of that content on
the internet than cat pictures
right um i don't have the link it's just
something i saw go by on
instagram one day
um
okay
yeah he essentially said it was a good
system yeah and that's what i say
and
you know
the other thing that jordan peterson
talks about a lot is finding meaning in
your life
let me ask you here
how many of you think you have found
meaning in your life
does your life feel like has it meaning
all right i'm saying yeses and no's
lots of yeses but an uncomfortable
number of no's
now i have a hypothesis that the ones
who feel they have meaning
have families children especially
at least a spouse
now is there any way to find meaning
other than
your family
is there any other way to do it
because i feel like
we're biological creatures
and our biological imperative is to
reproduce
so if you're if you're part of that
system in any direct or indirect way
now i felt i felt meaning as a
stepfather
so even though that's not direct
reproduction it's supportive of the
sort of reproductive process if you will
because people have to live after they
get born
and
i felt some meaning of that but it
couldn't possibly be anything like
an organic you know natural biological
parent it must be completely different i
assume
one assumes
so
and i think jordan peterson says you
need some religion
it would be nice and you need
somebody
oh here's the other thing he says
he talks about love
not being a case of finding your soul
mate
it's
he just he describes it as a decision
that two people make
and i've always said that
but he says it better so i guess he does
a better job of explaining do you buy
that
because i buy that completely
i think that
uh
love can only get you so far
but an agreement
when two people make an agreement to be
each other's protector
that that's a that's the highest level
of human behavior
and that
even calling it love is almost
diminishing it
maybe that's hyperbole but it's how i
feel
i feel that love is awesome and you
should have as much of it as you can get
it
but when two people make a conscious
decision
to be each other's protector forever
that's higher
that's the level above love
now maybe jordan peterson would call
that love and maybe you would too
uh and and of course you don't make that
agreement unless there's some feeling of
love typically
but to me that's higher that's a higher
calling
much higher
yeah
i think i think love
is a biological impulse
and i think deciding to be each other's
protector is an intellectual
um
act
and i think making an intellectual act
that includes sacrifice
right because it's built into that as
you're going to sacrifice for the other
person
i think that's just a higher level
calling
far far higher not even close
have i been catfished yet
yeah weirdly no
uh
of the love of existence and union
with being
okay
being as smart as you are chris asks
my 19185 iq reportedly
why didn't you at least try to have
smart kids
um you want another real answer
i don't know if i've ever said this
before
so there's more than one real real
answer because people don't do things
for just one reason usually it's usually
a constellation of reasons
i didn't want to have a kid who had my
medical problems
that's it
because if i did
i would hate myself forever
because i wish i had never been born
meaning that my childhood was so
unpleasant i was in physical
excruciating pain for the first 18 years
of my life
and i'd planned to
take my life in college
if i couldn't figure out how to solve it
now i did solve it first day of
college
and never came back
so
marijuana
marijuana salted you know the first time
i used marijuana
my pain went away and
anytime i worry about it coming back i
just make it go away
and i don't have any problem i have zero
problem
with something that put me in screaming
pain for 18 years of my life
so uh what was i talking about
oh why i don't want to have a kid
imagine having a kid
and bringing somebody into the world
with screaming pain for 18 years
i i couldn't live with that
could not live with that at all and then
of course there's also the
the uh
how nervous are you as a parent
right how anxious are you about you know
protecting your kids and i know myself
and i know that i was always super
afraid
that i would have a child
and that and that on my watch
the child would die
so that was my greatest fear that i
would be a parent and that i would do
such a bad job
that
that my child would die and i thought
okay i can't i can't handle that
now so i became a step-dad instead and
my child died
stepchild
but it was exactly my greatest fear
without the biological component but we
were very close
and
i got to tell you
that's permanent
you know i can't even imagine what it
would be like
had it been a biological child i can't
even imagine it but i saw what it did to
you know the biological parents and that
wasn't pretty
but even as a step-dad i'm
i'm scarred
right
everywhere i go i see him
everywhere
everywhere i go all the time i see him
it doesn't go away
and
please stop
so
um
fear
fear and maybe empathy
are the reasons i didn't have a kid
i was afraid of losing it
but then that happened anyway
and
um which actually taught me i could
probably have handled it so i guess i
made the wrong decision
and i also didn't trust
that the kid would be healthy and happy
and i'm going to tell you the next
reason that i've never said before in
public
unless you've heard me say this
i'm just going to be really honest
i've just never said this before
i wouldn't want a short kid if it were
male female's fine
i wouldn't want a short
male kid
now i've done okay five foot eight
right five foot eight i've done okay
but my life is completely
different because of my height
it's completely different
you are a second-class citizen in some
sense
i'm not going to comp compare it to
whatever your problem is
right i know you've got a problem too
everybody everybody's got something
but
the advantages of a tall male
are so substantial
i i wouldn't take the chance of creating
a small one
yeah i
i can't say that it bothers me on a
day-to-day basis right
but it's so obvious what the advantages
are
that it's hard to
it's hard to miss it
let me uh
let me put put out a little thought to
you
if you're a man who is six foot four
and let's say you're reasonably
fit
you know you can have sex with almost
any woman who's available right
did you know that
if you're six foot four and you're fit
basically every available woman will
sleep with you
that's just the truth
you got really quiet when i said that
did you i i've seen neither agreement or
disagreement but it is true
now i say these things as absolutes but
you know i don't mean absolute right i
just mean you know most of the time
and it
there's some yeses here all right let me
ask you this is there anybody here who
is that person that you don't have to be
six foot four exactly
but is there anybody here who is who is
of a you know pretty big height
and you know for sure that you can
basically have any woman you want
true
and i'm seeing i'm saying confirmations
like crazy yeah at a certain height you
can just have any woman you want
so
so there's my there's my answer
um
so
now now i'm not saying this being six
foot four and fit is the only thing you
need
you're still you still need a
personality you still need to be
assertive etc
but
it's not hard if you've got the height
it's pretty much automatic
yeah
and money helps yeah
to all women have advantages too
only in business tall women have
disadvantages in dating
because there are lots of lots of men
who would not date a tall woman same as
lots of women who are not dating short
man
all right
i believe i have nothing else to say
today and
can you give me a better topic to end
this on
anybody have a better topic
anything i should have talked about that
that i didn't
um
god were pathetic somebody says
reframed disgust
well that's sort of biological i don't
know if you could reframe that
um
oh the markets
yeah i don't know there's not much to
say about the markets
esg so i've got some more esg comics
coming
um
all right jim brewer bringing light to
the dark what
soccer legal
all right
looks like you're all over the place
today i think i did that to you
first day in college
all right i'm just reading your comments
for a moment here
women over five foot ten get weird
that's a pretty general statement
you know one of our robots coming so
last night i did a test of ecamm
the split screen software
and it worked there well so i think i'll
do some interviews
if i find somebody who wants to
uh
what
wife and daughter is stampeding in the
room oh
all right ladies and gentlemen
i'm going to say goodbye to youtube and
i'll talk to you tomorrow
