good morning everybody and welcome to
what will surely be
the highlight of your entire life if not
a highlight of civilization itself yeah
it's called coffee with scott adams and
i don't think anything has ever been
better
i know you like sunshine and
money and all those things but really
they pale in comparison to what we're
about to experience here and we can take
it up another notch all you need is a
copper mug or a glass a tanker jealous
steiner canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better
except
the vaccination it's called the
simultaneous sip of the happiness now go
oh i was wrong i'm sorry i was wrong it
made the vaccination better too oh
i'm not saying you should take it i'm
just saying it makes everything better
satan
he got a little bit better when we took
that step so it's really everything
well let's talk about the news
now because we live in a simulation and
the creator of this simulation clearly
has a sense of humor
we can look for this sense of humor in
many things that we think are
coincidence but really it's just a
simulation having a sense of humor for
example
on the trending news column today on
twitter
two stories that seem to be unrelated
or are they
were lumped together completely by
chance
the following titles appeared right next
to each other
number one
tubin
so there's some news about jeffrey
toobin and number two a story that says
sperm is being used to make dishware
now
i don't know that those two stories are
connected
but my first thought was i don't think
tuban can handle that kind of volume
that's my only question
i don't know if he can handle the volume
um
the most unusual thing that could ever
happen in the history of the universe
happened
recently
listen to this
you won't believe this this is one of
those things you would say to yourself
well that could you know
that could never happen
[Music]
and uh here's what it is ben shapiro
admitted he he was defeated in a debate
what
[Laughter]
have you ever uh
did you ever think that was going to
happen now it turns out it was kind of a
special case
so it wasn't it wasn't so much a
straight-up debate but here's what
happened apparently
uh so ben shapiro himself admits he just
got destroyed
uh in the debate but it wasn't so much a
point by point thing but rather
he was being interviewed by some someone
he didn't know
who he misinterpreted to be uh you know
showing the antagonism of of a political
leftist
so believing that he was being uh
sort of uh set up and attacked by
somebody who was just a lefty
he he reacted as though that's who he
was talking to and you know i think he
ended his he ended it before he was done
and blah blah blah so it seemed more
like it was a hit piece
and then i guess ben shapiro just
reacted as though he had been invited to
a sabotage
but it turns out it wasn't
it turns out it's just an interviewer
who asks hard questions
he wasn't leftist at all
and so ben
i give him total credit
for in defeat
he's a winner anyway
that's right
in defeat
meaning he admits he lost the
interaction
but by being
smart and
quickly
admitting that he lost and why
he wins
so believe it or not
he actually won by losing that's a real
thing this actually happened
so imagine being so good at debating
that you can lose and still win
that's how good ben shapiro is
all right this is part of my series that
i call humans are horrible
humans are horrible
that includes you
yeah you're human
uh includes me too
because we're gonna find entertainment
and tragedy
um not all of you
but some of you will find some
entertainment and tragedy and that means
that you're horrible people
well here's the story anti-vaccine uh
christian broadcaster somebody named it
marcus lamb
that's right there's a christian
broadcaster whose last name is lamb
marcus
lamb
is that a real name can somebody tell me
if he was born with the name lamb
you know because lamb
christ right
you all know your bible stuff
was that really his name
that's just a coincidence right
i don't know
my mom just confirmed name i don't
we're all lamps okay well anyway that's
his name but that's not the story
the story is that he was
an anti-vaccine crusader and he just
died of covet
now of course the news is dancing all
over this because you know it's another
way that they can promote vaccinations
so they're
the left is
being very very bad
very very bad
and seems to be enjoying the death of
this person because he's a political
opponent that they think did bad things
now here's the thing that is most
alarming to me he was exactly my age
and it looked like he's in good shape
at least the recent pictures he looked
it didn't have any obesity problem that
was
apparent in any pictures
64 years old
and he looked like a young 64. it looks
like he took care of himself
now apparently he did take ivermectin
and vitamin d and
i think hydroxychloroquine too maybe i'm
not sure about that last one
but he died anyway
now
as i tweeted and a lot of you know i'm
not a believer
personally
but i have a great respect for religion
because i think it helps people in a
whole variety of ways
so i'm very pro-religion i just
not personally a believer
but somebody has to tell me here because
i'm not a believer so i don't know how
these things work
does god ever express an opinion of this
directly
anybody
when you see something like this do you
say to yourself well that's a sign from
god
or do you say no you can't tell what god
is thinking you know he's mysterious
things happen for various reasons and
doesn't mean it's a sign from god
well let me ask you this
if this had gone the other way
would you think it was a sign from god
in other words
if the direction of this story was one
that you expected or believed or wanted
to be true would you would you have said
well that's a sign from god
that's a pretty clear sign from god
i'm saying those
very good
very good
now i'm not sure you know i'm not sure
you're all right about that
but the fact that you're all aware that
you would not treat it as meaningful no
matter which way it went
is a very encouraging sign we're going
to talk about critical thinking in a
moment but so far i'm impressed okay
so people are horrible but apparently
not the people watching this live stream
because many of you are
beautiful and smart and
unusually sexy i don't know if you've
noticed that
the people who watch this live stream
if you meet somebody else who watches
the live stream
just check them out
extra sexy i don't know why it doesn't
even matter what they look like
but there's just some kind of
animal magnetism that comes out of
people who watch this show and i can't
explain it
um
china's birth rate is uh looks like it's
in decline
they just registered the lowest birth
rate
since it's been recorded
wow
what is behind that
if you had to guess
and i'm sure smart people have weighed
in on this what is behind
china's low birth rate
what do you think because the government
doesn't want them to have a low birth
rate
economic growth
yeah whatever the economy improves birth
rate goes down
especially if you don't have immigration
so uh answer me a question somebody we
have so many smart people watching this
somebody will know this
would the birth rate in the united
states or let's say the population
decline would the population be
declining in the united states if we
didn't have immigration
anybody
would the would the population of the
united states be declining if we didn't
have immigration i see only yeses
oh do we know that
do we know that for sure
i see one no but almost all well a few
knows
some people not sure
um
yeah it might be close well almost
everybody's saying yes i think we got 95
yeses so
i don't know some of you do say no so
i'm going to say
it's not settled but it looks like
there's definitely some correlation
going on there
all right
here's what i think
i'm just going to put this out there
do chinese parents want to bring a child
into a police state
is that a thing
you know can we can we identify that
when the government uh is the most
repressive the birth rate goes down
is that a thing
i don't know if that's the thing i mean
one would assume
so buzz buzz is uh
is saying this might be mind reading
no speculation is fine
mind reading is when you're sure you see
something in there
if you say i wonder what people are
thinking and you speculate that it might
be this and for this reason that's
perfectly fair
but the moment i think i know i see it
well that's mind reading right and then
then you're in crazy town
but speculating is fine
well i i would think
based on everything i know about human
beings and economics
that uh people would make their decision
at least a little bit based on what
they're bringing into the world now you
are aware that there are a number of
people afraid of climate change in the
united states
who don't want to bring a child into the
world right are you aware of that how
many of you knew that that's becoming a
thing
people who don't want to have kids
because of climate change
well if climate change would cause birth
rates to change and i think this is more
anecdotal
you know the the part about um
climate change causing people to have
fewer babies i think that's only
anecdotal but we're seeing it i mean
it's a thing
i don't know if it's more of a thing
than the people having extra babies
but it's a thing
so why wouldn't uh if it's a thing for
some people and we know that because we
can talk to the actual people of that
opinion
why wouldn't it be true in china
i mean people are people when it comes
to stuff like that
yeah
but here's the other possibility you
ready for this
i'm going to blow your freaking mind
right now
there's one other possibility
it's us
the united states
because don't you believe that all the
major com countries have
persuasion campaigns going against their
competitors
if they don't they should
don't you think that china and russia
are trying to influence american
opinions
probably
what would be a way to destroy china in
the long run
to persuade them not to have babies
could somebody in the united states
let's say an intelligence organization
could they
or would they have the ability or the
power
to persuade chinese citizens to have
fewer babies as a long-run plan to
destroy china's growth
the answer is yes emphatically
now i have no evidence that anything
like that's happening
i just want you to know that if we
wanted to do that
and if the united states intelligence
agencies
brought the right people into the mix
they probably
could reduce the birth rate in any
country they wanted
do you believe me
how many think that's a reasonable thing
to say
that
a country could influence another
country to change their birth rate
i see some no's
i've seen lots of no's a mix of yeses
and no's
so you're pretty mixed on this one
i see some absolutely some yeses some
no's
all right
so it's unknowable i guess you know by
its nature since we haven't done it and
we haven't done a randomized control
test
i would agree it's unknowable
but
i would tell you from my personal
decades of experience as a trained
hypnotist
and an influencer
it would be in the easier category of
things to do
some things are really hard to persuade
this would not be
you you could you could move 10 of a
population if you tried pretty hard and
10 might be a lot right might make the
difference between growth and not growth
all right so i i have no reason to
believe that's happening but i'd be
surprised if it isn't because it's such
an obvious play
all right um
um i've heard that the birth rate
in china is getting so bad
that the government is actually
considering not murdering dissidents and
selling their organs
that's how bad it is
so keep an eye on that
um the supreme court is looking at an
abortion case that
i have to admit
i'm a little bit surprised
i didn't expect that even with the
changes in the supreme court
that
uh roe versus wade would be this
threatened and again i'm not giving you
any opinions on roe versus wade
i abstain from that because i don't have
babies and
never have uh so so to me women can work
that out the rest of you men can
certainly weigh in i have no objections
to men weighing in of course it's a
democracy it's only my personal decision
not to have an opinion on that
um
but mississippi's arguing
to keep their uh ban on abortions after
15 weeks which would effectively
you know come close to banning abortions
in the state
and the supreme court decided to look at
it
so
i didn't expect that
now
um i remember telling you that
you shouldn't not you but
people probably should not predict the
roe versus wade would fall
because any state that got rid of it
would no longer be competitive
in other words you couldn't attract top
talent to your state if something like
half of them said i'm not going there
because that abortion stuff
so i would so i predicted that it
wouldn't be
sweeping the country you know banning
abortion
because it would make your state
uncompetitive
but
mississippi was never competitive in the
first place
so i'm not sure that my prediction made
any sense you know if you're talking
about
you know one of the bigger states
um you know you can make that argument
but i'm not sure mississippi even cares
yeah it's not like they're tearing it up
to be the next tech
hub
so
um i will revise my opinion and i would
say it's looking slightly more like roe
versus wade will fall
or at least be constrained so much
in some states you know the obviously
the red states the blue states will stay
the same
but this is one of those things that's
really going to make that red state blue
state thing
which is already bad you know the the
division this is going to make it
pretty different
and i've also argued that the united
states would never
separate i mean you can't say never in a
thousand years but not but no time soon
do you have to worry about you know some
part of the united states separating
from some other part
but then i saw this abortion thing and i
thought what happens if all the red
stripes ban abortion
and all the blue states don't
that feels like that would be the first
time that there's like a really
significant
you know choose your country kind of
situation there
i'm still going to predict it's we're
not going to separate while i'm alive
you know during my lifetime
but this definitely makes it more likely
it looks like
um
and i'll be interested to see how the
court rules i don't even have a
prediction on that
remember i told you to follow the money
even when it doesn't make sense
you know you can predict the future by
looking at who's going to make money and
how
and i told you i added something to that
now everybody knows that right follow
the money it's the most basic thing that
every every adult knows oh somebody's
making money that's why everything's
happening
but i'm going further than that i'm
adding something to that which is that
even when there's no mechanism
this seems obvious
for why money should make the decision
different
it always does
even when there's no reason
i'm not sure it's causation or
coincidence but if you simply predict
that whatever the money suggests is
going to happen
you're going to be right most of the
time let me give you an example
moderna and pfizer have announced that
they're already looking at omicron
specific vaccines
so
do you think that there will be someday
a big push
i don't know if it'll be mandatory but a
big push
to get you a second kind of vaccine one
for the regular one and one for the
omicron
yes
yes
and it doesn't matter if the science
makes sense it doesn't matter if there's
nobody in it for the money well yeah
which would be hard to imagine
but even if
no one was in it for the money and you
could put a you know lie detector on
them and read their minds and there was
just nothing in there about money
it's still going to go the way the money
right now
let me extend that
take every
mystery and inconsistency you know about
coded
from the official data
is there one thing that would explain
all of it
is there one thing that would explain
everything that's happened that we've
observed
with the coronavirus
i see corruptions i see money
i see china
and i see vitamin d
which one of those explains everything
we see
all right from those choices
which one controls everything which one
would explain everything money
some say
money would explain everything
i i i'm gonna give money and vitamin d
both in a because they work together in
this case
so i think money is the right answer
but vitamin d has to be in the mix for
the money part to make sense
because when we look at what countries
are having good and bad results
i told you there was a study recently
that showed there was a perfect
correlate or very high correlation for
vitamin d
you know people with good vitamin d did
better than than the others
now
what explains africa
well they're younger they're less obese
there's that but i've got a feeling it's
going to turn out to be vitamin d
spending more time in the air i also
think ventilation is going to be one of
the biggest variables that we didn't
talk about enough
can somebody answer this question for me
in most of africa
so it's sort of a general statement
do they keep the windows open indoors
all the time
can anybody answer that question in
africa when you're indoors
are the are the windows open all the
time
um
yes because no oc one would assume
because it it never gets cold there
right
so don't they just leave the windows
open all the time
yeah if they have windows
i think even in the cities they leave
the windows open do they not
so
obviously they would have some air
conditioning in the cities but i think
even the cities would be a lot of
windows open
north africa gets very cold somebody
says
yeah i think vitamin d and ventilation
are going to be the
two of the biggest variables
that made a difference but you can't
make any money on opening windows
and you can't make any money
i mean if you're big pharma you can't
make any money on a generic vitamin
so i think money
is going to be
explaining everything
but not without also vitamin d
and not also without ventilation indoors
i think indoor ventilation is just going
to be the thing along with vitamin d
and then the reason that we're not all
completely informed that those things
are the big variables would be
what would keep us from being informed
that indoor ventilation and vitamin d
are really the biggest factors
money
the money
right that's what would keep you from
being informed now
i i've drawn a picture
that i cannot tell you is true
right i'm not going to tell you that
vitamin d will make you um invulnerable
from
i'm not going to tell you that
supplementing would make you
invulnerable
all right i do think that having good
vitamin d levels are positively
correlated with good health in every
possible way
or most possible ways including chronic
virus but that's different than you know
supplements will help you i think they
might good chance
but i think we're not quite there to
know that scientifically
however if you put money vitamin d and
indoor ventilation together
i think they explain every inconsistency
am i right
can anybody can anybody give me a
mystery about the coronavirus that's not
explained by one of those variables
thank you brian i appreciate
that um
just being thinner works do you think
that weight
is a variable that kind of explains it
all because actually that's a good point
because if
you're seeing that our governments are
not encouraging us to get healthy
i mean not really and they may have
mentioned it a few times but where is
your government telling you to
get fit
the most basic thing you say well nobody
makes money from that
right so almost every
inconsistency and mystery of why
anything's happening the way it is
seems to be explained by just a few
variables that
nobody makes money on
all right
doesn't mean it's true it just means
that it's a hypothesis that
fits all the observations
san francisco is uh
is uh hoping to
have a good holiday season and sell a
lot in the retail stores which is being
somewhat uh
hindered by the fact that the windows
are boarded up
because of all the smash and grab
robberies
if you go into
union square which is sort of the
high-end shopping part of san francisco
the windows have boarded up
can you imagine going to a festive
shopping excursion
into a place with boarded
windows oh my god the whole city is
ruined in my opinion
and uh police union leaders are blaming
the aclu
for essentially making it possible for
all the smash and grab robberies to be
unpunished
and
i ask you this question
this is an experience
that a lot of people in the cities are
going to have
they're going to go shopping
and they're going to find out that
it's so criminally
there's so much crime that they can't
even go shopping the way they used to
and
i asked this question
how bad would you have to be as a
republican candidate
to lose an election in 2022 or 2024
i feel like you would have to be the
worst politician in the world
to lose in this context
and and
you know i know that sounds like
hyperbole
but how in the world could you lose
i mean really
you would have to be
just
awful
to lose an election in this context
one way you could do it is just stick to
your far right opinions and just never
budge i mean that could lose you the
election sure
but if you had
any
like political savvy
you would go soft on your your your
right leaning stuff a little bit
and you could win any blue state you
wanted any any blue
election
i'm pretty sure if you know if i didn't
have my
baggage of my history
i'm pretty sure i could enter any blue
state election
as a republican
and win the election
except for you know
people would dig into my history and
find out about all my massive crimes and
whatnot
um
anyway
so if you see a republican losing an
election um
that is a really a bad bad candidate in
my opinion
it'd have to be a real exception
all right there's another school
shooting i'm not going to talk about any
of the details i'm not even going to
tell you where it was because i it's
just i don't want to encourage this
stuff
but i have an opinion that school
shootings are mostly caused by social
media
now right away your critical thinking
should say
and that would be correct
you should say something like that so
you should be saying something like wait
a minute there are lots of causes for
that
there's not one cause
nothing nothing has one cause you are
correct nothing has one cause
remember that because we're going to
talk about it again today
nothing is one cause
sometimes there's the last straw
but the last straw is not the heavy one
it's just the last one this is the last
thing that happened so the way our
limited brains are organized we think
the last thing that happened is the
cause
no it's probably just the last thing
that happened and it's you know random
like that
so like with coronavirus
is it the coronavirus that's killing you
if you have five comorbidities and
you're 100 years old
well
that's what the documents are going to
say
but no
all of that stuff had to happen for you
to die
coronavirus was just the last straw
so
you know keep that in mind when whenever
we talk about the cause of anything
it's never really the cause it's just
sort of the last thing that happened
that triggered it so there are triggers
no pun intended
um and in my opinion the trigger
and sort of the last thing will happen
before somebody at least a student could
start shooting
is a social media bullying
and here's my hypothesis
the hypothesis is that in the past
people were bullied in person and that
was pretty bad
being bullied in person is really bad
for you
but
it was a small group and it was private
have you ever seen the movie carrie by
stephen king
have you ever seen that
in the movie carrie there's a young girl
who
you know ends up killing a lot of people
but the the trigger for it was not all
of the bullying that happened you know
sort of on the baseline it was as she
got uh humiliated in public in front of
a big crowd
so it was the public part
that turned kerry from an angry bullied
person into a mass murderer
now that was a movie so don't take too
much for movies but
i think
that it's the the
public
the public part of it the social media
part of it
that has taken the high school bullying
to the carry level
and that
under this scenario
it should produce lots of carries
people who have been bullied to the
point where you know they're at their
breaking point
but then it becomes a social media thing
and then they break
because once it's public
you don't have anything to live for do
you
if you're a student
and you are publicly shamed so there's
no place you can go because they've
already heard of you
it's not going to feel like you have
anything to live for
all right now you do and nobody should
kill themselves over bullying in school
because if you get out of school
everything gets better so just sort of
last you know wait it out would be my
advice
but you could certainly predict it and
you could certainly understand it
and in my opinion social media should be
regulated like alcohol and firearms
because it has a similar risk
for young people
let's see in the comments how many of
you would agree
that social media has a risk
profile that's at least as dangerous as
alcohol and firearms and cigarettes
same class wouldn't you say
because one is you know the others are
more of a physical health problem
whereas the social media is a mental
health problem but it's a massive
problem
massive problem
so
uh mostly yes's now of course
you know most of us are over 21 so it's
easy for us to say we'll regulate other
people
we're all in favor of regulating other
people we just don't like to regulate
ourselves
somebody says not firearms yeah i think
you can make an argument for
a younger age for firearms
in some cases yes
all right um
chris cuomo was suspended
from cnn from the uh
new information about the extent to
which he was helping his brother the
governor who was accused of sexual
improprieties
and
when you see that chris cuomo is
suspended
uh of course you know that fox will be
uh enjoying this but there was a fox
headline
that i i just laughed
because i love this little uh rivalry
between cnn and fox
and
if you say you don't you don't enjoy
that i don't know you have to enjoy that
don't you i mean i enjoy it in both
directions watching the you know
watching the back and forth it's very
entertaining and i like that both of
them do it because it you know it's a
way to you know be a be a check on the
other i guess the excesses of the other
but here was fox's headline about it
about chris cuomo being suspended and
this is so diabolically humorous
without without trying without going
over the top
just listen to how funny this is coming
from fox news
uh quote
cnn punishes its only star
come on you have to appreciate the
headline
from from fox news you know being being
like a way to prod the competitor cnn
punishes its only star
what makes what makes chris cuomo their
only star
now i understand he has the highest
ratings but that might have to do with
the time slot right
he's clearly not their only star
but the fact that the
fox
fox frames this as cnn only has one star
and he just
you have to be fired for bad behavior
oh that's funny
anyway
i continue to support most of what chris
cuomo did for his brother for the same
reason that cnn kept him on until now
which is that
people helping their brother
you know you just
you just got to be understanding of that
right you know that's just a special
case but he may have gone too far that's
what the new information suggests so
that's what they're looking at and i
think it's responsible for them to
suspend him at this point
it's just good for the brand i think
but here's what we've learned um about
the jeffrey toobin situation and
and now the chris cuomo thing if you put
it all together we've learned that
cnn will keep you employed
you can be a dick
like don lemon you can yank your dick
like tuban
but you can't help your brother if your
brother's a dick
so that we now know the standard
you can't be a dick but you can yank a
dick and you can't help your brother if
he's a dick
so that's sort of the dick rule at cnn
and they're very consistent about that
i'll give them the credit
uh there's a reuters fact check
in which
which apparently it's a video of jill
biden or reading to children
and some wag
added a
layered on some extra video of a child
who quote appears to shout a profanity
towards the us first lady
now have any of you heard the video i
haven't heard it because you know the
fact checkers don't don't show the
video but
every time somebody i assume this is you
know somebody on the political right did
this but every time somebody in the
right doctors a video
it just makes me so happy
because
because every time the left sees that a
video has been doctored
it should give them a little bit of just
a slight little grain of salt
hesitation
about the videos that they believe
all right because they're up to how many
hoaxes have the left believe because
they think they saw it on video
fine people hoax
uh the covington kids the koi fish
feeding
the drinking bleach they're all fake
videos
meaning that they were edited to reverse
their meaning or whatnot
so somebody needs to send me a link to
the doctored video
because i've got a feeling it's pretty
good
anyway
so democrats normally didn't get to see
all the rupar videos but now they're
seeing
they're seeing doctor videos and it
might make them think that
well on the bad news front uh war has uh
begun in space
uh which i was not aware of it turns out
that according to u.s uh officials
military officials
uh
russia and china are attacking our space
assets quote every single day
now i think their attacks are
non-kinetic meaning it's hacking and
digital and you know jamming and stuff
like that
but
did you know that war in space is
already on
and that you know china's launched their
hypersonic
missile and you know we're gearing up
let me give you some bad news
what are most wars about
go
what are most wars about
anybody
land and resources
mostly land right
even even more than resources at least
in the modern world in the old days it
was land and resources
in the modern days it's mostly land and
you know yes resources you know kuwait
for example
um
territory right you know what the
problem is with space
yeah you do
it's all new territory
the odds of having a uh
a superpower
war in space what are the odds of a
superpower war in space
it's a hundred percent
it's a hundred percent
because while we might not want to start
a war terrestrially
because that means that everybody dies
you know if it becomes nuclear on earth
everybody dies
but there's a hundred percent chance
we're going to be fighting like crazy in
space
because it's
it's here's another one it's not just
territory it's the high ground
the the reason that anybody would
conquer any um territory that they don't
already own
in today's world
sometimes resources but usually defense
they're they're taking over a
neighboring country to bolster their
defense
in other words the high ground exactly
golan heights
what's the important of the golan
heights
it's the high ground
right
and space is the ultimate high ground
because it's hard to shoot things up but
it's easier to shoot things down
and i imagine it'd be a variety of
advantages to owning space especially
the satellites right whoever whoever can
protect their satellites
gets to have a good life on earth
whoever can't protect their satellites
they lose
so
uh yeah there's gonna be war in space
and it looks like it's already started
it's just not kinetic yet but you know
that everybody's working on a kinetic
weapons for space
right i mean how hard would it be to
take out a satellite
it seems like you need a
a bullet sized projectile that had some
navigation ability and that's it
that's all you need
something the size of like a large
bullet with some navigation ability
goodbye satellite
it just has to be uh launched from space
so you just put it up on your
on your rocket
and release it with some uh instructions
and boom goodbye satellites
yeah that would be possible now yeah we
have all the technology to do what i
just described
uh i asked this poll uh this is the
worst poll i've ever done because you
know it's the wrong choices and it's
non-scientific and everything else so
don't take too much from this but i
asked who is most responsible for the
january 6 protests at the capitol
my choices were trump fake news
the cia
via q
all right that's just sort of a cheeky
one
and congress
now some people said i should put the
protesters themselves
uh or maybe nancy pelosi and muriel
bowser for denying the capitol police
the backup and those are good things to
say now if i put the protesters
themselves as one of the choices
it wouldn't be any fun
because that would have won right i
think i think if you put the protesters
themselves
i kind of think they would have had 80
of the vote
that wouldn't tell you anything so i
wanted to see besides the obvious fact
that the people who went there are
obviously
in charge of their own life
you know who beyond that
so trump got the last i looked about 11
of the votes
fake news got well 47
as the cause of january 6.
the cia via
q or q anon
24
and congress about 18
now here's my take on it so i think uh
the public got this right for the
biggest
result was fake news i believe
that when you say hey the protesters are
themselves responsible
if you talk about legal responsibility
100 correct
the the res the people who go there and
do the act are legally
100 responsible
just as i would apply that same standard
to uh alec baldwin
even though he has a perfectly good
reason why he did what he did the
armorer was in charge blah blah he's the
one who did it
right he could have checked
to make sure he didn't have a live round
he could have not picked pulled the
trigger when it was just rehearsal you
know there are a lot of things he could
have done so it's the same standard for
legal reasons
uh or in the case of gun gun control
more of a gun rights or a gun safety
reason
but here's my view of the real world
people don't have free will you're all
programmed by
outside sources
including me
right if you believe that humans are
largely just programmed entities and the
programming is assigned to them from
external sources some of it from their
friends some of it from the media some
of it from the fake news
um
some of it from social media that's how
i see the world
now i'm not asking you to see it the
same way i'm i'm not describing a
framework
or a frame to see the world and you
could say that it's either predictable
it either predicts or it doesn't
so the way to say your worldview is good
or not
is uh predict or doesn't predict and i
would say if you say to yourself
the fake news has programmed people to
the point where
they distrust
the government
and the democrats plus the news entity
which all seems the same at this point
that's that's a pretty accurate world
view to think that the the fake news
programmed people to make the choices
they made
now from a legal perspective it always
has to still be the person who did it
not the person who influenced them
but if you want to understand the world
as opposed to assigning blame which we
have to do for practical purposes if you
want to understand the world
uh
okay that totally worked
erica
all right uh i'm gonna now look at the
video of jill biden
being shouted at or am i damn it
bug
just crapped out
all right
well thank you
um
all right so i i blame fake news for
programming the public and not just the
left but the right if the news had ever
been
real would there have been
a protest
let me ask you this
suppose the news had always reported
this
the courts have found no fraud
but you have to understand the courts
are not the right entity to look for
fraud or to find it they can only judge
the things that they have
that people have standing for and nobody
understanding
and they can and they only accept cases
that would make a difference and if it's
after the election sometimes they say it
doesn't make a difference
so if the news had accurately reported
that the
election system can't be audited fully
it's not an option we don't have a
system that can do that
you can only audit some things so you'll
never really know
if the news had told you that
if it told you that probably the biggest
difference was that the
democrats did a good job of manipulating
the election laws because of the
pandemic it was all legal but they did a
good job of it
if the news had told you straight what
happened with the election
even if
they still criticized trump for going
too far about claiming fraud
even if they completely criticized him
do you think there would have been a
protest
i feel like not
because i feel like the protest is in
large part and again lots of different
variables and they all had to happen the
way they did for it to happen but i
think one of the big variables is that
the news isn't real and that without
that
that safety check
people feel exposed
if you tell me that the news is is uh
looking into all the corruption in the
government i say to myself okay okay let
them handle it
the news business is going to go find
that corruption they're going to uncover
it and then justice will be had i don't
need to get involved
but what if you think the news the news
is colluding with the corruption
which it is
it legitimately is i mean we know that
for sure because of the
russia collusion thing
so if you believe that the news has gone
corrupt and has joined
the corrupt government and their
corrupt plans
i think you go to the streets you know
not everybody but it would be a
predictable outcome of fake news
so given that there's no such thing as a
cause for anything calling trump the
cause is absurd causing any calling
anything else from q to anything else as
the cause is absurd
let me ask you this if congress had a
rating over
what 11 or 13 approval do you think the
people would have marched on the capitol
suppose the congress had a
50 approval
do you think that people would have
marched on the capital where the
congress was i don't think so i don't
think so i think people would have said
you know we're really mad oh we're not
really mad at those guys
we're really mad at what happened
you know maybe the election but not
necessarily so mad at congress
if that had been the case they wouldn't
have been there at all
so all of this what is the cause of the
protest is just brainwashing
there's no cause there's a whole bunch
of things that had to happen including
pelosi and bowser denying capital police
including the protesters own personal
decisions
but if you're ignoring what is probably
the biggest variable
don't do that
probably the news is the biggest
variable because we feel exposed and
unprotected by not having a legitimate
news industry anymore
um
all right
let's see what else is happening oh
here's some fun
so there was a tweet by somebody named
mike salana who has enough followers
that i think he must be
well known for something maybe maybe
investing he has a his profile is
says he's the mayor of san francisco
which he isn't so i don't know what else
to believe on there
but he's somebody of substance
apparently and i say that only because
elon musk replied to him
so mike solano solana
tweeted this seems like we should all be
a lot more concerned about the fact that
hypnosis is a real thing question mark
mind control real
basically
why does this not matter
is that a good question
if hypnosis is real
it is and then mind control is real
shouldn't we be worried about this
why aren't we
well i answered that the best hypnotists
are invisible
because they operate outside the realm
of imagination
if you knew what hypnotists were capable
of doing
you could see it
if you don't know what they're capable
of doing it looks like a coincidence
and i gave this example
if i went on
live tv
and changed the world right in front of
you
you would think it was a coincidence
you would because your imagination could
not hold
the possibility that i just changed the
world right in front of you
it's just not imaginable
so the best hypnotists are completely
invisible
they operate without any attention
i could tell you in i could tell you
directly what i'm doing and you just
can't see it
unless you're another hypnotist other
hypnotists can see it pretty easily
so
elon musk replied this way about the
mind control etc he said the overarching
problem is that we need better mental
firewalls for the information constantly
coming at us
critical and first principle thinking
should be required course in middle
school
who wrote the software in your head he
says are you sure you actually want it
there
so this is elon musk asking
who wrote the software running in your
head are you sure you actually want it
there
it's the same thing i just told you
about the january 6 protests
the people who went there had some
software running in their head
who wrote
it
wasn't them
you don't write your own software
other people write your software
always elon musk knows it
i know it
and uh you're learning
uh some of you were learning some of you
knew it but
um what do you think should we teach
critical thinking and first principles
in middle school
um i say yes
good suggestion
but
it is woefully uh lacking
it's good
but it doesn't come close to what we
need here's what we need
uh here was my response to elon musk's
comment i said 75 percent of the best
critical thinkers in america
fell for five to ten obvious major media
hoaxes in the last five years
and still don't know it
we also need to teach detection
that's that's different
 detection is completely
different than critical thinking
critical thinking would help you let's
say
look at a study claim and see if they
you know were a randomized controlled
trial you know you could look at sort of
scientific-y things
and maybe even legal things and say okay
that's logical or not if you're an
engineer
you need those critical skills thinking
skills
but if you're looking at the news do you
think your critical
skills are helping you
let me tell you what the amazing randy
has claimed
now the amazing randy is a debunker of
fake frauds but also a famous magician
himself and the amazing randy says that
the easiest people to fool are
do you know the answer to this
the amazing randy a professional
magician
of note your famous one
says the easiest people to fool are
scientists
and smart people yeah smart people
do you know why they're this easiest to
fool
because they if they don't think they
know any other answer for what they're
observing
they say it must be one of the things
they can imagine
so the scientists will look at a
situation say well
you know it could be this or it could be
this but those are the only things i can
imagine
so it's one of those
you can fool them every time
because here's the first thing i'd teach
somebody that probably is not in your
critical thinking course it should be
but i'll bet it wouldn't be
that your imagination is your limiter
your imagination
if you can't imagine something you can't
see it
your imagination doesn't go there you
first your imagination has to accept it
if you can't do that you're never going
to think of it
so the scientist is easy to fool with
the magic trick or with a fake psychic
because they think well i've looked at
all the possibilities and there's
nothing left but this is a real psychic
whereas james randy comes in and says
now there's a couple other things you
haven't considered
and that's why i can debunk them and you
can't
scientists are not the ones who always
debunk um you know the frauds
sometimes it's magicians
because they know the tricks
all right
so we need a detection and my
my book loser think uh tries to do that
i think that should be required reading
in schools
i asked this following speaking of
critical thinking i will i'll give you a
lesson in critical thinking right now i
asked this question on twitter how
confident are you
that you're getting vaxxed or not
getting vac's decision was the correct
one for you
now keywords are for you
right forget about the rest of us
was your vaccination decision the right
one for you
so the people who said they're 100
percent
confident was a 41 percent last time i
checked
41 percent were 100 confident in their
own decision
uh 25 percent had high confidence
22 percent medium confidence confidence
and 11 said low
my own would be
medium
medium to high
that's how i would have answered it
here's your critical thinking lesson for
today
most of the people who said they're 100
confident do not have critical thinking
skills
some of them uh probably already had the
were probably already
infected so if they said i was already
infected therefore i didn't get the
vaccination well you could be pretty
pretty close to 100 sure on that
but i don't think most of these 40 were
necessarily already
infected
uh you could also say well there's some
people with you know 10 comorbidities
and they're pretty close to 100 sure
but for most of these people who are 100
sure
if you're 100 sure about this
then unless you're one of those special
cases
then you don't have basic
critical thinking skills because this is
not the kind of decision
that you should be 100 sure of
this is a risk management decision
the moment you think is binary
you know where it's one with one or the
other and it's 100
you you uh you have missed a lot of
critical thinking training in your life
now is that because you're dumb
are the people who have 100 confidence
and they're not one of those special
cases are they dumb
no
nope
they are not
they are people who have just not been
exposed to a specific skill you don't
you don't learn critical thinking just
by waking up in the morning and being
all smart
right can anybody confirm that i don't
want to be the only one saying this
those of you who have gone through some
kind of critical thinking training
whether it's economics or
or whatever it was
can you confirm for me that this is a
learned skill it's not something natural
i mean natural helps
natural definitely helps you'd be
naturally smart but you need to learn
technique
and people imagine that they don't need
it if they're just sort of good you have
good common sense
and so i would say to you that if you
answered 100
i'm not going to criticize you for that
so i'm not going to criticize anybody
who said 100 even though i believe
it's a pretty strong signal that they
haven't studied critical thinking
because here's the thing
we all of us have some gaps in things
we've studied
right i got lots of gaps
tons of them
so if you say scott you don't know about
i don't know physics
because you didn't study it i'm not
going to say oh you've insulted me for
my lack of physics understanding
i'm going to say well that's true i have
not studied physics
so i'm saying to you if you haven't
studied critical thinking
you might not know what you're missing
all right um
rasmussen asked this poll still in the
context of critical thinking here how
much do you trust big pharma i'm
paraphrasing their question
six percent said they trust big pharma
quote a lot
what
36
says somewhat
uh 57 said uh they don't trust big
pharma very much or they're unsure i
think unsure means you don't trust them
right
if somebody says do you trust somebody
and you say you're unsure
what the hell does that mean
you if you don't trust them
you don't trust them you're unsure you
don't trust them so i just lump those
with don't trust
um
so what do you think of that do you
think people have good critical thinking
um
six percent
don't because they trust big firm a lot
i think that's a you know in a rational
opinion given what we know
um
and uh then rasmus rasmussen said
do you think that big pharma is more
interested in profits or making
customers lives better
25 percent answered that big pharma's
main interest is not profits
but rather making a customer's lives
better
huh
25
think pharma
is more interested in our well-being
than their billions and billions and
billions and billions of dollars of
profit
25
if you're new to the live stream
you might not know that it's an ongoing
joke that 25
of the public will get every poll
question wrong
i don't know if it's the same 25
but yes trillions actually it's
literally trillions of dollars for the
the pharma companies that's correct
and then uh this question do pharma
companies have too much influence on the
government
seventy percent said yes
huh
seventy percent said yes big pharma has
too much influence on the government
which leaves
25ish percent probably unsure if you
take out the the uncertains
once you see it you can't unsee it the
25 thing i mean it's not exactly 25
every time but it's so consistent it's
hilarious
all right
that
is my incredible show for the day i
think it's the best thing you've ever
seen in your life
i'm going to have to go do some other
things today's the day that my cat gets
her feeding tube taken out and her life
goes back to normal and i can't tell you
how happy i am about that
it's the best thing ever
and boo is doing great she's climbing
and jumping and
purring she's very hungry this morning
because i have to keep her unfed for a
while because she has to go under to get
her tube out
but uh she's doing great and i'm doing
uh i'm doing okay myself
so uh
i hope made your life a little bit
better today
and
go off and have a great rest of your day
and i'm gonna see you
tomorrow
