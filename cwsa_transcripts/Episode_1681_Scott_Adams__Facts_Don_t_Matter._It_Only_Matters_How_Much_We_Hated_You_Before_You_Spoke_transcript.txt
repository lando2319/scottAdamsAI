i'm gonna have to do it thanks paul by
the way
um all you need is a copyrighted glasses
thank you chelsea and canteen
dragonflies vessel vacant fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day sorry i was
distracted by a meme on locals it's uh
called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
oh yeah
that's good stuff
you know every now and then i use my
ipad
that i use for
youtube
i use it to watch a show
and i have to unplug the
you know the connection to do it and i
tell myself when i do it you know what
i'll tell you one thing i'm not going to
forget
i'm not going to forget to plug in this
cable
because i'm going to see
a cable sitting right in front of me
that's not attached to anything and how
can you look at a cable right in front
of you that's not attached to anything
and say
i'd better not do anything
well that happened to me today all right
big news uh federal government's
starting some kind of wildfire wildfire
mitigation commission
and they're looking for experts to tell
them what to do because they don't know
how to
mitigate wildfires this doesn't seem
like a big thing to you
but if you live in california
it's a pretty big thing
we actually have
what i call the smoke season
you know we we used to have
two seasons in california there used to
be the
the rain season and then the not rain
season and that was basically it
you know one was a little colder a
little rainy but otherwise everything
was about the same
but now in the summer for like a two or
three month period is you can't go
outside it's just
so smoky
from all the wildfires so it's a big
deal
i hope they get this right
i always had the idea of sending all the
homeless people to live in the forest
you know give them actual shelter and
bathrooms and you know some things they
need but let the homeless people clean
up the forest
you know to remove the brush
i just go out there every day remove
some brush
except you know i thought of this i
thought this would be a brilliant idea
they need a place to stay
ideally not in a you know apartment
building where other people would be
concerned about their drug use or
whatever let them let them live in the
forest and do foresty things and
and just do something useful
uh it actually sounds like an idyllic
life doesn't it live in the forest do
drugs and and just clean up some brush
once in a while
well here's a surprising story and i've
been waiting to hear about this
so we've got all this violence in
ukraine
you know russia's invasion
and
were you wondering the same thing i was
wondering which is
what does
pope francis think about the violence
because just the other day i was
thinking to myself i wonder if
i wonder if the pope
is in favor of violence
in this case
you know he's fairly consistent against
violence
but i was wondering i wonder if he'd
make an exception and be in favor of
violence for once
but now it turns out he made a statement
and uh the pope is opposed to violence
in ukraine so you can stop wondering
the pope has made a firm statement
um and i guess he's remaining consistent
so he's once again he's against violence
25 years ago i did a joke
about
permanent news
probably 30 years ago about permanent
news and the joke was that the permanent
news was that the
the pope has announced he's opposed to
the violence
just every time
every time hey the pope he's still
opposed to violence well i think it's
good that he reminds us that
speaking of fake news
uh
there was a lot of concern yesterday
that iran had allegedly
sent some cruise missiles into
some american consulate or some kind of
american facility in herbal in iraq
and that maybe it was uh
payback for something
that somebody got killed or something
and today the
state department
issued a statement and said there's no
damage or casualties at any u.s
government facility
in arable
so
so i guess it didn't happen
so all those reports yesterday about
some kind of uh american diplomatic
consulate or something
being blown to crap by iran
never really happened according to the
state department never happened
oh wait a minute let me see the
specificity of this statement
let me read again no damage or
casualties at any u.s government
facility u.s government facility
what would u.s government facility mean
in iraq
would that mean that the u.s government
owned the real estate
what if we rent
yeah what if it's in iraq and we release
it what if we're leasing land
would that be a case of u.s government
facility
or would that be an iraqi facility that
is temporarily
housing some americans doing things
well i don't know
but as mike sudovich pointed out
to this statement
at this point you just have to shake
your head and laugh
because you can't believe anything
anything
i don't know did something get blown up
maybe
was it something we owned i don't know
this is something we leased maybe
did any americans actually get
hurt
who knows
would we know
maybe maybe we wouldn't
so another another situation of who
knows what happened
well have you noticed this
that we have completely stopped caring
about
topics
and we only care about
people
for example
glenn greenwald is trending
not because of his opinion
it's because
he has the opinion
that's the news
the news is not what his opinion is
the news is was he is he defending
russia
no
let's not worry about him and his
personality or what he has or has not
done in the past
is his opinion valid
because if you're calling him an
apologist
or anybody else
you're probably experiencing cognitive
dissonance
and i think apologist is the new tell
for cognitive dissonance
because when you're calling somebody an
apologist
it allows you to completely ignore your
argument or your point
you just dismiss the person as well
why would we even listen to those
arguments
that person is an apologist an apologist
an apologist for putin so it's my view
that anybody who uses the word apologist
as a description for someone else is
experiencing cognitive dissonance and
that you should ignore them completely
um
here are some other examples of the
personality being more important than
the fact
so we're arguing over glenn greenwald
not because of his opinion opinion but
because of him
same thing with jimmy dore
i'm seeing a bunch of criticism about
jimmy dore
on the internet
you can read a lot of criticism about
jimmy dore but you know what you won't
see
the reason
the reason
what part of his opinion did he get
wrong
no he's just an apologist
that's what that's what the critics are
saying oh no he's just pro-putin he's
just an apologist to which i say
can you give me an example
would i have the same opinion if you
told me what he said
would i say that's apologetic
apologia or whatever you want to say or
is that just a fact
if jimmy dore said and i don't know if
he did but suppose he said
that there are some neo-nazis on the
ukraine side
would that be
an apologist for putin
or would that just be an accurate fact
one of many certainly not the not the
fact that makes the decision but one of
many
here's some more
when we talk about tucker carlson joe
rogan or bill gates are we ever talking
about their opinions
not exactly right we're talking about
them your opinion about bill gates's
opinions
is only about
bill gates it's not even about what he
says
i mean you we imagine it's about what he
says but it's not it's it's entirely
about bill gates how you feel about him
by the way joe rogan had some
very funny insights about bill gates
being a person to tell us how to
handle our health
when bill gates is maybe not the picture
of health
now joe rogan said it in a more
humorous and cutting way
so you should see his version it's
funnier but
uh
that's not a bad point you gotta wonder
why somebody who's lecturing you about
health is in bad health
gotta wonder
um so am i am i wrong that we've we've
completely left the field of arguing
about the facts we don't even do it
anymore
i mean i i think even the you know the
trucker thing in canada
turned out to be about truckers and
about trudeau
i'm not even sure anybody cared about
the details after some point
now i'm exaggerating a little bit but we
have to watch out for the fact that only
the personality is what we're talking
about
because it feels like it speaking of
personalities
i don't understand this
but apparently there was some wall
street journal
well at least wall street journal did a
poll
and said that if trump and biden ran
today it would be a tie 45 percent to 45
do you believe that
because
it seems to me that we also have reports
that a generic republican would just
destroy a just a generic democrat
is trump the exception
is trump the only republican who can't
destroy every democrat in the next race
because he might be
he might be the only exception because
he's the one person that people
put so much
let's say weight on his personality
that they kind of can ignore his
his policies
so he might be the only person who can't
beat biden which would be weird
um
i i have a hard time believing biden's
really gonna run but maybe you never
know so here's some uh things that are
shifting lately we talked about trevor
noah
saying that if trump had been president
saudi arabia would have taken his call
which most of us probably agree with
that don't you so saudi arabia just
didn't take the call with biden because
they're mad at him for whatever
and
but even trevor noah says you know they
would have taken trump's call
add to that um
bill maher he's got two opinions which
seemed weird together
so these are both opinions he expressed
on friday
he asked and this is reasonable he said
why didn't putin invade ukraine
when trump was president
because wasn't trump supposed to be all
putin loving
enabler
so so bill maher quite reasonably says
if if trump was such an enabler
why did the invasion happen under biden
and not trump
that's a good question right
now
i give credit
to bill maher for asking this question
now he's you and trevor trevor noah as
well
just the fact that they can even float
the question
i think it shows some kind of
some kind of movement in a good
direction
but at the same time
bill maher mocked trump for saying that
the problem in ukraine was all caused by
a rigged election
and he sort of mocked it because trump
always goes back to his talking point
about the election
except
if you've already accepted that there
might be a reason that putin didn't
invade under trump
trump's answer
that the election is the problem in
ukraine is exactly right
under that assumption
if you believe that the election was
rigged right so i'm not making that
assumption i'm saying that's trump's
assumption
so his answer is spot on and it agrees
it agrees at least with bill maher's
question if not his opinion and the
question is
why didn't putin invade when trump was
president
and trump agrees if he'd been president
it wouldn't have happened
so you're seeing bill maher and trump
actually completely agreeing
but they can't quite get there so they
have to act like they're disagreeing
i think bill maher has to act like he's
disagreeing with trump even when he's
not exactly disagreeing
so he played both sides here a little
bit
um
how about beto o'rourke said in public i
guess this week that
critical race theory should not be
taught in schools
did you ever think you'd see that
so i think the democrats maybe
just maybe
are starting to see
that the poles are not going their way
so the
do you think those three things are
forming a pattern or no
so here are the three things
um
the three things would be uh trevor noah
saying trump would have done better on
at least the phone call bill maher
saying
you know why didn't putin invade under
trump
and alberto o'rourke saying critical
race theory should not be taught in
schools
now he might be word thinking there a
little bit and maybe he's saying
that the
the high level college level critical
race theory should not be taught but
i don't know that he's against
the ideas of it
so this might be a little bit fake news
what do you think
does this look like fake news because it
might be that the only thing he's
disagreeing with
is that a high level
college philosophy course
should not be taught in grade school
but maybe the concepts which are simpler
you know don't discriminate blah blah
maybe that should so i'm not sure that
this is a real story
but
somebody says yes fake
yeah i think it's a framing story a
little bit
but i do wonder
if there's going to be any movement
toward uh
trump was right
all right
here's something quite interesting on
cnn an opinion piece by richard gallant
and he points out that the
russian bombing of the civilians in
ukraine might not work out because we
have some historical precedent you
always have to be
careful about looking to history for
your patterns
because nothing really is the same as it
was then
but
it is useful context so in 2011 three
american researchers this is what
richard gallant writes
in cnn
three american researchers revealed an
eye-opening finding
about the u.s bombing campaign in
vietnam war
and they found that the more bombs that
were dropped in south uh on south
vietnamese hamlets
in 1969 the likelier the vietcong
insurgents were to end up controlling
the territory afterwards
so it's almost as if the more you bomb
the civilians the more likely they're
gonna
you know resist you stronger and it's
not gonna work the way you want
um then two years later this other
historian richard ovary
what a last name ovary
he did a study he concluded that the
targeted bombing of european cities in
world war ii was also a
military failure
so there are two examples in which
bombing civilians
in modern i guess that would be modern
times if you count world war ii
um
worked the opposite of it the way it was
supposed to
now i'm not sure that we should believe
either those studies
would you believe a study like this
because when i saw this first one about
vietnam
i said you know they bombed these
hamlets and they were more likely to
become
viet cong strongholds isn't that the
reason they were bombing them
don't they have cause and effect
backwards
why would you bomb something that was
irrelevant
are you only going to bomb something
that you think the enemy
has a stronghold in
i'm not sure i believe any of this
but it's worth asking if there's any
i asked the same question i said
is there military evidence
to suggest that bombing civilians works
we know it depopulates
but if you looked at the long run
is the history that it works
i don't know
it works to depopulate
and if that's all you're trying to do to
get an advantage i suppose it works in
that limited sense
i don't know i don't think it works
you bomb what you can't reach with
troops that seems like the only thing
that makes sense i don't think you bomb
to break will
so i i don't trust anything that's
coming out of ukraine how many of you
saw the viral photo
of what was alleged but probably not
a russian soldier chained to a
chain to a pole and froze to death
because they didn't want him to desert
so they chained him to a pole and he
froze to death
it looks like that's pure ukrainian
propaganda and it might even be a dead
ukrainian soldier it doesn't even look
like it's a russian soldier
yeah and
if the soldier had a weapon
like a gun
didn't the soldier have a weapon
you're telling me that the soldier
wouldn't try to just shoot the chain
right did they leave him there without a
gun
i don't know
but i wouldn't believe anything coming
out of ukraine
well
there's uh
now the number of uh coven cases in
china is up to 3 400 new cases
the highest since february 2020 and
local transmission in provinces
is starting to ramp up
so what would be the outcome of a major
outbreak of covet at this point in china
it would be a supply chain problem
wouldn't it
this would be our fourth if it happens
our fourth
global supply chain challenge
in uh like
two years
to which i say
that doesn't feel like a coincidence
anymore does it
it just feels like we're a simulation
and somebody is testing
supply chain
pressures
it looks like we're testing the supply
chain like that we're just a simulation
we're running a
we're running a bunch of simulations say
okay would this break the supply chain
no okay how about this
would this break the supply chain
so far so far we're doing okay
all right um
rasmussen reported that
election integrity is now the number
three issue with voters
so the top three issues per person
are
inflation
violent crime
and election
integrity let me see who would you
expect to get elected if the top three
issues were
inflation violent crime and
election integrity
how would a democrat ever be elected
unless they ran against trump and people
just didn't like trump for some reason
amazing
it just doesn't seem to me like anybody
would ever vote for a democrat
if these are the top three issues with
voters
these top three issues are so
overwhelmingly positive for republicans
i just
you know if the democrats sweep i'm
gonna have a real question about
election integrity
are you
all right
i saw another article by francis
fukuyama
in a publication called american purpose
who is actually openly asking about
should we be thinking about
russia literally losing on the
battlefield
and i still think that's going to be a
thing
i think i did have the number of russian
tanks completely wrong
i told you in december i saw a report
that there were twelve hundred russian
tanks
but then i saw andres backhouse correct
that to maybe twelve thousand
twelve thousand something
so to be twelve thousand something tanks
17 000 something anti-tank missiles in
country and i think that number probably
is low
you thought they were out of fuel i
still think they're running out of fuel
so yelling yelling my own opinion at me
that i still hold in all caps did not
get you as much as you hoped
oh 12 000 including reserves
twelve thousand for the whole nation of
russia
um
that was russia's gas supply yeah
so here's what i think
i think that
the ground forces of russia
are being degraded to the point where
they won't be an effective ground force
in the north
and if putin loses in the north
it's not going to matter as much if he
wins in the south because it's going to
look really bad
now we're also already seeing in the
news
experts saying you know who
who you really have to worry about
is or who putin has to worry about is
his own intelligence people turning on
him
don't you think we're doing that
intentionally to get putin worried about
his own inner because apparently he's
reportedly he's arrested his head of
intel for bad intel but i doubt it
i think that's also uh propaganda
do you think that putin has actually
fired generals
and
put his own intelligence head under
house arrest
i think no
i mean the news is saying it but i think
no
yeah that feels like propaganda to me
firing generals is how we won world war
ii though yeah i see what you're saying
all right here's a source
of uh russian tanks
battle tanks 2800 what
okay it's too confusing
give me the give me the summary
all right
i think my take is going to remain
the contrary intake let me ask you this
if you took the contrarian view of every
single thing
that's been in the news how often would
you be right
versus if you took the standard view
and then you waited long enough
who would be right more often the
standard view and let's say last five
years
would the standard view have been more
right or more wrong than the
the generic view
now
sometimes we underestimate the generic
view you know the classic view because
most of the world said russia was going
to invade ukraine right and then they
did so i'd say the classic view is
correct the contrarian view of which i
don't know anybody but me
who had was that he was bluffing
now the contrarian view turned out to be
completely wrong he invaded
now the the reason i thought he wouldn't
is because there was obviously a suicide
mission but apparently the story is and
i don't i don't think you can trust the
story that the only reason he made such
a bad mistake is that his intelligence
people gave him bad information
but
i wouldn't have made that mistake
and i didn't listen to any intelligence
people
i just said
it's 2022 and ukraine is going to be
armed with
all the modern equipment nato can give
it it's probably a bad idea to attack
that was my opinion
i didn't need any deep dive to come up
with that
and it and indeed it's looking like a
pretty bad idea
oh greenwald and matt tybee said he
wouldn't they both said that
i wonder if they were using the same
logic
which is it's obviously a stupid idea
but he did it
now if he pulls it off then i guess i
suppose it looks brilliant in hindsight
but at the moment it's looking like a
terrible thing
um the us and nato manipulated this
whole thing
yeah there's there's a lot we don't know
about this ukraine situation if you know
what i mean number one we don't know
what ukraine has been used for
by
people in the united states and the
government
i feel as if we've been using ukraine
for a number of illicit things and maybe
we'll never know what they were
i also think that
it's not crazy to think
that russia was lured into the attack
intentionally
that's not crazy
or at least that it was one possibility
that we didn't hate
in other words we weren't trying to stop
it from happening because we thought
well if he does if he does attack it's
going to be bad for russia and maybe
somebody thought that was a good idea
yeah and the question is why is the
state department always been so
interested in ukraine
why is ukraine this poor little country
so important to america
it's not obvious is it
like there's something going on there
that we don't know about
yeah it looks like somebody wanted a war
it does look like that
is it just oil and gas i don't know
all right here's a question for you
let's say 30 of the world's wheat
disappeared
what would happen
would poor people starve
because rich people pay more for the
wheat so there's no none available
or would the rich people stop eating
bread
which would happen
if you said to me scott
there's a worldwide shortage of wheat
would you mind cutting back on wheat
because it's not that healthy for you
anyway
and you you could go a few months
without bread you could go a year
without bread because you got plenty of
carbs just
eat less wheat
scott would you do that
to help starving people across the world
to which i would say sure
yeah i could do that easily
i could cut bread out i mean i like
bread so i'd miss it but if you know if
it's it's a war thing yeah of course i
could cut out bread
but would i
and would anybody ever ask me to
i don't think anybody would ask me
because it's a free country
and
i don't know it'd work if anybody asked
yeah i don't think most of you would cut
out bread i think you'd let people
starve
switch to corn and rice
so
yes grow your own bread damn it
um donnie says you lost 50 pounds by
cutting out wheat that's pretty much my
weight loss technique i have
two weight loss
techniques
um
zelensky starred in a tv show about a
school teacher who becomes president of
the ukraine the owner of the tv network
financed his real-life election campaign
yeah zelensky does look like
he looks like a creation doesn't he
because he is
so you know two
two presidents who were
both came out of reality tv or this one
not reality tv
um
he also won the ukraine dancing with a
star show
i don't know
i don't trust anything about zelinski
does anybody agree with me
i don't i don't trust zelinski at all
at all
because i don't know who's running him
exactly is he just a cia guy
i don't know
here's another comment for five dollars
uh yeah ukraine is a hotbed of
corruption
money laundering traffic yeah
all right um i don't have much to say
today
so unless you have any questions for me
i'm going to keep it short
since you're all tired from the time
change remember
move your clocks if you forgot to do it
last night
oh here's some information on
oh here we go uh
russian stuff so
russia has in the active horses 2800
battle tanks but in reserves over 16
000.
but then they have lots of infantry and
armored personnel carriers so they've
got 18 000 armored personnel carriers if
you count the reserves
so
if you've got 17 000 stingers
and 18 000 uh troop carriers
it seems like you could get rid of a lot
of troops
per
anti-tank weapon i assume they would
work on a troop carrier
when will she go full putin i don't know
i don't feel like
china would make this mistake
china is just more conservative in a
good way in a good way that works for
them
uh people keep forgetting artillery the
trouble is artillery isn't going to let
you
conquer and keep something
my next book still working on it
yeah yeah i don't think china is going
to sacrifice itself for russia for sure
that's not going to happen
all right
um i believe i've said everything that's
useful to say
and now i'm just
riffing and although some of you are
hoping that i would last long enough for
you to complete your workout
i say to you that you are strong enough
to complete this workout even without
coffee with scott adams
even without
and uh
is there anything i forgot today
any topics i should have talked about
somebody wants a daylight savings time
sip and i think that that is called for
daylight savings time
well at least in the united states
daylight savings time
sip
because i don't know about you but i'm a
little under slept today
go
ah yeah
yeah that's good
well i think you would agree that this
is the best thing that's ever happened
to you in the history of your life
and uh
um we don't serve penis on this flight
okay i got it
bill maher on ben shapiro's show is that
going to happen or are you just saying
you wish it would happen
uh trump on rogue and that doesn't seem
to be confirmed does it
i saw that trump cleverly was uh
praising joe rogan
he said he shouldn't apologize but he
thought rogan would be better
to host a presidential debate
than chris wallace to which i say
i would watch that
let me be serious
i think that an independent podcaster
should
host a debate
whether it's joe rogan that's a separate
question
but i think an independent podcaster
should host a presidential debate
or at the very least
the presidential candidates should make
a real effort to
appear on
the major podcast
i'll tell you something that i learned
promoting books
if you go on abc good morning america
and promote your book
do you know how many you'll sell
none
none i i would watch my amazon rank when
i would do publicity hits and i go on
like a major network tv big hit
they mentioned the book
nothing literally nothing no change at
all
you go on joe rogan show or you go on
tim ferriss
james eltashir
you go on a major podcast and boop as
soon as it comes out you see your see
your numbers start to spike
so i would assume
that the politicians have seen the same
thing by now
and if whoever runs for president works
the the podcast network
because it's so easy to do you don't
even have to be there
you could just you know zoom and knock
out five of them in one day
and they would get massive traffic
and they the podcast
format does allow you to change minds
do you agree with that i would say that
regular news the way it's formatted with
you know 30 seconds of pundits yelling
at each other never changes anybody's
minds
but i do believe
that a conversation between a candidate
and a smart
uh podcaster an independent
would actually change minds i think some
people would watch the program say you
know i hadn't thought about it that way
it has something to do with who listens
to podcasts versus who watches network
tv right
the people who go to an independent
podcast
they're actually looking to have their
opinion changed
is that do you think that's too too far
i would say the people who watch network
news
are looking for a confirmation of their
opinion
people who listen to podcasters also
might be listening for for confirmation
but far more it would attract people who
are willing to change their mind and
able
both willing and able which is rare
yeah
i think if you're looking for
alternative points of view you're
spring-loaded to have your mind changed
and you'd be okay with that
so
this could be the year that the
politicians realize what every person
who sells books already realizes that
network news is just a confirmation bias
engine
and podcasting is really the only
the only tool out there for changing
anybody's mind i think
would you agree it's the only tool to
change a mind at the moment
is there anybody who's well let's test
it out
is there anybody watching this on
youtube or locals
who have had their mind changed on
anything on any topic
by watching this podcast
now watch the comments
all right on locals it's just a stream
of yeses
uh on youtube
also some yeses
talking about podcasts specifically and
live streams same thing
right look at all the yeses
now i assume that people are not
answering or probably knows so i'm not
saying that it's a majority yes but how
many people would answer that yes for
watching cnn
how many people watch cnn and say yeah
you know
cnn changed my mind i used to be
pro this but now i'm anti that i'll bet
not
i'll bet not
because they're they're really careful
about keeping their topics what their
audience already thinks they're not
trying to change their minds
so
have i made my case i think i have right
you saw in the comments themselves
that podcasts do change opinions
and i don't think it's some magic that i
bring to the podcast i think that
you know i think if tim poole asked his
audience they would say the same thing
do you think joe rogan
i'll bet his audience would say the same
thing now i try harder to change minds
than they do you know i don't think
they're trying to change your mind i
think they're presenting entertainment i
actually am trying to change your mind
in a lot of cases not every case in the
case of vaccinations i didn't want to
change your mind
i just wanted to present it in a way you
could make your own decision
that's why the dems want rogan go on you
might be right
[Music]
yeah it has something to do with being
able to explain something in detail and
have some back and forth
that this model allows for
um
all right
now
how many of you would like to see me
moderate a presidential debate
serious question
because i could probably do it
i could probably pull it off
you know if it's on zoom
if it's just on zoom i could probably do
it
um
well i think i think people are
answering from the entertainment
perspective
i i feel like i could do the best job
all right let me back up before i say
this
um i pride myself
no even that's wrong
i i try to make it a point i won't say i
pride myself
uh
all right i'm not even going to finish
that point
uh can
alright well i will finish the point in
my opinion i would be the best
combination of asking good questions and
being entertaining
because you have to be entertaining to
get the audience
but you should ask good questions
because it's also a public service if
you're talking to presidential
candidates
your your brain should be in public
service mode not in entertainment mode
right
if you're a good person at all
you should be in purely public service
mode by the time you're talking to
legitimate candidates for the presidency
but
i'm pretty sure i could do a good job
and also be entertaining
just because i'd ask interesting
questions
i also think
that if i uh interviewed any candidate
for president one-on-one
that i could get inside their head
faster than almost anybody
and when i say inside their head i mean
get them to
get get them out of politician mode
and get them into human mode
i think i could do that faster than just
about anybody could do that
and again it's just technique
right i'm not saying i have magic powers
that i was born with i'm saying that
anybody who
studied certain certain techniques of
persuasion communication et cetera would
be good at it that's all
uh head trip yeah
no i actually think i
i think if i made it my
my mission in life
to host a presidential debate
i think i could do it
i think i could pull it off because i do
think there's enough appetite for it
there would be enough of an audience for
it
you know you wouldn't have to worry
about enough people watching
there'd be plenty of people watching
um
jordan peterson too you say
good luck convincing the candidates well
do you think i could convince trump
who thinks i couldn't convince trump to
do a
a podcast with me
i could i could convince trump
it'd be great for him because
because what i would do for both
candidates is let them
show them in their best light
i would be challenging but i would also
let them you know really show themselves
in their best light that's the point of
it really
you know i'd be tough
but i'm not trying to destroy anybody so
do you think trump could um
could let's say thrive
in that environment of course he could
of course could you know and trump knows
me because he met me so he would know
he'd have he'd have a sense of me i
don't think he'd be afraid of anything
bad happening
um
now whether the democrat candidate would
do it who do you think the democrat
candidate is going to be by the way
give me your best bet
democrat candidate for president
i don't think hillary
don't think beethoven i don't think
i don't think kamala
um not michelle
clubacher buddha judge
i don't know
aya
i don't know if any of them are really
i really have a chance
smolit
aoc
newson
all right well
let's let's pick governor newsom would
governor newsom agree to a debate that i
moderated
i don't know
good question
i'm a californian so maybe i'd have like
a little bit of
a little bit of edge
you know so here's the thing i would not
agree to
host a presidential debate
unless i was dead serious about giving
them both you know equal treatment
like i'd have to be dead serious about
that
but you know of course people would
assume i didn't after they watched it
because that's the way it works
but i'd be serious about it whether i
pulled it off or not
all right um
why do i think michelle obama isn't now
i don't think anybody's ready to
uh elect somebody who doesn't have
actual government service because
remember when people were saying the
same thing about hillary clinton
they said that before she was a senator
before she was secretary of state she
had to she had to go through the
the work
to become a presidential candidate
um
why would i want to yeah why would she
want to it's a good question i think it
would be all bad for the obamas if
michelle ran
i can't see it happening
biden again i don't know all right
that's all for now youtube and i'll talk
to you
tomorrow
