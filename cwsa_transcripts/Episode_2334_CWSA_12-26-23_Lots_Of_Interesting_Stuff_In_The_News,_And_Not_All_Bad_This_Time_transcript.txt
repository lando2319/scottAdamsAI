good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization post
Christmas 2023 version everybody survive
everybody have a good time good well if
you'd like to take your experience up to
levels that have never been experienced
before all you need is a copper mugger
glass a tanker cheler Stein a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
end of the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous zp
savor it
go yeah the savoring is
good well I saw another idea that AI is
going to change the world uh from the X
account of Prince of fakes bri.
a um he wants a uh an AI company that
will build him a uh a sex toy for a
men that will talk so he wants his sex
toy to be able to talk to him like AI
talks
to and he he's hoping that somebody will
build one of those in 20124
but um I have some advice for you never
buy version 1.0 so I'm going to wait for
the sex toy that's an upgrade to the
talking one uh the one that doesn't
talk so I'm going to wait for version
two once they get rid of that talking
bug because I don't want to talking to
me so if we can get rid of that version
2.0 I wait for that if I'm you well
Trump had a nice beautiful little
Christmas
message uh which had had him railing
against all of his enemies and haters
and he finished up his uh Christmas
message with in all caps may they rot in
hell again Merry
Christmas
okay is is it just me or is everything
he does
funny he rails against he rails against
his enemies for Christmas of all days
and then he ends it with may they rotten
hell again Mary
Christmas so this is a pattern he likes
to
do uh where he says bad things and then
good things at the same time it's very
funny and I like the fact that it makes
all of his
haters can't kind of draw attention to
it
anyway uh R in reports that uh latest
latest polling shows that Trump has a
command lead in the primaries he's got a
51% of likely Republican primary voters
compared to number two I guess is Nikki
Hy now at 13 so I guess Ronda santis is
a non- entity these
days uh but how do you explain that in
the National
poll uh Haley is way behind Trump but
allegedly allegedly in New Hampshire
she's kind of close
how do you explain
that well I like to use my uh my
explaining method called follow the the
money let me ask you this if you could
if you had the ability to bribe your way
into one fake
pole and you know there hundreds of
polls happening all the time but if
there were just one pole that you could
somehow bribe them or pay for it to be
distorted what would be the very best
one to
do I'm thinking New
Hampshire wouldn't that be the the
number one most valuable thing to
corrupt because everybody's always
looking for the New Hampshire now I
would have said Iowa but I think New
Hampshire is
smaller and it's the small the smallness
which suggests it be easier to corrupt I
don't know if that's true but it
suggests it
so I wouldn't believe any New Hampshire
poll it has nothing to do with the
specific people who are running it it
just has to do with the fact that if
there were any one poll that you really
want really wanted to be corrupted that
would be the one that that's the one
that because it's going to get headlines
and and the News likes shift in momentum
stories they don't like well he's still
a head story so much but they love oh
somebody came from behind The Comeback
Kid so New Hampshire is all about
creating the artificial come from behind
story that's all it is because New
Hampshire is not a representative of the
country am I right the country doesn't
look like New Hampshire so whatever
happens in New Hampshire shouldn't tell
you anything about anything so the only
purpose is to get a surprise
that's it you just have to get a
surprise and it's the cheapest place to
buy a surprise again I'm not I'm not
saying anybody did that I don't have any
evidence of that I'm just saying your
critical news
watching uh you know your critical mind
should ask the question what would be
the most likely poll to be corrupted
it's got to be that one of all the polls
in the world it's got to be that one but
I don't have any evidence that it
is all right
um
Argentina is an interesting situation
now with the new
president and I saw an account or report
that he was kicked off of Instagram is
that true did the new president of
Argentina get kicked off of
Instagram for what I don't know is that
even true I guess I need a fact check on
that but um if so it would once again
show the importance of X as the last
remaining Free Speech
place he's back on Instagram oh so it
probably was a mistake wasn't it oh yeah
I think I heard somewhere that there was
no explanation why he got kicked off
meaning it might not have been political
might have been a dirty trick or
something that they
reversed
okay
all right well maybe that's already
fixed there's a brand new blood test
that can detect cancer in two hours and
it doesn't cost much it's like just a
few
bucks um wouldn't that change everything
a blood test that can accurately find
cancer in two hours and it doesn't cost
much for the test wouldn't you do that
test after a certain age wouldn't you do
that test every three months it's only
three bucks you know a few
bucks yeah I don't think it's you know
it's not quite ready for the market but
apparently it passed some tests so
that's pretty awesome could be a big
Improvement in
2024 I'd like to give you once again my
uh my periodic warning don't fall for
the love language is Con you know that
idea that people have a different love
language some some people can only be
they can only feel love if you give them
let's say quality time that's one love
language or gifts or acts of service or
physical touch uh words of affirmation I
think there might be another one I'm
missing but everybody apparently has
their preferred way they want to receive
love it's a con don't fall for
it and if anybody ever tells you their
love language is acts of service or
gifts they're try to get a free
Butler don't go for the free Butler oh
if only I do everything She Wants she'll
love me if I also buy her stuff so if I
buy her gifts and then do everything she
wants she will love me no that's not
really love that's a trick yeah run away
from that as fast as you can let me tell
you uh now uh to be fair I got some uh
push back from an author Andrew
Christian who said when I said this on X
this morning he said you offer much
wisdom Scott but relationship Mastery is
not in your skill
stack is that
fair is it fair to say relationship
Mastery is not part of my
expertise I think that's half right
here's the half that's right I cannot
tell you how to make a relationship
work nope no
idea the the best I have for you is that
when two good people meet
young and get together when they're
young often it works great I
hear otherwise I don't have any advice
no advice whatsoever but I would like to
push back on Andrew's comment that I
have I have not mastered relationship
skill I would say I very much know what
doesn't work
because relationships are two parts what
works and then avoiding what doesn't
work you don't think I'm an expert on
what doesn't work come on who are you
going to
ask test me you give me give me a
standardized test on what doesn't work
well I'm going to get 100% on that one
now if you give me another test of what
does work I'll be
like know I feel like it just depends on
the two people
if you have two good
people and they have some you know
chemical attraction probably it works
every time just because they're good
people you know people who can consider
the other person's feelings and then
adjust on their own without being told
to you know like good functioning people
that probably works every time but if
you only have one functioning person or
no functioning people I don't think your
love language is going to fix that yeah
well you're an abusive alcoholic but
maybe if I gave you
gifts maybe maybe that would turn things
around no no your Abus of
alcoholic gifts are not going to turn it
around all
right
um let's see uh here's another follow
the money for
you uh how many of you are alarmed you
should be that Insurance actuarials are
saying that there's a lot of excess
death how many of you are alarmed by
insurance company experts who really are
the ones you trust right because they
they have to you know base their entire
economics on get being
right so the I believe it's the
insurance companies who are telling us
there's excess mortality am I right can
you give me a fact
check it's the insurance companies who
have the most
reliable
credible uh data that says we have
excess mortality that we can't explain
right and somebody on X said well it
must be true because you're hearing it
from the companies that have to get it
right is that fair let me let me give
you a test these are companies that have
to get it right so therefore they're the
most credible source for whether or not
there's excess mortality
right yeah okay well there might be one
problem with that do you know how
insurance companies set their rates does
anybody know how they set their rates
it's based on what their risk is yeah so
they set the rates based on the
perceived risk if the if the mortality
rate was exactly the same every year
what would their rates
be same every year same because the
mortality rate would be the same now
they'd adjust for maybe inflation or
maybe competitive forces but basically
if it's based on how many people are
dying
flat right now if you're an insurance
company what would your
economic interest
suggest would it suggest that if you
said I think in the future there and in
the past recently there's a lot of
excess
deaths hey all those excess deaths what
are we going to do with our rates I've
got an idea why don't we substantially
raise our rates because of all the
excess deaths because we're going to
have to pay pay these people when they
die for the life insurance right so how
many of you fell for believing the
people who have the greatest incentive
to lie to you the insurance companies
the greatest economic incentive to lie
to you how many of you said to yourself
well that's a good
source how many of you fell for
that did you fall for that that the good
source is the one who has the greatest
incentive to light you because they have
a direct a direct Financial benefit to
light
you all right I would like to raise my
hand and acknowledge my
stupidity that it took me till today to
realize that honestly
idiot I could not be more disappointed
myself it took me until
today literally this morning I said huh
wait a minute if if the insurance
companies convinced us that there's a
lot of excess
mortality I'm going to have to pay more
for my wait a minute wait a
minute is anybody having the same
experience right now where you just
assume the actuarials would be the good
data it couldn't possibly be true
because literally everybody is
influenced by money how would you like
to be the Actuarial who who under who
under projected deaths you're
fired suppose you over projected
deaths
promotion because you you set the rates
at The Highest Potential uh
profitability rate and you got away with
it promotion
bonus all right I don't know what's true
about xss so I'm not going to tell you
that it's not true I'm just going to
tell you that if your source is
actuarials not credible not even a
little bit credible follow the money it
always
works all right um another study shows
us what I think we all suspected that um
loneliness may increase your risk of
death so there's a new study about this
uh Lindsay Kobayashi in the proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences
something out of the University of
Michigan and it basically says that
loneliness seems strongly implicated in
dying
now while there are certainly questions
about the safety of the
vaccinations always good to have those
questions and there are questions about
any long Co and we we certainly know
about obesity and less um
maybe we're a little less
active we know that there are more
suicides and there's more fental and all
that but if I had to pick one variable
that's been underappreciated it's the
loneliness
thing how many of you have experienced
bad
Health that was instantly solved by
having
somebody uh just come over and say
hi I've actually experienced that lately
I've actually experienced my body like
just feeling terrible and then you have
some social interaction that's positive
and your entire physicality
changes
instantly instantly just your entire
physicality changes now I would be
amazed if loneliness doesn't kill people
because the way I actually feel when I
have that feeling of loneliness is like
there's a weight on my chest and every
part of my you know vital systems is
starting to shut down because I think
when you're lonely you don't feel any
reason to
live now lots of people like being alone
which is different I'm not talking about
people like being alone that can be a
plus but if you're lonely and you really
need people and you're not getting them
I feel like you just don't have a reason
to
live and I do have a dog a dog doesn't
doesn't help that much you know it's
better than nothing but yeah dog doesn't
help your human
loneliness anyway so I think that's
probably uh one of the big variables I
think the excess if there is excess uh
mortality it's probably several
reasons
several all right axios reports there's
a home
shortage so we're short about 3.2
million homes which is why our prices
are staying High
now why in the world in a place like
America would there ever be a shortage
of something so basic as a
home and it's not even that people can't
afford them apparently just a shortage
of
them now it's not Black Rock because
Black Rock buys them and then instantly
rents them out so all the homes that are
bought by the big hedge funds they they
actually have them rented before they
buy them did you know that that they
actually arrange for the renters and
then they go buy the homes so they're
instantly rented so they're actually
they're actually increasing the rate of
people in homes they're not decreasing
it it's just that they're put in
rentals yeah
so uh I don't think that they're
distinguishing between rentals and
owning a home they're just saying
they're not enough
homes but this is entirely a government
Pro problem isn't
it
let let me ask you this if you were to
make a list of problems the government
solved it'd be a pretty serious list but
if you made a separate list of problems
the government created it'd be a pretty
big list too wouldn't it like every time
the government gets in the way of um the
free market and that's obviously What's
Happening Here uh it's all
bad so I'm going to say it for the
billionth time
I think robots will be big and AI will
be big of course but one of the
biggest sources of economic uh activity
is going to be completely rebuilding
homes putting these little uh pre-made
Factory adus you know the little
backyard in-law homes they're going to
be wild I mean they're going to go crazy
that Market's going to be huge and I saw
yet another
uh I saw yet another uh Instagram
real in which there's some it looks like
a Mexican company it was in Spanish so I
couldn't tell the details but they're
making bricks so they have machines that
look like they're manual where you just
put the right amount of dirt and water
or whatever you put in there and then
you you press down and you make a
brick but one of the machines that I saw
it makes a brick that's like a
Lego so the the process of stacking them
is as simple as you put it on top and it
goes exactly where it's supposed to and
you're you're kind of done I think you
pour some concrete over it or something
so now you can make your own bricks
without an electricity no electricity
needed and the bricks are you to just
fit together so anybody can be a a brick
layer
basically so I think that that and about
a million other um things are going to
have us not only so here's the key to my
prediction it won't be just that we'll
build new h homes and let's say new
cities but we will have to completely
tear down and rebuild existing homes to
make them as good as the new ones
because the existing ones are going to
look like garbage once new ones are
doing what they need to do they're going
to be so much less expensive to maintain
and all that so I think there's going to
be a u remodeling surge like you've
never seen
before and it will be good for
employment for probably 10 years
that's what I
say
um Wall Street Journal is reporting that
the coch family or cotch how do you say
him K C how do you pronounce that I
always read it but I never hear it
Coke all right it's pronounced like Coke
K C anyway it's the Koch family and its
network of donors say the Wall Street
Journal are starting to back Nikki
Elli why is it that everything looks
exactly like you think it
is what why does it look exactly like
you suspected that the big
industrialists are going to back Nikki
Haley and the military industrial
complex it kind of looks exactly like it
looks doesn't
it so we'll see how that goes all right
let's talk about Israel Nan Yahoo has a
three conditions for peace number one
destroy Hamas number two demilitarize
Gaza and number three deprogram the
Palestinians deprogram them well uh I
think he used the word
deradicalize deradicalize but that's
sort of deprogram but deradicalize
sounds uh less
provocative because everybody's in favor
of der radicalizing but not everybody
would be in favor of
brainwashing same thing it's going to
require brainwashing to
deradicalize
um so here's what I think about that
what is missing in the three-point plan
is who's going to run Gaza and the West
Bank isn't he leaving out who's in
charge after it's
done I the most important part how are
you going to accomplish keeping Hamas
destroyed demilitarizing it and and
keeping it that way at deprogramming
Palestinians unless Israel has full
control of it it's the only way they're
going have to full control anybody who
thought the two-state
solution was ever an option it really
never was and I'm going to tell you the
reason that nobody else is going to tell
you here's why the two-state solution
was never an option because the parties
involved didn't want
it they both wanted a one stay solution
where they
won surprise and they both prefer the
fight to the
peace now when I say they I don't mean
every citizen every the citizens of both
Israel and Gaza probably a lot of the
citizens don't want to fight probably a
lot but the governments are a different
situation let me tell you what I would
do if I were
Israel every time the Palestinians did
something horrible I would take some
more of their
land
because it's like a free punch oh all
right if you're going to attack us we'll
keep your land oh if you're going to
attack us again I guess we'll keep your
land again so Israel has this strategy
where if they just allow the
Palestinians to do what the Palestinians
apparently want to do which is
elect mil militaristic leaders and have
them threaten Israel that Israel will
just do the obvious natural thing which
is use those provocations to their
advantage so I think Israel is
growing and if you were to fast forward
a 100 years into the future and you were
to look back at this period you would
say to yourself I hate to tell you that
Netanyahu is going to be like Thomas
Jefferson right Thomas Jefferson doing
the Louisiana Purchase increasing the
size of the United States Netanyahu is
going to look like that in a 100 years
right I mean there'll always be two
stories about him there'll be the good
one and the bad one but if he succeeds
in basically completely controlling Gaza
and completely filling the West Bank
with settlements until it's a de facto
you know Israeli country um then it's
going to look like it was one of the
biggest successes of a country in the
history of countries in 100 years at the
moment it just looks you know like hey
hey why can't you get along you know we
don't understand why you can't get along
well why you can't get along is that
Israel benefits from taking advantage of
the bad
stuff now Glennon
Greenwald tells us
provocatively that it's always been the
uh the Israelis who turned down the two
State peace
deals have you always been told that it
was the uh the PLO and the Palestinians
who were always turning down the great
peace
deals is that your understanding what's
happened it was always the Palestinians
they would get these great deals and
then they would turn them down right
well Gren Glenn Greenwald will tell you
it's the opposite so which is it does
Glenn Greenwald have the accurate story
that it's always been Israel because
Greenwald says that netanyahu's bragged
about killing the two State
solution that he's actively bragged
about it in
public do you believe
that here's what I believe I believe
that it doesn't matter if Netanyahu
killed it or not because it wouldn't
have
worked what's the
difference yeah I'm not sure he's the
bad guy because it wouldn't have worked
it would have just given the other side
time to rebuild build up their military
and then they would have attacked and it
just would have turned into this
eventually you know the October 7th was
going to happen any way you look at it
so I don't think a two-stage solution
was ever possible and I'm going to give
you the uh inarguable answer
why and I'm going to call this
Schrodinger's
Jew Schrodinger's Jew you've heard of
Schrodinger's cat right it's a famous
experiment in physics where the cat um
if the cat's in his sealed box and
there's some poison there that will
randomly be uh either uh Reeve the the
poison will either uh be active or not
but it's random if you're outside the
box the phys physicists argue well you
don't know if the cat is alive or dead
but until it's observed or
measured is both that the cat exists in
a transposition of both being both alive
and dead now as as far as I can tell
that's the only way to solve peace in
the Middle East because it turns out
that too many of the Palestinians not
all of them of course but too many of
them would only be happy when the Jews
are all
dead now the Jews I haven't asked them
but I'm almost positive that they'd be
happier if they
lived so you have two
unsolvable things here one is you must
all be dead
and the other is well we prefer to live
so I think that the only way you can
have a peace deal is Shing your
Jews where the Palestinians believe that
they've killed all the Jews and yet the
Jews are living happily completely alive
and
safe
so yeah in other words it's impossible
so every every minute you spend wasted
talking about a two-state solution is
just a waste of time there is no
two-state solution except for the Absurd
you know that the Jews are both alive
and dead so that everybody can get what
they want right it's not
possible so Schrodinger's Jew I'm adding
that to the conversation so stop talking
about a two- State Solution that's never
going to
happen all right um but can uh Netanyahu
do these three things can he destroy
Hamas I say mostly yes it might be like
a 95% thing not 100% thing but mostly
yes if they put enough you know
resources that it they can probably get
close to it can they
demilitarize yes as long as Israel
maintains full military control of the
area if they let somebody else do it uh
maybe not but yes it's doable very hard
but doable but can they deprogram the
pal
Palestinians oh here's the question well
this is my domain persuasion so let me
tell you the definitive
answer you can't reprogram the older
people too late everything you tell them
will just turn into cognitive dissonance
and a reason why it's not true so the
older people can't be can't be
fixed but let's say people under
25 it did I say this on the live stream
yesterday I don't remember I might be
repeating myself but can you reprogram
children how hard is it to reprogram
children and the answer is really easy
simple children are like a light switch
you can turn them on and you can turn
them off just as fast so yes if you if
you put the right uh kind of effort into
it you can change a kid into to any
belief you
want and I'm not talking about
six-year-old kids I'm talking about
19-year olds 20y olds 25 it it starts
falling off really quickly after their
brains are formed you know up to 25
they're still a little flexible after
that the flexibility goes away pretty
quickly now if you can keep weapons away
from the older you know
militants you know make make them unable
to do what they might want to do and you
can retrain the younger people and the
teens there is a way
forward but can you do those things
could you get enough control over the
schools to teach them that they've been
had now um oh so David let me clarify so
David King says this guy is insane so if
you're doubting if you're doubting my
statement that even the Palestinian
children can be completely reversed let
me let me tell you how easy it
is you'd have to find the right lever
and the right lever that works with all
young people is the old people had been
lying to you before that'll work every
time because young people are already
primed to believe that old that the
older generation is lying to them we we
don't need to be
convinced it's the easiest thing in the
world uh I can reprogram every
Palestinian kid in like 30 minutes if if
you know if I could cause them to listen
to me I could do it now I'd probably
have to be you know dressed up like a a
Muslim cleric or something you know it
have to be coming from somebody credible
but all I have to do is say here's
here's the bank accounts of the uh
leaders of
Hamas here's their bank accounts this
one's guy's got a billion dollars here's
the here's the yacht of this other one
now what what if I made it all up would
they know no they wouldn't know I could
literally just make that up uh here's
the actual bank account and it just made
it up on my printer you just show it to
the kids hey kids this is the actual
bank account right here look they took
all your money you guys are starving and
they started this war and they did it
for nothing because Israel is your
friend and they just want to live in
peace but they told you that they
weren't and they gave you this whole
story where you had to kill them but it
was all kind of a trick so they can make
money and they're really just broken
evil people and you shouldn't follow
them how how hard is it to get a kid to
believe they've been uh they've been
abused by an adult it's easy you just
say it
once you with with adults you have to
like keep hammering them you got you got
to repeat and repeat and repeat if you
want to persuade them not with a kid a
kid you could just tell them once done
you know here's the proof that they were
a con people they were just con men the
whole time they were not really your
your legitimate leaders and they took
all your money and they left you in ruin
just say it
once you you you would reprogram a kid
immediately do you know why here's what
kids believe you ready for this here's
what kids
believe the last thing they heard
that's it now you know everything about
persuading children they believe the
last thing they
heard unless there's you know something
sticky about it that that's got them
stuck to it so if they don't if they
don't have some objective other way to
know what's
true and an adult says your history was
wrong so we're revising the history
lesson now this is the correct lesson
what's a kid going to say they're going
to to believe the new one instantly
uncritically because they have not been
abused enough that they know that
everything is a lie all the time which
is what adults know by the time you're
my age you know everything is a lie all
the
time everything is a lie all the time
kids don't know that they still think
there's a true true version and a fake
version so yeah you could do totally
deprogram them if you had full control
of the schools
all right
um apparently uh looks like Israel I
don't know if US helped but they did a
drone attack and they took out an top
Iranian General Brigadier General razi
musavi uh and they took him out in
Damascus in
Syria so the Iranians of course were not
too happy about that so there have been
some Iranian proxies attacking some
American assets over there and some
Americans got killed and then the us is
going to attack back or already
has so we're in a proxy war with
Iran um and I guess the question is how
big it
gets so my guess would be it's going to
stay small because I think Iran just
needs to show that they're pushing back
the United States needs to show that you
know they're not going to get away with
it Israel is going to take as easy shots
of the generals who leave Iran because
they don't want to kill their generals
who are in Iran that would be too much
of a provocation so I feel like again
everybody's getting what they want so
it's not going to change you know Iran
wants to poke the United States and
that's sort of the whole thing they know
the United States isn't going to pack up
and leave they just want to poke them
and the US needs to respond so they're
going to respond so everybody's getting
what they want Iran's going to poke
we're going to respond Israel is going
to kill any generals that leave
Iran I don't know that that leads to
war because it's sort of like people
getting what they wanted in the short
run that doesn't seem to me that that
would escalate but I could be very wrong
about that we'll see I saw a report from
Joel Pollock in Breitbart that Israel
has seized 30,000 explosives in Gaza
strap that includes uh Rockets I guess
so I we don't know how much of that is
Rockets but 30,000
explosives that would do some
damage um but the amazing thing to me is
that Gaza is still launching Ro uh
Rockets
um
yeah I'm being asked here if I Think
Jesus was the greatest human Persuader
ever born into man
kind um I'd say no because he didn't
write the Bible so it was the writing of
the Bible that you know there's
something about the way it's written
this seems to be the persuasive part so
I would I would
say uh the historical Jesus if we assume
there was a real Jesus was probably very
persuasive very persuasive but the the
real persuasion was the
book because most of us never met Jesus
but we saw the
book
um anyway so that's what's happening
over
there uh bunch of protests planned I
guess there's a protest planned for the
Holocaust
Museum so the pro Palestinians are
allegedly going to protest at the
Holocaust Museum does that sound true to
you
that doesn't sound
true you know what it sounds
like it sounds like um an
OP it sounds like maybe somebody who's
pro-israeli possibly an American
somebody who's pro-israeli has put
together a fake
protest uh marketing saying hey
everybody meet at the Holocaust Museum
to protest it because I can't think of
anything that would be more pro- Israel
and pro-
Jew than tricking the Palestinians into
protesting the Holocaust
Museum can you think of anything that
would be more pro-israel than
that that would be the
single best op I've ever seen how hard
would it be to put together a fake
protest you maybe you bribe one person
who's a organizer or something or maybe
you just do it yourself just put up the
signs because if you're just a protester
you don't know who put up the sign do
you you don't know who started the viral
thing on Tik Tok to show up at the
Holocaust Museum I think the whole thing
might be a
trick because I'm trying to
imagine I'm trying to imagine the
organizers who are actually the pro
Palestinian organizers I can't imagine
them thinking that's a good
idea what what be obvious that's the
worst thing to
do like really really
obvious yeah like unite the right
absolutely it's exactly like
that yep yep somebody somebody said in
the comments is it like you unite the
right that was the Charleston or um
charville the Char will fine people
march yeah that that will fine people
march has
has oper written all over it definitely
they were real racists but the
organization
part that was a little too on the nose a
little too on the nose I don't believe
that was
organic but that's just me all
right um so and I guess there were
protest planned for New Year's Eve and
there were protests on Christmas but but
I saw the protests in New York City
um described as hundreds hundreds of pro
Palestine protester are we too worried
about
hundreds hundreds doesn't sound like a
lot they're getting a lot of attention
but it's
hundreds it's allow 100 I just don't
know how big of this is it might not be
that
big all right um Elon Musk has weighed
in on the Ubi question the universal
basic income and what musk says so the
idea is that uh the government at some
point in our history might need to just
give people money a basic income without
working just so they can buy stuff
otherwise they die uh but mus says there
will be Universal High income not
basic uh in a positive AI future so he
thinks AI will get us to a point where
you would not only have income but you'd
have high income you could kind of buy
whatever you wanted in the in the
ordinary living space anyway couldn't
necessarily buy a you know luxury car
but you could buy everything you needed
in the in the general quality of life
area and mus says there'll be no
scarcity except that which we Define to
be
scarce uh in that scenario everyone can
have whatever goods and service they
want but then musk warns and this is a
good one is less clear how we will find
meaning in a world where work is
optional now of course Elon Musk would
be sensitive to how do you find meaning
in work because his work probably has
more meaning than anybody else I means
literally the the value of his work
could be saving
Humanity you know by Interstellar flight
and saving the climate if the climates
problem so yeah I mean elon's work is
about as me and you know Free Speech
just I even forgot that one I forgot
about preserving free
speech so his work is about the most
meaningful work I've ever seen in my
life uh mine is pretty meaningful at
least how I Define meaning um and I got
to tell you that Christmas was tough for
me because I tried to not work on
Christmas you know except for the live
streams didn't work out for me I I found
myself very unhappy that I wasn't doing
something useful I don't know how to not
be
useful if if I'm not making some kind of
improvement in the world or for somebody
I know or something even a
stranger like I don't really feel good
and I could feel that like on Christmas
really really
acutely so I was happy to get back to
work today
um what do you think do you think we'll
have a point where our biggest problem
is that everything's free and we don't
have any purpose in
life I I feel like we would find a way
to make things not
free like the government would always
get in the way and say oh no you can't
have all free
stuff because it'll make you sad or
something I don't know I I feel like you
can only get the universal High income
in a free free maros
scenario but that we don't have anything
like a free maros so how do you how do
you get there we'll see uh margerie
Taylor green got swatted for the eighth
time on Christmas day I guess they
turned around before they got to her
house because they checked first which
seems
wise um I feel like there needs to be
some kind
of way that the swatters can tell what's
real before they
go this gu be some like code or trick or
secret handshake or I don't know what
the answer is but there ought to be
something that doesn't exist that could
exist yeah like the secret code word but
then you know maybe you're under duress
or something I don't know so I I don't
know defund defund the
police
yeah
um but I do think that the people who
call in the fake swats should be charged
with attempted murder do you
agree that calling in a fake SWAT should
be attempted murder because why else are
you doing it that that's the whole point
is to get somebody killed so that should
be attempted
murder yeah and how do these swap people
not know the location of the
call can you hide the can you hide your
identity and location when you call the
police if you call
911 don't they always know who you are I
don't know the answer to that oh if you
use a VPN I use a VPN okay but for those
of us not using a
VPN I have I have one but for those who
don't have one would they would 911
always know who you are even if your
phone is
unregistered yeah try calling 911 and
hagging up they'll call you back
right well but they got your
number I know I don't know what they
know but that situation needs to get
fixed um also Elon mus talking about
unions he said
uh most of the democratic part is
controlled by the unions they carry far
more weight than the environmentalists
do you think that's true do you think
the unions carry more weight than the
environmentalists probably just CU they
have more
money yeah probably uh certainly the
teachers unions do um and B and mus says
that Biden uh gladly admits it and he
says that must says in Biden's speech uh
he literally says the UAW elected
me the Auto
Workers now think about that and then
Elon says the White House cold shoulder
meaning their coldness to uh Tesla
started well before I said controversial
things in other words the the United
Auto Workers who are not in Tesla so
Tesla's
nonunion but the unionized companies are
competing with Tesla so the unionized
car companies the biggest influence on
the Democrats are basically forcing the
Democrats to diss the car company that's
doing the
most to solve climate
change the it's like really happening in
the real
world in the real world right before our
eyes the Democrats are saying our
biggest thing is climate change it's an
existential threat and then while we
while we watch we watch the United Auto
Workers who are definitely not on that
page saying you know you're going to
have to be bad to Tesla the only
solution to the climate change
problem so the Democrats have created a
system called the Democrats in which
they have their highest
priority they can't work on because of
their highest
influence so their greatest influence
prevents their own party from working on
their own highest
priority how how messed up is
that is that true on the Republicans as
well let me think is there let's see if
we can do this on the Republican side is
there what's the highest priority on the
Republican
side
abortion seems like it's abortion in the
Border abortion in the Border let's say
it's immigration and
abortion uh are the Republicans is there
anything about the Republican party is
there any interest group within the
Republican Party
oh yeah the coch
brothers the coch brothers are
Republicans
right and aren't they sort of in favor
of uh kind of easy immigration because
their companies might need it or am I do
have that wrong I might have that
wrong yeah well I don't think the
Republicans have the same degree of
problem where the highest priority is
made Impossible by the strong EST
influence in their own
party I don't think that's the case
because the strongest influence on the
Republican side still wants a tough
border immigration or yeah border
control so I think Republicans at the
very least are consistent which is their
highest priority is actually backed by
their most influential members is that
fair to say that on the Republican side
their highest priorities immigration and
abortion are pretty much
backed by their most influential members
I see it
no
yeah yeah the the Democrat Party seems
absurd it's absurd in that is so poorly
organized that it's basically just
fighting
itself it looks like you know the the
the ultra wokes fighting the regular
Democrats all right so I don't see that
so much in uh in the Republicans but a
little
bit um now that we know that the reason
there's so much illegal immigration in
the United States and other places is
that there are all these NOS these
non-government organizations in some
cases might be getting funding from
governments but I think they're mostly
getting George Soros funding and rich
people
funding um but they've created this
whole structure to make it really easy
to go illegally from Africa for example
or any other third world country to
America so they organize it they tell
you where to go they tell you how to do
it who to talk to and without it I can't
imagine an African migrating to America
like a a lowincome African because how
would an African even figure out how to
do it how would they afford it how would
they figure out you know the mechanisms
to get here Etc but the NGO is
apparently all that they make sure they
can eat travel get taken care of get to
the right place
now isn't that an act of
War when I look at the border it looks
like an act of War so why is it that the
United States allows
NOS to wage war on the United States is
it because the NGS don't say it's war is
it just they' defined it not as War so
then therefore it's not a war but isn't
it up to us to decide if it's a war
don't we get to decide that yes this
looks like a war I would declare war on
the
Nos and I would declare them uh
terrorist
organizations and I would give them 30
days to stop doing what they're doing
which is making it easy for immigrants
to come here and if they didn't do it I
would kill them all I would kill them
all yeah I would absolutely kill the mo
but militarily with lots of warning and
in the most legal way we can within the
rules of War but I think our CIA could
kill them in their
bed because ass to be stopped yeah so I
I think we need to stop treating the NGS
as charitable
organizations they're just part of a war
machine and they need to be
killed after a warning and only within a
legal a legal context nothing illegal
I'm not suggesting any illegal violence
I'm
suggesting military
self-defense in the context of a direct
and existential threat to the United
States basic ordinary stuff nothing
unusual about it at
all so yeah um and I think Soros has to
be a Target at this point if he's
funding
them I think that George
Soros
specifically if it could be found that
he's the primary one funding the NOS
which are acting essentially like a
military invasion of the United States
that would make him a Target now again
I'm not saying we should just go kill
him in his sleep you should give 30 days
and say you need to stop funding these
following organizations if you do you're
you're part of the military operation
against the United States and then way
to act accordingly and just take him out
but I'm kind of done around are
you can can we just talk
plainly who whoever is behind the mass
immigration into the United States they
need to be
killed but
legally completely legally no illegal X
and I think that the legal justification
is just so
obvious you could get the legal cover
for it in 24 hours if you wanted it so
um am I the first person to say this out
loud I I feel like I am
right
well looks like that went over better
than I thought
so maybe it'll be a
thing all right uh AI is causing a
racism Gap according to axios or might
make one worse so researchers warned
that generative AI could add 43 billion
to America's already Stark racial wealth
Gap yeah because the thing I care about
in every goddamn topic is how it
how it's going to harm my
diversity how about I don't give a
I don't care at
all you know do you know do you know
what else increases um uh unequal
distribution of stuff
everything everything literally
everything do you know what else AI is
going to make
unfair it's going to suck to be over
50 because the over 50s are not going to
you know adopt it as easily as the young
people and the young people will
probably get all kinds of benefits
because they can figure out how to you
know work in that world and the older
people will try to take a pass and
they'll suffer for it how about how
about uh gender how about
gender so we watched the uh internet
Tech Boom turn out to be mostly a male
phenomenon meaning that most of the
employees at the high-end jobs were male
so that so the entire Tech you know
revolution has been
insanely bad for um you know your gap
between gender right didn't it make men
earn more because they were attracted to
stem jobs and women less so and the stem
jobs were great pay so the AI will just
be more of that bad for women bad for
seniors bad for everybody with low IQ at
least until there's Universal High
income I
guess it's going to be bad for all kinds
of people it'll just be good for some
small group of uh
asian-americans who figured out how to
capitalize on it it's going to be
indian-americans and asian-americans are
going to do great in the world of AI and
robots I think white Americans are not
going to be at the top of that
list but um yeah I really don't care if
it causes more of a gap because
everything does just literally
everything does everything
does um all
right now last night in my man cave uh
live stream I showed a
proof that we live in a
simulation now I'm going to ask the
people in the locals platform who saw
the man cave after you thought about it
for a day is it good enough for me to do
it here in front of the live in the
larger audience or would I embarrass
myself I'm just going to wait to see if
they if they think I'll embarrass
myself I got a lot of
nose not not good
enough not
convinced perfect I'm definitely going
to do
it all right here here's the proof we
live in a
simulation now proof of course is
hyperbole because it's you know
nothing's ever proved but uh my
hypothesis is that if you could prove
that history is made on demand you would
have proven that we're a simulation
all right so in other words if you could
prove
somehow that um if you start digging a
hole if you could prove somehow there's
no way to do it but if you could that
there's nothing under the ground until
you start digging and then the reality
is filled in while you dig if you could
prove that would you agree that we're
probably a
simulation does that does the first part
make sense if you could prove that we
create the the past only when we need
it
no you think that our reality would be
the way it looks if you could create the
past on demand if you could create the
past on demand definitely our current
view of reality is is debunked because
it would mean the evolution was fake I
mean everything basically the Big Bang
everything so I'm going to take that as
my starting point if you could prove
that history is created on demand as
opposed to as always was always there
we're simulation now you he the double
slid experiment and you've heard that in
in physics a
particle is sort of only probably
someplace until it's observed you all
know that right it's a weird part of
quantum physics that a particle doesn't
exist until it's either measured by a
machine like an instrument or some kind
of human or conscious
entity now did you ever seem weird to
you that a conscious observation can uh
change a particle into a specific thing
as opposed to a probability
wave but why could a machine do it do
you every think that was weird that you
could just use an instrument to measure
something and then the in strument can
collapse the probability without you
even being there well what that tells
you is is that reality is not
subjective because a machine could do
what a human did collapsing the reality
right so that's that's what that tells
you but here's what's wrong with that uh
with that experiment if you're familiar
with the double slit experiment um if
you want to find out more about this
just Google double slit experiment and
you'll go down a rabbit hole that make
you crazy
but let's say that there are two ways to
collapse probability into a real thing
one is a human and the other is
instruments here's the part that nobody
asked you or told you how do you know
the instrument did
it how do you
know if the instrument did what the
direct observation did how would you
know the instrument did
it well at some point the instrument has
to tell you right a human has to look at
the instrument and say that there it is
that instrument measured it and sure
enough it collapsed
it do you see what's wrong with that it
took me years to figure out what's wrong
with that but I I just figured it out
this week what's wrong with it is in
both cases it's a human observation
you're either directly looking at the
thing and then it collapses into a point
or you look at the machine that looked
at it and it's that point that it
collapses
it's only when you look at the
machine because the machine is just
another way of observing it so in other
words the machine never collapsed
anything what happened was when you
looked at the machine an entire history
that included the machine came into view
and had never existed before so until
you look at the machine's reading it
didn't read
anything you actually caus the past of
the machine read where the point was by
looking at the
machine now your other possibility is
that a machine can collapse
reality maybe but it doesn't make sense
in any way that we can understand
anything but what about if everything is
subjective if everything is
subjective that would make us probably a
simulation but it would also explain why
the chain of events from the instrument
to its reading a a whole chain of uh
actions could be created on demand in
the future and you can recreate the past
so two possibilities either it's all
subjective and always has been or a
machine can collapse reality and then
they're not going to tell you that well
it only does that if a human someday
looks at the
machine if you had a machine that
destroyed itself after measuring
could it do it would it collapse reality
if it destroyed itself after measuring
and nobody could tell the
reading yeah why just human because it's
all in our
imaginations that's why I believe a dog
could also collapse reality if that dog
then interacted with a human who
realized that the dog had collapsed the
reality but it but ultimately you have
to get to the
human so I believe that the double slit
experiment has always been
misinterpreted because humans have a uh
a
block and the block is that they don't
want to believe or scientists don't want
to believe that everything is subjective
and we're living in a in a simulation
since that is too hard to accept they
rather accept through cognitive
dissonance that the machine has
collapsed reality the same way a person
could when a better look at it would be
well not until a human looks at the
machine so it's all just a human so I
think the scientists have a
block that they can't see the obvious
that it's just people it's never been
machines now is any of that true I don't
know it was fun to think about I don't
have any particular uh scientific um
skill
so me being wrong about science would be
the most ordinary thing in the world all
I'm going to add is did you really
believe that machines could collapse
reality just just ask yourself was that
ever
believable it's weird enough that a
person can but at least you can
understand how a person could because it
that would support a subjective reality
simulation kind of world that all Mak
sense but how does the machine do it
it never did the most obvious answer is
it never did it was just scientists
misinterpreting what they were
saying all right and that ladies and
gentlemen concludes the best live stream
of the day
um and uh I'll certainly be here for the
man cave for the subscribers of locals
later
tonight and I hope you have a great day
hope you got all the presents you want
and you you finally away from your
family and you're happy again and I'll
talk to you tomorrow thanks for joining
YouTube see you
tomorrow
