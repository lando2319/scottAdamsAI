right
so how easy is it to make these
arguments
now abortion
uh here's what the republicans have done
wrong with abortion you ready
now and i remind you
that you will not hear my opinion
of whether abortion should be legal or
not
because i leave that to women
you can argue with me all day i just
want to make the point that i'm not
arguing what should or should not be
leave it to women
and
here's what republicans have done
totally wrong
they've allowed the democrats
to paint it as a male versus female
issue
unbelievable unbelief the incompetence
from the republicans to allow that to
happen
unbelievable
there should never be a republican male
who talks about abortion again
you want to be smart
you want to be smart
the first the first time trump says you
know what
how about men just stop talking about it
there are plenty of republican women
let's find some republican women who
want to take the argument
and just get the out of the
argument
get the men out
you don't think trump could win the
entire election by just saying you know
i think it's a little distasteful to
have men talking about abortion
we have strong feelings
but let's let the women take the lead on
this i think we'll get a better outcome
seriously how hard was that
if i already made myself president
how hard was that
