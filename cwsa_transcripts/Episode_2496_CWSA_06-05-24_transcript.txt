[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty pretty sure there's never been a
better
time if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny human
brains smooth and Tiny and dumb as they
are but if you'd like to be better than
that all you need is a cup or micro
glass a tanker gels a sign a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope me the end
of the day the thing that makes every
everything better today with a little
bit of oxytocin thrown in for
free join me now for the unparallel
pleasure
sip I feel like I totally Joe B in that
simultaneous
sip I'd like to read the simultaneous
sip in the character of Joe
Biden uh
uh mug my phone and
uh Tiger Tiger Trump's making my candy
too
small I think that's how it
sounds anyway if you were watching uh
the Dilbert comic you would see uh an
interesting
thing if you subscribe to the dilber
comic either on X or on
locals um you also get the digital d
calendar there's only a digital one this
year and you would see the 10 years from
current date so I'm running the calendar
or 10 years ago
Comics the comic from 10 years ago this
week could have been written today uh 10
years ago I was writing about the robots
taking over you know Dilbert's job and
using their advanced
intelligence and uh it it would look
like it was written today it would look
exactly like today it was weird all
right in the category of science you
could have totally skipped and just
asked Scott and saved a lot of money
Scott we're considering doing this uh
large double blind
experiment um but uh before we spend
millions of dollars and years doing it
maybe we should just ask you and save
all that money see here's one of those
ones where they could have done that
they did a study and they found that
that
uh the internet Alters brain chemistry
in young people and might make them
addicted yeah yeah uh it's 2024 and
we're just discovering that the
internet's kind of
addictive I feel like you could have
saved a lot of money on this
one do you know how I knew the internet
is addictive and video games are
addictive and that kind of stuff I've
seen a minor playing a video game have
you ever seen a young boy playing a
video
game what's it look like to
you what the hell does it look like to
you if that's not addiction I don't know
what is for God's sakes yeah that's a
little
obvious here's another one you could
have asked me
about um scientists at M MIT are
building this AI chatbot that will be a
version of you that they will
artificially age into the future so that
you can actually have a conversation
with yourself in the future like your
self- retired and you could say things
like all right um so you were a teacher
for 30 years let's say that's what you
want it to become how' it work out and
then the the chat bot will say stuff
like well you know very rewarding you
maybe tell you it didn't make as much
money as he could have but you know the
benefits are good that sort of thing
well the reason you could have asked me
is because this this science was done
maybe 20 years ago I remember talking
about it 20 years ago if they
artificially this is before AI but they
artificially use CGI I think to Aid you
and all you had to do is look at
yourself as an old person and then they
would ask you how much you're saving in
your retirement
accounts and the people who saw a photo
of themselves old saved more money
because now their future old self looked
like a real person they had a visual
representation so yes I believe that
talking to your future self as your
adviser might be the very best way to
improve your life in the future it's not
there yet but imagine if you got advice
from
you the the the more mature version of
yourself who are you going to trust more
than
you that has more experience than you
the only thing that would be better than
me is me with a little more
experience that says every person in the
world all right um so that's exciting
actually that could be a pretty big deal
so Senator Joanie Ernst I think she's
the one I didn't write it down by by
memory I think she's the one who was
caught on the hot mic give me a fact
check if I got the wrong Senator but as
she was walking away and her microphone
is still on she mumbled I don't trust
anyone who's un was eaten by
cannibals
now that's a good
joke I I immediately said wait I'm GNA
have to look into this Joanie Ernst
because suddenly she's a little smarter
than I thought it's it's actually hard
to tell a funny
joke you know one that you haven't heard
before that's not just being copied but
what makes this work I'll talk about it
in terms of what makes the joke work I
don't trust anyone whose uncle was eaten
by
cannibals you get that it doesn't make
sense right like it's not a logical
statement but that's why it's funny it's
funny because your brain tries to make
it make sense make it make sense what is
his uncle have to do with
him
but I suppose you could say that anybody
who claims that Uncle was eating by
cannibals would be a you know stronger
way to play it but it's a funnier joke
if you just say I don't trose any when
he was Uncle was eaten by cannibals that
the fact that it's just got that little
bit of illogic there's nothing that
connects the uncle to
Biden is what makes it funny because
your brain tries to make it make sense
and it doesn't and that's that's the
model for for a joke now could I teach
this to
AI I could but I still couldn't do
it because it would have to run through
lots of examples and judge them and they
can't judge them now the first time I
heard this or let's say I thought this
joke in my own head it would have made
me laugh as soon as I thought of
it
and um and then I would have known it
was a funny joke but AI can't do that
because it can't test it on its own
Brain before it tries it
out all right I'm going to give you an
NPC
tests do you ever wonder if we're a
simulation if you're an NPC anybody ever
wonder
that well I'm going to find out right
now I'm going to read you a story this
is really in the news it's a real story
and then I will test your reactions and
we'll spot some NPCs I did this also on
X it's a good experiment watch it all
right here's the story there's a company
called climb Works who uh has found a
way to uh vastly reduce the cost of
sucking CO2 directly out of the air
company was called yeah climb Works
they've they've already done this
they've sucked CO2 out of the
air come on there we go NPCs are
weighing in we caught a
few yeah so they're taking this CO2 out
of the air much more efficiently than
they used
to you I think some of you are cheating
you saw the answer in my uh in my X Post
Yeah if you if you said trees or or CO2
is plant food you're an
NPC do you know
why because it's the most obvious thing
to say in that situation that's that's
the
tell and I've been I've been talking
about this topic for years and every
time I do somebody says oh you're
telling me they invented trees
feeling pretty good about that one they
invented trees is what you're
saying or they say Scott if they take
all the uh CO2 out of the air don't you
know that's plant food it's plant
food now I'm not saying you're
wrong I'm just saying it's the most
obvious thing to say so if you can't
avoid saying the most obvious thing you
might be an NPC that's all that's all
I'm saying so if you're not an
NPC but yet you fell into the Trap of
saying the most obvious
thing don't do that anymore because it
makes you look like an NPC all right I'm
going to test you again I'm going to
test you
again somebody should invent a
food that is an indistinct food that
just has all of your vitamins and
minerals and you could just eat it every
day
you didn't have to worry about it being
you know all uh nutritionally Complete
because it would be all
good say
it say it I know there's an NPC
here say soil and green say it yeah that
that's an NPC trap if you talk about a
new food source and somebody says it's
soil and grain
NPC if you talk about um a good way to
exercise and then somebody in the
comments says swiming is the best form
of exercise that's an NPC because it's
the most obvious thing to say about
every conversation about
exercise if you're talking about uh diet
and
fitness and your contribution is if you
exercise more and eat fewer calories
you'll lose
weight well you're either Matt Walsh or
you're an NPC Matt Walsh is doing it for
entertainment so that's a different
situation he's making content out of
it all right um here's some news that I
was worried about this for a while and
it's I find this reassuring you ever
ever see a news story where you've been
kind of anxious about this but then you
finally find out the truth and it's just
what you hoped it would be and then you
can finally relax well here's the truth
and and thank God uh V continues to be a
National Treasure um because he's over
in he traveled to Italy and he met with
the
Pope
and VI confirms that the pope hold on
because you're going to feel good about
this the pope is opposed to
war he thinks Ukraine should be settled
peacefully I don't know about you people
but that could have gone either
way and
I'm for one am glad that the pope is
opposed to war because you never know I
mean unless you check in with him once
in a
while how much trouble would it be if
suddenly they thought you know what the
more I think about this the more I'm
liking
War so I guess we got another reprieve
this Pope this Pope is the good kind
opposed to war and thank you V for going
over there and confirming that for us
because up until now we were just
guessing well nothing entertains me more
than watching the washingt post die from
eating its own dog food and what I mean
by that is this somebody named Margaret
Sullivan who I think is maybe a Democrat
of some kind uh maybe a writer I'm not
sure uh she said talking about the
Washington Post she said Each of our
three newsrooms oh I guess she writes
for the Washington Post each of our new
three newsrooms will will be led by an
outstanding white male which we feel is
especially appropriate in Washington DC
Zing if these three newsrooms are
successful we will consider a fourth and
a
fifth so how about my Dei and sarcasm
and I'll put them
together and uh here's what I say about
that this is the kind of
writing that made the Washington Post
lose $77 million just last
year yeah this is one of their best
writers see the problem
[Laughter]
yet so there so because they've accepted
the you know the
Dei philosophy at least the
employees uh they insist that they want
more
Dei but management and ownership appears
to have decided something opposite
as in we can't lose $77 million a year
and nobody's reading your stuff so maybe
we'll bring in some people who are very
experienced but uh-oh the experienced
people were white and the boss the new
boss said
directly that you know well I'm I'm
going to I'll paraphrase this so this is
not his words at all but he basically
said I don't have time to dick around so
I just brought people I know can do the
work
I mean again that's not his words but
that's what it was he said basically I
just don't have time to dick around so I
got some people that I've worked with
before that I know can do
this now is that smart very smart in
fact I can't even think of a smarter
thing what would be smarter than
recruiting great people with a great
track
record well the problem is that works
everywhere except where there's a lot of
Dei so watching the Dei rip the culture
apart after the entities such as the
news have been ho trying to push Dei on
us I like watching it destroy their
entire
organization because that's what's
happening uh there's an FDA advisory
panel that uh turned down an application
for a specific psychedelic for a
specific company that they were going to
do lyos Therapeutics they warant use a
an MDMA like
substance um well actually MDMA and they
had some kind of a therapeutic uh
process that would go with that and they
applied and the FDA said uh no a 10 said
nope the risks outweigh the
benefits now what's the first thing you
think when you hear that an FDA advisory
panel now the FDA itself hasn't voted
these are just the advisory panel we
expect it would go the same as the
advisory panel because it was you know 8
to2
but um what's the first thing you think
when you see the FDA might turn down a
MDA based MDMA based therapy do you say
to yourself well here's some honest
people who looked at the data and
decided to protect us by keeping us away
from this kind of a risk is that what
you think is that your first thought or
is your first thought the some number of
these advisory panel people they have to
be experts in the field right what would
be the point of an advisory panel unless
they were experts in this kind of
stuff now what would you expect of an
expert of this kind of stuff well one
thing I'd expect is if they ever wanted
to make big money they have to work for
a big pharmaceutical company do you
think that there are too many big
Pharmaceutical companies who are super
interested in seeing psychedelics
destroy the biggest Cash Cow they've
ever had which is anxiety and
anti-depressant
drugs so I asked myself is there really
any possibility that the
FDA is even structured in a way that
they could possibly approve something
that's insanely good for uh the country
and you might not even need a
professional to help you with it now
ideally you wouldn't want to do any
psychedelics without you know some kind
of professional guidance and you know
quality control and all that but people
will I mean in the real world they'll
take some mushrooms and see see what
happens so I've got a feeling that the
FDA as structured is not the entity we
should ever trust for something that
would reduce our costs by
100% basically cost of treatment and and
also would fix you almost immediately
according to many many
reports so I don't know I'd love to
think the advisers got it right but we
live in such a zero trust environment
that I just automatically assume they
didn't get it right do you have the same
reaction I my working assumption is it's
is it's crooked do you have the same I
have no evidence it's just a working
assumption uh well meanwhile the EU
commission they're looking at uh
expanding their surveillance of their
population into digital devices so they
would uh maybe authorize the government
to listen into your digital
devices I I assume we're already there
is there anybody who thinks their
digital devices are not listening to
them you know you know the people who uh
don't want to have a let's say an Amazon
or a Google or an apple digital device
is because they're afraid it will listen
to them in their private time how many
of those people also have a smartphone
sitting on a table next to them at the
whole time they're saying H sure sure
wouldn't want to talk into that digital
device over there while you've got your
smartphone in your
hand if the government wants to hear
your stuff can't they get into your
phone just as easily as they can get
into your digital device
you're I I feel like it's only a
question of whether they want to they
want to get your stuff if they want to
get all your Communications and also
listen into what you're doing at the
moment I think they can do that to
everybody all the time I don't think
having a digital device would make
really any difference at all because
when are you away from your
phone how often do you spend near a
digital
device but not your phone not very
much anyway uh the xplatform Elon mus
xplatform
is maybe going to do some uh video
product that's kind of like Tik Tok and
Instagram reals and there's a TV app
coming too so sure enough the xplatform
is going to be the everything platform
and musk would be crazy if he didn't do
reals and Tik Tok things because you
know American Tik Tok might go away or
it might get divested and be with a comp
competitor to X um yeah all the existing
companies should be trying to chip away
if that Tik Tock
business could be big I heard also that
maybe there's a rule change on X that
would allow more adult content so long
as children were couldn't see
it and that I feel like that might be
related to the
reals because you know the reals have
this way even if you have rules against
what kind of content can be there they
they have all kinds of ways to beat it
have you seen on in on Instagram for
example you're not allowed to do full
nudity but if You' seen the the
workarounds to the full
nudity they they do skimpy wet
T-shirts that I suppose technically
would show you clothes but you know
leaving nothing to the imagination the
other thing they do is they flash you so
that you have to try to catch it on a
screenshot so it'll be some Instagram
influencer just you know lifts up
top I guess the algorithm can't catch it
so everybody's always looking to
cheat so it does seem to me if musk is
going to go big on video you know these
short video Loops it's going to attract
that kind of
business and you might as well you might
as well adjust your rules because you're
not going to stop it so that's the way I
do
it there's a uh investor called VOD
kosla
Who I Really worry about him because he
says stuff that just sounds like he's
crazy I mean he's presenting himself
like I don't know like he's stupid but
that couldn't be the case so I wonder if
there's something else going on but he
was on CNBC and just called the he
called the podcasters of the Allin pod
Mega
extremists how could he possibly even be
familiar with the podcast or those
personalities you you know the Allin
podcast David Sachs and chamoth and a
couple other buddies whose name I keep
forgetting sorry about
that I all remember the two
anyway the the Allin pod are people who
I imagine might have voted Democrat in a
normal time I don't know what their
affiliations are but they they present
themselves as simply
factual um Patriots basically dads so so
that they have a dad Vibe a patriot Vibe
and just a practical Vibe like what
makes sense what doesn't make sense with
empy without all the the
BS and if you just simply try to call
balls and Strikes and just call things
way you see them like hey the Border
seems a little bit too open I mean
nothing nothing weird just the most
ordinary observations but the all-in Pod
can you know let you see things through
different windows and you
more interesting
takes but does he really think they're
Maga extremists or is there just
something wrong with this guy I don't
know and what's interesting about it is
that it's it's counter to the trend
which we'll talk about in a
minute there are yet again a few more
Biden brain malfunction videos where he
tries to talk in public and things don't
go well I don't need to get the details
uh just be aware that he's failing fast
have you seen a video recently of let's
say his debate performance in
2020 have you ever seen that watch
Biden's debate in 2020 he is not the
same
person yeah in 2020 I was saying he's
too old and we can't take a risk on this
but if you see him by today's standard
he he looked positively young and
vibrant just at the beginning of his
term he has lost so much
and indeed The Wall Street Journal is
reporting that both Democrats and
Republicans are saying privately that
when they meet with him and they're in
the same room and they're meeting
privately you're hearing stories like
this uh and this is back in January I I
believe he's failed obviously even since
January would you agree I think the last
five months you can see the decline it's
obvious um but even in January people
said he's SPO spoke so softly at times
that people struggled to hear him and uh
he would read notes even from the most
obvious points meaning that he couldn't
handle even the most obvious thing you
say about a topic and that he would
pause for extended periods and sometimes
closed his eyes for so long that
sometimes they didn't know if he was
even paying attention to the meeting
anymore uh so those are reports from
multiple people who have been in the
room with him recently uh but counter to
that we have Morning
Joe who uh is here to tell us that uh
not only is Joe Biden sh sharp You know
despite everything you see with your own
eyes behind closed doors he's the
sharpest smartest guy on internet oh my
God compared to somebody like you know
McCarthy or any of these other people oh
my God can I I I can't even tell you how
smart Joe Biden is how how on top of it
he is how his brain is like just a
perfect machine right
now can you believe that morning Joe
actually
embarrassingly is pushing the most
obviously not true thing as if it's true
and I watched M she has what I call a m
face it looks like wife
face when your husband is saying some
 that you're not quite buying into
yourself do you think that Ma is fully
on board with the Biden looks fine to me
I don't think so look at her face the
whole time her husband is talking she
she's got like
a like like a weird little smile like
yeah I know what you're saying and you
know I kind of like the direction of it
but I think everybody knows you're full
of so maybe you could tone that
down and embarrass me less on TV
that's what it feels like to me well
here's the funnest part on MSNBC Michael
steel uh well-known prominent Democrat
kind of a guy calls out the fact that
billionaires are starting to make Trump
look acceptable to other
people oh here it comes even the
Democrats have noticed that the
billionaire class is starting to make
Trump look acceptable and normal to
people H which billionaires are we
talking about well the bill amman's the
Elon musks we're talking about the all
in pod we're talking about um one of the
guys at
Blackstone uh I think even Jamie Diamond
not too long ago said hey you know keep
an open mind right so he wasn't
anti-trump
either so here's what I think I think
the billionaires are the ones who go
first do you know why because they don't
have
bosses the people without bosses are the
only ones who can tell the truth in
public if they're also
Rich you get that it's not a coincidence
that the billionaire class is rising in
terms of its persuasion power it has to
because there's nobody else who can do
it and you know either um I I feel and I
see it and you can almost just it's just
it's
palpable the incentive for the the
so-called billionaires that I mentioned
their incentive seems to be the
Spider-Man curse as far as I can tell
they do not seem to be driven by
partisan politics they don't seem to be
driven just by profit you know they're
not advocating for things necessarily
that are you know just good for them and
stuff like
that the Spider-Man curse if you don't
know what that is um from Spider-Man
with great responsib with great power
comes great
responsibility imagine you're a
billionaire you're watching the country
dissolve and you know it's because
people can't tell the
truth that Biden's a a train wreck and
it's just got to be
fixed what would you do just ask
yourself what would you do if you didn't
have to fear anything because you don't
have a boss and you're already a
billionaire and what what could go wrong
you would feel a responsibility to get
involved if you'd never been involved in
politics before because you're the only
ones who can fix it nobody's on nobody's
coming to help nobody's coming to help
it is just is just uh the billionaires
got to step up and we're watching it
happen so that is a gigantic gigantic
change and it's scary enough that even
the Democrats are noticing it and
not only are billionaires smart but
people look up to them because they want
to be like them you know especially if
you build something of
value but this brings me to a comment
that
um I saw talker Carlson make he was on
uh somebody's podcast and I'm going to
talk about him a little bit more but he
had this interesting
theory that um what we see as evil you
know all the destructive things going on
that we just just sort of collectively
think are some form of evil he he says
is really people who don't know how to
make anything have an Impulse to destroy
the things made by people who do know
how to make
things oh my God is that on point that
actually might be the best description
of everything we're seeing Marxism
antifa everything and and I've told you
this story I think
before the first time I discovered this
thing where people will destroy anything
that looks like good work from other
people is when I developed the Dilbert
comic when I was still working at my
Corporation at the phone company so I
had this whiteboard in my cubicle and
every day for a while there before I
before I was published I would draw a
little comic of this character that came
to be Dilbert and it became popular
around the office and people would like
it and here's the thing if you can do
something like that that's sort of show
offy it it kind of demonstrates you have
some kind of genetic quality that
somebody might want to mate with now it
would be the same if I had giant muscles
or if I were tall and had good hair or
if I were a good musician you know any
kind of talent so if you display Talent
what it does is it it brings up in
people the need to destroy you if they
don't have talent other people with
Talent will look at you and say hey
that's pretty good because they're not
afraid they have talent people who don't
have talent will find a way to destroy
it or find something else wrong with you
that means you should not nobody should
pay attention to you here's how I
discovered it when I would draw Dilbert
on my
whiteboard men would come into my office
who are not exactly killing it in life
you know just your ordinary cubicle men
and they would find a reason to destroy
the comic on my whiteboard
and it was the damnest thing and women
didn't do it women didn't do it ever but
I'll tell you how they'd do it they'd
walk in and they would lean on
it they would just lean on it and and
they they would erase it with the back
of their shirt or they they'd be making
a point and they pick up they pick up a
magic marker and they would start
drawing right over they would start
drawing whatever their point was like
directly over my drawing
or they would pick up the the the Eraser
and erase my whiteboard in my office of
a of a drawing that I made and then just
start doing whatever they were going to
tell me and I'm thinking to myself
there's something destructive about this
that is so obvious and it was so
consistent like I as soon as I saw a guy
walk into my office I'd say all right
how long is it going to take and I would
just watch how long it took him to
accidentally destroy my a work
it was it was
weird so I've been watching that all my
life that phenomenon obviously when
Dilbert became
successful um oh and by the way it's a
it's a running joke on X when people
come at me hard you pie of crap BL I'll
check their their
profile quite often they're people
trying to be writers and failing more
often than not or they're trying to be
cartoonist and failing so they're all in
some kind of failed art thing so they
when they see that I've succeeded they
just have to tear me down it's a natural
impulse and I think that might actually
be explaining almost everything we see
you know we used to call it uh income
inequality and we used to say Hey you
know if we don't fix the income
inequality the people who don't have are
going to come after the people who have
and you got a civil unrest so you know
you better fix it but I think what it
turned into is just
destruction where people are tearing
down your city you build because they
can't build it they want to you know
tear down Elon Musk because they can't
build it I mean look at the fact that
Elon Musk builds you know Tesla and then
some Delaware bunch of punks who
couldn't succeed at anything decided to
take away his paycheck of $53
billion why did they do that do you
think they did that because that seemed
like the right thing to do no I mean it
might have been purely political but I
think if you see it under Tucker's
filter it actually looks clear they just
didn't like the fact that there was a
male who had you know 11 children and
could impregnate anybody wants
basically uh and that he was just
killing it in life and they had to just
attack him because they couldn't handle
the stress of you know being less than
him by so
much so look for that effect it's
everywhere uh it's fake poll season
Newsweek has some fake polls where Joe
Joe Biden is suddenly leading Donald
Trump in multiple Battleground States oh
yeah I'm sure that really
happened I'm sorry and if you read all
the way to the end of the article it
would be like well they started the poll
on online and then they I said wait what
they started it
online and then some of it's not
online what good is an online
poll why in the world would you report
an online poll without saying okay this
is not scientific but we need an online
poll now I don't mind that because at
least you know what you're getting but
you have to go all the way to the end to
find out it's not even a little bit
credible and I I I think I read the
entire article without seeing who did
the
poll I think it might have been there
but it do nor normally a story about
polling they put the polling entity in
the first
paragraph right you you've all seen
stories about poll results it's the
first
paragraph you you I'm not even sure it
was in the story in this case so it's
exactly what it looks like it's a it's
it's fake pole time and the fakest of
the fake news will be the ones that are
reporting them so Newsweek you should
just assume is a publication
and just a Democrat organ at this
point all right rasmuson had a poll that
uh 63% of Democrats believe the judge
should sentenced Trump to prison I don't
know the these kinds of polls are just
people going to line up on political
grounds
uh yeah I I don't know what to make much
of this everybody thinks the other side
should go to
jail all right could have asked me
um I'm seeing some smart people say that
the prosecution of Hunter for the gun
charges might not be what we think it is
on the surface it looks like oh Justice
is blind and even a president's son can
be you know charged and go to jail for
crimes because that's how good our
system is it's a fair
system but he's being tried in Delaware
where we're expecting a hung jury of
people who just like him um maybe the
judge is fake you know maybe jury
nullification so you're basically seeing
situation which might be a completely
fake trial to show the country that well
you know there's no laware against
Trump because look even Hunter Biden's
being you know being handled by the law
so so it must be fair because it's
happening to Hunter happened to Trump I
mean that's as Fair as you can get
right
well as others have pointed out the gun
charge is the one most the most
disconnected from from his father and
the one that doesn't get you to anywhere
near any discovery about anything the
hunter did with barismo or
Ukraine is that a
coincidence the only one we're seeing is
the only one that has nothing to do with
politics it's the only one that makes a
hunter look a little
sympathetic because Republicans and
people like me say you know
what we do like people to have some
flexibility about owning
guns you know I until a crime has been
committed that's you know a different
situation um and although he did seem to
be Reckless with his gun so this you
know I I can't say it's the wrong
decision in this particular case but
they did it's probably not a coincidence
that he's being tried for the only thing
that would divert you from Joe Biden the
only thing that would give you maybe
some sympathy for Hunter because it's
really about his addiction and I I do
have sympathy for that
and and at the same time he might have
no chance of getting
convicted so it's everything it's
everything for Democrats they can
pretend that the law
matters they can get him off and say
well I guess it was nothing there and
then they can say and obviously the
lawfare against Trump is real because
look the the law is operating wherever
there's a
crime so it looks like it's
 uh Facebook
sleta is uh rumored to be thinking about
testing Unstoppable ads where you can't
skip
them oh my God why don't they just tape
my eyeballs open and feed me ads anyway
um in the hill publication the hill uh
Democrats are saying that Biden needs to
appear more in touch with voters needs
especially
inflation well I thought their plan was
to say uh Trump was the cause of the
inflation
and I would like to introduce the theme
for today which is everything the uh
Democrats are doing is
imaginary it's all
imaginary so Biden's going to pretend to
address inflation and he's going to
pretend it was Trump's
fault that's
imaginary but on the border since the
Border was his weakest uh political
issue Biden's issuing some executive
order that looks like it's completely a
hoax meaning that it will stop a few
people but it won't come anywhere near
you know ending the crisis at the border
but he'll sell it like he did he's going
to sell it like well it's as far as we
can go without those Republicans being
useful to
us so I won't give you the details you
see the details on the other news but um
it it's supposed to put a limit on the
Asylum Seekers but there are so many
other holes that it leaves open
it's not even clear you'll know the
difference really so he's got a fake
case about inflation he's got a fake
executive order about the uh
border and uh well but he's also got a
fake Gaza peace plan which he keeps
claiming uh Israel is behind and Israel
says well not
really so he's trying to make it look as
though he's got some peace coming um but
uh that appears to be fake and just for
politics so he's got a fake economic
idea about inflation a fake border idea
and a fake Gaza peace
plan meanwhile Jake Sullivan was meeting
with the families of American hostages
and he told them that if uh the
president's peace plan which is fake
gets adopted then maybe that would help
uh free their families um the hostages
who were Americans
now this is another example of Democrats
failing to understand human motivation
in every
domain what happens if you negotiate
with the people who have your your
hostages everybody knows that it makes
them do more of it if you want to have
more hostages give them something before
they give the hostages back let me tell
you how you should deal with the
hostages the America should give Hamas a
Target list things that are going to
disappear in the order that they will
disappear until all of our hostages are
back and then after they're back we'll
maybe try to help them with a peace plan
but until then Israel can do whatever
the they want let me put it this
way as long as Hamas has one American
hostage and We Know It Israel can
Slaughter the whole bunch of
them because you what are you going to
do they're basically killing their own
people at this point because if if
they're going to make their own citizens
hostages and our citizens unfortunately
the only way you can prevent this
happening in the in the future is to do
things that nobody with good conscience
would want to do but fortunately we have
people who are willing to do hard things
and they're very willing to do it so I
think we should just say to Hamas here's
the deal here's all the stuff that's
going to disappear
and and then of course they're going to
call the bluff and then you say all
right we just gave some uh mother of all
bombs to uh Israel and they're going to
drop them on this neighborhood so you
better get out of that neighborhood and
you just make the whole neighborhood
disappear ideally after people get
out but unless unless you go
Savage they're just going to keep taking
Americans so and by the way you know who
knows if we can really ever get them
back they may already be dead but yeah
this is the worst idea ever so imaginary
peace deals
wow so when do we notice that everything
that Biden has done is imaginary so he
ran for office on the fine people hoax
and the drinking bleach hoax Hillary
Clinton ran on the Russia collusion
hoax uh now he's got a fake border plan
a fake Gaza plan plan to blame Trump for
inflation he's got a fake war in ukra
Ukraine fake in the sense that they're
not telling us the real reason we're in
Ukraine am I right we're there for
energy we're a pirate ship we're a
pirate ship trying to take the booty
from another pirate ship but he's
telling us we're fighting for I don't
know my democracy or something yeah it's
all
fake then you've got the law fair
against Trump that's all fake you've got
the poll showing Biden pulling ahead
that's all fake you've got the Morning
Joe and the MS MSNBC crowd still
protecting the Democrats all with fake
news um and now they want here's the
things they want us to believe by the
way did you know that dementia causes
paranoia
dementia is well known to cause paranoia
and confusion and memory
problems um let me tell you some of the
things that Biden is saying about Trump
and you tell me if this sounds like uh a
person in their right mind or does it
sound like somebody with dementia fueled
paranoia Trump's going to steal your
democracy this could be the last
election ever Trump has dictator
Tendencies Trump destroyed our Norms
Trump brings chaos Trump snapped when he
lost the election Trump is a felonious
insurrectionist Trump will be worse than
last time Trump thinks he's Above the
Law do you see the
pattern every thing that that Joe
Biden is promoting is
fake now let's compare it to the other
side do do Republicans sometimes promise
things they don't deliver
sure but even if you take something like
uh you know Trump promising the wall and
not quite
delivering he sure tried like hell there
was nothing fake about that he tried
like
hell do you blame him for saying Mexico
will pay for the wall well not really we
all knew that was just for fun right
he's not really trying to sell that
but so you've got so you've got
Republicans who are suggesting specific
real world things and you've got
Democrats who have nothing to run on
because their whole world is falling
apart they've destroyed everything that
we care about and we know it because
we're watching it in real time so the
only thing they have is dementia fuel
paranoia that they're trying to get you
to buy into all right we got this
dementia fueled paranoid guy and he's
going to complain about his candy
getting too small so maybe you should
change your vote because Mr small candy
said
so I'm getting tired of being the only
one pointing out that the entire
Democratic platform for years has been
nothing but
 we can't say that we can't make
that the whole story that nothing they
do is real everything is an OP
everything they do is a op it's
Ora hoax which is like an
OP anyway here's some other things tuer
Carlson said that were just so fun he
said he met CLA Schwab himself and he
doesn't really fear the wef because CLA
Schwab is just an idiot and most of the
people in power are idiots too so I
don't think you have to worry about the
all powerful world World economic Forum
it's just idiots having a party now Elon
Musk has a view not too far from that
that it's basically a club for rich
people and don't worry about it too much
and I I buy into
that I don't think the world economic
forum is why we're fighting in Ukraine
do
you do you do you think that's what they
would have
picked I don't think
so
so um Tucker also believes that uh human
beings are mating with non-human beings
there's some kind of entities that walk
the earth looking like people and have
always been here you know throughout
time and every culture seems to talk
about
them okay
um and and he does believe the literal
truth of uh his religion and the
Bible so
and he thinks that the government knows
this and won't tell
us now I haven't seen too many things
that seem less believable to me than
that but it's so interesting that it's
coming from
Tucker because so much of what he says
is so right on point as as I mentioned
earlier but there's something about
Tucker that makes him different from
other people I I also think he's got he
was talking to somebody who believes
that the uh the secret Sonic Ray is real
um so he he has a lot of people who have
claims of UFOs and aliens and stuff like
that and my take on Tucker because he
said it directly he said it directly he
kind of likes to believe in some of the
Fantastic stuff but where you don't see
it is in
politics meaning that he seems to have
some really good way of separating the
real world the politics because he he
talks about it in the in the most real
world way you ever talk about anything
but when he talks about his religious
beliefs or his belief about
reality he seems to have a life style
preference for believing let's say
Fantastical things because they're fun
you know his religion gives him
benefits so don't argue with him about
his religion it works it totally works I
mean you can even observe it from a
distance that his choice of religion
works for him it looks like it works to
me um even if it's not your religion it
looks like it works for him so I think I
think terer has to be seen as a
lifestyle
believer uh let me give you an
example I don't necessarily think if you
put a gun to my head I wouldn't
necessarily say the aliens built the
pyramids but I really like thinking it
it's a lifestyle belief so I can't say a
believe Bel you know like if you're
going to you know Murder my dog if I get
the wrong answer I might go all right
it's not aliens after all but you know
it's e it's easy to
adopt
non you know beliefs that don't matter
because they don't affect your life if
they're
fun so that's my best guess is he has
fun beliefs that don't have any impact
on your life they're just fun and then
the real world he seems really careful
about sticking to what's real when he
talks about the real
world
anyway um let's take a look at uh talker
Carlson's theory that uh people who
can't build things will destroy the
things built by other
people are there any examples of
that um how about Steve jobs Steve Jobs
was a builder he built
things uh his wife his
widow um seems to be active in politics
and the side of politics that is
destroying everything it would it be
true that Steve Jobs built and his widow
is destroying what at least what good
there is in the country so she's the uh
what did she buy um the Atlantic she
owns the Atlantic right which is just a
propaganda outfit what about Jeff Bezos
Jeff Bezos built a gigantic you know
most successful company and then he gets
divorced and what's his wife do she
donates to all the organizations that
are
destructive now she doesn't think of it
that way I'm sure but you can see it so
it seems to me that um you've got Elon
Musk will build a company but idiots in
Delaware will try to take his money away
Bezos brings a company builds a company
and his ex-wife takes half his money and
uses it to destroy the country jobs
builds the greatest company his wife
uses money to destroy things now if you
asked them they wouldn't say they're
destroying anything which and I believe
that they would believe it it's just
that the impulse to destroy what better
people built is so strong so strong I
can tell you that uh in my journey from
having no money
to being well off uh when I had no money
I would have destroyed
things the the idea of putting um
graffiti on somebody else's asset
somebody Rich was actually attractive to
me at one point in my life do you know
why because I was a jealous little
who had
nothing I felt it I'm not speculating
what it feels like to have nothing and
being surrounded by people who have L I
absolutely felt a destructive impulse
toward their
success when I became successful you
know this is the old story you you
become more conservative if you become
successful because you don't want
anybody to take it away from
you I became uh much more alarmed to see
assets destroyed now when I see graffiti
on somebody's nice expensive building I
don't say well you had to come and you
know clean it up yourself you got plenty
of money now I think what the hell are
you doing destroying somebody's
beautiful thing they built right and I
think that has a lot to do with the
animosity toward Trump trump is not only
somebody who apparently buildt things
you know big beautiful buildings but he
also
brags if you add the bragging to the
success you trigger people to want to
destroy you because they're not
successful and that's what we see the
least successful people want to destroy
them what are the billionaires
want the billionaires are just looking
at it and saying okay who can be a
better president they might
disagree but they're not trying to
destroy other billionaires because they
have their own
stuff all right um New York Times is
reporting that uh the GOP is looking for
revenge and indeed on social media and
other places we do see people you know
talking about putting lists together of
Democrats who should be investigated and
tried should Trump come to
office and at the um I'm not sure that's
the best impulse my advice to you would
be to cool it on the Revenge stuff
because first of all you shouldn't call
it Revenge because it's hard to back
that um but I know what it is I mean to
me it's more a mutually assured
destruction meaning you have to
establish a precedent that if the other
team is going to go to that level of
Badness you're going to match it and
they're not going to like it so there is
something to be said for you know
creating a disincentive to do more of it
I wouldn't call it Revenge though it's
more like creating a
disincentive and it's more like finding
out what's true just looking for the
truth so
um also America First legal I think I
believe that's Steven Miller's entity he
created is suing the Department of
Justice for records related to key
figures in the uh New York case versus
Trump to find out what they did to
coordinate with the White House
so uh apparently they asked for but did
not get records uh under the Foya they
wanted to get records about Matthew
colan
Colangelo because he was a key figure in
the Biden Administration but he left
that to go work on the lawfare against
Trump and it's a completely good
question which is uh H maybe we should
know what conversations happened because
this looks like a political prosecution
in every way it looks like it and
so America First legals going to say
well let's find out let let's look at
your documents let us find out if this
was political because it looks like it
so America First legal is the only thing
that looks like the Republic to
me we don't see the Press doing what the
Press is supposed to do we don't see the
politicians do what the politicians we'd
want them to do anyway but America First
legal is doing everything I want them to
do that's everything I want to see
happen I want to see the bad guys get
pushed I want to make sure that the law
laware on the left is matched with some
law fair on the right for disincentive
purposes you know not for Revenge I
don't really have a a feeling about
revenge but I would certainly like to
have a mutually assured destruction in
case either side gets out of
hand all right now the big
payoff this is the part that if you were
nice enough to last this
long I'm going to tell you something
provocative you know that for a long
time I've been trying to figure out the
mystery that is George
Soros CU people said to me Scott he's
behind the funding of all these things
that are
bad I'm dismissing truths that scare me
the trolls are here trolls which which
truths am I
dismissing I just want to see if they
have a
specific what what am I uh dismissing
anybody it's called Justice I don't care
what you call it do you do you have
anything to actually
say or are you just being trolls
today all right it looks like they have
nothing to actually to
say all right so here's my provocative
hypothesis uh about why George Soros is
doing what he did so apparently back in
the early 90s when he started drawing up
his plans for his open
Society um he had some lofty goals which
I have to admit sound pretty darn good
on paper now I haven't looked into them
but my understanding would is it would
be things like wouldn't be great if
people could immigrate to where the work
is right it wouldn't be great if people
could improve their lives by being able
to move from a bad place to a good place
now that sounds pretty damn good on
paper because you assume you know it's
just obvious that you wouldn't do
uncontrolled
immigration but wouldn't it be great if
you could get a work permit you know
some kind of an easier process so you
know everybody's economy would be better
now the economics of that and the logic
of that are actually really strong
because every time that you give people
more
freedom uh they can make more money it
seems pretty much one to one more
freedom more money more freedom more
money you know as long as you've got
crime under control right Freedom within
you know the legal structure not freedom
to do crime so on paper that makes a lot
of sense to me you know with my
economics background I go you know what
it does make sense that if you increase
people's Mobility across borders that
probably everybody would do well as long
as you managed it right
now like everything in the world if you
do a wrong well it's a disaster right
now apparently there's also something
about the justice
system and how it was unfair to Black
Americans and minorities in general now
that's true and suppose that they said
our solution is to vastly increase the
diversity in the justice system and then
we wouldn't worry so much that it's you
know uh White racism that's causing
these you know what seems to be
imbalances and sentencing and other
things now on paper I love
that I I don't have a problem with that
at all yes if if minority members of my
country are complaining that they seem
to be in their opinion their lived
experience they're they're
mistreated then it seems to me an
obvious solution to increase the
diversity of Highly qualified candidates
and and just have a better perspective
in the whole legal system and that feels
like an advantage to
me but here's the problem those things
didn't work at
all now we know that but we're seeing
that you know things that are getting
funded are like crazy things like black
lives matter and antifa and open borders
and so there's this huge
disconnect between what sounded pretty
rational to me in the 990s but now we've
tried it we we know what works and what
doesn't why would you still do it like
why wouldn't you say wow that didn't
work or or we still like these things
but we're going to have to put much
better guard rails on them why wouldn't
you do something like
that now the the theories I've heard
just don't make any sense to me right
Elon Musk one of the smartest people
around says that uh he thinks that
George Soros just hates
Humanity I don't think there's a chance
that's true I really don't I I don't
think there's any chance that's true
he's seen the darkest side of humanity
because he was around during the
Holocaust right he saw it personally so
yeah he's seen the darkest side of
humans but I don't know do you put all
of that effort into this very specific
way of moving things just because you
hate Humanity I mean there must be way
better ways to hate Humanity it's a lot
of work to hate Humanity in that very
specific hard work kind of a way so I
don't believe
that um then there are others who say
well it's it's a Marxist thing you know
all the bad stuff is
Marxist but you can't tell me that the
greatest
capitalist of all time is secretly
funding the Marxist so they can take all
of his money away someday and his family
will be locked up in jail or something
that doesn't make sense so I don't
believe believe that it could be because
George Soros is hates
Humanity I don't believe he's pro-
Marxist that would be crazy and he's not
I mean it would just be crazy um and
then other people said no it's he
destabilizes things so he can make
money right but not the country you're
in not not the main place you've chosen
to live you don't destabilize the
country you're
in that's not how that works I mean if
you did I mean I suppose you could make
money but it's not really the right play
I mean you wouldn't expect like a smart
guy to do
that uh oh here we go I I knew you were
going to hit me with the all capital
Jewish
conspiracy so we've got the all capital
people shouting it's the Jews it's the
Jews Scott why are you ignoring the
obvious it's the Jews
all right so you guys just keep
screaming um you know what it would be
easier it would be easier if you never
came to my live stream
again because I can tell you this
screaming in all caps that's the Jews is
not good
persuasion you just look like a
piece of who doesn't know anything
about anything
honestly so um so I'm not going to deal
with that directly but here is my
hypothesis that ties it all guys are you
ready digging
in number one you've seen that haa
abedine is now uh allegedly dating Alex
Soros just hold that in your mind for a
moment we'll get back to it if you were
a uh FBI profiler and a for
forensic uh let's say money person and
you were trying to figure out like why
money is going from one place to another
but you're going to use FBI uh
stereotyping profiling kind of thing
which I hate to say could be a little
sexist and racist for example let's say
an FBI profiler um finds out that
there's been a a mass
shooter does the profiler say okay I
think it's about even money it's a woman
or a man no no no they don't do that
they go full sexist and they say all
right it's a man and then if it's a
certain kind of mass murder do they say
hm I think uh I think an Asian was
involved in this no they say oh this
kind of looks like a white guy
crime am I right there there're just
some crimes that just scream white
guy so that's what FBI profiling is I
believe where you're looking for these
general you know Tendencies and
statistical things now
if I let me give you uh I'm going to
work at this slowly so I can give you
the big finish in a minute suppose I
told you that there were two
billionaires one was white and one was
black and there were two groups getting
funded one was
Ukraine and one was black lives
matter but you didn't have confirmation
which billionaire was funding Ukraine
and which one was funding black lives
matter now it could go either way we all
agree on that right could be that the
black billionaire cares about Ukraine
could be the white billionaire cares
about black lives matter but if you're
an FBI
profiler and you had to visit one of
them to confirm which way it was you'd
probably you know if you wanted to know
his BLM you'd probably try the black guy
first because people like to fund things
they have some kind of personal
association
with if you see that if you see a
celebrity is uh helping raise money for
a specific
disease sorry for a specific disease do
you say to yourself oh they randomly
picked a specific
disease or do you say no probably they
either had experience with it or a
family member because these are the kind
of Tendencies you
see so look at George soros's funding
and all the things he's funded from
black lives matters to antifa to uh
lgbtq things to open
borders and then look at George
Soros does it
fit there in the comments somebody's
still yelling in all caps the Jews the
Jews let let me finish my
hypothesis
be which doesn't have anything to do
with that by the way all right all right
here's a here's my hypothesis
is if I were to guess who was the
billionaire who was funding all the
things I I mentioned I wouldn't say a
Hungarian uh octogenarian white
guy it's not impossible you know if he's
just Ultra lefty or whatever but it's
not the first thing you'd think of the
first thing I would think of was that
the funding was coming from a gay black
American who lived in either LA or New
York and was you know had sort of maybe
a Marxist open borders bent would you
agree but that's not George Soros but
wait we have to update George Soros is
not even in charge anymore he's already
turned it over to Alex Soros right now
Alex Soros as we've been told is dating
Uma
abedine and uh how does how does that
make sense
again he's not a gay black
man on either Coast he doesn't seem like
he's a Marxist I mean he seems like he'd
probably be a capitalist how does it
make
sense
well um somebody clued me into his pre
prior
relationships and if you believe all the
photographs on the internet of which
there are
many uh before Uma abedine and I don't
know the timing exactly but it looked
like he was similar age to what he is
now uh he had some kind of a
relationship with a gay black fashion
designer from
LA and if you look at the photos they're
very they're very close or what they
were and if they are I don't know maybe
it's still going on
but the look of it is that he was the
dominant
partner you can't miss it so the the
partner was very large man and Alex
Soros is a smaller man and when you see
them sort of posing for pictures the
larger man is holding the smaller man
almost like a
submissive so imagine if you
would the the Panic that would be if
you're a top Democrat and a normal
person suppose you're Hillary let's call
her normal for now or you're Barack
Obama or just any one of the nor normal
you know carry Democrats and you see
that your biggest problem is that George
Soros keeps funding the craziest people
in the world and you have to explain it
because it's part of your party and you
can't do anything because he also funds
you right so what are you going to
do I'll tell you what I'd
do I would send my agent Huma abedine to
control
Alex Alex Soros I would find a way to
get him out of that relationship with
his
boyfriend and I would make sure that
there was an adult in the room that
reported to Hillary Clinton and the
adults in the Democratic party who was
making sure that he did not do crazy
 now you're saying to yourself Scott
you're talking as if Alexander Soros is
like a or a child or something
that's exactly what I'm saying if you've
heard him talk which is rare because
doesn't give interviews that I've seen
but I did see him talking at some event
and he seemed to be a as in really
a not like the usual kind where we
say oh this this politicians a no
I mean the real kind I mean like oh my
God
kind so it seems to me that you're
watching uh a Clinton op on their own
team it looks like Clinton and Obama
realized they had to take control of
Alexander Soros because they need to
stop him funding the crazy and
keeping the or border open and funding
people who are going to cause riots and
all kinds of insane things because they
can't defend it when trying to get Biden
back in
office so did you know that uh Huma
abedine is 10 years older than Alexander
Soros did you see the photo the only
photo the only photo of them in
something that looks like a date if you
look at his hand you know she's cuddling
up to him at a booth in a restaurant
he's got his arm around her but look at
his
hand his hand looks like this he's got
his hand in a little like a loose fist
while it's around her
waist who poses for a photo with their
girlfriend puts their hand
around their back and does not put their
hand flat on the on the body of the
person who who hug somebody with an open
hand well you don't do that to your
girlfriend and I don't think that
somebody with billions of dollars is
dating somebody 10 years
older can you give me an example of the
other
billionaire who who decided to uh dat
somebody 10 years
older has there ever been a billionaire
who ever voluntarily got into a
relationship a male billionaire who got
into a relationship with somebody 10
years older even once now I mean I
realize that's an ugly thought but I've
never seen it have
you so I propose to you that uh this is
an op and that there's a game within the
game in which the Democrats are trying
to wrestle control of this big bank
called Soros
I believe that the senior Soros is
checked out and had no idea where his
money was going or what damage it was
doing because that's the part I didn't
understand I didn't understand the
correction I understood the original
goals they sound great on paper I don't
understand the lack of Correction and
the only way that makes sense is if
there was somebody who was controlling
Alex Alexander Soros to do the very
worst things that didn't make sense at
all but he was not capable enough or
strong enough to say no or even to know
what was wrong and so the fixer was sent
in and it
suuma what do you
say mystery
solved well here's the thing as long as
Alexander Soros doesn't give interviews
and I'm assuming he's turning him down
because he would be the most interesting
person you could ever interview um is
it's the most relevant to
everything there's a reason for that
right now if I'm wrong it would be easy
to sort it out you just have an
interview with him ask him the obvious
questions see if he can answer them
never going to happen never going to
happen but I think uh Hillary's got it
under
control all right
and that ladies and gentlemen is all I
have on that there's something you
didn't see on your other
podcast all right and again it's just
speculative so just in case somebody
wants to suum me I want I want to say I
don't know that any of this is
true I'm saying that if I were an FBI
profiler that's what it looks
like so it's my working assumption at
the moment that it's just exactly what
it looks like there's just a weak person
with billions of dollars and people are
wrestling to control him and I think
that's the whole
story all
right um I'm going to say uh bye to the
people on X and YouTube and
Rumble and
uh mro but mcon wasn't a billionaire he
he got in his relationship before he was
a billionaire or before he was
important so if you could come up with
other examples it'd be
fun all right everybody I'm going to say
uh going to stick with just the locals
people but I know there's a delay
here so I'm going to make sure that you
know that I'm going to close you down
and talk to locals only I think I've
stalled long enough see you tomorrow
same place same time and locals here I
come
