good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I'm pretty sure nobody's ever had more
fun than this
and if you'd like your experience to be
the kind of experience that you'll tell
your grandkids and your grandkids
grandkids because you probably are
Immortal you'll be around all you need
is a cup of Margaret a glass of tanker
Chelsea Steiner canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamedia the day the thing that
makes everything better it's cold the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
ah
oh
that's the sound of a man who got a new
coffee maker and it's just lighting me
up is everybody familiar that you all
know that Greg guffeld has a new book
out
probably the best cover I've ever seen
in a book
if you've not bought this well I'm sure
you will
so go buy that book
my book will be on a few weeks so you
want to read this book
Greg's book and make sure that you're
done with that completely done with that
and then you'll be ready for a new book
and I'll tell you about that later
well the uh
the Twitter headquarters in San
Francisco has
caused some San Francisco's a little
concern because it put a new logo on top
of the building a giant X
a gigantic ax
all right uh we are required by law to
make jokes about the gigantic X on top
of the Twitter
am I right
this is why you come to me
hey there was a new thing that happened
again Scott mock it yes I can
let me put a little effort into it
stretch the stretching is important
before joke making a lot of people
forget the stretching and then they'll
tell a joke and they'll just sprain
something but I like to stretch first
all right
there's an x a giant X on the top of the
Twitter headquarters in San Francisco
hold on hold on
is it because
the the poop app for San Francisco
finally added a summary feature
okay that's the best I can do did you
know there's actually an app in San
Francisco that citizens can use to Mark
where there's human feces on a sidewalk
and do you know why they stopped using
it
because the app became solid Brown
there were so many reports of feces on
sidewalks that you could no longer see
individual markings it just became a big
brown pile
and so I thought
wouldn't it be an upgrade instead of
having all those individual brown spots
you know mentioned you could just have
one gigantic X
that marks the city to stay away from
now I think that that musk can take this
further and find other cities to stay
away from
I've got my eye on Oakland
I don't want to jump the gun but if I
had to pick a second City to stay there
Frick away from it'd probably be Oakland
and you know who agrees with me the
NAACP
so the NAACP put out a statement that
says my goodness is too dangerous to
live in Oakland because of all the crime
this is the same NAACP uh it's on a Mike
serovich tweet that uh around the
pandemic times said you know what we
need is less funding for police that's
what we need
about divert that funding for the police
into other beneficial areas
well I wonder how that worked out hmm
high crime area
fewer police resources how I don't know
which way is that going to go
ah I don't know that's too hard to
predict but
it turns out that it went in the
direction of it I know this surprised a
lot of people in the direction of more
crime
actually turning the city into an
unlivable hellhole
where before it was just a hellhole but
now it's an unlivable hellhole and
NAACP says you know we could use would
be some more police that'd be good
so nobody saw that coming
Elon Musk tweeted something that might
sound political to you
he said it's time for Lindsey Graham to
retire
now it looked like it was related to the
Ukraine war situation in Lindsey Graham
being a proponent of continued ongoing
uh funding and fighting I guess and but
I but I have to ask this question
is that a political opinion
is it
when Elon Musk says that in in a tweet
or a post or whatever they call you now
it's time for Lindsey Graham to retire
he's 68 by the way
is that a political opinion
it it is it is and it isn't but here's
the part that it isn't
if uh if Joe Biden
took off all of his clothes and went
running down you know the street in
Washington DC
and then you sat in a tweet you know I
think it's time for Joe Biden to retire
would that be a political opinion
isn't there some point where it's just
not really political at that point
there's some point where everybody's
just can see the same thing
right and I that's that was the feeling
I had with this is that you know first
of all normally the people on the left
believe that Elon is going to be you
know leading right right people on the
left all think he leaves right but
here's his opinion about a republican
that he should retire
I don't think that's a political opinion
that does not feel political to me that
feels like there is a one individual who
went so far that this should not even be
a political opinion
you know it's sort of in that weird gray
area where I'm not sure I'm not just not
so sure that that's political at all
but uh I I always appreciate seeing
transparency so I like knowing his
opinion
um
here is a shocker
you know I always track CNN's reporting
on politics
because I like to Intuit where the
management of CNN is telling people to
go you know you you assume that the
hosts of CNN have a little bit of
flexibility but probably the overall
direction comes from management at least
it seems that way
in the past so here are some maybe small
chefs
that to me are obvious because I I read
CNN all the time on the website and I
want to see if this looks the same way
to you
so Stefan Collinson who does opinion
pieces on CNN which are universally you
know just the worst anti-trump pieces so
the thing you need to know is that he's
most famous for consistently writing
Trump is bad Trump is bad Trump is bad
that's pretty much his full-time job
and here he writes about I guess the
Republicans had an event in Iowa Trump
was a speaker as were the others and
Stefan Collinson said well actually look
at the headline I'll read it to you
uh if only I'd written it down but it
was a positive headline about Trump and
how he was staying on script and why it
was clear he was leading
it was interesting
so you know Collinson slipped into it
um you know some commentary about
Trump's legal problems so that was a big
theme of the piece as well but the but
the larger theme was that despite all of
the attacks on Trump on the legal end
that when Trump showed up he was the
only one with a standing ovation
the Lesser candidates who who tried who
dared to criticize him got booed
and anybody watching that event can see
that Trump is at full power
I mean that's my my words not his now
that's a very unusual take
in my opinion unless there's some trick
going on where they really want Trump to
be the nominee and they're pretending
that they don't or something or but to
me it looked like
um some kind of shift
like a slightly more positive
shift I don't know if it's strategic or
they're just trying to be a little bit
more down the middle but it's very it
was uh quite obvious
about imagine somebody who is an
anti-trumper saying that Trump stayed on
script got a standing ovation and it's
obvious why he's leading the pack
that's quite a thing
and you know even in the context of he's
got all these legal issues it was saying
that the Republicans are brushing them
off is not important
very interesting
all right uh
you have to watch a clip on CNN it's on
there right now on the website of
Caitlin Collins talking to Leon Pineda
Panetta and ask him if he has any
regrets for signing the now infamous
letter that says that the lap cut that
the under Biden's laptop was Russian
disinformation
now imagine being on CNN
and CNN Su if you regret signing that
letter that's CNN
CNN basically taking Leon Panetta to
task for citing a letter
did you think you'd ever see that
that's kind of interesting
to me that feels like a shift when you
put it together with a Stefan Collinson
article that was clearly saying that
Trump has something going for him that
his base likes you know but also mention
the legal problems which is entirely
fair that is the context
but here but you have to see Leon
Panetta lie
and now I'm going to say it's a lie
that's an opinion right I can't read his
mind
but
one of the one of the tricks that I like
to teach you this is very important by
the way this is this is a life skill so
I recommend this whenever you know
there's a situation where you know
somebody is lying and this is different
from suspecting right if you suspect
somebody's lying this won't help you
because you don't know for sure but in
those rare situations where you can know
for sure somebody's lying
watch how they do it
you will learn how Liars lie by watching
people lie in a public setting when you
know they're lying you know when there's
no doubt about it so certainly nobody
could be happy about signing the
the laptop letter
would you agree
would you agree there's no real question
that it was an op and that anybody asked
about it would have to lie to say why
they signed it
you've got to watch Leon Panetta blink
and squirm when he answers it it is like
it's like he's got some kind of a
digestive problem well I'm so glad I did
it because really
the point of it oh oh was to uh show the
people because I think the people needed
to know uh that uh that Russians do try
to they do try to influence elections so
in that was sense in kind of a way that
is not exactly on point it showed that I
was really right and I don't really I
don't regret that at all
now I might be exaggerating a little bit
his squirming but there's some squirming
so there's two things interesting about
this one you should watch it to learn
how people look when they lie
every time you can find one of these
situations where there's no question
about the lying
wash it once
watch it twice
watch it three times and then see what
you see every time you watch it it'll be
a little a little different by the third
time you watch it you're going to see
things you didn't see in the first time
you really can pick up the mannerisms
once you once you learn to detect it and
that's all you really need to do just
just pay attention to people in their
life
now I'm going to tell you something that
I probably shouldn't admit
that if you want to find out if there's
somebody in your life who's lying to you
the moment you find out that you know
they're lying
make sure you get them to lie again to
your face once you know it's a lie
and watch them
you're going to know how far that person
can go
can you look me right in the eye
with a straight face and lie to me
because if you can
we're kind of done here you know we're
done whatever your relationship is to
that person at that point you have to be
done
if they can lie to your face
but if they can't if they score them if
they score them likely on padetta and
you say okay well at least I can tell
when you're lying at least it's obvious
and maybe maybe you might decide to live
with that if you can tell
but if somebody can do it to your face
and not make any sign that they're lying
you need to run away from that
all right I told you a story yesterday
that I got community note checked on so
uh my current understanding is that what
I told you was completely wrong
which was a story about RFK Jr saying
that he was denied Secret Service
protection from
mayorkas's group and I speculated online
about uh
majorcus acting like I'm not accusing
him I'm saying he's acting like somebody
who's blackmailed
because his decisions didn't make sense
to me however
according to Twitter Community notes RFK
Jr would not be eligible for such
protection because you're not eligible
until you're 120 days away from the
election and we're 400 Days plus from
the election
so
I'm a little bit concerned
that this story went as far as it did
um without me getting fact checked
meaning I saw a number of people
reporting it I saw RFK Jr tweet it and
I've I don't know any situations in
which he's ever intentionally lied and
it seems like he would know the details
of this and be aware of it so there's
something else missing in the story but
I don't know what it is
so here's what I'd recommend
you got to hear what RFK JR says in
response
to the debunking of his claim
he might say well but in some situation
blah blah blah this is a special case I
don't know I don't know what he would
say but do you think the RFK Jr was not
aware
that he was completely ineligible for
Secret Service protection
does it sound like does it sound likely
that he would have gone through this
whole process he's been trying to get it
and he would be unaware
that he was completely unqualified to
get that protection
could that be true
I'm going to say there's something wrong
with the fact Jackie here
but I do love
when I get fact checked on on Twitter or
contacts checked I guess Community note
checked
so
um so this is the is it the second or
third time that I've had a community
note added to a tweet
if I mentioned it two or three times but
at least two
and I'll tell you my reaction to it is
all positive
my first reaction is negative
my first reaction is damn it how dare
you how dare you question my tweet that
is of course perfect
and then you know after it sinks in a
little bit you think about it for 10
minutes you're like oh damn it that
really helped right I so I left it up I
left the Tweet up because I would rather
leave the Tweet up with the correction
than to delete the Tweet does that seem
like the better way to play it
that feels like the better way right
because we don't really have a there's
no standard the set yet so you we're
kind of
just guessing my thing is better to show
the mistake or or even show that
somebody says this mistake because it
might be at another Counterpoint to that
so I'd be very interested in how this uh
shakes out
we'll see
other stories I told you that apparently
are complete I I seem to be on
a little bit of a streak
reporting stories that are complete
 but uh remember the story about
superconductivity at room temperature
the fast version is superconductivity
usually only works at extreme low
temperatures if you could get it to work
at room temperature it would be one of
the great breakthroughs of all all
civilization
maybe it wasn't that so much
and I saw a physicist named Alex Kaplan
who's who's saying that there's
something going on so in other words
whatever the experiment showed there is
something going on but it might not be
superconductivity it might be something
that they call a diamagnetic effect
so there might be something that's
looking like the effect of
superconductivity but it would be like a
limited little thing that's not actual
superconductivity it would be something
that could make a magnet float
like superconductivity could but for a
different reason so you might be making
the magnet float but it's not a
superconductivity
so we don't know for sure that it's not
but I would say that the betting odds
have tipped toward it not being super
conductivity
but we'll probably know pretty soon
because people will try to people try to
reproduce it
uh all right
so
um
this UFO story
I find that it produced something super
useful that I wasn't expecting
and the super useful thing is it tells
us who the dumb people are
isn't that useful
to know who believes the UFO story
yeah I saw Ted Liu who's famous Democrat
now I would disagree with Ted Liu about
you know 99 of every opinion because Ted
Lou is more of a
public partisan you know he's one of the
ones that mixes it up on Twitter and
stuff but I love Ted Lou
um I and I I think he's a perfect model
of you know maybe a more polite way to
live life
you know because I've interacted with
them on Twitter a number of times he's
sort of like a a happy warrior
like he's not a complete jerk he's just
pushing his team's side he doesn't make
any bones about the fact that he's a
team player but he's just not a jerk
I just kind of like him
it's kind of a cool kind of a cool guy
but anyway he said today the UFO story
is uh I'm sorry he said that it was
unlikely the UFO story is real because
the government can't keep that kind of a
secret
now that's just one reason it might not
be real but uh yeah I I agree so Ted Liu
you have passed the dangerously gullible
test you are not dangerously gullible
so all I can disagree with Ted Liu on a
vast range of policy things I can
absolutely agree with him that he has
the intelligence necessary to be a U.S
Congress person
now that doesn't sound like a big deal
does it it doesn't sound like a big deal
that I said somebody has the necessary
intellect to be in Congress
but remember the context you got Mitch
McConnell who's freezing up like an
animatronic you got Dianne Feinstein
who's you know non-functional you got
fetterman who's God knows what's going
on you got Joe Biden you've got Kamala
Harris we have a whole bunch of
prominent people who clearly are not
capable
for one reason or another not capable
but Ted Lewis
his brain works he just disagrees with
you that's fine
all right uh
this Hunter plea deal
I'm positive that the problem
well let's say the challenge not the
problem
the challenge with that if you're let's
say a Republican and you'd like to
really push this Hunter Biden criminal
you know Biden crime family thing I
really want everybody to understand how
bad it is
do you know what the problem is
the problem is that unless you see the
whole thing explained you know sort of
like bullet point this happened this
happened this happened this happened the
things we know we're not even talking
about the things we speculate about just
the things we know you just list them
and and the story is completely damning
completely credible sounding
and really really important like really
really important but imagine that you
didn't get your news
from long tweet threads by kanakoa the
great who perfectly summarizes things
suppose you didn't get your news from
watching Jesse waters on the five
perfectly summarized in bullet points
the story he did a great job the other
day you know putting it in context if
you didn't if you don't watch those very
specific news sources with very very
well
let's say well-designed summaries you
wouldn't really understand this story at
all
imagine if you were a Democrat and the
only thing you knew about it was you
dipped in and you heard a new fact
you're like I don't know maybe maybe not
and then you dipped out
and then three days later you dip in
there's another headlight oh there's a
thing about a hunter thing that I don't
I can't remember is that the same thing
as the last thing are we on the same
topic right so so the way the the left
side of the media works as long as you
can keep people in your bubble
they will never know
what the Biden crime family did
you you show me the here's a challenge
show me a clearly left here's a this is
a good challenge let's see if we can do
this find me a clearly left-leaning
Outlet could be a video or written
anybody on the left
who has summarized the you know the
breadth of charges against the Biden
crime family in a way that even a
Democrat could read it and say oh wow
I didn't know all this stuff
and when I see it all in one place it
really paints a clear picture it's only
when you see a fact the fact the fact
individually
that you can't get any picture
so show well no Matt type he doesn't
count yeah he's left-leaning but he's
also an independent journalist
so I'm not talking about independent
journalists I'm quite sure Matt taibi
can report bad news on both sides so
he's independent he just personally is
left-leading that's different
but show me like a CNN and MSNBC show me
a New York Times show me a Washington
Post the the entities that are the least
credible at least to people on the right
show me any one of them who summarize
the case
in other words show me anybody on the
left who actually reported the news in
context about what I would consider one
of the important news stories of the
last several years
I bet you won't find one
but then find it on the right so I
mentioned two sources you know katakari
the great this morning had a great
threat on it
um and Jesse Waters just two examples
I'm sure if you looked at Dan Bunch you
know I haven't seen it but you know I
can say with some confidence Dan bongino
without even seeing it you know that at
some point he laid it out I haven't seen
that Mark Levin talked about it recently
but I don't have to watch a show
to know that he laid it out in some
summery way that everybody could see the
problem so they're probably probably
dozens of places on the right where
you've seen the summary
but I'll bet there's not even one place
I bet there's not one place on the left
where they've ever summarized it so as
long as they don't summarize it
they can get away with reporting every
fact
without ever telling you the news
think about that
the left can hide this story while also
reporting every part of it
have you ever seen that before
I'm trying to think of another case
where that's the case they can report
every part of the story accurately oh
there was this the judge found this and
this was ruled and you know he's been
charged with this and all that
and they can still keep the news from
you while reporting all of the news
accurately
think about that they can tell you the
news completely accurately and when it
happens
and also keep all of the news from you
because the news only made sense when
you put it in context and they'll just
never do that
that's a really good trick
they'll never put it in context and that
Democrats will actually vote without
knowing what the news was
they won't have any idea
yeah all right
um
so one of the parts of the plea deal
that's just like mind-blowingly head
shakingly jaw-droppingly crazy
uh here's a detail that I guarantee you
nobody on the left
will ever be aware of
here's a good test in fact you could ask
ask your um let's say Democrat friends
if they've ever heard this
that one of the things that made the
hunter Biden plea agreement different
is that the the deal was for immunity
for some other activities that were not
part of the you know part of the charge
now that alone is pretty weird right
that you'd have a plea deal
that would give you immunity for
unrelated crimes that are not even
mentioned right so that that would be a
little unusual by itself but here's
what's more unusual
uh let's see if I get this right because
it's like a technical detail
and I think this came from kanakoa the
great if I believe so uh
they put the details of the plea deal
they were in two separate documents one
document is public that's the one that
the judge can say by law I guess there's
some separate document
that it's a diversion agreement and that
agreement doesn't have to be revealed to
the public it can remain confidential
so they took the details of what those
other crimes might be and put them in a
secret document that the public can't
know about and then asked a judge to say
that that the secret Document Plus the
public one we're all good
that's right they asked a judge to bless
a secret document
indirectly right that actually asked a
judge
to in a sense you know sort of some way
indirectly but in effect to bless a
secret agreement that even the judge
couldn't see
what
now it's a little bit Technical and even
when I try to explain it you're probably
saying I'm not quite getting that why
are there two documents but literally
nobody I don't think anybody ever tried
it before in the history of the law
because it was just so insanely
obviously wrong
to hide the point
usually if you can make a plea deal the
point of the deal is in the deal
they actually took the main point of the
deal and put it in a hidden document so
you didn't even know what the point of
it was
and tried to get away with that
and if it had not been you know a
legitimate judge who wanted to be a
legitimate person and serve the public
we never would have known imagine if
some jug imagine if some judge had
approved that
there must have been some feeling that
they could get it improved and they
wouldn't have gone that far
but was that close
I like to think that that was never
close that you know no judge would have
agreed to that but I'm not sure
I'm not really sure maybe they maybe
they had a good shot at getting a judge
to say yes to the most absurd thing you
could ever approve in your life
but it didn't happen
now you tell me do you believe do you
believe that you know any Democrat who
is aware of that detail
super important to understand the whole
story if you don't understand that the
important parts were put into secret
document which is not done
then you don't really understand
anything do you and that that feels
really critical to the understanding the
nature of how deep this
bad behavior is
all right so Democrats will never know
the news
um
so the story about the uh the new
charges about Trump allegedly trying to
delete some security footage because the
Box gate
uh I saw in a tweet by amuse
uh that's the name of the Tweeter amuse
uh that it's hearsay
that the evidence is uh there's a a long
guy heard it from a maintenance guy
that's the nature of the evidence
a law a lawn care guy heard it from a
maintenance guy
but there's no direct evidence
that Trump said it
or that it happened so there's no
evidence that anything got deleted
is it a crime if he asked about deleting
things or even asked for it is it a
crime if he asks for something to be
deleted and is not deleted
how does that work is it is it
obstruction of justice
let's say hypothetically he had a
conversation like this hypothetically
is there any reason we can't just delete
all the videos so we don't have any
problems
because I would if I knew that I could
legally delete all of my video
I would do it as long as it's legal I
would get rid of anything that could
cause me an unrelated problem right
because there's lots going on in
Mar-A-Lago that maybe has nothing to do
with boxes
but you don't want anybody to say it's a
private place in you know at least
partly private so it makes complete
sense that you would have a conversation
about deleting your security video
and now suppose he actually said well
let's go ahead and do it because I don't
think that's illegal
maybe because I don't know the details
but
If he if he thought there was an
argument that it would be legal to do
he doesn't have to be right you just
have to ask to think there's an argument
for it and then he asks for it to be
done is that obstruction of justice
let's say the the videos have not been
asked for or he thought that the videos
did not have any actual evidence of the
crime but might have evidence of other
things that are sort of embarrassing
would it be illegal
and I think the legal opinion is it
depends right
that's right so it's a gray area it
would depend a lot
so do you think anybody else would have
been charged with this
if the quality of the information is
that there may or may not have been a
phone call that somebody told somebody
else about but then nothing actually
happened there may have been just a
conversation about it
that doesn't feel like a crime to me
now I'm not an expert but
is it a crime to
even if I imagine you could turn this
into tactical crime I can't imagine
anybody else being charged with
something like this
can you
oh oh thank you Snoopy boobs thanks I
appreciate you pointing out that I'm not
a lawyer because I don't think anybody
would understand that you know a lot of
you are confused you probably thought I
was a lawyer the way I was so expertly
dealing with the issue so I'm glad you
pointed out because there were a lot of
people on YouTube like is this man a
lawyer he seems brilliant in his
jurisprudence I don't even know if
that's the right word to use there but
I'm glad that you cleared that up that
I'm not a lawyer and you know what I was
also not aware of that
I thought I was a lawyer
but it turns out I'm not
so thank you
all right uh
I saw a tweet somebody found the
Tate Brothers PhD program did you know
the Tate Brothers had a PhD program it
was a course that people could sign up
for and the PHD you sent stood for uh
Pimpin hoe's degree
the Pimpin hoes
and they're a bunch of materials shown
if they're real it suggests that he was
teaching people how to
turn girlfriends into sex workers on
webcams
so he had the Tate Brothers PhD program
for turning girlfriends
into sex workers
now
I wasn't going to say this but that was
my backup School
yeah
Tate Brothers PhD program was my backup
School My First Choice was the hunter
Biden laptop University
where I would learn also
similar lessons about pimpanos but a
different approach
so yeah the tape Brothers PhD program
that was my backup School
that's all I got on that one
that was a long way to go for a bad joke
backup school all right uh the CNN's
reporting that Ted Cruz
um is one of those seats that is likely
to flip in 2024 so Senator Ted Cruz
might not be a senator after 2024 if CNN
has their way or their prediction is
right
now
I want to see if you see the same thing
I do
you ever have these situations where you
feel like you can see the future
has anybody ever had that
like every now and then there's a
situation where
it's not like you're predicting it's
like you're seeing it
am I wrong that Ted Cruz is going to be
on the Supreme Court
am I wrong
do you see it
because I swear to God I just see it
like I don't predict it
I'm not predicting it I just see
it
I mean I see him in the robe I see him I
see him in office
I just see it like it's real I see it
like it's the past
like I I can't I can't even wrap my head
around the fact that it couldn't happen
or wouldn't happen
I just see it
now I don't know if there's going to be
what's the next opening that's likely to
happen who's the next oldest
Supreme Court Justice
who's the oldest one Thomas
how old is Thomas
early 70s
he's 80. Justice Thomas is 80.
well don't you think that he would most
likely be
replaced with an African-American
candidate
somebody says he's 75 okay yeah I don't
think he's going anywhere he looks like
he's in pretty good shape last time I
saw a photo of him I mean he doesn't
look his age he looks like he's going to
be fine for a while
well I do think that even a republican
would be
um maybe
incentivized to make sure there's some
diversity on the Supreme Court
the Supreme Court is one of those places
where uh putting a little uh effort into
diversity makes sense to me and I hope
you know
that's a very big exception from all of
my other opinions
the Supreme Court is the one place
that I don't mind that they put a little
effort into diversity
now I'm not sure that they're picking in
every case I don't know that they picked
the most capable person
so I don't believe that they have picked
all winners but it doesn't mean you know
it's not because of diversity they just
may have picked some bad candidates but
I do think you should put a little work
into it I don't think you should obsess
by it and I don't think it should
necessarily be a minimum like
requirement
so if you if you can't find people that
are you know first rate
then no
does that make you feel any better if
you if in a weird world in which you
literally had no candidates
the satisfied your minimum requirements
for competence then no no not in that
case but I do think the Supreme Court is
different from anything else in that is
credibility with the public is the
primary thing that keeps the country
together
and I don't think anybody could argue
that it would be more credible if it was
all a bunch of white men
it wouldn't be more credible
so if you could get something like the
same performance but it looks a little
more diverse that seems like a service
that would seem like a benefit to the
country
and remember I'm not the one I don't I
don't want to see that kind of activity
in corporations I don't want to see it
in schools or anyplace else don't want
to say it in my personal life but
certainly the Supreme Court is different
than everything else it's not like
anything else its credibility has to be
a plus all the time or else everything
falls apart and I think a little bit of
diversity
is exactly the kind of thing that makes
the country go well you know at least at
least my opinion is being heard through
this person
yeah and by the way this would be very
much a category where I would I would uh
I would totally respect
a competing opinion
I I think that needs to be called out I
like to call that out when I can there
are sometimes when I have an opinion and
if you have the opposite opinion I would
think you were kind of an idiot
you know what I mean there are plenty of
those this isn't one of those if you
want to argue with me no the Supreme
Court cannot
consider diversity you know in terms of
their the people that are on it
I'd be okay with that
I would say that would be a credible
uh well
probably well thought out opinion it's
just I have a different one
and I think
I think it's fair
when you say this is my opinion but I
actually would completely respect an
opposite opinion
completely respected
all right
um
what else is going on
I saw that there's some news on social
media anyway the fake ramaswamy wanted
to re-enter their TPP agreement
that Trump took us out of and canceled
did you see that news
I think it's new news right I don't know
if it's old news it didn't have a date
on it but looked like it was new and
then I saw somebody say oh he's he took
himself out of the race because he you
know can't possibly win if he's a big
globalist and wants to be part of the
TPP but correct me if I'm wrong
Trump's problem with the TPP was not the
concept of a TPP
I need a fact check on this my
understanding is that Trump disagreed
because it was poorly negotiated
am I right
Trump never said I would never agree to
anything that had the words TPP I
believe Trump said the way it's
negotiated hard no
hard no the way you negotiated it but if
I were negotiating it
maybe yes
because maybe maybe we get something we
like so when you hear Vivek say we
should rejoin it if you don't include
there what he thinks you should do in
terms of negotiating before you agree to
rejoin
I feel like this is misreported
yeah the the one thing you need to get
right about Vivek is that he's not a
simpleton
he's not saying yes or no on something
like a TPP
do you know who says yes or no on
something as complicated as the TPP
people who don't understand it
if you don't understand it you've
probably got a firm opinion yes or no if
you do understand it you probably know
that it's got some good some bad and if
you could
negotiate it to be more good than bad
worth considering
is that crazy
to me this is exactly who you want as
your president you want your president
to know
like Trump does
that is not good or bad it's good if you
negotiate it right it's bad if you don't
is that a problem
I don't think so
um
it's certainly not a reason why you
can't win it's not going to stop them
from winning
there might be other
things for winning like Trump
all right so Trump I guess was at the
same Iowa Event said he would sign a law
apprehending child why he calls child
sexual mutilation in all 50 states and
it would take away funding for schools
that tried to do CRT and Dei and other
racist policies
um and he said that he was the first
president in decades who didn't start a
war
now
every time you hear Trump speak after
you haven't been saturated with him too
much
do you always have the same opinion I do
which is why is he so clear
do you ever have that opinion why is
this so clear
and why doesn't why don't other people
do it
why can't other people that be this
unambiguous and this clear and when I
was listening to this the specific all
three of these see if you find something
that these have in common
so one was about you would prohibit what
he calls child sexual mutilation in all
50 states no funding for the
crtdi stuff the the racist policies and
first president who didn't start a war
what do all three of those sound like
dad
dad
those are dad policies
hey Mom hey Mom what do you think about
um you know child reassignment surgeries
well you know uh you know in some
situations you know these situations
blah blah blah some exceptions yeah I
could see in some how about uh funding
for CRT and Di well they're very
important you know I could see you'd
have a problem but they're very
important you know how about uh not
starting any wars well sometimes there's
a reason for a war you know you might
have to you know you got to fight them
there before they come over here right
all these nuance and maybe and if that
and risk reward and Trump just says I'm
going to prohibit sexual mutilation in
50 states cut funding for all this
racist in schools and by the
way I'm the first president who didn't
start it in some dumb Wars
dad
three letters
dad
you could feel the dadness of that can't
you
that that is pure male
pure male
and sometimes you need pure mail
you know what you don't want when you're
talking about maybe it should be okay to
do these surgeries on minors
you I'll tell you what you don't want
mom
sorry I love Mom
s are great I'm very pro pro mom I could
not be more Pro mom but on these three
questions War CRT Dei and
um the the gender reassignment stuff
surgeries for children those are three
topics
I don't want to hear from women
don't want to hear from women
am I going to get in trouble for that
I'm already canceled blah ha ha you
can't cancel me
you cannot over cancel me now and keep
in mind
I love women
love moms and I also think that they're
very smart and capable and you know blah
blah blah nothing negative
right now could you think of other other
decisions where you wouldn't want Dad to
be involved
maybe maybe there are decisions that you
really want Mom to be involved in yes
yes well abortion actually good good
decision all right my opinion is very
similar for abortion keep the guys out
of it
keep the guys out of it now I'm not
telling you you shouldn't have an
opinion on it or not vote on it because
you're your own person I have nothing to
do with your votes or your personal
decisions I'm just saying personally
that's another one that I would make a
gender distinction I'd say yeah I think
women should decide what the law is
because it's not going to be that
different than what men would decide I
don't think men and women are quite that
different on abortion it's more of a
left right thing
but we would have a better situation
if the women decided and then the men
said you know even if I don't like it
I'm going to respect that men don't have
babies
generally speaking
so
I and I feel that Trump more than
anybody maybe any president ever maybe
any public figure ever he understands
the true nature of human beings
just better than other people
and I think that instinctively whether
he says this out loud or not he
instinctively knows it's time for Dad to
say things right
don't you think
I I feel like he's just saying it's Dad
time but he doesn't use those words he's
just he's giving you
pure male energy
against some questions which I would
only want pure male energy to be applied
to I don't really want any female energy
in any of these questions
but like I said there's really a place
where the female energy would be the
superior
Superior approach
all right
Trump apparently lost his bid to sue CNN
over
the big lie so CNN sort of branded Trump
as the big lie a guy over January 6.
was that it yeah Jeremy six and of
course the big lie comes from Nazi lower
you know the big lie was
Goebbels saying if your lie is big
enough people will believe it
and so Trump sued because that basically
was calling him a Nazi
and the judge threw it out because it's
obviously just an opinion it's you know
political speech and opinion and cannot
be protected because nobody takes it as
a literal
but that's an interesting opinion isn't
it
that nobody would take it as anything
but an opinion
well actually it's not about what you
take it as it's about what it was
intended as right it doesn't matter how
you interpret it it matters how the
person who did it you know why they did
it what was their intention I think I
think that matters more but uh so I
guess it has been
but
Sarah gray area
because if you're the if you're the
entity that assigns opinions to other
people
that work with me here
let's say the situation is the CNN just
keeps saying it's the big lie which
makes you sound like Trump is a Nazi
so so let's say that we agree that CNN
is just giving opinions
so that's legal they're just giving
opinions but here's the part that's left
out of this
where does the public get their opinions
the public gets their opinions from CNN
and whatever they watch
so if CNN is saying well it's just our
opinion that he's a Nazi but the net
effect of that is that the people who
are Their audience come up with the
opinion that he's actually a Nazi
like maybe not card carrying but that in
effect he's a Nazi
look that's legal apparently because CNN
would just be giving an opinion but the
law is silent on the fact that that
opinion becomes fact to the people who
are watching it because the people
watching it don't think it's an opinion
they think they learned the news
am I right
they think they got the news so they
think oh my God they just told me he's a
Nazi he must be a Nazi
so
it's a weird area
yeah yeah I guess because Trump's a
public figure it makes it nearly
impossible to sue because if you know
that
that it's political speech I just don't
know how it could ever be illegal so I
think probably the uh the legal system
got the right answer on that what do you
think
I think the legal system got the right
answer on that given the nature of the
law
everybody agree yeah that was the right
answer
and I'm not sure I want to live in a
world where you could sue a news entity
that easily
oh and when
I wouldn't I wouldn't want him to win on
that that would be too chilling for the
entire industry
all right yeah I don't like it but it's
the correct answer that is correct
all right ladies and gentlemen is there
any topic I forgot today
uh
all right
and apparently there's some somebody
produced a quote from Trump or something
you knew Trump a long time ago
saying that you know telling a large lie
was part of his strategy
I think that's hearsay is too
uh Vivek and Elon yeah so so there was a
spaces I didn't catch it
so there's a spaces with Vivek and Elon
um
and I saw some good things said about
that
um are we seeing the defection of
DeSantis people yet to Vivek
as that happened
I I feel like we're starting to see just
a little bit of a a little bit of a
trend
um
no you're not seeing it
yeah probably not yet I don't think it's
reflected in the polls but I feel like
there's a Zeitgeist kind of a thing
happening
now I saw a tweet that I can't confirm
that suggests that uh Vivek ramaswamy
and Jared Kushner are friends
have you heard that
do you think for fake and Jared Kushner
are like personal friends
uh uh somebody said they had lunch or
something now I saw that claim
and my my first reaction was
oh that's that's quite big news that two
prominent people who went to Harvard
would have a dinner a meal together
they both went to Harvard
I don't think their ages are that
different
so is it some big surprise that two
Harvard guys interested in politics
about the same age
had lunch and maybe liked each other
that feels like a non-story
you know the the app that I would love
I would love to see an app that showed
who knows
who
wouldn't you love that wouldn't you like
to see like a visual map of this person
is you know work for this person in
their Law Firm but you know is good
friends with this person they're married
to this person who works for this Law
Firm wouldn't that be fascinating then
every so every time you saw a news
report
imagine this so I just told you about
Leon Panetta right so Leon padetta was
asked about signing the document that
said the laptop was Russian
disinformation wouldn't you love to see
it when you're watching that story
wouldn't you love to see the visual map
of Leon Panetta and who he's most
connected to in politics it'd be like
you know Hillary Clinton and then blah
blah blah that would mean a lot to me
because because that's the context that
if you don't have it you don't know
anything
yeah everything's a mystery if you don't
know who knows who knows who so the the
big
the big news is usually who knows who
who's working for who was married to
that sort of thing and we don't get that
reported generally yeah we act like the
surface news is the news but really to
understand it you'd have to know who
knows who and who's working for who and
all that
so that'd be good
um
as he touched the wall I think so he's
Pro wall right ifake is pro wall
now I'd also love to see if the Vape
could solve
uh for actually getting it built
um oh Dave Rubin says he'll be for Trump
if he's the nominee well I feel like
that's going to be true for all the
DeSantis supporters
does anybody think that
the DeSantis people won't go to Trump
do you I I think they do
I think they do
uh is Vivek Muslim Indian Hindu or Hindu
Indian oh let's talk about that
um
my understanding is that
he says that God is real
so every day every day Vivek tweets I
think every day he tweets it that God is
real
do Hindus believe in one God I don't
even know what what's going on there
um
you know so yeah
my understanding that is that he's Hindu
by
um ethnicity
but that he is he believes in one God
in those believe everyone can be God
okay I'm not I'm not a Hindu expert so
one God many forms
um
Hindu is mono I guess I guess I don't
know anything about I thought he was I
thought he was identifying as Christians
but I didn't know
is that not true doesn't he identify as
Christian
I thought that was well understood but
now you're confusing me
um
well
I don't know so I don't I've heard some
people think that you couldn't trust him
because he has some like Hindu
connections
have you ever met any Hindus
how many of you think that's a problem
of ever even met like even one Hindu
have you ever met a Hindu that like you
thought was a problem
so where I live there's a a very large
indian-american population
so I'm I'm continuously talking to
interacting with friends with playing
tennis with you know Indians with Hindu
backgrounds
I have not seen one Indian Hindu or
somebody who has a Hindu background that
you would consider even a little bit of
a problem you know in terms of some
belief they have that would conflict
with some of your beliefs there's no
conflicting belief there might be
different beliefs
but you're not going to find any you're
not going to find any Hindu beliefs that
bother you
and I don't even think you're going to
find a Hindu who bothers you all right
it's a it's a pretty Pleasant culture
you're going to be pretty happy in a
room full of Hindus let me tell you that
if you get invited if you get invited to
a party
where everybody there is let's say lives
in America but they have Hindu
backgrounds that's a fun party you could
have you could have a good time at that
party
so I I think you have to release on that
whole
you have some problem because he's got
some Hindu background I I think maybe
you're confusing Hindu with something
else
but you're not going to have a problem
with any Hindu beliefs at all
yeah you're just gonna have better food
if you angry if you hang around with
people from with a Hindu background you
the biggest thing you'll notice is that
the food is better that's it that's
about it
all right yeah Hindu is not Muslim
I think some people might be confusing
the two
Norm says Scott loves brown people well
that's true
are you saying that like is a bad thing
what's wrong with loving black brown
people
you racist
all right
um
[Music]
Economist is Indian food is pretty
amazing
I ate Indian food last night
it's always the best
all right
um
shot do you think really is like the
mendelbruct what you think reality is
like a mandelbrot fractal well I wish I
had a nickel for every time somebody
asked me if reality is like a mental
from fractal
and the answer is
no
I think no
all right um
can Congress regulate the Supreme Court
I don't know that issue
uh Tulsi gabbard is religious she's
Hindu
yeah let me just tell you don't worry
about your news
you're in good hands that's not going to
be a problem
uh Mandel brought what
all right Mitch McConnell is hypnotized
no you you know what's going on with
Mitch McConnell don't you
uh people on locals should I do my Mitch
McConnell uh all right I need to confer
with the locals people for a moment so
if you're on YouTube Don't listen to any
of this
hey locals um
should I do my impression of Mitch
McConnell being body snatched
body snatched yes
I'm getting yeses yes all right all
right they talked me into it
I know it was reported that maybe Mitch
McConnell had a health problem
but I don't think it's a coincidence
that the UFO hearings were at the same
time
as you know aliens from other planets
like to body snatch
and I'm pretty sure that what we saw was
McConnell getting body snatched
so I'd like to give you my impression
of somebody being body snatched
well yes I had a difficult recovery I
had some uh has some health problems but
we're better looking good
would you want to take any more
questions
hey Mitch you want to go back to the
room
now that's that's when the snatching
happens
what happens after the snatching and you
I think you've seen it uh it's the same
thing that happens with Joe Biden
because once the alien inhabits the body
they don't know how to work the mouth
and the arms and legs are they're just
testing it out
so if you look at Joe Biden trying to
walk he was obviously body snatched a
while ago if you watch Biden walkies
now if you've watched Men In Black at
all the thing you want to look for
is when McConnell after he you know he's
snatched
you want to see if his walking is any
different right there's an old guy so
prior to being body snatched he probably
walked a little like this
sort of slow
that's what I'm guessing after a body
snatch you've all watched Men In Black
you know how this works after the body
snatches sort of like this
right so look for that
foreign
I've got a watch list I'm watching uh
John fetterman probably body snatched
Kamala Harris I think is obvious
would you all agree the caballerus was
body snatched you know early on
all right because you know regular
people talk like this well I'd like to
tell you a story about a yellow school
bus but body snatch people talk like
this well
punished
quite a few body snatched
alien inhabited politicians
and yeah maybe that's maybe that's
something we should look into you know
what I mean all right ladies and
gentlemen of
YouTube that's all for now I'm going to
talk to you in the morning
because
you had such a good time today you're
coming back tomorrow
foreign
