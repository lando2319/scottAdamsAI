good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams I'm
pretty sure nobody listening to this has
ever had a better day and if you'd like
to take it up to levels that nobody
could even imagine all you need is a cup
of mug or a glass a tiger chalices dying
a canteen geographlass a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the day the
thing that makes everything better and
yes I am wearing a colorful shirt it's
called the simultaneous set but happens
now go
oh that's so good so good ah
it's the liquid of the Gods
well Joe Biden has completely solved the
problem of police officers abusing black
motorists we have had no more George
Floyd's since uh Biden has been elected
now I think you should count that as one
of his biggest accomplishments because
we went from a massive problem indeed
maybe the biggest problem in the black
community
according to the coverage and it went
from the biggest problem in the world to
basically nothing
that was pretty good
I think we could solve climate change
the same way
and just like Republicans and stop
watching the news
you'd never know there was a problem
like literally you would never know
you just think the weather was bad if
there was a problem
all right
here's a uh prediction I made that is
today in the Wall Street Journal
now I bragged about this before but the
fact that it's a major it's a major
article in the Wall Street Journal today
Now give me a fact Jack when did the
Ukraine war start
about 18 months ago
was it a year ago
so 18 19 months ago all right
so when that started my prediction was
if you remember do you remember my
prediction
that the Russian army would not be
successful
because of drones
and that they wouldn't they wouldn't be
prepared for a drone defense
and the Wall Street Journal is reporting
today that huh it turns out that
traditional military operations don't
work so well if the other side has a lot
of drones
so the Wall Street Journal pretty much
saying that Ukraine's successes drone
related
now
how many times have I been mocked for
not being a military expert which of
course I'm not
but did nobody else realize that this
was going to be a drone War
I I was the person who had to bring this
up and everybody mocked me and said
Scott I don't think you understand how
strong the Russian army is compared to
Ukraine they're just going to march in
and take everything
and I said I know I think I'd keep an
eye on the sky
might be some surprises up there and
that's exactly where we are they drone
the Drone Advantage turns out to be
maybe the biggest variable in the war
maybe not the biggest but one of the
biggest
so my advice to you
is if you have a military question
you should ignore the generals because
you're going to be listening to somebody
like Mark milley
let me ask you this question yeah if
that I just want to just want to give
you an example of how bad things are in
the world
this is an honest question and only only
my viewers would answer it the way I
think you're going to answer it
if you had a choice of listening to my
military opinions
versus General Millie which ones are
more credible
me or general Millie
laughs
it is me
it's me because you can't trust that guy
and he doesn't look too smart
and if you look at who's predicted
better so far well well
now
my point is not my Brilliance although I
like to talk about that too my point is
that experts have no value anymore there
are no experts who can predict anything
at all
it's a coin flip
well Kerry lake is running gonna
announce that she'll run for Senate in
Arizona
which will be interesting it'll be a
three-way race because you'll have
Kirsten Cinema as uh
um independent Reuben Gallego as the
likely Democrat and so you'd have a
three-way race
do you think that Kerry Lake would win a
three-way light race
I feel like she might
seems like she'd have a good chance in
that
I don't know do you think an independent
could win
if they were if he had a strong
Republican
I don't know I think she's got a good
shot at that
um
so Mitch McConnell they propped him up
in public and stuck a hand up his ass
and moved his lips in a puppet fashion I
assume I mean I I don't know for sure
but I'm just making a logical assumption
based on what he said
and he said that and I quote
providing assistance for the ukrainians
to defeat the Russians
is our number one
priority
the number one priority
for the United States is funding the
Ukraine's to defeat the Russians
it's your number one priority
so does that sound like he's operating
independently
well we'll talk about the Republican
debate
but give me a fact Jack were there two
or three how many of the Republicans
debating another seven
um would agree with uh match that not
necessarily the number one priority but
that we have to do Ukraine funding
because if we don't fund Ukraine as Mike
Pence said if we don't fund Ukraine
China will try to attack and take Taiwan
does that connect in your mind does
those things make sense that China is
just watching us and like if they make
one slip in Ukraine we're going to take
Taiwan
does anybody think that China thinks
that way
to me that sounded like the dumbest ass
thing I've ever heard in my life it
sounds exactly like the thing you say
all right here's what it sounds like you
know how in high school or college
sometimes they'll do a fake debate
and they'll assign you your position
and you might be assigned a position you
don't believe but you got to do the best
you can you're like
um well you're funding Ukraine because
an vital National interest no uh we get
a fund Ukraine because uh
the wind
now uh we got to fund Ukraine because um
got it
fund Ukraine because the minds of the
Chinese leaders that we don't have
access to are clearly thinking that one
little slip up in Ukraine and boom
taiwan's gone
can't argue against that because you
can't read mind and schedule I can read
minds so I know that's what time is
planning but you can't
oh don't no don't even try don't try
don't try that's just one of my talents
I can read minds
but the rest of you cannot don't even
try don't even try
that that felt like that was Pence's
argument
that he could read the minds of the
Chinese leaders
that that looks like somebody who's
bought doesn't it
does that look like somebody who's who
thought out their own opinion or does it
look like somebody who needs to satisfy
their master
and maybe they want you to know that
they're just satisfying their Master
because they're too embarrassed
to act like it's their own opinion I
mean that that reason is so weak it's
almost like you said please I'm under
duress
I'm I'm being forced to say these things
but I want you to know I'm being forced
you know I'm going to give you a little
signal that this is under duress I'll
say the dumbest thing anybody could ever
say in public we think we'll lose Taiwan
yeah and then the other Republicans say
stuff like
well this is how we degrade Russia
because
Russia is our biggest threat
and all the bad things Russia has done
have we not told you of all the bad
things Putin has done well I don't think
anybody doubts Putin does bad things
it feels like we get that
but that does not necessarily mean you
fund a war forever
I'm not sure that the logic connects it
Putin is bad therefore we fund Ukraine
forever
oh okay
and China might take Taiwan if something
happens in Ukraine
I'm not gathered
not get it
compare those reasons to we're going
broke
the the going broke part is more like we
know that's happening money that we at
the very least we should be spending it
on ourselves if we have it if we don't
have it we shouldn't be spending it
so
yeah
that looks like a lot of awareness but
Elon Musk uh saw the art saw a little
video of Mitch McConnell saying funding
ukrainians are number one priority and
Musk
tweets Mitch lost his marbles
and that he follows up with
uh a post let's call it the post
in which he says in all seriousness
why are we letting somebody who's having
aneurysms in public make decisions for
the country
I'm paraphrasing but that's what he said
I love the fact that musk is in this
privileged position where nobody's going
to kick him off of his own platform
he's the only person who has something
close to free speech
as because he owns the platform that
does the speaking if you don't own it
you're not really guaranteed any free
speech are you but he has it
so apparently the cost of free speech is
22 billion dollars
so that's what it takes to buy free
speech 22 billion dollars and what will
happen if you have your free speech well
apparently the government will Target
you and try to destroy your businesses
because that's what's happening the
government is trying to destroy him
because he spent 22 billion dollars to
have free speech for himself you know
ideally for us too but it works better
for him
because I can still get kicked off of
the platform but he can't
that's not gonna happen
so that's happening
all right
Governor Newsom still making news even
though there was a republican debate I
guess he got in the mix there to uh
cause some trouble and get some news
but he was asked the question by Joel
Pollock for Breitbart News and let me
let me read how this exchange went
now in case you wondered if Newsom was a
a good politician he is he's very
capable and B the slimiest slipperiest
human you've ever seen in your life
I believe that he can actually
um he can actually grease his own hair
with the things that come out of his
mouth
I I imagine him in the morning he wakes
up and his hair is all you know
cattywampus it's like this and then he
stands in front of a mirror
and he and he says just Democrat stuff
ah
um president Trump is basically like
Hitler
uh Mega make it all bunch of white
supremacists
looking good looking good
yeah that's how I imagine I imagine he
he actually slicks back his own hair
with the coming out of his
mouth
it's my best guess
I don't know for sure I'm just guessing
but
feels like it now you judge for yourself
so as
as uh Joel Pollock was talking to him
um so this is Breitbart News says why
should parents not know if their kids
are transitioning at school
is that a good question
or is that a gotcha question is that a
gotcha question
no no it's not a gotcha question it's
like directly on point to what a whole
bunch of people care about
how does uh Newsome answer that
it's a hell of a thing you're talking
about one percent of the population
climate change that's gonna that's gonna
impact 100 of the population wasn't even
brought up meaning at the debate wasn't
even brought up and we're talking about
trans issues
Breitbart News here in California this
is an issue you know his own state
California
and some other reporter chimed in said
it's a big issue for parents
Newsome says
this is a front and center issue to
America
Breitbart News
instead of going for his question uh
cleverly just restates the question why
should parents not know
which is getting back to the basic
question why should parents not know
about their kids transitioning Newsome
says it's the great uh it's the great
distraction this is one of the greatest
distractions and is classic one percent
of the population of the United States
these kids just want to live
and he sold that the last part that's
why I'm selling it these kids just want
to live
now who who else said that
they just want to live
Dr Frankenstein yeah or Dr Frankenstein
depending which movie you watched
live
it's very similar
and then
Bray bar news says
again restating the question that he
avoided
why can't parents know
Newsom the kids just want to live
and we're having a debate about trans
issues at the Reagan Library
you ought to be ashamed
and so
once he delivered his kill shot
that you cannot say political things at
the Reagan library because that would be
the worst place to say political stuff
during a political debate
it was a political debate and a lot of
it was on topics like this
but uh yeah at the Reagan Library you
should be ashamed
now I like to look at successful
politicians and try to pick up
techniques that I can incorporate into
my own life and this was a good one so
at the Reagan Library you ought to be
ashamed
and I think you could use this technique
whether you're at the Reagan library or
anywhere else
so let's say you go to uh Costco
and you want to you know you want to get
some Goods and you start walking past
the cash register without paying and uh
cashier says hey hey you know you need
to pay for that
and you turn around and you look at them
and you say
at Costco
you should be ashamed of yourself the
kids just want to live they won't live
and then just walk right out
that's how I plan
well there was a republican debate I'm
sure you all watched every minute of it
um what exactly happened that the
Republican debate well
lots of various and miscellaneous things
so we're looking for the breakout
moments
breakout moments Chris Christie gave a
long answer which apparently was
intended for one purpose only that the
closing line could be his his Trump kill
shot oh he went hard he went hard
he actually said that if Trump keeps
avoiding debating a way for it wait for
it this is devastating wait for it if
Trump continues to avoid
debating that he won't be called Donald
Trump anymore wait for it he'll be
called
Donald Duck
dagger
he stuck the dagger into Donald Trump
so I haven't heard the news if Trump has
dropped out of the race yet but one can
predict that with that kind of a
devastating labeling I don't know how
he's going to survive
well
where did Chris Christie get this clever
clever idea
was it because Hillary Clinton first
invented the nickname
during the 2016 election
or was it because when I wrote about
her coming up with the terrible nickname
in my book win bigly I mocked it for a
half a chapter
going to be that it was so well mocked
that he thought well this would be the
time to whip that out because it worked
so well for Hillary Clinton
I think I'll do that but the worst part
about it was the look on his face when
he delivered it
they'll look like he was pretty sure he
he really made a moment
so yeah you have to play it back and
watch the look at his face when he
delivers it they'll call you Donald Duck
and he was waiting for the giant
Applause that was like
so not really the the moment he was
expecting but did the news pick it up
and report it like it was a moment yes
yeah
that's how boring the debate was the
debate was so boring that that actually
made the news
just like he planned
now unfortunately it made the news for
being a stupid thing but at least you
made the news
I will talk about all the players uh
Vivek
um yeah
so Vivek
let me give you my overall and then
we'll talk about some specific things I
thought he disappeared a little bit
did anybody else have that impression
the Vivek disappeared a little bit
did you didn't seem like the big winner
um so that and that was just sort of a
feeling right it has nothing to do with
how the final outcome will be because I
don't think the debate settled anything
but I thought he
pulled back a little bit
still
is worth noting he made the biggest news
I think he made the biggest news of real
news you know not the gotcha stuff
so here are some of the things that he
said
um
he said transgenderism especially in
kids as a mental health disorder
has anybody said that directly who was
running for president
has anybody ever said that directly
like I don't remember if anybody has
can you give me a fact check
now
I am not a doctor I'm not an expert on
this topic
so I feel like it's a little bit of word
thinking a little bit of trying to win
by a definition
because I don't know
well it what makes something a mental
health disorder versus something you're
just thinking what would be the dividing
line between thinking differently
and having a mental health disorder
would it be how much it affects your
life
isn't that the standard the standard
would be how much it affects your life
right
so if everyone who has the same is in
the same situation
uh their life is affected
um is that a mental disorder
and would it be fair to say that it's a
mental disorder
if your body and your brain are just not
matched
what if your body your brain are just
not matched is that a disorder
or is that just bad luck
I feel like as soon as you put a word on
it you're changing how people think
about it and that doesn't seem fair
so I'm going to defend the uh
transgender Community a little bit by
saying I don't think every situation is
the same
I feel like that's too far
a little too far
but if you said do you think anybody who
says they are trans transgender is
primarily working off of a mental
disorder I would say yeah obviously to
me it's obvious there's some percentage
of transgender I'll talk about the
adults children are a whole different
topic but if you talk about the adults
some percentage of them are clearly just
having a mental disorder I just don't
know what percentage
if it's 99 then Vivek is basically right
if it's 50 percent
then I think that's a little harsh
and I don't know I know I'm a little
uncomfortable with a political figure
having a medical opinion
a little uncomfortable with that
but he made news and he probably
delighted his base so from a political
perspective was it wrong I don't know
I don't know I I think the
if you say to yourself well Scotty only
lost the transgenders and they're not
enough of them and they weren't going to
vote for him anyway
I would say you're wrong because there
are so many people who would support
that community and might in fact change
their vote based on that
because certainly there are Republicans
who have transgender family members so I
feel like
I feel like that might have been
something that lost him more votes than
it gained no way to know he has good
instincts and he could be entirely right
about this right right in terms of
working politically I'm not talking
about his medical opinion
but this one's tough but I do like the
fact that it was bold
I do like the fact that he was clear
about it and I do like the fact that you
know he separates the the children
policy from the adult policy and he's
still you know adults let adults do what
they want to do if it's not bothering
you so
I do like the boldness
I like the boldness not sure it's where
I would have been bold but I like the
fact he's bold
um
when questioned about he is this is the
weirdest thing about the night if you
didn't notice the debate was sponsored
by Tick Tock did you notice that
now I don't know how many other
sponsors there were commercials but at
least some of the commercials were Tick
Tock commercials
all right so in that context
um
I think Nikki Haley was mocking him
Vivek for using Tick Tock for his
political message and Vivek has a good
line he says uh he wants to try
something you know unique for
Republicans which is winning elections
it's a good life
says exactly what he wants it to say and
you know you understand it immediately
so I get it he's being strategic
and then he does say that Tick Tock and
other other addictive platforms should
not be available before age 16.
would that include video games
because video games are all addictive
and they're not good for you are they
would he ban all video games before 16.
no if your standard is that it's
addictive you get a problem if your
standard is that it's addictive and
another country controls it
then I'm all on board with that you
don't want your Nemesis to have control
of your minds
but if some video game made in America
as control of your mind by wasting your
time that might be different but they're
both addictive
so maybe that needs a extra
clarification on his band before 16.
he's in the right direction on that
um
however I should say that Nikki Haley
says directly Tick Tock should be banned
in the United States
and I prefer that view over the Vex like
a lot I prefer it a lot and she says it
directly and without any hesitation just
ban it that's the clearest rightest
statement about Tick Tock however when
Nikki hilley says why you should ban it
she uses the propaganda reason
that it's because data security
so even though she wants to ban it she
can't tell you why in an accurate way
which is very distressing
that you could be running for president
and not know that the risk of tick tock
is the influence way more than the data
I mean the data is an issue but it's
maybe on a scale of one to ten the data
is like a one most of that data you can
buy in the free market and the risk of
persuasion is a 10. it's actually you
know the persuasion could eliminate
reproduction in the United States and
get it below that survival level which
it looks like it's doing by the way that
looks like exactly what's happening
so everybody lost on Tick Tock so I'd
say everybody was a loser on that topic
also called for an end of Birthright
citizenship so that's the thing where if
somebody is not a citizen but they can
get to the United States illegally and
their kid is born here the kid is a
citizen even when the parents are not
now he didn't specify
but I assume that would not be
retroactive because I would not be on
board with somebody who's a 25 year old
citizen of the United States being told
suddenly that they're not
right now he didn't specify
so I'm sure he doesn't mean
retroactively because that would be evil
on a level that I couldn't even imagine
I mean that would just be pure evil to
take somebody's solution away from them
after they already have it
now that is pure evil so I don't think
that's what he has in mind you should
specify because if he said going forward
from this point on
strong argument strong argument because
the argument for it was based on trying
to do something that made sense for
slaves freed slaves so that they would
be citizens for sure especially if they
were born here and
it doesn't really apply to Illegal
immigration it was never meant for that
and so it probably wouldn't be that hard
to you know do an executive order and
change it and maybe maybe it would
survive the Supreme Court I think it
might
so that's another bold thing from Vivek
so he's got two two bold things
and uh boldness usually is a good play
so he has a lot of good instincts all
right let's talk about Nikki Haley in my
opinion she won the debate
but anybody want to tell me who they
think won I think Nikki Haley won I'll
tell you why in a moment
but let me see your let me see your
tanks
yeah we could say a trump one
um yeah we get it we get it Trump one
got it got it
like Tim Scott no winners DeSantis Vivek
yeah I think everybody liked their uh
favorites but let me tell you what
I did like
uh I thought Nikki Haley's presentation
was really sharp meaning that she looked
powerful
and presidential
and oh my God whoever dressed her
whoever dressed her like I don't know if
she had help
picky her I guess it looked like a dress
but you only saw the top
perfect
she looked really really good and
presidential at the same time which is
tough I mean Hillary Clinton never once
pulled off looking presidential and also
stylish
never once not a single time did she
pull that off
but Nikki Haley did
she looked female presidential sold it
totally sold the look now if you think
the look doesn't matter
of course it does
yeah we're totally influenced by the
look in fact I might be influenced by
the look right now she just looked
really professional
nailed it all right but things I liked
were her Tick Tock band I liked it even
though she doesn't understand why
she said she'd use special forces to
take out the cartels I think that's the
cleanest answer on the cartels
both DeSantis DeSantis says he would
militarize the border which is the wrong
answer
because it still puts the military on
our side of the Border
Vivek says he would use the military
against the cartels but when people hear
that they imagine a proper military
invasion of Mexico
that's not what he has in mind
we're not talking about marching the
Army across the border you know
necessarily
when when Nikki Haley talks about it she
says I'll use special forces to go after
the cartels now when you say that I have
a perfect picture in my head oh I get it
you're not necessarily going to ask for
permission
because in Special Forces they work in
secret and you're going to go directly
after the leadership of the cartels and
try to have the the least amount of you
know innocent deaths
and you're going to put the same
pressure on the cartels as they're
putting out in the country
I like
yeah saying you're going to send special
forces in is a clean clear smart way to
say it I think it's a vague's way might
actually be what he has in mind you know
more of a general military I don't know
but he needs to clarify are you really
talking about moving the the Army across
the border
if he is just say so because I don't
mind the boldness at all
but say so
all right
um maybe he has I've never heard it so
I'm sure he's been asked that question
so there might be a clarification out
there that I'm not aware of
uh one of the things that Nikki Haley
said to
have fake was I think it might have been
on the discussion about The Tick Tock
she said every time I hear you I feel a
little bit Dumber
wow now I think it was because his Tick
Tock answer didn't seem coherent or at
least that's how she was gonna she was
gonna frame it as incoherent
is coherent it is coherent but you can
make the case that he's being
inconsistent
um
I I thought that was a memorable line
it did seem rude and a little too much
and maybe somebody said oh
you know women shouldn't be so nasty
because you're sexist
I know
yeah
so maybe our prejudices are guiding us
on that one
um I thought DeSantis
was totally solid would you agree with
that answer
DeSantis was solid
didn't he didn't hurt himself may have
helped himself he might have I thought
he was better than the first one
but he had a few high points one was
I couldn't even believe this happened
but Dana Perino one of the three hosts
uh asked the group to write down on a
piece of paper and then show it at the
same time who they think should be voted
off the stage
now that might be the worst cringy thing
I've ever seen in a debate now I'm gonna
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say
there's no way in the world that Dana
Perino came up with that idea on her own
I will go further and say there's no way
in the world she didn't push back
you know to not do it I will go further
I'm not a mind reader but common sense
I will go further and say she must have
been forced
she must have been forced by producers
or bosses because it would make a moment
it would make a TV moment that's good
for uh good for good for replay you know
and make a good viral clip we talk about
it all day long
do you think that David Perino was in
favor of that
if you've watched her I don't think so I
think she was under duress
and how did it go
well it went the way it should have gone
the first adult in the room said no and
that was DeSantis this is the second
time DeSantis has immediately stopped
stupidity at a debate second time in a
row he says nope nope I'm not going to
do the thing where we all raise our
hands why don't we just answer the
question instead of fall into the gotcha
perfect and I called him out the first
time you did it the second time he does
it makes me want to be in a meeting with
him
can you imagine being in the room with
him
somebody starts talking their
and you just let them go normally oh God
is this ever going to stop stop it stop
your talking I want to talk you know but
I feel like DeSantis would just say no
you're done
yeah he looks like he doesn't take
 like if there's one thing he's
presenting best of all that what he did
in Florida was not take the
and then he gets on stage and there's
some more who stopped it first
DeSantis you stopped it first the others
just sort of oh yeah we agree with that
both times twice in a row he stopped the
 as soon as he smelled it he
didn't wait to see it
he just smelled it he's like nope nope
that's
so a plus plus
for DeSantis being the one to me that
was the moment to me that's that was the
only moment I learned something right
the other gotcha moments are about oh
Chris Christie had somebody write him a
joke that they stole from the Democrats
it's not really a moment
right but DeSantis showed you who he is
that was what you were tuning in for you
didn't want to hear their clever answers
you wanted to know who are these people
like you know under the hood
the the rapidity you know the speed with
which DeSantis shut that down
that tells you number one he's the boss
in the room even when he's not the boss
in the room
this is one of the reframes in my book
by the way one of the reframes in my
book
um reframe your brain
is exactly that
that sometimes we think we're not in
charge because there's somebody in
charge there's a host well the host is
in charge or there's a boss well the
boss is in charge you always think
somebody's in charge but not DeSantis
and I I teach you this and reframing
your brain the best idea is always in
charge
let me say it again
the person with the best idea
is always in charge no matter what the
structure is because if other people
recognize it as the best idea they will
do that
so when Dana Perino mentioned you know
doing this thing you vote off the island
the best idea came from DeSantis
the idea of doing in the first place bad
idea the idea of going along with it bad
idea the idea of shutting that down
right away
and showing some respect for the people
and by the way and then he sold it by
saying it would be disrespectful
perfect
to me this was the only useful part of
the entire event was to watch him shut
that down
now I'm not saying that the others
wouldn't have
but he beat them
he got there first and it's the second
time
the second time you got to pay attention
the first time maybe he got lucky you
know maybe it was just Instinct got
lucky the second time
yeah this is the second time you saw
some character so I'm very
um
I'm quite impressed by desantis's
performance
right um let's see what else happened
um
the way CNN covered it was have you ever
seen it on YouTube they have reaction
videos
there'll be somebody often the one of
the most common forms is will be a young
person might be a young black person who
is listening to some old white music
from the 70s that was awesome let's say
Led Zeppelin or something and it's the
first time they've heard it and then you
watch you watch it not for the music you
watching it to watch the face of the
person who's you know experiencing
something amazing and they're like
you know and it's just fun to watch the
reaction
CNN has become a reaction video
so I would like to model how they
covered Mike Pence saying they had been
sleeping with a teacher for 30 years
what he meant was his wife is a teacher
now I think everybody got that
but this was the they cut to the CNN
host I forget who she was and she's just
like oh
and if you watch Jake Tapper
you know interviewing anybody who
doesn't like he does the the Tapper tilt
you know to show you that the news is
the reaction
so once you once you realize the CNN is
not about the news it's just reaction
video they'll just show you a video that
everybody has access to it's not even
it's not even CNN's own video most of
the time it's just that was something
everybody has access to like YouTube and
then they'll just show what the faces of
the people will look like
you know around the table
now you're going to enjoy CNN so much
more
when you start to think of it as a
reaction video
just watch next time you see it you're
going to laugh out loud you go there it
is that's a reaction video the news is
the reaction
am I right
if you watch CNN they try to make the
news how they react not the news
true
once you see it you can't unsee it
all right well
um if you're looking at the uh we'll
talk about Trump's legal problems again
so the judge has ruled
that Mar-A-Lago might be worth closer to
18 million dollars and that's one of the
main pieces of evidence to show that
Trump is a big old liar because he had
apparently told Banks I guess that it
was worth a lot more
and
what is the actual estimate well the
news is finally doing something that the
news should do which is tell you what
the actual worth of Mar-A-Lago is now
it's highly subjective but if you just
look at other properties right along the
same area
smaller ones could be worth well over
100 million smaller ones worth way less
so one estimate is 300 million
from somebody who actually knows real
estate
the lowest would be like 150 but 300 is
probably reasonably reasonably good
now what do you what do you make of a
judge who rules that the thing that
Mar-A-Lago is worth maybe 18 million
when it couldn't possibly be true
and you know that the judge has to know
that because nobody would be so dumb
that they don't know that I mean I don't
know real estate but I immediately
looked at that number and said well I've
seen photographs of Mar-A-Lago from the
air there's no way that's 18
million dollars
there's just no way you don't have to be
an expert in anything to know that they
missed it by a factor of 10 or 20 or 30
or something
so
as Mike cernovich points out the
we might expect that judges from now on
will simply lie to convict people that
are their political enemies and that
they will do it in public right in front
of you like they are with Trump this is
in public
we all watched the Trump we all watched
the judge
effectively lie
now I can't read his mind so there's
still the possibility he's stupid
or had been misled in some weird way
but it sure looks like he lied
it looks like he had always meant to get
Trump and then did and I believe there's
some history of anti-trump statements
before this from the judge so
um I'm gonna I'm gonna add on to Mike
servich's view that the rule of law
basically doesn't exist for Republicans
if you have a Democrat judge and
prosecutor it really isn't going to
matter what the facts are and I think
January 6 proved that
you want a little more evidence
um do you remember the lectern guy
the guy who stole the lectern
um
well the so here's the lectoon guy who
was wandering around in January 6 and
stole the lectern
um he got uh
he had to wear an ankle monitor he was
drug tested at random he had to
surrender his passports and he was
restricted to Middle District of Florida
and given a nightly curfew
a nightly curfew
what
how does a nightly curfew have
like anything to do with anything
all right
however the person who prosecuted him
the prosecutor uh recently was arrested
himself for stabbing a man repeatedly in
public
that's right
the guy who wandered around got a pretty
pretty weird and strange sentence
because he took a lectern
and the guy who prosecuted him stabbed
somebody allegedly stabbed somebody
repeatedly in public
so
do you think the guy who stabbed
somebody repeatedly in public if he gets
a Democrat judge
is he going to get a hard sentence or
will he be released
I don't know
makes you wonder doesn't it but let's
get back to this rule of law situation
as I've said before and I think it Bears
repeating
if the entire National media with the
exception of you know Fox News and
breitbarton a few people if the main
major media is saying that Trump is
Hitler
what do you expect to happen
there's only one way that can go which
is that Trump and his supporters will be
abused in every way that you can abuse
somebody whether it's legal or not
because when it comes to killing Hitler
there are no rules
there's no law that stops you from
killing Hitler
you know that you're not going to let
the law stop you from doing something
that would damage Hillary
so the law simply doesn't matter
if it's a republican who is Trump or
supports Trump and you can see that very
clearly that there is no there's no will
to obey the law where Trump is involved
and that makes sense
I'd love to tell you it's nonsensical
but it's not
if you had been brainwashed to believe
that you know the threat to the country
and you're all going to be in I don't
know
camps or something of course you would
act violently
wouldn't you
and you would do everything you could to
thwart these this evil
so
I would not expect that we have anything
that I would call a legitimate
legal system when it comes to
Trump supporters
would you agree
that we literally in this country we
don't have a credible legal system at
the moment for this group of people now
it's not the first time is it
you could go back in history you know
however many years you want to do it and
wouldn't you say
and you would be right
that if you were black
and the legal system got a hold of you
you are right
and wasn't it because people had an idea
in their mind
about black people
and it was the idea in their mind that
made them completely ignore the basic
standards of Justice
and they probably thought they weren't
even doing anything bad
because they've been you know socialized
I guess to think that this was somehow
good for the world or something I
suppose but we we just now have a
different victim class in which the
general public thinks that ignoring the
law to get these guys would be a
reasonable choice
just like they might have thought about
Black Americans 100 years ago
or fewer fewer years ago
so I started looking around for a
country that I could move to for Asylum
and no I'm not joking I want to make
clear this is not a joke
I think I'm close to the point where I
need a backup plan
as in a country where I won't be
arrested for because I feel
like I'm at risk of getting arrested for
anything
it doesn't for anything you know nothing
real but
anything
now it would it would be a last you know
the last resort right so we're not quite
there but you can see all the all the
elements starting to come together
where a normal American would think that
I should go to jail
for my opinions
we're very close to where somebody would
want me literally in jail
for my opinions
I think we're right on the edge of that
now I very much want to live in the
United States
it's my first choice I am American Above
All right but there is a self-defense
element to this that's real
and situational awareness requires that
you have a backup plan every time you
walk into a room all right we've talked
about this have we not if you're male
every new room you walk into you
evaluate for you know entry and exits
and threats
but I'm doing that with
the United States
and so people recommended let's see
Iceland Hungary Switzerland Portugal
Sweden or Poland
Costa Rica too
but it's really tough to figure out a
new country to go to because here are
the things that are positive about the
United States number one at least in my
state wheat is legal
kind of matters to me
I don't want to have to change my
lifestyle that much right and I don't
want to be doing something illegal in
another country that's just a bad play
number two I like living in a country
that has the strongest military
because I think there's the the smallest
chance of invasion
there is some chance of a nuclear war
but everybody's dead if that happens
so I like I like being in the country
that's got the the most badass military
even when we misuse them yeah even if we
do it wrong I'd still rather be here and
the other thing is uh susceptibility to
and recovery from natural disasters
I think the United States is probably
still the top maybe Japan's pretty
awesome too but among the top in
disaster recovery
I think we'd be among the top and there
are always disasters
you know there's always a rogue
hurricane or a earthquake or something
so I do like living where there there's
a better chance of surviving a major
calamity
and I like the weather
one of the reasons I live where I live
is that I very carefully determined
where you would most likely die
from reasons that were not your own
yeah things you didn't cause on your own
so the reason I live where I live is
that it would be almost impossible to
die from being too cold or too hot
right because if it's too hot I could go
take a nap in the shade I'd probably be
fine
drink a lot of water on the hottest day
on the coldest day I could probably
start a fire you know and keep myself
warm until I figured it out put it on a
jacket like you're not going to die in
Northern California on a cold day
so I don't want to go somewhere where if
the heat goes out I'll just die
the the scariest thing in the world to
me is to be in a winter Zone
and you've got this one little
electrical line that runs to your cabin
or wherever you are and it's that one
little electrical line goes down well
you might die like to be that scary
so I picked a place that has almost no
chance of
earthquake because I'm not near any
earthquake zones I built a house that is
specifically the highest earthquake
standard and I've literally never even
felt one I mean there have been a whole
bunch of earthquakes in the general area
I live I haven't felt a single one house
doesn't move
I built a house with a Spanish
architecture because it would be the the
least burnable
right I've got tiles in the house and
I've got I got a lot of things set up
that would be hard to even get an ember
to get inside
now nothing is nothing's completely
fireproof so I can't say it's fire proof
but it was built from the ground up to
survive a fire if the entire
neighborhood burned down it was built
that way
uh it was also built
um
so it would run itself
even if I ran out of money
like it doesn't really require too much
in maintenance
you know I wouldn't need uh Heating and
Cooling if you know if I had to live
there without it I could for an extended
period of time and then I also have a
swimming pool
so I'm not going to run out of water
right away
so everything about my house I mean I'd
have to boil it or something but but I
wouldn't run out
and
so everything about my house is is you
know sort of uh planning for big
problems oh I'm also at High Ground
so I have no risk of floods no no flood
could get me where I am
so and there's no typically no
hurricanes
so I did pick what I think is the safest
part of the country for my lifestyle as
well as
disasters
it's one reason I have a swimming pool
that legitimately is one reason
that that is not
that is not a joke I might have one just
because I like swimming or I like how it
looks so that might be a full reason but
I absolutely was thinking about it in
the emergency sense very much so
all right
um
so we are at a lawless situation
um I've talked about the national
incompetence crisis and do you all agree
that there is a national incompetence
crisis that you can't really even get
simple things done
you've all seen it right now I'm kind of
fascinated about the cause of it
um one cause is that everything's too
complicated if you call for any kind of
technical support you're probably
calling with a problem they've never
even heard of before because
everything's just complicated so that's
a big part of it just everything's
complicated
but the other part of it is the story we
heard
the other day now before I tell you this
story
let me say as clearly as possible this
has nothing to do with anybody's genes
or their chromosomes or even their
culture
so there's nothing about genes
chromosomes or culture in what I'm going
to say
after George Floyd we know now from
Bloomberg that only six percent of new
jobs at the Fortune 100 went to white
people
94 went to non-white people
now of course they were trying to boost
their diversity to try to correct for
lack of diversity up to that point
now
I'm going to say
that that probably caused a wave of
incompetence like we've never seen
before and has nothing to do with
anybody's color
has nothing to do with anybody's genes
has nothing to do with their culture
has nothing to do that this is math if
you said from this day on the only place
you can hire people from is the state of
Delaware
how good would your Workforce be if you
could no longer pick from the entire
country
but you had to get all your people from
Delaware and by the way everybody else
wanted those people from Delaware too so
there's not even enough you're not even
going to get the good Delaware people
you're gonna have to go down the list
quite far before you find a Delaware
person who's available
because everybody wants them
so logically it wouldn't matter who the
you know what the mix of people was this
as soon as the Fortune 100 decided that
they had to select in the least optimal
way
which is by demographic instead of
talent
then you were guaranteed to have a
gigantic wave of incompetence
am I wrong
and would you agree with the statement
it has nothing to do with anybody's race
this is irrelevant to the math the math
of restricting your own choices
artificially
should give you a worse outcome because
you have just fewer choices to pick from
that alone explains everything
right
I don't see anybody disagree
all right the ones who say I do not
agree I understand what you're thinking
uh there's more evidence that fauci's
bad uh
I feel like every day there's a news
story that suggests the fauci's bad
are you are you tired of them all uh
facts facts uh allegations fauci's bad
they all sound the same now
like the the one thing we're all sure of
is there's something that was going on
with that fouchy guy
I'll steal a Norm Macdonald joke
there's a Norm Macdonald joke you'll
recognize the joke but I'm repurposing
of her fauci goes like this
you know the more I learn about this
faucy guy
the more I think he might be a bad dude
yeah
Norm all right well fauci uh allegedly
went to CIA headquarters to quote
influence uh its reporting on the
origins of covid and there's a reporting
that whistleblowers say that six
analysts were offered a significant
financial incentive
to basically lie about their opinions
about where the virus came from
so is any of that true
well it's in the news so probably not
because nothing in the news is really
true so we're still in the fog of war
and this
base squirrel says Scott liked fauci in
2020. now
you're hallucinating
yeah yeah go go find where I liked fauci
I didn't dislike him
because I didn't know much about him
but bass girl is screaming in caps Scott
liked fauci no that didn't happen poor
squirrel goodbye
you are disappearing now
the fortune hoax got a lot of people
all right
um Newsome versus DeSantis so as you
know Governor Newsom is going to debate
DeSantis and now he's mocking DeSantis
for accepting the debate
this is so slimy but he's so good at
being slimy that like I have mixed
feelings about him Newsome is a great
politician
because he's so slimy
here's what he says talking about
DeSantis Newsom says the fact that he
took the bait meaning that he accepted
the the uh debate the fact that he took
the bait shows he's completely
unqualified to be pressed
and then Newsome says why is he debating
a guy who's not even running for
president
oh come on I feel like I should work for
CNN reaction come on come on seriously
seriously do you say these things in
public
and do some people say yeah that makes
sense good point does anybody have that
reaction to it ah yeah that's a good
point you tricked him into debating you
because you're not running for president
oh you're totally not no no I'm not
running for president just because the
person ahead of me who is running for
president is experiencing rigor mortis
while he's alive no I'm not even
thinking about it so so unlikely so
terribly unlikely that I'd never be
running for what was the name of it
president did you say yeah no I yeah
it's just so funny to watch him weasel
through it
or as I'd like to say
the fact that he took debate shows he's
completely unqualified to be president
why is he debating the guy who's not
even running for president
[Music]
yeah that's viral
there's your viral moment right there
all right that's all I got for today
anything else happen
um so uh I think I think DeSantis will
show up early for that debate
but how will Newsom show up
it's a dad joke dad joke
all right DeSantis will show up
on time
but Newsom will show up
oily oily he'll show up oily yeah
desensis is on time and newsom's oily
dad joke
oh uh
did I forget to talk about Doug burgum
I'm pretty sure they turned off his uh
microphone didn't they did his
microphone get turned off because he
kept trying to say stuff he kept yelling
that his state
uh
his State uh
produces energy
so therefore he must respond to anybody
who talks about energy
and I thought Doug no no Doug
no Doug sorry the fact that his name is
Doug and he's being ignored is just
funnier
isn't it
there's just something about the word
Doug
that doesn't you can't take him
seriously
it's like well who's running for
president well we've got Mike Pence
we've got Vivek Ramos we've got uh
DeSantis and uh
and Doug
I think Doug will be there
there's something about Doug that
doesn't look real to me have you does
anybody have that like he looks like
he's animatronics but a really good one
there's something that doesn't register
as human about him but I don't know what
it is
eyebrows
yeah
I'm sure he's a wonderful guy I don't
want to say bad things about him but
there's something about him that
registers a little different from the
way the other people register I don't
know exactly what it is
but you see it right
he's different
in a way that has nothing to do with his
policies
right
yeah little uncanny valley thing
happening I don't know what it is
it's data
all right uncanny Dougie
all right
um Nikki hilley had a pleading voice in
the debate
you know I didn't hear it this time
I usually talk about when people have a
pleading voice like you raise the taxes
do I what are we doing in Ukraine you
know that's a pleading voice
but I thought she was
maybe she even went too far into full
Karen but to me it looked uh command
voice I thought I heard Command Voice
well maybe I didn't hear every moment so
you may have heard an answer I didn't
hear
all right that's all I got for now for
you oh Tim Scott
Tim Scott barely registers to me because
for some reason I just
I just don't think he's being taken
seriously by the rest of the country
now on one hand he's completely solid
you know you might like Ukraine too much
I don't think you could put someone who
wants you praying
to be funded on the ticket with Trump
right wouldn't it be impossible to put a
you know a real Pro let's keep beating
Russia person as vice president for
Trump
so I think Tim Scott
is has taken him out of the possibility
as a vice president pick would anybody
agree with that do you think he's no
longer a possibility for vice president
because of the Ukrainian thing
I I think I think that's too far now I
think Vivek still has policies
that would at least fold into Trump
because it's easier to moderate your
opinion than it is to flip it
so if a vague might have to just you
know tweak a little bit and then he fits
right in I'm not sure you'd even want
the job he says no he doesn't want it
which is the right thing to say at this
point but uh yeah I don't see Tim Scott
having a a future in the Trump
Administration that way maybe some other
job
all right
that's all for now
I will talk to you later
