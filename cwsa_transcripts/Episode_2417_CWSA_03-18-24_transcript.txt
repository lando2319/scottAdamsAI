good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and wow
it's going to be good today going to be
changing the universe like I always do
and uh I'm going to be looking at
comments on two different devices
here soon as that's fires up
and if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand all you need is a cuper
muger glass of tanker CH ofstein a Cante
jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip it happens now
go oh so good
delightful all right let's make sure
that the locals
people comments are up and good they're
good all
right hey wh That's me delightful I
don't like to hear
me I don't know why you
do all right you might not be surprised
that the news is funny and ridiculous
today funny and ridiculous news
that's our
specialty here's a uh opening thought
for you before we get into the fun
stuff do things seem a lot different
than say four or five years ago in terms
of how we frame the
news now we understand the news to be
completely
fake and we understand all the
Ops and we see the gears of the
machine and have you noticed that when
the the bad guys were running their
hoaxes in the last cycle that we were
treating it more like oh it's a serious
thing and I think you got some of those
facts
wrong and now we treat it like
entertainment have you noticed that it's
completely different because once you
can see the entire mechanism of how they
run the hoaxes and then you know which
entities support it like it's real it's
actually just kind of funny
and we've we meaning the people who
oppose the regime's
brainwashing were having fun with it
this time it's actually hilarious and
it's driving them crazy because we're
mocking them and calling them out in
their exact technique and you're
watching the people on the left uh get
angry that we notice they're all lying
have you have you seen that yet but look
at their faces they're really mad that
everybody knows they're lying and they
don't know what to do about it so
they're getting angrier and angrier ah
ah sure well we'll talk about that more
but that that's the uh big theme for
today I'd like to start with a Babylon B
uh joke they showed a little image there
but the caption was man thoughtfully
responds to wife's nine paragraph text
about her day with a thumbs up
emoji now that was the whole
joke and but here's the better part of
the joke so the editor-in chief of the
Babylon B Kyle man he puts in the first
comment under it he says the joke is
women text a lot now I like the joke but
I laughed for 10 minutes when I saw his
explanation of the joke and I'm not
exactly sure
why I I don't know why the explanation
of the joke was funnier than the joke
because the joke itself is great it's
it's actually a great joke um but why is
the explanation of it funnier and as as
a person who writes jokes for a
living I feel like I'm seeing one I
haven't seen before which is really
weird because there are only a 100 jokes
in the world and we just you know reuse
them with different characters basically
I don't know if I've seen this one or
maybe it's a rare one or something but
what exactly is what is it that makes
that funny that he's explaining it to us
without being asked asked the joke is
women text a lot why is that funny does
anybody know I actually have no idea
like I've laughed at it over and over
again and I don't know what makes that
funny that is a damn interesting thing
if you do this for a
living anyway the uh Apple is announcing
or at least Bloomberg has a little scoop
here it looks
like the apples in talks with Google's
Gemini AI to bring Google AI onto the
iPhone now I want you to hold in your
head for a
moment do you think that Steve Jobs
would have given up on making AI within
apple and would have
just meekly use Google's AI which no
doubt will be in Google's own
phones it feels like the biggest losing
play of all
time that that they just sort of
it's like they surrendered on the key
technology of the
future now I'm sure it's a practical
decision because they decided they
couldn't compete or it wasn't cost
effective or something but it's kind of
shocking I mean to me it looks like a
complete
surrender it just doesn't seem like a
apple of old it just feels like they're
they're a cash cow and they're just
going to milk their cash as long as they
can until they go out of business
business that's what it looks like when
they're using their competitors's AI to
me now this is not a done deal so it
could change and then I saw somebody
speculating that Siri would still be the
main thing you're talking to because
it's you know already integrated with
everything but that when Siri can't
handle the question it'll pass it off to
somebody
else I would have no interest in that
product do you know why because the
first part of it the SI that I won't say
out loud again because it's triggering
all your machines
the it doesn't understand anything I
say unlike AI which usually does you can
have a conversation with AI and you know
let's say open AI chat GP it'll
understand everything you say you you
talk to SII on your phone and it'll be
like a completely different conversation
you think it's talking to somebody else
if there's any noise in the room you're
dead so that doesn't even seem like a
good idea if it worked which is
weird well here's an interesting thing
maybe it's more more interesting to me
but uh Bri AI who you might know as the
prince of fakes used the Claude 3 Opus
AI to read my book reframe your brain
the user interface for happiness and
success which you should all Buy by the
way reframe your brain is just killing
it in terms of the difference it's
making for the readers every day I'm
hearing from people uh that reframe
changed my life like every day somebody
actually tells me their life was changed
by one sentence in the book it's a
different sentence for each person but
uh they've all found a reframe that
changed their lives anyway uh so bri. a
asked it to give it three reframes to
help him with his impostor syndrome he
was having because he applied to
gazillion jobs he did get one but only
one out of you know 1,500 he applied to
or something so he was feeling that he
had impostor syndrome for the one job he
did get and wondered if he could get
some reframes and sure enough I won't go
through the reframes but um but the AI
did
accurately read my book and pull out
three reframes that are effectively in
my voice but
rewarded um that are actually
useful and so the question I ask myself
is as a creator of that material do I
get to license it or can anybody just do
what Bri did and say hey you're an app
now give me advice from that
book what why can this AI use my
material and then present
it with like as an app and I wouldn't
get paid for
that I think that's the current
situation but on the other hand if
everybody that
AI cribbed from got paid it would be an
unmanageable
situation so I'm not sure how to solve
this but we're we're right on the brink
of writing a book doesn't make any
sense because buying a book won't make
any
sense why would anybody buy my book if
they can just have it some mized by
AI right for non-fiction books it's a
real problem for a fiction book you're
reading it for the pleasure of each
sentence so the summary doesn't make a
difference but why would you write a
non-fiction book if the market value
will plunge to
zero
worldwide upon
production I mean it's not there yet
because people still have the habit of
reading books but we're probably 5 years
away from buying a book doesn't make
sense because you can just ask your
phone and it'll tell you everything that
matters in the book so what's that do to
authors I really don't know what should
happen is any AI That's using it in a
vertical way as opposed to just looking
at it as part of the context for a
larger question which I think is fair to
me fair use would be it's aware of
what's in my book and it incorporates it
in answers that's fair it's the way a
human brain works but if you're actually
taking from my book
specifically and that's the source of
your advice and it's like an app I feel
like they need to pay me for that do you
agree I mean you there there's no should
in this world is just what you can get
away with but it feels like that would
be a stable system that the author gets
some kind of taste if they're using the
work like a little
Silo anyway
well here's a shocker Putin won his
election I'll be
damned he did anybody see that coming I
don't know if the polling was suggesting
he would win but Putin wins again in his
election well thank goodness we don't
live in a country like that where your
elections are predetermined and fake am
I
right yeah thank God we don't live in a
place where you can't trust your
elections and maybe it's all
predetermined and fake I'd hate to live
in one of those countries are you with
me yeah um here's one of the reasons
that I think Putin is popular in this
country and if it had been a free and
fair election I think he probably won
would have
won
um he's pro-
Russian doesn't that
weird he's popular because he's Pro
Russia now you might like not like a lot
of things he does
because he's sort of doing Pro Russia
stuff but isn't it weird that America is
not
pro-america is isn't that kind of
striking we're literally not pro-america
I mean we're pro Ukraine we're pro
Israel we're pro migrants from every
part of the
world but we're not exactly Pro America
because if we were we'd have a big old
wall around us and we'd keep our money
and we wouldn't get it
away so maybe this is a lesson to our
politicians if the elections are rigged
anyway would it be nice if you were
pro-american at the same time now we do
have a candidate this time who's
pro-american in all likelihood our
intelligence people will have him
killed or
something or rig the election or
something anyway I have no proof that
any of that's going to happen it's just
uh pattern
recognition all right uh did you know
that the number of young people who
plann to have kids ever is at a new low
were you aware of that the number of
young people who say yeah I'm never
going to have kids is that an alltime bu
now a lot of that is financial obviously
but since when is it ever a good
Financial idea to have
children has that ever been a good idea
I mean it was easier than before but
here's what I would
suggest I believe that Tik Tok is
primarily or maybe half of that
cause I think if you go to Tik Tok you
will see uh endless videos of dinks uh
dual income no kids people saying how
awesome it is to have no children
because they can go anywhere they want
they can spend their money any way they
want and it's great and they're really
happy now do you think that that's
influential do you think that Tik Tok
is literally training Americans not to
reproduce it is it's it's probably
measurable I bet you can measure this
because all you'd have to do is say all
right people who watch Tik Tok versus
people who don't what do you feel about
having
children that's it really easy to study
do you do you wonder if Tik Tock can
turn off human reproduction in
America because I've been saying this
for some time
I've been saying publicly I don't think
you understand China now has the power
literally there's no hyperbole here to
turn off human reproduction in
America and apparently they're doing it
now are they doing it
intentionally well there's no way to
know is there how would you know it just
happens to be very compatible with their
overall Chinese goal of being the
dominant country
because their biggest problem too is
also demographic and I'm sure they'd
like to share that problem with their
biggest
rival so yes China is
literally turning off the mating
Instinct in
America anybody worried about
that is that a problem yeah it's
probably just about the biggest problem
I doubt we have a bigger problem than
that you know debt looks pretty bad I
how to solve that but the end of
reproduction or or insufficient
reproduction is definitely the end of
your country yeah so it's the most
critical thing we have to get
right and it's under direct attack by
arrival and there are some people who
say hey Free Speech Free Speech let them
go uh Elon Musk had a conversation on
Spaces about the size of his
testicles um
I think he was talking to Gad sad and uh
Gad was talking about how uh
entrepreneurs who have more testosterone
are more
successful have you ever heard of that
that the more testosterone you have the
more
risk-taking um you have and the people
who take risks um are going to fail the
most but also succeed the most they'll
have the the most wildly different um
outcomes
so Elon was asked about this and he was
joking that uh it's not just
metaphorical that you need huge balls to
be an entrepreneur you must actually
have huge balls now I don't think the
size of the balls necessarily correlate
to how much testosterone you have is
that even a thing I don't know that
that's a thing but it's pretty funny um
so apparently testosterone gives you
better outcomes for entrepreneurial
stuff now are you worried about the
falling on the falling
testosterone you should be the less
testosterone there is the less
entrepreneurship there will be so yeah
that's pretty big problem like a
existential problem yep now what does
this suggest about the differences
between male and female entrepreneurial
success well as I've said
before
everything is a reflection or a ripple
from our mating Instinct and the people
with the most testosterone probably have
the strongest mating Instinct and you'd
expect that they would become
entrepreneurs than men anyway so I I
would expect that we would never see a
situation in which uh women are as
successful as
entrepreneurs uh unless the level of
testosterone becomes even among the two
groups because it's it's just causeing
effect uh testosterone causes risky
Behavior risky Behavior causes the most
death and
destruction but also every now and then
to hit a home run so those are the you
know the big
[Music]
winds
so uh testosterone is more than a health
thing it is a economic
Force have you ever thought of it that
way have you ever thought of
testosterone as a key to your economy it
is it definitely
is all right um if you're not following
the ongoing forever stories of people
who claim that they have found uh
evidence of rigging in the 2020
election um here's the update the people
who are closest to it believe they have
the goods now now I'm not going to tell
you they have the goods because you know
my general warning to you is that 95% of
all claims at minimum it could be 100%
but at least 95% of all claims about
election rigging will be
BS which doesn't mean the election was
clean it just means that most of the
theories overwhelmingly most of them
will turn out not to be true even if
it's true most of the theories about it
will be untrue but there are people I'll
just tell you from sort of
behind the
curtain there are now people that I
consider well-informed and serious and
show the work who believe they have
proof that the 2020 election was rigged
now you haven't heard it because it's
not in the mainstream and maybe never
will be it may never make the cross the
barrier but there are serious people who
think they have the goods I can't tell
you that because I can't verify what
they're saying I have no way to verify
it but I will tell you that serious
people
are saying they have the goods we'll see
we'll see that would be the Trump third
act if it
happens well the Associated Press is uh
worried that the Germans are showing
nationalism
so yeah they're worried that Germans
like their
country okay I don't even know if I want
to say anything about that now obviously
they're tying it back to their quote
Nazi past but I don't think that
nationalism was the problem with Hitler
Am I
Wrong do does nationalism lead you
naturally to
Hiller I I don't think they're
necessarily
connected but it's funny that in today's
day and age that playing for your team
your nation is automatically considered
kerish how' that
happen probably Tick Tock anyway uh the
Biden Administration is uh looking to uh
finalize their plan to get rid of gas
engines in the United States over
time at the same time they're doing
everything they can to destroy Elon Musk
and
Tesla the same time the same time
they're trying to destroy the gas car
industry they're trying to destroy the
the biggest dominant electric car
company now you might say that's not
true they're only going after Elon Musk
okay right I'm not going to argue that
difference yeah they're they're
targeting the biggest electric car
company and all the gas all the gas car
manufacturers
do I'll tell you people
when it comes to the car industry which
is the only thing I'm talking right now
the car industry when it comes to only
the car industry and no other topic it's
going to be a blood bath but only the
blood only only regarding the economy of
cars no no no I'm not talking about
anything else blood bath of just
automobile related topics and nothing
else all right there's a new uh study
that says alcohol deaths in the US are
up 29% they're calling it excessive
alcohol use and of course that would
affect all age
groups is that enough to explain all
excess
mortality it feels like it because if
drinking if excess they're talking about
excess right people are drinking way too
much is up 29% in 5
years and then what they did was they
studied deaths that are not um obviously
directly related to alcohol so a drunk
driving death would be directly
related but now they look at uh diseases
which they know are exacerbated by
alcohol and if you look at the diseases
that would be exacerbated by
alcohol um apparently they're up so is
this the entire explanation for more
mortality excess mortality because it is
one thing that would affect all age
groups the the thing we were that was
mysterious is the excess mortality was
in all age
groups so if you had 29% more drinking
excessive drinking not just 29% you know
more people having a sip with dinner but
29% more excessive alcohol in 5
years are you telling me that wouldn't
completely
explain the excess deaths now remember
the fentanyl deaths don't have the same
quality where if you're taking Fentanyl
and you haven't died yet it doesn't have
the quality that I know of of weakening
your other organs you know the way that
being a long-term Drinker would be it
might but I haven't seen that
signal so the fenel death we can kind of
count so if it was just that it wouldn't
be affecting older people so much right
if fenel were the cause it would be a
little bit concentrated in the younger
people but if alcohol is the cause
because the excess mortality is across
all age groups that makes
sense it might actually just be
alcohol now I know you want me to say
but it could be the vaccinations and it
could
be but this one is just right in front
of you all right you don't have to do a
whole bunch of extra you know research
if this is true now of course any study
is questionable these days so I'd like
to see a confirmation that drinking
really went up that
much uh there's a new statistics says
90% of only fans users are married and
the average age is
29 90% of only fans users are
married
so uh
what's that tell
you remember I told you that
marriage by its
design uh makes the wife the sort of the
Jailer for the husband's
sexuality right so your wife is a person
who prevents you from having sex that's
the primary purpose of a wife to prevent
you from having sex now not just with
other people but necessarily because
schedules are busy and people are not
always feeling good and healthy also
with one
person so if you have a situation where
the system is to deny men the one thing
they want the most biologically a sexual
out Outlet it's one thing we want the
most biologically not intellectually but
biologically it's the one thing we want
the most and If you deny it to them with
a system which guarantees they'll have
less than they want apparently uh you
get only fans that's worth $18 billion
they're making over a billion dollars a
year and 90% of them are married exactly
like you'd expect it to be if I told you
if I described the system of
marriage as a thing that prevents men
from having sex and then I said but
there is this tool that a man could use
somewhat secretly to fill in some of the
Gap how how would that tool do you would
probably predict it would do well
yeah uh as Glennon Greenwald points out
and it's a real head Shaker for me too
that did you know that the the most
under reported story of 2023 is that uh
the courts have
proven that or the courts have decided
that it's a true thing that the Biden
White House and the
FBI uh were going after the first
amendment by coercing big Tech to censor
desent
online literally the first amendment
was violated by our government in the
most egregious grossest biggest possible
way not a trivial thing no no not a
trivial thing a direct stake in the
heart to free
speech and we just kind of let that
go you know the Twitter files and all
the reporting
we you know we all saw it it's a fact
the courts have confirmed it and uh yeah
we just moved
on how do we move on from that well the
answer is that the media is controlled
by the bad guys and they just decided
not to make a story about the fact that
they're the bad
guys apparently if you are the bad
guys you don't have to report on it and
then nobody will act on it like it it
doesn't matter uh Mike Benz was a
subject of a big New York Times hit
piece I think it was big Sunday feature
piece like right on the front of one of
the
sections and uh he reported today on X
it was so uninteresting that he forgot
to read it it was a New York Times hit
piece about himself and he knew it was
there but he like H got busy didn't look
at it went to bed that that's how
important they seem to to many of us
all right uh the funniest part of the
day is the uh bloodbath
hoax
and so let's take a Victory lap shall we
do you remember what things were like
five seven years ago when when the fake
news would do one of their plays that
was just fake news and people weren't
really up to speed on the fact that this
was even a thing so so even the people
on the right treated it like it was real
real news but just it was
wrong right we we treated the fine
people hoax like no the news has a fact
wrong and that didn't really work at all
did it because then the news would say
no we got all the facts right and then
we'd say no but the fact is wrong here's
why and then they say now we got all the
facts right and it made no Dent you
couldn't make a dent by telling telling
the news that they got facts wrong or
left something out they just said they
didn't that would be the end of it
because their people looked that their
truth as the
truth but much has changed since then
would you agree one of the biggest
things that's
changed is
that uh how do I say this with the most
humble how do I say this with the most
fake humility so it doesn't sound
obnoxious in around 2016 I came on the
scene and told you that you ignoring
persuasion as the dominant force in
politics it wasn't just a thing to talk
about now and then it's the main thing
and that everything you saw should be
seen in the persuasion
filter where are we
now and now we're there
today every one of every every person
watching and most of the people who are
you know on X we now see everything as a
persuasion play and we also see all the
gears of the
machine we know that we know that one of
the plays for example is the wrapup
smear now the r and Nancy Pelosi
actually explained it and then we got to
watch it in the wild so we all learned
what it was the wrap up smear is when
you leak something to a reporter that's
not true the reporter reports it and
then you refer to the news as your
validation that it's true so first you
give them the fake news and then you use
their reporting as your independent
check that is real but it was just your
fake news that you gave to them now
Nancy py explained that as a like common
political play but you can generalize
from that and you can see all the other
ways they use a similar thing for
example how many of you noticed on your
own that when the blood bath uh thing
came out that number one everybody
understood its a
form it's a rootar it's where they take
something out a context and then they
pretend they didn't take it in a context
to create a whole story but as soon as
they did it this time everybody yelled
it's a rupar it's a fake edit and and
they were mocked they were mocked Just
Fish ly you know what's
different we didn't mock them for the
fine people Oaks we just tried to
correct it that didn't
work but mockery oh that's working have
you notice how well it's working have
you seen how many people have backed off
the hoax
already let's see I saw uh Stephen uh
Smith say um yeah this is a hoax so Ian
Bremer who's no fan of President Trump
but tries to call balls and
Strikes he said yeah yeah it's a
hoax um I don't think Bill Mah is going
to believe it and even there's a report
that even Morning Joe backed off it when
Elon called it down as a hoax but but
morning Joe's back at it because he's
you know not a legitimate news
guy so I would say that what's different
is we've learned to
mock the the Machinery of the hoaxes
because we can see all the moving parts
so first they take it out of context
then they put it all over social media
once it's all over social media that
makes it a
story so now the story is about how all
these right-wing people are trying to
say it didn't happen take it down Contex
and stuff so now you've got a story for
the mainstream and then the mainstream
can continue lying now the way the
mainstream media lies is they have host
they have guests who lie for
them do you think that the regular news
people want to say out
loud um I believe that the blood bath
thing is not taken out of context no
they don't want to do that because we
all know that's what they're doing so
instead they'll have some crazy batshit
person come on to say that oh it's real
he really meant
it now um here's the best part this is
the most mockable part and I would like
to invite you to join me in mocking this
this actually happened in the real world
I swear to God I'm not making it up Jen
Saki and a number of other people
including George
Conway when caught turning the blood
bath thing into fake news did they say
okay you're right you us it's fake news
it's just out of context ah you got us
did they say that no they didn't they
got caught red-handed with their hands
in the cookie jar up to their
shoulders and they doubled down but
here's the funny part do you know how
they double down to say they were right
when they're obviously
wrong it goes roughly like this and it's
going to sound like I'm just making this
up this is real people this is
real they said and I'm course sort of
summarizing several of
them they said
well maybe the blood bath was only
talking about the automobile industry
but what you don't understand is the
larger pattern and it must be seen in
the larger
pattern now it gets better but just take
a moment to Delight in the fact that
they're saying we know it's a
lie but it's still true because whatever
happens after the word because is going
to be so funny that you're going
to be laughing about it for a day so we
know it's not true but it is true
because it matches the pattern of our
other
hoaxes now they don't say it that way
way they say it matches the pattern of
January
6 which was their other
hoax it also matches the pattern
of the fine people hoax of him saying
things that you shouldn't say you know
that are
divisive um let's
see so this this is how Jen saki says it
quote uh we did not miss the full
context this was not an off message
comment this is his message Jens saki
explained about the bloodbath thing uh
and it's the exact same message he wants
magga cult to hear so they're literally
saying yes it's not true but it is
true now that's
funny they're actually using their other
hoaxes is to create what is what I'm
going to name the wrapup
hoax see the the wrapup news reporting
is when you you put a fake story and you
pretend it's true but in this case they
actually know that their hoax is a hoax
and they're still selling it as a little
bit
true because it fits the pattern of
their other
hoaxes and that's happening right in
front of us
here's George
Conway so they knew they were in trouble
which you can tell in their
faces uh I'd like to give you the face
of somebody who's telling you the truth
all right now my impression of a face of
somebody telling you the
truth well it turns out that that
bloodbath thing was an a context and
when you put it in context it was
probably more about the automobiles in
the
economy see that face that's what truth
looks like now I'd like show you the
face of somebody who's lying but they
don't know that you know they're lying
yet so this is different right I'm
getting to Jen Saki and Conway but it's
lying but they still think they can get
away with it that's when the eyes go
up oh yes it's a it's a it might have
been a little bit about the car industry
but it's really eyes open it's really
about a larger pattern now that's if
they think they can get away with the
lie you're seeing a whole different
thing watch Morning Joe and janaki
videos and stuff they know they got
caught
lying so they're they're like children
who are angry they got caught lying or a
spouse who is angry they got caught
lying so look at their faces they're
tortured faces it's like but they but
they don't understand that it's really
it's not about the fact that we made up
a total lie no no they're they're on the
wrong Point why why are you on the point
about my total lie why can't you see it
in the context of all of my
lies so their faces are like they become
like a you know tortured Gollum face so
look for the tortured Gollum faces it's
hilarious so what would a lawyer
say here's George Conway what matters
now the what matters is after the point
he's sort of acknowledging without
acknowledging that the blood pathing is
a hoax so when he uses the language what
matters is he's allowing us to oh okay
well that was
hoaxy you know maybe it was hoaxy but
what really matters says the lawyer what
really matters is that Trump
consistently uses apocalyptic and
violent language in in an indiscriminate
fashion as a result of his psychopathy
and correlative authoritarian Tendencies
and because he's just playing
evil so it's part of this big pattern of
apocalyptic and violent
language so George Conway being a lawyer
tries to find some lawyerly argument
that being completely long wrong and
lying about what bloodbath man
is if really uh in a in a technical way
if you were to look at the the full
context of the
Constitution and and oh I'm in a pretzel
I'm in a pretzel I can't get
out so it's pretty
funny do you know what's
funnier oh it gets
funnier so not long after George Conway
talked about Trump using this
consistently apocalyptic and violent
language and my God he's a psychopath
and plain
evil Biden posts on
acts that Trump must be planning another
January 6 the way he's
talking you know what they call a
violent
Insurrection some would call that
consistent use of apocalyptic and
violent language
because in the last election Biden
accused him of siding with the racists
at
Charlesville now that's
funny that watching them twist when
their entire game has been
exposed is just
entertaining Am I Wrong are are let me
see let me just back up and see if my
main theme is coming through do you
understand that this is completely
different
than
2016 in 2016 we were also having fun but
it really seemed like there was just
some problem with the news coverage it
was a little bit biased or maybe they'
missed something you know maybe there
was just some her Instinct you know
couldn't figure out what was going on
but now we see the whole thing as an OP
it it's a very organized it repeats it's
the same players using the same
techniques it even has a name it's
called a
rupar because it's done so often that it
needed a name so we could refer to it
now that's
funny every time there's a rupar it's
funny all right so I would like to also
add to this that the there's a a new
force that grew since 2016 I'm going to
call them again the internet dads but
it's the independent people who have
credibility on the internet
internet and the the internet dads and
that includes the you know the the men
and women so it's not to keep this less
sexist than the sounds it's just the
credible people who uh called out the
hoax and mocked
it and we didn't have that before there
there was not before a large group of
credible people who all at once would
say nope that's not true but that
happened there was a large group of men
mostly who who said at the first
moment that's not true and that really
made it difficult Ste um
yeah that is true all right so lots of
examples of that and it's a very
positive
force and the other the other thing that
Jen saki wanted to bring in besides
saying it's uh the blood bathing
correlated with the January 6
Insurrection hoax that they created it
also created it also matches his other
hoax according to them of uh I don't
know if you call them
people so guess what they did they took
another statement in a
context where he was talking about the
criminals he was specifically talking
about the criminals I don't know if you
call them people perfectly
acceptable everybody talks like that oh
this criminal was so bad they're like a
monster normal language
they take it down of context so you
think it means all migrants and then she
used that as evidence of the pattern so
let me show you this again the pattern
is that the rupar they did about
bloodbath matches the rupar they did
about I don't know if you call them
people which is also consistent with
their long-term hoax about January 6 so
sure it's not true that any one of them
really happened but you have to look at
the fact that there are three things
that didn't happen and then you can see
the
pattern that's actually what they're
selling to us and if you don't think
that's funny well you're dead on the
inside all right let me see if I can
reboot my comments here on
locals going to refresh those bad boys
here one
moment there we go all good all right um
so mockery is the best weapon of this
election and you should use it more
that's why I'm so happy that uh that
Biden is staying in the
race if you put somebody good in the
race against trump it would be a whole
different situation but could you
imagine um the next few months with
Biden walking around like a
robot and falling apart in front of us
so did everybody see my clever uh post I
will
paraphrase um I've been seeing online a
lot of conspiracy
theorists conspiracy theorists who are
saying that uh Biden uh died a while ago
has been replaced with a body double
some say or others say an actual
robot because he walks like a
robot and he he is no smarter than chat
GPT and he hallucinates a lot of things
a lot of things he says are not true
just like AI so a lot of people are
saying oh he he's AI he's already dead
people
people uh I hate to be the one to tell
you but the technology to make a
person from a
robot with AI
you think that's here you you think that
technologist could actually make a real
looking and talking and walking
robot that you wouldn't know was a robot
and that they could pass it off as the
President of the United States in front
of
everybody my God people that kind of
Technology isn't going to be available
for
weeks
literally what I really mean is we could
do it
today now I don't think Biden is a
robot but he could
be if you think you could tell by
looking at him or by the way he
acts I say you're
wrong I say you're wrong there is
nothing he does or says that could not
be
reproduced basically today
basically you could make AI sound like
him you could make AI talk like him now
let me be a little bit careful here I'm
not saying that you could make AI
reproduce a regular
person Biden's not regular he's so
degraded at this point that he could
Mumble anything and it would just sound
like Biden all right here's my robot
impression that's doing a bad impression
of Biden that would be perfectly
good well
uh uh well Ukraine uh uh uh I love ice
cream now if he said that the news would
report he really loves ice cream and
he's passionate about
Ukraine and we're so we're so trained
that nothing he says necessarily makes
any sense that we'd be fine with it now
do you think you could make a
robot that could pretend to be
Trump not with current
technology no no because it could never
be funny the robot could never you know
be as funny as is never be as
provocative it could never be as
unexpected but could you make an AI
version of Biden right now yes all you'd
need remember also Biden's face doesn't
move right Biden's face is
frozen he's got a Frozen face how hard
is it to put Hollywood makeup on a robot
body if the if the only thing that moves
is the mouth and only one side of it he
doesn't even have a full
mouth
Trump he's got like half a mouth and his
eyes have all the expression of open or
close
you know how eyes are the you know the
window to the soul normally your eyes
are saying a lot you can see you know
passion you can see love not Biden two
modes open open like he's got
dementia where am
I oh what do I do
now or Clos like he's
eil Trump January 6 in ction it's going
to be a blood
bath right how hard is it to make that
robot the entire face is half a mouth
and two modes of eyes and then obviously
sometimes they change out the
ears you've all noticed the the photos
some photos of Biden have the earlobe
distinct and some of them are it's
connected to his
head so there are at least two robots
with a little ear difference or perhaps
they put different ears on the
robots okay I'm just joking about the
robot part but I'm not joking about the
fact that you could recreate Biden with
a robot with AI today he's just the only
person you could do it
with am I right does anybody disagree
he's just the only person you could do
it with AI is nowhere near enough to do
you know Trump or art K Jr or you know
Larry Elder or just pick anybody who was
running for president AI couldn't do
anybody else right they're all
complicated
people not Biden I could tell you what
Biden will do next
month nothing about
it can your eyes change color did
Biden's eyes change
color I I'm seeing a comment about eye
color changing
huh all
right
so that's happening
um there's a study that says 75% of
women want a they prefer a dad bod on
their guy so women don't like their guy
to be too muscular 75% of them said they
prefer sort of a little bit of meat a
little bit of a
dadbod but so we're all believing that
right we all believe
that
no yeah don't believe
that I I've even experimented with that
I've experimented you know letting
myself gain some weight but also seeing
what it looks like when it's off I I can
tell you that people respond to me
completely differently
if if my fitness is high you get a
completely different reaction from
people if you didn't know that it's
because you've never tried it you should
try getting in really good shape enough
so that other people notice it when they
meet you all right now at different
times in my life when people would meet
me it would be one of the first things
they noticed that I was in good shape
there was a an author came to my house
one day to write a h piece about me back
when I was dumb enough to let an author
spend the day with me to write a write a
book so author was going to write a book
and I was going to be part of it so he
spends the day with me and uh when he
writes about me his first his first part
of his description is uh cartoonist must
work out a
lot because that was his first
impression that was unusually fit for a
cartoonist I guess so no uh everybody
will respond to you in a better way if
you're in better shape that's male or
female and I don't believe there are any
exceptions but here's what there are
there are definitely
Liars they're definitely liars and why
would a woman say that she likes a dad
bud if maybe she doesn't well there are
a few reasons number one they might be
with a person who has a dadbot at which
point you say oh yeah that's kind I like
because you don't want to say you don't
like it it's your partner the other
thing is you might have gotten together
when you didn't have both dad bods maybe
both of you have a dad bod eventually
but maybe you got together when you
didn't and maybe that was your initial
attraction and you don't want your guide
to get too good-look because it'll leave
you how much of it is that how much of
it is the women don't want their guide
to be better looking because they are
the jailers of their sexuality and they
can't be good wardens of the jail and
keep you
nonsexual if you're looking so good that
other women are throwing themselves at
you no it's probably just to keep the
guy
from being made of I'm definitely sure
that's a thing um but on top of that I
have met women who legitimately did like
guys with a dadbot so I've I had a
friend I'm not going to name names but
you know long ago female friend who if
you were to raate her on a scale of 1 to
10 would probably be a 10
and she would tell me that she liked
guys with Dad
bods and I would say well that's funny
because the guy you're with is like
super super ripped but you like the dad
Bots even though the guy you're with is
super ripped and you know so I'm not
believing it right
but then I watched her dating history
going forward and she did literally
select men for Dad Bots she actually did
so it was
real when she was still a 10 she
selected dad bod guys it was the damnest
thing and I think she ended up marrying
one she ended up marrying a dad bod and
happily totally happily now I think in
that case that might be somebody who
doesn't want to lose
power I think that she wanted to have
the most power in the relationship and
if she was the beautiful one and he
wasn't she'd have more power you know he
he could never do better
basically so I always suspected that
that's part of the psychology all right
let's get some really provocative stuff
here uh there's another study out of
Finland that uh the more woke you are
the less happy you
are is anybody surprised that the more
woke you are the less happy are and the
more mental illness you
have no we're not surprised but do you
think that the wokeness causes your
unhappiness because it takes away maybe
your sense of uh
agency in the sense that if you think
that your problems are caused by the
environment uh there's nothing I can do
about it it's probably not good for your
health
mental but if you think that you do have
complete control over your situation
sure there might be some systemic racism
but I'll slice through that it's just
one more little problem I've overcome
then you're probably going to be happier
because you feel like it's up to you you
know you're taking charge of your life
and you're not letting the little things
bug
you so definitely there's a causation in
that direction being woke makes you less
happy but I would suggest that it mental
illness is the beginning Point more
often in other words that mentally ill
people are are
awoke and people are not mentally ill or
not what would be a good definition of
mental
illness well I'll give you one well let
me give you an example first let me give
you two
situations um I wake up every day and I
think that things are going to go better
for me than observation would suggest in
other words I'm unusually optimistic
about my own future and always have been
is that mental illness go it's an
unrealistic view of the world is it a
mental
illness it's not based on
science it's just how I
feel is it mental illness the answer is
no because has a positive effect on my
life right so the definition is does it
hurt you so you could be weird in any
one of a billion ways
because everybody is if I haven't
mentioned this everybody's
weird did you know that I I hope you're
not one of these people who still think
they're normal people and then you're
not one of them you're weird no you're
just
young that's the problem as soon as
you're older you realize everybody's
 up some people hide it better
some people's you know weirdness is more
socially acceptable but no we are all
weirdos I mean we're all weird as
right so once you get that nobody's
weird so the reason I don't judge
people uh for their
idiosyn
idiosyncracies yeah the reason I don't
judge people for being weird is that I'm
weird you're weird we're all weird and
the fact that we're weird in different
ways I don't know how to judge that I I
don't know how to I don't know how to
judge you as the bad one if we're all is
weird like how do you even rank it so I
have a a natural resistance to bigotry I
know coming from me that sounds weird
right because if you believe the if you
believe the news I'm the biggest bigot
in the country but internally I don't
have it and the reason I don't have it
is that I don't see anybody's
difference as
rankable doeses that make sense I see
the differences but I don't know how
you'd rank them now the exceptions would
be if somebody's doing something illegal
or doing something bad to me right then
I can rank that I just don't like it but
I don't rank you for being
weird that we're all
weird all right so here's my point uh in
my opinion wokeness is a form of self
harm wokeness is a form of self
harm let me give you an example I would
like to protect the borders and not let
too many people in but you know I like
immigration and I like immigrants and i'
like high quality immigrants with skills
who can add to the country and and all
that right
so I consider that good mental health
because I because I'm uh in favor of
something that's good for me and good
for you know people I love that's good
mental health but if you want 10 million
people to come through because it's good
for the 10 million people
even though you can be pretty sure it's
bad for you or statistically it could be
bad for you that's self
harm isn't
it that's self harm that's somebody
choosing the benefit of strangers over
their own
well-being I don't know how that's not
self
harm suppose you wanted to have Dei in
your business and you're
white that is something that is designed
to be good for for people who are not
you and it's designed and you know it we
all know it that you will be worse off
in the short run at least in the short
run probably in the long run but at
least in the short run it's self
harm when people say um yeah white
people are the uh
oppressors and everybody else is a
victim that's self
harm I I'm I'm the bad person harm me
it's okay okay you know I deserve it
it's all self harm so here's our big
mistake we treated wokeness like it's a
Phil philosophical opinion when it's
definitely not it is just mental illness
and we've decided that hey free speech
and then the next thing you know women
were embracing it all the self har to me
it's like
cutting wokeness and cutting are
basically the same thing it's you think
there's something wrong with and you got
to hurt yourself to feel
better
so we need to stop treating wokeness
like it's a political opinion it is
primarily mental health
problem now what about
men well it turns out that there's a a 7
to1 difference in wokeness so women
primarily are the woke ones and men are
especially young men are far more likely
to not be woke far more likely do you
know why cuz those men don't want to
hurt themselves that's why they have
good mental health you show me a teenage
boy with good mental health and I'll
show you somebody was not woke you show
me a teenage boy in bad mental health
and low testosterone and can't get laid
and he might be sing with the mentally
uh unhealthy people just because he
thinks it's a good good mating strategy
but it's all mental health this is not
like liberal versus
conservative it's just mental
health and the longer we treat it like
it's something other than cutting the
worse will be now the reason we can't
talk uh honestly and plainly about it is
or at least you can't because you
haven't been cancelled like I
have once you get as canceled as I am
free speech
baby how do you like me
now so I get to do the things you can't
do and test the room to see if it's safe
that's what I'm doing you you can tell
that right you can tell that what I'm
doing is not just content for the show
what I'm doing is a bigger
play it it's a reframe that's pretty
sticky and it could grow and I'm going
to I'm going to go into this room that
nobody's allowed in and I'm going to say
no the problem is it's mostly women who
are bat
crazy I always like to add I'm not
saying all women are bad crazy that
would be bad crazy can we agree I'm
not saying all women are badshit crazy
because if I did well that would mean
I'm bad crazy because obviously
that's not true I'm just saying that the
wokeness is coming almost entirely from
mentally ill women and the men who can't
say no so you need more men who are
willing to say you know what I will not
get laid
so that I can tell you the
truth now I don't know if it'll make any
difference in my sex life but I don't
care I don't care if if it does it does
I am I have no left to give I'm
just trying to be
useful by the way can you tell I don't
know if you can tell I am actually just
trying to help I think the country has a
serious problem and it's all because
we've framed mental health problems who
want self
harm as some kind of positive Noble
thing it's the opposite of noble it's
just medical problem yeah and again if
you're going to say am I judging them
not really not really let me be as clear
as possible a mental health problem is a
health problem I wouldn't judge you if
you had a sprained ankle I wouldn't
judge you if you had
cancer right and I'm not going to judge
you if you have a mental health problem
that causes you to cut or to commit
suicide or to take drugs because you're
trying to kill yourself or you're
looking for a reframe because you've got
impostor
syndrome am I am I judging um Brian
because he has impostor syndrome nope I
don't do that how in the world can you
rank people's different Oddities I got
plenty of
them I I don't want to rank yours
because then I'd end up ranking mine you
know what I mean or I'd give weight to
your ranking of mine as long as I live
in a world in which I can't rank you
then when I hear you rank me and say oh
that's a bad thing you did there it just
goes I just don't have a model to hold
that nope there are just differences
just differences nobody's better
nobody's worse but we do need to treat
mental illness like mental illness or we
can't be a civilization
all
right um what about Ukraine funding is
Ukraine funding uh because it's good for
America or is it a form of self
harm well that's more of a gray area but
uh Senator Michael Bennett is
threatening that there'll be a
government shutdown
unless uh there's more Aid approved to
Ukraine so in other words the American
government will stop
functioning if we don't give our money
to another country that would stop
functioning if we don't give the
money now some people said well this is
a
mistake you know you should take care of
the American government and not fund
Ukraine some
say I say it's a
win-win if we can find a way to not fund
our government and not fund
Ukraine
H I'm only being a little bit unserious
because I do think our government needs
to shut completely because it just
doesn't function it's not helping us if
the government were doing things that
made me better off I'd be like yeah keep
that government open but if you keep
them open they're going to give my money
to
Ukraine they're going to run up my debt
why do I want that they're going to
start a war if they had more
money
no
all right uh I'd like to give you the
wisdom of Mike Goodwin who who's uh he
passed away but he was my old boss at uh
Pacific Bell and he was one of the most
interesting
characters because he had a he had a way
of summarizing things better than I've
ever heard anybody summarize and he had
a voting philosophy that went like this
if it's going to cost me extra money I
vote
no and I heard that I was like come on
that is so that's like abdicating
thought clearly there are things that
are worth a little extra money right if
you got an emergency you know there's a
war I mean obviously obviously I'd say
to
him you know sometimes you just need
more
money and he would
say they already have
enough and I would say well would would
they ask asked for more if they had
enough can you tell how young I was get
guess from the story how young I was why
would they ask for more if they have
enough I would say with my idiot
brain and then he would
say they have enough if they have
different priorities they can just
change their budget
around but they could make it work if
they had
to do you know what it took for me to
completely Embrace his philosophy that
they already have
enough age that's it
experience because my job at the time
was to make budgets for um my own group
within the the phone company so I was
the budget guy for the you know larger
entity that I was
in and I would come up with a budget and
all the individual managers would say we
can't live unless we get 20% more and I
take him to my boss and everybody said
they wanted 20% more so the overall
budget was 20% more and they all had
good reasons so I took it to my boss and
I said yeah looks like it's going to be
20% more that's what you're going to
have to ask for when you ask your boss
and the boss would say nah I'll never
get that tell them to cut it
10% and I'd be like wait what no that's
not even close they need 20% more to do
the basic things you've asked them to do
they can't do the project they can't
hire the people they can't do anything
they'll basically be dead in the water
unless you give them 20% more because
that was their arguments I was just
taking forth the arguments from the
people I talked to and then the
executive looked at me and he goes tell
everybody to cut 10% and then I said
okay that's just crazy I didn't say it
that way of course but in my mind I was
thinking that I go clearly you should be
able to pick and choose like maybe this
one should be cut 20 % maybe this one
should be getting a little extra you
really should be making decisions based
on the individual
need and then the executive said to me
tell them to cut 10% it'll be
fine so I had to go back and tell all
these people the completely
illogical orders that they were all
going to cut 10% no matter what their
business was or what their needs were
how do you think that went over well it
was hard they didn't like it at all but
it wasn't you know for me it was from
the boss so they had to deal with
it and then I tracked the budget for the
year how do you think we
did under
budget that's right after all of
that we came in under budget do you know
what projects failed because we didn't
have enough
money
none they pretty much all failed for
other reasons yeah most of them failed
most things things fail so yes uh I have
learned that you don't need to give your
government more money you can just
insist that they use what they have and
they'll figure it out could they have
done that with
Ukraine probably because what would be
different if you hadn't given your
government more money for Ukraine what
would have happened they would have
negotiated a piece a long time
ago see how this works all we had to do
was not give them money and we would
have gotten a better
result not giving people money is a
really really smart thing to do in some
situations this is one of them now do I
have you know empathy for Ukraine do I
want Putin to kill them all no but I
don't think that's ever the choice I
think we're still at a point where they
could just make a deal if they wanted to
and it' be better than waiting
all right Israel's uh Netanyahu said uh
here's three things he wants he said
there won't be snap elections so despite
what Biden might want he's not going to
call elections he said that their
military will enter and control Rafa
which is what a lot of people around the
world don't want to happen because it
would be they say too much of a civilian
death toll and he says that Israel will
fight until quote total Victory total
victory means not going to just let
Hamas go back in and do what they
want so all of Hamas will be dismantled
and dead and jailed and whatever they
do and they currently uh there might be
an update on this but they were uh doing
some kind of operation at the shifa
hospital because they believe there a
bunch of Hamas leadership at the
hospital probably true all right ladies
and
gentlemen um the reason I don't give you
much opinion about Israel is that Israel
just told you what it's going to do and
then that's what they're going to do and
it doesn't matter what you think now
suppose we say let's what if we don't
give them weapons or don't sell them
weapons do you think it will stop them
no uh what if they didn't have the right
weapons for the job do you think that
would stop them no no so if we don't
give them any funding for weapons will
it make any difference to the
outcome I don't know it might make a
difference on the number of military
people that get killed and injured
versus maybe the number of
civilians but I don't know what the net
would be in terms of human life so I
don't even have a reason to believe the
extra funding would give you a better
outcome so my impulse is to not do it
now to be clear I'm completely
supportive of Israel doing what it needs
to do to defend itself and I don't take
my analysis before o October 7th so
everything you say before October 7th
I'll just nod say yep yep that's true I
just don't care because if your country
got attacked like that you would not be
looking at the Historical precedents
that led up to it and whether or not it
was a good idea and whether or not they
were
Justified you would do what you had to
do and that's what they're
doing and there's no there's no
situation in which they're going to put
up with
reconstructing Gaza with their own money
so it becomes their biggest problem
again and anybody who imagines that they
would even consider that I don't know
what planet you're on because that's not
going to happen anyway that's all I got
for today's show I'm going to say
goodbye to the all the platforms and
then I'm going to separately um close
the locals um feed but then I'm going to
open another one for the Post show that
only the subscribers get to see thanks
for joining another great coffee with
Scot and see you see you tomorrow same
place same
time
