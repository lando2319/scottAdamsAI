to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
not only the highlight of civilization
but today a turning point in
Civilization
toward the end I'm going to do a little
presentation which reframes our
conversation about race
to a high ground that is so obvious
you're going to wonder why nobody did
this before you will actually be wowed
and I'm not kidding
if you wait for the end and I'll
actually clip this off and make it a
separate clip at some point but if you
wait for the end I will blow your mind
and it will make a difference and it
will help you
stay tuned for that but we'll do the
regular news first but before that all
you need is that cup or a mug or a glass
of tanker jealous is dying the canteen
joke or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine the
end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah well if you didn't know it
this is the last day that Dilbert will
be available to the public
now the comic continues
so there'll be no break in the
production of the comic but it will
transform as of tomorrow Monday into
Dilbert Reborn
a spicier version
now I'm not going to go crazy right it's
it's not going to be x-rated Dilbert or
anything like that but I don't have any
constraints and already I'm loving
writing without constraints it's going
to be fun so if you want to see all the
things that I wanted to do in newspapers
not be not just because they're
provocative but because it's the stuff
we're talking about it's real stuff in
the real world I can finally talk about
real stuff in the real world
at work for the first time
I'm not going to be a dick about it I'm
just going to be able to talk about it
and I got more free speech than anybody
but anyway you would need a subscription
to see that stuff and lots lots more on
the locals platform
scottadams.locals.com if you're
interested in that
um did anybody watch Bill Maher on
Friday talking about Trump's political
skills
I I thought I was dreaming
oh my God
Trump uh Bill Maher
uh and I want to I want to characterize
his opinion as carefully as possible he
is not a trump supporter
just just to be clear you know he did
not suddenly become a trump supporter
but his understanding of Trump's voters
and how they and how they see him
is now right on point he he described it
in words that were unusual to hear
coming out of anybody's mouth
uh that he completely understood
what the Middle America
was feeling
and how he's offering the solution to be
their Warrior and they get it now listen
to this reframe that Bill Maher did that
ended the the presidential hopes of Ron
DeSantis
that happened
Bill Maher
reframed DeSantis out of the race you
want to hear it
okay it's so good I'm going to make you
wait for it
because it is the end of descendants I
don't think he can win after this
Bill Maher says after looking at a poll
you know there was an overwhelming
support for Trump and some poll he was
looking at
and he said here's the reframe
nobody wants the tribute band
it's over
if you have a choice of the real band or
the tribute band DeSantis is is the
version of Trump without the edge
yeah we used to use the safe Trump
if you're thinking of him as a safe
version of trump you're thinking that
makes sense I like I like a lot of the
Trump stuff but he does cause some
trouble
yeah he causes some trouble so if I
could get all the good stuff
without the bad stuff
and whoa wow I just realized that
DeSantis is exactly that he's all of the
good stuff and he really is he is all
the good stuff
um
but without all the baggage yeah yeah I
could go for that
and then the moment you hear he's the
tribute band
it's over that that's as good as low
energy Jeb I I can confidently predict
that DeSantis will not be your next
president
you can't hear that
you just can't hear that and not be
changed by it it's an instant reframe
it's one of the best I've ever seen and
that came from Bill Barr so I think Bill
Maher just got Trump elected
like actually literally
now he was a little bit surprised
it sounded that Trump's ratings were so
high
why do you think Trump's uh rating is so
high at the moment
can you think of anything that would be
happening in the news that would make
Trump look better and better every day
yeah he's been completely clear to the
January 6th stuff
he's completely exonerated it was the
one thing that even I was unwilling to
support him for not because of what he
did but because everybody thought he did
it which just made him sort of toxic
right but now the January 6th thing as
so
um now of course the left will believe
whatever they're told but the base
just listened to Tucker Carlson just
watch the new video and said oh no
Oh no you're not doing that to us again
you are not going to create another fake
narrative now that we've seen the video
uh in which we do the thing that it was
violent because some people were violent
I get it
and too many too many people but if
you're not talking about what percentage
if you're not talking about the
percentage you're not talking about
anything
right yeah was it one percent were
violent
why can't we say that why can't we say
you know one percent were violent the
rest were there for largely a different
reason to you know protest and then we
saw that uh
I'm looking at the NPCs going nuts now
the the NPCs have been activated so you
get to stuff like wrong Scott
just wrong all right T justice can only
say the things that the 4chan people put
in his head
poor guy I feel sorry for you T justice
but you're going to disappear you're
gone
all right now uh relative to the story
did you hear that uh writer Night Naomi
wolf wrote what she calls a through a
full-throated apology
to conservatives
she actually said uh I am totally sorry
I mean when you talk about a
full-throated apology you don't get one
this good
right if you want to know what a real
apology looks like
read Naomi Wolf's I tweeted as you can
find it in my my Twitter
feed that's what a full-throwned apology
looks like a complete explanation of
what she got wrong
a complete unambiguous apology with
details
damn
that's how to be a citizen
that's how to be a citizen I've told you
before that I don't judge people by
mistakes right I don't
I mean I try not to I mean it's it's
hard but that's my philosophy don't
judge people by mistakes and the reason
is that you'd hate everybody
including yourself give yourself a break
you know at least give yourself a break
you know don't judge yourself by your
mistake either judge yourself by what
you do about it
what do you do about it once you've once
you know you did it what'd you do about
it so Naomi wolf no matter what else you
want to disagree with her other opinions
blah blah I don't know I don't know if I
agree or disagree but on this on this
point A Plus
that's good citizenship
right say what you did wrong
put it out there move on with with our
respect
and what she said was
that she fell for a whole bunch of
hoaxes and then she listed them and it
was the day I'm just saying let's see
what she lists she she believed Russia
collusioned for a while found out that
was fake she believed the Hunter's
laptop was Russia disinformation
found out that was untrue she believed
the steel dossier
now she knows that was fake and she
believed the j6 Insurrection narrative
that Trump instigated it
and now she said after seeing the the
video yup Trump did not instigate that
that that was a fake narrative and
and here here's the first thing I
thought
has anybody showed her the hoax list the
one I create the shows I don't know 21
hoaxes that that Democrats have played
on the public
21 of them she found one two three four
she found four of them
well she finds out there are over 20 of
them and people say I'm under counting
because they they carry some things that
I don't count now the reason I limit
mine to 21
is that it's 21 things that are
unambiguous like there's no doubt that
that was a lie perpetrated on the public
but there are others that are probably
lies you know but I don't know for sure
so I don't include them but it's nothing
but hoaxes the news is nothing but
hoaxes when it comes to the political
stuff the other stuff is probably
reasonably accurate you know if there's
an earthquake they probably get the
right country and and the right severity
right eventually but when it's political
it's just just crazy town all the way
so
here's the context even Naomi wolf is
saying wait a minute this whole Trump
era appears to be nothing but hoaxes to
take a man out who is very popular with
his base was representing their press
preferences quite well in my opinion you
know you don't have to agree with them
but I think Trump was accurately
representing the the will of the people
he that voted for him and
and Bill Maher is saying in a
full-throated way
that Trump is a political genius
I think what he said was you that Trump
is I forget which word to use like very
good or excellent or great at politics
and he doesn't say you know he's
unusually weasily you have to hear the
language the language is what really
really got my attention because you know
how people talk about Trump usually
it goes like this well we all know Trump
is a piece of racist trash but he did
this one thing slightly good and I guess
I have to mention it but remember mostly
we hate him in these trash right
that's a normal way
a trump uh anti-trumper would talk
but watching Bill Maher talk about him
with nothing but compliments
and the compliment was
Middle America wants a set of things and
he's the only one who's strong enough
and clear enough to actually offer them
a solution and then explain it in a way
that people are convinced
and he it appeared to me
that he has developed
a a genuine respect I mean I'm reading
Minds so be careful you know if I do
that so because I'm I'm reading myself
into the story here with this is not his
opinion but what it looks like
is that he's developed a genuine respect
for Trump's skills and a genuine respect
for the fact that those skills are
directed in a productive way toward a
big part of the country that wants to
see its its priorities
taken care of
so that is amazing
it's amazing because it reminded me when
when I was on Bill Marshal the one time
I was it was uh when Trump was running
the first time if you remember uh I was
sort of the Poor Man's uh Ann Coulter
you know remember Ann Coulter I think
was one of the first to say it publicly
that Trump would win but I went on there
and said why he would win
I gave a reason I said he has he has a
set of persuasive skills that are
unparalleled
and do you do you remember
well they did laugh when I said it they
left when and Coulter said it but I was
I was giving actual reasons I think when
she said it it sounded uh unmoored for
many reasons she wasn't on board for
reasons but she didn't give her reason
right away so that made that look a
little like out of out of the box but
what I did I gave my reasons I said he
has the following techniques they
matched the best practices of persuasion
and he's going to surprise everybody
because if you bring that tool if you
bring that toolbox to the to the project
you you can do more than the people with
fewer tools it was just that simple he
just has more tools
and I remember Bill Maher just sort of
looking at me
if you remember that I don't remember if
he had a counter or an agreement I feel
like it just
he just absorbed it and then we moved on
five or six years later
the stuff coming out of Bill Maher's
mouth is what came out of my mouth when
I talked them that it's skill
it's skill
but on top of that he's he's also given
him the respect that he does in fact
represent a substantial part of the
country
and a substantial part of the country
that doesn't seem to be as batshit crazy
as some other part of the country you
know with the wokeness that he's not
terribly on board with
so
I feel like
Trump is
very close to completely redeemed
because you look at the Ukraine war and
people write whether you love or hate
Trump people say he didn't get us into a
war that's just a fact
that you can't deny the fact that he was
the least warlike president
no but nobody can deny that fact that's
just in evidence
so if if you look at the backdrop we've
got this war that's our big problem that
people don't trust uh the Democrats but
they probably would have trusted Trump a
little bit more based on his track
record right you don't have to guess
anymore what Trump would do in
international relations he does the same
thing every time he uses the the full
weight and force of the United States to
negotiate effectively that's what he
does yeah no matter what else you don't
like about him he does do that which is
pretty important all right you also look
at energy
is there anybody who thinks that Trump's
energy policy was wrong given that he
was smart enough to connect energy to
Homeland defense he he did it when he
talked about Europe he said energy is
your safety basically and now you're
giving away your safety with this
pipeline to Russia
totally right about that
so the biggest issues we have are
economics people like Republicans better
right uh the war Trump looks good and
that and then all of Trump's scandals
at least the biggest one that you
remember January 6 was fake and now we
have even Naomi wolf noticing wait a
minute this can't be a coincidence
that there are so many times that they
tried to take Trump out with a with a
fake story
so as of today Trump's odds of winning
the presidency or
really high
they're really high
they're not a hundred percent
but it's the highest it's been
in my opinion today Trump has the
highest chance of winning uh the next
election
now I wasn't saying that a week ago
I was not saying that a week ago but I
think he just took the statistical lead
might be a 60 40 situation you know 60
chance he wins the whole thing
but I wouldn't have said 60 even a few
weeks ago
all right
um there is a thing called body doubling
I think uh Fortune had an article about
it have you heard of this where it's
where somebody will just be doing work
just their their own work at their
computer and they have an app
uh a few apps I guess or you could just
use tick tock if you're just
broadcasting and all they do is sit
there and work and other people also
work while they have that on so you have
a co-worker does that sound crazy
does that sound crazy to you to have a
like a virtual quote and you don't talk
to them there's no interaction they just
sit there and you know they're there
they're working you're working
all right well it turns out that this is
like a godsend for anybody with ADHD
because apparently they've all
discovered
all meaning anybody with ADHD that they
can concentrate better if there are
other people modeling the same behavior
and I don't know if it's the modeling
that does it but if somebody else is
working then they can concentrate
if Nobody's around working then then
it's just a free-for-all in their minds
and you know their their mind is all
over but as long as there's somebody
else doing what they want to do they can
kind of mirror them and then they can
control now have I told you that um I
can't do any work in the afternoon
unless I'm at Starbucks or there's
somebody there in my house have I told
you that I actually can't do any work
after maybe 10 A.M
unless there's somebody around or
watching and it's the reason I've live
streamed some of my writing sessions for
the comic I could sit there all day and
just be distracted in the afternoon but
as soon as I turn on the live stream and
I start talking to the audience I do
this with the locals people and I'll do
a writing session where they learn they
learn writing technique and how to write
jokes and what I'm getting out of it is
the feedback in the company and it makes
a week worth of joke writing
pleasure
like that's not an exaggeration you
would expect an exaggeration in this
situation not an exaggeration it
actually transforms uh an unpleasant
work of just uh blank page what am I
going to put what am I going to put
there and it turns it into Fun
like I can't wait to do it again
and that's the difference so I believe
that I must have I must have ADHD
or or at least some cousin to it that
activates by the time I've had a few
cups of coffee
right by the afternoon I can't sit still
and listen to anything in the morning I
have great Focus so right now from like
4 a.m to 8 A.M I can focus on anything
between four and eight am
after that my mind is just displayed all
over the place it's hard to sit down and
write
so I'm going to try this I'm going to
find one of these apps and just get a
remote uh stranger
and they may be they may be surprised
who their working partner is I'm not
sure if anybody asks or if you just show
up and say hey let's get to work
but I think I'll be doing this it's
called body doubling and if you have
ADHD totally recommend it I I've heard
I've heard good things
uh let's talk about Silicon Valley bank
before I change the world with my
whiteboard presentation which you
definitely don't want to miss
so here's the background if you don't
know there's a 19th biggest bank in the
country Silicon Valley Bank has been
taken over by regulators
and the question is will depositors get
all their money back because it's only
guaranteed up to 250 000 per person for
per account or per person
no per account yeah depending on the
type of account
and
so the question is we know it looks like
we know the investors will get wiped out
but
um but
will the depositors get all their money
back because a lot of the startups had
tons of money in there they would lose
all of it
and there's a big disagreement you got
your Matt Gates Type and I think Alex
Berenson weighed in to say no
let let those people take their loss
including the depositors who had nothing
to do with anything
yeah they were totally innocent uh let
them take their loss free market why
should we bail them out Etc
and then you have other people such as
David sacks who if you're not following
you should he tends to be the adult in
the room
you know he's he's not political as much
as he is let me explain what works and
what doesn't work
he's one of those is is basically an
internet dad
of the highest level right if you want
the dad advice meaning forget the
politics what what is Smart what makes
sense follow David sacks
uh why don't you use one of the PayPal
original guys you know friends with musk
and Peter Thiel and all those guys so
any any one of them if they talk you
should listen right it's not an accident
that they were all successful
uh more than once
so here's my take on it should we save
the
depositors or should we let it let it go
because free markets blah blah blah
the first thing I would like to
recommend is because it's uh social
media
uh can we all agree
that some of us will say it's about
saving the depositors and others will
argue it has nothing to do with the
depositors we're trying to uh fix the
entire system so that it the contagion
of this one doesn't take out any other
Banks and then if we could let's pretend
it's the same conversation okay
because you want to be as stupid as you
possibly could when the fate of the
entire world is involved right if the
whole world is at stake you want to be
the stupidest getting as you can
be so I recommend that we act as though
the people talking about the depositors
are in the same conversation with the
people who are talking about the
Integrity of the entire banking system
and let's make sure we confuse those
like it like it's the same thing so that
way when I say hey this might be a good
way to protect the entire economy and
the banking system you could say some
dumb thing like about whether
the depositor should be made whole
because that's not the same conversation
but because of social media let's
 pretend it's all the same
okay and let the whole country burn
because we can't even get out of that
little mental trap
that's what's going to happen
we're not going to have we're not even
going to be able to talk about it we're
going to pretend it's the same
conversation
it's not
it's not it really isn't
if you can't separate those two you
don't belong in the conversation
and yes I did swear because I want to
make an emphasis that's the only time to
swear
swearing because you're just talking bad
idea swearing because the entire world
is at stake yeah
yeah
for that I'm going to get your attention
here's my take
the government has the ability to
protect the system
meaning that the government can say whoa
don't worry whatever we need to say is
protected is protected even if it's
different than what we said before
would you agree that the government has
the power to do that
so therefore they do have the power to
protect the banking system
and they apparently have the will and
then here's the good news here's the
good news
when something like this happens
the smart people push the stupid people
out of the way
now there'll still be plenty of stupid
people on social media confusing the
depositor question with the banking
Integrity question you can't stop that
but in the real world where people make
real decisions and they make they're
really influential
the smart people I guarantee it
are elbowing the dumb people out of the
way
all right you had your chance we're now
done with the dumb people let the smart
people play and watching this you can
almost watch it on social media start to
Bubble Up like the the smart people who
don't talk too much they just started
talking more have you noticed so
basically everybody everybody
who's looking at this situation knows
that the stupid people have to get out
of the way am I right is there anybody
who disagrees with that statement
everybody sees that on this situation
it's just too important the stupid
people got to take a pass
stupid people back up the smart people
are coming online
just as they should the system is is
entering a self-correcting mode there's
almost no chance it's going to fall
apart
so there is no chance that the whole
banking system is going to fall apart
because the government can predict it
the smart people are elbowing the dumb
people out of the way for this they will
take over they will have their way and
they will decide to protect the banking
system that's what's going to happen
so I'm not giving you any Financial
advice what you do with your money what
you need to do to be safe do what you
need to do but the smart people will
take care of it
I'm pretty sure it will be okay now
there could be some disruption some
people might lose money but the larger
banking system I believe will be
protected because we have the ability to
protect it
and now the smart people are going to
make it happen
all right speaking of smart people
um
Mark Cuban has weighed in
he said this you might recognize this
thought a couple of Silicon Valley
thoughts number one 250 000 is too low
that's the amount they guarantee it's
insane that a small company with say 2.5
million in payables and payroll at the
end of the month should be quote prudent
and split their cash across 10 banks in
case of a run the fees in admin would be
crazy but would be great for the banks
does that sound like exactly what I said
right there there's
an unfairness about the system that just
screams you know once once you need to
implement the system
the fact that you could just
inconvenience yourself
this way by by opening 10 accounts when
you only need one the fact that that
works
just tells you the system needs to be
at least reconsidered during an
emergency
it should at least be reconsidered
during something this big
so I completely agree with Mark Cuban
that the insanity of that argues against
keeping it intact when the whole system
is at stake you don't want to you don't
want to keep your insane things you want
to get rid of the insane stuff
all right
um
so there you go I think we'll be fine
but uh not until the smart people have
taken control and it looks like that's
happening this weekend uh there's a good
chance that another bank will buy it
um but apparently there's some timing
issues about how long it would take to
get improved and weather would cause too
much concentration in the banking
industry can you believe that can you
believe that one of the things people
care about is that the 19th biggest bank
might be bought with another one and
that the two of them would be you know
bigger
that feels absolutely ridiculous doesn't
it
it feels ridiculous it's like not
understanding the the cost benefit
situation at all
all right and the good news there's a
new superconducting material that has
been discovered of course it's made of
rare earth materials
because once you get excited about
anything yeah anything in technology
goes like this oh this new thing's been
invented it's going to change everything
and and what what do you need to make it
well you need some
rare earth materials
would there be any trouble getting
enough rare earth materials for this new
and I don't know rare earth materials
how hard it's going to be yeah rare
earth materials might be kind of a
problem but what they found is a new
superconducting material that works at
the higher temperatures and that
pressures that are low enough that it's
actually useful
we've had superconducting materials for
a long time
but you have to have them super Frozen
and high pressure and you can't really
do anything with that but this one will
work at higher temperatures that are
practical and at pressure that's
practical and so they're thinking that
they could make everything from a better
Fusion containment
um
whatever you call it let's just call it
fusion reaction containment because I
don't know what I'm talking about but
that sounded close
so it might make a fusion
much more practical
and it looks like Fusion was going to be
practical anyway so this could be you
know another big leap in that field that
looks like it's going in the right
direction
but also it could be used for uh
creating power networks that don't have
loss
right now we lose a ton of of energy
just sending it across lines because you
lose a lot as it goes across the line
but the superconductive stuff would lose
nothing so I could send a I could send
some energy from here to the other side
of the planet and if it was all super
conductive path
it would be the same on the other end
which is amazing
now
uh I don't see that you could build an
energy Network very quickly it seems
like that's like Beyond possible so
that's not the big thing but maybe
something like Fusion you can get there
faster because in that case building a
one-off makes sense
all right and they could build uh
hovering trains and medical devices and
all kinds of stuff so we'll see if
anything comes to that we'll see did you
see uh fauci uh lying to Jim Acosta
I'm going to say he's lying I don't know
I don't know that he's lying
but I've never seen anybody who had a
worse lie face you know what I mean
like you just look at his face you could
turn off the sound and you'd say well
based on his face he's lying
I mean just look at his face that's the
biggest liar face in the world I was
thinking if I could do an impression
I don't know if I can should I try
a fouchy live face impression
all right I'll do my best
I'll do Jim Acosta uh Dr fauci
um what about that lab leak
uh well
um Jim
um
that people don't understand that uh
what are the possibilities by the way
I'm not making this up I'm paraphrasing
but I'm not making this up yeah one of
the uh possibilities is that somebody
who worked at the lab
uh was uh out in the field looking for
viruses you know mucking around with the
bats and the bengolins and stuff and
that they got an infection
while they were out in nature
and then they took that infection
took the infection and then
and then they brought that back into the
lab where they worked and then it got
into the lab and then it got out of the
lab and so really
one of the ways that nobody talks about
is that you could have a lab leak but
really it came from nature went into the
lab leaked back into nature and that's
how it could have happened and people
don't talk about that possibility
is anybody buying this
and they he mentioned the other
possibility which is uh nobody
nobody all the experts
nobody thinks it's weaponized I mean
nobody thinks that
so but it could have been gain of
function it could have been gained a
function but it could have been the
natural way you know not manipulating a
gene but rather a natural uh you know
Evolution within a lab and in which case
that wouldn't even be manipulation
but let's say it got out of the lab that
way that would be again nature
I mean that would just be nature even
though we forced it to happen by mating
these two things in lab but still it was
natural we didn't manipulate anything
and that
scene
my Dr fauci I assumed he was lying about
all of it or covering his butt it didn't
look good
all right
um I have a question for you that I have
not seen discussed
if we think that covet can give you a
stroke and we think that vaccinations
could give you a stroke
if we think that the lockdown made you
fat and that could give you a stroke if
you think that the pandemic made you
tense and tension can give you a stroke
have we left one out
apparently everything can cause a stroke
and that's not too surprising basically
anything that puts stress on your system
well
have you heard of the huberman breathing
technique you know where you do two
inhales and followed by an exhale when
Dr huberman explains why it works
because it immediately calms you down he
says that the magic to it is that it it
Alters the uh CO2 to oxygen levels
like so it gives you sort of an optimal
uh level so if you do the two inhales
and one exhale you end up for a little
while with sort of the perfect mix of
CO2 and oxygen right now if it's true
and by the way it would actually lower
your blood pressure it's actually such a
good technique that if you did it a lot
your blood pressure would go down
sounds good
now if it's true that breathing properly
makes you healthier or at least reduce
reduces your anxiety and tension which
should make you healthier
would it not be true that if you had the
wrong mix
of CO2 and oxygen that it would be the
opposite
of the optimal mix which makes you
healthier
so could it be that breathing normal is
okay
doing Hoover bin breathing is extra
healthy but wearing a mask for long
periods of time for two years could get
you a sub-optimal mix which could cause
in the long run
Strokes and cardiac problems
now I don't know that that's true but I
also don't know why it wouldn't be true
why wouldn't it be true
it's almost like how could it not be
true
now the counter argument to that is that
hasn't been detected
the counter argument's pretty good which
is nobody's noticed or studied it so
there's no evidence for what I'm saying
I'm just saying
if it makes you healthier to have the
right mix of CO2
what does it do to have the wrong mix
and and they have studied that if you
wear a mask you do have to a higher
level of CO2 and substantial
but the argument is it doesn't hurt you
right and and some some amount of
variance in CO2 definitely wouldn't hurt
you I just don't know if the masks put
it over some level
you know if you could do that little
breathing technique and just that little
technique of two inhales and exhale if
that puts you in the right
frame for CO2 it wouldn't take much to
knock you out of that frame
so
this makes sense to me USA Today Was
super racist today
they printed they were talking about the
best and worst places to live and they
said that Maine has the lowest violent
crime rate
so that's good I mean that's the lowest
violent crime rate right below that uh
they they said to us uh however
something bad going on in Maine
I'm sorry two bad things
so the first bad thing no that's a good
thing the the good thing is that they
have low uh crime rates but the bad
thing is that they have the worst uh
diversity in the whole country they've
got 94.4 percent white residents
uh
but then coincidentally also the lowest
violent crime rate now when you put
those things two things together and
then the next thing they talked about
was Baltimore with the worst crime rate
now that's pretty racist isn't it
it's pretty racist
because they're saying uh lowest crime
rate and then right like right below it
uh and it's all white people
now when I talk about the difference
between Baltimore and some other place
that has less crime I say it's systemic
racism
you've heard me say it right how many
times have you heard me say the
difference in poverty level is systemic
racism I say it so much it's like a
mantra
all right so just I want you to hold
this in your mind
that when I talk about Baltimore
I say the cause is systemic racism
when USA Today talked about it they just
gave you the the data and let you draw
your own conclusions Maine has by far
the most white people and the lowest
crime
kind of suspiciously like they're
suggesting they're related
aren't they
but I don't say that I say it's systemic
racism
now the USA Today canceled me they
canceled Dilbert
because I say it's systemic racism
but maybe they should add a little
context
I think they should add a little context
to that it looks a little bit racist in
my mind
um but here's an interesting thing
Bruce temkin I guess he's part of that
temkin group in 2016 they did a consumer
Benchmark study to see who's happiest
then they divided by age and ethnicity
and gender and stuff here's what they
found the happiest females are over 75.
does that make sense to you that the
happiest women are the women over 75
and I and I think that uh
I think that the reason might be that
they they no longer have to worry about
man woman stuff
like all that stuff sort of out the door
at that point there's probably a lot of
pressure off
while men are happier between 65 to 74.
and I gotta tell you so that's my age
range
um if you had told me at age 30
that at age 66 I would be happier I
never would have believed that
but I'm unambiguously happier
like it's actually true
like it's so counter intuitive you would
think oh I'd like you know my young
health and my young options and stuff
like that I don't miss any of that
like I really like
my current life and apparently that's a
common thing for men and women over 75
is that when you think there would be
the least happy they're the most happy
so if you're worried about your older
years that's one one less thing to worry
about
if you're like everybody else you might
be happier
but some other interesting things
um
uh the least happy or 18 to 24 year olds
no surprise followed closely by 45 to 54
year olds
and between the ages of 18 and 44 males
are happier than females
so young adults males are happier
but females are happier older
interesting so men are happy or younger
women are happier older but as education
increases so does your happiness
so the more educated you are the more
happy you are and here's an interesting
one ethnicity it says there's little
variation in happiness across ethnic
groups Caucasians are the happiest of 73
percent but only three points above
African Americans
only three points so three points on a
survey like this would be pretty close
to the you know margin of error
probably above it but pretty close
um
and then income makes a difference too
obviously so the things that make a
difference are education
uh age and income
yeah and ethnicity doesn't make that
much difference
that's interesting
um given given the difference in
Economic Opportunity that feels like it
should be a bigger difference but since
money didn't make that much difference
uh there was about the same amount of
Happiness now here's a question for you
what is equity
what's the purpose of life
like why are we here
I would say to pursue happiness
pursue happiness
so if you and I are equally happy do we
have equity
it's our primary purpose of life
is to pursue happiness
if you're happy I'm happy we've achieved
equity
if you say oh but you also also must
have the same amount of money
then I would say well
what
what that's not the goal
where in the constitution does it say we
have the right to money
I mean it doesn't take away all right
but the Constitution literally says you
know the right to pursue happiness
like it's written right in the front of
the Constitution that's the goal
happiness right if I can make you happy
I'll try to do it if you can make me
happy please do
right so uh take my situation
my income went down around 80 percent
by being canceled
and I got happier
I got happier I'm actually creatively I
feel better than I felt in decades
because I can create the way I want all
these options have opened up I don't
have you know this thing hanging over me
I feel great which is hard to explain
because I don't think anybody believes
it but I do so money and happiness are
pretty unmoored you know and as long as
you have you know some minimum
and happiness is very similar across
ethnicities
so we're already at we already have
Equity we have equity in the thing that
matters
happiness
all right but keep this in mind that if
uh if black Americans had a better
education relative to other groups their
happiness would go up and would probably
exceed
you know exceed the Caucasian happiness
according to this and if their incomes
went up they might be a little happier
too
I would
a little bit but you know they are still
disconnected so
I'm about to give you
uh a oh and also the other thing that
creates happiness is being married
being married
right
so if there's a difference between
ethnicities and marriage rates that
would also go directly to happiness
so but where are we looking instead
we're not looking at happiness are we
the the main objective of life
we're looking at some kind of equity and
all the other stuff
I would like to give you a reframe
and I'm going to Signal where this is
beginning all right so I'm going to do
this uh in a way that
makes it obvious I'm going to create a
clip of it afterwards
so I'm going to give you a reframe that
I believe changes everything
and
it will answer everything
about race and that we're dealing with
it in the United States
so
this is a micro lesson
on race
and how to reframe it
to fix everything
for everybody and it goes like this
if you were to have a conversation about
race
it would include but not be limited to
stuff like grievances for past
discrimination you talk about critical
race Theory you talk about one group
compared to another group you'd look for
racists because you want to spot the
racist to know how to deal with that
you'd be looking at systemic racism and
you'd be looking at maybe reparations
now this is not a complete list of all
the things you'd be talking about but
it's sort of a representative list if
you're in the race conversation it'd be
this stuff now I spend most of my time
and a lot of people don't know this
a lot of people don't know this but I
spent for the past 10 years I've been
more noted for my work in personal
success
a book behind me had it filled almost
everything was the entry to that domain
for me and that became in my opinion
it's the most influential book on
personal success other books on personal
success refer to it it's the most common
way that people will give advice is
directly and the things that I came up
with in that book talking about Talent
Stacks systems over goals passion is you
know BS Etc
uh but if I'm talking about personal
success I will be talking about uh
keeping positive attitude having the
right mindset I'll be talking about
gratitude as a as a superpower
for success I talk about the individual
and how to network and have lots of
contacts I talk about keeping your
optimism up because that really helps
for success and I would talk about
reciprocity as an operating system you
do things for people they'll do things
for you maybe not directly but
eventually
now you might have already noticed
something about these two lists
that they're in conflict
for example
if you're looking at the Grievances of
the past either with CRT or
um you know just generally you're saying
that there's discrimination and you've
got to focus on the grievance part of it
that is the opposite of what somebody
would do for success
if you're focused on personal success
you'd want to have a gratitude frame but
how can you have gratitude about slavery
if you're a black American how could you
ever
think oh that slavery worked out well of
course not nobody could have that
mindset I'm not suggesting you should
have that mindset I'm saying that this
is in direct conflict with the basic
Prem the basic tools of success
but it goes deeper talking about a group
doesn't help you
at all but talking about you as an
individual and what you should do would
help you a lot
uh spotting racist is good to do you
want to be able to spot the racists and
deal with them but far more important to
success would be
open yourselves to everybody have the
most contacts you can have don't worry
so much about what their personal
thoughts are just make sure make sure
that everybody has a good opinion of you
because you've connected with them
you've done the right things you've
established your value networking big
big factor for Success optimism
almost everybody will tell you if they
work in the field of personal success
your your mindset again your happiness
your your gratitude your optimism your
own mindset things if you get these
things right you will be very successful
and then the biggest one is reciprocity
it's the opposite of reparations
reparations are you did something bad
for me I've got a grievance I would like
you to make make good on that
reciprocity says I'm going to do
something for you that you didn't ask
for and I'm going to do something for
you that you didn't ask for and you and
you just keep doing it eventually
somebody in that group is going to come
back to you and say uh all right here's
something you didn't ask for but this
could help you out let me give you a
specific example of this
um I have been refusing interviews on
the question of my little drama that
many of you know about I didn't want to
do an interview with anybody who is too
friendly to my side or my point of view
so I've been turning down everybody who
asked and there's a lot of them
until I got a request from Larry Elder
now Larry Elder
uh I imagine because he's on the
conservative side that he would say all
right this your what you're saying is
important let's talk about it maybe it
was taken out of context now I know he
will say something like that because he
wrote an article
that got a lot of play in which he
seemed to have a full understanding of
my situation that was good for me I mean
in other words if you understood the
situation you would describe it in a way
that doesn't make me look bad
so he wrote an article that was his
actual opinion I'm sure and it was a
positive for me
when Larry Elder asked me if I wanted to
be on his podcast what did I say
I said some version of damn it Larry
Elder you magnificent bastard you got me
I can't say no to that because I operate
on a reciprocity operating system
Larry Elder also operates on a
reciprocity
operating system
why did he write a good article about me
well partly because he believed it I'm
sure it's exactly what he thinks but he
might also remember that I endorsed him
for governor when he ran in the recall
election against Newsom
so I did something for him
that he didn't ask for
when I got in trouble
not a surprise he's not the only person
who emerged to do something for me just
because sometime in the past I'd done
something for them
the reciprocity operating system is
Magic
it's what gets Larry Elder successful in
part I'm sure that I'll bet you if you
asked Larry Elder just use him as an
example if you said do you believe that
this has helped you the the tools for
Success that I just described what do
you think you'd say
he would say yes and I'm not reading his
mind because everybody who has his kind
of success which is quite notable uh all
uses the same tools
and everybody who's not happy and not
doing well are focusing on the past
focusing on grievances focusing on what
somebody else owes them and focusing on
how this system is going to prevent them
from succeeding because it's all stacked
against them
and so
I propose to you
that we reframe the issue so that we
never forget the things in the race
filter that has to be part of History we
have to make sure that none of that is
left out every bit of that needs to be
taught we need to understand that I like
my black history month I like including
history you know playing in raw
but I like
teaching black Americans and white
Americans and every other kind of
Americans that if they want to succeed
it's not about their obstacles
it's about their tools for a success
if we can
if we could get people to understand
that the it's the people who make money
selling the the race filter that's why
it's on your head all the time the
reason we're all thinking about it all
the time and it permeates everything we
do is because it's monetized there are
people who make a lot of money just
selling this version of reality they're
not selling you personal success nor do
they say they are there that's not even
something that they're pretending
they're selling to you right so just
know what you're buying if you're paying
for this you're going to get something
that's a complete obstacle to personal
success
if black Americans spend a generation
working on personal success using the
tools of that they still have a lot of
obstacles right systemic racism is real
but they would slice through it like
butter and let me tell you as someone
who has hired people a number of people
you know in my life if somebody comes in
to talk to me and they exhibit an
understanding of anything on the
personal uh the personal success list
they're hired
like I don't even care about
qualifications at that point if you're
if your mindset is on the success tools
you're going to do fine that's an
employee I want if you walk in and I get
a sniff even a sniff that your mindset
is on the race filter
and you're ignoring this personal
success filter I'm sorry you are
definitely not hired
because if somebody comes in with a
mindset that every expert not just me
this isn't my personal opinion every
expert would agree with the following
statement people who focus on personal
success tools do well
people who focus on grievances do less
well
and that ladies and gentlemen is the
great reframe the most useful thing
anybody's done this year if you're
wondering why I was so provocative to
get your attention
it's because of this it's because we're
doing everything wrong and it's making
me crazy so now that I have your
attention if you could just take it away
from my personality for a moment and
just spend a little time thinking about
what do you want to teach your kids do
you want to teach them how to succeed
the way it works for everybody or do you
want to teach them that they should
focus on their Grievances and have much
less chance of of success and that is
your micro lesson on reframing race
so you can see I uh cut it off there
because we're gonna I'm gonna clip this
and make it available
this is called uh let me tell you a
little bit about the technique
so this is a reframe
but it also uses uh I suppose I should
have included this but
I'll include it for you
I've told you this before one of the
biggest uh mistakes that people make is
to say oh there's a cause of my problem
so when I go to fix that I better work
on the cause
so systemic racism caused by white
people and discrimination caused a
problem for current black Americans so
let's focus on this cause let's let's
fix this white person problem here but
that is counterproductive if you have a
better solution
so stop looking at the cause as the only
place you can find a solution
instead
look for any solution
just any solution and one solution is to
make your personal skills so good that
nobody can deny you
you just have to be the kind of person
people want to work with marry date and
hire
right so separate the solution
from the problem
and everything is solved now in my
opinion this is the most uh the most
useful thing anybody's ever said about
race in America
and you're not going to talk me out of
that it's the most useful useful
thing anybody's ever said about race in
America
let's see what happens
YouTube I'm going to say goodbye to you
talk to the locals people a little bit
more and I'll see you tomorrow
