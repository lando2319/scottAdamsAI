foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the finest program in all the land
dare I say a highlight of human
civilization I don't think it gets any
better
than coffee with Scott Adams today the
coffee will be black
the best kind and if you'd like to take
it up another level all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chalices
down that canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill me with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine to the day the
thing that makes everything better is
called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens now
in which all of us come together in
unity
go
oh yeah yeah
that's good
I'm seeing more AI art
of me over the locals platform they're
showing me art that the artificial
intelligence made usually of me
and uh I'm pretty scary looking
according to artificial intelligence
very scary looking
would you like to talk about the news
we've got some interesting news
we will talk about Kanye but we'll wait
for some more people to stream into the
live stream
um are you following the story it's a
small story
but maybe it should be a big one
and the small story is about Nexium and
Keith reneri now you all remember the
story
so the alleged story was that Keith
reneri was a cult
um occult leader this is this is the
story I'm not saying this is my
interpretation he was a cult leader and
part of that cult it was a sub cult and
in his subcult
there was a it was a sex cult
and he had he had his sex slaves branded
this is what they said
and uh I don't control them in for
various ways but then he was convicted
of
uh among other things I think sex with
an underage girl
the biggest part of the evidence of that
or a key part of the evidence was a
photograph of the underage girl on his
computer
now since the photograph had a date
and it was a picture of the girl and
clearly the photo indicated in in
context that there was
an underage thing going on
now I don't know the truth of the story
so so don't ask me to tell you what
really what what really happened I do
not know
if Keith Renee did anything wrong
or if he did what it was don't know
I will tell you that Alan dershowitz is
working on the Keith Renee defense
so that that should be a little flag
that goes up and you go what
what why would he be working on that
well let me tell you
turns out that they've produced several
ex-fbi employees and forensic experts
who all seem to say the same thing
the photograph which was key to the
prosecution was faked by the FBI
that's what it looks like
so the the forensic people say ah it's
really obvious this is totally faked
it was a key piece of the prosecution a
key piece
because it gave it basically put a date
on things I think that was the main
thing
and according to dershowitz now
dershowitz is not saying
we've proven it's faked he's still
saying alleged
which you know you should say at this
point you should say alleged but
if you see the little Snippets of the
actual experts talking about it
they're not saying probably
the the experts are not saying oh this
could be faked or maybe not
they're saying oh this is definitely
faked
oh absolutely this is just fake
now think about that
do you remember a time when you would
have said to yourself that's just that's
just what the guilty people say
that's just what any defense would say
right
you don't think that now do you
do you believe that the FBI could have
been part of a conspiracy
to convict him
what do you believe just without any
evidence you don't have any evidence you
just have some claims right all you have
are claims you don't have any evidence
you have only claims
based on the claims themselves do you
think that the FBI was part of a plot to
put him in prison
I think more likely yes than no
I think that the presumption of guilt is
on the FBI
now I've said this a number of times if
the FBI were an individual citizen let's
say one person at the FBI is being
accused
if it's one person
I'd say presumption of innocence
because whenever you have one person
like a citizen presumption of innocence
that's just got to be the way no there's
no wiggle room there whatsoever but if
you're talking about the whole
organization yeah they're guilty
you better prove you're not guilty when
the evidence suggests you are
like that's their problem yeah they need
to fix that not me that's not my problem
the presumption of guilt is on them is
that my fault
should I take any responsibility
for the fact that I presume guilt on the
FBI in the specific case I say no
I say I'm completely free of any bad
feelings about that that is the brand
that they've created
it's the brand that they've presented to
the public and I'm just responding to
their brand
if that's who they tell us they are why
am I going to like mind read and come up
with some different hypothesis
I'm going to take I'm going to take the
brand that they present and just say if
that's who you are that's who you are
so keep an eye on that I have no idea
what Keith Renee did or did not do I
will tell you that the The Branding part
of it was
that part I can say for sure
yeah that that was willing adults doing
willing adult stuff period
and everything about that was just taken
out of context
that part I can say was with some
confidence
so I saw a survey that said that
when asked the question of whether the
black Americans
should be given any extra help
to succeed
because other ethnic groups did not get
any any extra help in their histories
but of course you can't compare right
there's nothing like the the legacy of
slavery doesn't really compare to Irish
people being discriminated against right
so these are not the same thing but
the question was asked
the question was asked of black people
and non-black people
do you think that black Americans should
get a little extra boost
to compensate for past injustices
and surprisingly
uh guess what black people said about
themselves
versus what white liberals said about
black people
black people said about themselves
we don't need that much help you know
we're fine
so black people were far more likely to
say we don't need any extra help
than white liberals were
white liberals said black people need
extra help to succeed
black people themselves not so much now
we got what we need
that is there's no other thing how do
you
how could you possibly label this except
racist
is this not the most racist thing you've
ever seen
I don't know how else to interpret that
do you if it's white liberals who think
black people can't succeed without help
but the black people themselves again
these are averages right we're not
talking every person in every group but
on average there's a big difference
a pretty big difference
the black people think that they can
succeed
and white liberals think maybe not
now
I've always suspected
that the real racists were the liberals
who had this point of view because it's
hard to hold the point of view that they
there's some Greek group needs extra
help unless you're also making some
assumptions about the people in the
group now
they would say it's not about the people
in the group it's about the
circumstances which they're in
which would be a perfectly good argument
it's just interesting how
the biases of the two different groups
are not lining up the way you would
imagine they would
right it's kind of opposite of how you
imagined and
to the credit
to the credit of black Americans
I do appreciate the fact that black
Americans are not putting you know
putting off responsibility on other
people
that's a good sign
that's who you want in your America you
want Americans who say wait a minute
stop telling me you need to help me how
about I how about I figure this out on
my own I don't need your help
that's that's what I want
give me give me some more of those
Americans please
well speaking of
yay
uh the artist who used to be called
Kanye
the part two of his interview with
Tucker was on and
my goodness
does this man know how to get attention
in the best possible way
um you know I've said before but there
are a few people in our culture
that you can just feel really confident
in calling them a genius
you know Elon Musk
I feel comfortable calling him a genius
right Kanye I feel very comfortable
calling him a genius
because his his uh his intelligence does
expand Beyond art you know he's he's
much bigger uh cultural character
but his importance I don't think can be
understated
um Do You Remember When
well most of you don't you're not old
enough in the 60s
can you remember if any of you are old
enough the peace sign was political
because the Vietnam War right so if you
were doing the peace sign or you showed
the little peace sign
it was a political statement
and if you were a conservative you
wouldn't want to maybe you wouldn't want
to use it because that would indicate
you were maybe
on the left
right but over time over time the
Vietnam War fades
in our memory and the peace symbol just
turns into well who doesn't like peace
and plus the symbol itself is sort of
attractive to look at
so the other peace symbol becomes more
of a just a generic
you know positive thing
I feel as if that's what yay did with
black lives matter as a as a slogan and
as a visual
visual element
I think Kanye marked the point
where it's no longer a political
statement
I believe he made it possible that
somebody like me
could wear this shirt on ironically
so I want to make it clear I'm not
wearing this ironically
why well I'm just I'm going to just take
a page from my spiritual leader
if you that's my dog snoring
can you hear my dog snoring
anyway so
uh
so yay being my
spiritual leader
uh has essentially made it safe
for me to just say what is uh true and
obvious
that black lives matter
nothing needs to be added to that right
because now it's sort of taken out of
politics
once you take it out into politics I can
fully embrace it
fully embrace it yeah black lives matter
let's make sure we live that okay
but
before yea
wore his white lives matter shirt I
would have said this is purely political
and I don't want to wear a shirt that
makes a political statement
I just generally don't wear clothes that
make political statements it wouldn't
matter what direction it was I don't
wear political clothes but now he's
taking it out of the political
now it's art
who else could have done that
think about it
all right I gotta go wake up my dog
because I can't hear myself talking hold
on
there you go
without
wake up
all right
yeah she's old
all right I'm back
put on my microphones bear with me a
second
I couldn't even hear myself thinking
as loud as it was Where You Are
it was like it was like a jet engine in
the room
all right
so
let's talk about Kanye some more um I
don't know if you caught this but in one
of the clips
he said the following sentence and there
was no follow-up to this it was just
dropped in
did you catch this
Connie you said at one point and it was
sort of not really even
as connected to the question as you
thought maybe it should have been
but Kanye said if Trump was the first
black president
that he Kanye would be the first
Hispanic president
did you hear that he said he'd be the
first Hispanic president and then he
said why
do you know why
because he says they on average they
they share his views about God and
Country and hard work I guess so
basically he was saying that you know
the so the jokes on the Democrats
that the people coming into the country
that that they want to bring in they're
they're all Republicans
they're they're just Republicans and
waiting you know
and and I was the first one to warn you
I think
tell me if I was am I the first one to
warn you
because I'm you know I'm marinated in
immigrant culture where I live
and I started to notice this a while ago
whenever whenever I'd be in a private
conversation they'd be pro-trump and I
think to myself
well that's probably just a one-off
I can't believe that's a common view
and then I think four out of five people
from born in other countries when I
would talk to them privately because
they won't say it out loud they
literally whisper
literally whisper
you know you know I I do like kind of
trump
so Kanye of course has noticed as well
and uh I think that was a funny comment
all right
um the other thing that Kanye was
talking about or yay uh is that
he couldn't say that he liked Trump for
years because he was bullied in
Hollywood and and he also didn't want to
make things worse for his children
and he makes a great point
you know that even as someone who is you
know prominent and successful as he is
and he's an artist So in theory he could
say more than other people could say
even he did not have free speech
because he had to worry about the effect
of his children
just for saying sort of normal political
things not even crazy stuff just normal
political stuff and he was afraid for
his children
I think about that but apparently now
out of for whatever reason he's he is
more open about it but I can I can
confirm that as an artist
that when I first got married my first
marriage I had step kids in my first
marriage and the the first thing that
happened was I couldn't I couldn't do my
job
as soon as I got married
and I I got I think I can tell you this
yeah I don't think there's any reason I
can't tell you this correct me if I've
ever told you this before
so uh when I got married
my first wife was had a prior marriage
and they had two kids and was finishing
up you know that marriage part of their
uh legal agreement which sort of dragged
on for a while was that
um the judge agreed with her ex-husband
that her new husband could not write
about his family life if it involved
mentioning the children
so just just hold this into your head
that two people who were not me so I'm
not involved in this there's a judge
and there's an ex-husband to my wife
the guy I basically hardly know right at
the time and those two could agree what
I could write about not me I didn't cite
anything
but think about that I mean just hold
that in your head
how messed up that is
that I was legally barred from doing my
job because you know what my job is
when I'm writing or doing the comic it's
mostly it's autobiographical
when I write I write about the things
that happen to me
that's what I do for a living I actually
got married and it closed down my
ability to write for several years
and I did not write about the things
that were really would have been good to
write about like the things that you're
Salient and everybody everybody would
recognize you know family types of
interactions and stuff couldn't do any
of it
it just destroyed my career for years
and I also couldn't be provocative in
general
because of the effect it might have on
children
true story
and also when my parents were alive
I also kept myself under the you know
the the trouble level that you wouldn't
want your parents to ever find out about
but now they're both gone
and the children are old enough that you
know nothing I do would bother them at
this point
so
I'm basically free
um if if I don't mind getting canceled
economically which is of course
happening
um I'm free or close to free I'm Freer
than you are
I I can say more than you can say
so here's an interesting story
um
so you know over in Ukraine there's this
area called Crimea
that in 20
what what year was it that Russia
captured it back from Ukraine 2014.
2014.
so the thing you need to know is that
Crimea has you know gone back and forth
between Ukraine and Russia ownership
but at the moment
Putin owns it
now did you think that Putin was a
badass before
but remember John Brennan
who used to head at the CIA so you know
he's totally credible he wouldn't lie to
you John Brennan told us that it was
probably Putin who blew up that pipeline
between Russia and Germany and even
though it was Putin's own asset in a
sense something that he could use for
making money
um that he did it to show that his reach
could extend anywhere
and that he was a badass and he would
blow up anything Not only would he blow
up anything
but he would blow up his own pipeline he
was such a badass
and I thought to myself well that that
can't be true
I thought to myself John Brennan you're
so wrong
there's no realistic way
that he's blowing up his own asset
and then I saw that the bridge between
Crimea and Russia got taken out
and I thought my God
it's true John Brennan was right
Putin is such a badass he's now
attacking all of his own assets
he might start bombing his own military
to scare us pretty soon
I don't know
but
I worry that Putin will use a nuclear
weapon on Moscow
to really show us he's serious
have you ever seen any of those movies
where the bad guy has captured the good
guy and and the and the writer wants to
show you that the bad guy is really bad
the bad guy is not just ordinary bad the
bad guy is really bad so the bad guy
murders his own employee
right in front of you well that's bad
yeah that's what Putin's doing his same
play so Putin first takes out his his
own uh pipeline asset I don't know the
ownership doesn't matter but it was his
asset
takes out that asset now obviously I
mean I don't need John Brennan to tell
me this because I can do some of the
analysis myself right I don't need John
Brennan for everything
so it's obvious that Putin is um because
really John Brennan actually predicted
it didn't he Brennan actually said this
might not be the end of it he might keep
attacking stuff like this so it looks
like Putin is probably
attacked his own most important asset to
Crimea
which some some people would say would
cause him to lose Crimea because they
can't resupply it
but I think the bigger point is that
he's showing us what a badass he is
so Putin is now attacking his own assets
um and I do worry about him using a
tactical nuclear weapon on Moscow
because wouldn't that scare you
I mean I'd be like oh this this guy he
he's he's nuking his own City we get we
need to give him anything he wants
anything he wants
so
I don't know
you might have to take out a few other
Russian cities before Ukraine is willing
to negotiate
but I think if he takes out
you know it's really just a matter of
will at this point it's a question of
how many Russian cities would Putin be
able be willing to Nuke
before Ukraine surrendered
and a fear I think between four and five
so maybe Moscow St Petersburg and three
other Russian cities that I can't think
of because I don't know anything about
Russian cities
but I think four to five Russian cities
after Putin nukes them
uh
uh if I was a lensky I would just
surrender at that point I'd be like sure
crazy I Surrender
so Russia is closer to winning this war
than you think
uh hat tip to Joe Moore
who first noticed this Putin might
attack his own Bridge idea which is
pretty clever
um
did I I told you yesterday that
apparently Ukraine has a lot of lithium
unexploited so far like a lot of lithium
like we really need that lithium
Afghanistan a lot of lithium
huh
do you remember when we always used to
get into Wars wherever there was oil
it'd be like oh there's oil there we're
going to get into war
and now it's lithium
apparently lithium is the new oil now
there's nobody official or smart
well I wouldn't say smart but there's
nobody official
who is saying that lithium has anything
to do with why we're in Ukraine
it's just sort of a lucky coincidence
isn't it
remember I told you that follow the
money works even when it doesn't
make any sense
even when it shouldn't
it just always works huh isn't that
weird
isn't that weird
that there are trillions of dollars
worth of lithium that we need to advance
Society
and it's in Ukraine
and we're putting absolutely everything
we can into Ukraine to make sure we
still have access to
Ukraine
huh how what a weird coincidence that
it's exactly in our financial interest
too
what about that huh
total coincidence
um
oh the other thing Kanye was saying is
his kids are being indoctrinated in
schools
they're learning that Kwanzaa is a thing
but Christmas isn't
I don't know how true that is but I know
so yeah I'm hearing Kanye say that the
kids are being brainwashed in school
he's right I mean he's 100 right
but it's more powerful when he says it
now there's a story today that PayPal is
updating its user agreement
and it would allow them to take up to
twenty five hundred dollars out of your
account
if you do various bad things and one of
those bad things is spread
disinformation
what what
that's right
PayPal's new agreement says
that if they accuse you of spreading
disinformation they can just take money
out of your account and keep it
because you spread disinformation
uh
I wonder if that is the SG
that's a good question do you think
that's the SG
or is it you know somehow a cousin of
ESG the the forces that are causing this
now
you want to hear an even better story
did you know that credit card processing
companies
that processed the various credit cards
from different companies so it's not a
credit card company
but a company that credit card companies
use between the retailer and
um and them so there's a Processing
Company that sits between the business
and the credit card the Processing
Company
in some cases
will give you a contract that will be
have lots of fine print
and some of the frying prints says we
can take money and we can take as much
money as we want and if your checking
account and not give you a reason
we simply have to say that you did
something bad and accuse you
and then we have the right to take as
much money as we want out of your
account forever
um I once uh owned a business and signed
that contract
because you know you a credit card a
Processing Company who reads the who
reads the fine print
nobody like probably not one person has
ever read that fine print
and what do you think happened
sooner or later
they claimed that something we did
caused a vulnerability in
on the user data or something
and that the vulnerability in our system
in in the restaurant as it was the
vulnerability in our system caused a
larger vulnerability that caused a
six-figure loss and they started to
drain six figures that's over a hundred
thousand dollars
I think it was a few hundred thousand
dollars and of my checking account
meaning the business checking account
without notice
so we immediately contact the lawyer and
say uh uh what's going on here because
you know they when we contacted the
company or the bank or however however
we found out what was happening because
our our uh checking account went to zero
this is an active business an active
business at our checking account went to
zero and every time a deposit went in it
immediately came out and went to this
company
so they got I don't know
a few tens of thousands I think before
we figured out what was going on and
shut the account
then they sued us
for six figures I forget what it was
and they said basically there's nothing
you can do because you signed the
contract and it's just it's black and
white you actually signed the contract
which we did this is true this said you
can take money out of her account just
because you claimed something happened
with no evidence show you just have to
claim it
so what do you think happened
well I can't tell you exactly what
happened because I had to sign an
agreement saying that I wouldn't talk
about it it's part of the settlement so
I can't tell you I can't tell you what
companies are involved
I can't tell you how it ended
I can tell you that I didn't pay any
more money except to my lawyer
and the lawyers did a good job I can
tell you that
but uh
I'll also tell you
the sooner or later I'm going to crash
that company
I'm going to destroy them and my I might
wait a few years
I wait a few years and I'll have to find
some way to do it without naming them in
this situation since I signed an
agreement
but I'm going to find another way to do
it
I'm going to find a back door
I'm gonna own them
however long it takes but I can't do it
yet
but I'm very patient I'm very patient
and I'm gonna take their nuts
off
eventually it's a very big company it's
one you've heard of
uh but when I'm done with them maybe
maybe you won't hear about them
all right
um
Chris saliza who writes for CNN
um was most famous in my opinion for
doing anti-trump commentary during the
Trump Administration now I don't know if
this is a sign of you know the new CNN
direction or not but his opinion piece
today
uh he's talking about how Biden's
popularity is you know genuinely bad
basically it's worse than everybody's
except trumps at some point and uh with
this bad approval you'd expect something
like losing 37 seats or more
in the midterms
so
I don't know
do you think it's going to go exactly
the way it looks like it's going to go
the Biden's popularity will cause a
massive shift in in the house
everything says it's going to go this
way
but are you concerned at all
there's something who knows what
might might change this obvious
Direction
it could be because the elections are so
fortified yeah they might be fortified
I don't know
I just don't believe in the obvious
happening anymore
just in general
if every time it was obvious something
was going to happen but it's months away
if you bet against it how often would
you be right
what if you just bet against the obvious
every time
you'd be read a lot
you'd be right a lot
do you know that my most uh my most
shocking predictions were all the ones
where I just bet against the obvious
you know I bet that Trump would win when
everybody bet he was a clown
right so I bet that I bet the Ukraine
would kick Russia's ass
when it was obvious that wasn't going to
happen
obviously right what could be more
obvious than the Russian RB would win
against Ukraine all the experts said so
I have done against the obvious
who was right so far I'm the only one
right in the whole world I'm the
only one who got that right
by the way can you do a fact check
can you find anybody
anybody
any let's say anybody who's a public
figure or an expert
who said that Ukraine actually
would come out well compared to the
Russian military in this particular
thing did anybody else say that
Malcolm Nance
oh okay well just Malcolm Nance and me I
guess
all right but
now imagine if you had put no thinking
into these predictions and all you did
was predict that whatever we think is
true will be the opposite
if you had predicted that the
vaccinations would not work
that would be opposite of the experts
that's what I predicted I predicted the
vaccines the vaccinations would not be
vaccinations
that's pretty radical right
just pick the opposite of what you think
is going to happen and you're probably
going to hit it at least half of the
time
just by betting the opposite of what is
obvious
because we get pretty uh sold on our own
ability to to know what's true and
what's obvious
all right was there anything else
happening today
uh how many of you saw the
Joe Biden speech I think he was in
Pennsylvania
an awesome state
uh
Eddie says
I've got two words for you made in
America
now
how many people would not have corrected
that the me the moment they said made in
America
wouldn't almost anybody with a
functioning brain have said haha I guess
that's three words but you know what I
mean made in America
wouldn't
wouldn't everybody
catch that
it's hard to even imagine anybody who
wouldn't have noticed the made in
America's three words
now is that an indication of mental
instability
I don't know
all right I would like to do a little
exercise now that I sometimes do
which is arguing the opposite of the
case I would normally argue
you ready for this
so so let me let me give you the
um I don't know if this is a
counter-intuitive or I'm not sure how
many people would agree with this all
right I'm going to give you a following
argument that Biden is a genius
because don't would you agree that the
standard belief is that even if you
support him
even if you support him you're thinking
he's not all there but maybe his
advisors are helping and I'll ride it
out
so I'm going to argue that Biden is on
the verge of one of the biggest
accomplishments in American history
it looks like it
if it's true then our future requires
lithium
I don't know if that's true but you know
there's a good assumption that what it
might
if it's true and if it's true that one
of the reasons that we're so gung-ho
about supporting Ukraine not the only
reason but one of the big reasons if one
of the big reasons is we need we need a
supply of lithium
and the other places don't have enough
or they're unfriendly countries
that's why Biden has been so aggressive
in protecting them
and and by the new at some point that he
could take out the Russian entire energy
infrastructure and replace it with
American Energy infrastructure which is
happening
and if he knew he could degrade their
military
for so long that they would not be a an
international threat
this is one of the greatest
he's on the verge of one of the greatest
foreign policy successes in American
history
and I'm actually completely serious
the thing we don't know is how much is
intentional
right
am I right if if Trump had done
everything that Biden has done about
Ukraine
what would I say about it
right let's do the issue on the other
foot test this is the dershowitz test
shoe on the other foot
if if Trump had uh supported Ukraine and
amazingly against everybody's uh
impression amazingly Ukraine came out
winning
would I call Trump a genius
yes
I know I know it hurts for me to say
this
but correct me you're not arguing right
if Trump had done everything that Biden
has done up to this point I would call
Trump a genius
because he would have known that it
could work out and I didn't know it
right
so it's possible that one of the one of
the outcomes here
would be Putin either completely
um
powerless
in terms of influencing things we care
about
maybe permanently degraded and
permanently out of the oil business all
right here's here's a frame for you to
understand this whole point
Whoever has the best energy business
wins
that's it the energy business and and
your military are pretty connected the
energy business and your economy are
pretty connected your economy and your
military are pretty connected your
energy business predicts everything
energy predicts everything
so in one in one action
the United States by backing Ukraine has
not only maybe
and again these are all maybes has maybe
secured one of the biggest supplies of
lithium that we could ever secure
because we have a friendly trading
partner now
but also
replaced Russia as the energy producer
for Europe
how big is that that's about as big as
it gets and also remove the Russian
blackmail threat
I hate to tell you but the Biden
Administration whoever's making all the
decisions may have may be on the verge
of one of the something that's as big as
the Louisiana Purchase
did you buy that
in American history if this works out
the way it's going and that's that's a
big if
that's a really big if
right very big if I'm not saying it will
but if it goes the way it's going and
that's how it ends up
this will be one of the greatest
American foreign policy
moves of all time it'll be up there with
like the Marshall Plan
it's going to be up there
now those of you who are having uh who
are starting to and I know it's going to
come
if I'm triggering you into cognitive
dissonance the way you'll know is you'll
start to insult me personally
and I'm watching for it right
watch for the personal insults those are
the people who just can't deal with the
fact that this might be true
now it's also possible that Biden will
start a nuclear war
it's also possible that if Trump had
been president there would be no war at
all
but if there had been nowhere at all you
still have a powerful Russia and growing
you still have a Europe that's under
Russia's control
because they wouldn't have turned off
the pipeline just because Trump wanted
it
and we wouldn't have a supply of lithium
and we've lost what zero zero military
that are American
so if Biden pulls this off he will spend
whatever whatever is the price tag is it
going to be I don't know 20 billion
dollars
what's it going to cost when we're all
done
I'm not really paying it is 20 billion
in the range
something like that
or is it way bigger
I don't well a trillion is what
Afghanistan was
uh you think it'll be over 100 billion
all right so say it's over 100 billion
the the energy that we're going to sell
to Europe that's that replaced Russia
plus the value of the lithium
is trillions
it's trillions low trillions
we may be spending we may be spending
200 billion
to get back trillions
it's an insanely good investment unless
there's nuclear war right if there's
nuclear war everything goes to hell so
you don't know what you know Putin's
gonna do could go anyway
but at the moment
the moment now I saw a clip of uh
of uh Trump back when he was in office
saying that it's crazy to not be friends
with Russia
and that you know basically we should
figure out a way to live with them
imagine Trump coming into office after
uh after Russia's been beaten down by
this war
Trump would be the number one best
choice
for somebody to say all right Russia
you're in bad shape
but we can work with you if you want
it's just not under the old rules you
know we'll we we would like to help you
be a stable country because you have
nukes but just we don't want you to be
troubled to us
I think Trump could make that work
yeah I think I think Trump could Trump
could bring Russia back into some
productive
arrangement with the rest of the world I
think
yeah let me be clear about this I'm not
celebrating that we made a profit at the
expense of uh you know I don't know a
hundred thousand dead people in the
Ukraine both Russian and Ukrainian I'm
not saying that I would have chosen it
but the ukrainians were probably going
to fight anyway
the the war probably was going to happen
one way or the other so the ukrainians
are doing what the ukrainians want to do
I don't know if I call
uh that's not the same kind of tragedy
as something that just happens to you
they're choosing a risky fight for a big
game
and
you know they're pretty brave and pretty
amazing
what happened if we didn't bankroll it
well something would have happened and
the ukrainians wouldn't have liked it
apparently
all right
um I'm very curious about your reaction
if you if you accept what the framing
that I gave you as
an exercise
if you just just take it as an exercise
did I accomplish the shoe on the other
foot
give me that so your first feedback is
did my shoe on the other foot
did it did it Enlighten you in some way
where you said holy
yeah all right so would you say that
that is a useful exercise is that useful
I feel like it is I feel like that's
useful
here's the question I'll always get one
do you know anything about Russia I'm
not asking rude minor I just wonder do
you know anything about any do I know
any Russian folks
um well I have talked to some Russians
recently but I wouldn't say I have any
Russian expertise
I would also say that the people who are
experts are the least credible people in
our world right now
it shouldn't be that way
but it is it's not my choice
it's just where we are and what we
learned is that experts will lie to you
so it's not a question that I know more
than the experts of course I don't
of course I don't
but I can tell when people are lying
okay so I'm good at I'm a good at
detecting liars I'm good at detecting
um
hoaxes
I'm good at detecting when somebody's
missed something obvious
because sometimes we have cognitive
blindness to stuff and if you're not if
you're not in that same bias sphere
you can just see stuff that the people
who are in the bubble can see
so when I make a prediction that's
opposite of the experts
I'm never saying I know more than the
experts
I'm saying I know something different
and what I might know different is I
know how to spot a liar so I don't need
to know what you know I can just tell
you're lying
so that's what I do so what I do is I
try to stick to what I know
not what the experts know
is that fair
I think that's a good way to put it
I'm going to detecting liars and I'm
single
that was funny
oh let's talk about Herschel Walker
so I'm I'm sort of generally sort of
half following the story and I guess
he's accused of
uh of paying for an abortion for his
girlfriend
at the same time he's anti-abortion
I don't have any problem with that at
all
I don't even know why it's a story
well now I get that you have a problem
with it but why do I have a problem with
it
I can't even figure out why that's even
an issue
number one
that's their business
that's their business number two it was
legal
it was legal it was legal and it was
private and it was their business number
three
paying for it
is sort of a
honorable thing to do if it's going to
happen anyway
I get that he could have you know tried
to use economic Force to force a woman
to do something she didn't want to do I
get that he could have done that but
that would have
uh been less than honorable in my
opinion now what is Honorable of course
is subject to
personal opinion right so if you have a
different opinion about that I actually
wouldn't feel
that I needed to attack it at all
so if you said to yourself you know
it's murder abortions murder if you put
if you give it any any support at all
then you're aiding murder if that's your
view
I I respect that I respect that
but it doesn't bother me that somebody
did something that's legal
and supported somebody who was in a
tough place and was not going to change
their mind
if he tried to talk her out of it I
don't know if that happened
but if he tried to talk her out of it
and failed
and then paid for it
I don't have a problem with social
Walker at all
I mean you could ask why you didn't wear
a condom but that's not the level that
I'm going to get into
now
correct me if wrong did Hershey Walker
deny that he paid for it is he saying it
didn't happen
give me a fact check on that I thought I
saw something where he was denying
something he denied everything
did he deny the pregnancy
he has no memory of it
oh he denies that money was for the
abortion
uh well so there might be more to the
story
yeah if I ever taught you the ratio of
celebrity stories that are true
of all celebrity stories
what how many what percentage of them do
you think are accurate
so this would be a celebrity story
maybe 20 20.
about 20. that's just based on my own
experience
now the things they tend to get right
are names and dates
and uh anything that's on video you know
there's some things I get right well
actually even the video stuff would be
out of context
but so just based on reporting about me
I mean what was the literally the last
report about me called me a right-wing
cartoonist
that's the last things that the media
said about me
completely all right so here's here's
who the media called
the right wing cartoonist
totally non-ironically wearing the shirt
because as Kanye taught us
what is the only correct answer when
somebody says why are you wearing this
shirt
the only correct answer is
because it's obvious
because it's true
yeah it's obvious
so that's so that that should give you
an idea
what the uh what the what the media's
accuracy rate is all right
because it's obvious
um
you know
it's to cover up my abs yes I don't want
to I don't want to intimidate anybody
all right was there any other story that
I forgot to talk about
or you want attention
I always love it when somebody accuses
me of seeking attention
do you know what I do for a living
I I seek attention for a living
that's that's my whole business model
I don't get paid a cent
unless I get your attention
that's a hundred percent of what I do
all day long is I try to get your
attention
the only way I can get and hold your
attention is if it's entertaining or
useful
am I right if it's not entertaining and
it's not useful I can't hold your
attention
so do you have a problem with that if I
try to be useful and or entertaining I
try to be both
but
but does that does that sit poorly with
you
of course I'm trying to get your
attention
of course but I'm pretty transparent
about it aren't I
yeah
did have I also not admitted to you that
I never do things for one reason
I've told you that right
if anybody ever tells you they did
something for one reason you should
automatically be skeptical
I never do anything for one reason
yeah what is there one reason I'm
wearing this shirt
no
there are multiple reasons and one of
them is absolutely I I do for a living I
get attention
so that's absolutely one of the reasons
of course
of course it is
but it doesn't mean it's not true
like I don't have to lie about it black
lives matter
there's nothing there's nothing to add
you're waiting for me to wear white
lives matter out in public
well you know
here's the thing that's not exactly a
free speech issue is it
I mean it's in the neighborhood of free
speech
but if you're intentionally provocative
that's sort of what your speech is
so in that case I would say your speech
is not
White lives matter
if you were aware that if I were to wear
that shirt in public what I would be
saying is punch me
I mean that's what I would be
communicating I'd like you to punch me
and I wouldn't do that
now I wouldn't have worn this shirt
until Kanye turned it into art
which is also true
which makes it good art
yeah if it weren't true I don't think
I'd wear it
well maybe I would if it was if it were
funny or something but I didn't have to
didn't have to deal with that
in other words the newspaper Comics
politically don't show true reality well
of course
of course not
uh Florida Surgeon General
recommending against the MRNA vaccine
for men from 18 to 39. you know it's
funny I
I thought that was already the
recommendation
is anybody going to ever tell us the
truth that the reason vaccinations were
required for the young is for the
benefit of the old
I mean that was always why it was but
now that doesn't really even apply does
it since it doesn't stop it from
spreading
did it ever make sense that young people
got the vaccination
if Omicron is you know in the in the
context of Omicron young healthy people
should get vaccinations I I don't know
if that I don't even know if that's news
is it
is that news I mean I'm not even
I'm not under 39 and even I wouldn't get
a vaccination now
I I'm just sort of surprised that that's
even news
yeah
now here's here's a question that's
really interesting to me
the excess deaths that we keep seeing
um do you think we'll ever know
if it was caused by the long covid or
the vaccination itself
or both or neither
do you think we'll ever know that
I'm gonna I'm gonna bet on never
I'm going to bet on never because I
don't believe that our scientists are
allowed to study that
or if they did and they got the wrong
answer I don't believe they'd be allowed
to publish it and if they publish it the
media would ignore it
there from here
it's like there's you know there's this
and there's this but there's no path
between them I don't know that we'll
ever know the truth of that
that's that's not a good not a good
situation to be in
all right I believe I've done my one
hour of Awesome
awesome content awesome
let me just check with you
how many think that it could turn out
the history will say that the Biden
Administration
did a good job on Ukraine
how many think that history will judge
it positively
see now but check yourself check check
your bias
how much of your answers do you think
are biaspaced
now I'm also making a big assumption
that things end well without a nuclear
Holocaust if we get the nuclear
Holocaust then of course he'll be judged
quite harshly
it depends on the writer depends if the
writer is a Democrat or Republican
probably yeah
yeah
anyway uh but I but I hope you at least
appreciated the exercise of arguing from
the other side
is anybody bothered by that
does that does it bother anybody when I
um transparently argue the other side
just to see if they've got something
there
all right
yeah I I personally find it fun to learn
that everything I knew was wrong or that
there's another way to look at it
to me that's always exciting
but I feel like to some people it's
threatening
to learn that everything they thought
was wrong or could be wrong or that
there's another way to look at it
it's a good exercise it's real good
exercise
the the other one that's related to that
is what if everything's opposite
you know not just politics
but because I'm a cartoonist I sort of
live in that world where I take
everything that I see and then the first
thing I do to it is I say well what if
it was the opposite of that because
that's how cartoonists think
it's like the normal situation is your
doctor
you know it helps you stay healthy
but the cartoonist goes to the doctor
and says what if it's the other way well
what if the doctor's tried to kill me
would that be funny and it is a little
funny
so my dog moved from her place
to be closer to me and now she's snoring
again
writers didn't need to do the same
firemen caused fires
you know speaking of fires I realized
that the one reason why the idea of
taking all the homeless and the drug
people and putting them in their own
location you know put them on a farm
somewhere is they would burn it down
am I wrong
if you move the homeless to any like you
know beautiful Wilderness Area or
something wouldn't they just Burn It
Down
because I don't I don't imagine that
they're real careful with fire
I mean not intentionally I just think
well maybe intentionally because they
have mental illness as well in many
cases
but I'd love to try it here's what I
believe
I believe that a segment of society will
not be able to deal with Modern Life and
will have to be on some kind of drugs
permanently
and will not be able to integrate with
the rest of the world because of the
drugs and maybe other things as well
we can't kill them we can't live with
them
you can't kill them
I'm not recommending that
can't kill them and he can't live with
them
there is an obvious solution
they have to live in a different place
but not in some places cruel you know
not locked up in a little room
can we do anything that's kind and and
empathetic and maybe even beautiful and
just let people who can't live in our
world
live in their world
number two I'd like to test this
hypothesis out on you I've mentioned it
before
but
people who actually do drugs
will tell you that the risk of drugs is
mostly in the purity
or knowing what you have
and that if you solve that you would
have a whole bunch of functional addicts
who could integrate with society and you
wouldn't even necessarily know they were
addicts
you just wouldn't even know
they would just be below the level where
it's causing them you know obvious
physical harm
probably it's always harmful
but they would be happy enough
because they need this little extra
boost but they've learned to have the
right Purity so they get exactly the
right boost that they want and they stay
within this thin band of not too blown
away and still functional
so I feel like we have to do the brave
thing and there's nobody who can say it
out loud
we have to figure out how to keep
functional addicts in our midst and
those who can't be functional we have to
separate them
and probably the only path to that is to
test it
right and if you say it's a good idea or
a bad idea you're wrong
if you say the idea of giving addicts
pure drugs with no fentanyl if you say
that's a good idea or a bad idea you're
both wrong
the only thing you can say is that it
hasn't been tested in all the ways it
could be tested
maybe it's been tested like San
Francisco had a sort of a disastrous
open-air needle thing
I'm not sure you should be you should be
satisfying the needle people
by the time you're putting it into your
in your arm with a needle
I don't know enough about this world but
maybe they're already too far gone right
maybe they're not the ones you can bring
back but the ones who are snorting it
smoking it or taking the pill
I believe those are people trying to be
functional addicts
and maybe succeeding in some cases
so I think we have to do the brave thing
and say that some people are going to be
functional addicts how do we keep them
alive
and some people can't be helped how do
we keep them separate from us
those two questions are the dangerous
ones that we can't answer
because you don't want to be a jerk
right it doesn't show empathy and it
doesn't
you know it just feels like you're being
a bad person when you say that but I
think we've got to grow up
we just got to grow up and just say
we're gonna have to legalize
honestly I think at this point
um because of Fentanyl
I would legalize everything
does anybody disagree
if you take fentanyl out of the equation
I would be tempted to say some things
should still be illegal because we want
to keep you off the heroin and the
cocaine
but if moving people to heroin and
cocaine is safer which is the current
situation
moving people from fentanyl to heroin
will keep them alive
you know statistically that's more
likely still dangerous but we're not
this is not your uh and you've seen a
number of people say this Geraldo said
this yesterday on Fox News Geraldo was
saying you know he's obviously seen
everything
there's an understatement Geraldo has
seen everything
that's like the truest thing anybody's
ever said
I think geraldo's seen everything
is there anything that Geraldo hasn't
seen
I mean really he's literally seeing
everything and even Geraldo says this
fentanyl this is not like anything we've
ever seen
this is not like a drugs this is a whole
different animal
and in that context
the question of legalizing heroin
becomes probably yes
if you take fentanyl away I'd say I
don't know I'm leaning toward now
I'm leaning toward now and I'm I'm
pretty soft on drug crimes
and I even I would lean toward no
but as soon as you put fentanyl in the
mix and it kills 100 000 a year
I say everything's wrong
everything you know is wrong
because of fentanyl
if you don't get the politicians to say
the following words nothing could ever
happen here's the following words
because of fentanyl
everything we've ever done with drugs
before is wrong
they need to know that
because here's the other thing they say
if we build the wall
we can reduce fentanyl nope
if you build the wall you can reduce
marijuana you know why because marijuana
is big
you can't make money shipping like a
handful of marijuana
but you could make a million dollars
shipping enough fentanyl that I could
reach through the fence on the border
wall because the border wall is a fence
it's got you know you can reach your
hand through it am I wrong you could
take like a million dollars worth of
Fentanyl and say hey Bob uh it's Juan
over here Bob um I'm going to reach
through with the fence at all uh why
don't you take this and go sell it it's
a million dollars
and then he sells it a million dollars
so you have you have the Republicans are
fighting the last war there it is
I got it
I got it
you know there are some phrases that
work on everybody
here's one
you want a phrase that will fix the
Republicans because the Republicans are
just barking up the wrong wall they're
literally looking at they've put all
their emphasis on the wall and that has
no impact they'll have no impact
so here's what I'm going to say to
Republicans on the drug war if you're
building a wall to stop Fentanyl
you're you're fighting the last war
you're fighting the old war the new war
is not senses don't work on the new war
might have worked for marijuana
even cocaine
right but we have to convince
Republicans that they're fighting the
wrong War
the current War might require
legalizing stuff they don't want to
legalize
it might
yeah
um the other the other thing would be
just to level the the cartels
now you know how you can tell that your
government is not serious about Fentanyl
I'm going to say something now and as
soon as I say it your jaw is going to
hit the floor
we have never asked the head of the
cartels to negotiate
it's pause
just pause and think about that we have
never the United States has never asked
the head of the cartels to negotiate
and again
why would you ask them to negotiate if
they were selling you cocaine and
marijuana maybe you would
but that's last war
this is not last war this war goes like
this hey cartels we want to talk to you
we'd like you to stop everything
like all the illegal stuff
but if you send us one more
ounce of fentanyl we're going to kill
all of you
do you understand that
we're going to kill all of you
and then do it just kill all of them
and then when they rebuild because they
would
you kill all of them
and then when they rebuild
kill all of them and just repeat
just forever
right now if they say oh we're
going to get out of the fence and all
business and we'll go back to our cat
and mouse game with you know with
cocaine and
maybe you know maybe maybe we go back to
our old game maybe
don't have to but maybe
but
but give me your reaction to that
statement if the United States
government is not directly asking for
is the asking for this important part
asking to negotiate with the head of the
cartel
we are not serious people
true or false we're not serious people
if we're not asking to negotiate
if you're in a war and you don't at
least ask
could we negotiate this away and you're
not going to fight
pick one government
negotiate or fight
or Surrender
negotiate fight or Surrender which of
those three things are we doing
 nothing
no we're not fighting oh we're trying is
capturing stuff at the border which
makes no difference we're capturing
stuff
how about giving that advice to Ukraine
hey you've been you've been invaded by
Russia there are three things we don't
want you to do don't fight don't
negotiate and don't surrender
anything else is fine
but don't do one of those three things
don't fight negotiate or surrender in
your War
but that's what we're doing with the
cartels we've eliminated the only three
things you do in war
fight negotiate surrender
those are the only three
we're doing the fourth thing that's not
even a thing
the fourth thing capturing some of your
weapons at the border
Jesus Christ
all right well enough of that
black lives matter
go Ukraine
and I will not be banned from social
media today
not today
I put my pronouns in my profile
um
and if I get canceled now
there's going to be some explaining to
do
somebody'll have some explaining
all right
it is the best show ever I know I didn't
think I could do it but there was best
show ever
and I'm going to say goodbye to YouTube
and Spotify and I'll talk to you
tomorrow
