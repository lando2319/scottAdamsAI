through a road caster and going
us usb c into
uh my ipad and if this sounds better
than my clip-on wireless
lavalier microphone maybe we'll keep
doing this
and if it doesn't well then
we'll do something else but
i believe we have all of two people
watching and
that's exactly the right number
crystal clear well well well
uh good to see all of you we're we're
just here today
for an additional
simultaneous sip now i wasn't planning
this i was just testing out some new uh
new equipment and i don't even know why
i'm not being part of the process so
how would you like to have a
simultaneous sip with a new microphone
say sure because that's the name of the
microphone
go
now what i don't know is how directional
this is
so i'm gonna start moving to the side
and you'll tell me about when you could
no longer hear it as i move to the side
because at some point it's going to look
like my lips are moving
but you're not going to hear anything as
i get a little bit too far from the
microphone
all right this is just a sound test so
don't look for any entertainment
there won't be any those of you who have
heard me
on uh keep the headphones on
why because of the look
oh it did something disconnected from
the headphones somebody said
better with the headphones how is that
possible
uh it wasn't using they shouldn't have
been using the headphone microphone
the sure is not working interesting
sounds like two mics are plugged in oh
okay let's try this
how about that uh
this is actually plugging the uh sure
into it i had it unplugged too
to do the playback myself so
right now it should be a lot better
right
now the the headphones were i think they
have their
built-in microphone but that's not what
i was going for
so all right so this is the highest
quality sound you've heard so far
i can't tell which configuration you're
uh you're
talking to sounds good lower level but
good quality yeah the
the sound level is uh partly what i was
trying to fix
let's see if i had turned it up a little
bit we're going up we're going up
make any difference better or worse
too low sound too low
sound level is better for some and worse
for others
some say muffled some say the quality is
good but still soft
better go higher so that's as high as it
goes on the
on the sound board
use the switch on the back of the mic to
cut the low end
and bring up the high end
sounds like something i could do if
there were a switch on the back
all right well i'll play with that
separately
is it really on yes it's hard to tell
i'm gonna play it back and say use a
screwdriver
um i guess i'll have to read the
instructions to do that
tap the mic
can you hear it yeah it's definitely on
now right
at least that part i'm sure of it's not
that mike
so are you saying that uh that i'm being
picked up it's
picking up a different microphone
oh my headphones were still on
how about this
you didn't hear the tap stay close to
mike
so this is a good example of what i've
been telling you about
for i think four years now i've been
experimenting with different
uh different equipment and every time
you add
a little bit of complication such as
adding another
external microphone everything goes to
hell
so you can't hear the taps
so i don't even know what microphone is
picking up then
all right i'm gonna play back and see
what's going on
thanks for indulging
