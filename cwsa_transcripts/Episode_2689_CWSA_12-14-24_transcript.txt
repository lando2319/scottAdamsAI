joking same as my old
t-shirt well we'll be talking about
drones and all kinds of stuff today soon
as you all stream in
here I've got my comments
working all right it's looking
good good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
while it lasts if you'd like to take
this experience up two levels that
nobody can even understand with their
tiny shiny human brains all you need for
that is a CER mugar glass a tanker
chaler Stein a canteen juger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
that's just the
best well here's my update um the San
Francisco area has a very unusual
warning their warning of
tornadoes now as far as I know I've
lived here all my life in the Bay Area I
don't think there's ever been a tornado
watch for San Francisco now I'm about an
hour outside of San Francisco Frisco and
early this morning it might have been
might have been 500
ammish there was a sound outside my
house that sounded like uh Starship was
landing on my
lawn and I said is that just the rain
because we're having you know Wind and
Rain situation
here but I'd never heard anything like
it it sound it sound like this huge roar
like there was an airplane directly over
my house but closer than it one had ever
been and then it
stopped after maybe 30 seconds and then
several minutes later there was another
one that was the
same and I don't know what they are
however I uh went to perplexity and I
asked that what does a tornado sound
like and they said if you're near a
tornado it sounds like a freight train
that's exactly what it sounded like it
sounded like I was standing next to a
freight train in my yard so I'm not
positive and I got a I got a message
from somebody in San Jose who would be
about an hour from me so that'd be an
hour south of me
Southwest an hour away somebody said
they felt they heard the same
thing an hour
away what was so loud
that San Jose and where I live an hour
away could hear something like a freight
train I don't know what that was but I'm
guessing
tornadoes or Little twisters or
something so there might have been a
tornado somewhere in my neighborhood
just an hour ago I don't know nothing
happened at my house that I know
of all
right maybe we'll find out would you be
surprised to know that there are major
breakthroughs in Battery Technology no
really every day I tell you new ones
according to the brighter side of news
NASA has some big breakthrough they've
got a solid state sulfur selenium
battery that has the potential to
revolutionize the aviation
industry well there you
go I'm pretty sure that these drones are
electric powered but we'll talk about
that later
so so NASA has a big battery
breakthrough that'll be good for
aircraft meanwhile according to no Ridge
there's a there's a a zinc based battery
that's being developed Case Western
Reserve University made a breakthrough
now what would be special about a zinc
based battery is that it could be made
with all normal easy to find U minerals
so you wouldn't
minerals is that the right word but you
wouldn't need lithium and you wouldn't
need the hard to find stuff so those are
just two I think there was a third one
today now remember the reason I tell you
about this is not that these specific
breakthroughs are important what's
important to know is that this this
whole domain of battery storage is going
to go crazy I mean you know if any if
any of these breakthroughs work you're
doubling tripling quadrupling your
performance your batteries that changes
everything it it doesn't just give you a
little extra mileage in your electric
car
it allows you to you know power your
house without being connected to the
grid create all kinds of aircraft that
can fly with electricity alone uh it's a
big deal it's it would be a civilization
changing shift and there's no way it's
going to not happen meanwhile according
to uh
NDTV uh there's a new study that said
there might be so much hydrogen trapped
under the ground
that it could uh um could end the fossil
fuer era in other words
there's 26 times more of the hydrogen in
the underground than there is known oil
reserves there's only one problem so
we've got 26 times more of this energy
source than the one we
use problem is we don't know where it is
it's somewhere trapped in the planet now
how do they
know how much there is
and how do they know how much there is
if they don't know where it is do you
trust this I'm going to say on the
surface I do not trust the study that
says we know how much hydrogen is
underground we just don't know where it
is no thank
you nope nope not good
enough according to the hill small
business optimism jumped in November
surpassing a 50e average for the first
time blah blah blah now if you do not
follow
economics there are some numbers that
are far more important than
others and for example the stock market
is a little bit
interesting but it's not telling you too
much you know because there a lot of
animal instincts and some specific
companies might be driving the averages
and all that but when you see the small
business optimism up to a a high
historical High that's
meaningful that's really good news um
similar to employment you know if you
have good unemployment numbers you're
you're usually in good shape at least
you're not going to you know be
destroyed as a country you'll be able to
get through it as long as the employment
numbers are good so that's good another
great
news
um here's another big one according to
news Nation Texas is looking at a bill
legislation that would allow residents
to pay their Texas taxes in
Bitcoin so you could pay your taxes in
Bitcoin if this got passed now I don't
know if it'll get passed but here's what
you need to know about that if you're
wondering hey Bitcoin is not backed by
anything so I'm afraid to own
it Bitcoin if it becomes a way that you
can pay your taxes let's say federal
taxes more important than state taxes
but if the federal government and I
think Trump might actually do this Trump
might make this change um if you could
pay your federal taxes in Bitcoin which
is not on the table but I think it might
be um then you don't have to worry about
Bitcoin becoming
useless because it'll have something you
could buy that basically every person
wants to buy which is pay off their
taxes
so this this sounds like a little
technical thing it's like oh yeah taxes
might might let you pay in Bitcoin no
it's actually gigantic it's like a
civilization altering Trend not for just
the state if it's only Texas it's no big
deal but if the uh federal government
followed suit and other states said
bitcoin's here to stay and the people
who have invested in it probably be a
lot happier if they heard that happen
anyway JD Vance invited Daniel Penny the
Subway Hero I call him uh to the Army
Navy game with him and
Trump so how much do I love this a
lot uh this is exactly what I want my
president to do I want my president to
go to a b to a football game um
especially given this military nature of
the game Army Navy with the Marine vet
who was cleared in his case that's
exactly what I want I don't want Daniel
Penny just to break
even I want Daniel Penny to comeand
ahead that's what this is this is
somebody who stepped into help at Great
personal expense and risk you know he
didn't know about the expense part but
lawyers are not
cheap it's not good enough if we only
rehabilitate him back to where he was
that's not good enough no it's very
important to me that he comes on
ahe and having the president of the
United States say you want to go to a
Bas to a football game that's a start
but remember he's still getting
sued um civil by maybe the father or
somebody so he's going to have massive
bills and uh so we better look at look
at helping funding him I think there's a
one of those online funding things for
funding Daniel peny you could probably
find it if you Google it but make sure
you don't get a fake there's probably
some
fakes so that's
cool
um you want to talk about
drones half of you are sick of drones
and half of you think it's the most fun
thing happening I happen to be in the
category of people who think it's the
most fun thing happening because it's
just makes is so curious what's going on
so I've got a lot to say about it but
I'm going to answer some questions for
sure right so you're going to get some
answers today that uh I'm quite
confident about that maybe moves it a
little bit forward
okay
so here's where
we I'll give you there's a bunch of news
on this topic so Trump said the mystery
Jones sightings are all over the country
he said this on a post I'm true social
uh can this really be happening without
our government's knowledge I don't think
so all right so Trump believes that the
government knows what they are because
duh of course the government knows what
they are and he says uh let the public
know and now otherwise shoot them
down now there's no chance they're going
to be shot down by her government
because they belong to our government I
think that part that part we
know it is not aliens it's not another
country it's definitely us so I'm
willing to say that I'm willing to say
that with a 100% certainty for the first
time 100% certainty no doubt about it
it's us and presumably are military but
I would include you know if it's a CA
CIA testing something to me that's still
military
essentially so um Alex Jones did video
with a warning I'm not sure I fully
understand Alex Jones's point but the
the essence of it is that it might be
the drones are part of an
OP um that is setting up Trump for some
kind of emergency power takeover
situation so I don't know I don't know
how to connect the dots from the drones
to somebody trying to take create a
situation to take power from Trump that
would only make sense if we were
convinced the drones were not on our
side if we know the drones are on our
side it's not going to really cause any
kind of
panic and I'm here to tell you the
drones are on our
side I'll give you my complete certainty
of that and I I'll tell you more in a
minute but complete
certainty all right
um so news
Nation had one of their reporters uh
Rich McHugh
McHugh I saw Megan Kelly noted that he's
highly credible because the things he
says don't sound highly
credible if you just heard this and you
didn't know that he's actually a you
know a serious reporter and Megan Kelly
tells you yeah you can believe him U he
said this he went to New Jersey uh
admitted that he wasn't really quite a
believer that anything weird was going
on probably thought like a lot of you
it's just commercial airlines or regular
drones and you know people are imagining
what they're seeing but he says he gets
there to New Jersey I guess it was and
uh it blew his mind there were 40 to 50
of these
drones 40 to 50 of them that were sort
of simultaneously flying around 40 to
50 and he said that they don't have a
heat
signature so the government can't seem
to identify them by heat because they
seem designed that you can't get a heat
signature now that would suggest if this
is true and I'm not sure it is true that
they have no he signature but if it's
true it would
suggest military right you you would
assume it's a military operation if if
it's built to that kind of a that kind
of a specific
ations um he said they had their fixed
Wing devices and they're about 8
ft um he says the entire view of the New
Jersey drones has changed since he
witnessed them flying from the ocean so
there does seem to be continued reports
that the drones somehow are coming from
some ocean location now I've heard some
people in some videos suggest that they
were coming out of the
ocean I highly doubt they're coming out
of the
ocean but maybe I mean if we've
developed a submarine that can launch
drones maybe I just highly highly doubt
it what I think is happening is that the
drones maybe go Beyond the Horizon
because remember the the Earth is round
they go beyond your Horizon and then
just land on whatever military ship
launched them but and then they turn off
the lights so to you it looks like they
went in the ocean because it's too far
for you to see that they landed on a
ship so I think the reports of them
coming from the ocean and land going
back into the ocean probably all fake I
think it they're just landing on a ship
that's far away that's my guess and and
our military would be our
military
um let's see so they're uh they're lower
than normal and they're smaller than a
regular plane and it was very clear last
night and uh reportedly I'll tell you
more about that you can see everything
clearly so it was a really clear
night
um so rich said quote the experience I
had last night however changed the way I
feel about the story completely he said
what I saw was more sophisticated than I
ever
imagined uh we've been looking for the
past hour I think we've seen about 40 or
50 of these
drones now
here's where I get to do some fun
reporting I was doing a live stream last
night a private one on
locals and one of our uh most famous
members on the locals Community those
are people who subscribe just to see my
content privately is uh Erica and Erica
lives in New Jersey and of course we all
kept saying Erica why don't you take
your phone outside and take some
pictures
and last night Erica was doing just that
so so we got to hear from somebody we
know to be a real person and we know to
be straight shooter so we know that
whatever she was saying is definitely
true right because it's just somebody we
know and trust so Erica takes her phone
out and you can see I've uh I reposted
um some of the photos in my Stream So if
you can't find Erica
directly just go to mine Scott Adam says
and you'll see you'll see her ex account
as well but I reposted it
and and I saw some videos and some some
photos so let me tell you what I
saw um Erica's description if I have it
right is that they were the same as Rich
MC mchu that they were all over the
place they were really obviously
everywhere every time you went outside T
night it seems and that they were flying
over the residential areas one of the
videos I saw privately um you can see it
start as just a light in the distance
and this particular one went directly
over the home of the person who is
videoing it from the time it was just
the
light so you could see it as clearly
almost as the people standing on the
ground so here's what I here's what I
can tell you um based on Erica's report
in some of the pictures I saw number one
there's a sound to them that's not
common Aviation sound
now of course we can all be influenced
by you know persuasion we can talk
ourselves into hearing things we're not
hearing and stuff but Erica is very
reliable and says that the sound doesn't
match sort of normal Aviation sound
they're flying low they're not up
whereare regular air planes are
and um they definitely are going over
the residential areas commonly and you
can see them all over the place every
night now I watched as The Little Dot of
Light which from a distance I would have
called an
orb you've seen the UFO pictures they're
just a glowing
orb well these look like glowing orbs
just because they must have like a a
light on the front that's overwhelms the
other lights I guess because for a very
long time it looks like just a tiny
light that's becoming a larger light so
it can get pretty close to you and still
just look like an orb so my first my
first uh finding is that you could
imagine that at least some of the things
people who thought were
orbs might have been an airplane or one
of these drones or something I don't
think all of the orbs fell into the
pattern that they could have been this
but uh maybe some of them so then the uh
the craft gets so close to the person in
New Jersey who was videoing it that you
could kind of see that it was a fixed
Wing
Craft um I wouldn't be surprised if it
was you know this eight or 10 feet
wide and
loud
and probably oh and the other thing is
that according to Eric
they were hovering for long periods of
time uh out at Sea so when they came
over the residential area they weren't
doing so much hovering they were just
going somewhere but when they're on a
sea they seem to be hovering for as many
for as much as 15 minutes you know just
in
place
now you may have seen
uh somebody online that's getting passed
around said oh this is one of the
military's uh vertical takeoff and
Landing drones
and sure enough the the military you can
find it easily the military has a bunch
of drones that are vertical takeoff and
Landing meaning that they can hover but
they can also fly like a plane and they
have fixed wings so they're not drone
drones they're they're probably vertical
takeoff and Landing but smaller so they
might be drones meaning that they might
be unmanned but here's the next thing I
would like to add to the conversation
they were big enough that they could
have been
manned I don't know where we're getting
the idea that they're unmanned because
nobody has a clear shot of a
cockpit does anybody have a clear enough
picture from above it that you could say
for sure they're not manned like every
one of them not manned they're big
enough they're big enough that they
could be manned but uh the the drones
that were mentioned the ones that do
vertical takeoff and Landing they were
specific specifically for supplying
things or picking up things from land
and then moving it to a ship and sea and
vice versa so there were for quick
transport of heavy stuff but not super
heavy stuff it can't take a tank um from
from the water to the
Sea now New
Jersey has military bases on land and so
if you were going to to test this kind
of Technology you would put your boat in
the ocean and you would have many
flights in which these devices went from
your boat to a military
base did his thing and then went
back so probably that so I would say
that the the weight of uh reporting from
citizens and reporters who were not part
of the government seems to clearly
indicate the following number one
there's no UFO activity that anybody can
find so you can rule out
UFOs your government told you that
they're not um they're not foreign
actors they know that they're not
they're not guessing about that part if
you think they're
guessing when they say it's not foreign
adversaries they're not guessing they
absolutely know it's not so I wouldn't
worry about it don't worry about it at
least in terms of a foreign adversary
you might still worry about it for
different reasons you know Alex Jones
says she should worry about it and I
don't know about that so I'm just saying
that if you don't know what it is you
should you let's make sure we find out
uh next the fact that there's no
military presence that we can see that's
trying very hard to intercept them when
they're all over the place uh is really
all the confirmation you need to know
to know that our military knows what
they are because they're not looking for
them and they're really really really
easy to find like really easy to find
like you can just walk outside there's
one there's another one there's another
one now to be
fair some of them
are spottings of regular um
airplanes how do I know that that's
possible well during the live stream
in which the New Jersey ones were being
filmed and talked about I went outside
in my own house went out in the balcony
at night and sure enough there was a
drone and it was coming right at my
house and I'm like holy they're
everywhere what is this and I'm looking
at this thing and I'm I'm like
clearly this is not an air
aircraft this this is not normal
aircraft and it's like it's it's one of
these balls of light it's coming right
at my house gets closer and closer and
closer and then finally I could sort of
see its outline I'm like holy
 it looks just like a
drone and it's way too low and then it
got a little closer and I
said oh it's an
airplane I live near an airport uh I
live near a small airport where there
are lots of small planes it was just a
regular plane now was I convinced Beyond
any doubt that I was looking at
something unusual yes I
was for a moment I was 100% sure I was
looking at some
anomalous thing I'd never seen
before um yeah and it was it was much
higher higher in the sky but you
couldn't tell how high it was until it
got kind of
close so can a normal person who is
famously good at not being fooled by BS
be immediately fooled by a drone
yes yeah yes you can think that the
normal flights are drones so here's the
next thing I'm sure of so this next
thing I'm positive there are hobby
drones in the area this is confirmed by
reporting because people are bringing
their own drones to look for the other
things so there's definitely hobby
drones
100% some of the sightings are just
regular
aircraft uh I know this because Pilots
are having fun with it the pilots are
looking at the video and just laughing
and saying that's just an
airplane uh have you never seen an
airplane
before so I guarantee you some of the
spottings probably the ones that are in
other parts of the country or regular
drones or balloons or maybe a UFO or
something else so so the other thing I'm
sure of is that it's not
Nationwide but the the sightings are
nationwide it might be in more than one
place but it's definitely not Nationwide
whatever these things are it's just
somebody testing something it does not
seem to be Transportation as in the only
point is to bring a person from one
place to another doesn't seem to be that
uh it could be
Recreation but who has 40 or 50 friends
with flying
cars so I I would rule out
Recreation I think you could keep
testing and
surveillance um or maybe demonstrating
for the purpose of uh you know deciding
what to
procure um so I think it looked more
like testing
procurement
training something like that that's what
it
filing
um so Martha mcallum had John Kirby on
to ask about it and it's a real good
clip if you want to see a real good um
news person being lied to to her face
knowing that he's lying to her face and
not being willing to put up with it it's
it's a real good fun watch because
Martha Martha wasn't having it let's
just say that I won't describe it
further I'll just say Martha wasn't
having it she just wasn't having it and
it was fun to watch
now here's the fun
part we can learn how to spot
Lying by watching how the people you
know are lying are doing it now since
you know that the
um you know that our leaders are lying
right the lower level people are
probably not lying so a chief of police
not
lying uh a specific member of the let's
say uh police force not lying they're
just doing the best that they can to
tell you what's going on because they
don't know but do you think that the
National Security Communications adviser
Kirby John Kirby do you think he doesn't
know what it
is well he might not be fully
briefed but I guarantee he knows there
ours I guarantee it oh I mean I
guarantee
it so when you watch him talk about it
what you do is you look for how he talks
about it because that teaches you how
somebody lies because this is one of
those rare situations where you don't
have to wonder if they're lying oh
they're definitely lying
so what uh Kirby
says
um what did he say he said uh
that the ones that they had looked
into um were just regular commercial
aircraft do you know what he's leaving
out well how many have you looked into
and does that mean you've ruled out no
it's sort of a weasel answer all the
ones we've looked at you know check down
as regular
aircraft that's a weasel answer
right that's so obviously a weasel
answer or or why doesn't
you know why doesn't the military shoot
one down or why don't we know why why
with all of our Advanced mil assets why
don't we know like he can't answer these
questions obviously he knows the answer
he just can't answer them but then
mayorcas was the funniest
one he said that Homeland Security he
told the CNN's Wolf Blitzer that's his
Agency quote has seen no evidence of
anomalous
activity do do you think mayorcas knows
what's going on of course he does yeah
mayorcas would knows exactly what's
going on do you think that when mayorcas
is so specific that they've seen no
anomalous
activity what do you think is anomalous
to somebody who knows what's going on if
you knew what was going on and you knew
that the military test things because of
course everybody tests everything then
it's not anomalous is
it it's not anomal at all so you look
for the specific words and how narrow
they make their
statements uh know that drone that
somebody reported on Tuesday at 2 o'cl
over New Jersey uh we determined that
was an
aircraft oh that's but what about the
other ones H that's very specific John
Kirby so you can learn a lot about how
people lie this week it's going to be
fun
all
right in other news there's a daily
wirers reporting that there was a school
in Wisconsin that denied a white student
uh help in his reading because he wasn't
a
minority so they're getting
sued it makes me
happy it does make me think that things
are starting to move in the right
direction um then according to Fox News
uh there was a scholarship program that
discriminated against white
men and uh where was this
uh where were
these um I did not write where these
were but there were two scholarship
programs for something in the in the
medical domain to go to college and uh
they're getting sued because the program
was for everybody but white men
basically
so that's happening but separately
you've already heard some uh some of
this but van Jones continues to
be really fun to watch as he's trying to
inform other Democrats what they did
wrong because I think he's he's pretty
close to figuring it out as I thought he
would
be unlike most of the other other
Democrats who have decided that what
went wrong is that there must be more
racist in the country than they knew
about that that's the lowest level of
understanding or maybe kamla Harris
wasn't the best campaigner maybe that's
why maybe
um but van Jones pointed out on uh some
video I was watching he was in some
event talking about it
and he noted that the Democrats had
created these binaries as he called them
as opposed to being like Martin Luther
King who would say how about everybody's
good so there's no binary with Martin
Luther King oh you're a human being oh
you're
good do I have to do anything else no
what you said you're a human being right
yes you're good you're a human being yes
you get full respect full rights because
you're a human being
but the Democrats didn't do that rather
as van Jones pointed out even uh Bernie
Sanders who van loves uh was
billionaires are bad and Van says but is
Oprah bad now that wasn't the best
example given recent events because she
did attend some Diddy parties if you
know what I mean but we don't know that
she's bad so his point is billionaires
aren't bad just because they're
billionaires
that's not the way to do it it's you
know you you're not being honest with
the public basically if you say
billionaires are bad and other people
are good um then of course the the
bigger issue of
Dei is a killer and uh he does seem to
note that as long as the Democrats have
divisive uh communication and
policies they don't really have a chance
of winning because Trump managed to to
put together
a uh let's say a uh a set of ideas that
are Beyond more than anything they're
about Unity you know make America Great
America America close the borders you
know he's pretty clear about what's
going on um van Jones also said it's
funny that he was saying like he was
just figuring it out that the mainstream
news is now The Fringe and what had been
The Fringe is now the mainstream news so
as he points out everybody knew that Joe
Rogan was big so that was no surprise
but they were there were lesser known to
older people lesser known podcasters
that Trump somehow
found through Baron I think and
exploited and that that was a big deal
and that the Democrats haven't wrapped
their head around the fact that CNN
might pull in you know several hundred
thousand viewers where the the teenage
podcaster is pulled in 14
million so they're not even close it's
not that one overtook the other they're
not even close the the alternative news
and opinion people are just absurdly
bigger than the mainstream media now so
they're aware of
that and Van also said that they're
vague messaging about things like
they're going to restored
democracy wasn't really hitting anybody
you know in the heart or the pocketbook
where they care about stuff so the vague
generalities he didn't say stop saying
everybody's a racist but that was sort
of implied
too um so that's
interesting
and we'll see if the Democrats can
recover I don't think they
can I I don't think there's any way to
recover do
you what would it
take I don't know Federman is
interesting though because if he is
becomes a candidate he could actually
maybe reframe things we'll
see meanwhile uh the post Millennium
says that uh Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg
and Sam mman have all donated a million
dollars each to Trump's inauguration
fund it does sound a little bit like a
Shakedown doesn't it if the inauguration
fund comes to your
company and you're like uh I don't want
to say no to the inauguration fund
because for a million dollars which is
kind of
cheap uh wouldn't it be better to show
that we're in favor of the democratic
process you know if not the candidate
himself so that was smart to me it's
like they're buying
protection um but uh I saw a clip by
Mark andreon who was pointing out and
Elon Musk was agreeing that we've never
seen a VI shift like this something that
happened very fast and quite thoroughly
and sort of changed all the way we feel
and think about everything it really did
the the vibe shift is continuing I worry
that it might be temporary and you know
just had something to do with the
election being recent but it looks like
it's real like I think the Daniel Penny
thing helped you know make us feel like
oh common sense is returning and that
those two words common and
sense I believe are the unifying words
for the country because what was
happening is in order for the two sides
to show that they were different from
each other they had to disagree on
everything it seems like there was some
Unwritten rule that the parties had to
just disagree on everything but there
were so many things that were common
sense that you didn't really need to
disagree on such as borders
you know I'm sure a majority of
Democrats would like the Border
controlled you know
so the common sense turns out to be and
you know nobody really I don't think
there was a champion for that term or
anything it's just that people
simultaneously decided why don't we just
do what's common sense why don't we just
stop assuming that we figure this out
stop assuming that our leaders are
smarter than us why we just look look at
what makes sense and I'll bet there's no
difference when the Republicans and the
Democrats look at Common Sense stuff and
sure enough I think there are things
such as the Daniel peny situation I
think Common Sense
screams that you need to protect the the
guy who was willing to step in
especially a a marine are you kidding me
like we train him to do this and then
we're going to put him in jail for doing
it he's trained to do that you know I
realize you know went wrong but he's
trained to he's trained to step
in meanwhile the Harvard U president
according to the New York Post privately
told his faculty members that they need
to uh work on their messaging they have
to rethink their messaging after the GOP
Victory now here's what I love about
that every time some
democrat says they have to change their
messaging it confirms to me that they
don't understand anything that's happen
happening in the world you're
messaging not really the base
problem yes you're messaging should be
better but it's not the base problem the
base problem is the things you're
talking about don't make Common
Sense either bad for Unity bad for the
economy bad for the future in some way
so no it's not your messaging that's the
problem and everybody who thinks they're
messaging in the problem probably
narcissists who can't who can't look at
their own actions and see anything wrong
it's like huh must be other people it's
just a messaging this
wrong anyway I think they're still
trapped in their own gaslighting
bubble meanwhile in California um a
member of the California legislature is
being accused by the Department of
Justice for may be taking bribes related
to permits for uh cannabis
and you don't need to know the details
that's not the important part but here's
here's a problem I
have I feel like our elected leaders are
the least qualified and trustworthy for
deciding anything that involves
money I feel I feel like the people we
elect should have no control over money
like who gets a permit so they can open
a business who gets the bid I don't
think they should do it because all it
does is create uh guaranteed corruption
at every
level so somebody has to make the
decisions and whoever is making
decisions it would be susceptible to
bribery but I feel like everything that
has to do with money needs to be really
really public and transparent so at
least the public can say hey hey I think
you know somebody and that permit is bad
and so other than making everything
super
public uh I don't know what to do about
that there there's no way that local
management can ever work because they're
just too easily
bribable meanwhile the unit the United
healthc Care CEO I don't know is he the
one who replaced the one who was
murdered he must be but he said uh quote
we know the health system does not work
as well as it should and we understand
people's frustration with it the new
CEO's last name is
witty he's a witty
guy um he but here's the important part
he said no one would design a system
like the one we have and no one did it's
a patchwork built over decades now who
can fix that if you have a system that's
a patchwork that really needs to be
ripped down to its you know its base and
rebuilt to make sense
Elon Musk now I don't know if he's going
to be working specifically in this
domain but
yes our Health Care system is one nobody
would have designed so what if you said
to
yourself what would it look like if the
smartest person in the world designed
it why don't we see if we can get there
and if we can't do it well we're
dead so that would be called
re-engineering so instead instead of
tweaking you start and say all right
everything's on the table you what if we
could just throw away everything we have
start over what would it look like if we
did it right and that would take your
health care cost down probably 50% I
think that's what I
think anyway um here's a scary one there
was a young man 26y old guy who uh was
found dead from what they think he
suicide in San Francisco in his
apartment but what's interesting is that
he was a former open AI you know chat
GPT open AI researcher but he turned
whistleblower so he was an open AI
whistleblower who was found suspiciously
dead and he was whistleblowing because
uh he was uh he thought it was too
dangerous or they're doing it too fast
or something he was a subject of a New
York Times oh no he was a subject I'm
sorry it wasn't because of the danger
only but he was a subject of a New York
Times
profile uh that quoted him as open AI
was stealing the IP of places like the
New York Times now if it turned out that
the law agreed with the New York
Times that AI can't just use their
stuff that would make AI kind of
worthless so let me let me put this
together so there was a
whistleblower whose opinion could make a
$3 trillion industry go away just go
away because it couldn't do what it does
if it couldn't use stuff is scraped off
the
internet now he becomes a whistleblower
which is a risk to $3 trillion business
bu and
then without any outside knowledge he
dies suspiciously
of what I guess would be a drug overdose
intentionally if they think it's
suicide but wouldn't that be the easiest
thing to
fake like if you had a pill that was
going to kill somebody you know let's
say you know you knew it would kill him
and you just put a put a gun in head and
say take this pill and lay
down would they do it and then the pill
just kills them and then you think it's
suicide so if it weren't for the fact
that the industry is so big
that that you don't know what they'd be
willing to do to keep a trillion dollars
going their way I don't know I the smart
money says that it was just something
about him but on the other hand we have
heard that the intelligence agencies
have told the big AI companies that
they're going to be the the of
the intelligence people in other words
the government has already told them
there are only going to be two or three
big AI companies because we can't
control them if there are lots of them
and we're going to totally control them
to make sure that it's all stuff that's
good for the republic or maybe good for
the Democrats I don't know but uh if you
imagine that the intelligence
people know that our AI industry has to
be better than China's or else we'll all
die do you think the CIA could let
somebody blow the whistle and destroy a
trillion dollar industry in America
while China would just keep going and
reportedly they've already caught up
with us uh even though they have worse
chips somehow they've already caught up
and the risk to the United States as a
country might be
existential so the smart people are
saying if we don't win in AI we don't
win that's like going to be the whole
game I I don't know that that's true but
it's a reasonable risk and it's a
reasonable thing to say so now it's
trillions of dollars it's an existential
risk to the country and there's this one
whistleblower who might blow
everything and the people who are trying
to make sure that it doesn't get blown
up are literally trained
Killers they're trained killers and
trained
liars and then somebody suspiciously
dies he suspiciously dies after he
crosses a trillion dollar industry full
of trained Killers not full of but but
backed by backed by trained
Killers now if you're not worried about
that I don't know what you're worried
about
now I'm not going to make any
accusations like I don't I don't have
direct evidence of anything happening
but boy everything about it raises some
questions
um Scott Jennings summed up who was on
CNN he he summed up the reason for
Trump's political comeback in just three
words according to the Daily wire he he
called them the breaker of
narratives how do you like that
explanation of why Trump won he's a
breaker of
narratives I accept that but I would add
a couple of
tweaks you don't break
narratives unless you have persuasion
skills what Trump has is the persuasion
skills so I would have said he won
because he's the most skilled
Persuader um but if you don't want to
talk in Persuasion terms you'd say he's
a breaker of Nar narratives which in
fact he did one of the narratives was
that the fake news was
reliable and he just changed the
narrative to nope it's always lying all
the time and we go oh okay that's that's
really different he changed the
narrative from he was a clown to he's
maybe the best president we've ever
had but here's the other thing I would
add you had some
help yes Trump trump is the boss in this
example he's the boss and when the boss
gets good advice the boss still has to
decide to take it so the boss has to
know who to listen to the boss has to
know which advice is good because
there's lots of competing advice and
then they have to take that advice and
productively use it so no matter who
helps Trum the boss gets all the credit
it should be that way that's the way it
should be so
so but the truth is he had a lot of
help Trump had a lot of help and there
were a lot of really really persuasive
people who helped him pushed him over
the the line um I'm talking about people
like David Sachs uh Elon
Musk uh
vake those are not ordinary persuasive
people those are super super
persuasive and so if those are the
people that Trump listens to and we know
he
did There's how you break a narrative
but also people like uh Mike
cernovich breaker of narratives people
like me breaker of
narratives um I don't see that kind of
skill on the left maybe I just don't
know who the players are enough that's
possible but on the
right it's no surprise that the boss of
a group of people who for whatever
reason have the best narrative Breakers
all in the same
team he's a narrative breaker but he got
help so and and is and again he still
gets all the credit because probably all
of this help would have been available
to a Democrat you know different people
but maybe there's a Democrat who wasn't
taking advice didn't know which advice
to
take
yeah and it does seem that the Democrats
are makers of narratives I'm seeing that
from Frank makers of narratives so the
the Democrats make the narrative and
Trump is the first person at that level
of politics who was able to destroy them
and just turn them
around I take you back to
2015 when I said uh you guys don't know
what's
coming I've never seen anybody with more
persuasion Tools in their toolbox he's
not going to change just politics I told
you in
2015 I said he's going to change reality
itself and that's the breaker of
narratives here it
is meanwhile Jordan Peterson is moving
to the US I've been waiting for this I I
kind of every time Peterson would
complain about Canada because Canada is
giving him a hard time and his
licensing uh the taxes are high and the
government's incompetent and you know
immigration's out of control there as
well and they're super woke I kept
thinking you going to move right like
why wouldn't you move he probably does
most of his work in America so he just
announced he's moving now I think maybe
at least half of his reason is to be
closer to his daughter who he works with
a lot too she's already in the United
States so welcome Jordan Peterson you
know we we always mock uh all the
Democrats who say if Trump is elected
I'm immediately leaving the country and
then they never
do then Jordan Peterson says oh you went
too far and now I'm leaving your country
imagine losing Jordan Peterson from
Canada do you know what Canada just
lost they just lost their best
guy if you were going to pick
teams for some kind of competition that
was academic or mental or persuasion or
just good advice or a good writer you
you look at Canada you say all right
who's the second best
Canadian I don't know who's the second
best Canadian they just lost their best
Canadian but it's an honest question
who's their second best like if you'd
ask me I I think Gad sad is is the the
right answer to that yeah
gadad but is he still in is Gad still in
Canada oh Mark Stein he got shot down I
haven't heard from him in a long time
tan
akroy Mark
gresy Mike Meyers well I think of the
names that you mentioned
Jordan Peterson would still be the first
one picked for any team so they lost
their best guy good good luck
Canada
anyway according to European commission
joint Research Center um when people
engage with social media in other words
they make comments as opposed to just
reading it they feel less
lonely but if they simply consume it
passively they feel more lonely
or at least there's a difference in
loneliness so um I'm going to make a
recommendation to you a recommendation
if you're looking to interact with your
social media but you don't feel like
talking to
people um I'm not I don't have any
financials take in this in case you
wonder but
perplexity the app you really need to
try this
one it's the first AI related app that
I'm pretty sure I'll use always you know
unless somebody beats it but right now
it's killer and what it is is you can
just hold down the little button and
talk to it and because it's AI you can
say anything unclearly and is still
seems to understand everything and then
it gives just the best answers so I'll
give you an example of what I asked at
yesterday so I I like it I like to have
it talk to me about things I didn't know
that are just quick so I said tell me a
story about something that happened in
American history that is interesting and
most people don't know about and then it
told me you know I promp kept prompting
it it gave me three different stories
that were really interesting I I was
totally delighted to get them and they
were right on point there were
interesting things that I didn't know
about for example did you know that
Davey
Crockett was not born in one of the
United
States
apparently there was a brief period
where there was some other
Breakaway area where he lived that had
there was named
Franklin so that they tried to make a
state I think it was in the Kentucky
Tennessee area wherever it was they
tried to create a new state called
Franklin so he was actually born and
grew up in the of Franklin that doesn't
even
exist that was kind of cool and anyway
had a few other stories but the what it
does is it'll it'll go on for a while
without being annoying and tell you a
fun story or so I use it all day long
every I use it when I'm
working um for example this morning when
I heard those noises and then I saw the
alert about the tornado alert in San
Francisco
I just reach to perplexity I push the
button and they say what does a tornado
sound
like and it comes back with and it comes
back with you know it can sound like a
freight
Trin and I think exactly exactly so
that's probably what I
heard so it's really good and it will
feel like a person talking to you so it
will make you feel a little less lonely
because you're interacting with it so
that is my advice on that the last thing
last point is uh there was a study new
study by the University of Manchester
about Russia's covert propaganda Network
so apparently when they lost uh RT so
that doesn't run in the United States
because that was there RT was called
Russia Today originally and it was a
meant to be a propaganda tool but it's
kind of banned in United States um but
they launched a bunch of other smaller
ones to make them look like they were
real real news sites but here's listen
to this one of their real news sites is
called reliable recent news or as they
call it
rrn rrn is literally the name of my
comic strip that I do only within the
locals Subscription Service uh which
involves a robot who reads the news so
rrn as a news entity is it's comic but
it's also a Russian site I guess anyway
so the uh they did they did this study
and they found out that the Russian
propaganda is absolutely toothless
useless and makes no difference
whatsoever now that is what I've been
telling you since
2016 when we saw the Russian memes
remember the Democrats were saying no
the Russians are posting all these
things on social media and it's fixing
the it's rigging the result and then
they showed us what their memes were and
the memes looked like they were made by
seventh graders as a project didn't have
any any persuasive qualities
whatsoever all right Ryan Reynolds I
guess that's our most famous current
Canadian all right I'll give you Ryan
Reynolds he's a billionaire that that
might be that might be beating Jordan
Peterson all right
that's all I got for you today it's
going to be a wonderful day um I believe
Owen is going to do a spaces after this
so he's going to test to see if anybody
wants to hang around and keep talking
people uh people who follow me so look
for
Owen um he'll have a spaces probably
he's probably getting ready to fire that
up pretty soon uh if you want to
continue all right
so that's all I got for today I will see
you in the man cave tonight but I'm
going to say just a little bit privately
to the locals people before I go so
goodbye to YouTube and Rumble and x and
locals I'm coming at
you
