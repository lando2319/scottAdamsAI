hey everybody come on in here
it's time yeah it's time for a coffee
with scott adams
what a great day this is yes
and you're all here for it which i think
is pretty pretty special
and here's a philosophy question for you
which
might have some practicality in your
real life
hypothetically if somebody invented a
button
that you could push and it would make
your life substantially better
would you push it in the comments tell
me
if if you know this for sure and there's
no trick to it
right there's no trick there's a button
if it existed and you pushed it
it would make your life better with no
downside
would you push it well let's find out
because there's a little button on the
bottom of your screen called
notifications
and if you were to push that button at
the same time as you did the
simultaneous sip
it would make your life better and
that's a promise
but if you'd like to fully enjoy pushing
that button and having the simultaneous
sip
at the same time you need a couple of
marker glasses to take your chelsea
stein canteen junk flask vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the turbo
simultaneous sip which comes with a
button press for some of you
subscription button too that works
go
ah it was as good as i told you wasn't
it
yeah it was
all right now let's talk about the news
i guess the tiger woods uh cause of his
crash will
be revealed today or tomorrow
do you believe that so the news says
that we will know the result of the the
cause of the tiger woods crash
i'm going to say that's not going to
happen
and what i mean is there will be a
report
but i feel like we're going to look at
that report and we're going to say
something like this
maybe maybe not
do you do you really think we're going
to find the cause of the crash
and that tiger will say oh yeah that was
the cause
and and you'll look at it you'll say
yeah that looks about right
i don't see anything left out seems like
all of the context is there
i don't feel like that's going to happen
but we'll see
apparently there are a couple of uh
suspected terrorists who were on the
list
came over the southern border
well um i don't know how many suspected
terrorists come over the southern border
but
two is way too many it's way too many
now what i don't know
is if border security could ever stop
terrorists
i don't know i feel i feel like
terrorists would just find some other
way to do it
you know there must be a way to get into
the country so i think the border wall
has a lot more
to do with immigration in general and
probably has
a little limited value for stopping
terrorists but it's part of the story
there's a different level of motivation
for the terrorists and there are fewer
of them so it seems like they could get
across no matter what
but it's part of the story now now
here's
uh i would like to talk about things
i've been right about lately
do you remember that i predicted that
biden would be forced
to beef up security at the border
no matter what he wanted to do no matter
what philosophically he thought was
right
he was going to kind of have to keep
building it and apparently that's been
announced but they're going to play it
down because he's just going to fill in
the gaps
no no no we're not building a wall
that's crazy talk
we're filling in the gaps do you know
what the trump administration
was doing fill it in the gaps
that's what they were doing because the
gaps are exactly where you would put a
wall first
would you put a wall where there's
already a perfectly good wall
or would you put a wall in a part of the
border where nobody was crossing anyway
no you would put the wall where the gaps
are
the gaps that might actually be used for
crossing
so it's sounding suspiciously like
exactly the same policy
uh in in effect not in the details but
in effect
as uh trump who told you that was gonna
happen
i did now a fun story
there's a new study that said exhaled
aerosols
increases with coven-19 infection age
and obesity
so if you're old and overweight you're
more of a super spreader
at least in in the specific sense of
exhaling more virus
now this is just one study how often
does
one study turn out to be right i don't
know but i think the best part of this
story is where this study was
published it was published in a
publication
whose initials are p-n-a-s
that's right how do you pronounce that
acronym do you think people try to
pronounce it
p n a s
how would you pronounce that
penis sounds like penis
so there's a gigantic penis
study about aerosols um
i'm not going to say that i'm
necessarily right about that but i feel
like i'm
creeping toward being right that the
super spreaders are the older obese
people
and wouldn't it have been nice for our
medical experts to tell us that so we
knew
especially who to stay away from
and don't tell me that we were doing
social isolating in general so that
covered everything
because it doesn't you don't try exactly
as hard in every situation
but if you told me you know kids under
12 totally safe
and people over 50 with more weight
not so safe i would definitely act
differently
i wouldn't treat them the same
well here's another something else i was
sort of right about i said that in the
george floyd trial
they should put video evidence on trial
in general
not just the video evidence for this
case but they should make the larger
point
the video evidence is misleading
commonly commonly misleading
and the defense did that
put an expert on the stand who was
looking at where the knee was placed
on top of george floyd where the
officer's knee was
and the i guess the defense
nelson asked as one of the
witnesses if he'd ever heard of uh i
think his
camera bias or something like that and
the witness said no
and then he showed him side by side
pictures one at one that looked like the
knee was on the neck
and one that looked like he was on the
shoulder blades and it's the same
time and i guess there were multiple
pictures
that make that here
excuse me allergies are kicking my ass
today
anyway um so
in a way the defense did put video
evidence
in general on trial exactly right
because you have to get the jury to the
place where they would at least
at least imagine the video evidence
could be real
now it probably would have been a great
distraction to bring in these examples
that i'd mentioned like the fine people
oaks and
the bleach hoax because the people in
the in the jury probably believe those
things to be true
so they wouldn't work as examples even
though they're not true
so i think nelson did exactly right he
used exactly the camera angle
that was relevant to the case he made
the larger point that it's
not only is it possible but to be fooled
by video but there's a word for it
have i told you that when there's a word
for it
um it carries more weight we're more
persuaded
we're more persuaded uh
somebody's calling me a super spreader
on here which is pretty funny
um you never know but i i've had so
little contact with humans that i doubt
it
all right um did you know that the greg
gottfeld show is
five days a week at night it's competing
in the
11 p.m slot in the east coast and 8pm
on my coast
and apparently the first night of
ratings for the gutfeld show
how do you think he did on the first
night on the first night he beat
all the other shows at the at the 11
o'clock
uh thing now it's a little bit of apples
and oranges because
guffield runs at two times but
apparently he's already dominating
you know technically he's dominating
late night on the first night
second night was last night and by the
way if you haven't seen the clip
that's a parody of cnn coverage
it's really good it was on the first
night
so watch that
somebody alerted me actually a few
people alerted me to
uh the fact that ron desantis has
apparently adopted the trump
body language you know this you talk
like this
you know you've seen it and
when i first heard it i thought well it
doesn't look i'm sure it doesn't look
exactly like trump it probably looks you
know maybe reminds you of it but
and then i looked at it it's exactly
it looks like i mean i can't explain why
but it looks like actually an imitation
of trump is so is so spot-on with the
hand movements
and trump's hand movements were very
distinct i've never seen
i don't think i've seen anybody do it
before so i have to ask
is that intentional is it
and would you even practice that stuff
would you would you do those
hand motions like this would those be
the ones you do
i'm actually a little confused because i
i thought it would be sort of obvious
whether he was doing it intentionally or
not and i can't tell
i just can't tell it could it could
literally just be influence and he
picked it up and he doesn't know why
so we'll keep an eye on that
somebody smart has suggested that ron
desantis should lower his
speaking voice to have more authority
what do you think of that idea what do
you think of that
of desantis lowering his voice just a
little bit
to get a little more weight
if he could do it it'd be good um it
might be hard to pull off
and i think the same
suggestion there was a suggestion that
he's speaking from his uh
diaphragm which makes him sound a little
less leaderly
and he should be speaking from you know
the bottom of his stomach instead of the
the tight part
so i do think that he would benefit from
voice
the little voice technique and there is
technique in voice
one of the i've taught you this before
if you'd like a really quick technique
to tune your voice you hum the first
part of happy birthday
you hum it and you feel it in your the
what's called the mask of your face the
the front part and if you can hum so it
vibrates in the front
part of your face then you stop humming
the very next thing you speak
will be closer close to your perfect
speaking voice
all right so i'll give you a
demonstration goes like this you would
go
and now my voice would be just about my
perfect speaking voice because it tunes
me
and it relaxes me puts the voice up in
the right
mechanism so i think ron desantis could
benefit from a five-minute voice lesson
really we'll see
um and by the way i'd like to thank all
the people who send me
suggestions and and stuff because it
really helps
and that was a good suggestion so
rasmussen is reporting that
ask the question do you trust political
news you are getting
now here's one of the reasons that you
can't do polling questions
meaning unless you're trained at it it's
really hard to ask a question
that doesn't get a misleading answer you
know that people interpret differently
i was looking at this question it's a
simple question do you trust
the political news you were getting and
if they had not added the you are
getting at the end of that
it would completely change it because
trusting that all the news is accurate
is different from
trusting that the news you choose to
consume is accurate
because that's your choice to consume it
so
uh liberals had 55 percent
said they do not trust the political
news they are getting
i'm sorry i'm sorry 55 percent of
liberals
do trust the political news they're
getting
what do you think of that you would have
to be asleep
for years to trust the news wouldn't you
even your own news even the news that
you've decided is
the best of the best wouldn't you have
to be asleep for years to think that's
true
even if you said the honest mistakes
happen even the honest mistakes listen
let's say if you believed that the
russia collusion thing was an honest
mistake by the news
even if you believe there was honest
mistake it's still misleading
why would you trust it how in the world
can 55
of liberals have that opinion like what
what reality are they experiencing
conservatives uh we're at 23
and i'm gonna ask the same question
what 23 percent of conservatives
failed to notice the fake news
or or do they trust it anyway even
knowing that often is fake
how in the world could you be a
self-identified conservative
watching presumably at least some
conservative
coverage and still thinking you could
trust the news
where do they find this do you remember
i told you that on any poll question
something like 25 percent of the public
will just have a whack
response it will just look like they're
not even human beings if they can answer
that way
here's another example like who are
these 23 percent
i don't know if you would ever meet
anybody like that
if you spend your whole life do you
think you'll ever meet somebody
who says yeah i'm a conservative and you
know what the news is pretty accurate
do you have you ever met anybody 23
is enough that you would have met
somebody with that
opinion wouldn't you so here's the
problem i think some people just
interpret the question
differently if you said to a bunch of
conservatives do you trust the political
news you are getting
i believe that 23 percent probably
thought you know i can't read their
minds of course but probably something
like
23 well the conservative news that i
choose to follow is the good stuff
yeah they could get it wrong but you
know i trust them in general
so i think maybe that's just a question
interpretation issue
um so let's talk about the floyd trial
so as of today there's really no chance
he's going to get convicted of murder
i don't know if there's some lesser
charge but based on the testimonies and
the trial
facts that came out yesterday the odds
of a conviction
of derek shaven in my opinion have
reached
zero actually zero like you could say
well anything's possible but
i don't know in this case it just became
so clear and i'll run you through some
of the things
now what do you think of cnn reported
when the minneapolis police use of force
expert the actual training expert
this is the guy who trains the police on
use of force
and how did cnn cover that testimony
they said that this fellow testified
that derek shaven's
kneeling on george floyd's neck is not a
trained
neck restraint technique and that's what
they reported
do you think that covered it did
do you think anything was left out do
you think cnn
got everything you needed to know about
that situation right now
right in that headline right because it
kind of sounds if you read that
that doesn't make any sense when i just
told you there's zero chance he's going
to get convicted
right and somebody's
somebody in the comments is saying same
on abc news maybe
probably now let me tell you what
actually happened
now the only reason i know what actually
happened is that i'm reading the
uh i'm reading a blog site called
legal insurrection and andrew brenca
is live blogging this and gives him the
details
now if you read what actually happened
at the trial it's
closer to the opposite of what cnn
reported
because this use of force training guy
absolutely destroyed the narrative
here's how you get two different stories
when the prosecution is is talking to
this uh
use of force expert they narrow the
question so narrow
that the use of force guy is answering
on a sort of hypothetical
technical way so one of the questions
and this this is a general example right
this might be a little off but the
general example would be this
expert do you think that
um is it appropriate to continue
applying force
when the when the risk has passed
what would the expert say is it
appropriate to continue
applying this hold when the when the
danger has passed
how would he answer well i imagine he'd
answer
if there's no danger then you do not use
a
an aggressive hold right and that's
you know i'm i'm paraphrasing here but
basically that's what happened
but then the defense says and again i'm
paraphrasing lots of stuff into into a
little
summary then the defense says well is
every situation the same
no can you factor in this
the whole situation yes
if you factor in the whole situation
did derek shaven do anything against
policy
nope no
the guy who trains it the main guy who
trains the police
says that if you consider all the all of
the variables
he followed procedure that's the end of
the case
oh it's worse the medical professional
even did more so here let me just run
through and this is
most of this is cribbed from the legal
insurrection blog
which i recommend for the best thorough
look at this
uh what did i tell you about the drug
dealer
so floyd had a drug dealer who provided
him the drugs
and apparently the autopsy showed that
floyd had three times the amount
that might be enough for an overdose
three times
and i told you that that seems like a
third degree murder charge
could be applied to the dealer and i
recommended that the defense
you know try to get that going because
if somebody else is being tried for the
same murder
that's kind of some reasonable doubt
isn't it if two people are being tried
for the same murder for different
circumstances
at the same time how in the world can
one of them
find him guilty that's the most
reasonable doubt you could ever have
well it turns out that the uh the lawyer
for the drug dealer
has testified that he's going to take
the fifth and not
not talk at trial because it might
incriminate him in a
possible third degree murder which
apparently
is a thing in minneapolis yes
so for all of you people who said scott
scott scott
you seem to know absolutely nothing
about the law because it would be
ridiculous
to charge the drug dealer for the death
otherwise all the ods in the country
would be somebody to be getting charged
with the death
to which i said i don't think you quite
know what fentanyl is
fentanyl is not comparable to heroin
heroin some dangerous stuff but it's not
even close
fentanyl is way more dangerous
so if you're a dealer and you give
somebody fentanyl
and they die that's different because
you kind of should have
expected it or at least the the risk of
it was high enough
that you have some legal culpability
so the the scott adams non-lawyer theory
that the
that the drug dealer should be on trial
for third degree
murder is confirmed
it is confirmed doesn't mean he'll be
found guilty or even tried
but it's confirmed that it's a real
thing and that the circumstances
completely justify it in my opinion
all right as
andrew brenka said if you're looking at
two possible causes of death
and this is the way he he laid it out i
thought it was a real good way to lay
down
he said certainly if i had to choose
between two situations
one in which i was placed in a prone
position
while handcuffed for 10 minutes and i
had i think you'd have to assume that
you know there's a knee on you as well
and another in which i was forced to
ingest
a three-fold fatal dose of fentanyl
i know which i'd pick and quickly
there's simply no
reasonable comparison between those two
risks of life
you get that right putting somebody in a
police hold
that is an approved police hold
according to the person who teaches it
versus hey i could do this to you
or i could ask you to voluntarily take
three times the lethal dose
of fentanyl which would you choose it's
not even close
not even close no reasonable person
would think those risks are in the same
universe really one has a high risk of
killing you like really high
and the other would be sort of a
surprise
not even close
all right let's go on um
and uh andrew branca called the
the prosecution's case basically a train
wreck of a disaster
which is a pretty strong statement from
somebody who knows what they're talking
about
so the training guy was asked
if he himself had ever disbelieved a
suspect's claim
of a medical emergency because that's a
big part of the case
that floyd himself was saying he had a
medical emergency
essentially and the expert answered that
he
personally had done so disbelieved
somebody so it is a routine thing
to disbelieve somebody saying that they
have medical problems when they're
when they're being held by police is
routine
or at least common enough that this
guy's seen it as well
um so that tears
apart that part and and it even gets i'm
not even getting to the good stuff yet
like of how bad the case is at this
point um
so let's see uh
and and also um the uh
the police procedures um demonstrated
that chauvin putting his knee
on the person was the reason that it's
allowed
is that it's the least um it's the least
dangerous thing to do
that in other words given the totality
of the situation which included
um i guess shaven had called in at one
point and said that there might be this
delirium tremens or whatever there is
some medical situation they suspected
that floyd was in
in which his very large um body and
muscles
combined with the fact that he had some
mental
thing going on that may have been drug
related
if you have that much strength and
you're on some drugs and having a
reaction
that makes you unpredictable you can't
even control yourself
it turns out that the safest thing to do
is what derek shaven did it was the
safest thing to do
according to the procedures do you
excited delirium thank you
excited delirium is the the phrase now
do you get convicted for murder by being
reckless
when the police who train this technique
say that he used the right procedure
and it was the least dangerous thing he
could have done under the circumstances
the case is over the case is completely
over
i i don't know if there's any precedent
for this but it feels like the the jury
should just send everybody home
and say look we don't even need a trial
because there's no evidence been
presented that has any weight at all
now i don't think that's a thing but
should be
all right um let's see uh
and then the other factor which you and
i and common sense
already knew is that the expert said
that
if a sus if a suspect had been forcibly
resisting
the officers only only mormonts before
it wouldn't matter so much that he
looked even unconscious
because specifically the expert was
asked
even if he's unconscious should you
remove the restraint and the answer was
no
because there's enough of cases where
people pop awake
fighting and if somebody as big as floyd
and with whatever was happening to him
mentally with the drugs or whatever
if he were to pop back to consciousness
which is a thing
apparently it happens often enough that
the police are
trained to what to do about it because
he could have popped back awake
it was proper to keep him keep him down
in the in that position
i mean what's left of the of the
prosecution at this point
all right
and if the suspect is believed to be on
drugs you have more
more flexibility for you know keeping
them
under control and
uh let's say when asked explicitly
the expert here when asked explicitly if
any of the video of the event
showed chauvin placing floyd in a choke
hold
quote choke old which in this context
means a respiratory choke
um and the guy said no
so the expert said it was not a
chokehold
then he was asked if it was this other
thing a what is it a
blood um
oh was it was it uh was he being subject
to a
uh carotid choke which would have been
pressure on
the um is it the arteries the
arteries right on both sides of the neck
you know what the problem is that he
wasn't putting pressure on both sides of
the neck
so it couldn't have been a blood joke
yes
thank you so the blood choke is i guess
the common name for this
carotid choke or whatever and the expert
said
no it couldn't have been because it was
only pressure on one side
and you can't make somebody pass out
with pressure on one side
two sides would do it and even then they
might pop back
after 10 seconds so apparently the
amount of time you would be unconscious
even if that had happened which it
clearly did not
the video doesn't show any of it it
shows only pressure on one side
um that he probably would have popped
back in 10 seconds so
all the experts talking about their
their blood jokes
so apparently based on the video there's
no evidence that he was affixiated by
closing off the air
and there's no evidence that he was uh
that that that carotid that whatever
thing
that other thing happened the blood joke
but then there's a more interesting part
apparently according to police
procedures the police officers are not
supposed to medically help
the suspect when there is a situation
in which the police are not expected
to medically assist the person who has a
medical problem
right in their custody what would that
be
what would be the situation in which
police would not be allowed
to have medical attention given to the
suspect
it turns out that the situation is
exactly the one he was in
which is if the crowd is looking
dangerous
apparently there was an mma fighter who
somebody was physically holding back
from getting involved let me say that
again
an actual trained mma fighter
was yelling things at the police
belligerently
was making moves toward the police and
was physically held back by somebody
else under that exact situation
the correct police procedure is to not
give
medical help they are instructed to take
care of their own safety first
as the statistically best way to help
everybody
right the same way when you're on the
plane and the you know
they say put your mask on first and then
help the child that's next to you
statistically that's just the best way
to play it
the adult puts the mask on then you've
got time to help the child
right same thing with the police
procedure first the police have to get
safe
that's it first the police have to make
sure that they're safe and then they can
help the suspect
the mob murdered
floyd because the mob's actions
created the danger which made
medical intervention in what maybe would
have been in time we don't know
i mean that's that's a big if could be
the mob kill them
because they prevented the police from
doing their job and that's now in
evidence
that's inevitance that's not me saying
it that's his evidence now
sworn under oath from the expert who
would know the most
in fact this expert from the before the
prosecution
was so damning that the defense in a
clever persuasion move
said they were going to call the
prosecution's own star witness
as a defense witness
that is what you don't want to hear
if you're the prosecution that your star
witness
did so poorly that the defense is going
to call him next
ouch because there's nothing left i mean
the case is already destroyed so i guess
the defense is just going to walk on it
a little bit
so let's see what else is amazing about
this
um then the defense asked the expert
i think the medical expert if agonal
breathing
could be misinterpreted by officers as
just breathing now this
agonal breathing i guess is some special
kind of
identifiable last gasps of breath before
you die
and apparently if you're in law
enforcement or medical world this is
something you
might be able to recognize and if the
officers had recognized it
they would have more of an obligation to
do something about it right but the
question was
would would they be able to recognize
that given the crowd noise
and the answer was no that given the
crowd
shaven probably could not recognize a
change in breathing
that would have would have alerted him
that it might be this agonal breathing
again it looks like i think this is a
prosecution witness
basically said the crowd killed him
they said the crowd killed them
basically because if it
you know that's too far let me take that
back a little bit
they're saying that if the agonal
breathing had been detected but it
couldn't because of the crowd
you know or at least it's reasonable to
assume it couldn't because of the crowd
that that could have been a contributing
factor in his death if if there was some
way to save him we don't know that
um the fact that uh
shaven mentioned uh
what is this called this uh
excited delirium and he mentioned it on
a call to
you know i guess the headquarters or
something so we know that shaven was
thinking
that floyd had maybe this super strength
problem where if you have this excited
delirium and you're already really
strong
it just makes you stronger and then
you're like a you're like the hulk
suddenly so we know that he was worried
about that
which puts everything in in the right
context for the defense
so here's what i wonder about this are
we in the super ironic situation
where derek shaven has a wrongful
prosecution
lawsuit after he gets cleared in which
he will take so much money from the city
that it will effectively wait for it
see if you can finish the sentence i'll
try it again but you have to finish the
sentence for me
is it possible that derek shaven will be
cleared
and so cleared that it's obvious that it
was a wrongful prosecution
because remember the people who are
involved in prosecuting him
you know if you say it's the city's
legal
legal system and the police kind of
threw him under the bus too
while their own experts said there's no
evidence of a crime
their own expert the police expert
says there's no evidence of a crime
does he have a lawsuit now i don't know
enough about this
area of the law to know but i feel like
he does
i feel like he has the world's biggest
lawsuit doesn't he
i'm looking at your comments jeffrey
says no
is anybody uh well i know i know there
are lots of attorneys on here
i always have lots of attorneys on here
is there an attorney on here who can
tell me
if he'll have a lawsuit after this is
done for
wrongful prosecution all right here's
the definition wrongful prosecution
occurs when someone who is accused of
committing a crime
is tried based on false information
but wait any guilty judgment that is
based on
false prosecution can be appealed now i
believe that the prosecution would have
to know
that the information was false i think
that's the key
right it can't be that they're just bad
at their job they would have to know in
advance
that they were presenting fake
information
do you think that the prosecution ever
talked to the
main their own main witness do you think
that the prosecution
ever interviewed their main witness
before he went on trial
do you do you think they ever said to
themselves i think we'll just find out
what he has to say
when he's on trial do you think that's
how it went
or did the prosecution say we're going
to put you on trial
do you see evidence of a crime here
because that's what we need to prove
there's evidence of a crime
do you believe that the guy who who
testified
under oath told them a different story
and if he did i guess you know he'd have
some problems
but it seems to me that the prosecution
must have known
that their star witness
was going to be a witness for the
defense
if you'd know that and they had to know
it
right i mean you'd have you'd have to
establish this of course
but do you think there's any chance they
didn't talk to their own star witness
before they put them under oath in
public
i don't think there's any chance of that
is there i mean if you're a lawyer tell
me did i miss something
isn't that just common sense so i think
we have in evidence
extraordinarily strong evidence that
this is a wrongful prosecution
and i believe you can sue for that
so are we in the ironic situation in
which
derek shaven will be the primary person
who
fill in the blanks who
defunds the police
that could actually happen derek shaven
could be the guy who defunds the police
because the police just screwed him
and let me say if he bankrupts the
police
they have it coming because somehow the
police let this go all the way to trial
well maybe maybe that was smart right it
was probably
better to let it go to trial because
then all the all the evidence gets out
but it sure seems to me like a wrongful
prosecution
but for political reasons they probably
had to do it
i think they had to prosecute him for
political reasons
right for the public opinion but but can
you get a wrongful prosecution if the
reason they're putting them on trial
is their own safety from the public
like they're trying to prevent a riot
and so they decide to put him on trial
for murder
so it'll solve some other problem that
there might be violence
because it looks like that's what's
happening it looks like the city was
trying to save its own ass
by throwing this guy under the bus
and i should i should throw into this
that i'm not
i'm not sure that shaven did everything
right i'm not saying that
i'm just saying that in terms of what's
technically illegal i don't think
there's any chance of being prosecuted
for murder
specifically um
so now you've got cnn who willfully
reported
this trial the opposite of what happened
right
that's true right because they reported
this witness
as though he had the goods and in fact
it was the opposite of that
he was so far from having the goods that
he will be used as the defense
witness next so cnn is misreporting this
wildly i mean misreporting it to the
point of it's just opposite of what
happened
isn't cnn
guilty of creating a
riot and if somebody dies
and i'm sure there will be there'll be
at least injury
if somebody dies isn't cnn guilty
of third degree murder
now there may be some legal protection
for the press i don't know how that
works
but in a functional sense
is it true that cnn knows they're
they're lying
i would say yes i i feel we can say
safely that they know they're they're
misinterpreting the news
intentionally it's very clear i mean i
don't think there's any doubt about it
based on
you know what's obviously right in front
of us
so if they're misrepresenting it
intentionally the obvious outcome of
that
will be riots the obvious outcome of
riots is people get hurt
let's say somebody dies should they have
known that was going to happen
well i know it's going to happen don't
you
if i know it's going to happen months
before it happens
and i'm saying it in public hey they're
going to cause a riot somebody's going
to get killed and it's because of the
way they're handling it
if i know it and you know it do you
think cnn can claim they didn't know it
because they know it right i don't have
to be a mind reader to know that they
know the obvious
so that's happening right in front of
you at the same
time uh there is a chairman or president
xi of china has been sending fentanyl to
us
for years probably killed george floyd
my stepson
and i'm guessing a quarter million
americans by now
intentionally intentionally
that's right president xi chairman
whatever the he is
is allowing the fentanyl trade to happen
because we we know even who's doing it
if she wanted him to stop he would just
go pick him up
we know his name probably know where he
lives
you know it's a public record the united
states has already fingered the guy
who's the dealer over there
the main source anyway so she
has murdered a quarter million people in
the same standard which is the third
degree murder in other words
did things which he knew would cause
murder to cause death
and that's happening right in front of
us and it's not a story
right is it on the front page of
anything nope
nope it's not should be it's the big
story
so now we know that the crowd may have
been
uh guilty of at least contributing to
the death of floyd
we know that cnn and
the news that is not covering this
appropriately will be contributing to
the deaths of the coming riots that
they're
sparking probably won't be charged and
we know that
china's she is guilty of third degree
murder
mass murder actually probably a quarter
of a million people
and that's what we know like we know
that
there isn't a single thing i said that
is in question
is there right have i said one thing so
far about this case
that of which there's any real doubt not
at this point
let's talk about the imaginary news most
of our news is imaginary
as you know and let me list a few that
are in the headlines right now
so right now uh headline new york times
is saying that
matt gates asked trump for a preemptive
pardon
when the department of justice were
questioning his associates about
sex trafficking allegations
now let me read the sentence again and
see how you interpret it
matt gays so this is their sentence
right not my sentence
matt gates asked trump for a preemptive
pardon when the department of justice
were questioning his associates
about sex trafficking allegations
but what they go on to say is they don't
know if he was aware of those charges
do you think he was aware
we don't know this is news
because he might have been aware
according to them
that he might have been aware why do we
make news about things that might have
been true
do you know what might have been true
anything
this isn't news this is something that
might have been true
so has that become a headline that
something might be true
just about everything might be true
there's literally no evidence of this
thing which might be true
now you'd have to ask yourself why would
anybody ask for a pre-emptive pardon
that would just sort of cover everything
can you think of a reason can you think
of any other reason
that a prominent republican would think
that they had
general legal danger
even without this specific charges that
are that are being discussed now
yes a reasonable person would
reasonably conclude that they would be
targeted
for false claims of stuff
right or maybe he broke some law and he
doesn't even know it
because that's the world we live in this
is sometimes you can break a law
and not even know it example when trump
gave his speech on january
6 some people said he broke the law
because he incited a insurrection do you
think trump knew that
do you think when he was just talking to
people the way he always talks
he thought he was breaking the law i
don't think so
but others say he might have so in a
world in which you could just be
living your life and doing what you
always do in public
can people say that you broke a law just
sort of doing your job
and the answer is yes it just happened
to trump the exact thing just happened
to trump
he was blamed for a crime of something
that he probably thought was just
being trump talking about the stuff he
talks about
right so yes
it was completely reasonable for
somebody with his prominence in the
republican party
especially knowing that the department
of justice would become abide in
department of justice
completely reasonable to say you know as
long as we're talking about pardons
it wouldn't be the worst idea just to
have one
right now we also don't know how how
hard he pushed
or anybody pushed if it was just
something he brought up
just to feel out the room that was just
smart
if you were if you were in his position
and your your buddy the president
because apparently they're pretty close
and your buddy the president was handing
out pardons and you thought
maybe maybe somebody's going to come at
me with something and i don't even know
what it is
would you wouldn't you float it wouldn't
you just sort of you know
while you're at it wouldn't be the worst
idea to protect
your buddy because i don't know what's
coming at me but probably something
probably will be targeted by enemies
so is this news or is this just
speculation
well the news part is that yes for the
pardon which qualifies as
what smart so is the news that
matt gates is smart and he thinks ahead
because that's what they reported that's
what i would have done
in the same situation if i thought maybe
it could be useful and maybe i could get
it i'd float it
see what happened all right um
how about other fake news well of course
the
the floyd murder trial is mostly based
on fake news
now we have uh some reporting on cnn
apparently there's a
they've got a documentary in cnn called
i think it's on cnn
called cue into the storm and the
guy who made this uh believes that he
has found
q the actual person who is q
and he bases it on the reaction
of this person he thinks is q somebody
named ron watkins
you might know him from twitter as code
monkey
how many of you know codemonkey from
twitter
i don't know if he's still on twitter i
haven't seen him in a long time he may
have been
may have been booted off i don't know so
um somebody says it's a hbo show is that
right
hbo show okay thank you corrections
it is an hbo special called q into the
storm
and but uh
anderson coopen was uh interviewing the
maker of the
documentary and showed a clip in which
reportedly this fellow ron watkins
answered a question in which the way he
reacted
or laughed suggested that he was really
cute now i watched it
and i know what they're talking about he
did he did react
but he also said unambiguously he was
not cute
now of course people could lie about
that so that doesn't mean anything
but i don't feel that you could quite
say he's cue
because he laughed at the wrong time
uh let me ask you uh husbands
this is this is a question just for the
husbands okay
have you ever gotten in trouble with
your spouse
for laughing at something that they
thought
the spouse was laughing at maybe them or
something something different have you
ever gotten in trouble husbands only
for laughing at something when somebody
thought you were laughing at the wrong
thing
in the comments how many husbands have
been busted by their spouse
for laughing at the wrong thing look at
the comments
yes of course all the time
yes yup yes yup today
somebody said today yeah it's the most
universal uh thing is that people
laugh at the wrong thing because what
they're laughing at is something in
their head
right they're not necessarily laughing
at you they're laughing at some
dis disconnect in their head and so
when uh when i saw the clip i saw
somebody laughing
but to me i could have easily
interpreted it
this way now i'm not saying this is true
because we're not mind readers right
so it would be mind-reading to say he
had sort of somehow accidentally
admitted he was cute
i think that's mind-reading but it would
also be mind reading the next
interpretation i'm going to give you
it's just speculation okay
when i saw him like break into a smile
i thought he was laughing at the notion
that he would be fingered as q
because let me ask you this i put myself
in the same interview
and somebody asked a question which if i
answer it a certain way
makes it sound like i'm q and i just
admitted it
what would be my reaction to realizing
on live
not live but recorded video what would
be my reaction
if i thought i had accidentally outed
myself as q and i wasn't cute
what would you do you'd laugh
i would to me that would be hilarious
what could be funnier than making the
media think i'm cute
when i'm not that would be pretty funny
and if you don't laugh at that
you're dead inside now
i don't know a ton about the person
involved
ron watkins who went by
the name codemonkey on twitter i don't
know a lot about him but
i feel as if he's got a little bit of a
joker in him
wouldn't you say because even if he
really work you
it would suggest he's a bit of a
prankster right
you'd sort of have to be a little bit of
a prankster
to beak you so whether he was or not
i feel as if he's a prankster
am i pronouncing it wrong watkins
i don't think i'm pronouncing it wrong
all right uh
more fake news the the story about
desantis on 60 minutes and the public's
store the story is boring but just know
that
it's just fake news um so we've got
fake news about desantis may or may not
be
fake news about q fake news about floyd
basically it's just all fake news um
there's a new national survey
corey deangelis reports us that 71
of voters support funding students
instead of systems
let me ask you this do you remember
uh do you remember i was telling you
there's this weird thing happening where
whenever i'm persuading things go my way
now there's no way to know that i'm
having any influence and i wouldn't
claim any influence in this particular
case
but why is it every time i i'm
persuading things do go my way
and like fairly quickly so this is one
of my main topics
is that students should be funded
instead of schools because the
teachers unions are our source of
systemic racism and and now a solid
majority of
you know americans agree now i think
if i were to explain it myself my track
record is just crazy
so good but i think what's happening is
i'm just good at picking the right issue
i don't think it's that i'm changing it
so much or at all
i think that i'm i'm just good at
knowing well this has to happen because
the logic
you know the argument is just too strong
it's going to go this way
so i think i'm just going to uh
identifying strong arguments
likewise the biden administration now
opened a uh
they're going to build a gen 4 test
nuclear reactor in the united states
which is big big big news it's really
big news
and of course i've been persuading for
that forever
that we should be you know getting into
that harder but again the argument for
it was so strong
that i think maybe it was just going to
happen anyway
but keep that in mind so
let's see if i covered everything i want
to cover oh we got some more things
happening here
i issued a challenge the voter id
challenge
it goes like this find one georgia
citizen
who wants to vote
but it's thwarted by having no id just
one
because it's a national story that these
people exist
but curiously a national story about
you know what hundreds of thousands of
people how many tens of thousands
who would be in this category just in
georgia
and we haven't seen one is that weird
do you believe the news if you haven't
even seen
one what is the most common thing that
the news business does
they find a human to represent the story
it's the number one thing that the news
does in fact they hate telling stories
that
they don't have a person involved they
need a person
so you don't think they could find one
person
in the whole world can't find this one
person now
to be fair it might be hard because if
such people exist they probably don't
have cell phones
how would you find them i guess you'd
have to find somebody who could find
them
somebody who knows a relative or
something
but then do you think if you put that
person on camera and said okay you want
to vote
but the only thing stopping you is that
you don't have id
how fast would they get id
once they became publicly known in fact
don't you think that republicans
would pay for his id who
if this person exists the day you saw
somebody go on television and say yeah
i'm one of those people
i'd like to vote but i don't have the 30
or whatever it is in georgia 33 to get
an id
or i don't know how how long would it
take
one republican to say really that's why
you're not voting
here's 50 bucks go vote get yourself an
id
i i would buy somebody an id if i could
you know if i knew it was not going to
the wrong thing
if somebody a citizen of this country
let's say they're a black citizen
because that's the the group we're
talking about with the
not having enough ideas if a black
citizen a real person
had this real problem and really wanted
to solve it
and i was standing right next to him i'd
say seriously your whole problem would
be solved
for an uber ride and
um and 33 or not even that you just have
to send in a letter in the check that's
it
you just need 33 i would just reach in
my pocket i had him 33 dollars
say all right problem solved and i'm
pretty sure most republicans would
i mean not necessarily just like that
but you could find plenty of republicans
who would say
seriously that's your problem all right
we'll fix that
we'd like everybody to have an id
um taiwan is being surrounded by
a chinese fleet and so china's flexing
its muscles and
you know showing that they can surround
taiwan with their fleet and stuff
here's a question i ask yeah we we keep
talking about
china dominating the south china sea
which they are
and they are they're building uh
aircraft carriers
here's my question how long does an
aircraft carrier last
in a modern war with a superpower
five minutes it doesn't matter whose
country it is whether it's an american
vessel or a chinese vessel would it take
more than five minutes
for us to remove all of the battleships
and aircraft carriers would it
because we have lots of missiles now i
know
i know they all have defense you know
perimeters and they've got other ships
that are putting up anti-anything
missiles and
they've got radar and they've got
they've got all kinds of things
but it's really just a volume question
right if
one missile is going toward an aircraft
carrier well
you gotta you got a pretty good shot of
knocking it down
but america has more than one missile
we would show our submarines would be
sitting right under those things
the the the chinese aircraft carrier is
up here on the surface
our nuclear sub is going to be right
under it
i'm exaggerating you wouldn't want it to
be right under it but the point is
it would be sort of fast work
and i think that would work either way i
can't imagine an american fleet
would last more than a day in the south
south china sea
am i wrong about that
somebody said that somebody some
military expert said the next war
would be nothing but submarines and
targets
that's uh more insightful than i wish it
were
yeah taiwan has a big problem i've said
that there isn't any way that they can
stay independent in the long run
and china has a long-run mentality i
just don't think we're in a world where
you can defend a neighboring
piece of land that a superpower has
surrounded
i just don't think it's a thing and i
also wonder about the rightness of
us being there now at this point we're
committed to an ally because taiwan's an
ally
so we're in a situation where we where
we sort of have to do what we can
but um i don't know that a superpower
should have a presence or any kind of a
strong influence
that close to another superpower i feel
as if the superpowers ought to have a
little buffer between them
and i feel that china has a completely
legitimate interest
in not having the united states have an
ally that's
you know that close to them um
but of course i support taiwan
completely
um
[Music]
why do they want taiwan well i think
they want it first of all for defense
because you don't want an american ally
you know with a big economy and
who knows what kind of weapons right
right there so
i think there's a illegitimate defense
need
the same way if russia had put missiles
in cuba
we don't have any missiles in taiwan but
if if they had
if they'd militarized it a little more
you could see how it
could become bad pretty quickly yeah
um oh let me see this um
so admiral ridenour said world war
iii would sink all the carriers in an
hour yeah
yeah i i think it'd be less than an hour
well it would take an hour for them to
actually sink
it would take 15 minutes for them to be
sinking
i think
okay that's all for now i will talk to
you tomorrow

it will be
