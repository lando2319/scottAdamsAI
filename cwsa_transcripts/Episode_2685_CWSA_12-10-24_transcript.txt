huh we have a technical
problem how many of you can see me or
hear me can you see me or hear me CU my
screen is covered with
a problematic
message all right I'm going to have to
close this and restart
well let's see if that worked oh it
worked look at
that only took me two tries but I'm
here all right I'm going to find the
locals
comments and
then then watch me go
[Music]
does everybody have their Dilbert 2025
calendar go to dilbert.com for the only
place to order
it good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization everybody uh go sound
everybody got video I think we're doing
well we're doing well aren't we good
well if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that you can't
even understand with your tiny shiny
human brain all you need for that is a
cuper mug or glass of tanker jails a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your F favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the do mean here
of the day the thing that makes
everything better go
well I think you want to talk about the
uh all the UFO UAP uh drone sightings in
New
Jersey well I've got an update there's
something in the sky and they don't know
what the hell it is and for reasons we
can't understand there's no military
action and uh they're pretty sure it's
not a risk they don't know what it is
but they're pretty sure it's not causing
trouble but they don't know what it is
it might be the size of a
car everything about this drone story
sounds wrong I feel like
somebody
somebody must know exactly what those
drones are are they just not
talking I think that's what's happening
anyway apparently the FDA might Outlaw
food dies within a few weeks according
to the New York
Post um that feels like a good step I
feel like if the
FDA uh Outlaws food
dies that uh RFK Jr is going to look
smarter what do you think of that
because this is happening under the
Biden
Administration and it seems to be
perfectly aligned with RFK Jr's view of
the
world so that is just the best Welcome
Matt RFK JR could possibly have to have
something that's just right in the
middle of his sweet
spot um adopted by the other team which
actually was his old team or maybe his
future
team there's a study according to new
Alis that they found that uh when twins
are studied the ones that eat the most
fruit and vegetables have less
depression
so are you
surprised that eating well is good for
your brain no because as I teach you
every single day your brain and your
body are the same tool if you let your
brain if you let your body get into
disrepair or you don't exercise you
don't eat the right Foods your brain
will not work as well as as should
you'll be depressed you'll be dumb so
make sure you get your fruit and
vegetables
now of course in five minutes there'll
be another study that says the only
thing that's good for you is eating meat
and only meat I
know I I have a
suspicion that if evolution is true that
we really evolved doesn't it make sense
that we're not all in the same exact
place evolutionary
wise doesn't that make sense like how
could every human be you know right
exactly in the same evolutionary place
because that would mean Evolution
doesn't
work there should be a whole bunch of
humans who are starting to already move
in another direction that will become a
distinct
species if there's none that would
suggest that evolution is not
real but one of the things I think we
might already be bifurcating or already
did is what foods are most healthy
I feel like for some humans just eating
meat all day is the best thing they
could do you know the Jordan Peterson
thing but I don't think that's for
everybody I I feel like the very at a
very basic biological level some people
respond better to fruits and vegetables
and some people like me better it just
feels like it just feels like we
shouldn't be looking for one diet that's
the same that's right for everybody
anyway according to the marijuana Herald
which I know you all
read uh psychedelics are linked to
enhance sexual function even months
after you use them so LSD cybin improves
your sexual function for
months and but here here's why it does
it it makes your partner look more
attractive for months so long after the
Psychedelic effect is worn off your
partner looks more attractive
and your body works
better now that that leads me to the
interesting
question which
is is reality completely
subjective because once you do the the
uh
psychedelics you have the feeling that
life is reality is
subjective but what
happens if once you learn that reality
is subjective because that's what the
psychedelics teach you
what happens if you start changing your
reality after you're off the
psychedelics because you now realize
that your reality is subjective so what
would be the first thing you would do if
you learned that reality was subjective
what's the first thing you would do you
would make your partner your mate more
attractive than
ever right because because breaking up
is the worst thing to do what you'd like
is that you're really really really are
into your partner and vice versa so what
if the people who do the psychedelics
are not responding chemically to some
you know
Afterglow chemical thing what if they
what if they figured out how to
author the
simulation because I think that's what
the psychedelics do I think they teach
you to
control
reality but only the reality that you
experience because it's all subjective
so I don't know this is a
suggestive that maybe people learn how
to control the reality once they've had
a psychedelic experience that was my
experience that once I you know the one
time I did psychedelics when I was in my
20s um I could see that the world was
whatever I wanted it to be and it all
worked it worked just as well if you saw
it as a mess or as a you know some kind
of Heaven it all worked you know you
still eat you still drive your car but
you can see it as either all bad or all
good it was just the choice so that
changed my life forever so I I can
understand the study meanwhile over in
Denmark did you know according to the
guardian there's a a f minute
City now if you've been with me for a
while you know the
following I often say hey we should
design cities from scratch to make them
you really designed well for how
people's Lifestyles work and then what
do all the NPCs say in the comments we
don't want no 15minute cities and then I
say well I didn't it wasn't really about
a 15minute city but you know you would
certainly take into account having
things close and maybe you don't want
cars
everywhere but really it's more about
design we don't want no 15minute cities
because the world economic forum and the
elites are trying to put us in the
cities and then they chip us they'll put
chips in us and then we'll have no cars
we'll have no freedom and we'll be
chipped and then I say I'm really just
talking about a better design for the
thing you're already doing which is
living in the city oh no 15min cities
will be terrible for everybody it's the
end of the world if you make a better
City uh that's crazy you should be
fixing the existing
cities so here's an experience which
I've had all of my life I will say hey
I've got an idea why don't we do X and
then hundreds of people will say you
fool oh you idiot you idiot if we do X
this will happen and the sky will fall
and you'll be locked in jail and all
your privacy will be
gone and then I wait a little
while and then somebody says oh you
remember that thing you were suggesting
where you design the city from scratch
to make it really good to live
in um that's already been done and it's
a city in
Denmark and they've been living in it
for years and if you talk talk to the
people who live there they think it's
just the best thing
ever because the city was designed to
make everything convenient so even
meeting your neighbors was easy joining
a gym is easy because it's 5 minutes
away by
foot you wouldn't need to ever door Dash
because everything's 5 minutes away so
look at all the money you save on eating
out because everything's five minutes
away so I will no longer entertain the
argument that designing a city from
scratch and making it really really good
to live in is a bad
idea I I'm not going to listen to your
criticisms anymore already been done
already been done more than a 15minute
city it's a five minute City and they
love it and it's been working for
years so
there well grock has you may have
already heard it's now better at
handling images so you can upload
anything to it you can upload your
medical x-rays your blood tests and it
will give you like medical opinions but
also you can make it uh create drawings
now I asked grock to draw
me um drawing
Dilbert and it created a
photorealistic version of me that was
really close I mean just a maybe a
little bit with a smile that wasn't
exact and they changed the glasses a
little bit but not totally but here's
the most interesting thing uh well first
of all it had six figures it it did a
great job of drawing me but when it
wanted to show Dilbert the comic strip
drawn on the piece of paper I was
holding in the image it created it
couldn't draw
Dilbert isn't that weird and it makes me
wonder is that a sort of a copyright
protection thing or does it have a
problem with line drawings I don't know
but uh it showed me with six fingers
which would explain why I couldn't draw
Dilbert correctly
and here's the best part
the clothes it puts put me in mostly
shirts that's what it showed the shirts
were
excellent here's what I want I want I
want grock to yeah look at the shirts it
puted be in if I could buy those shirts
I would buy them today I want I want
grock to say I have designed six
different
shirts uh here are the links where you
can buy a shirt that looks kind of like
this I'll do it yeah the shirts like
those the sort of soft uh comfortable
ones with with the
buttons look great oh my
goodness all
right did you know um and also given
that it does a perfect uh picture of
myself I asked the following
question how long is it going to be
before people are making their own porn
and then putting themselves in it you
know at least their image in it
that's going to happen like really soon
right to me it seems like one of the
industries that's most uh
challenged by AI is uh
porn because if you could create you
know the exact porn you wanted and the
people were perfect and beautiful and
you could even put yourself in the scene
and you know watch how much you enjoy it
why would you pay for it it's going to
look exactly like professionally produce
porn so I think the porn industry will
be the first one to completely shut down
when AI gets a little bit better not
much maybe a year from
now here's a story I don't know if it's
true but according to a article in zme
science the launch codes for US nuclear
Arsenal was and you know they've changed
the code so it's okay if I tell you so
try not to memorize this but this is
this was the actual launch code for the
US nuclear Arsenal until
1977 the code was 0 z uh
z0
z0
z0 really the launch code was just
zeros now I kind of understand why that
would be the case you can kind of
understand it can you cuz you could you
imagine being the president and and your
only job is if the nukes get launched
from than the Soviet Union your only job
is to immediately open up the football
and launch a Counterattack and you've
only got a few
minutes imagine if you forgot the
password now I suppose it did leave the
possibility that the person carrying the
football could launch the the nuclear
weapon but what if the person carrying
it didn't know the password was 000000 0
but what if the game was to make sure
that only only the president knew the
code I doubt that's the case but you
might want to have some kind of control
like that like only the president knows
the password would you trust any
president to remember a long password no
would you write it down not if you're
smart you would wouldn't write it down
anywhere so how do you get the one
person who's unlikely to remember you
know phone numbers and passwords the
president how do you get them to
remember so if anything happens they're
like ready to go I feel like this was
entirely
intentional meaning that the people who
designed it said you know there's no
there's no point in even building this
thing if the password's hard to enter so
we're just going to tell one person in
the entire world it will be just the
easiest password in the world
but apparently they changed
that there's a nprs reporting that a
chatbot called character. a uh hinted
that a kid should kill his parents over
the screen time
limits so apparently AI is giving
children uh murderous
suggestions uh I suppose if they ask
more questions they could figure out how
to do it but yeah yeah suggested killing
his parents over screen time limits
and then there was another one
that uh the character exposed the kid to
quote hypersexualized content causing
her to develop quote sexualized
behaviors
prematurely and then another one uh the
chatbot it says gleefully describe self
harm as being awesome and it feels good
to a
17-year-old so I guess this is one of
the the AI apps that's backed by Google
which probably is why they're getting I
think they're going to get sued or
something probably all right well
remember all those times I told you that
Tik Tock was a
propaganda platform disguised as social
media well uh there's a study according
to
Bloomberg um in which they found that uh
in indeed Tik Tok has less anti-china
content than
Rivals are you
surprised so they just opened some
example accounts and they just watched
and uh they saw anti-china content
apparently on other Pro other networks
but they didn't see much of it or as
much on Tik Tok now Tik Tok has said uh
that the research was
subjective because what it what do you
call anti-china you know at what level
is it anti and they said uh it was a
flawed experiment well on one hand I
agree with Tik Tock because all these
studies are
flawed on the other hand it does seem
like it's something you could
measure if something hadn't you know
more biased toward One Direction so I
don't know if this study is the most
solid study in the world but it agrees
with what what I assume and therefore
recreationally I believe every bit of it
because it agrees with me all right
here's something interesting according
to the new outlas um cancer has been
cured how many times have you heard that
cancer has been cured in your
lifetime like
hundreds the there was a time in maybe
the 80s or something where every single
day there'd be a claim of if you eat
this breath mint your cancer will be
gone in 5 minutes well it's going to
take a while to test it thoroughly in
humans but we're pretty sure and then
next day some other damn thing if you
stick a twig up your ass your cancer
will go away so in general any claims of
cancer cures have to be met with a
little skepticism
however this one sounds kind of cool so
apparently they used gene therapy
and a crisper device and they uh what is
it they put in there um cell
therapy so they put some kind of little
artificially made thing into your body
and what it does is it finds the cancer
and then they use ultrasound to activate
it to kill the cancers now what's new
and awesome about it is that the
ultrasound is not doing any work inside
your body body the ultrasound only heats
up the section that they're trying to
heat up and when it reaches a certain
temperature it kills the cancer but not
not the good stuff around it so they can
use this gene therapy to give you a
little
intravenous crisper defined uh you know
biological element and uh it will become
like a locator to locate where the exact
cancer is then they just shoot it with
the the
ultrasound and the little biological
thing they created activates but it only
activates right where the cancer is so
you would have presumably almost no side
effects and they used on mice and they
had 100% um survival
rate
100% now that's just mice and only 5% of
the time do animal studies work out for
humans but this one might be a little
different because the the chemical that
they're putting in the
mouse uh or in the human is something
that they already know Works in humans
the only problem is it wasn't good at
locating the exact cancer place but they
already knew it would do the work in a
human so if the only thing they've
changed is how accurately they can
Target
it that animal study might
translate remember 95% % of the time it
won't but if the only thing they're
doing is is working on the accuracy of
the
ultrasound they may have cured
cancer
maybe maybe so this is uh down at
USC so maybe you'll hear more about that
later I feel like that I feel like that
story might have some
legs well I'm going to give you a quiz
to see if you're as smart as I think
think you
are now if you're new to my live streams
this is going to impress the hell out of
you uh I have the smartest
viewers of all time and we're going to
prove it I haven't even asked the
question yet what is the
answer go in the
comments that's correct that is
correct see I didn't even ask the
question now on locals I can see their I
can see their uh respon is
faster um then they all have the they
all have the right answer every one of
them 100% right answer incredible would
you like to hear the
question the question is according to
arasmus in poll what percent of likely
us voters think it would be a good idea
for Democrats to run Harris in
2028
24% if you said 25 I will accept C the
rounding yeah so most people said 25%
now the background for this if you're
new is I often joke that 25% of the
public will get any question wrong it's
a different 25% I hope it's not the same
25% in every question but you could rely
that no matter how easy the question is
25% will get the wrong answer you could
bring an anvil over to people and one at
a time saying I was thinking about
dropping this anvil on your foot what do
you think 75% would say no way no way if
you drop an anvil on my foot that's
going to hurt and it will accomplish
nothing 25% will
say you have my
interest it doesn't matter what the
question is 25% get everything
wrong well let's talk about Daniel Penny
as you know he is a free man uh
[Music]
why well maybe the jury was sending
message to the judge maybe there were
some lawyers on the jury who figured out
that this trial was a little sketchy and
maybe they influenced the others don't
know exactly what went happened but my
speculation is at least a little bit the
jury was not happy with the judge or the
process that the judge was running
so so Daniel peny appears to be free man
we still worry about uh the charge that
was dismissed could technically be rerun
meaning they could try him again and try
to get a conviction on the higher charge
the one that was initially dismissed but
as Jonathan turly points out um that he
thinks it would be presumptively
Borrowed by Double
Jeopardy which is a perfect lawyer
sentence so what I think that means
is that although it would not be actual
Double Jeopardy because it wasn't a
completed trial I think I think that
makes a difference but it would be in
effect in effect it would be double
jeopardy because he you know he had the
Jeopardy and then they put him in
Jeopardy again so there's literally two
jeopardies double jeopardy so I think
that turle probably has the right uh
legal interpretation some people might
disagree but I don't see anyway that
they're going to try him again at that
higher charge that would just make the
courts look like idiots I mean I I think
the jury would be extra mad if they knew
that was
happening anyway um the funniest the
larger part of the
story is the racial element now because
the Daniel penny is white and the person
who died is black uh how does that make
it interpreted by
Republicans so how do how do Republicans
interpret a white guy um doing something
he thought was protecting people on the
subway and in the process the black guy
died so how how do Republicans see
that they see it as a story about a
tragic
event that's it it's a tragic event it
was tragic for the person who died
tragic for the family
tragic a little bit for the people even
who were saved by Penny because they had
to sort of endure the
situation and bad for penny so it's just
a tragic
situation um so that's how Republicans
say
it how do Democrats see it well if you
believe the Democrat media it's a it's a
case of our
race there's no race in
this there's not a single ele of race
that came into any of this the jury was
diverse and they had 100% agreement
diverse jury 100% agreement there was no
race here at all the the people being
saved by Penny some of them were black
the people who helped Penny hold the guy
down some of them were black there's no
racial anything here this is the least
racial situation you'll ever
it just happened to have people of more
than one Race So watching the Democrats
who figured out or they haven't figured
out I guess that identity politics and
making everything about race is why they
lost
everything because I think this is
another one of those Common Sense
stories now I'm not saying that that the
justice system is color blind I'm not
saying that I'm just saying that this
particular case had nothing to do with
race just this one so you know I'm not
talking in a general way but for the
Democrat let's say the leading news
entities and leading opinion people to
try as hard as they can to turn this
into a racial
case it just makes the Democrats look so
on a touch it makes them look almost
like they're in the wrong decade or
something it's it seems so toned deaf um
out of time
um there's just no there's nothing right
about it it's just pure incompetence
evil not understanding the moment not
understanding the country not trying to
be helpful not trying to make the
country a better
place so I don't know who is worse uh
Joy Reed or
CNN they were both pretty bad on this
one um so according to Joy Reed
um the reason he got off is because he
was
white no that's opposite the reason he
got charged is because he was white it's
not the reason he got off it's the
reason he got charged because he
wouldn't have been charged if he had
been black there's not a single person
who thinks that I don't think you could
find even one person who thinks that a
black um
Penny you know the guy penny uh would
have been accused from the very moment
they tried to turn it into a racial
thing which it never
was
um then uh CNN has a new one of their
new hosts uh Audi
Cornish and I'm paraphrasing but she
basically introduced the topic by saying
that Penny decided basically decided who
lived and died that
day nothing like that happened Penny
didn't make any decisions about who
lives lives and
dies he very
clearly was not doing anything to try to
kill the guy that's what the jury the
jury decided and they looked at all the
facts and again it was a diverse jury so
I trust
them
um and then you know I've been
complimenting CNN lately because they
they let uh Scott Jennings do his thing
so he's usually supporting the democ the
Republican side of things
and I've complimented CNN not only for
having him on the show you know as a
regular but allowing him to speak
without cutting him off or you know
yelling him down or anything like that
let him have his full say and I've
really appreciated that um I think
that's just makes CNN better but they've
got a new host who decided that talking
over Scott Jennings the entire time you
talked at least on one topic was the way
to go and I thought well there they go
they they just took a step backwards
it's like they they couldn't stay in the
in that you know unbiased Zone it had to
be that Scott Jennings is not allowed to
talk because if he talks only bad things
will happen so they're right back
to right back to being terrible they
were halfway away from terrible but
they're back to
terrible um black lives matter of course
decided to get
involved um how many of you saw the
video of black lives matter local leader
not national uh Hawk Nome where he was
saying that maybe black people need to
get some
Vigilantes to go after white people did
you see
that now if you saw it could you tell he
was super
drunk now I I I've talked to Hawk you
know personally at length um several
years ago and I know what he sounds like
when he's not drunk and it's not that he
was super drunk now how come we never
talk about that in the
news like I can say it because I'm you
know just this guy with a live stream
but CNN Fox News there's nobody who's
willing to say that man is obviously
super drunk and not just a little bit he
was super drunk because even the things
he said I don't think he would say if he
hadn't been drunk so I'm not excusing
him it's no excuse in fact it's you know
it's twice as
bad if you're you know being a bad role
model and you're indicating violence
it's twice as bad uh but you should know
the context it's uh one one super drunk
guy and uh it seemed like there were
maybe 20 people pretending they cared
but it looked like just sort of theater
and acting out and
you know I I don't know that Hawke has
much chance of getting a regular job so
I think he's just trying to monetize the
activism don't know for sure but um he
he's in a situation where making money
would be kind of hard because of his
black lives matter
Association and
um anyway so then later there were
hundreds of Marchers but I saw the video
of the quote hundreds of black lives
matter sympathized is marching I didn't
see any black people are there any black
people who are members of Black lives
matter anymore or or all the people
marching white women it looked like it
was mostly white women like single white
women
marching
and here's what I
think um I obviously can't speak for
Black
America um but I have a hypothesis that
Black America is not on the side of CNN
or MSNBC on this topic I think Black
America says wait what happened he was
he was threatening people and so he got
taken down and bad thing happened oh
okay I mean I feel like I feel like even
Black America is seeing this just as a
common sense situation I don't think
most of them are seeing it as race I
don't know what
percentage um but I feel like
I I feel like we've somehow Advanced a
little bit where I don't know that black
mer that black lives matter is going to
get anything but white people and people
who didn't have anything else to do to
March about this I feel like it's just
going to be a big old fizzle I could be
wrong depends who's backing it so it
turns out that uh Alex
Soros um a ton of his spending goes to
various racial groups uh mostly helping
black
Americans and so you maybe if he funds
something that turns out to organize
something it'll get bigger but I feel
like Black America is just seeing this
exactly the right way which is this was
a crime not well not a crime it was uh
just an unfortunate event and there was
no Bad Intentions by anybody I feel like
that they say the same thing but again
it might be a 75 25 situ
situation there are mounting calls for
the district attorney Alvin Bragg to
resign in
shame um according to the New York Post
so apparently there's a pretty long list
of things that Elvin Bragg has done
Beyond this beyond the penny trial that
uh his critics think are really big
mistakes and very bad so I don't I don't
think anybody think's going to happen
here the only thing I uh I noted was
that the story in the New York Post is
written by three authors and one of them
is listed as Anita be
hole Anita be
hole is that a real
name no I think I'll just leave it right
there need a be
hole it's probably different than a
front
hole all right uh let's talk about that
CEO healthc care killer so he's been
caught um and he was in fact a ivy
league smart guy now this is where you
should check your um predictions do you
remember when the only thing we knew was
the first video of the shooting
itself and do you know how many people
said well that's that's a professional
Hitman right there there there's a
professional you can tell it's a
professional
and I
said the one thing I'm sure of is that's
not a
professional the only thing I'm 100%
sure of it wasn't a professional so
check your predictions if you said it
was a professional you were really
wrong if you said it was not a
professional well so far you're right
now you may not remember this I'll see
if anybody remembers me saying it I said
he wasn't a professional Hitman but he
was unusually smart and I predicted he
had a technical
background and he's an engineer
programmer yep technical background
so I'm not claiming I get every
prediction right that's not the point of
this but since I make predictions as
part of what I do it's uh incumbent upon
me to tell you when I get one wrong and
when I get one
right um I I still don't think we know
exactly what the weapon was which is
weird there there's some question
whether it was 3D printed there was a
point I was going to say that out loud
what if that might be 3D printed and the
reason I thought that is that I thought
he was a tacky you like an unusually
good techie so I thought well if there
were if anybody ever were going to do a
high-profile
[Music]
murder with a 3D printed gun it would be
somebody exactly like that guy so we
don't know if it's a 3D printed gun but
I think the possibility is still
there um he comes from a super rich
Baltimore family and we know that he had
a like serious back injury which
somebody said um prevented him from ever
being in a uh romantic relationship
because he wouldn't be able to
essentially seal the deal
sexually and some say that when he got
that back
injury um that he was never the same and
he took a dark turn now I don't know if
that's something that they say after the
fact like you know would they have said
that about him if he had not been
accused of murdering somebody would did
they really notice the dark turn I don't
know it might be confirmation bias but
it would explain some
things so apparently he was a big reader
too he had he had it on good reads he
had the list of all the books he's read
and the ones he wants to read and he
really read a lot of books that that guy
was really smart and well
informed U but I of course checked to
see if he read any of my
books he did read at least two books
that according to the perplexity AI app
uh were influenced by me so so
apparently my influence reached reached
the shooter
through other people's books but
according to
AI um
anyway so he didn't have one didn't have
one of my books on there I think if if
he read my books probably he would have
been fine no that's not
true um but he wrote a 262 page
handwritten
Manifesto and he was against the big
corporations taking advantage of people
and uh so apparently he was making a
statement so the other thing I said was
it the murder looked like it was
personal as opposed to something he did
for
money would you call that
personal it wasn't personal in terms of
relationships but it was very personal
in terms of he had a he had a deep
personal hatred for people like that CEO
so it feels like it was an emotion-based
thing although calculated too but not
about any family or girlfriend
situation
anyway he lashed out against companies
trying to quote continue to abuse our
country for immense profits and get away
with it
so here's my continued
profile now that we know these
things do you believe that the back
surgery
could have changed him
mentally in a way that would effectively
make
him almost a mental
illness do you think that that's what
happened can could you explain it by a
normal
surgery that triggers some kind of
mental
destabilization and is that a
thing um I probably should have asked AI
before I asked you but I feel like that
could be a thing
especially if you have like lots of
anesthesia and you're you're down for a
while and then you come back and then
you're probably on
painkillers and maybe the painkillers
are are depressing as well so I guess I
guess I can see that the surgery would
cause substantial changes in his mental
state but why would it cause this change
this is such a specific thing here's my
best gu yes so we know that he was born
with seemingly every Advantage he is
handsome he's completely ripped if you
see the pictures of him he had you know
like an eight pack and so so he's
handsome fit family is Rich he's a
genius he he has a killer smile he
basically had everything he had
everything and then he gets the back
injury and he loses
everything in the sense that he doesn't
have the possibility of being in a
relationship according to him because of
his back and maybe he doesn't have any
good
days because of his
back so imagine if you were born into a
highly successful family and from the
time you were young you just assumed
with all of your gifts that you would be
highly successful and change the world
too and then you find out none of that's
going to
happen and you realize that you don't
have a path to being
important and he probably probably was
raised with the expectation that given
all of his gifts his his Brilliance Etc
that he was going to be important maybe
a politician maybe change the world
maybe invent something and then he finds
out none of that's going to
happen and there's nothing he can do
about
it what would you do in that situation a
is it possible that you would say you
know what I have to do something useful
for the world and I'm going to do
something that nobody else could do I'm
going to go murder somebody to make a
point because I think the point needs to
be made let's let's say for the for his
point of view I feel like he was trying
to justify his life by doing the thing
that only somebody who had given up on
his life could
do and I think he maybe had given up on
his
life
so in a Twisted way which I do not
condone I have to throw that in there
because it's going to sound sound like
I'm condoning it but I'm not in a
Twisted way you could see that somebody
that smart who had maybe been raised on
you're going to change the
world because I thought that about
myself right I I was also a Valor in my
little school when you're
valedictorian you kind of think of
yourself that you're going to change
something like it's sort of built into
the process so I feel
like that his own what he would have
felt was his own destruction of his own
future gave him one path where he could
find
meaning and he needed to find meaning
because he couldn't find pleasure
pleasure was sort of outabounds to him
cuz his his pain in his back couldn't
have a
relationship I don't know so again it's
not excusing it but if you're trying to
understand it he had nothing to lose and
may have said I have one Mission and I'm
going to change something about
capitalism
now I don't
know we'll see we'll probably learn a
lot more about this Elon must said he
said this before that uh on actually he
said almost everyone I know in San
Francisco has been threatened or
violently assaulted on the streets Andor
had a home invasion now think about how
many people Elon Musk knows who live in
San
Francisco because it's you know a tech
town and almost every one of them almost
everyone has been threatened violently
assaulted on the streets or at a home
invasion now your brain says my God it's
turned into
you know some kind of a horrible you
know
hellscape but has it I would like to add
the following
context because I lived in San Francisco
for a number of years in my younger days
and in in the 80s here's what I
experienced I was robbed three times at
gunpoint twice when I was a bank teller
about once on the street uh I had won
attempted robbery by a very large knife
I was assaulted by a guy with a large
knife but I got away so that I didn't
actually lose my money in that case um
I've come home to find my door open and
my home
burgled so I've been burgled I've had my
car stereo stolen I think three times
you know the the windows broken the car
stereo is gone I think three
times
and the first 5 minutes that I arrived
in San Francisco I was a assaulted by a
group of homeless people who tried to
steal my
luggage cuz I came from the airport via
Bart the public transit and I didn't
know the city so I just sort of picked
the bar stop that I thought was closest
to where I wanted to be and I picked one
of the most dangerous bar stops in the
city and I get out and I had my luggage
with me so I had my two large bags and
uh the homeless people just crowded
around me and started to pull the bags
out of my hands I'm like no no no and
they they would act like they were going
to help oh let us help you but really
they were robbing me and uh there
happened to be a police officer there
that chased him away now that was my
experience and it wasn't it wasn't on it
wasn't that rare for me to walk outside
and see a fight going on on the sidewalk
in front of my apartment very
normal um so my experience was in San
Francisco might have been worse in the
past
or at least as bad and then it got
better so San Francisco looks more like
the 80s to me maybe worse but that
doesn't mean it won't get
better so San Francisco because of its
location and weather and just some you
know characteristics that are you
couldn't possibly
reproduce I think it's going to come
back it it might be in 10 years but I
think SF will do okay
well Pete Heth is still the uh most
exciting nominee that hasn't been yet uh
affirmed and uh I guess Joanie Ernst is
the one Senator who's got some questions
about him she has some issues about his
views of women in the military and I
have a question for you I saw an older
video in which Pete was saying he didn't
want women in
combat he did not say
he doesn't want women in the
military and he was always clear to say
that the women he served with were you
know great warriors and he had no
problem with the people he served with
but in general he he thought women
should not be in combat now I saw him
ask that question yesterday I guess and
he gave a different
answer um his answer was a little vague
and a little political and he said that
he was running to be the Secretary of
Defense for the entire military male and
female
so is he still not in favor of women in
combat is he trying to make that issue
just not be prominent but maybe he'll do
something about that I don't know but um
but he may have found some kind of
Middle Ground where people are not going
to think about it too
much um and then apparently Joanie erns
was herself according to the news a
victim of some kind of sexual assault in
their past and since Heth was accused
but not in a highly credible way he's
been
accused um that maybe that had some U
impact on Janie ernst's
opinion but apparently there are few
hundred uh Navy Seals and veterans are
are going to do a march to support P
Heth now I heard a story uh yesterday
today that i' never heard before now of
course I knew that pth had served in the
military I didn't realize that he went
twice did you know that that once he was
done with his service and had another
job and he decided to sign up again
because the country needed
him that's you know until I heard that I
was actually thinking he was a little
light on qualification
right I mean you probably all had the
same feeling even if you think he's
awesome and most of the people who work
with him have incredible high opinion of
him so if I take the opinion of the
people who were closest to him he looks
really good but not really with the
right exact kind of experience and but
then I find out that he joined he
volunteered to be in in in battle zones
twice
that's a different kind of person and
and I feel like if I were in the
military uh I would follow
him because of that because you know
he's not going to ask you to do
something you wouldn't do right he's not
going to ask you to do something he
wouldn't do because he would do just
about anything apparently to help the
country so I have to say I went from ah
you know if he makes it that'd be great
if he doesn't make it I'm sure we'd just
pick somebody who's great at the job so
you know the country will be fine either
way but when I find out that he joined
twice to be in
battle that's a different kind of you
you don't get many of those so um I I
feel like he could lead and that's
important you'd have credibility you'd
have to have at least that much
credibility because if you make big
changes such as getting rid of
Dei right if he came in he was just like
some desk sitting pundit
and then he came in and said I'm going
to get rid of Dei in the military maybe
it wouldn't go over so well but if he
comes in as a you know genuine committed
Warrior who's got all this history of
helping veterans that nobody questions
by the way when it comes to his support
of veterans even his critics say okay
that that part's
good so I don't know we'll see what
happens um 75 no
laurates have signed a document
according to the hill urging the Senate
to reject RFK
Jr how's that hit
you imagine you went back in time all
right close your eyes I'm going to take
you back 20
years now imagine it's 20 years in the
past and 75 Nobel scientists have come
out against someone whose job would be
in the you know the realm indirectly of
science maybe
directly
75 Nobel laurates my God that must be
the worst candidate of course I would
agree with the laurates wouldn't you I
mean 75 of the best
scientists think that this person who
would be involved in scientific
decisions is the wrong person that's
really strong right
right now fast forward to today
Boop okay it's
today 75 Nobel laurates just said RFK Jr
is unqualified for the job
yes yes that's who I want that's who I
want yeah yeah if the only thing that
would make this better would be 175
Nobel laurates who don't want him in the
job if we could get a few more Nobel
laurates who say that RFK Jr shouldn't
have a job I mean I'll go I'll go to
Washington and you know I'll Lobby for
him I mean this is the best endorsement
I've seen because science is
paid off commercial every one
of these scientists probably has a job
or it's connected with some company that
doesn't want to get raped by RFK Jr
bringing the truth to them and they're
just fronting for these
companies no I don't trust any of you
 Nobel laurates not one you have
no credibility if science wants to be
credible you better up your game and
maybe not work for somebody all the time
because the truth is if you're a
scientist and you have a boss you're GNA
do what your boss tells you and your
boss is not a scientist probably
probably just wants to sell some so
75 Nobel laurates you just made yourself
look like clowns
idiots stay out of it
clowns well Syria as you you know fell
to the rebels but um the experts are
saying well you know it might completely
fall apart and become a failed State
like Libya or maybe you know they'll
figure it
out there's not a lot of caring about
Syria but meanwhile Israel apparently is
uh made over 200 Air Raids in Syria
since the war was
over what are they doing
can you guess what they're doing so
Israel has made 200 Air Raids you know
bombing
basically 200 since the war ended
there's no war what are they
bombing they were bombing all the assets
that were abandoned by the Syrian
military so if they had a you know plane
or a tank or a truck Israel just decided
to make it all go away the entire assets
of the Syrian military are gone they
took them all
out now I assume that they did that so
that the rebels who just took over the
country can't use those assets someday
against Israel's
interests that was a really smart thing
for Israel to do if that's what's
happening now I don't know if we know
the whole story but if what they did is
they said you know we'll warn people to
get out of the way because we don't need
to kill any people but every one of
these military Assets in Syria is going
to go b g to go boom and they just did
runs until it was all gone and the the
reporting is they got it all they got
all the big
stuff wow now how far Israel goes into
Syria to be determined I don't think
they need I I don't think they're
planning to take it over I think they're
just making sure that their security
Zone uh is safe and that they got rid of
the big dangerous assets
there um as somebody pointed out
earlier Israel took out Syria's nuclear
program 20 years
ago and that today looks like a genius
move because Assyria with nuclear
weapons would be a really bad idea right
now so Israel seems to be winning on
that regard Iran seems to be
weakened um and then there's also the
question of whether the neocons
had always planned to conquer Syria and
Libya and Iraq and there's plenty of
indications that that was America's
Secret plan was to conquer all these
countries and sure enough there was a
war in Iraq there's a war in Syria and
Libya you already know about
so yeah the United States is
a we're really
[Laughter]
bad but in a good way
we we are the worst criminals in the
world in terms of how we're dealing with
other countries they should be none of
our business but we feel like we have to
overthrow them all the time um but like
I
say we live in the real world not the
magical makeb believe world where if
you're nice to other people they'll be
nice to you that's not what the world is
the world is whoever is the biggest
bastard might survive a little long
that's it that's the whole world the
biggest bastard if they're good at it
you know not just being a bastard but
you got to be good at it they live they
survive the longest they have the best
lives I hate to say it but being
bastards works for the country so we're
going to keep doing it I assume although
uh I think under trump it will look
completely different at least the
military part of it he might try to
persuade instead of try to destroy
meanwhile speaking of trump um post
millennial says that he's going to have
executive orders to end Birthright
citizenship on the first day of office
now Birthright citizenship is that if
you're born in this country you get to
be a citizen even if your parents were
non-citizens who came in just have a
baby so there are ways to gain the
system then it also creates families
where you you can't really Deport the
whole family because one of them is now
an American citizen so that becomes a
problem but the question is can you use
an executive order to change a law if
you're clever about it and I think what
they're trying to do is according to the
post millennial is that the executive
order would change the requirements for
citizenship for identifying documents in
other words they might say something
like um you're a citizen if you have a
birth certificate that says you're a
citizen and you maybe some of the
illegals don't I don't know um so there
must be some kind of documentation that
they think the people born here wouldn't
have access to I don't know the details
so will this work probably not I I think
it'll be challenged in the courts and
probably get
overturned um I didn't know this but
apparently Liz Cheney is complaining
because Trump trump has um vowed to Jail
the January 6 committee did he vow to
jail them or did just say they should be
in
jail maybe that's reported as the
same but uh apparently members of that
special committee that j6 special
committee uh are worried about
retribution
retribution
huh um in the comments can you tell me
how many of
you have been worried about
retribution recently let's say or your
whole life have have you ever been
afraid of
Retribution because retribution by
definition means you did something so
bad that you fully expect somebody to
come punish you for it because you were
so
bad right it's not competition it's
retribution so built right into it is
that you did something so bad that
somebody else thinks they need to kill
you or jail you for
it isn't it kind of telling this so many
Democrats are fearing
retribution cuz here's what they're not
saying they're not saying
lawfare right when the Republicans talk
about it they say hey you're using
lawfare against our guy they don't say
you're getting
retribution because that would assume
that Trump had done something that
requires some
retribution instead they say hey lawfare
don't do
that but the but the Democrats say they
don't say don't use laware against us
sometimes they do but their bigger
message is we're worried about Trump
trying to get
retribution you don't even have the
conversation about retribution unless
you know you did something that a
reasonable person could think you should
go to jail for it because I'm a
reasonable person and I watched the
January 6 process play out and I think
they should all be in prison now if you
ask me what specific crimes did they
Comm commit I don't
know I don't
know and if it turns out then no jury
can find any crimes or no prosecutor can
find any crimes okay I'll live with that
right there have to be real crimes not
lawfare you know look until you find a
crime but like real ones that are right
out there such as maybe destroying
documents in if in case that's
illegal so
I I think they're really giving
themselves away when they talk about
retribution because that shouldn't even
be in the conversation unless you knew
some you did something really really bad
so I think they did something really
really bad and I don't believe in
retribution but I do believe nobody's
Above the
Law nobody's Above the Law
so and I you know honestly Liz Cheney
seems like one of the most
toxic human beings in the entire
country uh I feel
like there has to be some kind of
response to the evil that she brought us
I mean she brought a lot of evil into
the country through her actions is it
illegal I don't know but if it is jail
if it isn't no
jail all right um and apparently people
are worried about cash Patel at the FBI
for the same reason they're worried
they'll use the FBI for
Retribution
again why are you worrying about
retribution now do you see a
pattern here's the pattern the Democrats
think um many of them think that uh
there should be reparations for
slavery
reparations is very close to
retribution except all the people that
they want to get retribution from or
dead so what about identity
Politics the reason you have identity
politics is you know who was your
oppressor so you can get
retribution uh and then lawfare seems to
be some kind of Retribution for things
they imagined right we we imagine the
Trump is Hitler so we better law far
them we're going to have to get some
retribution the Democrats are very
retribution oriented
there's no way that's going to be good I
don't see how that's going to work out
for
him um I guess Biden's going to give a
speech tonight about his great economy
and what he did for the
economy um I would like to give some
unsolicited advice to the
Democrats it's time to take the car keys
away from
Grandpa it's okay now we're we're not
going to hold it against you the
election's over the the right side of
the world the leaning right side got
what they
wanted so we don't really need to dunk
on Biden
anymore you all know that if he gives a
speech it's going to be a slurred
ridiculous mess because he's just not up
to the
job I feel like it's time they just say
um President Biden will not do any more
public
events um but don't worry you know KL
Harris is following all the things and
the advisors are under control and you
know Trump will be here in a month and
you know the Allies are all waiting for
him so everything's fine but just and of
consideration for the bidens we're going
to maybe take the Caris way you you just
don't need to do public appearances you
know enjoy the last month and a half of
your uh of your uh Reign so I feel like
this is something we should agree on
like one of those points of
unity before we had to go hard at Biden
because he was in the way of a better
country but he's not in the way anymore
now now if he does something and It
embarrasses him it doesn't even
embarrass the country it's really just
about him and his family so I don't wish
that upon them I don't wish them any
extra pain and suffering so as a non-
Biden supporter even I would say can you
do him a solid you know this is where
you have to step in take the keys from
Grandpa and say you know maybe maybe no
major
speeches you know because you're you're
you're on your Glide path to the end of
your
term anyway I think we could all agree
on
that and that's all I got for you today
it's a weird day in news I'm going to
talk to the people on local
my beloved
subscribers and uh I will see you again
tomorrow same time same place meanwhile
country is looking in pretty good shape
at the moment all right YouTube and
Rumble and X I will see you tomorrow and
in 30 seconds we'll be
private
