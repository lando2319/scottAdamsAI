hey everybody
come on in it's time die for
coffee with scott adams best part of the
day
oh yeah every single time it's the best
part of the day
especially when you're prepared what do
you need
a copper mug or glass attacker
challenger sign the canteen jugger flask
a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
allow me to put my microphone on
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the what
is it
simultaneous that's right go
so good so good well
i've been trying to come up with a name
for something
there's a category of thing happening
that doesn't have a name and it's always
fun to be the person who could come up
with the name
of a thing that nobody is named yet
and i'd like to come up with a name for
the people on twitter
probably social media in general who
come into a conversation
after it looks like you know how it's
going to go
and they couldn't they couldn't hang
with the actual debate
because they don't understand the law
and thinking and logic and any of those
useful
things that you would need to be part of
a debate but once they think it's
settled
there's this group that comes in to add
sarcasm
and that's all they do they don't bring
a debate an argument a point they don't
bring information
they bring just sarcasm and so i've
decided to call them the sarcasm guppies
because they're not they're not
full-grown fish
because the full-grown fish can have an
actual conversation with
data and reasons and arguments and stuff
but they're not them they're they're
like the the sarcasm guppies
and they swim in afterwards and if
somebody if somebody yesterday
yesterday thought the sun would be out
but it turned out to be a cloudy day
instead
the sarcasm guppies will come in and
they'll say finally
finally something i'm qualified to
interact with
i couldn't hang with the logic and i
couldn't hang with the facts
oh but now so now they said it was going
to be
sunny but it wasn't it wasn't
watch this hey i thought you said
today would be sunny but
not wearing my sunglasses at my i guess
i left my
sunglasses home
owned owned so those are the sarcasm
guppies
you're seeing a lot of them today did
you see the uh lawsuit
uh i think this is a petition to the
supreme court
i might be using the wrong legal words
here but ted cruz has apparently put
together
a uh an appeal in which
he's challenging the pennsylvania part
of the pennsylvania
result and here's the thing
if you are waiting for a strong case
were you thinking to yourself gosh i i
hope someday there's a stronger
case for the trump side well
uh if you don't know this already ted
cruz has argued and won cases
at the supreme court so ted cruz is the
guy you don't want to mess with
if you're going to be in a legal uh
battle
you know you imagine yourself you get in
the legal battle and you're thinking to
yourself
god i hope the other side doesn't bring
somebody good
and then ted cruz shows up as the
attorney for the other side
and you just say to yourself damn it
damn it it's ted cruz so here's the
argument he's going to make i'm going to
butcher this
and i'm um i'm uh i'm drafting off
of uh jack busabe who yesterday did a
live stream on this so i'm basically
going to tell you what jack bosovic said
on his
live stream because i don't understand
this field
but he did a good job of breaking it
down and it goes like this
so there was uh
i don't know if i can get into the
details but the the essence of it was
that prior to the election there was no
standing
meaning that nobody had been injured by
anything
until the election happened and the and
the
the charge was that some changing in the
rules that didn't go through the
constitutional system
created an unconstitutional thing
which happened
and the claim is that those votes that
were
part of this unconstitutional decision
should be thrown out and the argument is
really really clever
in a legal way which is why i'm going to
butcher it probably but the the thing is
that until the election happens no but
nobody has been harmed
and apparently you can't bring an action
to the court
and say hey there's this thing that
happened
when it hasn't happened you're simply
worried that a thing will happen
so in the beginning you have no standing
so you don't have a legal remedy then
the election happens
and then the court says too late
because you knew about this thing a long
time ago
but you waited until now and there's
this thing called the doctrine of
latches
that i heard about one day ago and
that says you waited too long to bring
your case and that
is a disadvantage to whoever you're
bringing your case against
so you can either be too early and have
no standing
or you could be too late
because it's too late and there's no
there's no there's no room in between
now ted cruz has said you've done
something that is clearly and
unambiguously unconstitutional and
indeed i don't even think pennsylvania
would argue the point
i don't even know if there's an argument
that says it was
constitutional because they very
publicly did something
non-constitutional
right in front of everybody the there i
don't think there's any question of fact
that it was a non-constitutional means
the problem is
that in addition to doing something
non-constitutional
on top of that like that wasn't already
enough reason to reverse it
on top of that the courts created a
situation where it couldn't be
addressed in the courts because there
was no time between the
you don't have any standing and it's too
late
there was no time so
let me ask you this if you're the
democrats
and you hear that the you know the angel
of death
uh ted cruz has has decided to put his
name
keep in mind ted cruz has a you know a
track record
a reputation of success with the supreme
court
he's putting his name on this damn thing
right do you think he'd put his name on
it
if it were not pretty solid i don't
think so
now i'm no expert on law
and you know when you hear about stuff
like the doctor and
latches and you say to yourself oh i
thought i kind of understood things and
till i heard that and i don't know what
the hell that's all about
so i don't like to think that i know too
much about what will happen in a court
case
but as a layperson if you tell me
this story you know the way that ted
cruz has laid it out
you tell me that ted cruz put his name
on it he put his name on it
i'd be a little bit worried about that
if i were a democrat
so what do you think of the odds that at
least
pennsylvania will be reversed
if you had to bet now some of you
haven't seen the
the the legal documents the claims
but if you had to bet what are the odds
of just that one state
we'll just talk about that in isolation
what are the odds that that would be
reversed
based on this pretty good
right pretty good
i think it's closer to a hundred percent
than zero
but beyond that you know
i would just be flailing so i'll have to
see uh what the
counter arguments are it's always easy
to be seduced
by the initial argument because lawyers
are good at making the initial argument
no matter what it is
sound pretty good you have to wait for
the other side or you don't know
anything
all right let's talk about how
the democrats may have allegedly
allegedly not proven in any court of law
pulled off the perfect alleged
crime and it goes like this and i gotta
tell you
if it sounds like i'm a little bit
excited by this
you're right i i absolutely love
seeing a new business model i'm sort of
a business model geek
but i would include a perfect crime
if somebody pulls up pulls off a perfect
crime
i don't like it especially if i'm a
victim of the crime
but i'm still impressed by a really good
crime
all right so similar to the way that i
can be
totally amused and entertained by
president trump's
you know aggressive personality toward
his critics
i can simply appreciate things without
without losing sight of the fact that
there's a downside to a lot of things
all right so here's here's the perfect
crime
as i see it alleged
did you hear me say a legend all right
so these circles represent
the alleged instances of fraud in
all the many places and the many
different uh
precincts and counting areas now let's
just limit these to the swing state
cities the ones that are
under question and let's say
hypothetically
so this is not a claim of fact this is a
hypothetical
but it's looking like it's shaping up
this way
hypothetically suppose that these black
circles represented
real fraud but they are all
cleverly sized such that
if somebody discovered one of these what
would the court say
the court would say yeah it does look
like that happened
but it's so small compared to the whole
election
it's not going to reverse it so
there's no point in even hearing it
because even if it's true
what's the difference now there might be
a separate criminal case if there's a
person who did something bad
but in terms of reversing the election
the court is going to say yeah you
you've got a pretty strong case but we
don't care
because it's not big enough to reverse
the election which is the whole point
so they packetized their crime
so that if you found that somebody
brought in i'll just use some
hypothetical examples so these are not
scot claiming facts i mean this is just
an example
so it's about suppose one of these was
somebody brought in a truck full of
fake ballots and there were 20 000 of
them
and they catch that truck and they say
we're throwing out those 20 000 ballots
doesn't matter it wasn't enough wasn't
enough
then somebody else was putting in a you
know a usb
stick into something and changing some
votes and somebody else was running the
same votes through
and somebody else was changing the
sensitivity on the signatures
somebody else was doing a little uh
ballot harvesting in a state where
you're not supposed to do some ballot
harvesting
and on and on and on
now the second part is these
red circles represent disinformation
intentional
disinformation and on top of the
intentional disinformation
which you know exists you can be pretty
sure
that the democrats did hire
disinformation professionals
actual people who don't do anything else
well they do other things but
they're experts at disinformation i
would say there's pretty much a
guarantee that they were at work
and they seated this with a bunch of
fake
stuff so that if the news found one of
these fakes
and then two of these fakes and then
three of these fakes and then four of
these fakes
and then 25 of them
what is the public going to think
because the fake news says well
yeah they're making a lot of claims fake
claim fake king
fake claim you lost in court you lost in
court you lost in court you lost in
court you lost in court
what does the public think what would
the public think
who is not following things at the
detail that many of you are
what would they think well they would be
quite
um you could forgive them for thinking
that this was a completely clean
election
and even the people in charge of the
election
told you it was clean so the experts
told you it was a good election
the news told you every time they made a
claim
it got debunked debunked debunked debunk
what the hell are you going to think
you're going to think the election was
clean
the loser's a sore loser is complaining
all right but on top of this you've got
this excellent timing situation that i
alluded to
that before the before the alleged
improprieties happen it's too soon to
make it
to have a problem with it because
there's there's no standing in court
because nobody's
injured yet and then after it's done
the timer starts because the
constitution requires you to certify
and move to each step and to be done
with it
in a specific time
how much time did let's say durham take
for his investigation well he's not done
yet
how much time did mueller need for the
mueller report
a long time so
we know that how how long it takes to do
a complicated
investigation especially with all this
disinformation
here imagine if imagine if mueller
and john durham had to spend 75 percent
of
all of their time chasing disinformation
i'll bet they didn't because i don't
know that anybody was
i don't know if there's any reason to do
it to inject disinformation into the
mueller report
i mean the uh obviously the uh
the things he was investigating were
disinformation
but i don't think on top of that people
were injecting disinformation to make it
harder
so anybody who would want to
find a real fraud and prove it and get
the level of evidence you would need
would have the most compressed time
frame to do it
and on top of a compressed time frame
would have the entire media against them
and would have
um uh and would have so they would have
the timing problem and then they would
have all the
the disinformation that they have to
wade through which would take them even
longer
so it's the perfect crime
it's the perfect crime because i think
that after this is all said and done
the history will record okay it took us
a long time
might take you five years and five years
later you get a
a whistleblower says yeah you know i
drove that truck
and then maybe it's six years later and
somebody comes out and says
i gotta admit i did mess with those
machines a little bit
gotta admit i'm on my deathbed i'm just
to tell you
so you can imagine the history will
piece it together
eventually now let's talk about
the security on these machines
so dizzybrad on twitter twitter twitter
user
uh tweeted this talking about the
uh the security of the voting machines
which have a
usb drive and disney brad says for our
pipeline
operations control system now obviously
it would be pretty important
to have good control on the pipeline
because if the pipeline goes nuts you
got lots of problems right
so the pipeline operations control
system they
weld the usb port closed
to prevent unauthorized access need an
update
call instrumentation team plus the mech
shop
so you have you would have to actually
call engineers
to engineer a brand new usb
port if you wanted to change their
software
now that is computer security
right if you think computer security is
hey don't put anything in that usb drive
that's not computer security if you take
a torch
and weld that usb a hole shut
that's computer security likewise
um
all right likewise
i'll add another point and then i'll get
back to it um
oh here's here's an example of what a
bank would do so this is also from a
tweet
somebody said i've sold integrated
software to large banks
three times now so this is banks buying
software what do they do when they buy
software
he says each time there was an extended
and rigorous code review
where every line of my code was looked
at by their technical experts
if i would have refused to cooperate
they would have refused to buy
basic security policy
that's what's that's what computer
security looks like
so these are two examples of what you
should look for
do our voting systems have this level of
security
doesn't look like it doesn't look like
it so
here's something i learned today that is
interesting apparently all of our
election
devices the voting machines have to be
certified by
an accredited lab so any
anything that will be part of the
federal election has to go through an
accredited
laboratory wouldn't you like to hear
from the employees of the
voting machine accreditation
laboratory does doesn't that feel like a
gigantic
uh thing that we should have been
hearing about by now
so i tweeted this at tucker carlson's
uh account because i would love to see
tucker carlson or somebody somebody
who's smart enough to ask the right
questions
bring the lab on and say hey you've had
these machines in here
and you've accredited them what are your
standards
for accreditation is it just that you
looked at it and you ran some
you ran some tests and it worked on the
one machine you had access to
or do you check every machine or do you
check
and determine that if the one of them is
fine
that there's no way that the other ones
could have been altered because the one
you checked was okay
what does it mean to you know what kind
of standard do they use wouldn't you
like to know that
now i'm not sure that uh
tucker carlson would be the right
personality to ask these questions
because
ideally you'd want to you'd want
somebody who knew computer security
and technology to ask those questions i
don't know who would be the best person
in the comments yeah somebody says no on
tucker because you don't trust him
because he's being too honest
the reason you're mad at tucker is
because he's being honest with you
all right i can find reasons to disagree
with tucker on you know various things
but if you're mad at him for being
honest with you that the evidence has
not yet been proven
in a way that he as a legitimate
voice on television talking about the
news could repeat without being
embarrassed
don't be mad at tucker for being honest
because that's all that's happening that
is all that's happening
show me show me one thing that tucker
has said
that's not true all right
if you can do that then i will have some
sympathy for your argument
that something happened to tucker and
he's he's gone bad
but if you can't show me one thing he
said on this election question
that isn't true i'd like to see it
maybe you can make your case but i kind
of doubt it so give me
give me some suggestions of who would be
the best person
to interview a technical expert
from a voting machine accreditation lab
i mean i can do it i i can i could ask
eighty percent of the right questions
probably
but i feel like we could come up with
somebody a lot better than me
tim poole i don't know what his uh
technology background is
you dr shiva might be too smart
you know there's sort of a there's sort
of a middle ground here
because if you've got a technical expert
and then
the person asking the question knows
even more than the technical expert
you may have confusion on confusion so
you need somebody who's
capable of asking the right question and
there aren't too many people who are
in the news business who are also
capable of doing that
right somebody suggested john mcafee
uh but he's dying in a spanish jail if
there were a way
to get john mcafee out of his spanish
jail
to to do this interview he would be in
fact
the perfect person i hear you say uh
i'm seeing robert barnes and
matt brainard being suggested but we're
looking for technical experts not
legal and or data analysis experts
peter thiel well i'm looking for
somebody who's actually a news person
would be ideal
all right anyway i'll put that out there
maybe the news can
settle that let me talk about what are
the strong arguments
against the election being fair
so strong argument number one is the
pennsylvania case
now that's not an allegation of fraud
per se
because everything that pennsylvania did
was public
it's a weird kind of fraud because they
did it right in front of you
here's our constitution and now watch us
ignore it and just make up some laws
so would you call that fraud if the
government just says
hey guys uh we have a bunch of laws
just want to let you know we're going to
be ignoring the laws
we think it's good for you we have an
argument we're
you know there's a reason we're doing it
but we're doing it right in front of you
and we think we're doing what's right in
other words they were allowing
a kind of uh mail-in ballot that the
constitution did not allow but they
thought that male in ballots would be
good
so they did it right in front of the
public does that make it a fraud
technically i'd say no
i don't know the sort of a legal
question right
you know i don't want to just use the
word you know and make an argument just
based on a word but if you do it right
in front of people and you tell people
while you're doing it
what's that called i mean it might be
unconstitutional but is it a crime
if your stated intention is to do what's
good for your people
and i'm sure that they said it in those
terms right that was the whole point
hey our people want to vote mail in
ballots there's a coronavirus
why wouldn't we want to give this to our
public you know it's an emergency
situation so we're gonna
we're gonna cut some custom corners on
the whole legal thing
but we're doing it for the benefit of
the people
why is that is it a crime
i actually don't know because it's not a
fraud because
there's nothing hidden it's not a fraud
if nothing's hidden right and it's
not exactly a crime it's just
unconstitutional
for a good purpose i think the supreme
court still has to
rule in favor of ted cruz's
uh claims because i don't think the
constitution can say i'm sorry i don't
think there's a case where the supreme
court wants to start a precedent that if
you think the constitution
isn't what you want you can ignore it
because that's what happened right
pennsylvania's saying all right with all
good intentions
we think our state constitution is
flawed for this situation
so we're just going to ignore it
i don't know that the supreme court can
ever let that stand
but i will warn you
that the supreme court and i think uh i
think alan dershowitz
told somebody recently i heard anyway
third hand
that he he agrees with the general
notion that the supreme court will
favor um stability of the country
over maybe the the technicalities of the
law
and the constitution i so there is a
there's a very real possibility that the
supreme court will say yeah
you made your case but
that's worse than if you had so we're
we're going to just sort of act like you
didn't
and and deny it so that's possibility
all right so the pennsylvania case i
think is strong argument number one
strong argument
number two i would need a fact check on
this but the news has made this
claim that the uh the dominion software
people have denied an
audit of their system because of
proprietary
information now the first thing you have
to say to yourself is
is that true did they really just say no
you can't look at our software because
it's the sort of thing where you look
into it and there's probably a little
nuance there
so it might be something along the lines
of they're just using that as a stalling
motion
or i don't so there's probably more to
the story
but here's my claim
if we can't audit our nation's vote
counting software
because the company claims its
proprietary information
i'm totally cool with that because i
think you can have proprietary
information
if there's if there's an entity that
wants to claim their
technology is proprietary i think they
have every right
you're short of a court case i suppose
but they would have a right to
keep that secret wouldn't you say
don't you think the the people who have
vote make
voting machines have every right to keep
their technology
proprietary i think they do
you say no but they have that right oh
oh i left them apart
i'm not done with my point they have the
right
to not let us look at their machines
we have the right to throw out the
election
because they wouldn't look at our
machines so they're right
i'm okay with i feel i feel like they
can keep that right
to not let us look at their proprietary
information
but they don't have any control over our
rights
our right is that we can throw out their
ship all of it
and i would say that that one fact
should throw out all of the votes from
the voting machines
if i were you know benevolent supreme
court
ruler of the universe i don't think you
need to know anything else
i think you just have to know that these
the system that counted our votes we
can't look at
that's the end of the story let me let
me present my entire
case to the supreme court uh supreme
court
there's a voting system that we used in
a lot of swing places and
they have proprietary software and we're
not allowed to look at it
so we should throw out all those votes
what's the supreme court say uh but
scott
that that would be bad because if we
disenfranchise people
that would be bad for the system well
they might vote against me
because they want to protect the system
but do you think they would disagree
with this point
that you don't really know who won so
long
as you can't look at the code right
you wouldn't know who won we we wouldn't
be able to certify
an election meaning the the elected
officials who have to certify an
election
they can't really certify an election if
they can't look at the most basic
information that would tell them an
election happened
i would i would argue that because we
can't
um audit the software if it turns out
that this is true
that we can't audit it we don't know if
an election actually happened
not only can we not certify that the
election was
fair we actually can't certify
that it occurred right
because an election would be people vote
those votes are counted and then you
know something happens because of the
vote
we don't have evidence that is that is
you know solid evidence
that that actually happened we have
evidence that people
you know pushed buttons on machines and
we have evidence that we have a
president-elect
what we don't have is all that stuff in
between which is called
the voting process it just doesn't exist
so if i'm the supreme court i say uh are
you telling me you had a vote and you
can't prove that you even had the vote
i would think that the minimum
requirement to say a vote occurred
is that you can tell right that you can
identify it
you can detect it it's not detectable
you can't find the vote because you
can't look at the software
so there's this whole black hole you
know your votes went into the black hole
but you don't know what happened after
that
so can you certify that a vote happened
when you can't tell that's a pretty
strong argument isn't it
i haven't heard anybody make that except
me on twitter but that's the argument
i'd make
all right so now you've got the
pennsylvania argument looks pretty
strong
you've got the uh you've got that
argument that looks pretty strong
that you can't audit it you can't
confirm it
and uh
i had one other argument oh the
organized bullying
if you heard any of the witnesses uh in
michigan and i think pennsylvania too
but the michigan one was especially
strong and the one you have to if if you
want to go
look at it on youtube and see what i'm
talking about
there was a blonde woman in michigan
uh i'm going to call her a super karen
in a complimentary way all right so
everything i say after this is a
compliment
even though i started it with super
karen this sounds like i'm going to go
the other way
so super karen who was uh complaining
about management
if you will you know complaining she was
one of the witnesses for the
the election now here's the interesting
part i believe she was trained
and or paid by dominion so
she was paid by the people who were in
charge of having a good election
i believe fact-checked me on that i
think she said that
and she witnessed a whole bunch of stuff
that if any of that stuff is true this
was a
very bad election but part of what we
heard from the witnesses
is the bullying now the bullying
has sort of a special place
in american hearts wouldn't you say
let me ask you this there are two bad
things that happen to you today
just hypothetically one of them is you
know just some bad thing happened and
the other thing is that you got
bullied which one takes over your brain
the bullying one right the other stuff
is just bad news
but when you get bullied that's really
that that's where all the controls come
off of my brain
in my world uh bullies are the ultimate
crime
because they leave you damaged forever
but you've got nothing you can do about
it
because you're damaged mentally and
so bullies i i hold
as my greatest villains in life you know
short of
mass murderers i suppose but bullies for
me are just like the worst of the worst
of the worst
and it appears according to these
witnesses that the bullying was
it looks like it was trained and
organized
in other words that the bullying the
bullies were using
actual techniques that they had been
trained to use
allegedly this is the allegation trained
to use
to bully the republican witnesses
out of the witness area and there are
lots of reports that it worked
they found tricks one of them was hey
why don't you go get a snack
and then they lock the door and don't
let them back in
one of them was complaining that
somebody was playing with their mask
too much and so it was not healthy that
they're in the same room
so it looks like they have a sort of a
list
of things okay try if this doesn't work
try this if this doesn't work try this
but the bullying included you know
physical intimidation and
it included you know words about your
mother sexual
insults i mean really bad bad stuff
so here's my take if it can be
demonstrated that the bullying was
widespread
in the in the keys the key swing cities
only if it can be demonstrated and
clearly there are multiple witnesses to
it
i would say that any any voting precinct
in which they were counting votes
under the under the pressure of bullying
they should all be thrown out now
this is my strongest point not legally
so i don't know you know the odds of
getting any
any legal action for this are probably
low but
in terms of just you know a person on
this world
you know a citizen a patriot somebody
who just wants to get
a good result so let's not talk about
the legality of it per se
if you put me on the supreme court and
you parade several witnesses in front of
me who are credible
and you tell me that those witnesses
were physically intimidated
during the process of an american
election i throw out every one of those
 votes
everyone because you know what my
tolerance
for bullies is zero not
one percent not a little bit's okay
 zero now
the with the big argument against
picking out any one of these little
little bubbles and saying
hey you know this little bubble looks
like fraud
but it's too small i kind of agree
with the the court system
not throwing the country into a you know
civil war
if they can avoid it and that might mean
shading their opinions a little bit to
ignore the technicalities of the law
to just keep society together
let me tell you where my limit is i'm
very much
about agreeing that the supreme court
especially
if their intention is to keep society
together
i'm kind of okay with that even if even
if the case doesn't go my way
but here's my exception bullying
bullying is my exception if you give me
a choice of accepting
that this election had bullying
and the bullying worked and i have to
live with that
to avoid a civil war you
civil war civil war first
bullying is after that in terms of my
preferences
no if you want a civil war with actual
violence allow bullying to continue in
her
and you know prove it's true and then
allow it to continue
if you allow this bullying to go
untreated and uncured
it has to happen next time there isn't
any chance it won't happen next time
and nobody thinks otherwise there's
nobody in the world who would believe
that the bullying happened and worked
who wouldn't also believe it'll happen
next time
that is worse than a civil war
it's worse suppose you said scott the
civil war a million people are going to
get killed
let's do it you can't have a system
that allows bullying as the main process
of how elections happen the reason we
fought a revolution
is because we had that kind of a system
right the the bullies in
in in england were bullying the
bullying the uh the people in america
and the people in america said you know
i would rather have a
civil war than to be treated this way
because if you think about it the entire
civil war was about how they were being
traded
it wasn't even about you know wasn't
somebody trying to build an empire
it wasn't religious based exactly it was
people who didn't like
bullies we are an entire country
built on don't bully us
we will leave your goddamn i'm sorry i
know you don't like when i swear that
way
we will leave your entire continent we
will get on a little boat
and go across the whole freaking ocean
into
uncharted territories to get away from
people telling us how to live our lives
no bullies bullies are the limit
no bullies in our system so if this gets
to the supreme court
and bullying can be demonstrated as not
only
something that happened in one of these
key places
but it looked kind of similar in other
places
that would establish at least the
suggestion that it was organized
now imagine if you take these
allegations that are in individual
places
and you can establish that they used
similar techniques
or worse you can you can actually find
the flow of communications
in which they were trained to do it
you're the supreme court hypothetically
and you've seen witnesses and you are
convinced
that cis yeah systemic bullying was a
planned
operation what do you do with those
votes
well if you're the supreme court and you
learn that the voting outcome
is tainted by bullying even if you don't
know how much you changed the votes
if you don't throw out all of those
votes you're not doing your job
because that is far more important even
at the risk of civil war
even at the risk of civil war real civil
war
it's more important bullying
cannot survive if you have to die
to get rid of bullying do it because
you're not going to live
under bullies that's the limit
there's no negotiating there's no
compromise
there's no let's put up with a little
bit
bullies that's that's a yes now
boom there's no there's no nuance
for bullies bullies gotta lose or you
gotta leave
you either have to beat them or leave
you don't live with them right
so beat them or you leave the country
but don't live with bullies
just don't do it all right so i'd like
to compliment uh
super karen the michigan witness uh
and here's the compliment part uh
she was really credible you ever you
ever listened to somebody who
there's just the way they talk it's not
like they're trained
you know persuaders necessarily but the
way she talked
if you heard her carried uh
carried some intelligence and
credibility that you can't really fake
if any of that wasn't real i mean she
could be mistaken about observations of
course
but that looked pretty honest to me and
she looked super credible and she wasn't
the only credible person
some of them were less credible but
there were plenty of credible ones
um where are the dominion employees on
television
being interviewed and asked to address
the many claims
about security etc well apparently
they've decided to go quiet for legal
reasons
probably smart in a in a legal sense but
how
how good do you feel about the fact that
the people
who really could tell us you know the
counter argument
the ones who could say yeah yeah we know
those usb
ports are open but here's the reason it
doesn't matter
would you like to hear that or the ones
who say
uh well okay we were actually networked
to the internet we said
we weren't but yes now that you
mentioned it we were
but it doesn't matter and here's our
reason why
you're mistaken don't you want to hear
that
why is that missing shouldn't dominion
be all
over the news saying uh these are crazy
claims
let me let me show you the machine here
i'll hold it up
you can see for yourself look there's no
usb thing
look there's no connection or whatever
should they not be trying to defend
against these claims in public obviously
they have a legal strategy
but i feel like you know maybe it's a
good
legal strategy but it certainly makes
the public have
less trust not more
all right
so did you see have you seen some of the
project veritas
they're starting to drop little audio
tapes from apparently they got the phone
numbers
to listen in on cnn executives do their
planning call once a week or whenever it
is
and so james o'keefe was personally
listening in on all the cnn
like uh executive calls which is
hilarious by itself
and one of the things they caught
answered a big question for me
don't you ever wonder if the cnn
executives believe their own news
have you ever wondered that because you
you look at it you say to yourself
i'm not even sure they believe it do
they
are they telling you something they want
you to believe but privately they don't
believe
it because that was always a mystery to
me you know how much did they really
believe
and on the call you hear one of their
executives
saying that uh that fox has a
white supremacy hour that is the tucker
carlson
the tucker carlson show and that it is
quote naked racism
now given that this was a phone call
among people who knew each other
and was not meant to be public i take
this as confirmation
that they believe their own fake news
and i'm thinking i don't know i don't
know
if that's good or bad like on one hand
i guess i'm happy that they're not
intentionally telling us
one level of news while at the same time
thinking it's not true
but maybe it's just as bad that they
believe it
because you can't spend too much time
watching tucker carlson
without hearing him say over and over
again that race should never be part of
any of our
process or our country or our decisions
tucker carlson objectively speaking
is the most anti-racist person
on television because most people only
go halfway
they say we don't want to be racist
against this group of people
tucker carlson completes the picture and
says ah
i don't believe the constitute i'm
paraphrasing of course
i don't believe the constitution says
that only some people
you know are special i believe the
constitution says very much the opposite
that you know the the freedom from
racism should apply to all people
not to some so he is indeed
the least in terms of what he says on
television
the most anti-racist person on
television period there's nobody even
close
name anybody who is willing to call out
racism
on both sides just him
he's the only one everybody else just
picks aside
so they actually believe they're fake
news it was kind of interesting to know
that
um apparently a lot of people have now
i tweeted this so i know a lot of people
are agreeing with me
that the fraud will eventually be proven
and proven to the point where it would
have changed the election
but probably won't matter probably biden
will be
will take the job anyway but here's
what's interesting about this
and i'm gonna say i think it's
unprecedented
or unprecedented which is
have you ever had a president who got
who's leaving office after one term who
realistically might run again in four
years
have we ever had that somebody who was
in the job
got replaced and then ran again in four
years or you thought they might
i can't think of any other time that
happened but here's the
bad situation or good depending on your
point of view
that that creates um trump
is now going hard at the tech companies
so he's he's saying he's not gonna
he's gonna veto some i don't know
defense bill or something national
defense authorization bill
that uh unless they put into it getting
rid of these section 230 protections
for the social media companies which
would make them
subject to being sued for doing bad
things now
trump it looks like he's going to lay
waste
to all of his enemies who would be
enemies when he runs again in four years
this is a really kind of a dicey
situation isn't it
now i'm clearly you know pro-trump
but even i am uncomfortable
having a sitting president who's going
to mow the lawn before he leaves
and the lawn is going to be everybody
who is on the other side
and might give him problems in four
years so the lawn
includes the social media companies it
looks like he's trying to take them out
before he leaves office
now i believe his case is solid in other
words i don't think he's just
flailing around at his enemies the
section 230 thing is
widely you know widely popular by lots
of smart people who say
we just need to do this change so it's
not some kind of a crazy
unfair attack you could argue it either
direction but it's not an unfair attack
and i don't know how good this
is that he has the power of the
presidency
and he can he can really change things
to
set the table for him in four years for
example
he could take out you know the fake
media the social media companies
he could he could do a lot of damage
just setting himself up for 2024.
now if we only take this one example
that's a perfectly
fair thing to do but it would certainly
help him in 2024
if he wins on that um
so the other news john durham apparently
barr
turned him into a special counsel and
now that he's a special counsel
it's less likely that biden will fire
him although biden could
but it's less likely he would do it
because of the political blowback
so i don't have a comment on that it's
just a thing that happened
um here's a uh
a disturbing theory that i saw
recently uh it was a ray dalio i think
was saying this that civilizations
follow
a or at least world powers follow a
predictive
cycle of growth and then decline
and i'm gonna summarize it so it's a
little
less accurate but so you have a society
let's say america
that becomes prosperous but the
prosperity turns into
inequality and that turns into calls for
you know solving the inequality which
which turns into debt
because you've got to print money to
give everybody enough money
you're printing money you're creating
debt and then basically you have civil
war
and decline so that's the cycle
prosperity inequality printing money
debt civil war decline now
why is it that you think the united
states is the biggest
power in the world today it's because
every other power
declined right a hundred percent of all
the other powers before the united
states became the dominant power
a hundred percent of them who were once
dominant powers
declined like that none of them last
at least hundreds of years they don't
last
so is the united states trapped in this
inevitable
uh cycle of growth and then decline and
our
and our are we on the backside of this
where we're into the printing money and
revolution
somebody's calling that the fourth
turning that might be related to this as
well
well here's what i think
i feel as though history doesn't work
anymore
meaning that everything that used to
work used to also be
predictive if if things always went this
way before
that's a pretty good indication it's
going to go that way again
because there's just something about it
but you know the world isn't the same
place it ever has been
we are connected by communication we
have we have abilities to adjust in ways
we couldn't do before
uh even gigantic problems we can handle
and shrug off
you know if you were a major power in
the past and you had a gigantic problem
probably took you out but today a major
power can have a gigantic problem
and just handle it so i just don't know
that the cycles that made complete sense
in a pre-internet world
still makes sense for example economic
let's say economic upheavals that just
you know destroy your economy
and in the old days we didn't have good
communication and we didn't have good
economists and we didn't have good data
we didn't have all of the mechanisms
we've developed
to address those shocks so the shock
could just you know take out your
civilization but today
same shock i think we would just get our
experts together and we just sort of
work it out
so i i would present to you that
probably
uh the most famous
last words of everybody who thought they
were smart but they weren't
is that it's different this time
how many times have people been wrong
saying well
it's different this time so that's
sort of the biggest trap you have to
watch out for but
i do think that a world with internet
is not the same as the world
pre-internet
and when you take those pre-internet
patterns and imagine they will repeat
post internet i think that has to be
tested
has to be tested so i don't think we're
in decline
i think we're probably closer to the
golden age than decline
and that's my show for today i hope you
enjoyed it
and i will remind you again that if you
like to see my extra stuff i'm going to
start putting more things
in december on the locals platform
locals.com subscription platform where i
put my
my life advice lessons
micro lessons little two-minute lessons
and
and other content that's not the only
thing on how to
live your life better so that's on
locals
and i will see you again tomorrow right
back here
all right you youtubers you know i'm
going to hang around after i turn off
periscope
oh good somebody's somebody there saying
you love locals
yeah one of the things i didn't uh i
didn't see coming
about locals is that it attracted people
who
think like me which is sort of why they
wanted to be part of that community in
the first place
and so a lot of the content that the
other people who are part of the
community are bringing
is really good stuff and i don't have
all the trolls over there
uh trump martial law now i don't think
there will be any trump
martial law uh odds of a re-vote
close to zero
uh somebody saying something
anti-semitic
uh is the supreme court hostage to the
threat of riots yes
yes and they should be i don't think you
want that to be different
necessarily i think they do need to look
at the big picture and you'd kind of
want them to
um how does the bully issue get resolved
i don't know
i feel as though the supreme court might
be able to do something with it but i
don't know how you turn it into a
supreme court case you know because
because bullying isn't exactly a
crime right or maybe it is
maybe it's assault i don't know
is this the best time to be a political
pundit absolutely
the time of trump is the best time to be
a political pundit just because all the
energy is there
but the number of people like me who
have
gone into this realm of podcasting
is really interesting and i would argue
that the um
the balance of power is changing because
of it
you know the the people who used to be
the gatekeepers of truth
were you know the news and your
politicians and stuff but i would say
the gatekeepers of truth
um that's that's migrating over to the
podcasters
and the reason is that the podcasters
typically
not all of them but typically um have
more independence
and so the podcasters can say whatever
they think is true
and that's their business model if you
are a tv news company
what can you say about pharmaceutical
companies when they are your entire
their your entire support and basically
most of the news networks are beholden
to pharmaceutical companies because
that's their advertisers
i i don't have that problem who am i
beholding to
anybody i can't think of anybody
so if you were to look at the podcasters
you know the political pundits were
growing up in this new medium you've got
the ones who
take advertising as their business model
joe rogan would be an example of that
now do you think that joe rogan has
complete
freedom in a way maybe he did in the
beginning
i would say no i don't know that it
makes his product any worse
probably doesn't because he has more
freedom than you know 99 percent of the
world to say what he wants
he's built uh he's built a brand around
that
so he can get away with stuff you can't
get away with such as
smoking a joint on tv he can do that
i could do that when i was on a show but
not many people are in that position
where it wouldn't hurt them to do that
but i would argue that anybody who's
taking advertisement
has a little less free speech not
not not in a technical sense but
certainly in a practical sense
because you you just have this bias that
says
i don't want to say something that cost
me all my advertisers
reasonably right now how often would
joe rogan even want to say anything that
was so bad he would lose his advertisers
probably not often i mean it probably
doesn't come up a lot but it's his force
you know you can't say it's nothing and
i think he would agree if he asked them
you know do you feel the pressure of
having advertisers does that you know
do you have do you feel the pressure of
spotify and i would say he's doing an
amazing job of pushing back against that
pressure
especially when he had
alex jones on his show the spotify
people
rebelled against some of his content
including alex jones
so what does joe rogan do when spotify
rebels against his content
he picks the most provocative thing he
can do and he puts it on
now that's that is exactly how if you
were a fan of mma fighting and strategy
you would go at them you wouldn't say oh
i'm sorry
let me take down all of my old content
you would go right at them
because a good offense is a good defense
so that's what joe rogan does
i think i think he's going directly on
offense
his critics and that's a really good
strategy so he'll have more free speech
than most people because of his brand of
who he is
and and the fact that he understands
that offense
makes more sense than defense in these
situations
but what about somebody who has a
similar kind of a job and they don't
take any advertising
well i take advertising indirectly
because on youtube you know there's an
advertising
model but people can be subscribers to
youtube but never see ads
and then i started locals as a
subscription service
specifically so i wouldn't be so
beholden on youtube so tomorrow if
youtube says uh we've decided your
content is
all going to be banned i'll just go over
to
locals and just carry on it'll be fine
so i don't have to worry so much about
the the economics of advertisers
so i feel like you know in terms of
who's
