hey
it's time yeah it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and you
lucky viewer you came to the right place
at the right time unless you're watching
this on replay in which case
the delayed simultaneous sip
some would call it the async or the sip
but that's just them
it's still just as good but
you know you need something to get this
going right it doesn't happen by itself
no you can't do the simultaneous sip
unless you have a cup or a margarine
glass of tank or chalice or
a canteen joker flask a vessel of any
kind
and fill it with your favorite liquid
i'm partial to
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens
right now go
that's some good sipping right there i
hope it was good on your end too
all right let's talk about all the stuff
that's happening
uh rasmussen poll is teasing us today
and i think you'll get the official
answer uh in an hour or so but they're
maybe two hours uh
it looks like the president's approval
level is gonna be
impressive i think you're gonna like
it i can't tell you what it is but
rasmussen says you're going to like it
if you're a trump supporter
all right um so the trump administration
announced that they're going ahead with
their
uh their planned and scheduled
turndown of the chinese app tick tock
and also wechat i guess and this is
they had already announced that if
something didn't happen by this date
which is sunday i guess
that they'll just stop the downloads and
start
start blocking these apps now let me ask
you this
would joe biden have done this do you
feel
any chance that joe biden would have
blocked a tick tock
and i don't know if anybody's asked him
so i asked on twitter has anybody asked
joe biden would you block tick tock if
you were president would you stop
wechat i'd love to hear his answer on
that because i think he'd have a little
trouble answering it
being being relatively more pro-china
than
than trump is you know and i gotta say
i've said this a number of times and
every time you see another example of it
it strengthens the point
trump is bad at doing easy stuff
easy stuff being anything that joe biden
can do
if joe biden is capable of doing it
that would be in the category of easy
stuff in other words showing up
reading from a teleprompter and not uh
and not getting everybody mad
so trump likes to provoke people so he
doesn't do the easy stuff well
but the impossible stuff you know peace
in the middle east
uh shaking hands with uh kim jong-un
you know moving out of uh china
decoupling from china
these are things which you would have
thought were kind of impossible
but he doesn't and i would say that this
banning tick tock
i actually can't even imagine another
president doing it
i can imagine another president
complaining
but i can't see anybody just you know
whacking
the most popular app among children in
the united states and just saying you
know
yeah i know you love it i know you
really like this kids
and goodbye just just get rid of it
i just love that it's so decisive it
doesn't seem like
it's real
all right um i've asked on twitter and
waiting to see the responses
who can give me the most persuasive data
you know a source a link or something
for
whether masks work or don't work
and i can't tell you how unhappy i am
that i'm asking this question in
september
because this was sort of a january-ish
february question right do masks work
how is it we don't know that now now of
course most of you are saying
scott scott we do know that
we do know that it's the most known
thing in the world
and then half of you will say yes we
know it
they work and then the other half of you
are saying scott
it's the most well-known thing in the
world it's been debunked a thousand
times
it doesn't they don't work
i would have thought by now that
an independent-minded person at least as
much as i can
muster would be able to look at those
two arguments
and come to some kind of a conclusion
based on the data i have my own opinion
based on my own thinking
but i should be able to look at the
sources and say oh okay these are good
ones
these are bad ones or it's ambiguous or
something
but instead there's a little magic trick
that
people are doing to themselves to fool
themselves
it goes like this if you think you saw a
lab
test that says masks don't work you
didn't see anything
you didn't see anything a lab cannot
test
whether these work for the coronavirus
if you think
a lab test which maybe shows that the
virus is smaller than
the holes in the mask or it shows that
the air comes out the side
if you think that kind of test tells you
something you're really wrong those
those are non-credible tests
and here's my argument if i'm talking to
you
from let's say four feet away without a
mask
my mouth cannon is shooting my virus
directly at you
in one stream
so i'm basically just dosing you with
virus
if i have the virus compared to i'm
wearing a mask
that laboratory tests say hey
those masks are letting stuff out the
side
is is the virus that i'm sending as a
cannon directly into the mouth
of the person i'm talking to because
when you talk to somebody
you literally face your mouth at their
mouth
right that's the most common way to talk
to somebody face to face
mouth to mouth are you telling me that
the same amount of
viral load because it does matter how
much you get
we're not talking about whether one
virus gets through
because it makes a big difference if you
get a big viral load
or a small one are you telling me the
viral load is the same if it comes out
the side
as if i can and shoot it right into your
mouth
if you can tell me that's true because
you studied it in a laboratory i'm just
going to say you don't know how things
work
you can't study that in the laboratory
it's never been studied
common sense tells you that friction
works every time it's hard to imagine
where friction doesn't work
at least a little bit now i
here here's the evidence that i would
take to be reliable
if you take any one country and say hey
this one country either did or did not
use masks
and they did or did not get a good
result useless
completely useless
all right one country doesn't tell you
anything
a bunch of countries if you could
collect the basket of countries
that had maybe a lot of other
differences but the one thing they all
had in common this basket
was that they used masks and they were
really dedicated about it
could you compare that to the people who
had lots of other things that are
different
but the one thing that was common is
they didn't use masks
just see how they did i would consider
that
beginning to be credible if you can't
show me that link
you're not in the conversation and i'm
not in the conversation either because
i've never seen that evidence
of all the the dumbass graphs and
bad statistics and stupid data that i've
seen on twitter and it's a lot
why have i never once not even once
seen anybody present something that said
here are the countries that use masks
well
here are the ones that didn't how they
do compared to each other
why have i never seen that isn't that
the most important piece of data
and and nobody can collect that data
it's the most
obvious thing
somebody says there's no canon coming
into their mouth
well maybe there is you just don't know
it
so um this uh this old mask thing really
shows
how bad humans are at understanding
anything logical or rational and i'm
telling you i don't understand
you know i've got this gigantic hole but
i feel like
we all do all right uh let me give you
an update on my
smart democrat friend i give you updates
as i
every day we go back and forth and i'm
chipping away at him
to try to make his trump derangement
syndrome a little bit
less and i have successfully moved him
from
the following position where he used to
say
trump is a big old serial liar he lies
he lies and lies
and that's why i like joe biden because
he's not like that
so every time joe biden lies
and according to joel pollock he counted
uh
in i guess in the town hall last night
there was one
answer just one answer that biden gave
which included five lies in one answer
so so biden is sort of like a gatling
gun of lies at this point because
you know all of his campaign ads are
lies
he just did a public service thing where
he
spread the fine people hoax again
to to a jewish audience i mean just the
worst thing you could possibly do as a
human
it's not even just the worst thing you
could do as a candidate
what joe biden is doing by spreading the
fine people hoax
is one of the worst things you could do
as a human
just as a human there's nothing that
trump has ever done
that's in that class and trump's done
some doozies right
trump's insulted some people you know
you know the list
right nobody is unaware of what trump's
alleged and actual offenses are but
biden
i mean that's the worst thing i've ever
seen in public
i've never seen any public figure
uh look let me think about this we'll
just say presidents
name any president who's done something
worse
than spread the fine people hoax
repeatedly
during during a time when the country is
divided
um you know you'd say oh what about
nixon and watergate and i would say
not even close not even close uh
carl bernstein can you go over here no i
guess you don't work on this side
he only does he only does it when it's
bad for trump
but if you were being even a little bit
objective
watergate was sort of you know a bad
thing
that maybe had no real impact on the
country in the end
except for the the president left but
the impact of the fine people oaks
is it's like pouring acid on a baby it's
just the worst thing
you could ever imagine can you get that
get that image out of your head um
so i've convinced my smart democrat
friend
that his original position that biden
was a truth teller
roughly speaking and trump was a big old
liar
is closer to two people in a political
contest they're just both lying all the
time all right
if you want to tell me that trump only
tells the truth
and his campaign ads i would say well i
don't think you know what a campaign ad
is
a campaign ad in 2020
doesn't try to tell the truth that's not
even
that's not even slightly you know
on the table as something anybody needs
to do and it's not just the president
it's just anybody running for office
so apparently as long as it's legal to
lie
in a campaign ad people have figured out
it's just easier to
shade the truth than it is to tell the
real truth all right
um the president did something i guess
yesterday
that might be one of the most important
things he'll ever do
and it will it will get the the least
amount
what does somebody say the birth
certificate no the the birth certificate
let me divulge i think there's somebody
here who's trying to argue
that uh that trump claiming the birther
thing about obama
might be bad as the fine people hoax
here's the difference and it's a big
big difference the birther thing
had nothing to do with race the only
race that was injected into that
was from the media and from the
democrats the democrats are responsible
for the birth of the thing because
let me clarify trump is of course
responsible for
raising the issue but he never raised it
as a racial issue
it's the same issue he would have you
know he would have
because he did the same thing with ted
cruz you know he would have raised the
same issue
if hillary clinton had any irregularity
on her birth certificate
there's nobody alive who can tell me
with a straight face
you know if hillary clinton had been in
that situation
with any kind of question that you could
make about the
eligibility i don't think trump would
have mentioned that
because she is white nobody believes
that
the entire racial component of
birtherism
is an invention of the press and and the
enemies of republicans
now were there republicans who were
thinking
hahaha it's because he's black i doubt
it
i doubt it in have you met
i've spent a lot of time with
republicans the last several years
talking about politics and stuff a lot
of time and a lot of it is private
and people will tell me things that they
won't say you know out loud
and people will tell me even just
horrible you know
thoughts that they would never let
anybody hear i hear everything
because people kind of trust me not to
judge them
which is true i tend not to judge people
in person
and or any other time usually
but
all right i'm just looking at your
comments and it's throwing me off here
all right so the point is that there's
nothing worse than the find people hoax
and i would argue that the democrats are
the ones who turned
the birther thing racial that wasn't
trump
um so trump has signed this thing the uh
do do it's the executive order for a
patriotic
to create a national commit commission
to promote patriotic education
and this is somewhat a replacement for
or at least a a counter to the so-called
1619 project which
tried to reframe history in
through the lens of slavery now
i happen to think that's that the 1619
project
could have been really good you know if
if it had been executed correctly i
would say that would have been a plus
because i would love to have you know
our our kids should be educated to know
what world war ii was
they should know that the holocaust
happened you know that
they should know slavery they should
know the details about
it so you know it was a good
idea but the way it was actually just
turned into a racist
nightmare which would destroy the
country so
i've said that the the way we train our
kids
is the operating system for the country
so the the way you program children it
becomes their operating system and they
can't run
any other apps unless they get that
right if you don't get the children
brainwashed i like to say because i want
to make sure you know exactly what i'm
talking about
brainwashed if you don't brainwash
children
you're just giving up your future
because there's no alternative to it you
don't let children raise themselves
that's not a thing right you can't let
children say you know
i was going to raise you and give you
some values but
i think i'll just let you work it out
just do it on your own
we know what happens when that happens
so
when president trump signed this
executive order
to um to look into i guess the national
commission will
come up with proposals i don't know
what's going to come out of it but let's
say that this is productive and it
produces
patriotic education i would say that's
one of the most
important things that this president
will accomplish in his entire
terms and i don't think it'll ever get
any
attention because only people like me
who see
the world in terms of persuasion and you
know
operating systems etc you'd have to have
a certain filter on life to know that
this
is the most important thing that this
president will ever do
i think so i think it's more important
well you know anything short of you know
avoiding i guess nuclear war
this is probably the most important
thing and
i don't think this would have happened
under joe biden do you
do you think that joe biden would have
instituted some kind of
patriotic education or would he have
continued pushing even harder
on the 1619 kind of racist
framework i think he would have we would
go on full racist
as as is the current situation all right
imagine being the author of that 1619
project and learning that the president
of the united states
is so worried about how corrosive it is
that he's treating it like a disease
yeah how would you like to wake up in
the morning like ah
oh it's what's happening today waking up
let's see what's in the news
uh what's in the news is that my life's
work the thing i'm most
noted for is being treated by the united
by the president of the united states as
sort of a disease
that he's trying to get rid of
that's what you call not your best day
although i would imagine that the author
and
people beyond that think that it's still
quite wonderful
um as kurt schlichter said on
on twitter he said that somehow the
president managed to get
the entire democrat group the
establishment
to publicly unite against educating our
children about the greatness of america
and it's kind of perfect isn't it
the president given that he knows that
whatever he does will be opposed
he just keeps picking out things like
you know puppies and patriotism and
apple pie
and the democrats are like all right
we've got to be against puppies now we
like puppies but we're going to have to
be against puppies now
so now they're against presumably
they'll be against this
so they'll be against education and
telling kids that their country is good
um
so the other thing that biden lied about
last night was
he said that the the president quote has
yet to condemn the far-right
and white supremacists and of course the
fact-checkers
tear him apart because he has in fact
condemned
white supremacist and racist a number of
times in public
and biden will just act like it never
happened
uh does does uh let me ask you this
does trump ever tell a lie of that kind
it feels like that's a biden kind of a
lie biden will tell a lie where he'll
just say
trump said he wants to shoot all babies
and everybody will look around and say
that never happened
that just never happened
whereas trump doesn't really make up
things that
biden said does he as much i i'm
you'll probably come up with an example
because in the political season
everybody's doing that i suppose
but if i feel as though trump says stuff
like you're losing it or you're
you're going to be a socialist or you're
when he makes a claim there's at least
something to it
so when the president says joe biden
you're against
fracking even though joe biden is trying
to
tap dance and say no no no i'm i'm sort
of against fracking
but i'm not really against fracking well
i'm i might be against it in the future
but i'm not so much against it now well
not on federal land of course
and yeah you can still frack because we
need a transition but you can't do any
new fracking
so it just ends up being pretty close to
what the president said
whereas when biden makes up a lie it
just didn't even happen
it's not it's not close to what trump
said
to claim that he said maybe we should
drink bleach
that's not close that's not that's not
in the ballpark
when trump says talks uh says biden soft
i'm fracking
and he maybe exaggerates it a little bit
just a little bit
you know what's going on there like you
can it's kind of transparent
okay he's he's giving the extreme
version biden's
softening it but they're basically
talking about the same thing
now the fine people hoax is literally
just made up
drinking bleach just made up what was
the
the other one that he called cold
soldiers uh
losers and suckers totally out of
context
made up just made up
these are different um
uh just so i'm spreading the criticisms
around
the fox news is making something out of
kamala harris laughing about the
statement that
parents want their kids to go back to
school so there's a little clip
in which kamala does her uh over laugh
you know that awkward where she laughs
too much but what she said was
that everybody wants kids to go back to
school and then she laughed too hard
so it makes it look like she's crazy or
demented or something
but the joke obviously because she was
looking at somebody when she said it
the joke was that parents of course want
to get their kids out of the house and
back to school
every parent maybe not every parent lots
of parents
want their kids to go back to school and
then she laughed about that because
you know every parent laughs about it'd
be good to get the kids out of the house
to go to school
so that's all it was that's all it was
she was just laughing at something that
people would laugh at normally
she just overlaps but somehow that
became a clip to damn her
um by the way
you know we we've seen now two different
uh
videos of kamal harris getting off her
jet
for from the campaign and walking across
the tarmac
to a car and it's this low angle that
makes her look a little more impressive
you know it's just the way they film it
but one of them was wearing these what
these chuck maddens or whatever they are
shoes and everybody got a little excited
oh she's running for
vice president and she wears cool
footwear
whoa and then she repeated it
so they did the same camera angle same
setup but with
wheat wheat timberlands or something
like that some other kind of cool
cool issue and on one hand
i said to myself well that's the
most empty vacuous stupid thing you
could be
you know focusing on in somebody's
footwear
but when i saw this second one i said to
myself
it's not bad it's not bad because
remember
you know the the whole point of the uh
the campaign
is to make you feel a certain way it's
not really an intellectual process who
you're voting for it's who you feel
do you like seeing president trump
always wearing a suit
unless he's golfing i guess but the fact
he's always in a suit
yes oh it's uh chuck taylor's not chuck
madden's i don't know why she wear
thanks for correcting me
chuck taylors are the name of the shoes
and it's timberlands
wheat wheat timberlands are the other
kinds of shoes she wore
so here's my take on it she looked
really good in in the way they filmed it
and wearing the you know interesting
footwear
it was just a real good angle it was a
it was a strong look
because she's coming off a jet going to
a limo
she's being treated as special i thought
it was really good
somebody says she's five foot two really
yeah i
i would say that that was surprisingly
well done
because it just makes you feel kind of a
little bit positive
toward her just because she's
fashionable and if you think that
being fashionable doesn't count
you're wrong you're wrong being
fashionable
absolutely makes a difference voters do
respond to stuff like that
um uh here's another
biden fact check he says that uh trump
called covet 19 a hoax
no just didn't happen just another thing
he completely made up
yeah he took something from a different
context but he
totally made it up all right here's
here's three things that i think need to
be uh
figured out by the press and by the
public so i asked people to fact
check me on these three points because
every time i watch the news it feels
like they're talking
past these facts so they're so we're
letting the news make us think past the
sale
so i'm backing him up to the sale and
here are the three things i think we
should
find out if they're true i think they're
true
but i'm asking for a fact check and
nobody has debunked it yet that i saw
number one is it true that congress
ignored the virus
to focus on the doomed impeachment the
theater
this is something chris rock was saying
uh chris rock was blaming congress
you know he in his framing of it uh
trump is a child
so congress should have you know known
that the virus was something they needed
to work on
but they were focused on the impeachment
which was doomed and stupid
from the beginning now when i say
congress
ignored the virus that's a little
overstatement right because
not completely ignored because i guess
they had some kind of a hearing
about the virus in congress now
congress has a hearing about the virus
were they as informed at least informed
enough
compared to what the president knew at
the same time
is it a fact that key members of
congress
both democrats and republicans were
completely aware of the virus risk
with the same information at about the
same time as president trump
true or false because we didn't see
congress doing much
did we why why would the president be
blamed for quote not taking it seriously
which is just crazy talk
if congress also knew about it at the
same time
and didn't seem to be doing anything in
fact they were focusing on impeachment
that's just true right is that is
anything i said there not true
all right how about this one trump
followed his his expert's advice
all the way with no exceptions
for a while i thought it was an
exception that um
i thought that nobody agreed with trump
about closing
uh china travel even though it wasn't
totally closed
but it turns out fauci says yes he was
he was
asked about it and he agreed so as far
as i know
there are no examples of fouchy and
burks
giving president trump different advice
than what he ended up doing
that's the most important question of
the election have you seen anybody deal
with that in the news
i haven't i haven't seen fox deal with
it i haven't seen cnn deal with it
i haven't seen it but it's the most
important question
give us an example where trump did
something either too late or different
because even timing could be part of it
that wasn't what the
experts told them to do if you can't
come up with that
then then the problem is that the
experts weren't right
do we blame the experts for not being
right
i hope not i hope not because
we should be adult enough to know that
our experts were doing the best they
could
and they were world experts they were
genuinely
genuinely had all the capabilities it's
just that
there were a lot of unknowns there was a
little bit of guessing involved
right so i don't blame the experts but
you certainly can't blame the person who
took their advice
when that was the only smart thing to do
how about this
true or false this is my statement trump
never had an option to test our way out
of the virus the way some other
countries did
so my claim is that a few other
countries because of special cases
they did have an option to be aggressive
on testing and
and tracking and it could make a
difference
but that because the united states is
not only bigger and has more travel and
it just has a lot more variables
but also we didn't have tests
south korea had tests because one
private company
ramped up before they they were asked to
so somebody did something smart but it
wasn't the government
it was a private company who thought
they could make some money and jumped
into it
whereas i believe that the story is that
our test
kits were defective but nobody knew it
so if you got a late start because your
experts didn't know their test kits were
bad
would that not have happened in the
obama administration
would would president obama have been
sitting in his office in the oval office
and looking at his day's work when
there's no pandemic
it's just just a day it was president
obama going to say you know
what we need to do is fill up our
warehouses with ppe
did that happen that didn't happen
trump didn't do it obama didn't do it
nobody ever did it
didn't happen um how about
did obama say to himself you know uh my
esp is telling me
that the test kits we're going to put
together if we have a pandemic
i don't think they're going to work we
better
you know do some kind of a big program
now to get them to work
against the virus that hasn't been
discovered yet
how do you test it before you have a
virus yeah
so here's the thing clearly the united
states did not do well on testing
i think we can all agree on that right
you don't have to be a republican or
democrat
to say the u.s did not do good on
testing but whose fault was it
was that the president was he in the
laboratory with the
with the mixing up the chemicals and
he's like i think i got it now
that looks about right ship it guys i
don't think that happened
i i think that the president had an
expectation
that the lifetime professionals working
there would get it right
they didn't now was it their fault
well i think you'd have to dig in quite
a bit to find out what went wrong
it could be that whatever went wrong was
something that nobody could have seen
you know it could have been just a weird
coincidence bad accident kind of thing
you don't really know the details of
that
all right so if we could find out those
three things
uh did congress ignore the virus too at
the same time with the same knowledge
did trump follow all of his expert
advice or did he depart from it at any
time
in an important way and number three did
trump
ever have the option that other
countries had
of testing their way out because the
others the ones that did it had
something special going on in each case
all right um
and as i predicted a few months ago
i said don't compare the united states
to europe
and other countries just yet because
those other countries are not done
they're not done just because they got
on top of it early
and really really put a lid on it look
like
as soon as they open up international
travel
that's it there's no such thing as
containing the virus
in one country that's not a thing unless
you keep the
borders closed and that's not
sustainable
so sure enough exactly as every one of
you should have been able to predict
but for whatever reason at least in the
news people weren't
uh there's a big increase in cases
um since september in europe
and uh france is absorbing 10 10 000 new
cases a day
and it says from one report that the
second wave
might be hitting differently than the
first wave in other words
the second waves might give them quite a
whack
so gotta wait till the end you know if
if the us death rate continues to plunge
but europe takes off again are they
going to be so lucky
i don't know have to wait
i think the dumbest comment that anybody
could make in public
is that trump didn't take the virus
seriously
because first of all that's mind reading
you're assuming that you know somebody's
state of mind how seriously they took
something
and now we've got this former pence
advisor
is going public against trump and says
that he
didn't take the virus seriously he was
only interested in election
that is a child's view
if you hear that you don't even hear you
don't even need to hear
the rest of it if somebody tells you
that there was a president of the united
states
who didn't take a pandemic seriously and
only cared about election
just stop listening to that person
they're they're not a person who should
be listened to
because they don't know what the
president's feeling on the inside
and objectively speaking he took it
deadly seriously
he closed traffic from china now
yes he should you know maybe closed it
more aggressively or sooner or whatever
but you can't argue that he took it
seriously he did the most serious thing
you could do and early and he did it for
exactly the reason that it was serious
and he said out loud i'm gonna tell
people
you know the good the the rosie review
but i'm taking it seriously it's deadly
so so making a story
out of this woman and i'm going to be
cruel here here for a minute
because i feel like i i have a free
a free shot yeah i wouldn't do this in
every situation
but when you have somebody who's willing
to put themselves personally
by their name i first of all i
appreciate it when somebody's
giving their real name so we'll give her
credit for that
name olivia troy who was the
mike pence employee who turned on the
president
publicly so i'll give her credit for
doing it publicly and with her own name
we should always give people credit for
that because that you know that's
that's invested you know these are not
drive by
people these are people who are taking a
chance
a big chance with their own lives and
reputations
for apparently they think they need to
but
if they're taking a chance to get the
wrong thing well that's a problem
um here's the thing
i i'm gonna be consistent and say that i
can't read the inner thoughts
or feelings of a stranger exactly the
way
olivia troy can't read the inner
thoughts and priorities of president
trump it's just not a thing
can't see in people's heads so i don't
know what she's
actually thinking or how she actually
feels
i can only tell you as an observer what
does the situation make me feel
so i'm only talking about myself that's
the only part i can talk about
authoritatively
and when i see her talking
she doesn't look mentally stable
which is completely different than
saying she is not mentally stable
right because i'm not making that claim
because i don't know her
right she had a high-end job you know
all the evidence suggests that she's
perfectly functional because she had a
high-end job and
she had security clearance you know
probably well-educated
so i'm only telling you how it how i
i receive it and i don't know why but
they seem to pick
people for this kind of a role who just
have
a vibe about them that says there's
something wrong
and that it doesn't have anything to do
with the president
do you get that i'm looking at your
comments to see if i'm the only one
now before you jump on me and say scott
scott scott
i think you're just being a little
sexist
would you say that about a man scott
if if this had been a man would you say
looks a little unstable yes
yes yes i would say that about a man
that's weird my light just went out by
itself of course i would say that about
a man so
alexa turn on studio
huh my light just died on me well we
might be a little bit in the dark here
um
all right that's all i got here i'm
going to make a prediction just so you
have something to track
here's here's my prediction that by the
end of the year in that december january
time frame the news will start to report
that the old regular flu you know the
one that we've been told kills 50 to
thousand people a year
that the news by the end of this year
will be that that was never
real it's a pretty big prediction isn't
it
that the most common thing everybody
knows to be true
universally believe to be true that
fifty two thousand
fifty to eighty thousand people a year
will die from the regular flu
i am now predicting but that by the end
of this year
that will no longer be considered a fact
it will be modified somehow it just
won't be
true anymore and i say that because you
can only go so long
denying your own eyes all right i i'm
always willing to believe the science
and the statistics and the experts first
that's my first impulse like oh all the
experts say that's true
okay how many experts say that all of
them
really so pretty much all of the experts
are saying the same thing
okay very convincing you know you you
have my attention
but what happens if you wake up every
day and the thing they say is true
you don't see and you should see it
in other words if they said all the
experts say
it's going to rain every day where you
live
and you say all right all the experts
say it's going to rain every day
and then i wake up and it's not raining
they go okay
well you know one day it didn't rain
that doesn't mean they're wrong wrong
it just means you know slightly wrong
maybe could be a lot of other days it
rains
then you wake up the next day and it's
not raining again
how many days do you wake up and it's
not raining
before you say you know all the experts
who said it rains every day
maybe they're not right well that's
where i'm at now
the fact just do the math here
let's say at the low end 50 000 people
have died
a year died of the regular flu
so take 50 000 a year
and multiply it by my 63 years of life
but let's say i wasn't really paying
attention until i was you know
13. so let's say just 50 years
alexa what is 50 times 50 000
50 50 000 is 2.5 million
so i should have seen 2.5 million people
or not seen them but there should have
been 2.5 million people who died over my
lifetime
that i should have noticed right i
should have noticed
a friend of a friend somebody's cousin
but 200 000 people have died in this
country
and we all have noticed we all know
somebody who knows somebody
right don't you all know somebody who
knows somebody or at least you've seen
somebody in the news or whatever
how how can it be that this regular flu
is killing people like crazy
and we just never notice the only time
we notice is
when it's this flu it's possible it's
real
but i'm going to stick with my
prediction that it
has never been real um
and here's my hypothesis that there is
danger from the flu
but uh the the reason they say that so
many people are dying from it
has a lot to do with making sure you get
the vaccination
that's what i think i think has to do
with getting the vaccination
i don't think it has to do with reality
somebody says they may be very old could
be
could be that they're very old but i
know a lot of old people have died
over the course of my life i know quite
a bit of people who have died from old
age
none of them died from the flu that i'm
aware of
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
