Hello, YouTube. Let's see if this works.
We had a little technical difficulty before. I'm just going to do one topic on this one. It's about China, and it's based on an unscientific poll that was done by ChinaFile.

They talked to 121 people who were China-connected. They were scholars and journalists and former diplomats, etc. They asked them if they were likely to visit China after the pandemic restrictions were off, and 40 percent of them said they probably or definitely would not.

Some of them were concerned about their safety—being jailed on trumped-up charges. Some of them were afraid of... who knows what.

But I would say that the best way to take down China is by the following sentence: China is not safe for business.

Because risk is different in each domain. In the military, risk means something very different—you might want to take a big risk in the military if there's a big reward, or you just have to.

In your personal life, you might take risks with your hobbies and your extreme sports and stuff. That's common—people do that in their personal life.

But in the domain of business, people don't like risk. Because if you take a risk in business, and it's a risk everybody knows is a risk—it's a well-known risk—and it doesn't go well, what happens?

You get fired. Or you look like an idiot.

So once it becomes known—or just a standard business phrase—that China is not safe for business in a variety of ways, then that should pretty much put business China out of business.

It will take a while. But once other countries realize that the risk of IP theft, the risk of imprisonment, the risk of spying, the risk of them getting access to your communications—it's just not worth doing business in China. Because these risks are so well-known.

If you take a risk that's not known, and it doesn't work out—well, you know, nobody's going to fire you for that. You took a risk, it didn’t work out. Nobody knew.

But if you know that working in China is not safe, and it doesn't work out—you get fired.

This used to be the case with using IBM equipment.

Back a million years ago, when I worked in the corporate world, it would be said that if you bought hardware from IBM, you'd never get fired. Because it either works, or IBM comes in and makes it work. But it’s always going to work. So you're not going to get fired because it didn’t work—IBM will take care of that.

Their competition? Well, the competition might give you a better price, but you don’t know for sure it’s going to work. Because they’re not IBM.

That was the thinking back then. Now things probably have changed.

But once that becomes a thing—once it becomes known that something has a risk to it—it’s really chilling in the business world.

And China has gone way beyond the point where you could say that it’s safe.

So that's the point.

I would just like to say one other thing to the people complaining about the audio: just remember, Jesus is King.

The audio is fine—even when it's not. Because sometimes it’s not. But I also don’t care. So there’s your tip for taking down China.

And I wanted to test to see if the reason I had technical difficulties before was because of the content, or because of the technology. So this will be a test of that.

So that’s how to destroy China: just make it a well-known fact that China is not safe for business, which is completely true. Completely true. So you don’t have to lie about anything.

And there you are—there’s your kill shot for China.

And China, if you're listening—and I think you might be—you really shouldn’t have killed my stepson with fentanyl.

You're up there. Because I'm coming for you.

And if you don’t get me first, I’m going to take down your whole country.

So: China is not safe for business. And that is something you’re going to see a lot more of in the next month.

And I will talk to you tomorrow.
