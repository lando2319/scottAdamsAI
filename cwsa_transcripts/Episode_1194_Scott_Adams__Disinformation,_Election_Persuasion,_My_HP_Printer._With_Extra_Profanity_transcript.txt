oh i didn't notice you there
hey everybody good to see you good to
see you
you know every morning when i am in your
company
i feel good true story
you know this is the only thing i've
ever done that
is job-like that doesn't feel
anything like work because because this
stuff that i do
i i literally do it for fun and i look
forward to it every morning so i hope
some of you
enjoy it and you might enjoy it more
with a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea's die in a canteen jugger flask
a vessel
of any kind any kind really
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now once again
for an unbroken string of unparalleled
goodness it's called the simultaneous
sip
and it happens right now go
well let's talk about my printer
if you've been joining me on these live
streams lately
you know i've had a little trouble with
it a little bit of trouble with it
but here's an interesting update it
turns out that when you complain about
your
uh hp printer in public
eventually the word of that complaint
will reach
the hp executive
escalation team so i got a phone call
i'm driving yesterday get a phone call
in my car
and it's a hewlett power hewlett packard
saying
uh we hear you having problems with your
printer
so so the escalation team if you're not
familiar with
uh big corporation uh processes
it's very common for a big corporation
to have a small group
who does exactly this they look for
prominent complaints for you the kind of
complaints that would get into the
public
and cause you know a public relations
problem
and they looked at they looked to stamp
out those prominent
complaints with a special team it's
actually
very smart uh when i worked for pacific
bell we had
we had the same thing we had a rapid
response team for
for the big the big complaints that
could get out of hand
so hp contacts me and offers to
set me up with a tech support to solve
my problem
so we arranged a call and the tech
support guy
calls and walked me through a fairly it
was pretty complicated to
sign on and solve it but the first part
of the solution goes like this
tech support says go to this web page
type in this url
and then you know click these buttons
and i'm just doing what i'm told right
so i go to my computer and i'm
going to the web page and i i feel like
it's going to be something like
download this driver or something like
that
but just before i click i realize that
the thing i'm going to click on
is going to turn over control of my
computer to the stranger on the phone
and i'm like and my finger just jumps
back when i realize what i'm about to
click
i do believe that it was hp so
i don't really i don't really disbelieve
that hp was on the phone and and indeed
they solved the problem
and then followed up so i'm sure it was
hp
but as a general rule if you let a
stranger
on the telephone give can get control of
your computer
don't do that better than that
pick your computer up and throw it out
your window
and then you know destroy it with a
hammer and buy a new one
but don't give strangers control of your
computer
just just don't do that i realize i just
made a lot of people's
tech support problems much harder but
don't do that
so i didn't need to do that you know he
just talked me through what i needed to
do
changed the drivers and it works fine
look at this
paper paper so uh
instead of throwing my printer off of
the balcony as i was going to do
let me give a shout out to hp who every
once in a while you see a big
corporation do something
exactly right that's what they did it
was exactly right
the way they handled it could not have
been
more perfect so my compliments to hp
all right here's a fun thing that might
be ahead
assuming biden takes office as many
people believe
now i don't think that's guaranteed but
let's just work with me here
if biden takes office he's going to be
walking into a buzz saw
that i don't think he sees coming and it
looks like this
trump was able to get the republican
party to rally around him
eventually i don't know that democrats
are going to be able to pull that off
you know the left and the right i think
that now that they
think they won they're going to turn
their attentions on each other
and you know and start chewing on each
other so
biden will have only let's say half or
two-thirds of the democratic party
the other third will be trying to kill
him he won't
have republicans obviously fox news
breitbart
they're unlikely to be you know
pro-biden
so he's going to have that whole part of
the media against him a third or so of
his own team against him
and then here's the fun part how does
cnn stay in business
if all they do is puff pieces on biden
it made sense to do them when they did
them because they were trying to
manage a result to get him elected but
what happens if
if the dog chases the car and then
catches it
if the dog catches the car it doesn't
know what the to do with it
i promised you extra profanity there's
more coming
and so cnn is going to have a tough
choice
if all they do is well biden's awesome
again
look at that energy look at him go he
seems
more coherent than ever really how many
people are gonna watch that
nobody nobody's gonna watch it so
and it's not as fun to look at oh mitch
mcconnell
block this or that those are boring
stories right
you need a you need a trump to get some
energy into your
into your coverage binding doesn't have
any energy
so cnn will either have to go out of
business
which believe it or not is one of the
choices they're talking about you know
selling cnn
which is not exactly going out of
business but it isn't
it would be an acknowledgement that
their business isn't working
they need some kind of a larger
protector if you will
somebody with deep pockets so i think
the most likely thing that would happen
is cnn will turn
unbidden because they'd have to
they need to get ratings so biden is
going to have the left media against him
the right media against him
and a third of his own base against him
i don't think any president would ever
come into office
with more potential firepower aimed at
him
it's going to be brutal or it could be i
mean i suppose you could say that
cnn so doesn't care about profits
that they would rather you know just be
nice to him because
he's on their team maybe
but i feel like profits are pretty
important i feel as though the profit
motive will
cause cnn to turn on them and if you
believe the ai
already runs the world it's guaranteed
all right here's a question for you and
i genuinely don't know the answer to
this so it's not rhetorical
are republicans as bad as democrats
as people because it's i get a biased
view of it because most of my trolls
would identify as being left-leaning
and people on the right are generally
nicer to me
because they tend to agree with my
messages etc so what i don't know
is all things being equal if i if i were
not identified with a side
would republicans be as bad to me
just personally as as human beings as
the left
is because i don't feel like that would
be the case
but it might be right could i have a
blind spot
do i have a blind spot that just makes
me biased in front of
in favor of you know right leading
people
because i'll tell you my impression
which is not based on
science or data all right so i could be
completely wrong about this
and i'm aware that i could be completely
wrong but i'll tell you how i feel
i feel as if i often agree politically
philosophically with a lot of the things
that people on the left
say for example you know i think we
we ought to have something closer to
free college somehow i don't know how to
get there
we should have something closer to
better health care for everybody
i don't know how to get there either
math-wise
so i don't disagree with a lot of things
that they want
but it feels like conservatives and
republicans are nicer
people am i wrong about that
just nicer people so i would rather be
hanging out with conservatives who
disagree with me politically
than i would hanging out with leftists
who agree with me politically
they just seem unpleasant and i can't
tell if that's just
a weird bias i have or if it's actually
a thing
i mean i don't know it could be a thing
so i just put that out there i hope
you're not being as bad as them let me
give you some examples
um so i did a tweet and i'll talk to it
talk to you about it later in which i
got 10 000
retweets so getting 10 000 retweets
is a lot right if it for the size of my
account
would show massive agreement with what i
tweeted
20 000 likes right so this is the tweet
and there and by the way there's nothing
in it that's
controversial really and somebody
somebody comments obviously somebody
left dilbert guy
is trying so hard to be relevant
and i'm thinking to myself if you tweet
on the the topic of the day which is
the election controversy and you get
10 000 retweets and 20 000
likes and you're doing a popular live
stream
and somebody tweets dilbert guy is
trying so hard to be relevant
what does relevant look like to you
and let me let me back up a little bit
who is it who's not trying to be
relevant
is there anybody who wakes up in the
morning and says
you know i think today i will achieve my
goal of being irrelevant to the world
shouldn't you all be trying to be
relevant even if you're failing
wouldn't it be an honorable thing to be
attempting to be relevant
even if it didn't work right now i would
argue that objectively you can look at
the data
and you would say that it is working in
the sense that
lots of people are paying attention as
demonstrated by retweets and likes
they're actually acting on it you know
they're clicking something
so it's like this this
critic now you know obviously i don't
take any of the trolls too seriously
i'm more interested in the mindset and
understanding
like what's going on here what is this
critic trying to accomplish
it feels like it's just evil
there's no point to it it's just being
evil because it's a comment that's only
directed to make me feel bad
it didn't you know obviously i'm a
professional so
some little uh tweet isn't gonna make me
feel bad
but it makes me curious like what the
hell is wrong with you
that you would feel that this was a good
use of your time
all right here's another one so
i did a long tweet thread about the
brainwashing techniques that democrats
are using
i would say there's nothing in that
tweet thread that is even really
provocative
it's pretty much a routine analysis of
word
choice and how those word choices are
are persuasive or not
it's not even really political it's just
about
persuasion word choice and somebody
tweets at the denver post which is one
of my client newspapers
they tweeted the denver post with that
with my thread and say can we talk about
the dilbert guy
meaning that they would like to get me
kicked out of the denver newspaper
because i did a tweet that has no
provocative content
in it he just doesn't like it that's it
he doesn't like the tweet so he wants me
to lose my job
i didn't didn't say anything that was
even accused of being
offensive to anybody i was not accused
of being
inaccurate about anything
so i'm not being accused of being wrong
or offensive or dangerous
or anything he just didn't like my
opinion
and he thinks i should lose my job over
that that's
that's where we're at now are
republicans like that
i don't i don't think so but i could be
wrong all right
so today like every other day there's
something that happens to me every
single
day and it goes like this
hey scott here's a very credible study
that says wearing masks doesn't work
doesn't work at all followed by
somebody else hey scott here's a study
and lots of them that prove that masks
work definitely
every day every day
somebody sends me a a study that says
masks work
and one that says mass don't work and
they all look credible
to me what the hell do i know you know
half of studies get debunked eventually
but i can't tell so
i tell you the the concept of trusting
the experts is the stupidest
thing
in the public right now don't
trust experts why
is it because they're wrong no
it's because you don't know you can't
you can't judge
which expert is right let's say on them
ask
question because they're experts on both
sides you can't judge which of those
experts are right
with what your secret powers
you don't have any that none of your
five senses
have evolved to tell which expert
having opposite opinions with opposite
complex studies that you can't look into
even if you wanted to you can't
tell which expert is right
listen to the experts is the dumbest
 thing
in the whole world
do you know what else is as dumb as that
we we should not uh impugn the trust in
our institutions
you're hearing that a lot right if if
blah blah blah
trump does this or that it will cause
people to lose trust
in the election process
good good we should
lose all trust in our institutions
how about the news should you trust the
news
no don't trust the news ever
don't ever trust the news
don't trust the elections don't trust
the news don't trust congress
don't trust any elected official don't
trust any institution
don't trust your teachers unions
don't trust anyone
that's your healthy situation instead of
trust build a good system
put transparency into your system
do you know why i trust trump
more than let's say his critics do
because the presidency is probably the
most
transparent job in the whole world well
that's an exaggeration but
it's a super transparent job if he did
a lot of the things he would be accused
of the odds of detection
are close to 100 percent it's the most
transparent job ever take the election
should we trust the election next time
no
don't trust the next election
don't even trust it a little bit
if you're if your election professionals
have not added a whole bunch of
transparency
that isn't there now don't trust
it
don't trust this one don't trust the
next one now
will this lack of trust destroy
civilization will it destroy the country
no no because there's a thing we have in
this country
in america and i can't speak for other
countries it might be
you know maybe it's just true for a lot
of countries but there is a thing we
have here
in america that other people don't have
and that thing is super super strong
we're americans that's it
that's it we're americans
we're not going to break our
country
we're just not going to do it we don't
want to
we don't want to break america so we
won't
but we will break our
institutions
we will break any thing we have
to
to keep the country together all right
we don't care about our
institutions
nothing we do care about america
we will protect it we don't care
about our institutions
don't care about them all right
let's talk about the teachers unions i
believe
that like antifa antifa did a uh
did a very clever thing persuasion wise
antifa created a name for themselves
called
anti-fascist and then when people said
to them
as they obviously would hey aren't you
acting like
fascists and then antifa and then their
pets of the news say oh you fool
you fools we're acting like fascists
have you even seen the name of our
organization
anti anti
fascist so if you're against us
and we're anti
fascist logically
you would be a fascist and because
people are idiots that actually
works
they're actually people who think oh
that makes sense they're anti-fascists
if you're anti-anti-fascist oh
negative negative i guess you're a
fascist
now that kind of persuasion
shouldn't work but we observe that it
does
right because persuasion is about the
irrational process
it's not about anything that's rational
so i suggest
given that the teachers unions are the
poison
that is destroying civilization i don't
think that's too strong
is that too strong to say that the
teachers unions
are the poison destroying civilization
i feel like that's not even hyperbole
uh they they're the cause of or at least
the perpetuation
of systemic racism because if every
black kid had a quality education
do you think there would be as much you
know differences
in outcomes there wouldn't be as much
i mean i don't know if there would be
differences but it wouldn't be as much
so the teachers unions are by far the
most
uh evil pernicious part of life but i
think they should not be called
teachers unions and here's why
teachers are still good
all right when i talk about teachers
unions
i'm not talking about teachers you know
there may be some overlap
but i'm not talking about the person who
just you know dedicates their life to
teaching children and making their lives
better the teachers are fine
mostly you know they're not all great
but i'm not talking about the teachers
talking about the unions who are now
keeping kids
out of school in some places uh despite
science apparently and this is a
crushing blow to those children but the
teachers unions persist
so here's the name i would give them
because teachers sounds good
and union sounds good right just as
words
as independent words we generally
like unions right i don't think the
country would be nearly as well off
if unions had never existed but like
everything you can have too much of a
good thing
you know not everything is as good as
everything else
so rather than having a name at teachers
which is good
and unions which is generally good how
about
calling them the anti-child union
the anti-children union or anti-child
i can't decide if child or children is
better
but i think i'm going to call them the
hashtag anti-child union
because that feels closer to what's
happening right
the whole point of the teachers union is
to benefit
the teachers the whole point of school
is to benefit the children
are you with me school is to benefit
children
teachers unions are by design the
intention of them
is to benefit teachers are those the
same
no they're not they're not and if what's
good for the children
happens to be and let's say in this
coronavirus situation that might be the
case
bad for the teachers it creates a
situation where the teachers have to be
anti-child because that's their job
their job is to be pro-teacher and if
they
feel that the best way to do that is
also being anti-child
well they will be that's their mission
to be pro-teacher
all right
how about this
the you know one of the things that
trump uh gets a lot of heat for
is hiring sketchy people like you know
paul manafort
etc i don't need to go through the list
but
that takes some attention away from the
fact that some of his hires
are really spectacular for example i
think pompeo is doing a great job
in my opinion i think jared kushner gets
a lot of heat from conservatives
but didn't jared kushner do a great job
in the middle east
right i mean i think maybe a fantastic
job
and i would say that given all the heath
that uh
take all the heat that ivanka has gotten
you know
who's gotten more heat than ivanka but
four years have gone by how would you
say she did
pretty darn great what do you say lots
of accomplishments in terms of human
trafficking whole bunch of stuff
has she caused any problems nope
i would say that ivanka has been 100
positive everything she did that i know
of
looks like it worked out well and it was
nothing but good for the administration
good for the country
those are good hires but the one i
wanted to talk about is kaylee mcinnani
that's probably the best hire he's ever
made
what do you think about that i mean i
don't know how well
any cabinet member is doing it's not
like i have any visibility on that
but kelly mcinnady is
probably just about the best i've ever
seen
in that job and there have been good
people in those jobs i'm not
i'm not knocking anybody else who did
the job because they've been great
people in those jobs
fairly consistently over over history
but i think she's the best i'm seeing in
the comments a lot of agreement there
so yesterday i guess cnn's caitlin
collins was
shouting out questions uh to the nature
of why do
when when will president trump concede
and mackenzie's walking off and she just
goes uh
i don't call on activists i don't call
on activists
kind of a just a kind of perfect right
all right here's some fun
you could recall that during the trump
first term i often talked about how the
democrats were using what i called
laundry list persuasion i talked about
it in my
book loser think and maybe in win bigly
i can't remember
but laundry list persuasion works really
well
because it people will say to themselves
well
i'm not sure i believe everything on the
list
but there's so much on the list there
must be some truth to the general claim
so the way the democrats used it would
they say they'd say
trump is a racist and here's my laundry
list of all the reasons
but if you looked at the reasons they
all just sort of fall apart
so there's no reason on the list that
actually
can stand up to any scrutiny but because
it's a list
you think to yourself well i don't know
much about everything on the list
i can tell a few of them don't look too
real but hey it's a whole list
there must be something to it it's it's
a list
now i've told you that the way to debunk
that is to not try to go through the
entire list because you just can't do it
but you can say tell me the strongest
thing on the list
and i'll just debunk that one and if you
agree that
with my debunk then you could see that
if i've debunked the strongest reason on
the list
what does that say about the weak ones
all right so that that's
the setup for the laundry list so
what the
what's happening with the trump
administration right now as they're
challenging the election
they're using laundry list persuasion
against the election
and it's working now the thing about
laundry list persuasion
is it's really
let's just say it's not the most honest
thing you could do
but it works and in the political
process
if something's not quite exactly honest
but it works
it's going to happen so watching the
trump administration use
laundry list accusations about the
election
is is pretty fun but
there's a there's a catch what would you
let me ask you you viewers
in your opinion having heard lots of
different examples
of alleged election impropriety
which one of those is number one on your
list
for being not only likely true
but big enough to make a difference all
right
so i want to see in the comments what do
you think
is the is the one thing on the list that
really stands out
okay so i'm reading the comments i'm
saying software
dominion dominion software dominion
dominion dominion software software
software software software dominion
dominion divinity
okay so i think i've seen enough
to know that you believe
that the software mischief is the big
story
and if you were to present a list you'd
probably have lots of things on your
list
but you'd put that at the top right
well there's a problem
the software story sort of seems to be
hanging on this venezuelan whistleblower
right would you be nearly as convinced
with the venezuelan with the with the
software story
would you be convinced of that as much
without that whistleblower because i
don't think you would right
you kind of need a witness for some kind
something like that
and now you have this witness who says
he was in the room he saw it personally
in the venezuela situation so therefore
blah blah blah right here's the problem
have you ever heard of a thing called
disinformation
well you're going to hear about it now
in
big foreign not foreign but let's say
international relations
and interactions there's a thing called
disinformation
in which one country would intentionally
create a story that's not true
and present it to the public of another
country
so that they could deal with the the
fake thing and it would cause
some damage to their society one way or
the other
do you think that in an american
election
especially this one do you think that
there was any party involved
be they foreign or be they democrats
could be domestic or foreign was there
anybody who had an
interest in disinformation
yes you'd all agree with that right
they had an interest in doing it china
has an
interest in weakening the united states
whether they did it or not is a separate
question
do democrats have an interest in
disinformation
if it could help them get elected of
course
yes so we have we have the we know we
have the motive
and it's massive and it's everywhere
anybody who had the ability
to inject disinformation
there's a pretty high chance they tried
it all right
now what would it look like if they did
it
if you were let's say you were
professional you're not just a troll
trolls are putting disinformation into
the system all the time
but when trolls do it it's it's not
necessarily going to reach a high level
of
notice right because people know i came
from a troll
but suppose it comes from what look like
credible sources
or institutions what them
well then it looks kind of believable
doesn't mean it's true
but it's going to be more credible if it
comes from a good source
so what would it look like if let's say
democrats
had hired the best disinformation
professionals in the world and their
primary mission
was to make it look as though the
trump team's claims were illegitimate
what would you do how would you do it
given that the trump team is using
laundry list persuasion
and given that if you can debunk the
strongest
thing on the list you've kind of
debunked the whole list
not completely but it's the best you can
do what would you do what would be your
strongest
play your strongest play
would be to create a number one
issue that isn't real
and that would look like a venezuelan
whistleblower
if you were a disinformation
professional like really really good at
it
you'd say to yourself if we can
embarrass the trump team
with this one obviously claim
about a venezuelan whistleblower and we
can get people to think that that was
the main
claim we can debunk the whole
thing
and then you look at that claim and you
say to yourself uh
it looks exactly like disinformation
and it's in exactly the right place
for disinformation now
do i know for sure that somebody
injected disinformation into it and it
and it's that
in particular no no i do not
but i will tell you it looks exactly
like it
i will tell you that i'm not the one
person who noticed
let me let me give you an assignment
probably most of you could find at least
somebody who's involved or has been
involved in
let's say intelligent services
find somebody in your in your
environment
might be a friend of a friend or
something who actually understands the
disinformation
world tell them what i just told you
that i that there's at least a
possibility
that somebody wanted to ruin the laundry
list persuasion
of the trump legal team and that they
might have done it
by injecting this obviously
story about the venezuelan whistleblower
just ask them and then say is the
cartoonist
crazy or is this a thing
and then get back to me because it's a
thing
and the odds that it happened in this
election
whether it's this specific case or just
some other disinformation the odds that
happened are kind of a hundred percent
really they're kind of a hundred percent
we don't know what disinformation
necessarily
that's a different question but did it
exist
yes yes it just
it exists uh and probably came from
democrats more likely than foreign but
that's just
a feeling all right
what would the trump legal team do
if they suspected this was the case
because i've heard people say is sydney
powell
uh lying or does she have the goods
is she just making this story up
because you know we're waiting for the
the proof here's what i think is
happening
all right so i'm gonna this is pure
speculation i think that
sydney powell and the legal team does
not believe
the whistleblower just a guess
i haven't asked them that question i
don't know
my guess is that they don't believe it
but it is nonetheless true
that it has been presented to them in a
credible
ish package their job is to make the
president's case
as well as they can and so it would have
been
maybe irresponsible if they had not
included it
in the case because it exists
the claim is made by somebody who
might have been in the room so you sort
of have to at least put it out there
which is different from whether they
believe it themselves
my suspicion is that they at least have
a deepest skepticism
probably just a deep skepticism but they
still have to put it out there
remember the lawyers are working for a
client if the client says well
you know we don't know but put it out
there see what happens
now that's different from saying that
the software was unmolested
i still think there's 100 chance
the voting software gets compromised
sooner or later i don't know if it's
happened yet
but you can guarantee it will happen
it's there's no way to stop it really
eventually without transparency actually
transparency would be the one way to
stop it if you made the the code
available somehow to
everybody i suppose you could stop it
there might be some way to
technologically
do that
yeah somebody says release the damn
source code suppose they did
would you believe it was the real source
code and would you believe that they
don't have
uh patches and upgrades that can alter
the
the actions of the source code i think
even auditing the source code wouldn't
necessarily get you there i'd do it
but i don't think it would necessarily
be conclusive all right
here's uh so my tweet that i mentioned
that got all those retweets
i'm gonna run through it again quickly
because it's a
it's it's my laundry list if you will of
persuasion techniques that the democrats
are using i've mentioned these before so
i'll just do them quickly
they use refuses to concede that makes
you think past the sale
as though trump should should concede
we haven't accepted that but if they say
why won't he concede
they're making you think past the sale
that's persuasion they're calling a
simple recount an audit
to fool you into thinking they really
checked for fraud but and a recount
doesn't even do that
they're saying no evidence when in fact
there's tons of evidence in the forms of
affidavits
they just blunt you know they just
they just look you in the eye and say
there's no evidence
there's no proof because that ends up
happening in court or in a scientific
context
but evidence all kinds of evidence
so that's just persuasion they say it
would be obvious
if there was massive fraud but of course
republicans think it is obvious
how the hell did biden get that many
more votes than
obama it looks kind of obvious to a lot
of people even if it didn't happen
it looks obvious and then lawsuits being
tossed out of court
but of course the past does not predict
the future
the fact that somebody else lost
a uh somebody else lost a lawsuit
doesn't mean the next lawsuit is bad
that doesn't make any sense the fact
that other people lost
other lawsuits what does that tell you
about the next one
i shouldn't tell you anything but people
feel they see a pattern there
then there's the character assassination
by bad analogy which is
what you see when there's no real
argument so
it turns it into trump's legal
challenges or mccarthyism or
racism or dictatorism or something
and uh
and then of course what the media leaves
out
when when they can put anybody on camera
that says
there's no fraud or we have discovered
no fraud
what they leave out is the person saying
that didn't look for it
of course there's no evidence of
something you didn't
look for
and on that point the the two michigan
lawmakers who went to visit trump people
got pretty concerned because they said
hey
is he gonna talk them into not
certifying uh
the the election in their state and
they said and i want to find the exact
quote
because the exact quote matters
i do have that exact quote and you'll be
happy that you waited because it'll make
you so happy
um
i guess i hit it pretty well
well the exact quote which apparently i
didn't print
was that um the lawmakers said
they had not yet seen any evidence
of fraud in the election
did you did you catch the key word there
the key word was yet
who puts yet in a sentence like that
so the lawmakers say we have not yet
seen evidence that the election was
fraudulent
do you know how the news reported the
statement
we have not yet seen evidence
they take the yet out watch the yet
be dropped out of the news report
that yet is sort of an important word
because it left their options open
but the the headline in the the trending
part if you look at the trending on
twitter
they took the yet out now
let me ask you this would those two
lawmakers
be in a position as of yesterday
to have even potentially seen any
evidence of fraud
even if it existed no
no what's left out of the context is
why would you imagine that those two
specific lawmakers
would have seen any evidence of fraud
did sydney powell have a meeting with
them and show them what she has
no no
why would they have evidence of fraud so
they put in that word yet
as little place markers like not yet
and i would agree with them they they
have the same information i do all bat
they watch the news if you if all you
if all you know is what's on the news
and what's in social media
you also don't know
there's you know proof of uh fraud
you don't know you just see claims
you see claims you see debunks of those
claims and more claims
that's all you know you don't know if
there's any fraud
i don't know i believe there is because
the situation is one
in which fraud would happen every time
so
i don't know how much but of course it
exists
all right
have you noticed that there's something
weird about this virus that it seems to
attack
enjoyment is that just a coincidence
that the only thing you can't do in this
pandemic is enjoy yourself
because all the things that create
enjoyment are exactly all the things
you're not supposed to do
you can still work
right but you can still do everything
unpleasant
if it was unpleasant before you can
still do it
but if it's fun
no no fun
so that's kind of a weird virus
coincidence i don't know
maybe it's trying to teach us something
uh if you believe in the
the god model of reality
maybe it's a lesson you know
maybe you didn't need that fun you know
i'll tell you one of one of the weird
things that's coming out of this
is realizing what things didn't matter
and what things were just habits is
anybody having this experience
that you're learning something about
yourself that you
probably couldn't have learned without
the pandemic
for example um learning to appreciate
having toilet paper before the pandemic
did you ever look at your roll of toilet
paper there on the
on the little roller on the wall and
think to yourself
dear god thank you i never did
i always took my toilet paper for for
granted as well as my food and
transportation and health care and
everything else i feel i have a sense of
gratitude
for everything i have now
that exceeds anything i could have
imagined before
a little bit like maybe people went
through the depression the great
depression
you know if you had any parents or
grandparents who went through the great
depression
you notice they don't throw things out
like just in case
i've got this empty can well you know if
there's a great depression that might be
my
my beverage holder in the future so
i do feel as though there's something
weirdly
uh educational
about this this virus so
uh california's instituted a curfew from
10 p.m to 5 a.m
i understand the 10 p.m part i don't
really understand the 5 a.m part
because i don't know do people have a
different lifestyle than i do
because i can see being out to two in
the morning
i can see that happening i can't see
being out to five in the morning
i know it's a thing but
i feel as if you would if you had
stopped everything between
10 p.m and 3 a.m you probably would have
picked up most of the problems that
would have happened between 3 a.m
and 5 a.m because very people very few
people say you know
it's 3 a.m you don't want to go out and
have a drink
i don't know i feel as if they could
have maybe pulled that back to 3 a.m i'm
just
just saying uh harmeet dillon on
twitter has a solution because
apparently there's
a there's a rule that says that homeless
people are exempt
so you don't have a curfew if you're
homeless
and harmed asks what if you
self-identify as homeless
huh what if you do to which i add
it looks like this problem is going to
solve itself because if the biden
economy is anything like what we think
well we'll all be homeless so this
curfew might not matter
don jr is reportedly recovering from
covid if you want to see the worst of
humanity
look at the people celebrating don
jr on social media look at the people
celebrating and there's like
some some did a uh a happy dance
on tick tock to don jr having a disease
who does a happy dance to somebody
else's disease
i can't think of anybody i dislike that
much i mean really
i mean i could hate somebody pretty much
and short of being you know
like a i don't know actually hitler
i don't think i'd ever celebrate them
getting a disease
that's pretty sick i'm pretty sure don
jr will be fine he looks pretty healthy
so he should get by that just fine i
want to ask here's a question
have any of you uh felt
jealousy for somebody else
who was healthy and got the coronavirus
because i feel that a little bit and
it's not rational because you don't want
to get the coronavirus because it could
have
you know lasting problems that they say
for months
you don't know what the long-term
consequence is you don't know if you're
the
you know the rare person who dies from
it so
logically i definitely do not want to
get the coronavirus
logically but i'm not really a logical
creature
i'm i'm part illogical and the illogical
part of me the irrational part of me
is a little bit jealous anytime i see a
healthy person
get coronavirus because i assume that
they will recover with no problem
and then they have a little bit extra
freedom right they're a little less
afraid of things
they don't really need to wear a mask
you know they might for social reasons
but don't really need to
and i just wondered has anybody else had
that feeling
i'm looking at the comments and it looks
like literally nobody else had that
feeling
okay it's just me good thing i checked
it's just me all right so we wish the
best
for don jr speedy recovery
um breitbart had an article about
president trump's announcement about his
drug
changes drug policy changes so
we've got this most favored nations
thing and
uh and rebates and discounts would be
pushed directly to consumers instead of
to the middle
people and then there's this one line in
the story
that just sort of invalidates the whole
story
uh this was in breitbart i assume this
is general knowledge
and just this little throwaway sentence
that says
although the congressional budget office
estimates it could ultimately cost
taxpayers more
what now i don't think that's untrue by
the way
i do think that you can't just tell the
pharmaceutical company
we're going to pay you less from now on
and that everything's fine
because it would be sort of like
negotiating with your
car dealership if you get the car
dealership to go down
you know 500 on the price of the car
they're gonna charge they're going to
try to get it back with the you know the
car mats and the
the secret spray that protects the
undercoating of your car
so you think you won it's like i got
them down 500.
on the price of the car look at me
i got that 500 and then you just
give it back
with the secret undercoating and the
i don't know the every every
thing the car dealership does to screw
you
so i've got a feeling that the
pharmaceutical companies have lots of
game lots of i mean they have lots of
resources
they're very smart they're going to
figure out a way to re-screw us
even though these rules look like they
would be in the short run
for our benefit so i would like to be
way more optimistic
about drug prices coming down and that
it not
hurting us in other ways but i don't
feel as if it's that simple
and i don't know what the uh
congressional budget
office uh is thinking about it when they
say it could ultimately cost taxpayers
more
but i don't doubt it i don't doubt it
all that said is it a good idea to do it
yes yes trump should get maximum credit
for this
because the old situation wasn't working
and sometimes you just need to break the
old thing
and sometimes the first thing you do to
fix the thing you broke
may not be the ultimate thing but it had
to be broken
we had to try to put it back together
this looks like a good first try
if this doesn't work at least we'll
learn something
maybe we'll be smarter maybe we'll find
a way to correct it
you just got to do something sometimes
and this seems like
a very productive way to at least you
know
shake the box and see if you can get
something going all right
i have an idea to end all the window
breaking in portland
because apparently every night
there's a group of protesters protesters
who just walk down different rows of
retail businesses and break their
windows
so now it's just like a nightly thing to
break all the windows
and my my idea to end it since
apparently law enforcement is not an
option
is to hire the protesters to break
windows
are you with me yet instead of just
letting them break windows
we should hire them and pay them a good
salary to break windows
you know why this will work right
because the moment it turns into a job
they're not going to show up
i'll just leave that laying there for
you
um i saw a conversation uh
online today asking
if liberals have ruined everything you
know name name anything that
that liberals have not ruined and
the suggestion was made that at least
they haven't ruined movies
you know most liberals are making movies
to which i said have you seen movies
when was the last time you saw a good
movie
liberals have completely ruined movies
recently
i would say in the last few years movies
used to be
a lot of fun i used to like movies
i can't even remember the last time i
watched a movie that was good
they've completely ruined movies
all right um
here's here's something that happened
that can be interpreted two different
ways
there's a very positive interpretation
and then there's one that's not so
positive
and the news is that the circuit courts
have been reassigned
now i don't know all the ins and outs of
the court system
so i might not have a full understanding
of this topic but i'll try to bluff my
way through it
and we're all learning a lot about our
government in this process
so effective immediately
there are four supreme court justices
assigned to each of four states
pennsylvania wisconsin
michigan and georgia to be in charge of
the
the election fraud claims for those
states
this is my understanding of what's
happening now the fortu
for justices chosen is the story
all right so here are the supreme court
justices
who might be the deciding people or at
least
you know the most influential people on
whether these four states
go to trump or stay with biden you're
right are you ready
here are the names of the four justices
brett
kavanaugh amy coney barrett
samuel alito
and clarence thomas
do you notice anything that they have in
common
yeah they're all super
conservative so what's that tell you
well one interpretation is oh the fix is
in
trump's gonna get his way he packed the
court with conservatives
he got all conservatives to be in charge
of the most crucial question
of whether or not he's going to well i
would say that the crucial question is
whether the election stands or whether
it gets kicked
kicked to the house of representatives
so i feel as if and again i need some
fact checking on this
because i'm i'm not really i can't go
too deep on the legal system
so i could be wrong very easily just
keep that in mind
um but you know your first
your first glance at this is oh my god
trump's going to win because the
supreme court just put four conservative
justices
on the most important questions that if
they vote the right way
trump's present for a second term
what do you think of that unfortunately
i had the opposite
interpretation so
don't get too happy i probably shouldn't
have given you that one first
okay now i feel bad okay i feel bad
cat's on the roof cat's on the roof guys
because i i i need you i need you to
slowly adjust
to what you're to hear next because
otherwise it would be a little too
shocking
because if you got a little too happy
and you're doing like a little happy
dance at home
while you're watching this yes
it's over i don't think that's
necessarily
what we're watching let me give you the
other
interpretation this is my interpretation
too
so it's not just the other one it's the
one i have it goes like this
the supreme court is not just interested
in deciding cases cases matter
right it's the main bread and butter of
what they're doing
but it's not the only thing they care
about they have a greater
interest than the individual cases
and the greater interest is the republic
keeping america a functioning
country much more important than
how an individual case goes everybody
agree
if you were the supreme court and you
saw that whichever way this goes
whoever ends up in the presidency that
it would tear the country apart
do you think the supreme court supreme
court
sees what most of you see which is oh
this is
kind of a dangerous situation kind of
got a bunch of gas
and we've got a bunch of matches and it
looks like they're getting a little too
close to each other
don't you believe that the supreme court
feels
the weight of this decision
like maybe nothing else they've ever
felt
that the entire system is at risk
not just this case or cases or lawsuits
right now if you were the supreme court
and that was your greatest interest to
keep the system
intact keep the credibility of the
system
intact and you're asked to judge
something that whichever way it goes
it's going to be ugly
right what do you do
well i'll tell you what i'd do i would
assign
the four most conservative justices
if and here's the big part
if i believed trump
would ultimately lose
that's why i would assume that's why
i would put four conservative judges on
it
to make sure that if trump loses
the conservative part of the country
says
 but i trust it
see where i'm going the supreme court
needs the conservatives to back down
the only way it's going to happen is
if four super conservative
supreme court justices say
look at this people it's time
it's time it's time to back down
it's time to put biden in office and
deal with it in 2024.
i think the supreme court has just sent
the country
a big signal that trump's not
going to get a second term
and it has nothing to do with the claims
has nothing to do with the lawsuits has
nothing to do with whether the election
was
or was not fraudulent it has everything
to do
with keeping the country together if
they were thinking that way and of
course we have to speculate right we
can't read anybody's minds
but if that's what they're thinking
[Applause]
if that's what they're thinking it's
brilliant
it's brilliant if that's what
they're thinking
we don't know that but i think they are
so what is likely to happen
in my opinion um the likely the likely
outcome
is that the supreme court will give us a
decision because of the way they've set
it up with four
with four conservatives i think they're
going to give us a decision that says
yeah it looks like some stuff happened
it looks like some fraud happened
but it wasn't enough and we
we choose to keep the system together
and let you work it out in 2024
would that be the wrong decision for the
benefit
of the country
would it i don't think it would
i prefer trump to get a second term if
the country can stay together
under those conditions i prefer it
but if the republicans hold the senate
and would pretty much have a lock on the
house as well in 2022
and they can keep biden from raising my
taxes to
to sky-high levels and you know keep us
from becoming a vassal of china
i think we could wait it out and i
wouldn't mind
seeing a an ex-president trump
getting a promotion to being a media
mogul because he might even have more
power as a media mogul
than he would have even as president
it's possible
given the power of the media so i feel
as though
we can see the end game now that's what
it feels like
now the assumption is there's a really
big assumption here
the gigantic assumption is
that the supreme court believes that the
case will not be made
sufficiently to overcome the to change
the election
outcome what if it does
but what if the trump team
delivers the goods what if they do
because here's what the smartest people
are telling me doesn't mean it's true
the the people who are the smartest and
know the most and are closest to it
would tell you something like this
maybe the software was manipulated maybe
it wasn't
don't don't hang your hat on that one
but we can demonstrate that the
uh the checking of the signatures was
relaxed
the the relaxation of double checking
the signatures
almost surely change the election
outcome that might be provable
and it might be provable in a way that
any reasonable person would say oh yeah
that changed the outcome
it won't necessarily change who is in
office
it will just change your mind about who
won and that's how you get two
presidents
so i'm gonna guess right now that the
supreme court would be in quite a bind
if they put four conservative supreme
court justices on the case
and then the trump team makes the case
and if they make it i think it's going
to be on the signature verification part
that feels pretty clean clean in terms
of a case
um that could be really dangerous
because then it would look like the fix
is in right oh the supreme court
justices they're all conservative they
agreed with trump well
the fix is in could be a problem but i
don't think it would necessarily be
a fatal one all right that's all for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope is off i just want
to look at a few
comments from youtube over here
somebody says follow the law you know i
don't think that the supreme court does
that
even even conservative judges would you
somebody says you caved in scott
what does that mean what does caving in
mean
does caving in mean because what i did
was predict
is predicting caving in
um how is boo doing
boo's doing great best cat ever
um
won't be a 2024 slaughter meter update
well the slaughter meter sort of has
lost its meaning
because we have two potential outcomes
instead of just
who wins the election because i think
this two-president situation
is now real and it looks like that's
going to be persistent
meaning that people will still regard
trump as the legally elected president
even if he's out of office
somebody says it will be a guerrilla
civil war no
it won't be that you know the thing that
you can really really count on
is that nobody wants a civil war nobody
wants it
you would have to have somebody wanting
it that's the minimum requirement for a
civil war
i don't know anybody who wants it on
either side
um somebody says i do no you don't
china wants one uh i don't even know if
they do
do you think china would want the united
states to destroy itself
maybe could be
um people are too comfortable to want a
civil war that's correct
we are too comfortable somebody says you
don't think aoc
wants the gop in jail yeah i think so
i do think so but i don't think that
that's going to happen outside of the
legal system
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow as well
