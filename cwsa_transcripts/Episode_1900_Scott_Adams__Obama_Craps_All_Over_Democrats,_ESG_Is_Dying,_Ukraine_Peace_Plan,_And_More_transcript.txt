good morning everybody
it's good to see your smiling faces
uh you know you look a little bit better
than last time I saw you did you get
some sleep wow looks like you've been to
the gym
good job hydrating too if you'd like to
take it up another level get your
hydration going all you need is that
cupboard mug or a glass of tanker
chalices Dinah canteen Checker flaska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine here the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip go
ah Uzbekistan in the house
Silk Road
good to see you
all right
now would you like to hear all of the
interesting things in the news that's
why you come here right
don't you
um I have a question for you uh
anecdotally
as you know I've recently changed my
Twitter profile
to put BLM and my Pro and my pronouns
and I appear there in a BLM shirt
have you noticed this since I went to
full BLM
has the algorithm surfaced my tweets
more often
go have you seen my tweets more often in
the past week
really
I I don't really believe that we can see
that as small of a difference
but a lot of people say yes
all right so they're probably it looks
like 60 yes 40 now
if you and if I don't know if this is
true because I'm just looking at the
answers streaming by but if you thought
that was true
by let's say a 60 40 split
then I would conclude it's not true
do you understand that
if if all of you collectively gave your
opinions and about 60 percent of you
thought that I was more visible and 40
thought I was not
I would not conclude that I was more
visible because that's just about how
much bias is built into the questions
since we're all biased as hell about the
algorithm
you know if ninety percent of you had
said yes
I would have been tempted to say you
know it's just anecdotal but 90 percent
you know you can't ignore that
here's something I never hear you always
hear people say I I know science and you
don't and one thing I know is that
anecdotal information is not science
right you've heard me say that a million
times
except that
at some point there is enough anecdotal
evidence that you don't need any science
am I right
yeah and I like to use this example if
every time you walk down side
a baseball hit you in the head
and you looked around and you didn't
even see a baseball game or a baseball
field
but every day for a hundred days in a
row you walk outside you look around
you're expecting it and they go okay
boom let me hit you in the head again a
hundred times in a row and there's no
science whatsoever
to explain it
would you change your behavior after
getting hit in the head a hundred times
in a row
I think you would and I would suggest it
might be the right decision without any
science at all so there is some point at
which anecdotal evidence
is better than science
so there I said it anecdotal evidence is
better than science at some point it's
just not the onesies and twosies which
are useless
all right
so here's a typical uh type of story for
2022.
so there's these new leaked emails and I
think we knew something about this story
but maybe less detail that Hunter
Biden's real estate company
so this is Hunter Biden received 40
million investment from a Russian
oligarch yelleni yelini batarina
whose name I just like to say three
times if I may
because it's such a fun name to say I'm
just going to gratuitously say it two
more times
Yelina batarina
one more this is just for me this is
just for me please bear with me
yalida batarina I just have to get that
out of my system
all right she's a billionaire Widow of a
corrupt Moscow mayor so what could go
wrong there and not only did she invest
40 million into the Biden real estate
company but gave 3.5 million to Hunter
Biden for Consulting
now does anybody really think that that
was a consulting fee 3.5 million
oh obviously that was a gigolo fee
she was paying him for sex
3.5 million might seem like a lot but I
checked her picture
and I'd say that was market rate
it looked like a market rate to me
all right
um
and let me tell you what the FBI is
doing about this given that there's
voluminous
evidence of uh possible Hunter Biden
impropriety I've got that information
what the FBI is doing
huh I can't find it let's see what what
is the FBI doing
might be in here
no anything anything is this odd
no oh the FBI is doing nothing nothing
as usual
uh
I I this is why I feel like there's some
kind of pendulum turning
this next bit I don't even understand
so this was tweeted by a Democrat
activist Scott dworkin
and if you look at his profile he's he's
big and Democrat stuff she's like a real
Democrat super Democrat activist guy so
a Democrat activist was tweeting around
a hidden camera recording of a
Republican representative Dave schweiker
who's in an elevator talking to somebody
and he got recorded
and he was caught on this undercarver
video
and and he talked about break if the GOP
wins
in the elections they take control he
was talking about the GOP would want to
break up the FBI and impeach members of
the Biden Administration
and a Democrat operative
thought I gotcha I got you now
boy they're never they're never going to
vote for you now that you're willing to
break up the FBI
and put in jail
uh some members of the administration
not in jail I'm talking about
impeachment
now am I wrong that the Democrat
misjudged
the reaction to that
because I looked at it I said oh yeah
that's that's exactly why Republicans
are going to vote for republicans
because they want exactly that
am I missing something does this story
sound like bad news to Democrats if
you're a Democrat you say oh no they're
going to break up the FBI
what Democrat thinks that
are they afraid that the FBI will be
modernized or
what and how about impeaching members of
the Biden Administration
well don't you think that even Democrats
think there's going to have to be
something there or
or there will be no impeachment remember
the Democrats think that the Trump
impeachment was valid
so they actually think impeachment's
like a real thing where real evidence
comes out and a real decision is made
so if they think that impeachment is a
real thing
they wouldn't be shouldn't be too
worried about somebody trying it unless
somebody's guilty of something otherwise
it'd just be
an embarrassing situation like January
6.
well the George Floyd family is
considering a lawsuit against yay
uh because yay said in public
that he believes that George Floyd more
likely died of a fentanyl overdose than
from the actions of the police
now
I read this story and I just started
salivating do you know why
please please do the lawsuit
please do
because I don't think they thought this
through
think it through
if they do the lawsuit
Kanye gets to re-litigate the question
of the Fentanyl and George Floyd system
and I don't know how this works
but if enough time has gone by
and it's you know Kanye or yay who's he
was part of it they're going to have to
do discovery
they're gonna they're gonna litigate
just that part of it again
so just the one question was it the
fentanyl or the knee imagine that being
a new case
and what if
what if the reason the George Floyd
trial went the way it did
just if
was because the citizens and you know
the jury and the judge and basically
everybody evolved knew if they didn't
get a conviction the whole city would go
up in flames
right
so I do not think that Derek Chauvin got
a fair trial
or anything like it it has nothing to do
with being white right if you reverse
reverse the races I would say the same
thing yeah it doesn't matter who who was
the person or what was the situation
if one if one verdict would have a riot
and the other verdict would not if one
verdict could get you killed literally
killed as a jury
and the other verdict would get you
praised
what are you gonna do right but what if
Cartier ends up in this trial he
wouldn't ask for it but what if he ends
up in one
and he gets to try it in an unbiased
place after time has gone by in the
George Floyd
you know anger is subsided a little bit
what if he wins
what if he wins see the George Floyd
family is probably under the assumption
that they would certainly win or at
least they would certainly win on the
facts the facts big has been proven blah
blah but correct me if I'm wrong didn't
the year didn't the original
um autopsy weren't there some notes
where the original autopsy doctor said
under normal circumstances if they came
to your house and found you dead
with that much fentanyl in you they
would say that was a fentanyl overdose
but because of the others you know the
other situation around it they decided
it wasn't
you know all Kanye all year has to do
is show that note and then just keep
showing it and here it is again and here
is again because if the coroner or
whoever did the autopsy I guess is
quarter
if the corridor also has some doubt
at one time
isn't that sort of enough
to show that a citizen could have doubt
as well
I mean I think I think yay gets away
with it just by showing there's some
question
about whether the experts got it right
right you would have to know the experts
got it right in order to know the con
the yay you got it wrong
I don't know that would be an
interesting trial that could change
everything
it could change everything except it
would take you know a year and be a huge
waste of time
all right
um
I think it was a Wall Street Journal
noted that uh Black Americans
um are they're less like other voters in
the sense that most voters are looking
at economic stuff as the top issue
black voters also say economic stuff is
the top issue
but according to the racist and bigoted
Wall Street Journal I'll explain that
later
um
they say that black voters are not just
obsessed on the economics like other
voters but also have equal weight to
things like Health Care education and
Public Safety
all right here's what's wrong with that
do you see the racist part of that
did anybody see that this story is
totally racist
let me say it again and see if you see
it
right so the Wall Street Journal says
that most voters
I'm paraphrasing here it says that most
most voters are think the economy is the
number one thing
but black voters sort of spread their
interest you know they also think the
economy is a big thing but they also
think that Health Care education and
Public Safety which are characterized as
social things
in the article those are social things
and not not economics
do you see the problem is it just me
these are all economics
it's just a bunch of economics
here's the other way to say this story
here's the non-racist way to say the
story okay you ready for this the this
this will this might blow your mind a
little bit here's the non-racist way to
say the same story
black voters seem to be more tuned into
the fact that their economic well-being
is associated with Healthcare education
and Public Safety because you can't run
a business if you don't have a safety
you can't hire people you can't you
can't Thrive you can't improve your your
economic situation without education and
Health Care is simply something that you
buy when you have a good job usually is
something you buy with economics right
so you tell me I'm wrong tell me I'm
wrong isn't this a fully racist story
am I right
if if you were a little bit objective
you would say the black population has a
better being on this issue they have a
better bead on the issue they understand
it better
now it might be also true that at a
certain economic
strata
that this all looks like economics to
you but if you're up in your Ivory Tower
you say oh economics is the stock market
and do I have a job and down here is
these social issues it's not a
social issue if I have to pay for it
am I am I done that's my whole argument
if I have to pay for it like Health Care
it's not a social argument
it's not a social argument
I'm paying for it that's economics
anyway
I uh
but I'm right right this is a totally
racist story
am I right
see this is why I have the black lives
matter profile because you need me to
suss out this this these examples of
systemic racism that are everywhere
all right
um
uh this next section will be called the
why are they not already in jail
now I'll bet you can't even guess what
the topic is
but the category is why aren't they
already in jail
here's the story
uh researchers I can't even believe this
is true like I can't believe this is
true researchers at Boston University
say they have developed a new coveted
strain that has 80 percent kill rate
not 80 percent more
not eighty percent more
it kills eighty percent of the people
who get it based on mice now they've
only used it on mice
but they're you know they're assuming it
would be the same with people
so what they did was they took the
original Alpha variant that's deadly
and they then they took some I don't
know Spike protein or something from the
Omicron
and they took the the worst parts of the
two viruses and they put them together
to make a super deadly virus
to which I say
and the researchers are still alive
why haven't they been killed already
why are they still alive
 shouldn't the homeland security
shut down the whole place
and literally imprisoned forever anybody
involved in this research do you know
why I say imprison them or kill them
because they know how to do this I don't
want them telling anybody else how to do
this
don't you think somebody would pay them
a lot of money to explain how to do it
so they can do it some terrorist or
something
yeah now I'm not really I'm not
literally
advocating that the law be violated and
their constitutional rights be taken
away but it's it's funny to ask why are
they not already in jail
this was reported like it's a story of
Interest
this is not a story of Interest this is
some who built a weapon of mass
destruction to depopulate the
planet Earth and we're reporting it like
it's a normal story
well a little story
no they should all be in jail
am I wrong
why are they not in jail they built a
weapon of mass destruction that would
destroy the Earth
if it works
yeah just doing their job
yeah no in reality of course there's I
don't think there's any law that they've
broken so of course they should not go
to jail but in terms of Common Sense
they need to be removed from the public
somehow
I know there's probably no legal ethical
way to do it but I don't want these
people walking around
where anybody could like grab them and
say show us your notes how did you do
this we want to make ourselves a super
virus ourselves
anyway
that's a sign of the times
how many of you have caught the
inflation reduction lie it goes like
this Joe Biden says well sure
inflation's bad but the inflation
reduction bill
will lower the cost of a number of
things we haven't seen it yet because it
takes a little while for the the bill to
work through the system but once it's
worked through the system things such as
let's say anything that uses energy
would be uh lower price so you get it
you'd be able to lower your ongoing
Energy prices by buying
products and utilities that use less
energy
and also hearing aids over the counter
that was another
that was another example so hearing aids
might be cheaper Medicare might reduce
your costs if they negotiate better and
some products could be less
all right so those are three examples
where they would have lowered the price
the end price for the consumer so that
lowers inflation right
is that let's take for example that
those are true things
let's say it's true that these prices
would go down let's say everything else
stayed the same
and Medicare hearing aids and any
products that use electricity they all
go down in price
would you call that a reduction in
inflation go
if it's true if it's true just take that
as an assumption is that a reduction in
inflation
no it's an increase in inflation
is literally an increase
let me say it again those of you who
don't haven't studied economics they're
playing a game with you because
journalists don't understand economics
and that's it now I don't know why the
real journalists who do understand the
economics haven't called them out on
this because I haven't heard it yet have
you
let me explain how inflation works
inflation doesn't mean one of your
products went down in cost or went up in
cost
it's about you know the value of money
in general
so what the government has proposed with
their inflation reduction Act is that
the government will increase its debt
and then that money that they got by
increasing the debt will be spent to
subsidize your ex your purchases of
let's say medic you know everything from
Medicare related things to hearing aids
and products
if the government borrows your money
because it's basically our money if the
government borrows on our behalf to
lower our prices did they lower or
increase our inflation go
if they if they do exactly what they
said
they borrow money
they subsidize products that you buy
have they lowered or increased inflation
they've increased now
correct me if I'm wrong
this is unambiguous
once I've explained it to you right if I
had to explain that well let me ask this
question first here's the first question
until I explained it to you that this is
literally mathematically
specifically and in every way the
opposite of inflation reduction
before I have done that did you know
that how many of you knew that
now some of you are going to say we knew
it wouldn't be a good idea that's
different
that's not what I'm saying I'm saying
that it's literally the opposite of what
they're selling
so a lot of you knew it okay have you
seen anybody say that the way I said it
has anybody said it the way I said it on
the news
because did I not just explain it better
than you've heard it
I think so I think I explained it better
than you've heard it anywhere
so see if you see my version of the
explanation
filter its way into the uh the media
because here here's a classic example
where the general media is not
economically trained
do you do you think that the talking
heads on I'll just pick CNN or MSNBC do
you think the talking heads on MSNBC
understand well I just said
that this specifically increases
inflation to lower some of your costs in
the short term
do they understand that I don't think so
I think they say prices go up or prices
go down and they think that's all
inflation and it's not those are two
different things
all right uh so here's the Biden
dementia update
um
he was out in public and was it the
I think it was captive who said
yesterday in Garfield
exclamation
uh that every time Biden talks something
bad happens
every time he every time he talks
something bad happens
now I'm sure somebody said that about
Trump at one point but not like this
like when Trump talks it's provocative
and he causes trouble and you know
everybody's head blows up but every time
that Biden talks he looks worse
am I right
here's the newest one somebody mentioned
he was in the LA area and somebody
mentioned that gas is seven dollars a
gallon and Biden told the reporter that
gas has always been seven dollars a guy
I live in California
now that's not what he meant right in
context
in context he did not mean that can we
be non-political for a moment
in context what he meant was California
always has higher gas prices would you
agree
that that wasn't actually
that wasn't dementia he knew that
California always has higher gas prices
but the way he said it was just so
incompetent right you have the right
idea about the way he said it was just
so dementia anyway
uh
and he said
what else do you say this eventually was
and said uh
you said he said Nationwide gas prices
came down about a dollar 35.
okay I don't know if that's true maybe
it did uh they're they're still down
over a dollar
wait if they went down a dollar 35 and
they're still down over a dollar
isn't that the long way to say they're
going back up
he just said they're going back up but
he made it sound like they're going down
that was pretty good okay I'll give him
credit for that
um
and then he said housing is the big
comma is the most important thing we
have to do in terms of that
in terms of what getting prices down
do any of you think that housing is the
big thing we have to do like where is
housing on the list of top 10 priorities
of the country
is zero isn't it
correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's
I mean I suppose that would just be
considered economics as well
going back to my prior arguments
all right Obama was on a podcast and he
calls the Democrats uh woke Buzz scale
people
um and
uh here's the problem
is if I don't blow my nose I'm not going
to be able to go on much further
so excuse me
oh
excuse me
you know that's one of the advantages of
having a low budget show
nothing embarrasses me
[Music]
all right we're back
all right so Obama by Framing the
Democrats problems as being too woke
did anybody see that so Obama actually
went right at the Democrat primary
messaging and the primary messaging is
hey all you bad Republicans
and Obama approved once again
why he was elected president twice
every time I hear Obama talk and you I
know you don't like his policies or
whatever so we're not talking about that
just talk about his ability
as a politician every time he talks he
sounds smart to me
even when I don't like you know the
policy or whatever but whenever he talks
he sounds smart right
and he did a better job than all of the
Democrats
of
putting wokeness in context and
basically he said you have to let people
you know be people and don't worry so
much about using the right terms and
stuff like that so basically Obama
triangulated and came up with a way that
Republicans and Democrats could live in
the same planet
Obama did that right now
I would say Trump did not
and Biden did not
was it really that hard to find that
middle space
it seems like the middle is just begging
to be occupied and the middle is yeah we
should be nice to each other
you know and maybe respect how they want
to identify but don't get all bent out
of shape if somebody gets it wrong
wasn't that always the middle
it means where I've been I've described
the middle exactly like that in fact
Obama's position is exactly mine
let me state it again
I'm happy to call anybody by whatever
terms they think are respectful
in return I asked for what Obama asks
don't be a buzz skill if I use the wrong
word it's not personal
just just get over it that's all so I'm
100 on the Obama opinion there but
here's the political ramification
because Obama has put this frame on it
and he's he's framed the Republicans as
worried as too concerned about the wrong
things
and he says that pretty directly I'm
paraphrasing but he does say pretty
directly that they're they're focusing
on the wrong things instead of the
things that affect people
and because he framed it so prominently
should the red tide happen and
Republicans sweep Congress
that's going to make Obama's frame the
dominant frame
so think ahead
think ahead to Republicans win Congress
what will everybody say after the fact
they're going to look at Obama's Framing
and they're going to say damn it we
should have listened to him
he got this right we were focusing too
much on the wokeness and we didn't get
the basics right and the Republicans did
so they won
now whether or not Obama is correct that
you know this wokeness thing is a
problem or not independent of that I
think he is correct by independent of
whether he's right or not
is it true that he's created the
dominant frame
would you say you may say too early to
tell but if the Republicans win this is
going to come back isn't it you're going
to see it again
respectfully you fall for every leftist
manipulation
You Think I'm Falling for a manipulation
you haven't even heard my point yet let
me finish my point
the point is that Obama has created a
frame that the Democrats are likely to
fall into naturally
and this should be the uh the next big
blow against the wokeness monsters and I
think Obama will be the the Assassin
I think Obama has created a situation
where when the Democrats fall into the
trapeze created of losing
he say well I told you why you were
going to lose you can see it everywhere
and you walk right into it even though I
gave you plenty of warning
and I think it's going to make the whole
ESG d i
CRT wokeness World a little bit
less important
that's what I think
speaking of ESG I've got more ESG
related Comics running this week
and I haven't heard if I've been
canceled yet today
but they're getting a little bit more
pointed and I know you would like to
know what that comic said today
so let me give you an update
uh stop it
I will get that in a moment and
all right so Dilbert's um
Dilbert's boss is talking to Tina
and the boss says Tina there's an
opening for director of AI and you are
one of the people I'm considering and
Tina Tina is a technical writer so she's
not a technical doesn't have a technical
job except for the writing part and she
says I have no qualifications for that
job and the boss says that's okay the AI
will tell you what to do
and then the third panel Tina says are
you only offering me the job to meet
your ESG and Dei goals and the boss says
I'm not allowed to say
and that was been pretty popular
so at the same time that Dilbert is
attacking ESG Obama is attacking
welkness
and
um
Texas and black rock are going at each
other because apparently Texas is trying
to get rid of all this wokeness stuff
and now BlackRock and of course
BlackRock is the primary purveyor of the
the wokeness in investment so they're
the ones pushing it on corporations to
be extra
environmentally socially in governance
wise you know Equitable and fair and
good and awoke
and
um
oh well
it's interesting I thought I copied and
pasted something and then there's a cool
technology that copied and pasted the
thing that says don't copy and paste
I've never seen that before
I didn't even notice it until now
anyway so um
yeah so so you've got Texas going after
BlackRock for being anti-energy that's
her complaint so BlackRock thinks that
um you know your ESG score would be
lower the E being environmental if
you're involved in the petroleum gas
kind of business
and since that's a big part of the Texas
economy they're not too happy about
BlackRock and now blackrock's pushing
back all right so
as of today
the forces moving against wokeness are
as follows
the midterm election which probably is
going to go One Direction
Obama which is said now clearly that the
wokeness is a problem
yay he's got his own problems with the
Jewish Community which may overshadow
anything else but you know he's he's
sort of the anti-wokness person
you've got uh Dilbert a always a
Bellwether of you know cultural change
that's on ESG and now you've
got the state of Texas crapping on it
so do you feel the pendulum
has reached
its height
it's getting ready to start
do you feel it yet
well it's coming
um
so China decided to delay indefinitely
the release of its uh GDP and other
economic statistics
so let me let me do some mind reading
why would a country delay indefinitely
their economic data
is it because it's so good
they don't they're humble and they don't
want to embarrass themselves with these
great great numbers is it because
they're right in the range that people
sort of expected which is not so good
but that's not a not not unexpected
coming out of a pandemic or is it
possibly
that they're numbers are terrible
so big problems in China you know
they've got a their Workforce is
shrinking and
um
the people are bringing their
manufacturing back
and they got a lot of debt and they're
still doing the coveted lockdowns and
they've got a dictator who's installed
himself for a life
so China is on the decline
erasmussen had some uh information about
uh California and abortion so
California's got this
proposition one on the ballot that would
I guess it would codify and make
abortion legal under most circumstances
and 59 of Californians supported
but in August
66 supported it
so there was this really solid
two-thirds supported you know abortion
as proposition one ex would would
protect
um two-thirds but it's already down to
59 percent
it's not very just a few months I wonder
if that's
the actual change or maybe a polling
thing I don't know but that's like a big
change for a few months
kind of surprised
all right but anyway it looks like
California is going to stay a place you
can go and get your abortion so
apparently it'll be legal to come to
California as a tourist get your
abortion and leave
let's let's talk about Ukraine
I keep looking for
evidence that you that Ukraine or Russia
or
winning territory of the ground have you
noticed that all stopped
the the only reference that I could find
to Ukraine gaining ground is CNN made
one well one sentence reference
to uh the Russians losing ground
with no detail
it's not like they lost ground around
this town or the Earth Circle or
anything like that there's just no
detail
the only detail about the military is
the Iranian drone rockets that the
Russians are using bombing the centers
and the guided Munitions that are taking
out the infrastructure
for I guess Russia has already taken
over 30 of the power plants in Ukraine
30 percent
now
there is some thinking
that the Russians might be low on
Munitions because they're using low-end
stuff already so they're using the
Iranian crappy little bombs
that are good for Terror but they're not
really
you know they're not as decisive as the
big stuff
why do I think the drones are Iranians
because they've been captured on the
ground and they've been identified as
Iranian
so our military says that's a fact it's
not they're not wondering they say you
know it's it's overwhelming evidence
they're rating now the Iranians say no
the Iranians say it's not theirs but you
know we don't trust them so
here's the thing have they reached the
stalemate
I would say that they are not desperate
yet
so there's no there isn't going to be a
peace deal this week
because this week they still think they
can get a little advantage
so what happens in the winter
well if it's true that Russia is running
out of munitions
we should really really see that in the
winter right
unless they have some other source that
we don't know about
so in the winter we should see the
ukrainians starving
uh well maybe more freezing than
startling although I think they'll
mostly survive
because I think they'll
go where there is even the bird trees
and they'll do what they have to do
uh allergies are just terrible today
sorry
now that assumes that Russians don't
continue bombing successfully power
plants
because if Russia got took out 70
percent
wouldn't you imagine that the ukrainians
would be in a lot of trouble 30 they
could probably struggle by
in all likelihood
the most desperate time will be
somewhere around
January February
no probably January because February
would still seem like you're getting
close to the the turn of the weather I
say January
somewhere around January
when the Russians are running out of
ammo and their people are freezing and
their their army is
uh
deserting
and the ukrainians are suffering
Maybe
people will start talking about peace
now here's what you can do as Citizens
do you believe that your government is
capable of making helping peace happen
in Ukraine I say no
I believe our government is trying to
end Putin what do you think I believe
that the Biden Administration is trying
to get rid of Putin and permanently
degrade Russia
that's what it looks like
so as far as I can tell there is no
um
there's no interest in the United States
forming a deal
so if we want that to happen
we the Citizens We're going to have to
do it now I'm going to make a statement
about America
and you historians tell me if I'm right
or wrong all right historians ready
our government as good as starting Wars
go true or false our government is good
at getting us into war right
true everybody agrees
question two or statement two
our government is bad at getting us out
of wars
they're bad at ending War true yes even
more true
but what about the public
the public doesn't really get you into
war they're usually the ones who are
dragged along but it's the public who
gets you out of War
it's the public who gets you out of War
it's ended the Vietnam War probably Iraq
probably Afghanistan
and now this
if the public of the United States
doesn't take charge of this situation
then you'll get the government's you
know unfettered strategy
which will get you pretty close to
nuclear war because if they're looking
to end the Putin which is what it looks
like
then you don't know what's going to
happen
I don't think you're in danger I don't
think there will be a nuclear launch
I think you know the odds are really
really small
but it's a risk and since it's such a
big risk even a small chance of that you
have to treat seriously
so
here's what I think's going to happen
I think that both sides have cleverly
said there's no negotiating so I think
Putin says he wants to control all of
Ukraine now whereas zelenski says that
he wants they want to get Crimea back
which they lost in 2014 and is is
solidly in Russian hands which seems
unlikely
um but here's the good news you ready
for the good news
zelenski is really really talented at
persuasion would you all agree
that no matter what else you think of
him he's really really good at
persuasion
everything that he's done suggests his
he got the United States to back up he
got incredible you know weapons you know
he's being treated like a hero now I
don't think
that the the hero
label fits him like I I've my I'm not
I'm not 100 on the zelinski bandwagon
right we're sort of tentatively on his
side
but I think I'd watch him really
carefully right I'd watch my wallet when
zelinski's around
so I don't trust him
but he's very talented
and here's what he's done that you don't
realize
you know how I always I used to talk
about Trump as creating assets out of
nothing
he would he would simply persuade
something into existence and then he
would use it to trade it away
you crave something out of nothing and
then you sell it to you know or trade it
in a deal was zelenski's done with
Crimea
is he's taken something that most
observers say is completely
non-negotiable Russia just has it and
they would launch a nuclear weapon to
keep it
but zalenci said is non-negotiable that
he's getting it back
that is smart
that's why zielinski is zelenski
because if if it were you you might be
saying the wrong thing which is well
they've already got Crimea but we really
care about this new stuff they took you
know let's just stop the new stuff
Crimea is too too much of an ask because
Russia needs that for strategic reasons
they're going to fight for it harder
than they would from the other stuff and
bazelenski
by Framing Crimea from the start as
non-negotiable has created an asset he
can trade
right
because it looks like there's no way you
could get a deal
zielinski wants you to believe that
zelenski wants everyone to believe
especially Russia that No Deal can be
made
because that
if it came down to look look we will
start the fighting the only thing we ask
is don't join NATO
and and don't take Crimea back that's
all we ask we'll give you back these
other disputed territories
and then zielinski has something to
trade
something that doesn't exist
his control of Crimea he would trade it
away
it's very smart
now is Putin also smart yes Putin is
saying the only thing I want is control
of all of Ukraine basically he says
Ukraine can't be an independent country
do you think he means it
no no no he's doing what zelinski's
doing
he's creating an asset out of nothing
now of course you do believe you do
believe that Putin does want all of
Ukraine because he does
you know if it were free of course but
he knows he can't have it now
so since he knows he can't have all of
Ukraine he's saying I'll trade you all
over your grave effectively he's setting
it up for that
so you can see the end game already the
end game is that
Putin will release on all of Ukraine
which he doesn't have
zelenski will release on Crimea which he
doesn't have
so they'll both trade something that
doesn't exist and that will be the
primary part of the deal
the thing they don't have and can't get
and then they'll make some accommodation
about the future of NATO and do
something with those little areas
that might be temporary it might be
permanent I don't know but it's doable
so if you believe that there there's no
doable peace plan you're completely
wrong all of the elements are in place
the only thing that we're missing
what's the one element we're missing
insufficient quantity what are we
missing in sufficient quantity
and we're almost there
sanity yeah desire drones no no
but it's obvious
this is not a hard question but you're
not getting there we go paid paid right
we're not at the pain threshold that
would require a peace plan
so Ukraine probably still thinks they
have a chance of military getting
militarily getting some land back maybe
uh Russia might think well if we can
drag this out through the winter we'll
ruin their resolve maybe but that means
that neither side has reached the the
pain Point yet so there's no deal to be
made
that's the most important thing
somewhere around January I predict their
their Mutual pain will reach a level
where a peace deal makes sense
and also you know Russia might be
running out of Munitions and the the
both both sides will be in a lot of
trouble
by January and that's when you do the
deal
because you can't do it till then they
all know that things will be worth worse
in January so they're going to wait for
that
you'll see see if the other side gets it
worse than they do
all right
um
and I've uh I've been promoting uh David
sacks
tweeted uh planned he also wrote an
article in Newsweek which his deal which
I'll say again would be that Russia
would give back the the new territory
that they just captured since February
they will keep Crimea because that's
they have a navy base and it's just too
important for them and
Ukraine would not join NATO
does that sound like a deal that could
be made in January
I'd say yes
I think yes
now I'm not predicting it will be
I'm saying that that's the only time it
could be
and that it's a doable deal
now it's not the deal I would have done
I would have expanded the deal to
include you know space and other things
so it looks like a I I would make it
look like it's not a peace deal for
Ukraine and Russia
because as soon as you do that it looks
like you've got a winner and a loser but
you could erase that by expanding the
deal to other domains and then say okay
we found a way for everybody to win
because we got all these other things
that are in there and those are good
so if you want something that would last
do something that makes everybody look
like they want that's doable
um
and oh the other thing that zielinski
did this brilliant persuasion wise so
you know the chechens
um
looked like they wanted to send them you
know 70 000 highly trained vicious
soldiers to help Putin because they had
the Chechen Republic is a pro-putin guy
so he's he's really really trying to
show his Pro Putin stuff but as you know
the Chester Republic was brutally
crushed by Putin some years ago so you
don't think the chechins are necessarily
Pro Putin except for their leader
so here's what zielinski did
the Ukrainian Parliament has recognized
the Cheshire Republic of ichkeria as an
independent state
that is quote temporarily occupied by
Russia
they condemned the Russian genocide
against the cheshan people
persuasion
sitting sitting ovation
all right
oh so good
so good that's like an A plus right
there well I don't think it'll change
anything
but uh just in terms of the the mental
game
a plus
right so zelenski is going for the kill
shot
zelenski's not trying to survive anymore
he's trying to take putinail and if he
can cause a Revolution in Russia I don't
think this will do it but
but he's he's pushing all the the
sensitive stuff
now let me ask you this
how much how many bombs can Kev accept
before they bomb Moscow
do you think that's coming
because I can't decide if that's a
propaganda mistake
probably would be a mistake when it
would feel like too much of an
escalation
but zaleski seems willing to escalate so
I don't know
I think it would just make the public
angry and make them dig in I think the
Russian bombing of Kiev is a mistake
to me that looks like a military mistake
what do you think
because I don't see that it's going to
change the resolve
you know the number of people who died
in Kev from the rocket attacks
give me a fact check of this but
from the Iranian drones yesterday five
five civilians time
out of the whole city of Kiev five
people died
if only five people die in the city
in a day
that's not really I don't know I don't
see that changing the course of the war
seven people somebody said yeah I mean
every day every death is a tragedy we
know that but in terms of predicting
where it goes that's a small number
yeah
supposedly 6 000 total civilian deaths
since the start that doesn't sound like
many you know the the Iranian drone
attacks are about as close to an EMP as
you can get
because there's almost virtually no
human death
but it's you know getting rid of
infrastructure and stuff
anyway
um
so I think the public is going to have
to take control of the peace
negotiations because our government
doesn't seem willing or capable of doing
it I think promoting the David sacks
plan
if only because it tells Putin that
there are peace paths so the the odds of
using a nuclear weapon if you think
there's a chance of a peace deal
there's no way Putin's going to use a
nuke you agree with that right if he
thinks there's a legitimate pretty good
chance for a peace deal you would never
actually use a nuke
and I think if the public with you know
Elon Musk and David Saxon people who are
prominent if if they're willing to talk
about the details of a deal
it tells Putin to hold off of the nukes
so you are actually part of the war
process now whether you like it or not
so the American public opinion which is
we're starting to form here
is one of the things that will keep you
safe
so if it's your opinion that Putin
doesn't need to be removed
and and there is a peace plan
he is far less likely to use a nuke
because he would go for the safer
possibilities first
yeah no and I don't think anybody uses a
nuke in their own country
I I just don't
and remember Russia's whole argument is
that Ukraine needs to be part of Russia
right so if he nukes even the
battlefield of Russia
I just don't see it I just don't see it
because remember you know when we look
at Ukraine we're just seeing real estate
but the entire idea here is that you
created Russia have some kind of a you
know a soul connection or you know
there's some kind of deeper connection I
don't know what the analogy would be in
the United States but it would be like
you know let's say there were some Civil
War
and we talked about you know nuking
Washington DC
I feel like we wouldn't do it even if
militarily we thought it made sense
because you can't really nuke your own
country
it's just hard
uh
uh if he nukes Ukraine he loses his
claim as a sovereign of Ukraine
exactly
yeah I think the Tactical nukes would be
the same problem
you know just the pr of it is bad all
right that's all for today YouTube I'll
talk to you tomorrow
