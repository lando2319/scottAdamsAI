bow
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a better time in your life or
anybody's life it's so good well you can
hardly believe it but if you'd like to
take it up to levels that nobody could
ever dream are possible all you need is
a cup of mug or a glass attacker a
tanker jealous of Stein a canteen Joker
flask of vessel Liberty kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopa being hit of the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now
ah
delightful
I love all of you a little bit better
I like you one sip of coffee better
that's my unit of pleasure
well uh how did you like that event last
night though it was a three copper
that was a three copper that's maximum
enjoyment
all right well uh yesterday I had this
experience
a gentleman who's doing some work at my
house comes in and he says uh
did you know that there's blood
spattered on the front of your garage
and I said exactly what one says when
somebody says that what's the next thing
you say when somebody says did you know
there's blood spattered on your garage
the next thing you say is
what
there's literally nothing else you could
say you the next thing that comes out of
your mouth is
so I go outside and actually since
yesterday so we know what happened
happened last what happened over the
weekend maybe
but uh there's there's actually red
spots that looks like blood
from the top of the front of the garage
which is probably 20 feet above the
ground
and then you know just like spots down
the front and then on a Ledge
what do you think that was
yeah big story didn't happen you want me
to take you outside right now
I I can drag your ass right outside to
show it to you
if you don't believe me
but you know what I haven't done yet I
haven't looked on the roof to see if
there's anything dead up there
I I can see the roof from this window I
just haven't looked out yet if I go up
these little stairs and look at a window
I can see if there is anything dead on
my roof should I do it
I would but I've got two devices I can't
carry them all right
here's my here's my guess of what it is
you want to hear my guess
now the first thing you should know is
that the reason we had been looking at
that wall in the first place
is because I got hanked
somebody drove by and threw eggs at my
house
yes that happened that's right and I
don't know if you know this but the eggs
actually destroy the paint
you have to repaint your house
yeah I have to repaint my house
because somebody ached it there's no
other way to fix it you can't clean it
off
so
um
I have better security cameras now so
here's what I think happened I don't
think it was a prank or a human I don't
think there was a human involvement
here's my best guess see if this sounds
right to you remember the splatter is
from the top to the bottom and it's not
very dense you know it's maybe maybe 10
splotches you know just dime-sized
splotches up the wall here's what I
think it is I think there was a hawk
because where I live there's a bunch of
hawks it's actually named after the
Hawks where I live so uh the Hawks are
always an action I think they add some
prey
and it was bleeding out as They carried
it over the house
and that it was you know sort of
bleeding and these splotches just hit
the house as the hawk flew over what do
you think
because nothing else makes sense if it
had been a human uh human done prank it
would have been bigger
but small splotches 20 feet up the roof
I'm thinking a hawk with prey
so that's my uh that's my analysis
all right would you like to hear the
best story ever
I tell I know I always tell you it's
going to be the best story ever but do I
deliver every time
every time it's a new high I'm going to
read you this from the New York Post and
I like the way it's written
so I'm just going to read it to you just
the way it's written
New York Post at least four women were
involved in a wild caught on camera
brawl near a set of poker tables at
luxury Las Vegas hotel over the weekend
one woman was even pulled from a
motorized scooter inside the Encore at
Wynn Las Vegas as a security guard in a
bystander tried to break up the massive
fight Sunday evening
the video starts rolling mid-fight with
two women one in jean shorts and the
other in a two-piece dress with her
thong exposed struggling on the floor as
they duke it out a man with a Nike
t-shirt rushes in to prevent a woman
dressed in cream sweatpants from joining
the fracas as he attempts to break up
the scrum on the floor of the fancy
hotel
but as he turns his attention to the two
brawling women the women the woman in
sweats lunges for another woman standing
nearby and appears to throw a Haymaker
hahaha
well it goes on
it goes on I'm just saying oh no I sold
my stock in Wind just before it went way
up
the worst investment decision I ever
made I held wind hotels through the
pandemic because I thought well surely
this is going to come raging back after
the pandemic
and then I sold it because I just got
tired of waiting and I thought I had too
much Shiner risk and I sold it I just
went to the moon right after I think it
doubled right after I sold it
so uh no I'm not making any money on the
Wynn Hotel
but I just
I just like this reporting it was the
least important thing that happened
today
the least important thing
but it was written very funny so I liked
it
so here's some news that could easily be
the biggest news in the world it might
not be
but the next story could be is within
the realm of possibility it's the
biggest story in Civilization
right that there's a startup I guess you
called the startup yeah it is a startup
called uh aklo or oklo oklo it's a
nuclear
energy startup making small modular
nuclear power plants now they haven't
made one I think they're getting closer
but they're going I don't know they're
going public through a spec or something
like that that was the news but the
thing you need to know is that Sam
Altman is one of the big or maybe the
biggest investor in this
so Sam Altman of AI of fusion
Investments he does some big stuff
if you if Sam Altman is not already a
household name
it's got to be
I mean if you don't know who he is you
better start paying attention because he
started he started maybe I'm just
guessing he probably started 10 years
ago
to invest in companies that you wouldn't
hear of for 10 years but when you did
holy hell and one of them is open AI
chat GPT same guy
well when he's not making AI to change
the world he's also investing in nuclear
power startup
now here's the big thing
here's what he says about
um he says nuclear energy industry can
make electricity that is quote a way
better deal than anything else out there
now if somebody else said that
nuclear power is more economical than
everything out there you might say to
yourself oh there's just a
you know an advocate or you know
somebody who's in the tank for it or
something like that but when Sam Altman
says it's a way better deal than
anything else out there
here's the thing you can trust
he looked into it
okay do you this that's the thing you
have to know it's Sam Altman
if Sam Altman so this would be similar
to an Elon Musk telling you something is
true
economically or or technologically right
if Elon Musk says the following
statement is a true statement about
technology
don't we believe it
right but you just say okay that's
probably true
you should do the same with Sam open
right if he says he looked into it and
it's by far the best economics it is
it is
he looked into it and he's smart right
so I would love
to see of course I'd love to see a
conversation between Sam Altman and RFK
Jr not a debate not a debate
I would like to see them have a
conversation
because I would like to say I'm Altman
to explain why he thinks his startup
will be the most economical energy that
could be produced short of fusion you
know Fusion is also one of his
Investments that's down the line but at
the moment
it looks like they could build these
things and they would be the best
economics in the energy world
don't you want to see RFK Jr sit with
them and say all right my current
opinion is that nuclear energy cannot be
made economically
but you've got to start up
that looks like maybe it could
tell me what you're doing different
don't you want to see that I'd rather
see that than a campaign event
wouldn't you
like actually to find out
can I convince RFK Jr or can Sam Allman
convince RFK Jr that this startup should
it shouldn't work you know all startups
are a bat
but I'm pretty sure he's going to pull
this off right it's all the right people
I'm sure
um all right
today the Dilbert reborn comic which you
can only see if you're on locals or
subscribing to it on Twitter
um decided to uh
take a run at ESG and Larry Fink who's
the CEO of BlackRock
and the biggest promoter of ESG equity
uh Equity uh
says what's the second thing and
governance
sustainability in governance right
so here's dog Birch running into Larry
Fink who's walking down the street
and dogbert calls out to him and he says
hey are you the biggest racist in the
world
and gentleman turns around he says I'm
Larry Fink the CEO of BlackRock and I'm
the and I'm best known as the champion
of ESG and Corporate America
and dogberg says I'll take that as a yes
and then Larry Fink says you're totally
ignoring my good intentions
well I thought it was time to put the
put the shiv into ESG
so if you're not embarrassed to be
promoting ESG
it's time you should be
you should be embarrassed
that you were ever part of this
maybe someday an apology to the country
for the Damage Done but at the moment
we'll do a little test to see if dogbert
still has the mocking ability to take
something out of the public interest
we'll see
so that's for you
have you heard of uh something in the
technology world called a chiplet
chiplet
I like to I like to make sure that my
audience is like the cool people when
you go to the party
and somebody says hey
have you heard of chiplets
and everybody else will be like what
what's a giblet and then you're like
there with your drink you're just
looking cool you're just there ah
chiplets yeah you mean like the Lego uh
chips are putting together yeah
and know all about the chiplets
see that's what you got to do
and I'm getting you I'm getting you
ready for that by telling you what a
chiplin is so it's in the news today
it's a big deal some Say it'll be like
one of the biggest advances in
technology and chips could actually
change a lot here's what it is at the
moment if you wanted to make something
like a phone or any device digital
device it probably is going to require
more than one chip
so you might have a video chip in the
processing chip and some other kind of
chip
and they've got to talk to each other so
you kind of wire them together with
these little wires it's kind of very
inefficient
however the idea is that the chip making
people are getting together to make
their chips just interconnect
so somebody makes a video chip but you
make another kind of chip and you just
take your Chips and you go click and you
just click them together now apparently
this is going to be an enormous
um breakthrough
as much because it makes it easy to
design things as it does to put them
together so assembly would be easier
cheaper you could you could build new
things that you didn't even think about
just by taking chips off the shelf add
some software slap them together you got
a new device
and presumably you could then easily
expand your device
so you might have a device that can do
XYZ but you think to yourself what if I
added another chip
you just snap it in there so it could
change everything
might and next time you're at a party
and somebody says what about those
chiplets
c-h-i-p like a chip l-e-t
you'll be the smartest person at the
party
you're welcome
well this is tragic news tragic actor
Ron Perlman has announced he's leaving
Twitter for Threads
that's uh that's like learning that a
cancerous spot has been removed from
your ass
oh
I'll certainly miss that cancerous spot
on my ass
who's going to threads and I thought to
myself I just wondered what uh
was Zuckerberg thought when he saw that
now if you don't follow Ron Perlman you
would have to know he's the most
dislikable person who's ever been on
Twitter
like he's really he really takes it to
the extreme of being unlikable so he's
not just having a point of view
he tries really hard to make you dislike
him and he does a good job at it
is a really good job of making you don't
not like him personally but that's part
of the act so part of the ACT is he's
trying to be the you know the most
unpleasant person he can online and it
works for him it works for him but I
wonder what's going to happen
suppose the the most crazy people from
the left
actually did leave
what would Twitter look like if the
craziest people left
would be better or worse
would be boring
because I've I've certainly had fun
looking at Ron Perlman tweets and
watching people get all worked up and
interacting with them
I kind of enjoyed it
you know it wasn't really a healthy
dopamine hit it was more like you know
the weird pleasure you get when you see
something horrible happen to somebody
else
you know you know that you feel bad you
might feel empathy but at the same time
you're like interested in it you're
thinking ugh
why am I interested
like you hate yourself for a little
while
anyway
when I think of roadkill I think of Ron
Perlman
so he's gone
um has anybody seen any difference in in
Twitter
since threads came out
is anybody logged on to Twitter and said
hey this is completely different now
and I saw the new uh the new head of
Twitter whose name I don't remember but
you'll tell me
um said that Twitter had its biggest
traffic day just the other day
so the biggest traffic day since
February
they had just the other day
so apparently Twitter uh yes thank you
Yak Arena
the CEO so
isn't that weird that her
it's an app it's an app where people Yak
at each other
isn't that weird we're actually on using
a it's an app where people literally Yak
at each other and the habit of the
company is yakarino
Circle Jerks
for Threads that's funny
all right so I've used threads a number
of times now
I feel like I just I didn't know what
was going on over there
um
but I don't know how many people had the
same experience I do I mentioned this
before one of the things threads can do
is it can move your
um the people you follow
but not the people you follow but not
the people who follow you I think you
can take the people that you follow and
then follow them on threats
so I'm not sure how other people use
Twitter versus Instagram but I don't do
the same things on Twitter that I do on
Instagram
on Instagram I'm more likely to do a
picture of my dog
right or like a funny sign I saw
somewhere
um but on Twitter you know I'm talking
about politics and world events and
nuclear power and stuff so when I
brought all of the people over that I
follow
um on threads it just became Instagram
it was basically just Instagram but you
know what happened
I probably shouldn't admit this but I
think you would have guessed it without
my help
on Instagram I do sometimes follow
people because the way they look I know
I know
I know I'm terrible
but I admit it this is my confession
sometimes I'll follow people on
Instagram
solely because of their looks
There It Is I've admitted it
God I feel dirty
but I do
sometimes I follow them just because of
how they look now this will surprise you
this is something you didn't see coming
but if you pour over all the people you
follow because of the way they look
your experience on threads is very
different
from the people on Twitter that I follow
because they say brilliant things
so on Instagram
I don't know if I follow Mike cernovich
or Jack posabic I don't think I do
but they're out there saying brilliant
stuff
but when you pour over all the people
who look good into threads do you know
what they do
when you move them to threads
they start making text only posts
oh my God
do you know how to make beautiful women
seem unattractive
listen to their text tweets and read
them
you'll be like oh God I thought you were
so pretty but oh stopped waiting or
threading or whatever the hell they're
doing over there stop it you're just
ruining it you're ruining it stop
talking stop
so that was my experience my experience
is I brought over all the dumbest people
and they're all talking
I don't mind looking at dumb people if
they look good but but listening to them
talk is almost unbearable
so that was my experience now so your
experience on threats should be unique
to each person right because if if you
were following Politics on both
and you brought him over like Don Jr for
example
um I would guess he's mostly following
political stuff and same people he
follows on Twitter so his Instagram on
if he moved it to threads would probably
look like Twitter
but I don't know about the rest of you
the rest of you might have my situation
do I follow my ex of course
yeah we follow each other on Instagram
of course we do yeah no I have I have a
good situation
all right let's talk about the JFK
assassination
uh old news that's never goes out of
fashion Rasmussen had a poll asking
people what they thought about the
government's role this assassination and
or what or was it alone government I
guess that's the question or was it a
conspiracy so 38 percent think it was a
conspiracy
um 38 think it was a lone gunman so it's
exactly the same number I think it's a
conspiracy or a loan government but I
wonder how many are undecided
about a quarter of the people don't have
an opinion on this about a quarter of
the people it's a weird one though
because I don't know if they're right or
wrong in this case
um but here's the the updated news that
on midnight Friday rasmussen's tweeting
this
um midnight on Friday which is where you
go to release the news you don't want
the public to know
because that that doesn't get picked up
by the news people is because it's late
night Friday
so at late night Friday the Biden
Administration the White House announced
that it would be uh not releasing some
of the documents about the JFK
assassination
because of security concerns
well can you even imagine in your mind
what would be a con security concern
that would still be relevant low these
many decades later what would that be
I can only think of one thing
I'm going to tell you what I think it is
and then I want you to tell me if you
can think of any other hypothesis even a
hypothesis
right
I believe that the documents would show
the government or maybe just the CIA but
the government in some way
was involved in it and the security
problem is that we would lose faith in
our government
or the CIA
and that that's considered a security
problem because the the if the public
doesn't have a little bit of trust in
the government Things Fall Apart
I think it's because they're guilty and
they can't tell you
now I'm not I would not I don't think I
would necessarily place a life and death
bet on being right
there could be some other reason
but if there's another reason
can anybody speculate what that might be
because there's no technology that would
be relevant
there shouldn't be any like surveillance
issues that would still be relevant in
modern times there shouldn't be anybody
alive
I don't think anybody still alive
who was who was in power at the time
because they would be they would all
aged down right the people in charge
like were like 50 50 years ago
or how many years ago it was
um so they should all be dead
so we're not protecting people and he
didn't even say that they didn't say
they were protecting people they said it
was
you know something important
so what could it be other than is proof
positive that something in the
government was wrong and baby still is
maybe still is
yeah what a what if an Allied country
was involved
ah
now you've got a reason to keep it
secret don't you suppose some other
country was involved
and it's an ally
just imagine that just imagine it's an
ally
I don't think we would release it
because it would damage us when we're
trying to stay Allied to fight Ukraine
or not fight Russia or whoever we're
fighting
so I would say that uh and I I say this
I'll say this again even today that when
the government doesn't tell you all the
details you should assume the worst case
about the government doesn't mean you're
right
but just as you should assume innocence
for a citizen until proven guilty when
the government says I'm not going to
tell you
you should assume guilt
does everybody believe that that's a
reasonable assumption assume the
government is guilty of something
horrible if they won't tell you what's
going on
60 years after the fact if it was
something that happened yesterday then I
would say oh this could be legitimate
national security I'd better wait and
see
but I've waited long enough
I I feel like I've waited long enough on
the Kennedy assassination
at this point if there's something
they're not telling us
I have no assumption other than massive
illegal or bad behavior from the
government I can't imagine any other
possibility
can you
can you propose even a speculative you
know wild eyed
brainstorming idea of what else it could
be aliens oh that's pretty good it was
an alien assassination
the kids would sue
I don't know maybe
it could reveal who really runs the
government but but what it revealed that
60 years after the fact
because whoever runs the government is
probably not the same today unless
you're saying it's an organization
that still exists which I don't know
maybe anything's possible
but the working assumption is the
government was behind it I think that
they've essentially signaled that
all right
here's uh the the news that's no
surprise to anybody the Biden Department
of Justice uh is is announcing multiple
indictments Against The Whistleblower
who claims he has direct evidence that
the bidens were paid by Chinese entities
and other entities for
stuff that's sketchy
so big surprise
isn't that a big surprise
so let me try to put this in context for
you
as you know from the day of Joseph
Goebbels
uh it has been classic dictator move to
accuse your critics of the thing they're
accusing you of actually the thing you
did
I should say it differently you should
accuse your critics of doing the crime
that you actually did
apparently that's a Gobles you know Nazi
idea now Tucker Carlson I famously
always talk about because he always used
to say this and I thought it was crazy
talk that the Democrats are accusing the
Republicans of whatever crime they're
doing to me that sounded just
just too clever
to political not really something based
on actual things happening I have now
completely revised my opinion of that
it looks like it's a it's I mean it
looks intentional it's so consistent
it's hard to imagine it's accidental
and here's here's another example so the
indictments now remember that the claim
from The Whistleblower is that uh the
bidens were working with China
in a illegal fashion that involved a
transfer of money right that's the
whistleblowers claim so what do you
think he's indicted for
that
that
are you kidding me he's indicted
for that
now they're calling him a Chinese spy
do you think he's a Chinese spy
does anybody think that now you'd have
to see him talking
but what was the last time there was a
Chinese spy who wasn't ethnically
Chinese
do we have a big history of that
like a like a big history of Chinese
spies
like actual spies
who are not ethnically Chinese has that
ever happened
well the bidens are just taking money
that's different
no swallow swalwell's girlfriend was
ethnically Chinese and she was a spy
is there any evidence ever of a Chinese
spy who was not
ethnically Chinese
right so we're we're being and and do
you think and what is his nationality
The Whistleblower is Israeli right
is Israel is double maybe double
citizenship or something
so he's American Israeli
or is he just Israeli
give me a fact check on that I thought
he was double citizenship but I'm not
sure but how many
like in your experience
do you see the Israeli being a Chinese
spy
does that is that like that feels right
I mean it's possible right it's possible
but wouldn't that be the most unusual
pattern you've ever seen
if you're using pattern recognition here
what are the one of the odds that this
whistleblower and and the pattern you're
seeing developing around the accusations
about him he's a Chinese spy
of all things
that seems like the the least likely
possibility based on pattern recognition
not based on facts because we don't have
access to whatever facts they're dealing
with
just based on pattern now let's do the
other pattern
that this is once again the hundredth in
a row time that the Democrats have
blamed somebody on the other team or
some other team of doing the exact crime
they're doing
what are the odds that that's what's
happening
really really high
now I can't prove it I'm not I'm not not
making any factual argument it's not a
factual argument it's a pattern argument
are we really supposed to buy that the
pattern that holds almost every time
is not happening but the pattern you've
never seen and would never expect to see
ever in your life is the real thing
that's happening
that's the real thing that's happening
unfreakin believable
that you know am I stereotyping that's
what a pattern is
somebody asked if I'm stereotyping what
do you think a pattern is
that's what a pattern is
I mean if if the pattern is based on
facts that's what it is otherwise it
would be just pure discrimination
all right so of course Keith olberman is
just crowing that all of the
all of the evidence against the bidens
has been now debunked
that's what Keith olber says that all
the evidence has now been debunked
against the bidens taking money from any
foreign entities all debunked Keith
olberman says
yep
all right I saw a tweet by uh Balaji
Serena Vasan who you should all be
following on Twitter
um
but he showed a clip he said the U.S
Secretary of the Navy recently admitted
that one Chinese Shipyard has more
shipbuilding capacity than the entire
U.S Navy what
just one Shipyard
of 13 I think there are 13 of them in
China just one of their 13 can build
more Navy ships than all of our
facilities combined
well that's okay because we have a huge
we have a huge advantage in ships it'll
take them a long time to catch up right
is that what you're thinking gonna take
him a long time to catch up
currently the US has 300 Navy ships and
China has
oh
340.
so at the current rate
this is just me guessing this is not
part of the story
China would have a thousand when we had
350 because we have ambitious plans to
make up to 350 ships so that'd be 50
extra we think we could get there in
maybe a few decades
Channel 11
000.
they're basically going to own the ocean
it appears to be the Chinese plan is to
own the ocean
which is largely just a volume question
isn't it if you have enough ships don't
you kind of own the ocean
so that's not good
although one wonders how much Navy ships
are worth in the era of
drones and whatnot it seems like
it seems like all of the Navy ships
would sink the first two days of any war
between China and the U.S I feel like
that the ocean would just be
just empty of ships because I don't know
how you can really protect a ship from a
superpower
you can protect the ship from Iran
but do you think you could protect the
ship from a superpower with superpower
weapons
I feel like not
it feels like it doesn't matter how many
there are
all right
reason the publication called reason
um tweeted this RFK Jr is not worthy of
The Rehabilitation tour he's getting
from various pundits huh I believe I
would be one of those various pundits
I'm not one of the important ones but
I'm one of the various pundits who is
giving RFK Jr a lot of positive
attention
and they say that uh you know various
pundits podcasters and Tech illuminaries
and they say reason says he pushes
tabloid quality quote reporting and he
wildly extrapolates from Little grades
of Truth
so then they wrote a hit piece about all
of his conspiracy theorizing
I didn't read it I assume it's full of
fact checking all right so I tweeted
back and last I saw I had like three
quarters of a million views so I know it
was hitting on some kind of a note but I
tweeted back at the reason I said in
2023 a conspiracy theorist is more
credible than the government he
criticizes
do you think that's a fair statement in
2023
a conspiracy theorist no matter who it
is but let's just say it's somebody who
you know is a notable person
you know not a crazy person but a
notable person somebody you know did the
did the work did the homework
um I would say that it's just a fact
that in 2023 The Conspiracy Theory
conspiracy theorists has more
credibility than the government that
they're criticizing
would you agree
and I think that maybe that was not the
case always but at the moment it's very
much the case
and I and others said the same that
reason is part of the problem
and part of the problem is that nobody
will give RFK Jr a reasonable airing
sitting next to somebody who would
disagree with him
who whose problem is this situation
let's say reason is right let's you know
hypothetically let's say that that
they're right that RFK junior is a big
old conspiracy
theorist and he's wrong about all these
important things and he just keeps going
out there and saying wrong stuff
who's
whose job was it to fix that
who has the job to fix wrong information
the media right if he's out there it's
because you're not doing your job and
you know it doesn't work writing a hair
piece about him that doesn't work in
2023. in 2023 if there's a hit piece
about you it's just as much a badge of
honor as it is a criticism there is no
such thing as a hit piece against a
conservative
that makes any difference to
conservatives
because they don't see it as a hippies
they see it as a sign that somebody's
making a dent somebody said you know is
breaking through
so that's not going to work now how
could reason magazine not be aware of
what I just told you
how could they not be aware
that they're part of what makes RFK Jr
dangerous
do you know how to make him not
dangerous
invite him on the show with somebody who
disagrees with them but really knows
their stuff
why not that why not just invite him do
you think he'll say no do you think RFK
Jr will say oh no I'm not going to go on
this reason you know event
because I I'm afraid of talking to
somebody who disagrees with me and has
some facts
do you think you say no
no I think if somebody is willing to
talk in public have a long public record
of interacting with this data clearly
are educated and smart and really good
communicators the only way you're going
to stop that message if you think it's
dangerous
is you're gonna have to put up somebody
better
you're gonna have to beat his message
and you can't beat it with a hippies
because hit piece tells me he's right
I don't think he's right by the way I
don't think RFK Jr is right
about all of his claims
my best guess without doing you know a
deep dive in every claim if I had to
guess
he's right about some
he's wrong about some
and he raises exactly the right question
about a lot
that would be my guess I don't know
but if you can't clear that up for me by
putting him on the same venue in the
same event with somebody who disagrees
so they can talk it out in front of me
so I could watch
I I'm not I'm not buying I'm not buying
he's the problem
he's a lot closer to the solution than
the problem
because he's a well-informed person who
wants to do this in public
that's the solution
he's a free speech absolutist
yes I want to talk about this right in
front of everybody I want everybody to
look at my data I want everybody to look
at my stuff I want everybody to evaluate
me
and I I imagine if you were shown to be
wrong in a credible way he might change
his opinion because he doesn't seem
crazy
he seems like somebody who did his
research and came to an opinion that's
different the years
or sometimes
yeah
so
I think the reason needs to look in the
window in the mirror here
um
New York Times is reporting that Donald
Trump's lawyers are asking for a delay
in this documents case you know the
mar-a-lagio boxes uh trying to get a
delay to get it
to be delayed enough that it looks like
it's going to interfere with the
election
so that a judge will have to decide
does the judge decide who wins the
election
or does the judge say We'll delay this
until after four years I guess
which of course he could pardon himself
so that so that that's no delay at all
um
so in other words does the court say
that Trump is as his critics will say
above the law
will he be above the law as in they
won't prosecute because he's running for
president that would look very much like
above the law
on the other hand as a citizen of the
United States I'm not really sure I want
a major candidate taken out by a legal
claim from
the other side
that feels like a terrible precedent so
there are two bad choices right
basically badly the way you go
but I would give a certainly a kudos to
Trump's lawyers because it seems to me
that's exactly the right play
from you know my my limited
non-legal expertise
um it looks to me like delaying it until
it becomes confused with politics
that looks like a really good play would
you agree
does that look like the right play to
you
to me it does
because you know I think the entire
thing is political
so if he uses a a political maneuver to
get out of a legal problem that wasn't
only a legal problem because it was
political
that seems entirely fair to me that's
just Judo just using their energy
against them it's like okay if you want
to confuse politics if you want to
confuse politics of the law
game on let's confuse politics with the
law let's take it to the next level if
you want to confuse this if you want
politics
and the law to be mingled you got your
wish you got your wish let's mingle them
let the judge decide
not bad
I like how aggressive it is
well Evanston illinois
is going to be paying reparations to
African Americans who live in the town
I assume all the money comes from taxes
of the local residents I don't know that
it would come from anywhere else
the story is a little vague on that
but why do you think Evanston is
successfully if you can call it that
implementing reparations
when other places have less luck
why do you think that is
like what would cause them to be
successful
I have a theory it's because they have a
low population of Asian Americans
that's my theory because white Americans
can't push back as much as they might
like to because they just look like
racists
but the reason that the Harvard
affirmative action thing went the way it
did is because the the major proponents
of ending affirmative action were Asian
Americans
and because they were not white
Americans who were widely considered the
Masters of the Universe and therefore
deserving of nothing
um they could get away I'll say get away
with or let's say succeed I'll say
succeed that's a better word so the
Asian Americans could succeed in
something very positive for the Republic
they just happened to be good for White
Citizens as well
now
I I would bet you that Evanston has a
low percentage of Asian Americans
without checking I didn't check but I'm
guessing that's the reason that the
white residents are somewhat helpless
and will just be paying money to Black
residents of Evanston
in effect through the through taxes
do you think I'm wrong would anybody bet
against me that what's going on there is
a low percentage of Asian Americans in
Evanston
because the whites the white citizens
are just helpless they're just going to
go with every whatever's woke but the
Asian Americans can just say you
right they can just say you
and everybody goes oh it's coming from
you okay I'll listen to that
so
that's an interesting situation I guess
Jake Tapper was talking to somebody and
said that he's not going to shy away
from the hunter laptop or the Bryden you
know the Biden money scandals
um but in the same story I saw how
little he talked about it basically
ignored the entire story
for most of the time it was a hot story
and it mattered but now that it you know
now that that time has gone by and Biden
got elected and it doesn't matter
politically so much oh now he's going to
talk about it because I don't think the
Democrats are really looking for a Biden
second run
I doubt that Jake Tapper is thinking to
himself oh God
things would be so good if Biden got
reelected I doubt it because I just
don't think anybody's thinking that
they would prefer it over Trump I get
that but nobody's thinking Biden's the
good deal so I think the word is out the
even the Democrats can give Biden to
shiv at this point because they're
they're going to try to hasten his
removal before so they can give somebody
in there who might win
but I was wondering what it's like to be
Jake Tapper
so here's this clear well-documented
situation where
um he
for money
as his profession
he uh gave you fake news
and by fake news I mean he ignored the
real news that would have changed how
you thought about a lot of things so I
call that fake news ignoring real news
if your job is to report the news
so
how can you be
how embarrassing is it
to present yourself as a news
professional
when the news itself the news itself has
clearly defined you as a purveyor of
fake news a misinformation purveyor
by Omission as much as inclusion
how embarrassing is that do you think he
actually has any embarrassment about
that
or or do people just get used to their
situation and it doesn't even occur to
them to be embarrassed
I I literally got uh I literally got
canceled worldwide
and
I will be way more embarrassed to be him
than me
it wouldn't even be close I would be
like I wouldn't be able to go out
outside of my house if I were him
I mean he actually may have helped
change
you know change the direction of the
country and started a war
let me just put this out there
if Jake Tapper had aggressively reported
on the laptop from the first moment as
well as you know allegations from
whistleblowers and everything do you
think uh do you think Biden would have
been elected
just ask yourself would Biden have been
elected if just one thing had changed
just one person Jake Tapper doing his
actual job
instead of doing something that looks
political from the outside ignoring the
laptop story
if the only thing he'd done is his job
is it possible that the war in Ukraine
would not have happened
seriously the war in Ukraine
is because Biden's President right
would Biden be president if Jake Tapper
just that one person had aggressively
reported on the laptop and all that
implied about the Biden crime family
Jake Tapper may have killed hundreds of
thousands of people
by not doing his job right
am I wrong
now I'm not saying that you know that's
a direct line you know from Jake Tapper
to dead people but it's pretty Direct
is fairly direct yeah I'll say it again
Jake Tapper doesn't do his job and he
ignores the laptop story which would
have said a lot about the possibility of
the Biden crime family corruption thing
if that had done enough let's say if he
had been aggressive about it if that had
been enough to change the narrative and
I think it would have because CNN
reports that everybody on the left gets
to see it
so if he had done that you'd probably
have a president Trump
or at least there's a better chance
don't know that for sure that would be a
leap but polls polls do seem to suggest
a number of people would have changed
their votes had they known
so that's the only reason that there's a
major war in Europe
how many people are dying because of the
Ukraine war and wounded to me that's on
Jake Tapper
am I wrong
Jake Tapper is responsible for every
injury and every death in Ukraine
because if he's simply done his job
it wouldn't have happened
I'm not wrong
I you know you can't prove that chain of
connection because there are too many
other variables but it is fairly Direct
it's hard to imagine that Biden would
have been elected if Tapper was
reporting on the laptop the same way
that Fox News was
and I think that Fox News has been
proven to be completely accurate on the
laptop every bit of it seems to have
been proven out
so I would be living in shame if I had
created a war that killed hundreds of
thousands of people
but uh just remind you on on the
canceled one
I'm the canceled one
just keep that in mind
I'm canceled
Jake Tapper probably started a World War
by not doing his job and knowing and
probably knowing he wasn't doing his job
wow
um correct me if I'm wrong do you all
know what the super delegates are the
Democrats have super delegates
Republicans do not now give me some fact
checks because this is not some area
that I know a lot about but the super
delegates are people who will go to the
Democratic Convention
and when they cast their vote it counts
for way more than a regular delegate's
vote because that's the system they set
up and these so-called super delegates
are so super that they kind of depend
they decide who won so it's a little bit
of uh smoke and mirrors to look like the
convention is real
it's not a real convention it's a
handful of super delegates who decide
who's going to be the nominee and then
everybody else pretends they're part of
the system but they're really not
they're really not now to me that's just
like the Chinese Communist Party
it's the same system
now you it's possible that chairman or
is it chairman she he may have you know
taken over dictatorial Powers at this
point but prior to that
it was a whole bunch of super delegates
who were the head of the Chinese
Communist party they would decide who
the candidates were
and they would largely decided one
how is that really different than the
Democrats they've got super delegates
the Communist party has the Communist
Party leaders
they're in they're unelected individuals
who decide who can run for office
and then the system supports their their
Ascension
it's basically just communist China
system it's not actually very different
than Iran's
so Iran's system of picking the the top
leader it's the mullets right so there's
a bunch of unelected mullahs
and here I really don't know what I'm
talking about so probably even
pronouncing all the words wrong but they
get together and then they decide who's
their boss
that's just what the super delegates are
is basically an Iran communist China
government system now as long as the
Republicans were competitive
you didn't mind so much did you
like you didn't care too much how the
Democrats picked their leader as long as
you had a fair fight in the end and you
could you put forward your own champion
right it's a private it's a private
organization
you know you're not forced to be a
Democrat if you don't like that super
delegate thing it just registers a
Republican or an independent so you can
just opt out which makes it perfectly
legal because it's not mandatory
but
what happens if the Democrats get enough
let's say control of the entire system
which might include the voting systems
so that the Challenger can never win
are we close to that
are we close to a point where the
Challenger can't win no matter who the
Challenger is
feels like it if we're not there we're
close to it so we might be you know like
a hair's breath away
from essentially a communist system
which is the leader is going to be a
Democrat because they're going to win no
matter what and the Democrat is not
selected by a popular vote
they are they are elected by super
delegates who are connected to the the
power base of the party
and if they can't lose
which we're getting to that point where
they can't lose
then you just have
China
and
doesn't China does China have elections
China has elections right but the
elections at least for the you know at
least for she the election isn't real
right because you do you don't really
have you know actual real choices now
this is why somebody like Trump is so
important
uh I would imagine Iran DeSantis would
just get rolled by the Democrat machine
somebody like a trump
potentially
could slice through any amount of noise
because he has that superpower it
doesn't matter how much you know noise
or machine is running against them he
does have the power to slice through it
and dismantle it very rare right now it
has to do with the fact that he will
take any amount of pain to get what he
wants
I think I think Trump is deeply
underestimated
for how much pain he is willing to
endure personally
to get done what he thinks needs to get
done it's actually very impressive the
the amount of pain he willingly takes on
you know the criticism Etc
um
so he's a singular character who might
be the only thing keeping you from
a communist-like government in effect
so we'll see we'll see what happens
there
so a bunch of Republicans House
Republicans are introducing to uh some
kind of a voting bill that would apply
to all the states
uh usually the States run their
elections but the federal government
could have some
um some input here if this got approved
and here's what they're trying to get
done I doubt it will get passed but what
they're trying to get done is that
let's see what would it do uh to improve
our elections uh you photo ID would be
required so that would they would like
to make it required in all states
um for for a federal election it
wouldn't be required by this law for a
state election but it would borrow
non-citizens from voting
it would require annual maintenance of
voter rolls and this is kind of key
prevents the mailing of unsolicited
ballots to roles that have not been
maintained
so if you can't show that your voter
rules have been you know massaged to be
accurate you can't even send down
ballots
because you'd be sending them to people
who don't exist and that creates
opportunity for fraud
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna allow this
all capital letters I'm going to make an
exception here and I told you I block
everybody with capital letter comments
but I'm going to let this one go from my
heck all the capitals I want
I want to marry a guy just like Scott if
not that I'm not getting married
allowed
allowed
approved
so I guess capital letters aren't so bad
after all
not so bad after all
right
so given the given what the Republicans
are asking for I think you could assume
they would get zero Democrat votes
so it doesn't look like it could pass
but I love that they're putting it out
there
so I would say this is this is good work
by the Republicans
because they're gonna they're forcing
the uh
forcing the Democrats
[Laughter]
somebody's chanting at all caps USA USA
like damn it what am I going to say
about that no get your patriotism away
from me
ah
all right well it's good play by the
Republicans to make the Democrats answer
for why the elections don't have these
controls
right uh I saw Dr Jordan Peterson
disagreeing with Elon Musk
isn't that fun
has that ever happened before
you know I have this theory that when
you reach a certain level of
intelligence everybody at that level of
intelligence has the same opinions
no I'm sure it's not literally true
but it feels like it it feels like it
like yeah as some level of intelligence
people have the same information and the
same ability to process that information
usually most disagreements are
disagreements and information
or diffs agreements or let's say
different abilities to reason
now some people are just taking a team
team perspective but if you look at Dr
Jordan Peterson or Elon Musk those are
two people that are respect immensely
for their intelligence specifically
but I would also say that these are two
people who would easily easily be able
to go against their team
would you agree with both those
statements they're both immensely
intelligent and both of them has shown
that they could it would just depend on
the topic they could go against the
people that you know you imagine are on
their side
easily and they could do it without a
hiccup
like no there would be no friction there
at all
I believe that they could go against
their their their biggest supporters in
a heartbeat without even a hesitation so
that makes them two of the most valuable
people in the country even though Jordan
Peterson's Canadian but in terms of the
value of the United States
you give somebody who's that smart who
can also change their mind
that's just gold
like like that's that's what makes your
country work you got you need a few of
those Mike cervich same thing you
recently tweeted that he made a mistake
in his words a mistake thinking that
DeSantis was gonna you know rise and win
the primary
now when you see somebody like
Mike cernovich
um easily and effortlessly say oh this
thing I said was very very I was very
sure about was 100 wrong and now let's
go on
like that's such a credibility Builder
because nobody's right about predictions
right like you know you can be the best
predictor in the world
which happens to be me and I still get
plenty wrong right so being wrong is
nothing
you know kind of no kind of shock that's
just part of the process so here's uh
here's where Jordan Peterson and Elon
Musk disagree
which I find fascinating and it's uh
Elon Musk said something about he would
protect Anonymous users on Twitter
and that if you wanted to be anonymous
on Twitter as long as you're following
the guidelines uh Elon Musk says
absolutely you can be anonymous on
Twitter
uh Dr Jordan Peterson says in a
um in a tweet to Elon Musk he says
anonymity enables the dark tetrad types
I'll explain that uh Elon Musk
um and unopposed they will take us all
down it's a big mistake Sir with all due
respect
now I do love to see the respect that
you know he pays the musk because he
knows musk isn't doing stupid
right so that is worthy of respect even
if you disagree a lot you know he
thought it through right but they
disagree now the the expertise that
Jordan Peterson is bringing to it is
this dark tetrad thing
uh I'll give you the the dumb guy's
explanation there are some people who
are terrible
that's a simple explanation they're
narcissists they're they're trolls
they're looking for trouble but there's
a personality type who's looking for
Destruction
and if you give them a way to destroy
things anonymously you're going to get a
lot of those people because it's the
perfect you know sadist place to go
so if you're Dr Jordan Peterson and
you've done a I believe he had a
clinical practice right
so he would have had both research and
experienced life experience plus maybe
clinical experience with this dark
tetrad personality
when he tells you they could destroy
your world
he's not guessing
you know what I mean
he's not guessing
this is his sweet spot this is exactly
where one of the smartest people in
public life Peterson this is exactly his
Mary of expertise he knows this stuff so
when he disagrees with Musk you know
musk is coming from a freedom of speech
perspective which of course we all
appreciate but when you when you add the
the real life effect of unleashing
sadists with no controls
you know as long as they follow the
guidelines no controls
um that that could be deadly it could
actually destroy the country
now
I have not formed an opinion on this yet
I'm still mulling it because when you
see when you see people this smart
and this well-informed disagreeing on
something if you immediately take sides
with one of them you should ask yourself
if there's something wrong with you
right if you're too quick to pick a side
that's not a good look in this case
because frankly both of them are smarter
than you
they're both smarter than me
so you know I don't say that lightly
you've watched me long enough I don't
say that lightly they're both smarter
than I am
it's just obvious right so when they
disagree
my first my first thought is oh damn
what am I going to do now
because I had to be on the other side of
either one of them
that's a terrible place to be but if you
want to if you want to find a way where
they could agree or some way to you know
make those two opposite views the same
I would say the way to get there is
through preferences
it's not a different of a difference in
opinion of what might happen
it's a difference in preference
so I think Elon Musk would say if the
ship is going to go down
let's go down with free speech
and I think Jordan Peterson is saying I
don't think you see how big this risk is
no I don't know maybe maybe musk does
see how big that risk is but he still
prefers it so it's a risk reward thing
where nobody can be 100 sure the size of
the risk
and nobody can quite be sure the size of
a reward
so it's so subjective that intelligence
doesn't quite
you know get you to the final answer
where you normally would
but in this case you kind of have to use
your gut
and I think elon's gut says Free Speech
has never not worked
everywhere you've tried it
it works everywhere you take it away
you're
that's a pretty simple rule but could
there be an exception you know could
Twitter be an exception because of this
anonymity thing
and uh I'm a little undecided a little
bit undecided
I can certainly see Jordan Peterson's
argument
but
um
you know a an absolutist approach to
free speech
it's hard to argue against that either
you know for adults anyway
so I thought that was fascinating with
much respect to both individuals
uh I'd love to hear him discuss it well
here's another one
don't you think you want to see the show
where Elon and Jordan Peterson just sit
down and talk about just this nothing
else
give us 15 minutes on this
you know bring us bring us into the
question we'd like we'd like to be part
of that at least with our opinions
so
I know who do you think is going to
break the seal on this
so I I say that there's a thing that's
inevit inevitable because everybody
feels it now uh and that is you're gonna
have to create platforms where the
people who are smart
and disagree
can get in front of the public
it might be that calling it a debate is
where everything goes wrong
that might be our mistake because we
sort of reflexively call it a debate if
we called it a conversation maybe we
could get them to sit down
what do you think
how about a one-topic conversation
I'd love to see somebody who has some
clout
you know a Bill Maher type something
like that David sacks somebody like that
I'd like to say let's do some
um 15-minute conversations on one topic
and we'll just we'll put good people on
both and we'll give them just enough
time that they can definitely say what
they need to say if it needs to go
longer than 15 minutes we'll do it but
we're not going to let anybody not say
what they need to say
and
I feel like if anybody ever pulled that
off and the hard part is getting people
to participate because as I've told you
a number of times
whichever side is already winning they
don't want to debate
that would be crazy but I do think that
somebody of a high enough statue could
get him to do it
for example and this is not a real
example if ex-president Obama
said look we got some big issues here's
the best thing I can do for the country
I'm going to bring on this this expert
and this expert and I'm going to talk to
him and I'm going to ask both of them
some tough questions now if Joe Rogan
asks let's say a doctor or whatever to
come on you can still say no to Joe
Rogan
am I right
you can still say no to him he's hard to
say no to because he's so important at
this point but if Obama asked two people
who's going to say no
right
who would say no
I think you'd say yes because simply
because of who's asking
so you could probably find some public
figure
who people can't say no to it might be
Oprah let's take Oprah
right if Oprah calls you and says I want
I want the two of you to see here and
I'm going to ask you some questions on
this one topic
would you say no to Oprah
I know she's just too
just too much part of our national
fabric I think I would say yes
even if I had some questions about how
it would go I'd I'd lean toward it
so my prediction is that somebody is
going to break the seal on that
somebody's going to know oh I could pull
this off and I think it's going to have
to be somebody who's believe it or not
higher than
um Joe Rogan in terms of national
say credibility
now I also think
that you might have a better luck with a
Democrat as the host
here's why
if a Democrat invites let's say a
pro-vaccination person to give their
views
then they're going to at least trust
that the host will let them do their
thing
and that's what they're worried about
because they don't want to lose the
debate because they already won right
they have everything they want they
don't need to debate but if but if but
if your team invites you
if Obama your God
says you know we better defend this
better you know help me defend whatever
the view is I think they'd say yes now
how about the Republicans
can you name me a time a republican ran
from a debate go
nothing right
name a time a Republican
said no to a debate on anything
to Trump 2023.
yeah but Trump is not looking to debate
the topics if Trump and DeSantis have a
conversation they would agree on all the
policies
so so when Trump doesn't talk to
somebody who agrees with him it's
because it's not about the topic
Trump versus desantis's personality
right you're getting the same basically
the same uh policies but you're voting
for The Character you think can you
execute and not destroy the country for
other reasons
so if Trump decides not to debate
um I would say I would be disappointed
because I want the entertainment but he
wouldn't be making a bad decision and it
wouldn't be bad for the country because
whoever you know the whatever the
Republican primary produces it's going
to look a lot the same
except for the personality and we don't
need to debate on personality
so I think if you have a Democrat host
they can get the Democrat to say yes
because they'd feel safe and the
Republican always says yes
tell me which show vivec would not go on
right
just just take one one example so fake
ramaswamy there's no show or no
conversation he'll say no to if it's
legitimate
he would be he would be there in a
heartbeat
so you could definitely pull it off
who would RFK Jr say no to
for a debate on his favorite topic if
it's credible people you wouldn't say no
to anybody
so you've got all these candidates out
there who are saying I'm not going to
say no
I'm going to say yes but she got to get
the Democrats on board so you're gonna
have to have a Democrat host
I think that Joe Rogan as the host of in
you know people who disagree I think
that's a non-starter I think he's
exactly the wrong person
and I have a huge positive opinion of
Joe Rogan by the way it's just that the
position he's in in the country whoever
it was in that position would not be the
ideal moderator for important issues
because he looks to others like he's on
one side
and that just won't work
now personally I would rather have a
Democrat host if I were debating
do you know why
do you know why I I would prefer a
Democrat host if I were part of a debate
with somebody else in the stage
because the because the Democrat is
going to push me
I wouldn't want to be in the debate
unless I could be pushed as hard as they
can push
and then I still overcome
I don't want to waste my time with some
with something where they said well the
debate was kind of friendly to you and
so we didn't really see anything happen
that's a waste of time I I want the one
who could crush me with their arguments
and if I don't get crushed it's going to
be news like if you can get out of the
if you get out of the hardest trap
well then you've done something useful
right if it's not the hardest trap
it's probably not worth the effort
all right
they'll say that anyway I suppose they
will
all right that's all I got for today uh
YouTube I'm gonna say bye obviously this
was the best live stream you've ever
seen and I'll see you tomorrow
