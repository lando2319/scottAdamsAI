maybe somebody you could tell
hello everybody we're doing another
experiment to see if I can live stream
on YouTube and Rumble at the same time
through stream yard it hasn't worked yet
I'm over three but quickly let me just
check Rumble
and see if it's streaming there
because apparently I can't spell Rumble
we call that up and see if I'm there
that looks like Noah
probably not right
so interesting all right can can anybody
confirm that it's not working on Rumble
and then we'll never try that again
okay
can you confirm it's definitely not
there on Rumble right
okay so uh that's the last time I'll try
let's do the uh let's do the opening
show okay
because I know you have OCD and I've got
to do it the same every time
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a finer moment in
your entire life
but if you'd like to make it even finer
we call it gilding the lily
you can do that and all you need is a
cup of glass I take your jealous of
style and a canteen Joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah yeah
I know I know there's a whole bunch of
people who can't stand
um
sipping or eating noises it's a pretty
big deal like if you have that it's like
a big deal in your life and I was just
seeing somebody in locals who who says
they they mute that part
and
and uh maybe you should too so get your
finger on the mute button if you don't
like to hear that sort of thing which is
perfectly reasonable
all right
um news about me
I believe my manic phase has ended
I'm not positive but I think I asked
because I slept so well last night
so I had uh like a good almost three
days of a manic phase and oh my God
those are enjoyable it's not enjoyable
for you necessarily
if you have to observe me it's not
necessarily a good day for you
but it's really good for me really
creative and I get a lot done it feels
good I got Infinite Energy
but it doesn't last long two three days
I'm done now
here's a little uh lesson for you on
success
I'm going to give you one of the most
useful things I've ever taught anybody
and this is in one of my books
people some people are simplifier
simplifiers
and summer optimizers
a simplifier will say yes I know it
would be a good idea to do this and this
and this but it would be so complicated
that will make everything break so
instead I'm just going to do the the
simple thing that I know will work every
time and I will give up you know maybe
50 of my revenue or whatever because I
know I just want it to work
an Optimizer will say well wait a minute
are you telling me that if I just do
these other steps I can get another 10
of goodness you know maybe profit or
whatever whatever you're looking for
and
I would like to submit the simplifiers
be optimizers
now not every time optimizers work the
optimizing Works often enough that it
becomes addicting and you'll think oh
that one time I optimized and it worked
great I better do that every time
because it was such a good hit when that
worked my dopamine felt good so you can
get addicted to optimizing even though
it's the worst strategy
all right here is your perfect example
for maybe two years
my followers here on Livestream
have been asking as a reason to ask to
live stream on Rumble at the same time
I'm doing YouTube and and locals
and I looked into it and I realized that
I couldn't I couldn't do it in a simple
way the simple way would be add another
device because I had separate devices
for the two platforms and just call it
up just like the other two now that
would have been more complicated than
having two
but in all cases it's just putting on a
title and saying go
but Rumble has this uh doesn't do a
direct live stream like that yet you
have to go through stream yard
and I've been telling all of you
everybody who asked me to do the rumble
do you remember what I said for two
years
if you had a little bit of complexity uh
just a little bit
the entire live stream will fall apart
and I know that seems impossible to
believe because it looks like you know I
just turned it on and I go right
but I promise you I have lots of
experience in this domain of adding
complexity to a simple thing it breaks
it every time
so the only way I could get past the why
don't you use Rumble is I had to do it
right in front of you I had to show you
that that that that little extra
complexity
makes the whole thing Fall Apart
so this is the third day in a row
in which I completely know how to do it
all right the problem is not the
learning curve I absolutely know how to
do this three days in a row it's failed
because a little extra complexity
is all it takes now what is a little
extra complexity
the adding the rumbles step added
approximately
35 steps
would would you have anticipated that
now it's about 35 steps and I have to
get them all right
and on time
so the first thing that that did to me
is it made my my wonderful morning
um routine
I love the morning
I love being up at you know 4 a.m
Nobody's around I'm just doing my
business getting everything done is a
wonderful time
making adding those 35 steps for rumble
ruined my morning
so do you think I would do as much work
on your behalf if I hate it
as I do when I love it which is the case
every other day of course not no of
course not you would eventually talk
yourself out of doing it you'd find
something else to do that doesn't bother
you right
so
so I added about 35 extra steps now what
are those steps
one of those steps is I have to go get
my laptop
because I'm using it for other things
during the day my other things are just
in place all the time then I've got to
get the power cord
then I've got to clear out my my
programs that are on there so they're
not interfering I gotta I've got to find
my microphone because it's not connected
all the time I've got a I've got to
rewire everything I've got to open two
different apps and then I've got to fill
in I don't know maybe 25 fields
probably 25 Fields I haven't counted
them something like that now I also
tested it before I went live
so I've now tested going live on rumbles
on Rumble to make sure that I know how
the software works
three times two or three times
so I definitely know how to do it every
time I've tested did it worked but every
time I've gone live it didn't
do you know why
complexity yeah this was a hundred
percent predictable
but it wasn't obvious to you so I did
this for you basically mostly mostly the
people and locals were asking me to do
it I knew it was going to be a lot of
work and it was and I knew that the
complexity would make the entire
operation crumble which it did because
it ruined my show three days in a row so
this is the last day I'm going to try
Rumble and and
just so you know full disclosure I own
stock in Rumble I'm a stockholder I want
Rumble to be the main thing you look at
but it doesn't work for live streaming
unless and let me give you the caveat
if I had a full-time engineer
it would work
because the engineer would just have it
set up I would just show up and do my
show
to go from my current operation
where I wake up happy every day
and do stuff I love
the whole time
as soon as I add a second person how
much am I going to enjoy that
can't do it it would take all of my
focus away in the morning because the
engineer I'd be like preparing my
content and what would the engineer do
send me a message to tell me there was
something different
and then I would be interrupted
and that'd be all right all right and
I'll try to get back to work
and then the engineer would say all
right we're ready and I'd be like
okay you interrupted me again
and now I don't know where I was I have
to go back to that right so you can't
really add an engineer unless you're
adding like a whole Network show
uh so if you do it like the daily wire
you know they have a whole operation
that makes total sense right because
they're going for a big Market they're
going for bigger money they can afford
that that makes sense you you the
complexity makes sense in that sense but
there's this whole Middle Ground where
it doesn't make any sense at all and
that's sort of where I'm at
now
to that same point CNN how to actually
uh pretty useful uh article about
attention spans shrinking
have you noticed that
yeah
um to your point when somebody says
sticks and Hammer does a rumble
I too could do Rumble quite easily if it
were my only platform
does that make sense it's only the
adding it to what I'm doing it gets to
the the crumble point if the only thing
I did was one show I think actually the
software would work if there were only
one things roaming screaming yeah and
the I think Viva might have a uh an
engineer
is that the case
do you know if he has anybody helping
him because if he doesn't have an
engineer
I will guarantee he does not how many
times has it not work
have you seen him have uh technical
difficulties during his show
I think I have
I think I have seen it not work and I
don't watch it that often yeah he hasn't
he often he has problems right and it
totally detracts from the flow yeah he
has problems all the time sure
all right
so apparently it's a real thing our
attention spans have been shrinking
there's a some book on it CNN was
talking about it and uh
so in 2004
people's average attention to a screen
if they were looking at one they'd look
at it for two and a half minutes
but today that's down to 75 seconds
so you can actually measure the
difference in how much we can look at
one thing and be happy
uh oh it's now it's down to 47 seconds
I'm sorry it's actually all the way down
to 47 seconds
and here's the hard part
if you get distracted
it takes 25 minutes to refocus on your
task do you believe that
do you believe that if you're working
away happily and you get distracted it
takes 25 minutes to do your task
here's the explanation
because let's say you're doing your task
you're working at home
and then the dog needs to be fed
so you say to yourself I'll feed the dog
then I'll go back to my task five
minutes right most five minutes
right so you go feed the dog
and while you're feeding the dog you
realize that
there's might be a package at the door
they haven't checked so you checked the
door and there is a package
and so you bring it in
and then you think oh I gotta open this
package I'll be thinking about it so
what happens is it's not that you do a
thing and go back that would only take
you a few minutes what you do is you do
a thing that makes you do a thing that
makes you do a thing
and that that sort of Modern Life
everything leads to another thing you're
getting a lot done it's just you can't
concentrate on your one thing
so it's a gigantic problem and
um yeah there's some suggesting that
there's something you do about it but
I'm not sure I'm not sure you can do
anything about it I think we just
permanently rewired ourselves to be
unable to concentrate
now back to my earlier topic the thing
that was so special about being in my
manic phase is that that went away
during my few days of mania or hype I
think it's actually uh
hypomania
I think I was using technically a
slightly wrong word it's like hypomania
so you get the good stuff without much
of the bad stuff and
during that period I could concentrate
as much as I wanted
and it was unbelievable
like it was like being a different
person for a while well I guess I was
now I'm gonna tie this to you yet
another topic
if the problem in the modern world is we
can't concentrate when there are any
distractions
doesn't that mean that if you went to
Starbucks or a cafe and or like people
wandering around everybody's talking and
 that that would be the hardest
place to work
common sense right
your common sense says if distractions
are a problem you need to go where
they're the fewest distractions that's
where you'll be best common sense
do you know Common Sense is just magical
thinking
common sense is whatever you decided was
true
and then you reason backwards to why it
was totally common sense right common
sense is completely magical thinking
nobody has Common Sense except for the
the simplest the simplest decisions
right we all get those right but as soon
as there's any complexity you know
anything that's judgmental anything that
hasn't been fully settled for millennium
common sense is is an absurd subjective
experience which you convince yourself
is a rational experience it's just it's
purely an illusion that happens in your
mind that you have common sense now you
do have it for simple stuff that that's
why it's so easy to to fool yourself you
do have it for really easy stuff only
um
so
but in fact if you the studies show it
and my experience shows that if I go to
Starbucks and it's busy and there's all
kinds of stuff happen that's the place I
can concentrate the best
I don't know why exactly I'll give you
my best guess
the guess is when there are lots of
distractions
there are no distractions
there's some amount of distraction where
the distraction becomes the background
and then the background just becomes
static it's like white noise you know
everybody talking equals nobody talking
right now would your would your common
sense have ever been able to get to that
point
would you have been been able to use
your common sense to think your way from
oh there are too many distractions so
the way I'll solve it is to quadruple
the number of distractions
your common sense doesn't get you there
at all so don't trust your common sense
and sometimes you just have to test it
all right
um
let me give you the best the best
explanation I can give
as to why the people on Twitter
think I'm an entirely different person
than the people who watch me on live
stream and the people who know me in
person
and I think it's this one mistake that
they make
and let me let me explain it this way
if I wrote a blog post you know a Long
blog post where I did a lot a long video
in which I said uh my car's electrical
systems are terrible they're always
which is true I have a BMW
and all of my BMWs have always been
Christmas trees meaning the the front
panel is lit up basically all the time
um maybe 90 of the time I've ever owned
a BMW I've owned several models probably
90 of the time there's a warning light
that's on
now I consider that
you know sub-optimal customer experience
now suppose I wrote a blog post or I did
a video and that's the only thing I
talked about
the only thing I talked about was damn
these things have terrible
or let's say sub-optimal user experience
because all the errors that are always
there what what would you conclude about
my opinion if the only thing I talked
about was what was wrong with it
you would reasonably assume
that I had all this time
that I could have said that there's
something good about it too right
wouldn't it be reasonable if I left out
anything good
a reasonable person could say okay you
talk for half an hour and you didn't
mention anything good about the car
clearly you don't like the car would
that be a reasonable assumption
yeah it might not be true
but that would be a very reasonable
assumption all right now let's say I
send a tweet
it's the only thing you see
and my tweet says
damn I the electrical I always have a
let's say a warning light on my car by
BMW
that's the only thing I tweet
and then maybe maybe uh a year later I
tweet you know why are the cars why are
the tires so expensive
on my model car
and then later I say I love my car
then what do the uh what do the uh uh
the clop birds do
if I say I love my car they say do you
let's check your Twitter feeds
um you said two things about your car
one the tires are expensive two there's
always a warning light on
so where where's the Tweet about how
good your car is where's the Tweet about
how you love the sound of the engine
where's the Tweet about how you only
have to think about where you want the
car and it will be there where's the
part about how the steering is really
good where's the part about how the the
sound system is excellent where's the
part about how when you close the door
it's a nice solid feel where's the part
about out when people look at it they
say oh looks like you know how to pick a
good car
where's all that
and the clot birds will say oh you lion
clot bird you
you've clearly been saying this is a
terrible car and now you're
flip-flopping or are you on the fence
are you on the fence or are you
flip-flopping
so here's my advice to you
Twitter is not where you add context
if you see a tweet you should judge the
tweet in isolation
right
if I say Joy Behar uh has a good fashion
sense
what should you conclude on that if
that's my tweet that's the only thing
I've ever said about Joy Behar she has a
good fashion sense
should you conclude
as a Smart Twitter user that therefore
I'd like to have sex with her and also
her political opinions are gold
because that's what the club Birds would
say the clock Birds would say you're
only ever complimenting Joy Behar
so I think that makes you a Democrat
right
so if you have any if you have any
confusion about why the Twitter people
think I'm literally a different person
is because they believe the missing part
is the important part
think about that
on Twitter the clock Birds believe the
part I don't say is actually the
important part
it doesn't work like that on Twitter the
tween is just about the thing that's the
only thing you can conclude
but if I do long form and I leave out
with something that obviously I have
plenty of time to put in there it
probably does mean something
so there's your uh explanation of how to
interpret
my Twitter personality which is entirely
different from my long-form personality
do you accept that
yeah yeah if if you're only see me on
Twitter I'm a flip-flopping backpedaling
uh indecisive guy
yeah okay well now we've explained it
don't have to wonder about that anymore
that's way too much about me
but sometimes you have to do it all
right uh Rasmussen uh asked what people
thought about the whole Matt Gates of
his band of Rogues holding up Congress
and the the speakership and I was kind
of curious about this but interestingly
39 of Voters say
um McCarthy was more to blame for the
delay
and about the same number exactly the
same uh 39 believe that uh you know Matt
Gates and the opponents to McCarthy were
the blade what do you conclude from the
fact that there are equal number of
people who think McCarthy was to blame
versus Matt Gates give me your
interpretation
and that means what
yeah
I'll give you my interpretation
there you go yeah Maggie is one that
gate Matt Gates won as hard as you can
win
right because here's what I expected
if nothing good had come from this Matt
Gates would just look like an idiot am I
right
if the public you know hadn't
appreciated on some level that they were
pushing
he would have lost I mean he rolled the
dice
sometimes you need people who have
nothing to lose they're they're very
valuable
there's probably nothing more valuable
to The Republic than somebody who has
nothing to lose so his political
fortunes were were you know well stunted
but he's back
you know he became uh much more of a
national name and he's now branded more
for this at the moment than his his
other his other uh actions of the past
what do we have this is like the most
the cleanest
smartest win in politics you might see
this year
all right here's another story
apparently the ex-cto of the Trump
organization
has been convicted of his tax uh tax
related crimes apparently he was
receiving money in a variety of ways
that he had control over because he was
the CTO
which allowed him to avoid taxes until
he got caught
one of those things was he paid a fake
check to his wife so she could get a
Social Security
that's pretty much a crime
yeah I I pay social security I'd like
everybody to get it who deserves it and
nobody who doesn't
but uh
somehow none of this affected you know
Trump family
the this this crime apparently was very
isolated to an individual his own
benefit it wasn't the Trump company
benefit at all uh indeed he defrauded uh
the Trump organizations
am I wrong about that
this is an interpretation of mine but if
what he was doing was taking money from
the Trump organization
and treating treating it like it wasn't
compensation that's what he got busted
for
so he didn't have to pay for it because
it was treated as not compensation
but did the Trump organization get it
get to write it off
I'm not sure they got the same write-off
because that's why you don't pay people
in cash
the reason the employer doesn't want to
pay cash sometimes is because they don't
get the write-off it's just money that
disappeared so I don't know how they
handled it they might have taken a write
off anyway in a different way
but uh this is all a long way to get to
the punch line of the story
uh does anybody know the last name of
the CTO who apparently did some sketchy
things with taxes
what's his last name
in the simulation what would this
simulation name somebody like that
uh Libby check his last name is uh
weaselberg
weaselberg
that's a real thing
that's his actual name weaselberg
now I think it sounds racist
you know that maybe that's why it's
funny
so we'll we'll call that out we'll call
that out as you know it may be that it's
like vaguely racist which is why it's
funny but it's the weasel part that's so
funny
like if you have a weasel right in your
name
let me just give you some advice
if you're looking to hire somebody who
will be in charge of your money
hey I'd like to hire you to be in charge
of my money
um don't hire anybody who has a name
like weasel or a thief or a
mixed stealer yeah well we'll take it
let's take it into a uh more diverse
domain if his last name is Mac theft
yeah just think twice
uh we got a new CTO his name is uh Bob
Mac theft
think twice think twice
all right well the FAA computers were
down which grounded most of the domestic
flights
are they back do you have an update yet
the flights were supposed to be back
online like right now but I doubt it oh
yes they're actually back up okay so it
wasn't it wasn't the most critical
system there was some kind of a
notification system that was down but it
was important enough because you have to
have your notifications if there's any
problems or danger
um the thought was that it was not uh
cyber crime nobody hacked them and do
you know
um on what basis
the White House's spokesperson said it
was uh not a cybercrime do you know what
evidence was presented
to suggest it was not not a hacking
problem
oh none
not
but don't worry about it now my guess is
it probably wasn't a hacking situation
but it could have been
I I don't think you could know in the in
the fog of War like when it first
happens in the first few hours do you
think the White House knows what the
problem is I doubt the fefa even knows
the problem yet so how can you you know
rule something out
uh but here's my the funniest take of
course Pete bootage
being the Secretary of Transportation
he's you know on the hot seat now let me
ask you this
when you first heard the Buddha judge
would be the Secretary of Transportation
did you not say to yourself
well there's a sleepy job where he'll be
forgotten and nothing important is ever
going to happen
I kind of thought we would never hear
from them again
but it turns out that maybe maybe the
Democrats knew how to end his political
career it's like this guy's getting a
little he's getting a little too much
attention let's put him in the
Department of Transportation because I
think we got some problems coming that
Department of Transportation has a big
problems coming we better put Pete there
and see what he can do now what in the
world can Pete butterjudge actually do
about the faa's computer problems
will he make a statement I'm just going
to guess
I think he's going to make a statement
saying it's very important that things
work properly yes yes that feels Fair he
says they should work properly and we're
going to do everything we can
pretty generic to make sure this never
happens again and we'll make sure that
whoever is responsible is held to
account
so problem solved
Pete bootage Edge is going to say some
words on television
do you think he's going to just get in
there and start programming yeah I found
it and I got it I got the problem
or do you think he's going to say a
bunch of statements on TV that will
cause the person who is trying to fix
the problem ah I think I found that bug
to get distracted
and if Pete Buddha judge distracts the
person the people trying to solve the
problem how long does it take him to get
back to the problem
25 minutes according to CNN 25 minutes
so
I think it's hilarious he's going to get
the blame and there's absolutely nothing
he can do to fix it
except stay say stuff on TV
but he's good at saying stuff on TV so
at least he's got that going for him
all right you all want to talk about
those uh classified government documents
that were found in Biden's office at the
University of Pennsylvania where he had
an office
to do some
important sounding things we don't know
if he ever showed up to their office
that was between his vice presidency and
his presidency
for several years and we know that as
soon as that office started the Biden
blah blah blah office that uh China
donated a whole bunch of money to the
college and some of that money may have
gone to fund his million dollars a year
pay for doing who knows what
so
it appears that we have untangled we the
the right-leaning press and those of us
watching uh have untangled how the
pretty much how the bidens profit from
China and profit from their their
positions
and it looks obvious to me am I missing
something
is it not obvious that
Biden was
um being used as an attractor for
Chinese funding and why in the world was
China funding the University of
Pennsylvania as anything
well maybe we should start there
why in the world
why in the world was China funding
anything at the University of
Pennsylvania
anything
anything at all just anything
why is that okay
well I said okay that should be so not
okay
then we heard the story if you're
watching Tucker Carlson last night it
was another Master Class you know every
once in a while there'll be a a news
topic where only Tucker Carlson can do
it right
have you noticed that
have you had that experience yet yeah
there are some things that only Tucker
can do right right and he just
it was just a master class yesterday
just the way he was tying everything
together
it was very entertaining very
informative
it's about his it's about as good as you
could do anything on television honestly
he is so at the top of his game it's
just fun to watch even if you disagree
with him you'd have to agree that his
you know his work right now is just
crazy good a lot of topics
um but one of the things you mentioned
which I hadn't heard is that there was
we now know that a professor at
University of Pennsylvania
well contacted I guess Biden's
granddaughter
who is attending there suspiciously
everybody in the Biden family is smart
enough to get into a Ivy League school
because he's associated with it you know
no big surprise there
um but she was offered from China
to have an expense paid business class
trip Hotel paid for come to China and
attend some seminar and the professor
said directly you said it directly you
know it's because of your family
connection
and this is the way China does business
and it's just right there it's like
right in front of you
what what possible benefit could Biden's
granddaughter have to China
like what China is really like oh we'll
never we'll never be able to handle our
demographic collapse unless we hear from
Biden's granddaughter
who's still in college
so you've got this money flow that
clearly ended up in Biden's pocket
indirectly from China to the University
of Pennsylvania to Biden and then you've
got the flow directly to his
granddaughter I don't remember if she
said yes or no but you know it was there
uh yeah the think tank the think tank so
I guess it was a think tank at the
University of Pennsylvania
but really it was a fundraising
mechanism it looks like
yeah it's just cultural differences yes
it's just a cultural difference the
Chinese just like
to talk to people who are connected to
people just a cultural difference
so every part of that looks funny but
the funniest part is watching the
Democrats explain why Biden's classified
documents
were completely different
than Trump's
have you ever heard me say that
analogies
never work
for winning an argument
and so we have this natural analogy so
people's brains are just obviously going
to compare it to the Trump Mar-A-Lago
documents can't help it is that a fair
comparison
well yes if you know how to use an
analogy and know if you don't
here would be the proper way to use an
analogy oh there are some important
parts of both of these stories that are
similar
the wrong way the wrong way to use an
analogy is the way the Democrats are
doing it
this is so different
are you kidding me I can't believe the
Republicans are trying to make this to
try to make political hey out of this
these stories are so different for
example one of them happened to Biden
and one of them happened to Trump I mean
how could you call that the same what
you think Biden and Trump are the same
person just listen to Joy Behar Joy
Behar explains it this way
since we know that Joe Biden is uh
honest and not a thief uh as opposed to
what you know about Trump she would say
then you can know that Biden's
explanation of why they were there and
that it was probably an accident must be
true because you start with a conclusion
that a person is honest and he doesn't
he doesn't lie there's no evidence of
Biden lying apparently according to Joy
Behar no evidence at all that he's a
liar
um but also no evidence of theft at
least in a you know mugging you with a
gun kind of way
and so since we know that Biden is this
good person but we know by contrast the
orange man bad
people how can you compare
the best man you've ever heard of Joe
Biden with his honesty how do you
compare that to Orange man bad I mean
that's that's like nine day nine day
and so
the Democrats have literally
they're literally selling to their
public
that they can start with the conclusion
that he's honest and use that to reason
backwards to the crime didn't happen
I'm not making that up
you check for yourself
Joy Behar said that on TV if you're
starting with an honest person you can
reason backwards to know the crime
didn't happen
do you know who was honest until he
wasn't
Alan wieselberg
until he was uh accused and convicted of
cheating on tax related stuff
he had no criminal record
as far as anybody knew
he was he was the honest guy I'd never
stole anything
until he didn't
so why don't the Democrats use their
same logic
he hadn't done any crimes and for 74
years or whatever therefore if you think
he did a crime you can reason backwards
to prove he didn't
because he's not a criminal
how could he do a crime if you're not a
criminal
duh
now
uh so see you then everybody else is
trying hard to explain this is
completely different now they I'm using
an exaggerated example but the the
differences that they say
are completely ridiculous
sometimes they're talking about the
contents
and their thinking is completely
different because there were different
contents
you don't know what the contents are of
either one
you probably never will
how do you know the contents were
different those two things we'll never
know the contents how about uh when uh
when Trump's uh documents were
discovered uh the the Democrats were
saying it's going to risk these sources
and methods and my God it could be
nuclear secrets
and that's totally different than the
unknown documents that happen to be
about three countries that are the most
sensitive in our world
so am I wrong that watching the
Democrats try to respond to this is
hilarious
I'm not wrong right
it is literally hilarious watching them
spin
it's really fun
uh now let's see what else is happening
um here are some things that uh CNN said
so Stefan Collinson you might know him
he's a he's the major anti-trump guy
back when CNN was more more directly
biased
um and I I'll give to CNN some credit
they've definitely made a shift but
they've got some work to do they're
moving in the right direction toward the
middle but some work to do
and here's how Stephen collinson's uh
said it quote Republicans are dot dot
dot because I'm leaving out an
unimportant part of the sentence
Republicans are not belatedly voicing
concerns why are they belatedly voice
and concerns what what makes the
Republicans voicing of the concerns
belated
what what would you Intuit from that
I would Intuit from that that they've
known about it for a long time
and they didn't think it was important
to now so now they're bringing it up
because they're going to make some
political hey out of it right
no the reason it's belated
is because
Biden hid it from the public until now
because he wanted to hide it until the
midterms were over
didn't they hide it until the midterms
were over by the way give me a fact
check on that I don't want to be wrong
on that it's being reported that they
hit it they knew it and they concealed
it until after the midterms
amazing
amazing all right
so the belated is a propaganda word uh
there was nothing belated about what the
Republicans did the Republicans pounced
so so if you're uh on the left whatever
the Democrats do is either a pounce or
is belated there's there's no such thing
as Republicans doing something in the
right time and appropriate way it's
either pouncing or belated
I was pouncing I was pouncing I was
pouncing no it's belated
too late too late
yeah I know you tried to transition from
pouncing into just right but you didn't
make it you didn't make it no you went
all the way to belated sorry credibility
gone
all right what else I love you looking
at the word choice because that's where
all the that's where all the the bias
comes out
and then this this game
um according to available evidence so
far
now when did a CNN opinion person ever
say according to the evidence so far
only with Biden
do you think they've ever used that
phrase talking about Trump you know
maybe they have but I would imagine it's
less often right
maybe with Trump they'd say what if
with Trump they wouldn't say available
evidence so far
they would say it might be nuclear
it might be sources and methods we may
have compromised the entire intelligence
operation of the United States we may
have surrendered to Russia
that's the way they would handle it
but within Biden it's like well
available evidence so far I mean so far
so far Alan wieselberg has never done a
thing
um
and then the next part of the same
sentence according to available evidence
so far comma Biden appears to be giving
it to Americans straight
as he promised to do on the campaign
Trail
did he promise to give it to Americans
straight on the campaign Trail
before or after he used the fine people
hoax as his main Campaign theme
literally Biden ran on the most
well-known lie in American politics now
well known by let's say half of the
country no well documented I mean
there's no question about it it's a lie
he literally read his campaign on a lie
and he still says that Trump suggested
drinking bleach
a lie and he didn't he didn't say any
other kind of uh disinfectant except
light
now
this is hilarious to me all right uh
but yet so Stephen Collinson wants to
soften this he does he doesn't want to
look like some kind of a pro-biden
completely in the tank kind of guy well
you know his bosses have told him to
like play play A Strain so he softens
that he says yet that does not mean we
shouldn't have to consider questions
about how the documents came to be in
that office
listen to the sentence yet that does not
mean we shouldn't
when when do you ever write a sentence
like that it does not mean we shouldn't
wouldn't another way to write that
sentence uh Joshua lisac wouldn't a
better way to say
there's a good reason to do this
shouldn't you say we'd better look into
this
there's certainly a strong signal that
says we should research it
why would you not use a direct sentence
do you know when people don't use direct
sentences
is when they're trying to decrease your
reading comprehension literally
literally this is a sentence is written
to decrease your ability to understand
it it's written as a double negative if
he wanted you to understand that he
would say it's important we look into it
how hard would that be
how hard is it said to say you know we
don't think there's anything there I
mean that's an opinion right a
reasonable opinion would be there's no
evidence of anything bad
uh true true and then but it's important
we look into it
by the time you're done with this double
negative you're not even sure what what
he was talking about
um
Sprint let's see what else uh
let's say
special counsel or these talks about
Trump as the uh as the comparison
and uh also the uh the Democrats are
complaining
that the Republicans are are going to
take advantage of this for political
purposes
can you imagine that oh okay we all
share some disgust
that the Republicans would really
you you would try to take advantage
of the fact that the guy who's been
blaming you for a jailable crime was
committing the crime as he was accusing
you oh and you're going to make that a
thing but suddenly suddenly that's
important oh oh belatedly
so belatedly
now suddenly it's important if you've
got top secret government documents in
your office oh yeah oh yeah suddenly
that's important
you can't you can't even describe the
Democrat position on this without making
a face like you're an idiot
like I could try watch
I'm going to try to try to describe the
uh the Democrat view I'm going to try to
keep a straight face and see how long I
could maintain it hold on hold on
okay let me try
and we can see that the the documents in
the University of Penn uh the bind had
there uh we can see that there's a
completely different very different case
than the Trump documents because it's
drum documents seem to seem to have like
top secret
information
but
whoa completely different uh I couldn't
do it I couldn't do it
all right so I was watching uh CNN
failing on this topic uh and a hilarious
thing I don't know the name of the
correspondent but if you saw Anderson
Cooper talking to one of their CNN
correspondents about this topic
uh you can see
Anderson Cooper understanding what his
employer wanted him to do
which is not overly politicize it and I
thought during the during the brief clip
I watched I thought he did
I thought he actually was
trying to cover it as a story which has
facts and then we'll just give you the
facts but his correspondent did the the
uh the Trump face
do you know what the Trump face is it's
when it's when a CNN or an MSNBC person
talks about Trump and they do the face
and I'll just make this one up but it's
like you know if you're not doing the
face you'd say and uh and president
Trump had very similar you know
situations with his documents
but here here's the uh the CNN face or
the MSNBC face about Trump like and a
lot of people are saying
Trump had a similar situation but it's
obvious it's very different it's very
different
right what do you see the CNN face the
MSNBC space
that is either I can't I'm not sure how
to interpret it because I can't tell if
they believe what they're saying because
this is a trigger for cognitive distance
so in theory they should be just
operating in cognitive dissonance and
don't know that they're being ridiculous
I think maybe they don't know
but other times they must know they're
lying don't you think
it does look like they should know
they're lying meaning saying that the
comparison is inappropriate it's a very
appropriate comparison
no I don't think you should treat one
the same just because there's some
similarities they have to still be
treated individually but the comparison
is fair you know it's a fair comparison
um
and I actually thought Anderson Cooper
was feeling uncomfortable but that's
probably just me reading it into it
because because
here's something I like to say often
Anderson Cooper is very smart
as our you know I would guess most of
the people on CNN
um
so he must have known as he was
listening to the correspondent I feel
like he knew the same as I did because
it was obvious that Anderson was trying
to do his actual job as his employer
wants him to do it which give give us
the facts whereas his correspondent was
clearly still on the orange man bad
Channel like it's like she hadn't got
the memo from from Chris light licked
light I don't know how to say his name
uh the the new boss and and I felt like
Anderson was probably thinking again
this is just my mind yeah I don't know
what Anderson Cooper's thinking of
course but in my mind it looked like he
was being uncomfortable because like did
you not get the memo we're not supposed
to act like that anymore it's not all
about orange man bad anymore sometimes
we can just tell the news
so I'll make a distinction between uh
Anderson Cooper who appeared to be
playing the way you would want him to
and his correspondent whose name I can't
remember
um
so the Republicans now that they've got
control of the house and they've got
their own speaker and everything they're
starting this big committee to
investigate the quote weaponization of
the government
of course it was approved on a straight
party line concept and they're going to
look into
Biden Administration efforts they say to
influence well it's pretty well
documented to influence content on
social media platforms
now
what do you think of that
what is your impression of the let's
talk first about The Branding of it what
do you think of The Branding of it as
quote weaponization of the government
does that sound right
does it does that sound like
that's the proper way to frame it
no no no if you think that's right
you're just you're just being political
that is so now right
[Laughter]
what did I just get done telling you
I just got done telling you that the
left was starting with the conclusion
they're starting with the conclusion
that Joe Biden is honest therefore
everything he did must have been
appropriate
the the Republicans are trying the same
play the Republicans are saying
weaponization of the government and
they're going to make you think that
that's a fact
and then they're going to work backwards
to prove it happens
all right I'll tell you what did happen
for sure
for sure there were Democrats who took
advantage of the fact that they could
work with Private Industry and get a
good result
that seems to be a fact would you agree
there there is a pattern
of Democrats working with Private
Industry
in a way that from the outside it looks
like too much pressure and inappropriate
for you know our Constitution and our
system that seems true so I think that
the things that they're looking for will
definitely be there
but do you think that
weaponization of the government
is a fair and balanced way to describe
what they're doing
you know now I do I do get I do get that
they're trying to lump several things
together right so for example if you use
the IRS to go after your enemies I guess
Obama did right that that's the
reporting uh that would be a
weaponization of government
so if you were to take the IRS example
and add it to let's say the uh what do
you call it the
Patriot Act where they're spying on
people
that looks like weaponization if you
look at the uh
defined people hoax that does look like
a collusion between the Democrats and
the the media that looks like
weaponization
if you look at um
uh all the other hoaxes those are the
weaponization uh if you look at the
the the laptop scheme you know saying
that the laptop was that that looks like
weaponization
so we do have a bunch of examples which
absolutely fit that label right
there's no shortage of
well-documented examples that you could
put in that category
I just have an objection
with with calling it The weaponization
of government
even though it is
because it's a little bit conclusiony
right it's a little bit conclusiony
um that's a little a little too far for
me and let me
uh now now do you see do you see how
if I tweeted my opinion on this it would
be taken wrong
right if I tweeted this all I would say
is
that seems like you're starting with a
conclusion
right it would look like I disagreed
with having an investigation no
now I disagree with that
so on Twitter they'll think that I'm uh
I'm attacking Republicans
but if they see the live stream they'll
say oh I say you're totally on board
with this investigation I am totally on
board but maybe the way they framed it
is a little more political
that's all
just be aware of it
um
Thomas Massey spoke to this uh bill
and use the word transparency
that's what I want to say yeah he
described this as increasing
transparency because the public
absolutely needs to know we absolutely
need to know what happened if you're
already concluding it was weaponization
of the government you've gone a little
too far too soon for me just a personal
preference
uh but yes
when you see Thomas Massey speak
he says rational things
that do not seem to be intended for
anything except helping the country
now he go he went further and he said
make sure you put some serious Democrats
on the investigation he said they exist
I've worked with them we've we've got
legislation together through so get some
Democrats on the thing
now when he says that do you think he
means it or is that just a political
thing what do you think
can't read his mind nobody can read
anybody's mind but everything he is
every action so far
suggests he means it
because he approaches it like an
engineer right an engineer just looks at
the the engine and says okay this part
this part needs to be replaced
the politician looks at it and says oh
this part's good this past bad
because this this part agrees with me
and this part doesn't like but he's just
looking at the engines and he's saying
this engine requires
some oil in the in the form of
transparency
and if you're going to add that oil
the wrong way to do it is bipartisan
the right way to do it is with I'm sorry
the the right way to do it is bipartisan
so do it the way the machine needs it
done right if you look at the government
as a machine
he's just saying this part's broken
here's the oil to fix it you know the
transparency so of course we need it but
the transparency won't be effective
unless you put some serious Democrats on
the committee
now
you tell me
what politician has said something
smarter or more useful than that
lately
like nothing but like that's just the
most practical smart
clean narrative and I'll say
everything's a narrative but some of
them are clean meaning there is not
overly politicized that was what I want
to say right that I want him to be my
president
like just based on that not just on that
of course but that's what I want to say
now anything else is that the very words
expressed by those opposed to the
correct the creation of this select
committee
um
on the weaponization of the federal
government demonstrate the dire need for
it so in other words the people arguing
that you should not have more
transparency
that's all you need
that's the whole argument wait a minute
wait a minute
are you telling me that the Republicans
want transparency
and the Democrats will say no if you get
that transparency you can imagine all
the problems all the problems see the
face
I can't even do it without the face
you have to do the face to say things
ridiculous it's like oh I don't want any
transparency happening
how do you even argue against
transparency in public
and I love the fact that Massey calls
them out if you're arguing against
transparency
we really need some transparency
like that is a good point they proved
they proved this point
which brings me to my related topic of
useless people
I need you to give me a bias check okay
I think there's something going on a
pattern
but I could be completely in
confirmation biased territory if there's
one thing I can teach you
that I'll try to stay consistent to is
if you're having confirmation bias or
cognitive dissonance you're the only one
who doesn't know what's happening
so if it's happening to me right now
I'm the only one who doesn't know it
right or you you should be able to Spot
It so I'm going to tell you what I think
is true
that even I think is
oh
like I it's even sketchy in my own mind
why I think this is true all right so
here's my bias and you tell me
the people that the Democrats put
forward as their spokespeople
are different in in a very important way
than the people the Republicans put
forward
okay
for example Democrats put Adam Schiff
um swalwell
on the entertainment side you would see
your joy behars
right so those are the credit voices
that seem to get elevated and left now
what voices on the right
Tom Cotton
serious smart guy
Thomas Bassey
the most reasonable person who's ever
held office in my opinion
um
see DeSantis
one of the strongest Mike Lee
reasonable
strong in every way
right
now I know some of you have like some
Tom Cotton issues because he voted for
something that you couldn't avoid
uh I don't know what was he supposed to
do didn't matter but
um
but you tell me
that there's not a a difference there
now I have a theory for why there's a
difference
you want to hear it do you have a theory
like an actual Theory
of how we got here that you could say
yes or no to
all right
here's my hypothesis not a theory it's a
hypothesis
the hypothesis is
that because the Democrats controlled
all the canceling
all the clowns on the right got canceled
if there were more clowns on the right
you would see them more
but they got canceled
if the counseling had worked in the
other way Schiff and swallow would have
been canceled
am I right
the crazy people on the left have been
free to run run around and get attention
and the News will always focus on who
the news will always go for the crazy
people
but
I'll just give you one example now if
you will allow me
I'm using the phrase crazy people
as a sort of a a proximate stand-in for
credibility will you accept that the way
I say the crazy people in the Clowns I'm
really talking about credibility mostly
to the other side because I think the
Democrats believe Schiff and swallow
right it's just you look like a clown to
the other side
so
imagine if you will that Alex Jones had
never been canceled
and that every time there was a national
story
the Press put Alex Jones on for his
comments and he was still exactly Alex
Jones
nothing's different right
right I'm not trying to insult Alex
Jones I'm just saying as a as a point of
objective truth
he's considered non-credible by half of
the country at least right
so on the dev on the Republican side
they never have to deal with that
because they've already been canceled
so so if if Fox News is looking for
somebody to put on for a comment
they can't even find a Joy Behar
canceled
all they can find is like a serious
Senator or a serious member of Congress
it's all they got so they have to now
what do you think of the hypothesis that
the that the canceling worked against
the Democrats in a very non-obvious way
what do you think
yeah I think I think there's something
to it it's not the whole story but
there's definitely something to it
and I think we need some kind of new
name for the useless people
because useless is you know sort of not
fun
um
and also that worse than Watergate guy
yeah Bernstein now the worse than
Watergate guy is is literally just the
clown isn't he
not literally but you know what I mean
but if you bring the worse than
Watergate guy on just to say it's worse
than Watergate which is all he's done
for years that's all he does
how do you take that seriously
now let me ask you what does the right
do when they have somebody who's like
that
what does Fox News do if there's
somebody in their universe
who's sort of the Carl Bernstein
they move them to a show on Fox Nation
I'm not going to name names but they put
their least credible people in into the
uh what he called the minor leagues
they put them in the minor leagues
and they still have a show in an
audience and people are happy right
people watch the show are happy
but but they do take it off of the main
the main Enterprise
there's a difference all right there's a
story that the left wants a ban gas
stoves uh apparently based on no data
whatsoever but they're not Banning
existing ones they would ban sale of new
ones but I can't in my I just can't
imagine this will happen
can you now they say it's because
um
there's a you know ventilation problem
and some homes probably probably there
is but apparently there's no data to
back up and if you're well ventilated it
doesn't seem to be a problem
based on tests
so I don't know it's just a silly little
thing I don't think it's going to become
law but anything could happen did you
know according to will Street Journal
the oil and gas
production or booming in the United
States gas production is an all-time
high
all right
now here I'm going to do something that
the Twitter people would never see
this is something I only do in long form
but rarely in short form
I'm going to say that the Biden
Administration did something right
right not everything
but
I do believe that from a purely
Financial perspective
um squashing Russia's energy program
is probably good for business
and I've said this before that I think
there's a really good chance
that the Biden Ukraine Focus which never
made sense to a lot of us I think it's
going to be a good investment
I is way too early to say because
Anything could happen you know Wars War
but at the moment it looks like it's
working
as an actual investment I never would I
never oh NPR said it yesterday yeah that
could turn into a narrative
now here's where I'm trying to be an
honest broker on this
if if Trump had been the one behind this
Ukraine stuff don't you think I would be
saying it was a good investment
you would expect that right because it
looks like it might be and so I'll just
say the same thing about Biden if what
we did was spend let's say in the end we
spend 200 billion dollars
if we spend 200 billion dollars and take
Russia and the energy game you know or
degrade it enough so our energy program
takes off
I think it was worthwhile
financially certainly not in terms of
life and destruction and the things that
happened over there
but financially
so don't be surprised about that
um
I have a new strategy to suggest to the
ukrainians because I know they've been
waiting for this
so there's a little bit of news coming
out that could be interpreted different
ways here's something that the people
who watch Twitter only will never know
about me
I do not believe anything that comes out
of Ukraine Pro or negative ukrainians
or Russians it's all unreliable
information I do however speak about it
in some in some cases as if it's true
but I tell you that directly I'm
speaking as if it's true we don't know
can't trust anything all right so what
are the reports as if it's true is that
the Russian Artillery strikes are down
75 percent in some important places
now how would you interpret that
is it because it's winter
and there aren't going to be any gains
either way and there's not much benefit
of artillery
is it because they're saving it for a
big push
is it that they're saving it for the
spring
or are they running out of artillery
shells
don't know do you
but there's at least some suggestion
that they might be running low on
supplies
or maybe running low on the actual
artillery what would you call it the
what would you call the device that
launches the artillery
Munitions that would be uh
just artillery
cannons guns
you call them artillery guns or mortars
wow launchers whatever
so maybe maybe they don't have enough
launchers to do what they need to do who
knows
but I read an interesting thing oh so
another fact again don't believe
anything is that Patriot systems are
coming to Ukraine soon those would be
the defensive systems
the same time they're getting more
Bradley armored vehicles for offensive
moves
so
if you were to just look at what you're
told about Ukraine at the moment oh and
one other thing that apparently one of
the biggest critics of Putin within
Russia
who has not been killed is the leaders
of the Wagner group
so the Wagner group cracked me if I'm
wrong they're mercenaries right so
Russia is using a professional mercenary
group that are Russians because they
they're badass Fighters and they're they
want to be there they're volunteers so
yeah they're professional fighters so
the Wagner group has been doing a lot of
damage and it's a big part of Russia's
whatever success again I think the
Wagner group probably does a lot of it
so we know now that the head of the
Wagner group thinks he's not getting
enough support from Putin so he's
actually criticized him which is a big
deal
now probably that's the only person in
in Russia who could criticize Putin
right now
because
because the Wagner group is too
important to the war effort they can't
kill the head of the Wagner group right
away maybe later but at the moment you
know at the moment you can't kill the
head of your most important military
Wing probably yeah and the Wagner group
was a big part of why chechnya was
eventually what would you call it
suppressed
so here's my strategy for Ukraine you
ready
they should
retarget everything and put 100 of their
efforts on the Wagner group
because you want that Wagner group to
complain even more than they are
right
you you want you want to make sure that
the Wagner group knows that no matter
what else happens the Wagner group will
be gone
because at the moment they're part of
the they're part of the bigger military
so I'm sure Ukraine you know gives them
a little special attention because
they're effective but they're still
spreading their fire across multiple
domains
my strategy is for the winter anyway
Focus all of your fire in the Wagner
group and make them complain until Putin
has to do something
what's he gonna do
What's it gonna do
because the last thing he wants to do is
turn the Wagner group against them
and then
before the Wagner group is completely
defeated
you make them an offer to change sites
when there aren't many left you say I'll
tell you what
we're just going to keep going until
there are none of you left but we
wouldn't mind having you on our side to
finish this war
I doubt they would change sides maybe
some would but you want to you want to
put those thoughts in everybody's head
like it would only take
one Wagner person to change sides and
then Ukraine knows how to turn that into
propaganda just just one just one to say
oh Russia's a waste of time we'll make
twice as much money for Ukraine it looks
like they're going to win
boom
uh let me speak to our brugmans uh
comment
because remember I started saying
nothing can be trusted
and our brother here on uh says uh that
Ukraine isn't winning anything at the
moment there's no winning going on in
fact they've lost territory
in in the war so far they have this
Ukraine is smaller and in bad shape
so they're certainly losing in that
sense and they're not making gains on
the battlefield according to reports
that are not credible and also according
to not credible reports
uh
uh the Russians might be gaining a
little bit but that's disputed all right
so does that satisfy you that I've added
the proper context
that I do not believe
you could say Ukraine is winning in in
the larger sense yet
but it looks like the
um if you believe the reporting which
maybe you shouldn't it looks like there
is something that looks like a momentum
shift that you can never be sure about
because it's still war everything's
unpredictable but at the moment it looks
like a momentum shift and then secondly
I'll just add that focusing on the
Wagner group could probably get them to
the end of this faster
that's what I think
now it could be that that's exactly
their strategy and I don't know all
right now once again do you see how if I
if I did any of this on Twitter
I would not have taken the time
to agree with the critic who says my
context is insufficient
because that con I I actually agree with
your comment my my context was a little
bit insufficient and so you challenged
me on it and so I tried to Shore that up
a little bit that's the way the long
form works if you think that should be
happening on Twitter
you don't know what Twitter is
Twitter is just talking about that one
little point and it's all it means the
stuff you left out of Twitter doesn't
tell you anything
but if I left that out of this I think
it would have told you something right
would you agree with that statement if I
had not taken the time
to agree with you that you really don't
know if Russia or Ukraine is winning or
will win
that it would be missing and it would
maybe be misleading
so I had
and it was same problem with the
pandemic stuff all right so that's by
the end of my prepared comments
and uh
is there anything I missed
anything you'd like me to speak about
that I had not by the way I if you're
following these SpaceX stuff
with the uh the starships that they have
that big tower that grabs them like
chopsticks
apparently they have
four of them
that are all loaded and ready to go at
the same time
when did that happen
when did we go from I think we can
launch
a ship like this to four of them fully
loaded and ready to go it looks like
they're they're trying to gear up where
they could just be launching spaceships
all day long
like literally like an airport Just
Launch them like an airport here's one
here's why I'm load one up here as well
and then return them and load them up
again
apparently we'll be able to put some
pretty heavy stuff up in space
and my first question is what is all
that stuff is it just satellites
at the moment is just satellites right
or maybe
something for the ISS but there's
there's nothing heading to Mars is there
how soon before musk actually sends
something to Mars
and what would be the first thing
I'd love to know their planning if I
were doing this the first thing I'd send
would be robots right
wouldn't you send the Tesla robots to
space assuming you had some way to
recharge them which you would
I think you would right
uh let me put a wild thought into your
head
it might take a long time to get humans
to Mars you know in any any kind of
quantity but we might have lots of
robots there before them
if they can if the robots can handle the
um the climate Etc
do you think we'd ever get to the point
where the robots could be uh AI driven
and simply build a civilization to be
ready when we got there
so we didn't have to give them every
order
we would just give them uh we give them
an objective the the same way they're
they're teaching robots now to assemble
Ikea products successfully
so the robot can actually pick up the
directions
and then assemble something it had never
assembled before
that's a real thing that's happening now
so if you could do that
could musk get to the point because he's
building robots they're they're almost
ready to launch and they'll be the
industrial kind could he get to the
point where he could dump a shitload of
robots on the planet and just say build
a civilization here's your end point
and then figure out what you got you
know you could have to figure out what
assets you have there plus what you
brought then figure out how to get to
here and just figure it out and we'll
we'll show up when you're done
I feel like I could yeah 3D printing CDs
to 3D print you might need to be able to
mine though
so here's a question for you are there
any mindable materials on the moon on
Mars
yes do we know that for sure you say
many
because every every orb in space has
minable good-mindable stuff don't they
like as far as we know pretty much all
of them whether it's an asteroid or a
planet they all have something
you could mine
yeah now I don't know if they would have
the right mix of of stuff
because you know you the very least you
would want is enough to build another
robot
so let me ask you this question would
Mars have all the minerals
that would be necessary to build the
robot
that goes to Mars
would it
it only needs to get close because if
it's close but not completely they can
always send a rocket with the extra
stuff it's hard to build on the moon on
Mars
not the electronics
because the electronics have Rare
Minerals
we don't know if they're Rare Minerals
on Mars do we
so it might be that the rare minerals
are the stuff you have to ship up there
in the short run
but but the Rare Minerals tend to be low
weight right let me ask you this for a
robot
what would be the total weight of a raw
raw Rare Minerals
it'd be just like a handful right
or less than that
yeah it wouldn't have been just like
an ounce you know maybe an ounce of raw
materials for the entire robot
everything else is common materials
is that the sound about right
uh you aren't running it yet you
wouldn't be able to do chip fabrication
right away or would you
or would you
if if you knew what kind of chips you
were going to make
you couldn't ship up enough equipment
and build a an environment for it
just impossible it might be impossible
but I could also imagine that you could
build a mini fabricator
in other words if if the Earth
Fabricators require a whole building and
lots of systems you don't think there's
some chance just like a nuclear plant is
usually a big building with domes and
stuff but you can also build a little
one and put it on a on a submarine which
always puzzled me by the way
that we that for a long time we've been
able to build little nuclear reactors
for military but not for
not for uh
citizens I never understood why why that
wasn't happening but
I imagine there's a way
to build a mini self-contained
um
chip fabricator
especially if it's only going to make
one one or two kinds of chips it's just
for the robots or something like that
seems like it's doable
because the engineering would still be
off-site so you don't need any
administrative space yet it's just the
mechanical fabrication part I'll bet you
could fit that in a rocket or or maybe
several rockets and pieces something
like that
uh
Russia is already what
uh all right yeah it'd be expensive of
course it's all expensive
yeah they'll need those dilithium
crystals that's for sure
all right ladies and gentlemen
um I'm going to say goodbye to YouTube
for today and talk to the locals people
privately
thanks for joining
greatest live stream you've ever seen
