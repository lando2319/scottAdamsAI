it's time for
the best live stream in the world
it's going to happen now it's called
coffee with scott adams and
i think science has proven that nothing
is better
really nothing i'm back on the mainland
uh i might even show you the view from
here would you like to see it
sure i think you would here you go let's
see if i can reverse this view for you
but uh columbus circle
you can probably guess where i'm at
but that's the view today i'm just
staying here for a few hours and then
had no wanted to break up the flight
from greece
so we did a quick sleepover in new york
city and then we're out of here in a few
hours
but not until i've done coffee with
scott adams
and if you'd like to enjoy it the
simultaneous sip that is
to its maximum extent what do you think
you need well i'll tell you you need a
copper and margarine glass to thank your
gel stein canteen chicken flask vessel
of any kind join me now for the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes
absolutely everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip and it happens
now
oh yeah that's good um
yes i'm in new york city but only for a
few hours uh
didn't have time to do anything here we
just slept overnight and then
heading home in a little bit let's talk
about the news
uh first of all i'd like to give my
compliments to
somebody at fox news i'm not sure who
but somebody wrote this headline and i'd
like to
call this out the headline reads
u.s open male streaker hits balls on
fairway
however you see however you snuck that
through your editor
good job or if you were the editor good
job
i'd like to add to that this story
do you know how that naked streaker at
the u.s open
golf tournament do you know how he broke
his leg
fell off the ball washer now if you golf
that's hilarious if you don't golf you
don't know that there's a thing that's
about the size of a parking meter
that you put your dirty golf ball in and
crank it and it literally washes your
balls
so think back to the joke
much better now isn't it now that you
have that context
well i love the story about ronnie
jackson who had been the president's
personal uh had been trump's personal
uh physician as well as
somebody else before him maybe it was
obama
and ronnie jackson is calling for biden
to take a cognitive test
now don't you think that's a good idea
and how does most of the news the entire
left-leaning news
sort of not pay attention to that story
he is qualified he you know he was a
president's physician and if a
president's physician says
hmm i think i'd give that one a
cognitive test
i think you have to respect that it
doesn't mean that there's anything wrong
but it's certainly enough of a
indication you ought to check and i
don't think anything will come with this
because obviously they're not going to
test biden
does anybody think there's any chance
any chance
that the democrats will allow biden to
take a cognitive test
nope because i think they like him just
the way he is
whatever that way is pretty sure they
like it that way
here's an interesting story
there's a company called lsat e-home
international
and they're going to build 20 what they
call e-homes
that are going to have tesla solar
panels
i believe that means as the uh shingles
so as a replacement roof kind of thing
so it's gonna have tesla
solar panels plus the tesla power walls
which are the battery that you use at
home
to store your energy when it's sunny so
you can use it at night when it's not
and then also a charging station for
your presumably electric car
and this is a pretty strong package
i have to say there's something
there's something that speaks to me
about a home
that could live for a while if the the
main grid dies
because i live in california and the
odds of our grid failing
in the next week or so are i don't know
a hundred percent we're gonna be i would
guess
there's almost no chance that i could
make it through the summer
with especially with the heat the heat
as it is
without losing electricity i think it's
going to happen
so i would pay extra i'm not sure if you
would
but i would pay extra for a home that
had that little bit of extra
electricity protection so this is this
is
great i think in terms of the uh
well in terms of the golden age i want
to see
homes that can live off the grid
tremendous
tremendous benefit to everybody i think
especially if your grid is going to get
hacked
i mean we can't stop the grid from
getting hacked
but maybe your house will be okay if you
get this this deal
so i was looking at cnn's uh
pushback on the tucker carlson
and revolver idea that there are some
fbi
assets within these various
sorry my stomach is making noise there
are some fbi assets that might be
encouraging
violence within the groups that they've
penetrated
but here's the pushback so this would be
a reason
to not believe that these fbi agents
who may or may not have penetrated these
groups we they have
are pushing them to do anything bad as
opposed to just
observing and
let me read it what ross garber a tulane
university law professor
and former cnn legal analyst said he
said quote
federal agents acting within the scope
of their duties
are never considered unindicted
co-conspirators
because by definition they aren't
conspiring with the alleged bad guys
to which i say doesn't that only matter
if they they're no longer undercover
right if they're undercover wouldn't you
have to treat them the way you're
treating everybody else but
maybe don't name them you just you know
they you tell people that they're
indicted
then they can tell their other bodies
yeah i get indicted you got indicted
i got indicted too because i'm just like
you i'm not an fbi agent
so i need i need to fact check on this
give me a fact check would there ever be
a situation
in which they would let's say the legal
system would call an fbi agent who's
still undercover
the still undercover part is important
uh what they call him an unindicted
co-conspirator just so they've
captured all the people involved but
treated them differently
is that a thing or is does ross garber
have a
solid point i'll tell you that as a
non-lawyer
reading it it's not persuasive
uh but if a few other people especially
if people on both sides who were lawyers
said yeah yeah yeah
he's right about this i could be
persuaded but
speaking about persuasion so i'm going
to focus on some
topics you've heard before don't turn it
off
there are a bunch of people who tell me
whenever you talk about vaccinations or
masks
we turn off the live stream i'm only
going to be talking about the persuasion
involved with those things right so
there's some new stuff
and that's that's worth learning the
persuasion element
so the cdc
has been saying that from their
perspective
scientifically in the scientific sense
that if you're fully vaccinated you
don't need to wear a mask
for basically anything uh but
you should obey local and maybe
business requirements now is that fair
for the cdc to say scientifically you
don't need them
but if the local officials require it
you're gonna have to obey them
and if a company requires it of course
that's a it's a right
now that's okay but i feel persuasion
wise it's a failure
here's what they should have said they
should have said
that you don't need masks scientifically
and if anybody requires you to have a
mask be they
local government or be they a company
they're almost certainly operating
non-scientifically
because you've got to arm the the
citizens right
if you're going to come out and say
science doesn't think you need a mask
if you're vaccinated say it and then say
the next thing which is
the obvious part which is if your state
government
is still requiring it they're not
they're not
not acting according to the science
because if you say that
then the citizens can act on it and just
push it through right
we can just say look the cdc just said
in the clearest possible terms
that your current rule is anti-science
or at least ignore science right
give us a little help cdc you know we're
dealing with
local restrictions companies that are
being cautious
give us a little cover just just let the
citizens do the rest we'll handle the
local stuff
you just got to give us a little cover
and you're not doing it you're giving
them an out
say it directly they're not following
the science
and then let us handle it locally we'll
take care of it
but got to give us a little cover
so there are two arguments which i'm
seeing in the news
that i consider very non-persuasive
the first article or the first argument
is that masks
work now i happen to be
on that side of the uh the belief system
but the art the arguments for why they
work
are it's hard to notice it's hard not to
notice
how bad they are so i was just reading
through a number of articles
in the you know common press about why
masks
work but here's how here's what i would
do if i were trying to persuade you that
masks work
anything i wrote on that topic i would
say
let's begin by pointing you to these
five studies
the same asks work along with maybe a
few experts from different places
who say yeah these five studies and
other reasons totally works
here's what is not persuasive
experts say masks work
no not in 2021 don't tell me
experts say masks work that doesn't mean
anything
if you want me to wear a mask don't do
it that way
point to the point to the actual studies
and then point to the experts who are
talking about those studies and then you
have something
right so i would say that the way
journalists especially are presenting
this information to the public
you shouldn't believe it because it's
presented in a non-persuasive form
should you believe uh experts when they
are non-persuasive in their
communication
that's usually telling you something if
they can't persuade you of something
that's clearly true
let's say for example it's clearly true
um i think you have every right to be
skeptical now again
i think that masks work in the right
situations here's the other
the other argument that is really poorly
made
masks don't work
wouldn't that be easy to prove too you
just
show the studies to say they don't work
whatever there's an
article in town hall essentially saying
that
masks don't work and i asked on twitter
for people to tell me what are the
obvious problems
with that analysis and there are a lot
of them
and i'll just run through a few
number one the headline didn't match the
article
which is the the headline says masks
don't work or indicates that
whereas the article says mask mandates
don't work
are those the same masks don't work
versus mask
mandates don't work no they're not the
same
so right off the right off the bat if
you see an article where the headline
doesn't match the content
you're done right yeah all persuasion
power is gone
it's just gone but there's more problems
with it
um so number one and by the way joshua
gans who you should follow
and uh is an economist and
do i always tell you that economists are
the ones you should look to
to figure out if you've at least
compared the right stuff
right because that's what economists are
good at like did you compare the right
two things
and that's usually what we get wrong um
andres beckhaus uh was pointing out
that for a start he said in a tweet
responding to this
when researchers say quote associated
with
they mean they couldn't say whether one
thing caused the other or not
so so apparently masked mandates are not
associated with some obvious reduction
in infections um
there's a reason that we favor
randomized controlled
trials right because those tend to be
fairly
you know good and everything else isn't
you know
it's not like there's a randomized
controlled study
and then there's things that are almost
as good that's not
anything there's just randomized
controlled studies
that are pretty good and everything else
is sort of closer to nonsense
now even the meta-analyses of the
nonsense
can be a problem but that's another
topic
so and then joshua gans points out
that there's also an aggravated
aggregate effect
meaning that masks might reduce
infections
but it might make people feel a little
bolder and to
risk more infection than they would
without a mask and maybe it cancels out
which wouldn't tell you if masks work it
would just tell you if mandates work
and that's a little unclear
here's my here's my personal favorite
this
that it doesn't make sense to average
mask effectiveness let me ask you this
for those of you who are anti-mask and i
know many of you are
there's many of you watching this who
say masks
just don't work all right so in the
comments
and this is only for the people who say
masks should never have been
used if your grandmother
had not been vaccinated and maybe she
had
an immune issue would you wear a mask
around her let's say you're not
vaccinated yet
you're not vaccinated would you wear a
mask around your own grandmother
who had maybe an immunity problem
i'm saying mostly knows man i would not
want to be in your family
i didn't know which way this was going
to go i'm seeing lots of yeses but more
knows
yeah so by the way this uh
demonstrates a an important principle
which is the consistency principle when
people take a stand
they don't want to change their minds
even if there's a reason to
like people will just dig in you know
and
when i ask you from a risk management
perspective
you wouldn't put on a mask let's say it
wasn't required it's just up to you
you wouldn't put on a mask around your
own grandmother
when when every expert in the civilized
world
says it's a good idea and you still
wouldn't do it
now keep in mind you might be talking to
grandma for 15 minutes
and you wouldn't wear a mask for 15
minutes
to maybe save your grandmother's life
according to
every civilized country's medical
experts
okay well at least you're consistent so
i'll give you that
um but here's my point it doesn't make
sense to
average mask effectiveness because what
are you averaging
i would say 90 of the time that i spend
or half spent
with a mask was in places that nobody
was going to get it anyway
how much of the mask wearing is outdoors
people jogging i'm looking at the street
there's all these people wearing a mask
they have no chance
of giving it or getting it walking down
the street in new york city
no chance right and yet they do
so would you average those mass squares
who are getting exactly
zero benefit with the the person talking
to their immunocomprom
grandmother for 15 minutes in a poorly
ventilated room
what does it mean to average one of
those with the other one it's like i
averaged an apple and an orange and got
a tangerine or something doesn't make
sense
so when you're looking at mask
effectiveness and this is something
andre speck has pointed out you need to
you need to slice that a little bit
finer
say these are the places we really think
it might make a difference
and then see if it does now here's the
places we're pretty sure it doesn't
but why would you average those things
together that makes no sense at all
so both the arguments for and against
masks
are so poorly presented to the public
that neither of them are credible
really they're really not now i have a
still have an opinion
that friction always works so
friction always works build a wall
doesn't stop everybody but it gives you
friction
probably reduces the number of people
coming across the border
wear a mask doesn't stop infections
period but it probably causes some
friction because the
water mod the water um the water
particles are bigger than the holes in
the mask even if the virus isn't
so you're stopping some of it right now
my understanding is that the
people who know how to look at studies
are pretty sure that the
the studies show that masks work i don't
know if those studies are
accurate or not but to be whenever your
common sense
matches what the science is it's
a little bit better than not matching
all right let's talk about uh
critical race theory let's say you don't
like it
and i think that fits for mostly people
watching this live stream
let's say you think critical race theory
and the teaching of it in schools is bad
for
your kids because it just sets up some
kind of a racial division
without solving anything which would be
a common
common point of view but what do you see
in terms of persuasion
for how to persuade against it well
mostly i see people saying uh it's
marxist
how many people do you think know what
that means
or even think it's bad or even believe
it
it took me a long time to even figure
out what that meant
and i consider myself reasonably well
informed
let's say just for the sake of argument
i'm not not trying to brag
but because i pay attention to the news
i'm probably in the top 10
of people who are informed about things
right not perfectly informed but
probably the top 10 percent only because
i spend so much time doing it
and i didn't know what the hell anybody
meant by saying it was marxist
it was it was just like it didn't
connect with anything in my brain
now later somebody made a good argument
said it's about
a class warfare so instead of class
being rich versus poor it was class as
race
black versus white etc and that made
sense
but it still was conceptual like i still
like it didn't really grab me i could
get it i could understand it
but it didn't really move me in any way
so the marxist thing may be true
it may be completely true it might be
important but has no
persuasive value to it because people
just don't know what it means
and when you say it's anti-white
if you're republican you already didn't
like it probably so
that sounds good to you but are you
trying to persuade republicans
no they're already persuaded you're
trying to persuade the people who
who are not already on your side right
if you say to them
hey your critical race theory is
anti-white
what did they say what would the people
on the left say about that
oh yeah that's what we mean yeah yeah it
is sort of anti-white
exactly that's why we're doing it it
means nothing
has has no persuasive power to say it's
anti-white
or that it's marxist i think you could
argue it's both of those things so i'm
not saying it's not
true ish right so they're both
true-ish they're not like true in the
you know there's nothing else to say
about it sense
yeah there's context but it isn't
persuasive so
i i submit the following frame instead
number one you want to simplify the hell
out of it if you're talking about
the origins of it and the intellectual
history of
of it you're already dead there's
nothing to be had there
here's what i would suggest keep it
simple like build the wall
and here's a frame that i'm testing out
so
instead of instead of saying it's
marxist or anti-white
say it teaches kids that they're either
losers or
based on their color let me say that
again
it teaches your kids that they can only
be one of the
one of two things losers or
now that's just true
meaning that when you hear it you think
oh yeah
even if you're in favor of it you feel
you feel that's true
right because the whole point of
critical race theory
is if you're born black or a person of
color that you have such a disadvantage
that you can be
relatively speaking a loser in life
and and that's your your fate you know
you're sort of locked into a
racial uh limit on your abilities
so that would be a loser maybe
maybe still winning but not winning as
much as let's say white people
in this model of things so you'd be a
loser
but let's say you're a white person in
this model
you're not doing enough are you you
haven't done enough and you
you're just benefiting from the the the
work that other people did in the past
uh you're benefiting from slavery and
racism and all that
and you're not doing enough about it
you're kind of an you're kind of
an you're just taking free stuff
and acting like you deserved it
it's kind of a jerk right now
the simplification is what makes this
powerful
but also it has to has to ring right
right when you hear it you have to be
able to say
that's kind of true and i think this
beats that
but we'll a b test it so instead of crt
for critical race theory
i think i'd replace it with loa losers
or
so if you send your kid to school which
one do you want him to learn
him him or her or what do you want them
to learn
do you want to learn that they're a
loser or an
because those are the only options that
it gives you in my opinion
here's a recommendation for a follow on
twitter if you're not already following
malcolm flex i think if you just search
for a malcolm flex
it'll pop up but his his
twitter handle is malcolm underscore
flex 48. here's why i recommend it
there are some people that you know i've
been following for a while on twitter
who consistently operate at the strategy
level of awareness
i think you could actually rank levels
of awareness
where the strategy level i put at the
top meaning yeah you have problems
we all have problems but if you use the
right strategy you you effectively
overcome them
right so malcolm's a strategy guy so
and he's got a talent stack that's one
of the best i've seen
so he's a he's a former
division one athlete so he learned you
know discipline
obviously systems because you'd have to
be a systems person to be a high level
athlete
he's also you know jacked up you know
he's just like just
immensely muscled out so he knows
discipline and hard work
and systems right so that's that's just
the start of the telephones act
but he's also an industry research
scientist he's got stem experience
he knows marketing he knows persuasion
i think some of it you may have gotten
from me he's got social media skills
he's got writing skills these are just
the ones i've seen
who knows how many other skills he's
acquired but it's very obvious when you
see his tweets and his
his opinions that he's taken a
a strategy approach to life and is
working
and i would submit to you that everybody
who takes a strategy approach
gets a good result it's very it's very
observable
you don't need a lot of science you just
look okay you're taking a strategy
approach to life
check back in five years looks good five
years later yeah that worked
if you take a victim versus oppressor
approach
how is that working out the the victim
versus oppressor thing
might be perfectly true depending how
you define it
but it doesn't help you it is a lower
level of thinking
whereas malcolm is just at a higher
level of thinking
and so if you had to follow somebody to
figure out how to live your life
i would put him high on the list so give
him a follow
there's a are you all following the
story of the transgender
uh weight lifter so there's a apparently
a
transgender uh who has is competing
in the women's event somebody who is
uh allegedly born with a male genetic
material i guess i'm not sure what the
right way to say it is these days
um i of course have a completely
different opinion than almost all of you
i think all of us all of you say that's
not fair because he's taking a spot from
a woman
but here's my take on sports in general
sports are mostly about rewarding people
who are lucky
that's it sports
are about rewarding people who are lucky
but making it look like it's something
else
because you have to be lucky to have
exactly the right kind of genetic
gifts to be a good athlete i didn't get
them
right i mean i'm a good weekend athlete
like i could play tennis better than
you know most people who play tennis but
i don't have any
kind of genetic gifts that would make me
a like a like a malcolm flex for example
i don't have anything like that
so where's where's my fairness
right it's not it's not about hard work
it's about some people are born with
genetic gifts
but one of those gifts is their ability
to work hard and stick to something
and focus that's a genetic gift you
don't really learn that
right but then on top of that you got to
be born in the right place in the right
time
you've got to have the right mentors and
you've got to you know
not be hit by lightning is basically
luck
which we dress up as skill so we can all
feel that if we were
you know tried a little harder we could
do well too
yeah and the comment was everything's
about rewarding lucky people
on some level that's true but i would
argue
that in the non-sports realm
if you have a systems versus goals
approach and if you have a talent stack
that you're building your odds of
success are
basically really good really good and
that doesn't require luck
well except the luck that you're exposed
to the idea i suppose that would be luck
so yes ultimately luck is going to drive
a lot of these things
but the reason that we enjoy watching
sports is just that we don't know how
it's going to come out
and we imagine that there's some kind of
you know grit and intangible stuff
that's driving things and that makes it
fun
but i would say the story about this
trans
transgender weightlifter it's not so
much a story about him having a dick
it's more of a story about him being a
dick isn't it
because at the moment you know he's
taking advantage
she's taking advantage of a loophole
that is sort of a dick move really it's
just sort of a dick
thing to do so i i wish this young lady
uh well in the olympics if only because
it will
maybe teach us that the olympics are
 to begin with
and that we shouldn't even have olympics
olympics made sense in a pre-internet
age
you know some reason to interact with
other countries and
you know make it a friendly competition
and stuff doesn't make any sense in
2021.
if you want if you want to have good
competition
and you want people to observe it and
watch it and entertain it
just put the same same quality of
athletes on the same teams
and forget about the gender you know if
you're good enough to play on this team
it doesn't matter what gender you are
and just
make sports organized by level of skill
in other words exactly like intramural
sports are already organized
if you're familiar with any kind of
intramural sports
they just divide it by skill level now
they usually also divide it by gender
but not always not always as long as
everybody's the right
skill range you can mix the genders and
everybody's
everybody's fine with it the you know
exceptions would be weightlifting and
wrestling and boxing and stuff
and i think those are special cases
where you just have to protect people
from
from getting hurt too badly all right
i believe i have got myself canceled
here by
accidentally using the wrong terms which
i never do intentionally so intention
has to matter for something
all right this is an incredibly stupid
take
oh we'll come back here says
maple bob oh it's maple bob uh you can
ignore ignore that
the the people who just say this is the
probably stupid tank
which part of that didn't you like did
you not like the part where
sports should be competitions among
people who are relatively
closely matched was that your problem
i don't know what your problem was
most men would be able to go pro with
coed
well why does anybody need to be pro
right
why does anybody need to be pro uh if
it's fun to watch that's good enough
you know i'll tell you that i've enjoyed
watching let's say
women's tennis more than men's so
you know and you could argue that they
don't play at the same level as the man
in tennis
which is true but i like it better so
from an
entertainment perspective as long as the
teams are matched it's great
um some of you are old enough to
remember billie jean king
playing bobby riggs the so-called
battle of the sexes back in the 70s i
think
and bobby riggs was
older in his 60s i think and
billie jean king was closer to her prime
and they played and billie jean king
beat him
and it was great entertainment it was
fun to watch it didn't matter that they
were different genders it just mattered
that it was a good match
so uh that's all i have to say about
that
now i know that you hate it when i talk
about
this topic and masks and vaccinations
and so
i'll try to keep it only to uh the
persuasion element of it and how we
think about it
whether you wear a mask or not or
vaccinated or not
it's not my call those are personal
decisions and i don't try to
influence you on that um
mass did not work during the spanish flu
some people say we don't know what
worked
during the spanish flu nobody knows any
of that
and anything you anything you say about
the spanish flu
is not likely to be right we just don't
we don't even know why it went away did
you know that
nobody knows why the spanish flu went
away
because it wasn't like uh it doesn't
look like it was hurt immunity
just sort of went away if we don't
understand that we don't understand
anything
did you see a a study that said that
i think it was drug addiction and
depression were both
related to vitamin d
doesn't mean there's a causation there
but there's a strong correlation which
is definitely uh makes you wonder
and i feel as if we might be on
some kind of a path in which we learned
that
vitamin d fixes a whole bunch of stuff
way more than we suspected so that's
that's just speculation but it feels
like that's where it's heading
um
this the spanish flu didn't come from
spain somebody says well maybe
don't know about that all right that is
all i have for you today
um i'm just looking at your comments for
a minute
yes being in the sunshine fixes a lot of
stuff i can tell you that
my uh my frame of mind and my mood
are completely dependent on exercise and
if i exercise outdoors let's say
taking a walk in the daytime i feel
better
i always feel better after spending some
time in the sun
i don't think there's ever been an
exception to that
all right that's all i got for now let
me give you one more
view of the street
see it all happening there let's see how
many people are wearing
masks walking all alone today
all right so there's a mask
there's a mask there's some there's a
mask
pulled down
well there you have it all right um
that's it for today i'll talk to you
