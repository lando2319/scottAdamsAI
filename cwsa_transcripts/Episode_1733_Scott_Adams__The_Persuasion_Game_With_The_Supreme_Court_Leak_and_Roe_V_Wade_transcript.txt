good morning everybody
and my goodness
you are energizing me so much because
of your awesomeness your curiosity
your general sexiness
and that go-getter attitude wow
am i impressed with all of you
now
would you like to take today's
experience up to heretofore
inexperienced
inexperienced
heretofore levels you've never
experienced
probably should have worked on that one
in advance
but i know you'd like to
let's take it up a notch and all you
need is a copper mug or glass a tanker
chelsea stein a canteen joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dope meat end of the
day it's the thing that makes everything
better
and makes everything go your way
it's called the simultaneous step but it
happens now go
never experienced yeah i should have
gone with never experienced
heretofore never experienced
all right we'll go with that
do i look sleepy today
because that would be
hypocritical of me wouldn't it because
i've been tweeting and talking and
writing about how important it is to get
asleep
and look at me
clearly
clearly did not get enough sleep
now
am i a failure or a hypocrite
because
i preach to you about getting enough
sleep
and clearly you can see that i'm not
succeeding at this
what do you think
here's my take on it and i'll give you
uh an example from another domain
i like to go to the gym
and uh
i have a system that i try to be active
every day one way or the other and so
often i'll feel like i don't feel like
going to the gym
and i'll go oh but i'll get ready anyway
i'll force myself to do it because i've
got a good habit going and i'll get to
the gym and i'll walk in the front door
and i'll walk you know towards the
weight room and i'll look at all the
heavy objects i'll be lifting
and i just stand there for a moment and
i say
nope
i turn back around and i walk directly
out the door get in my car and drive
home and declare victory
not failure
total victory
because i don't have a goal of going to
the gym i have a system
the system is something that
is sort of a programming i've created in
myself
to stay active every day and at least go
to the gym or or put my best effort into
it
some days you really just don't have it
but my system was so strong it got me
all the way to putting my foot
on the floor of the gym you know miles
away from my house
didn't have enough energy to complete
the transaction
but my system was a complete success
over time
i'm going to go to the gym a lot more
with this system that i will go there
and turn around and go home likewise
with sleep
while i feel that i am not succeeding at
the moment
i am doing something that is true to my
system
and here's like a little systems lesson
i am continuously experimenting
so i'm going through a a cycle of okay
what if i do you know this kind of
betting what if i
um you know get rid of more light what
if i
set an alarm oh here's here's a trick
that i've been trying lately
instead of setting alarm to wake up
which i also do but i rarely use my
wake-up alarm i don't know the last time
i used a wake-up alarm
i i set it but i'm usually awake two
hours before my alarm
so
i started setting a go to sleep alarm
so the idea is
that at 10 o'clock at night my alarm
goes off and it's just sort of
it probably doesn't make any difference
in any given night
but over time it's going to train me
it's going to be like a little uh
annoying thing that happens at 10
o'clock every night
and so
sooner or later at around 9 30 at night
if i just keep doing this
i'm going to start thinking to myself
that alarm is going to go off pretty
soon
it will just be
one extra thing i'll
test
to see if it helps my sleep system so
uh i'm gonna keep chipping at it it'll
make a difference
there's a story that i didn't read any
of the details of because i didn't want
to ruin the uh the irony of it
or not even irony stop me from using
that word please don't let me use irony
again
because we don't agree what it means
but there's a story that says that
there's a tick you know little little
bug a tick
that makes you allergic to meat and it's
been discovered in dc
so if you get bit by this tick you'll be
allergic to meat
now
what would happen if this like
this tick got everywhere
what happens if everybody becomes
allergic to meat
well
climate change would be much better
wouldn't it
well
did the climate change models
did they account for the fact
that the farting cows might be affected
by the
uh the tick
and the tick that would make you not eat
the meat would make you have fewer cows
that would be far far less is that
included in the long-term
climate models
or
just wondering
now i only use this as an example i
don't think this is actually a very big
percentage
of anything
let me check my security cameras they're
going nuts here at the moment
what the hell is attacking my house
my dog has locked that locked outside
we'll take care of that later
um
she's safe don't worry she's in a she's
in a gated area
and it's warm
so
what was i talking about
uh something about climate change yeah
so the models don't include
uh a tick
but they also don't include any one of
50 things that are going to look like
they'll change everything
you know if you're looking at an 80-year
climate model
nobody sees the
allergic to meat tick
nobody calculated that in
so just remember nobody can predict
anything more than
more than tomorrow
here's a little update
on a story that
this this one might catch you by
surprise
you remember the nexium
so-called sex cult story which was not
really a sex cult but that's another
question in which the so-called cult
leader
keith renery ended up being sentenced to
prison but i think the worst of the
charges
were a an underage girl
alleged
sex trafficking or sex related thing
it was based largely on
let's see i guess
some stuff found on a laptop
so there were some images on a laptop
and uh the dates on the images
would show that the girl was underage
and those images prove that there was
something going on or
or strongly
you know set the date of when something
was going on
and so that was a big part of how he got
uh convicted and why he's in jail
and apparently in a former fbi forensic
examiner
looked at these looked at the evidence
and concluded that it was falsified
what
[Laughter]
it looks like maybe the i think the
problem is that the dates on the images
were altered and i guess you could tell
somehow
so
they're asking for a retrial
based on the fact that
it's possible that law enforcement may
have planted planted evidence about the
worst of the charges
now what would that make you think of
the lesser charges
if hypothetically and this is you know a
long way from being proven but what if
they what if you found out that the
largest charge was fake
just what if i don't know if it's going
to happen
now
yeah i mean that would certainly make
you think twice about the lesser charges
wouldn't it
and
the next thing you'd have to wonder is
you know is it a conspiracy or
or
just like one person had a bone to pick
or is there some larger
situation here
that really needs to be looked at
because i think keith renery made some
enemies
because anybody would say a family
member of someone who
had been brought into his world they
might have some problems with it
might be some jealous husband situations
you could imagine
you could imagine lots of people who
would have a bone to pick with him and
would maybe find some mechanism to do it
now this is all speculative
i'm not i'm not saying it's going to go
one way or another i'm not supporting
him or not supporting him i don't know
what's true and what isn't but we don't
live in a world where you can believe
law enforcement anymore can you
i hate to say it but really can you can
you trust any of your institutions
not automatically
now i think that we're
we're fortunate that most of our
institutions are working well enough to
keep the system together
somewhat
i mean we're still living forward okay
but you can't you can't look at law
enforcement and say well automatically
they don't plant any evidence
you know they don't do anything illegal
because they're law enforcement i mean
we're we're so beyond that innocence
aren't we
i feel like when i was a kid
we were innocent enough that if the
police said it was true i'd say well
i get that in the inner city some of the
police are corrupt but you know that
would be the exception to the rule
but now i think it could be anywhere
yeah there's just a perfectly good
chance
that any entity anywhere in the united
states is corrupt or the individuals
within it are
all right
uh on the locals platform somebody
suggested that i create my own
disinformation panel
and at first i laughed
i thought
and i thought
why can't i
well what would stop me from creating my
own disinformation panel
let me tell you how i would do it
number one
we wouldn't have meetings
that would be you know rule number one
no meetings
number two
you'd be on the panel if i say you're on
the panel
so that that would be the mechanism
if i say hey you you're on the panel
you're on the panel even if you don't
want to be on the panel you don't even
have to agree to be on the panel you're
just on the panel
so you're appointed to the panel
and you have no choice about it
okay
so for example i might appoint
mike cernovich to the panel
or elon musk to the panel
and both of them might say i don't want
to be on your stupid panel i didn't
agree to this and i'd say that's not how
it works i'm sorry that's not how it
works
you will simply be one of the
let's say 12 people
that i toss the ball to
in a communication sense when there's a
question of what's real and what is it
that's it
so if
one of those two people i had appointed
to my disinformation panel
against their wishes
if they tweeted something that said i
believe this is true or i believe this
is not true
i would direct you to it
along with the other 11 people that i
had appointed against their will
to my panel
so i might i might throw uh
you know matt tybee on there
glenn greenwald
you know might throw them on there
no i wouldn't be on the panel myself
i would not be on the panel myself i
would be the chooser of people on the
panel
but i would keep my own opinion out of
it
now i'm seeing some other names
of people i would consider
more
political
so i would pick people only who have a
chosen ability to
disagree with their own team
you'd have to have that right
yeah guffeld would be a good example so
russell brand good example
um probably i'd pick americans just to
keep it
well
yeah i probably would
just just to keep it you know at least
national
so what do you think
what do you think yeah dave rubin good
example
so i'll hold back on who those people
would be
and you wouldn't have to like them
it could be you know alan dershowitz and
then some of you say uh we don't like
him because what he what you imagine he
did or didn't do on some case
and i'll say oh i don't care it's not
about his personality it's about a
demonstrated ability to reason through
things and to disagree sometimes with
his own team
if you have that going for you
good enough you're on you're up so i
might create a disinformation panel i
might actually do that
um
long covid there's a new study
which like all studies is completely
useless i say that without knowing
anything about it
but this one seems a little more obvious
than most
and it's about long coved and it seems
to have found that people who have long
covered are
as much as 10 points lower in iq even
after some time has gone by
and they say it's having a long covered
infection could be not for every person
of course but for
an alarming number of people the study
would say
it's almost like the cognitive decline
between the age of 50 and 70.
to which i say
what cognitive decline between 50 and
70.
i'm almost 65 and i'm getting smarter
every day i
i don't know what they're talking about
can you imagine how smart i'm going to
be a 70
my god
and what i'm waiting for
is when i reach a hundred
i am going to be so cognitively
cognitively
my cognitive liabilities
should be amazing by a hundred
because they're so good now
i mean between 50 and 65
i feel like i've picked up
seven to 25 iq points
and
i can say with complete certainty
that my cognitive occupation abilities
are excellent now
and i'd certainly notice them if they
weren't
so my smartification seems to be
amplifying
every moment that i'm alive
so i don't understand that point but
they do say you might lose 10 iq points
if you have long covet
uh but here's how they figure that out
they compared people who had long covert
to people who had never been affected
infected
huh
does that seem like the right comparison
people who have never been infected
to people who have been infected and
then they determined that the people who
have been infected
generally had lower iqs and so their
conclusion was it was the long covet
that was causing the drop in iq now keep
in mind
what they didn't
what they did not study
is the same group of people before and
after
now that would have been a good study
wouldn't it
wouldn't you like to see that study
the one right before coven and right
after now that would be an interesting
study do you know it would not be
interesting
or useful in any way whatsoever
comparing the iqs of two completely
different people and saying that the
reason that this group has differed iq
is because of this one variable
i don't know
i'm just going to put this out there
do you think that there might be a
difference in iq
in a broad range of activities in which
you could define
success and not success
are there too many fields in which a
high iq does not give you an advantage
not every person
for example not every person with a high
iq
has a high income
we're not talking about every person
i'm just saying on average because
that's what a study does it's just an
average
so on average you think there would be
any difference
between people who didn't get infected
at all and people who did
did you don't think there would be an iq
difference between those two groups
for a variety of reasons
i'm not even going to get into it but if
there's no iq difference between the
group that got infected on average again
just on average not individuals of
course just on average
you don't think there's any difference
because if there's no difference
between who got infected and who didn't
based on how smart you are
it would be the only human endeavor
where that's the case
i know that seems like an over over
claim
but can you come up with an example of
the opposite
can you give me a counter example
is there something else the humans do in
large numbers
in which the smart people universally do
worse
on average again just on average not
every person
i can't think of one
[Laughter]
vote
[Laughter]
well it feels like an opinion
voting feels like an opinion
right iq alone is not predictive of one
individual we all agree with that right
can we all agree that iq doesn't predict
what one person will do
of course of course not there's too many
other variables
but
well it can predict whether you'll be
a rocket scientist i guess
wouldn't you say
now i'm not sure that the the one thing
that iq doesn't seem to be
correlated with is happiness
although i've never seen a study but i'm
guessing
do you think do you think that iq is
correlated with happiness it might be
opposite
you know the whole ignorance is bliss
situation
so if you say to yourself i hear let me
let me counter my own argument
if the only thing that's important is
your happiness
some would argue
and smart people are worse at having it
what's the point of being smart
if it decreases your odds of being happy
it might i don't know you might be able
to get more stuff
but if this stuff doesn't make you
happier it didn't work
all right
um
let's get to the good stuff
elon musk tweeted
this tweet sunlight is the best
disinfectant i assume he's talking about
you know disinformation and twitter and
stuff but we don't know we don't know
what he's thinking we only know what he
tweeted sunlight is the best
disinfectant now let me tell you
this man knows how to tweet
of all the tweeters i've seen and i've
seen some good ones
his tweet game is just crazy good
and just the fact that everything he
says is a little bit provocative
how does he do that
how can everything you say be a little
bit provocative
but but when he says sunlight is the
best disinfectant immediately we ask how
long will it take before cnn asks
why is elon musk saying you should drink
bleach
now if that joke doesn't make sense to
you your new sources have failed you
miserably
right
because when
trump talked about light as disinfectant
cnn literally turns it into he's
recommending drinking bleach
literally
and so
and so elon musk
basically wades right into this like
dangerous edgy territory
uh and he's not even making a point in
that domain i don't think he just he
just has a way of putting everything in
a way that makes your brain catch on
fire which is definitely a skill
it's definitely a skill
all right let's talk about roe vs wade
and may we start with the following
agreement
can i can we agree on the following
none of you care
about my personal opinion about abortion
can we agree on that because i'm not
going to give it to you today
but would
are we are you okay with that because i
want to talk about only the persuasion
element of it
let's see if i can do that
now if you think you're detecting my
actual opinion
because i say one side is more
persuasive
then you're misinterpreting today's live
stream
if i say one side is more persuasive
it's just about the argument
it doesn't mean anything about my
personal opinion of how things should be
i don't think you need my opinion and i
don't think you want my opinion
but let's all agree that in in our
system i would have the right to speak
and i would have the right to vote on it
but
there's no reason you need to know what
it is and i don't want to influence you
on it i don't want to influence you at
all
um
so here's let's just talk about the
persuasion okay
number one
more persuasion that we live in a
simulation
these are two weird things
i just want to start with the weirdness
of them because it just just doesn't
look like it could be a coincidence
probably is
but it doesn't look like it could be
that's the fun of it
in all literal truth
it turns out that there's a horse
medicine
that is exactly the same medicine
that is used for the one of the pills
for
i guess you'd call it an abortion if you
take the pill to
technically that's what it is right
so the left is literally recommending
horse medicine
oh
like
what
like there's nothing you can even say
about this
right
am i right there's nothing to say about
it you just have to experience this and
say
is the simulation tapping us on the
shoulder
because this feels like a prank at this
point doesn't it
does this feel like somebody's playing a
joke on you to see how long it takes
before you realize that you're a
simulation it's like watch this
we're going to make now the left
recommend horse medicine for people
we'll see if they catch on
if this doesn't tell you that somebody's
messing with us
i don't know what will
okay i do know what will
here's another one
how many of you had never made this
connection
when we're talking about abortion we're
talking about roe versus wade
what do what do roe and wade have in
common
there are two things you do when the
water rises
you either gotta
row your boat or you've gotta wade
through the water
what does a fetus live in
a bag of water
i don't know that it means anything but
what are the odds that this
you know this important case
would be two different things you can do
in water
about
a fetus that's in a bag of water
like just a coincidence
i don't know
i don't know but how many of you made
the connection that rowing and waiting
are just two things you do in water
what were the odds of that
i mean just a coincidence but
if it just feels like we're being told
something right and i'm not saying we
are it's just it gives you that weird
feeling
all right question number one
the uh the leak of the draft opinion
uh yesterday before the the news came
out that it had been confirmed as a
legitimate
real draft so the supreme court
justice roberts chief justice confirms
that the draft is 100 real
now yesterday i said to you uh
there's something sketchy about this and
i said the possibilities were
it was a complete hoax
another possibility is real and and
that's the actual opinion and that's the
way it's going to go down
and then the third option i floated was
that it's a real draft
but does not represent a real decision
and that's what justice roberts said
it's a real draft that does not
represent a real decision
but you're saying to me scott scott
scott
he's not going to write 98 pages of a
detailed decision
unless it's kind of a decision
like i get that technically it might not
be
technically
but in reality
is somebody going to write a 98-page
decision
before the vote
and the answer is
yes
yes
and
here's how you should see this
98 page
draft
number one
it has to be seen as persuasion within
the court
if you want to persuade somebody write
it down
if you think your argument is strong
that's how you persuade now if we know
if we believe that the process is that
they haven't voted yet
and if we believe that there might be
some changes in opinions
one way you would get to a changed
opinion is to show somebody exactly what
they would be voting for
not approximately but exactly what they
would be voting for
so that they could say okay now that
it's written down as a majority opinion
that is exactly what i'm voting for so
my my inclination to say yes has now
been confirmed
my yes is a yes
but
other people might look at it and say
okay
now that i see it this specifically
i've got this problem with it and i just
can't now that i know exactly what i'm
voting for i'm not for it
so
having been one who had a job of making
business cases there are two reasons to
explain
or to write a business case
one of them is to get it approved or
signed or in this case it would be the
decision that's one reason the second
reason is to see if your argument holds
together
and i've been through this process a
number of times there are times when i
would be told okay write this business
case
to support why we should or should not
do this thing and that i'd write the
case and it would come out the opposite
of what we thought we should do because
the numbers didn't work
so it was the writing of the business
case
that showed me that i wanted to do the
opposite of what i thought i wanted to
do
right this is
i would imagine
that given the size of this issue and
how it will you know rip the country
apart
likely
that the justices would write a very
detailed draft
before
uh in at an earlier stage than normal
because this isn't a normal issue and
they would know that this is a destroy
the republic issue potentially it's that
big
so i think the justice was justices
would say
that this draft opinion
might not be
like regular draft opinions
this might be
at least in some people's opinion
something somebody might have wanted to
leak
because a big part of what the supreme
court needs to balance is will their
decision destroy the republic
now i don't know if that's actually
written into their job description
but of course they're going to consider
that of course they will it doesn't
matter if they're not supposed to of
course they will
you would anybody would
so how would they know exactly
what the public opinion would be unless
there was something that looked like a
complete opinion
that was circulating
because remember one of the big
questions is how limited would this
opinion be and what has spread to these
other topics we'll talk about that
the this detailed opinion answers that
question
and as joel pollock reported in
breitbart and i think he's the first one
to say this specifically i didn't see it
anywhere else
that if you read the draft opinion it
specifically
limits it
to this issue and specifically
excludes anything you might try to
generalize it to
so the question's been asked and
answered in the draft
isn't that important
that's important because biden is out
there telling you that exactly the
opposite of what the draft says
so they have to say the opposite of what
the draft says
because their strongest argument
is arguing about something that isn't
there
that's their strongest argument we'll
talk about that in a minute the
persuasion element
so
um i would say that
generally speaking that this specific
draft should not be viewed like any
other
supreme court draft
and should not be seen as automatically
a reflection of their opinion
they could become so spooked
by the public reaction
that they don't change it
good my guess is that the court is you
know clearly leaning toward the majority
opinion
we all believe that right
if you had to bet on it you'd bet you
bet that they're currently leaning
strongly in that direction
but
if they're watching for the public
reaction
that is a whole new variable that could
easily swing a vote
easily swing a vote
easily
and
they of course might try to
and of course the supporters will try to
frame it as a change in
or an improvement in the system of who
decides moving it from the courts to the
states which is a more appropriate place
for local decisions
so no matter how hard anybody tries to
defend it as an improvement in the
system
it's going to look like
and in a practical sense it will be
a removal of somebody's i'm not going to
use the word right but a removal of
their ability to do it without
consequence
so people will be losing something in
their opinions
even though it's a it's just a
system shift in theory it does change
things in reality
all right
so
i'm going to say
and
that in my opinion
this could go either way still
the actual vote could go either way
still
and they're waiting to see how big the
outcry is how big will the outcry be
well rasmussen did a
quick poll and so you've been hearing
that what 70 percent of the public
is in favor of abortion
um here's the here's rasmussen's poll
51 percent
are in favor of abortion rights
and 40
are pro-life so the opposite
so that would be a clear advantage but
nowhere near 70 percent
right and and uh that will still leave
some undecideds
but
if you look at here's where it gets
interesting
if yet rasmussen also asked whether
people uh approved of the supreme court
overturning row
48 approved of it
and 46 opposed it
so if you look at who's pro abortion
versus pro-life there's there's a
serious gap there you know good 20 gap
or so 25 percent yeah 25 difference
um
but if you looked at who wants to change
the existing situation it's almost a tie
i think statistically that probably is a
tie 48 to 46. so the country is evenly
split about changing
the situation
he ex just evenly split
that's a pretty serious problem when
it's one of the biggest issues of life
and death
some would say
you know that's one point of view
um that's just hotter yeah you don't get
a hotter potato than that
so would the supreme court be influenced
by the size of the revolt
and i would say yes so here's here's the
most contrarian take you'll ever hear in
your life
you ready for this
the leak
as egregious as it is
is helping the system
i i didn't imagine that that would be my
opinion today because i just arrived at
at this moment but when i look at this
whole situation
obviously
obviously the leaker needs to face
consequences do we agree on that
can we agree that there should be
consequences
you don't want to encourage this
you don't want this to be a precedent
it's the worst thing in the world for
the system the system is definitely
damaged by this
and you want to you want to do
everything you can to discourage this
in the future so i'm anti-anti-anti-leak
absolutely anti-leak
but maybe there's an exception
and it looks like a human being at least
one
made a decision
to
help the republic
maybe maybe
maybe
by doing something
deeply
inappropriate
according to almost everybody
because
elon musk says sunlight is the best
disinfectant right
and when when he said that out of
context didn't you agree
you agreed didn't you
when you heard it out of context
sunlight is the best disinfectant you
said to yourself yeah we want
transparency we want to know what's
going on under the hood we'd actually
like to know what's happening behind
those closed doors we want to know what
people are thinking
we want to know everything we can about
everything
well you just got it
you just got what you wanted
you you got some radical transparency
and some citizen
and i'm really gonna piss you off now
a patriot
just gave it to you
sorry
it's possible that you're not going to
hate whoever did this
it's possible you're not going to hate
him
because if i could have scripted this
and chosen how this would play out i
would do it just like this
if i could cause the situation to unfold
in the best possible way
it would be with the lake not without a
leak it would be with a link
because the leak is doing exactly what
you'd want the league to do
it's giving the supreme court
the information they need to make the
right decision
now i don't know that they'll make the
right decision you will disagree no
matter what they do but i'm saying that
it gives them the maximum amount of
information because they're going to see
what the public
reacts to they're going to see what the
law looks like exactly we'll all
we'll all become far more educated in
the process
this leak is going to force us to be
educated in the same way that trump
used to force us to be educated about
 we didn't understand before
and suddenly we were like oh god i guess
i'm going to have to go understand this
now
because i didn't care about it before
like how much do you know about
immigration
that you didn't know before trump was i
mean you knew it was bad but that's
about it and now we're all like
immigration experts
we can tell you where the wall needs to
be built and how much it costs
right
so this this leak
is going to have the same
absolutely positive effect to the
republic
but
here's where we have to be smart
can we
are we wise enough
to treat this as the exception that it
is
and should remain
can we say that the holocaust is the
only holocaust
that slavery was the only slavery
and that there are some things an
abortion is one of them that just don't
have analogies
they are simply they must be one-offs
they cannot be forced into the same
system
in every way in most ways yes but not in
every way there's some things that just
have to be different
and i would prefer living in a system
in which somebody leaks this
now
that's probably going to make some of
you really mad and i would actually
respect your opinion on that
if that bothers you i completely get
that
because you have two bad choices here
one choice is to
protect the system and that impulse is
very strong and very good
i would like to protect the supreme
court and the republic as much as
possible
but
sunlight is the best disinfectant
i can't change that
i can't change the fact that if it's
going to be the most important decision
in the country i want more information
about it not less
and boy did we get more information
we got all the information you're ever
going to want 98 pages of it and a
minority opinion is still coming we're
going to read that too or at least we'll
read the summary
so
i can't
you know i guess i was as shocked and
offended as every citizen was and should
have been yesterday when they heard the
story of a leak it seemed
just so wrong
like it offends like just like in a
basic like biological level or something
it doesn't even seem intellectually it
just seems like a violation like you
feel almost physically violated by by
that leak don't you
it's still wrong
yeah and and i'm not saying that the
person who did it is
should be free of consequence
because whistleblowers do take that risk
yeah i believe that somebody did it
because they thought it was good for the
country
now you might disagree
but
you might you might disagree whether
it's good for the country but let me ask
you this question do you think they did
it
for purely political reasons or do you
think the person who did it did it for
the benefit of the country in their
opinion
what do you think
i'm seeing a mix purely political
purely political
some saying both
some say scapegoating political so most
people are saying political on the
locals platform over on
youtube political political both see i
think i think whenever you say things
are done for one reason you're wrong
and i don't even know what the topic is
right if you have a complicated topic
no matter what it is uh
taxes employment abortion no matter what
the topic is if it's complicated
and you think that somebody did
something for one reason
you probably don't you're probably wrong
because people don't really do things
for one reason
most things have multiple
benefits and multiple costs
so my guess is that somebody was
political yes
i feel like that's safe to say it's
definitely a political act
can we agree on that can we agree that
no matter what else it was it's 100
political
maybe that's the better way to ask the
question let's start with a base
agreement that is political
but on top of that
was it also patriotic
in my opinion
probably because it's probably somebody
who believes their political opinions
match patriotism
that's a safe assumption do you think
most people believe that their own
political opinion
is compatible with what they would call
a patriot
no
it appeases terrorists
you know i i even
this is the one issue
and i guess this is why i'm not giving
you my personal opinion on abortion this
is the one issue where i have 100
respect for both sides
and that's rare meaning that
both sides are have a start
they have a different assumption
starting point
and then they reason from the different
assumption
but their reasoning isn't bad they just
start with a different assumption
all right
here's my persuasion analysis when the
left says they're losing the right to
abortion do you recognize that
persuasion play
they're losing the right
what persuasion play is that
uh
well fear yes
fear
all right is thinking beyond the sale
because the question the question that's
being
bandied about is whether the supreme
court
is the place to make the decision
the supreme court is not deciding
whether abortion should be legal or
illegal
they're silent on that they're only
deciding whether the supreme court is
the one to decide
it would be the states to decide it
if they bail out
and
here's the other part so the first part
of the technique is making you think
past the sale and incorrectly making you
think that it's about abortion rights
it's really about who decides
the second part of it is
that we know from
studies
that people are more likely to respond
to losing something
than to the potential of gaining
something
do you all know that
it's people will respond more
emotionally to taking something away
from you
that you thought you had
than to oh i might get i might get a
free thing
right so lost aversion is always the
stronger one so that's so persuasion
wise
framing it as losing the right is a
really good
technique because it activates their
side of the uh the thing
all right
here's some more uh persuasion
stuff
um
have you noticed that the
people who are uh opposed to abortion
can say all of their reasons in public
and clearly and pretty much they're all
the same right if i were to characterize
the the pro-life side
they would say most of them would say
something like
um
my religious belief or maybe even my
intuition
says that
life begins at conception
they just have that strong feeling
and that life is sacred
and that
that it shouldn't be ended for any any
reason
now you can agree with that or disagree
with it but
it's very they all have the same
argument when you say it's basically the
same argument
and
and it's clean
and it's something that people are proud
to say in public
am i right i've never heard anybody who
was pro-life
who is shy about saying it
like usually people are quite proud to
say that
now compare that to
what biden said about
the abortion rights situation than the
supreme court thing
he says the dra in the tweet biden said
the draft opinion calls into question
the fundamental right to privacy the
right to make personal choices about
marriage
whether to have children and how to
raise them
these are fundamental rights for
americans a critical part of who we are
now
i sometimes i read tweets before i read
who sent them and this was one of those
cases and when i read this i got to the
part about
how this is going to change your
fundamental choices about marriage and
whether to have children and how to
raise them i thought
who's the dumb who would say that
like in public
like
who would be so dumb
that they would say that in public
that's just the worst argument ever
i mean especially given the joel
observation
that the specific
thing in question
eliminates these possibilities this
isn't even on the table
this stuff and if it were on the table
there would be nobody who favored it you
know like just everybody would be not in
favor of this
so what does it tell you when one side
of the uh argument can tell you in
public proudly what their opinion is
and the other side has to use what i
call laundry list persuasion
have we talked about that before
laundry list persuasion
is where you hope that if you give 10
reasons
somebody's going to say you know i don't
know too much about this issue but if
there are ten reasons
ten reasons is pretty strong
that's way more than nine
way more than three if this were a two
reason situation
and i didn't understand any of those
reasons i'd say well it's only two
reasons maybe they're not real but once
i see there are ten reasons
that i don't understand one of them in
any way whatsoever
well i don't need to understand this
topic do i do i need to be an expert to
count to ten i do not there are 10
reasons that's all i need
so that's what laundry list persuasion
is it tries to make the argument by
quantity without any regard to whether
any of the reasons have any merit
whatsoever
so one side is using a persuasion tactic
which is designed for weak arguments
it's designed for weak arguments
but do the people on the pro-abortion
side have weak arguments
no
they don't
they have strong arguments they have one
weird quality
you don't want to say them in public
sorry
their arguments are strong
from just a persuasion perspective right
i'm not i'm not giving you my opinion on
abortion that's not any of this it's
just a persuasion
if they said their actual argument
i would say oh well that's a pretty good
argument
would you like to hear the argument
they value their own life and freedom
over that of a maybe baby
because to the left their starting
assumption is well this fetus might be a
baby might not it's a maybe baby
and if they were to say their opinions
just
cleanly and clearly i would respect them
and they would say you know it might be
a baby it might not i'm no expert on
babies or life or any of that maybe it's
a baby maybe it isn't i just value my
own freedom
my own economic well-being and my own uh
choices and my body i just put those at
a higher value
than i put
a potential life
that's a strong argument
now you could you could disagree with it
and you could throw up what do you hear
you could say my god you're valuing
things different than differently than i
value them and that is correct
but
remember what you're disagreeing about
is the assumption
it's just the assumption you're
disagreeing with the value of the maybe
baby
if you think it's life and sacred you go
one direction if you think it's well i
don't know what it is
is something that could be or maybe not
why should i let my life be determined
by something that's a maybe
you you can imagine somebody having that
opinion and not having a moral
element to it at all
and i would actually respect somebody
who said it directly like that
i think it's good for women i'm a woman
i'd like to have the choice
um i i'm not so concerned about the
well-being of something that might might
become a baby
in my opinion or might not
so this is a weird discussion because
one side can say exactly what they think
and exactly what they want
one side has to use the fog of argument
the laundry list persuasion because it's
just a little bit embarrassing to say
you're so selfish
now here's a question for you
is there any narcissism that's affecting
this debate
possibly
i don't know but possibly seems to
affect everything
all right um
then i saw this argument somebody said
can a woman you know how would you feel
if a woman made decisions about a man's
body now this is exactly why i stay out
of it
the reason i stay out of it with my
personal opinion is because i put myself
in the in the
place of a birthing human
which i call them because i'm woke
and you poor poor bastards are
wallowing in the past
you still call them women i know i know
but i call them birthing people
and
since i'm not a birthing person
i would not want
anybody making a decision about me if i
were
likewise
if if women were mostly the ones
deciding on
vasectomies or
circumcision
i'd have something to say about that too
so i do think that the closer you are to
the topic the more influence you should
have over it
i mean as a general rule and since i'm
not a birthing person now or later i
think that people who are closer to that
world should be making those decisions
and i'll kind of stay out of it but this
question made me laugh can a woman make
decisions about a man's body and i
thought to myself
i think that happens to every husband
every day
pretty sure i'm pretty sure your wife is
making a decision about your body
every damn day
because you know what's good for your
health
vigorous sex
with a loved one that's really good for
your health
everybody agrees there's no doctor who
would disagree that making love with
your spouse and and enjoying it would be
good for your health am i right i'm
right
so every day
if you're married there's a woman who
makes a health decision about a man's
body now it's about her own as well i'll
grant you that
but
uh it's pretty much every day
all right it's just a joke
don't get so don't get so technical with
me all right i know it doesn't describe
your situation
all right
um
that
is my persuasion take on the debate
which is really the only thing happening
today seems like
is there anything else you would like an
opinion on on the persuasion element
of the debate
yeah if you separate the child's support
question from the question of having the
baby
then yes you could take men out of it i
100 think that men should decide about
their economic
impacts
so i i would certainly weigh in about
who should pay for what
uh if you'd like an opinion on that
so dave chappelle got attacked on stage
by somebody who apparently had a gun and
a knife now we don't know the details of
that but that was a report he was at the
hollywood bowl
somebody jumped on stage with a gun and
a knife but he was apparently unhurt
now what do we know about the
perpetrator
if he had a gun and a knife
and he got to dave chappelle
and yet dave chappelle was unhurt
what could we conclude
about the person
not a
conservative i don't think a
conservative would have
missed
sorry
probably a left-leaning person i think
that's what you're going to find out
yeah i'm guessing something about
the trans
community probably that would just be a
guess though
and chris rock was actually in the
audience
because the simulation
oh i'm not making this up a comedian
gets attacked on stage and chris rock is
sitting in the audience
that actually happened
yeah it wasn't will smith we checked
that's pretty funny
um
all right i saw a joke but i'm not gonna
repeat it
uh
chris rock
chris rock asked if it was will again oh
did he did he make that joke that would
have been hilarious
all right
yeah top that
was my opinion regarding the timing of
the league oh yeah let's talk about the
timing of the league you know uh one
thing let me give a little uh shout out
i was watching the five yesterday
discussing the leak and i thought i
thought they had especially dana perino
had the best takes
on you know the things you hadn't heard
yet that kind of gave you the best take
on that
um as far as the timing of the leak
uh someone pointed out online that if it
was someone from the left
what
um wouldn't it be just as good if they
waited until july
because it could have come out in july
and then the energy would have been
through the roof
and closer to the election so it would
have been maybe more of an election
issue
if we hadn't worn it out before the
election
so that's one argument but i would say
somebody could also think you wanted to
get a head start
because you might need to build a lot of
momentum around it so it's like it's the
only thing you're talking about and and
the sooner you did this
the sooner it could erase biden's other
mistakes right
so i think the smarter argument is that
doing it now was a perfect time if
you're about if you're a democrat
it was a perfect time because it not
only erased
the current headlines that are all
negative
but it's a an issue they can't die
and it's going into the summer
so the protests will start to get
organized now it's the right kind of
weather for you know it's always summer
right summer is the protest season so
it's perfect for the protest season you
wouldn't want to be at the end of the
protest season you want to be at the
beginning
so uh but then there are other motives
if the person doing it was a patriot
which i think is a distinct possibility
then they just wanted the country to see
it as soon as possible
and that that the the country's reaction
could be included in the decision maybe
so that would argue for sooner is better
because then it influences the decision
as opposed to
being after the decision
so everything argues for a left-leaning
person to have released it
the only argument for a right-leaning
person is if it was an inoculation
but that would be a bad play
because the inoculation
would also be wiping out all the
headlines that were already negative for
biden
if you were on the right your best play
would be to do nothing all the time
because you're already winning
so
people on the right don't have an
incentive to make a big
play
right it's just
just grind it out and you can get
everything you want it looks like you
know
every there could be plenty of surprises
but
it would look as if
the republicans should just grind it
down and not do anything provocative
just
just coast and then take a complete
victory
but democrats needed to pull a rabbit
out of the hat
am i right this is definitely rabbit and
of hat situation
kind of stuff
um so i would say the argument is
strongly on the side of someone left
leaning
uh releasing it
but i will not rule out that that they
were just a patriot and they thought
they were doing the right thing for the
country
um
rick wilson identified the leak as fake
news but claimed it came from the right
well i think it was
too soon and so that's why i avoided
doing it
too soon to say it was definitely fake
news
and now we know it's at least a
confirmed draft
what do you think about the idea that
russia is trying to reinstall trump
well
what could russia do about it at this
point
if trump runs
i don't know that russia has any
any impact on that
you know we're not even talking about
ukraine anymore
and by the way
how many of you have come around to my
point of view that it looks like the
united states thinks it can win
just outright win in ukraine
how many of you think that that's
actually the way the government is
thinking at this point
do you think so
yeah a few more yeses
because the longer this drags on and
with the more
firepower we put in there
the more it's going to look
like we must have planned to win
when was the last time i was truly
shocked by something
i can't tell you
because because
it was so shocking that a lot i can't
even tell you
can't even tell you
but let me let me tell you
uh that the the past few years have been
pretty illuminating
all right
um
and by the way there are there are
things i know about most of these
stories that
oh damn you
damn you
i just every once while i see a comment
that's just so perfect that i lose my
complete trait of thoughts
um
the disinformat the disinformation bill
money is in the ukraine bill
great
over on the youtube platform the locals
people can't see it but about every
fifth comment uh refers to me as clop
now
uh let me ask you this how how long do i
have to stay alive
before it will look like maybe i didn't
make any mistakes in the pandemic
uh is there is there any standard for
that like suppose i live to 100 and i
don't have any clots
will you say well
you know
you played it right
or are there there's no winning in this
is there at what cost at what cost
exactly there's no way to win is there
it's a no-win situation all right
most of the people who call me claw
adams believed that i was
pro-vaccination
um but
that's the way it goes
so people will believe anything
all right that's all for now i will uh
i will talk to you later see you on see
you tomorrow
