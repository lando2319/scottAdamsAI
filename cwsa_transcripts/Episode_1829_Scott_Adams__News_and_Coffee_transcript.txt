it's about time i got here
let's close these curtains
yeah
there we go
well i think i should uh print my notes
what do you think
yeah yeah i'm up late i know i know
i know i know
it's the best ever start
from the best ever show
of all time
so you know what i was doing i was a
desperately looking through the news to
see if there was any
but there wasn't any no the sip is
upcoming
i'm waiting for my notes
it's got to be in the right order
it's all got to be in the right order
[Music]
yeah we're gonna have a small
small crowd here today
oh
now let's see if we can get back on
track
there we go
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization itself coffee with scott
adams it's going to be a weird one today
because it turns out there was no news
you know every once in a while you wake
up and
ah there's no news but we do have the
simultaneous separate and that's going
to make you feel great
and all you need is a copper bug or
glass a tanker telesis diamond canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
filling with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine here
the daily thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
happens now go
it's okay jen i made it
i know you were getting nervous
let me tell you when i looked at the
clock and i saw it was
already a minute too late before i'd
even started signing out and i said to
myself
i've let you down
but watch me make up for it by the
finest content you've ever seen in your
life
the three kremlin uh generals got fired
does that happen today
well i didn't see it
so i started writing my uh
oh gotta be a sneeze
no use my technique
i'm mentally sneezing
and go on
you know what's funny
is i i literally cured this knees
i'll never get credit for that
if you're not aware of the technique
if you have to sneeze
just imagine you're sneezing just
visualize yourself actually sneezing it
takes away the physical sneeze
i just did it in front of you i i had i
had a sneeze coming that there was no
way i was going to stop
and i just used my technique it just
totally went away
if you if you haven't tried it
it'll freak you out
it'll totally freak you out that it
works
yeah you can see the other people they
people have tried it it does work
i mean seriously
why is that not on my wikipedia page
i cured
the sneeze
well i'm not making that up i actually
cured the common sneeze
that should be on my my primary
accomplishment in my whole life
yes
well okay keyword
maybe cured is a strong word
i like it anyway all right anyway
you all know about this esg stuff that's
uh hitting corporations
the environment and
social something and
governance
but anyway it's the uh
it's the u.n trying to make corporations
better citizens and their opinions so
they've got this little way of rating
them and there's these independent
agencies that rate companies etc
and um
so on i think september 12th is the a
week of dilbert mockingland but i think
i might do another week
i feel like it needs two weeks of
mocking
and i thought that the first week i
didn't really
land the punch i wanted to
i need at least one of these esg jokes
to be super viral and i didn't quite hit
it on the first week but you'll see
those anyway
um
what do you think do you think i can get
rid of esg
i think i can
but you have to give me until the end of
the year to mock it out of existence
if you're a ceo
and you're all in on esg
um
it probably means because you were
coincidentally doing all that stuff
anyway
i've got a feeling that the only people
who support it are the ones who get good
grades
for doing the things that they were
going to do anyway
i understand trump has a new haircut
so i saw some still photos
is that true
did you see trump has a new haircut
i mean i wasn't sure if i was seeing it
right
um
it means he's running
it probably does mean he's running
but
uh do critical race theory
let me do one thing at a time here
all right
anyway
um his uh his new haircut looks good
actually if that's what he was if that's
really real
and what did his critic say about his
new haircut just take a guess
just a wild guess
what trump's critics said about his
haircut
it looked exactly like hitler's haircut
that's right
they actually turned his haircut
into a hitler reference
so it doesn't take much
how many of you would agree with the
statement that biden now has solid
victories
accomplishments
how many of in
and when you say accomplishments is for
his base right
no fair saying you don't like them
that's different
but did he accomplish a number of things
that his base
is happy about
i would say he has i would say yes i
don't
you know at this point
democratic majority
it looks like they got some stuff that
they wanted
and they didn't get nearly as much as
they wanted which suggests that the
system is working
now
personally
i kind of like a system that goes back
and forth between democrats and
republicans is there anybody else who
appreciates
that that gets us to a better place even
when we
you know we don't like
what the other side does whatever side
that is for you
but
i really like the fact that one side
doesn't get to run too long
before the other side corrects it i feel
like that's healthy
yeah i don't know
to me i'm watching a system work exactly
the way i wanted to
i'm seeing some votes that maybe i would
not have supported
but
that's the way it works i mean i'm not
supposed to be delighted with everything
that the government does
sometimes other people get to be
delighted
maybe this time it's their turn
and you know if if the country doesn't
like that
oh well
let me tell you another
controversial opinion that i have
if there's a close election let's say
for president
and one side just barely wins just
barely wins
and then they they get their way but
even though they just barely won
i'm okay with that
even if i don't like the stuff i mean
i'd have to like dislike it a lot to you
know change my mind
but i feel like that if if even if i
think that
my side might have won if the election
had been audited
yeah
i can't get too angry
about the majority of the country
getting what they want
in in a system which i support which is
you know a democratic republic kind of a
system i know i i have a i have a tough
time getting too worked up about the
country getting what it wanted
with a system that we all supported
we can complain because that's part
that's who we are but
overall it's not the worst thing in the
world
i just realized that this large climate
bill
the climate slash inflation bill that
now they're turning into a climate bill
have you seen that the
democrat leading pundits have stopped
saying it's an inflation bill because
it's just such a lie
and that was the climate bill
but apparently the largest climate bill
in history has no support for new
nuclear plants
is supposed to be
neutral on what it um supports right the
whole point was to make it energy
neutral not
not loving solar by hating coal and gas
but obviously they're hating on new
nuclear plants because there's nothing
in there to to make them happen
so it looks to me like
democrats have snatched defeat from the
jaws of victory i would say the only
thing that could have saved us climate
wise
was an aggressive push to nuclear plants
is the only thing they left out
the only thing that i think would have
worked
to address climate change is an
aggressive stance to build new nuclear
power plants and it's not in the plan at
all
at all
i think there's some stuff for keeping
existing ones open but that's not nearly
enough
so i would say that um on a policy basis
uh
an obvious failure
obvious failure so i think if you leave
out the most obvious solution to climate
change you'd have to say it's the
biggest failure
in climate legislative history
is that too strong
if you take the democrats view that
there's an emergency
how do you leave out the only solution
the only solution is nuclear
and i even think that
elon musk would agree with that
i'd love to
hear his opinion about you know elon
musk has said we could get all the power
we want
with a certain amount of
solar panels plus batteries
but i think he's still pro nuclear
is he not
i'd love to hear his opinion because
to me this looks like
the biggest climate failure of all time
because i don't think we're going to get
another chance to do something this big
that
addresses climate and if you waste your
one shot
and you don't even
light up the target that's the main
target which is
doing something about the climate
because
at nuclear being the main main way you
can deal with it
all right
well
so big victory politically but a
gigantic defeat for the
planet and i would say it dooms us to
certain annihilation
we're doomed to certain annihilation
according to the democrats own plan
unless that those solar panel panels get
a lot better
so i chanced upon a piece of content
on the television device that i
recommend
i was quite surprised
so apparently newt gingrich is he's got
some kind of production company
and there's a
i guess i call it a documentary on
george washington
didn't you think you knew everything you
needed to know about george washington
i i felt like i learned some stuff that
was actually just
really interesting
and i recommend it so i'm only halfway
i'm only halfway through and i already
recommend it it's it's good enough so if
you like your american history which i
do and you like your
stories about the founders
this is a really good one i thought i
thought newt did a real good job and his
people so
newt's actually he narrates part of it
as does
calista
i believe is her name
so
check it out check it out if if you like
interesting stories about the founders
there's some really good stuff there
about washington
um
well
there's practically no news today is
there
it's like almost no news
uh rasmussen had a poll
um
and 50 56 percent of likely u.s voters
believe every state
should require that ballots be
immediately available for a bipartisan
review after the election
so
well over well 56 percent of voters
would like to be able to immediately
have a bipartisan
review or i guess you could call it an
audit
immediately after the election
how many people would be against
the ability to audit an election
immediately
like who just to guess
how did you do that again
i i have the smartest viewers
i just throw on a random question and
you all get the right answer yeah it's
23
but you were very close a lot of you
guessed 25
yeah about a quarter of the public does
not want to be able to find out if the
election was uh fraudulent or not
okay
about about a quarter of the people
don't don't care if the election was
fraudulent or not
don't need to check that all right
in the next 10 minutes some of you are
going to say
damn it scott we thought you were done
talking about vaccinations
is everybody who's watching me smart
enough to understand the following
nuance
i don't give a about your
vaccination
i don't care if you're vaccinated i
don't care if you're a god damn pin
cushion
i don't care if the vaccination killed
you
i don't care if it saves your life i
don't care if you
jab yourself with it all day long i
don't care if you ignore it
but i do care if you understand how to
analyze facts
can can we handle this is everybody
adult enough that you can handle the
fact i don't give a about your
vaccination status
i don't give a about what you
believe
the vaccination does or does not do i
don't give a if you call it a shot
or a jab or a vaccination i don't give a
if you're mad that they said it would
prevent transmission and it clearly
doesn't
i don't give a about any of that i
don't give a about your blood clots
i don't give a about your opinion
about whether i got it
are we clear on all that
because the next thing the next comment
you're going to see is i thought you
were done talking about vaccinations
scott i'm done about talking
vaccinations i'm only going to talk
about
how we analyze data okay
the vaccinations will just be the canvas
so stan hazen shows me these statistics
and he says that uh
basically he shows that the more shots
you got
the more likely you're going to die
so the the greatest number of deaths are
among the people who got the most shots
and so
right it proves that the stand doesn't
know how to
look at data
because obviously the people who believe
they're at the greatest risk get the
most vaccinations
right so obviously whether these shots
or vaccinations or jabs whatever you
want to call them
whether they worked or did not work you
would see the same data
it would look it would look the same
whether they worked or did not work in
terms of protecting you from dying or
getting seriously ill
so that's the first thing you cannot
tell anything by looking at the number
of people who died
based on their vaccination status tells
you nothing
the only thing you could know
is if you could isolate the people with
the exact same conditions
let's say the people who have four
comorbidities or whatever
and the people of a certain age and
maybe even gender and maybe even
ethnicity so you've corrected for as
many variables as you can
once you've corrected for all of the
variables
it might tell you something
but it doesn't tell you something at all
until you've corrected for all those
variables so again
did i have a conversation to you about
vaccinations
did that just happen no it didn't
 happen
there was nothing in this conversation
of vaccinations it was just the context
for analyzing correlation versus
causation
i i asked this uh
this twitter poll just to
find out how many people are deeply in
cognitive distance
this gun is finally waking up
on locals
locals i'm going to give you one warning
the next time you tell me i'm
just waking up i'm going to kick you off
the platform now i know it's a
subscription platform
but that's not allowed
i'm telling you that's my limit
if you tell me that i'm waking up when
my opinion is exactly the same
as it's always been
i'm gonna ban you from the subscription
platform
right now i've never banned anybody from
locals before
but that's over the line all
right
don't
don't mischaracterize my opinion in
front of other people
right you can do it by yourself all day
long
but don't do it in public not right in
front of me
don't mischaracterize my opinion right
in front of me
in public
i will ban your ass from even a
subscription service right
um
am i having a rough rough morning based
on uh low news
uh maybe
anyway so i asked this question if you
knew and this is the key part if you
knew that a shot had a strong chance of
minimizing your illness and maximizing
your survivability
but had no impact on transmission
so you knew it wouldn't stop people from
getting it it wouldn't stop you from
getting it
but you did know and remember this is
hypothetical because nobody knows
anything
nobody knows anything
so it's purely hypothetical
if you could know
if you could know
which you can't but if you could know
that it would uh keep you from getting
sick would you say it's useless or
useful
and 30 said it's useless
even the way i even the way i limited
the question
30 of the people were not willing to
admit
that if something's useful it's useful
think about that
i basically said
here's another way i could have said the
question
if something is useful
is it useful
thirty percent said no
thirty percent said if something's
useful is not useful
because they needed to be right
right which is what i was trying to
discover again it's not about
vaccinations
right this has nothing to do with
vaccinations it's just can you think
can you handle a hypothetical question
because people keep telling me that it's
useless and then in the arguments people
said but but but
but you don't know
exactly you don't know
but if you did know
and somehow people can't handle if you
did know it's like too hard
what's wrong with that
i don't
um
did you hear that there's a huge spike
in deaths
in all categories of people
and not covered related in other words
it's not just covadas but there's
allegedly
and i by the way i don't believe this is
necessarily true
but there's at least one insurance
company and one expert who claims to see
some
that claims to have seen some military
data
excuse me
and allegedly
allegedly people in all categories are
dying at a higher rate
now what could explain that do you think
that the only explanation is that the
vaccinations themselves
which you call shots
are killing people
is that the only explanation or is it
even the best explanation what do you
think
could be
but we would agree it could be right
so we can't rule it out here are the
other things you can't rule out
you can't rule out long covet
because how many of those people who
died
had covet
and you know maybe they got over it
maybe they didn't have any antibodies
but maybe they had some
long covet
i don't know i don't even know if long
covenant is real
again it's stuff we don't know
i'm seeing a good
a good idea here in the comments
how do you know it wasn't climate change
ah
that was a pretty good comment by the
way it wasn't mine i wish i'd said it
why why is this not climate change huh
huh
if everything else that's bad is driven
by climate change why is it this step
okay it's probably not
here's another possibility
have you walked outside and looked
around at all
at people
do people look a little bit different
than they used to say two years ago
have you noticed anything about people
that looks different
how about people are 20 to 40 pounds
heavier than they were two years ago
it's hugely obvious
no pun intended
is it not obvious when you
walk outside it's obvious right
there's just been a gigantic increase in
obesity
could the increase in obesity which one
imagines crosses every demographic group
and age
could that
be related to
life expectancies because obesity is one
of the biggest variables
in
longevity and so since we know one of
the biggest
levers for longevity has been moved a
lot
why wouldn't we go to that as the
obvious
isn't huge weight gain the most obvious
thing that's happening why it's not even
in the options set
we're not even considering that
possibility
all right here's another thing that i'm
getting pissed off about
can we stipulate
can we stipulate that 100 of the people
who are smart enough
to own a device that they could turn on
and watch this thing
can we all stipulate that 100 of you
know that the shots
were
presented as something that would stop
transmission but they do not
can we all just stipulate that because
if you keep telling me that over and
over again i don't know how many times i
can agree with you
you're wearing me down
can we just stop saying the obvious
stuff there's a lot of vaccinations
stop calling in a vaccination we all
know that
a hundred percent of the world knows
that there's not a person in the
world who doesn't know that the
vaccinations are not vaccinations really
so if i use the wrong word
can you let it go
can you let that go maybe
just let it slide a little bit
all right and then there's people who
said
scott your question was unfair
because you did not include the risk of
the shot itself to which i say that's
correct i did also not include the risk
of long coven or coven itself
these are all unknowns
and
you all have to guess
we all have to guess because they're all
unknowns
let's just move on to the monkey box
people
you know i cannot get excited about a
national problem
that i can avoid simply by not having a
penis in my ass
or vice versa i guess
and
i don't mean to be crude
but has there ever been a problem that's
easier to avoid
like
avoiding covet
was kind of hard you didn't know where
it was it's like where is this cove it
could be anywhere where's the combat
hiding i think there's some in the air
i don't know
but
if you were to make a list of all the
types of disasters
let's make a list
we've got your hurricanes
we've got your climate change disasters
we've got your fires your nuclear wars
you've got your smaller less nuclear
wars you got your ukraine's got a let's
see we've got
700
really bad
global problems
and then one of them is monkey box
could you check which of these national
problems you would most like to to have
i say nuclear war
yeah i don't want that
covad no i don't do not want a coven
pandemic no inflation
no no inflation
racism
get rid of that racism i don't want that
oh
hello monkey box
we'll read a little bit about you uh
monkey box well if you get it it looks
it's pretty bad okay that's bad uh what
would i have to do to avoid
getting the monkey pox
okay
uh do not put your erect penis inside a
man's buttocks
i could do that i could do that
additionally avoid
letting another man put his erect penis
into your anal cavity i can do that
i can do that
i can do that
this is my favorite disaster of all time
my god
now if i were gay
to be fair
this would be harder
i'm not sure i could avoid it entirely
if i were gay but since i'm not
if i had to choose
selfishly i mean
selfishly
i think i'd pick that one
so that's your sign of the golden age
when you can avoid a
global problem just by keeping stuff out
of your ass basically
all right um
[Applause]
what else
god there was just nothing happening
today
nothing happened
rectum
that's a joke
uh
shouldn't it be easy to avoid random
partners
if if the gay community just stayed
monogamous for a month
would the whole problem go away
now you're probably not allowed to say
that right
because that that demonizes a group of
people
let me be as clear as possible
i'm not demonizing anybody that would be
a victim group
all right if if if men who have sex with
men as we like to say
if that's the group with the most
impact
then i'm not demonizing them
i'm i feel empathy because i wouldn't
want to be in that group and have that
risk
so i have empathy but let's keep it in
perspective
yeah it just recognizes that some
behaviors have more risk for this
particular activity
our particular
what it what is monkey pox is it
a disease
what do you call it what's the right
word for monkey box a condition
a disease
a virus
just called a virus an std
infection
all right let's call it an infection
well yes obviously it's a problem of
it's not a problem for monogamous
couples yes that's true
what do you think
what do you think about the fact
that some states will ban abortions
and i guess indiana has a pretty
complete ban
at the same time
it looks like it will be somewhat i'm
not going to say easy
but people who want abortions will
probably be able to find resources
for free
would you be happy the only thing that
happened to the abortion rate
is that it became less convenient
still the same amount of abortions would
you be okay with that
i mean would you say that that was a
victory
somebody says friction works but is it
the friction you want
do you want the friction to be
that the people least able to get an
abortion
are the ones who don't get it is that
the friction you want in society
i don't know if that's a productive
friction it might
it might keep
you know more babies coming full term if
that's if that's your objective
uh
oh it's allowed for incessant rape and
health are you saying that the indiana
law allows
for those special
cases is that true
okay
well that helps
you know
i try to stay out of the abortion
question because
i'm
a man who does not have babies
but
i'll tell you one thing that
i can have a solid opinion on
if i were if i were a woman
and if i
got pregnant as a result of a rape
i would want to kill both the rapist and
whatever was inside me
i'd want to kill that thing so badly
and i'd want i'd want it dead
like deader than dead i wouldn't care
that it was half me but that's just me
that's just me
yeah and i i'm not in the position of
anybody who's in that who could have
that risk so you should
you should ignore my opinion
can we all agree on that
can we all agree that
my speculative opinion of what i would
do if i were in that condition should be
ignored by all of you as no
has no impact on the real world
so i'm just saying that if somebody else
had that opinion
i would certainly respect it
i would respect it
but i would also respect anybody who
makes a a considerable decision about
abortions
you know
i i feel like i would respect anybody
who put real thought into it
wherever they come down
uh
you're disappointed in my economics
understanding
i taught you about friction you're just
you're just parroting back the things i
that i tell you
of course friction would would give you
less of it
of course it would
but
are you really going to see friction
imagine that you have these two worlds
let's let's take indiana one is that
somebody gets pregnant and let's say
they're
the only way they can get an abortion
is to figure it out themselves right
they've got to go to wherever you get
them and you go get one now let's say
that changes
to you have to take a bus ride for six
hours but somebody else is paying for it
and somebody else is holding your hand
through the process
it wouldn't be worse
wouldn't be worse it might be an extra
day or two
but for something that important i don't
know if the extra day or two would make
that much difference to your planting
there would be some friction so it would
reduce the amount you're right
they might not continue to do it
don't know
society will never value life if the
most vulnerable among us isn't
considered worthy of protection
um
we already don't protect them
i mean that's our normal situation is we
don't protect the most vulnerable
stop using it as a birth control method
yeah
all right i don't think there's anything
else happening today so
um i think i'm going to call it college
short
and we'll get to some other things and
get on another day
maybe i'll be less grumpy tomorrow
bye for now
