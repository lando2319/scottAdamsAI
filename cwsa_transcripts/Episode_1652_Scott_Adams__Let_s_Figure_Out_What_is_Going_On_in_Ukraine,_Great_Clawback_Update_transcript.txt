[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of your entire life it's
called coffee with scott adams
um that's what i call it you are free to
call it anything you want
and
the doctor is always late
so you wait a few minutes
what's the problem
hey how would you like to enjoy the
simultaneous
sip to the truckers
and uh all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
sugar flask a festival of any kind fill
it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day the thing
that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and if
you don't think this makes your life
better i feel sorry for you go
here's a question i asked myself
if you take a history class in america
do you ever get two books with two
different histories
like here's the history of the civil war
oh and then here's the other book with
the alternate history of the civil war
that doesn't really happen does it
but
do you think that during the time of
those events there was only one
interpretation
i don't know
do you think it's always been true that
there are two completely separate
interpretations of what's happening at
the moment
it could be worse now but maybe not and
i'm wondering if
uh the
the consensus of history is the only
place that the two movies become one
so here's the one that i'm tracking
in the case of covet everything
everything you know happened kind of
quickly and within a couple years there
so we got to see you know
weird things happen quickly
and one of the weird things was how
quickly two complete
interpretations of what was happening
were living side by side
the weirdest one that's happening now is
happening to the right
this will make you a little
uncomfortable i know
but there's a large group of people who
are smart
influential
you know engaged people who know a lot
so this is just a complete compliment
people who are
really high qualified
thinkers
who are saying out loud
that because we're doing things or the
governments are loosening up and and
have some different opinions about how
to handle the panda pandemic now
that that's what they should have done
from the beginning
now
does that make any sense to any of you i
want to see if anybody else is is
experiencing that movie
who is experiencing the movie
that because of the way we're acting now
loosening up with the pandemic etc
that that's the way we should have acted
in the beginning you know just letting
everybody
do whatever they wanted
so somebody says after the first two
weeks it didn't make sense
um we see i see some yeses all right so
there are enough yeses here to say
can we without arguing who is right or
wrong
can we conclude that there that's a very
different interpretation
it's pretty sticky too
now
but at the same time that you believe
that
you also understand that all of the
variables are different right
so if it's true that we should have
always acted the same
that could be true
but it would be true that we should have
acted the same no matter what the
variables were
that that's actually
could be could be a reasonable view
that whether millions of people were
dying or not dying you'd sort of act the
same because freedom is more important i
suppose
so that you can make that argument
but
but
can you make the argument that the
people who
change their opinion because all the
variables changed are therefore
irrational because they change their
opinion
does it make sense to mock people for
changing their view
when all of the variables changed like a
lot
does it
but it looks like that's going to happen
all right
so at some point we will guess i have
one world view
but i don't know which one it will be
i think the one world view will be
whether this is true or not
i think the consensus of history
will be the vaccine vaccination worked
again i'm not saying it's true
because i know i don't want to argue any
of that stuff right now
i'm just saying that i think history
will say vaccinations worked they helped
get through the pandemic
the side effects were minimal
and that it was a great victory of
governments or something i think it's
going to look like that
and then probably something about
omicron finishing it off
but
speaking of many worlds
do you have any idea what's happening in
ukraine
how many of you think you understand the
ukraine situation
like you know the basics that putin is
amassed an army
might go in there
but isn't it is it all just sort of
confusing and
do you feel that you're
let's say your mainstream media entities
do you think that they've explained to
you what's going on
so i did a little bit of uh you know
that thing that i say is ridiculous
doing your own research
i always mock
doing your own research because nobody's
smart enough to know if they're looking
at the right research
i don't know i can read a lot of stuff
but i don't know if it's true
so let me tell you some of the things
that i've found
without a
let's say without much of an opinion
about what's true
all right
so the ukraine story has at least two
completely different movies
one movie is the one we get in the
united states
and that movie is that putin is an
aggressive tyrant
he wants to control neighboring
countries and control everything
and
and that everything that you see putin
do
is because he's sort of an expansionist
dictator and wants to control everything
so that's our view would you say that's
sort of what you're hearing
does that sound pretty close
and that
what we're trying to do is hold the line
and make sure that putin doesn't get any
progress so that nato looks like it's
strong yeah that it's a nato
sort of a related issue
now how many of you know
that there's one narrative that the
united states staged a coup in ukraine
in 2014
or was behind the coup
or revolution depending on who you're
talking to
and
how many of you know that ukraine went
from more
of a russia puppet
to more of an american puppet because of
this mysterious
coup
basically we took ukraine from putin
didn't we
am i wrong
can is there somebody who knows more
about this stuff that i do who can
who could validate the claim
that the united states probably
probably
took ukraine from putin's control
but you don't hear that do you
have you ever heard cnn say that
now i believe that's an unproven
allegation
meaning that we don't know that the cia
or the u.s was really behind it
but it sort of looks like a hillary
thing doesn't it
it sort of looks hillary-ish
uh for sure
so
and who knows when that was started so
now we've got this
highly corrupt government but at least
it's less pro-putin
so that would look good
how many know that
nato wants to put a bunch of missiles in
ukraine
did you know that we want to put
missiles in ukraine that's right on now
i think they're defensive missiles
but they don't have to be right
i mean
initially they might be defensive
but what do you think russia should do
about
nato having 12 000 troops on their
border
and 22 fighter jets sort of in that
general region not not all of nato
that's just in the
closest to the border of russia i guess
and
so we we've got this situation and
can you be sure
you know which way would be in your
benefit
if it went
in other words you watching this
do you know if you would be better off
or whatever country you're watching from
if russia
attacked or if they didn't
do you know
you kind of assume that any war is bad
right
but i'll bet it's not bad for everybody
because no wars are there's always
somebody who gets rich in the war
and so
one of the questions i'd ask myself that
i haven't seen anybody
deal with in the media
is that would
russia be economically advantaged or
disadvantaged if they conquered
ukraine militarily and tried to hold it
what do you think
what's your common sense tell you
such as it is
that
would russia be better off or worse off
for owning ukraine again but if they had
to hold it militarily
better off or worse off
i'm seeing mixed mixed opinions
worse off worse off better off
i don't know to me it looks really
expensive because i heard one analyst
say that russia that might not even have
the money to keep their
army massed on the border for long
it's so expensive to move an army
that just having a hundred thousand
soldiers and all the support staff
on the border in case they want to
attack
might be too expensive
so one of the strategies that the u.s
might be pursuing
is to see how long we can make them wait
because the longer they wait the more
bankrupt they go russia that is
so it should be to our advantage even if
we think they're definitely going to
invade to just delay it as long as
possible because it's so expensive
and i'll bet we're spending you know
pennies on the dollar compared to them
because we're not putting much of an
active
defense in ukraine
so when you hear russia say
you know it's almost like the u.s has
tried to create a
you know a fake reason for russia to
invade you know first you laugh that off
and then you say to yourself well we
really don't know what's going on could
it be
that you could destroy russia and
putin's influence by letting him take
ukraine
that's possible isn't it
don't you think that ukraine could be a
big enough problem to putin that it
would suck up all of his resources
what
how strong is the russian army today
when they have
so much of their resources in one place
weakened i would think
so i don't understand how this uh
this entire chessboard works but i'll
give you a few more uh points of view
from this
one point of view is that russia's
russia is on a roll and putin's on a
roll
so they would say well he he won in
syria
he took over crimea
apparently he recently effectively took
over a belarus
which was more of a
ambiguous situation
so it would look
as if everything that putin does he's
getting away with
so he's growing his influence he's maybe
protecting his borders maybe he's
you know maybe he's rebuilding the
greatness of russia
but then
is that the only thing he wants
what do you think putin actually wants
and why don't we know
do you think he's do you think this is
mostly defensive or mostly offensive
here's my take on it
that russia's only asset is energy and
military
am i right like basically it's a it's a
two variable country
energy and military
if we if we could put offensive weapons
in ukraine
it would basically make their military
almost useless
because if you if you had you know let's
say
nuclear
missiles
that could reach moscow in 10 minutes
it wouldn't matter what kind of army
russia had
they would be completely vulnerable at
any size
so we're looking to completely neuter
the power of russia's one of their two
assets and maybe due to their second one
which is get rid of that pipeline
so if russia attacks
that's probably going to give us reason
to put
more missiles wherever we can get them
which might not be ukrained but it would
give us a pretext to move more missiles
in on his border
it would be hugely expensive it would
bog down his army it would be
pr wise a disaster it would be a
hitler-like look
and
um and then we could obviously put up
these sanctions on and get back in the
energy business and get putin out of it
which would be expensive but it could
happen
so i have a feeling that the u.s has a
view that if russia attacks
it would be the worst thing for russia
of all time
it would be walking right into a trap
that we want which is an economic trap
you don't want to walk into an economic
trap when you think you're having an
army or if you think you're having a war
if russia thinks this is a kinetic war
and the u.s thinks it's an economic war
who's going to win
who's going to win if russia thinks it's
a real war and the u.s thinks it's a
economic trick we're going to trick them
into spending all their money and
bankrupting themselves
i feel like i would bet on the economic
war
some of the things that moscow is
demanding like you know reduction of
forces on nato
and you know not letting other countries
in and getting rid of missiles and all
that stuff
wouldn't we ask for the same thing
if russia had assets in cuba or mexico
or something
wouldn't we ask for exactly the same
thing
it's kind of weird that we don't see
that as a reasonable thing to ask for
um
you know i i threw out this idea that
was shot down quickly on twitter but i
think i can defend it better there
should be something called a switzerland
option
for any country that's
in ukraine situation
meaning that it could let me just
suggest what this would look like now
switzerland is famously neutral so it
doesn't get attacked but as often people
point out it doesn't seem to have
strategic value it's got mountains it's
got an armed militia
it's not a threat to anybody
it's a good place to park your illegal
dictator money so there are lots of
reasons that the switzerland is not like
any other place
so don't get too don't get too hung up
on the switzerland comparison
the only part of the comparison is could
you create
new neutral countries with different
sets of why they're neutral you know
different than switzerland but could you
create
like a a neutral country that was never
neutral before
well here's how i would do it
i would create a process within the
united nations
in which a country could but maybe only
with unanimous support
you know you or something close to
unanimous let's say every country in the
world says you know
this country is going to be nothing but
trouble so whoever controls it is going
to put missiles there
that's bad so how about nobody controls
it
and you get literally every country in
the united nations to declare it neutral
once it's declared neutral
then every country in the world also has
the responsibility
to stop doing business with
anybody who attacks it
because at this point you can't be shut
off from all economics in the world and
expect to survive you turn into north
korea
so i would think that you could create a
neutral country out of anything
no matter how vulnerable they are no
matter how strategic
i think you could make any country
neutral
as long as every country agreed to cut
off the finance
finance operations of anybody who
attacked it
no i'll just put that out there
don't know if it'd work but if you don't
try you never know
i saw a military expert say that if
russia attacks ukraine it would
be signaled by a massive cyber attack
so they'd do a cyber attack first
to which i said to myself
if russia did a massive cyber attack
would the united states not learn how
russia does massive cyber attacks
and would that not be pretty useful for
us to know
likewise
if russia invaded would it not be using
modern equipment and modern techniques
which would be very revealing
and useful for nato to understand
is it possible
that we are luring russia into a war to
figure out how they fight
or at least partly you know i don't
think any anything is being done for one
reason
i think i think things are done for you
know a basket of reasons but i wonder if
that's one of them
to learn to learn the russian military
secrets in a way that we couldn't have
seen in syria for example
so
i don't know now another possibility is
that we think we could actually stop
them if they if they attacked
because we don't know what weapons
ukraine has right
i don't think that we advertise the good
stuff
i think we advertise the you know stuff
that they would have known about anyway
but if but if ukraine has some kind of
you know amazing let's say
small i just i like to use this example
but if they have some amazing capability
with these small drones
that each one can let's say be a suicide
attacker on a tank or something
it could be
that we think we can give russia a black
nose sufficient that
it wouldn't it would stall it forever
for any future provocations
so who knows what everybody's thinking
and i don't think that there's one set
of view anywhere about this i think that
they're probably in the cia
let me let me toss this out here
i'm i'm continuously wondering why the
u.s and russia have any conflict at all
except that it's historical like they're
always doing things to us so we always
do things to them vice versa forever
and how much do you think it matters
that the cia
is presumably
fairly stocked with people who
understand russia but not much owns
am i right
what would happen if the caa had a bunch
of russia experts
but um
they had fewer experts in other
countries
wouldn't the cia be obsessed with russia
simply because that's what their staff
is
it's just a bunch of people trained in
that you know that area of espionage
so could it be that all of our problems
have to do with staffing in
both russia's secret services and ours
and that they're simply staffed with a
bunch of
russia fighters in one and
cold war warriors in the other
and that if you just did some employee
reorganization you know maybe some
forced retirements or something you'd
get a whole different world
because it does seem to me that if you
were a russia expert you would need to
drum up some
russia problems wouldn't you
you would have to create some russia
problems so that you have the greatest
career opportunity
so it seems to me we've created a
business model
where our cia
should want wars with russia because
they have a bunch of russia experts on
their staff
and they'll all get promotions if it's
there's a russia conflict
i worry about that
the weirdest thing about this is that
the russia ministry ministry of foreign
affairs
so they're saying that uh the western
countries are spreading a large-scale
disinformation campaign
about an allegedly impending russian
invasion of ukraine
quote in order to divert attention from
their own aggressive actions
is that true
do you think that russia put a hundred
thousand forces on the border
and and knows that everybody knows that
and they're willing to stay in public
still with a hundred thousand forces
amassed on the ukraine border that are
obviously offensive forces
or so we were told
are they really telling the world that
they're there for no reason
is russia really trying to tell us
that they put a hundred thousand forces
there
no reason
or are they saying they're defensive
because nobody's suggesting we're
attacking russia
so here's the question to you
how do you know they have a hundred
thousand forces there
and why didn't somebody ask them that
question
do you don't you don't think we can get
to the russian foreign ministry guy and
ask him a question
i think he's pretty available
why don't we ask him the question
do you in fact have massive forces give
them some numbers 100 000 or so on the
border of ukraine yes or no
and is that unusual
are they normally there
because
i'd just love to see him deal with the
question because what if he says no we
don't
what if he said that
what if he said no we don't have massive
troops on the border
how do you know it's true that we do
how do you know it's true that we do
i don't
i mean i've believed it because it seems
to be coming from multiple sources
but is it
do you think that do you think that
there are multiple news sources that can
all have
they'll have uh you know visibility
i don't think so no i realize that
there's there's satellite imagery right
but doesn't everything that we know come
from our military
am i wrong
do we know anything independently
can can we use our private satellites to
look down on them anytime we want
so i guess i have a question if
our news sources can see anything
independently and know what it is
or are we just taking the word of our
military
at this point you can't trust anything
can you
i would have to think that
it's too big of a claim to be false
although weapons of mass destruction in
iraq was a pretty big claim
james webb knows you say well ask him
what what's going on there
um
all right uh there's a bob saga update
that is not too far from what i
speculated so apparently his head injury
was massive
he looked like you know somebody had uh
i guess his head was so cracked it was
like somebody hit him with a battery we
had a you know fall from a large height
or something but somehow he got in bed
and do you remember my speculation
you remember my speculation that
he probably was not thinking right or he
was so tired he could just barely get
into bed and
and he was he was probably at that point
you know dis disoriented so at this
point
and i i said that before the doctors
right
you heard me say that that
probably what happened was he was
disoriented and
didn't know who he was by the time he
got in bed
and it's starting to look like that's
exactly what happened they're still
ruling out drugs
although apparently he had klonopin in
them
so he had klonopin in them but they're
ruling out drugs
i'm not sure how you can do that
that that would that would be a
i don't know
i think you'd have to speculate just
because you didn't see a direct
connection but i don't know how you
could rule it out as being a factor
certainly the drugs didn't kill them i
think that's what they're saying but
what if you took drugs and they they led
to your
you know i don't
whatever fall or situation
possible
and
i don't know i don't think we're going
to find out if there was any uh
crime involved there but i guess we'll
keep watching there's a report of a
mysterious hum around the world that
affects two percent of the population
did you know that
how many of you hear a mysterious hum
in your own home
i was looking for one this morning and
then there was a news story on it i was
literally trying to figure out why
there's a new
loud hum in my house i still haven't
found it
i have a theory but i haven't confirmed
it yet
yeah i don't think it's tinnitus because
it's only in one room
yeah in your garage
yeah apparently it's a pretty big
problem around the world mysterious hums
well let's talk about the truckers
my favorite thing about this story is
how cnn covers how fox covers the
truckers
so cnn is trying to paint the truckers
as you know criminals and racists and
nerdwells or whatever they're doing
and fox is covering them as patriots and
freedom fighters
so cnn has to insult fox for how they
cover the truckers
so
i
i have a question about the uh
our trade with canada
and i don't mean to insult our
canadian uh
friends
but those trucks have been blocking
things for a while
i'm not noticing anything missing
have you
is there something mysterious about this
story number one
we can't get any goods across the border
by trucks
story number two
except for the specific case of the
automotive industry which is having a
problem
why do i not have any trouble getting
anything else
is it
now i know we have airplanes and rail
travel and stuff like that
but
aside from the car factories
is it just that we have less maple syrup
and milk
it's the milk and the maple syrup right
because i haven't really noticed beef
lumber oh i guess building building
materials is pretty big
somebody somebody says it's because i'm
rich but is it
i know that inflation is killing
everybody so i'm aware of that
beer beer you hoser
all right well
apparently the value of the trade from
canada is largely optional materials
am i wrong that everything we trade with
canada is optional
well i'd like some delicious maple syrup
on my pancakes
but i could eat the donut
i would like
to buy a new car but
my old car will run for a while
i would love a molson
but
you know
heideggen's fine
[Laughter]
i would worry i worry that the canadian
trade is not any essentials whatsoever
and then the i guess the gas and the oil
would be coming in the pipeline so they
wouldn't be affected
yeah there's hockey there's hockey
yeah so i don't want to uh i don't want
to understate the effect they had on the
car companies because that sounds pretty
bad
uh joe rogan broadcast the majeed
experience i don't know what that is
lumber
yeah
end school mandates is that a
that looks like a editorial in the wall
street journal
so
um
is anything happening with mandates
so apparently in california there's
going to be some talk this coming week
about what how to how to turn this into
an endemic which it already is
um joe rogan is winning yeah
um
kyle says doesn't scott know canada is
the number one trading partner with the
u.s kyle
that's my point
thank you for seeing the obvious kyle
yes my point is how in the world is it
not affecting us in a way that like is
really affecting my life
given that canada is a massive trading
partner as is mexico wouldn't you expect
any disruption in a massive trading
partner
to have an immediate effect
right that's the whole point the whole
point is if trade is that big and it's
disrupted why don't i see it
yeah and maybe two weeks is not enough
but given the extent of it
of the interruption you'd expect
i would expect to see it by now
oh there's another bridge an hour to the
north so all it is is an inconvenience
of an hour is that true
or a couple hours
maybe
it seems like that bridge would be
pretty
when is the last time you saw a made in
canada on a label
there's a good
question but you know if you're buying
lumber and
gas you're not going to see a label on
it
um
why didn't covet affect the protesters
if covet is so infectious well i don't
know that it didn't
abc says california still wants mandates
well we still have them so somebody
wants them
and
i do think that the public in california
might be pro mask
by the way where is the super bowl this
year is it in california
who who has the super bowl is it us
la
la really
this is how little i follow sports so i
didn't know the super bowl was in la la
until just this moment
and the first thing that i think to
myself is didn't they pick the worst
place
of the entire country
i you know i guess has to do with the
size of the facility and stuff
but i'm pretty sure they picked the very
worst place in the entire country didn't
they and how long ago did they pick it
because if they picked it once we knew
the pandemic was in place
is selected years ago he has part of a
rotation somebody says okay
well that's bad timing because that was
the very worst place to put it now let
me ask you something
are the omicron olympics still going on
i'm not hearing anything
i have not seen one event
i have i've seen the headlines that i
skipped
the omicron olympics completely
disappeared
am i right
um
one tv at a bar of 20 tvs last night
yeah
yeah we are very aggressively not caring
about the olympics and i'm happy about
that sorry about the athletes but
you know uh you you took a
you took a high risk high-risk path if
you're trying to be an olympic athlete
all right
um
oh there's a tunnel near the bridge as
well okay well all these stories seem to
be
lacking context again
all right so it seems that the the news
is mostly continuation news so there's
just more stuff about the same stuff
we've been talking about so i don't want
to you know belabor it too much does
anybody have a question for me that
you've been
holding on to
because i know that sometimes uh
i create curiosity about either a point
of view or something i said that was
inconsistent maybe
um
weight loss and covid
all right
um
gary says scott the data changed i don't
trust the data i made dilbert too on the
nose
so you're saying that i'm inconsistent
about trusting the data
or not but there's no inconsistent there
i'm saying that the data all changed
that doesn't say that you should trust
it
doesn't mean it was right before or
wrong before i think i'm consistent
there
because nobody nobody's doubting the
data changed
um did you find a mustang yes
successfully it's quite awesome too
the cat's around
the cat unfortunately is not doing too
well
when do you leave in california that's a
wait and see
yeah boo uh boo had a my cat had
operation for
polyps but apparently the operation
didn't work so she's back to her
original bad situation
uh
who came up with february 1st so
greg greg and i sort of
agreed on february 1st
the water leaks i just fixed just fixed
another one
yeah
it was my 13th water leak of the year i
think
um
yeah
all right gary i think i'm gonna get rid
of you just for being a jerk
hide user you're gone
was the mystery ufo related to what
all right um
do i dream of water leaks i haven't
oh how's the book coming yeah i'm
working on a new
a new book i'm just coming along well
cat is still alive
but she's
she's having
problems
snickers is doing well
thoughts on jesse waters new show i need
to spend more time looking at it i've
only seen some clips
i'm sure it's awesome
um
is civil war a possibility now it's not
so
we're nowhere near civil war in the
united states not even close
uh can you elaborate what i mean by the
left is blind to human motivation yeah
so
the right consistently
pursue strategies that understand that
people are selfish and lazy
and if you don't
if you don't give them rewards and
penalties
for doing the right thing they're not
going to do the right thing on their own
it's just that and you could just find
it in a million different ways just pick
it pick anything that
people differ on and it's probably going
to be there
i watch cnn more than msnbc because
msnbc seems
like literally crazy
where cnn just looks like they're lying
but it's obvious
msnbc they look actually crazy
does anybody else have that opinion
cnn doesn't look crazy to me because
it's obvious they're lying
right but you go to msnbc and it's not
obvious they're lying
it looks like they believe what they're
saying and that's a whole different
level of
messed up
now
of course i can't read their minds so
maybe they're all thinking exactly the
same thing i can't tell but
it does look like the cnn people know
they're
it does look like that i don't know
but that you know it's just subjective
about the 2000 mules what did my sources
say about the 2000 mules so remember we
talked about that uh
um
the story or the allegation that there
was a bunch of ballot stuffing and that
there were specific mules that went to
ballot box after bell box have you
noticed that story just sort of died
i guess it just couldn't get traction
for
and the reason would be i can't imagine
that the sources were shown yeah i think
de souza was spent uh behind some of
that
or all of it i don't know
but wasn't the whole question everybody
saw it and said wow if you can show
sources for that that's really good and
i haven't heard any sources
so i guess it might be a way to see if
there are sources then that's a whole
new ballgame if they're not then it's
just one of those things
um
did the actual film come out yet maybe
yeah maybe that's what we're waiting for
is the film to come out
um the room with the hum doesn't have
any difference in
fluorescent lighting
that it had before
are you sad today nope
no
um i'm just not excited by anything
today because the news wasn't that
interesting
could the hum be a sonic weapon makes
you wonder i don't think the hubs are
damaging anybody though
um
best show ever i think so yeah
a germ or terrain theory um i don't know
about that
the desantis slaughter meter i saw there
was a story about his wife talking about
her
cancer
about their future i didn't read the
article
but is there anything that would keep
desantis from
running for president besides trump
i think it's just down to trump isn't it
how old are the lights with on newish
oh the hum stopped
hold on
yeah it stopped
i
i'm not that far away from a uh a gravel
mixing factory
and i think it's that actually
all right
couldn't the blockchain be used for
elections i think so but i don't know
um
can trump afford another run i don't
think so
elon lost 40 satellites in a solar storm
really
wow
why are you not angry about no election
integrity
are you kidding
has anybody not heard me go off time and
time again about
uh not having an audible election
that's like one of my top things i
scream about
from the most recent launch okay
wow 40 satellites
how vulnerable is civilization to a
coronal mass
ejection
[Music]
i don't know
you know i spend not a lot of time
worrying about the sudden destruction of
earth from
unlikely events
because i don't really understand how
we're here in the first place
doesn't seem really weird that humans
have been here for uh
in our modern forum by a hundred hundred
thousand years or something and we all
got lucky that the world is just right
all right
um
are we really in the simulation i think
so
i do think so
um
i think by far it's the most likely
explanation
all right i don't want to talk about
future like disasters
all right i'm gonna go do something else
um
and
i hope all of you have uh
changed your diets based on my hypnotist
diet plan
and
i hope you're all getting happier and
healthier and stronger
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
