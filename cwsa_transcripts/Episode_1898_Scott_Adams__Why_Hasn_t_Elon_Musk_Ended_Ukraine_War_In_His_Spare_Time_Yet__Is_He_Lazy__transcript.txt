good morning everybody and welcome to a
highlight of civilization coffee with
Scott Adams today you may have noticed
I'm uh wearing my Halloween costume
I'll be going as zelenski
it's a it's the easiest costume you
could ever do yeah it's just a t-shirt
but I think I'm killing it
and if you'd like to take this
experience up to stratospheric levels
and I know you do all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea
Steiner canteen jungle or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
is called the simultaneousip that's
right and it happens now go
oh
uh I keep saying Jack uh posabix name
wrong are you telling me
I think some people just have to get
used to the fact that people are going
to say their name anyway
yeah I think if you have some kinds of
names you just have to get used to the
fact yeah people are going to do it any
way they can
so
do we need to talk about Madonna
I feel like
I was going to ignore the whole Madonna
got some plastic surgery didn't look so
good story
but oh my God there's something going on
there that's not good and it's a perfect
example of what happens when somebody
has too much power
first of all she's clearly insane
would anybody doubt that
she she's exhibiting serious mental
problems
and obviously there's nobody who can say
no to her
I mean even her surgeon can't say no to
her
how in the world does anybody intervene
like your children probably have no
power over
this is going to get worse
it's going to get worse and I have no
idea what the problem is
I mean it's just
you know massive mental problems but I
wonder if the pandemic got her I don't
know there's more video of Joe Biden
trying to sniff girls and uh get creepy
with them I don't know if you've seen
the latest but it's just as disturbing
as you think it would be
I don't know if it means anything but
it's creepy
here's my favorite story of the day
reportedly CNN is going to release Jim
Acosta
so Jim Acosta will no longer be with CNN
and also Jim
scuto scuto I guess he had some
accidents and some personal problems
he's working through so he's working
through some personal problems and Jim
Acosta will be gone now
here's the thing
the reporting on the Jim Acosta leaving
as well as the other changes of CNN
correct me if I'm wrong
but CNN is telling us directly
that they didn't used to be real news
am I wrong
am I interpreting too much in there
or would it be is it fair to say
because I obviously I'm biased but but
it seems fair to say that they have now
admitted they did not used to give you
straight news
right so here's my question
what do the people who are watching CNN
admit that they were never real news
what do they think about all the
opinions that they got from CNN
is there any realization that goes on
there do you think I don't think so
you know what I think
I think they say what do you think they
say go ahead
this will be your test to see if you can
anticipate their cognitive distance what
would CNN viewers say if you challenge
them of the fact that is now admitted
and demonstrated that they were not
watching real news
exactly they that they would say well
it's not Fox News
at least is not as bad as Fox News right
that's what they were saying yeah that's
where the that's where the cognitive
dissonance would go now it's not my job
to defend Fox News but there's one thing
that I always say that I think is worth
saying
Fox News does a better job
of distinguishing between their opinion
piece and their news piece
I think I would stick by that statement
I mean if if you see Hannity say
something about Biden don't you just put
it in context
it's Hannity
it's Biden Hannity is going to say bad
stuff about button the same as Acosta
the problem was that Acosta was
pretending to be news
that's not cool
that's not cool at all and I still don't
know what Jake Tapper is supposed to be
now is Jake that is Jake Tapper news or
opinion
I actually don't know and I've watched
him for years what would you say
is he news or opinion
yeah it's a little of both
so you can see what that model would be
confusing
um
so I guess uh
chairman she over there in China opened
up the CCP Summit by announcing that
they have full control of Hong Kong and
Taiwan is next
what
what
Taiwan is next
now there's something strange going on
with China
and it goes like this
the according to Peter Zan and some
other reports
Biden's sanctions have completely
destroyed the tech business in China
completely as in the tech business in
China is just going to have to shut down
because you know he did some sanctions
with I guess some employees who are
American over there they can't be over
there and also be American or something
but here's the thing
why is Peter Zan saying that the entire
Chinese Tech sector just got shut down
like actually just shut down
and it's not in the news
what's going on
look for yourself
how would that not be the biggest story
in the world
if that were true
it would be the biggest story in the
world would it not
what would be a bigger story than that
I can't think of anything now go check
CNN and check Fox News this story
doesn't exist
it's not even the story
so why is one person who I think is
credible I mean I've been told he's
credible
why is one person saying the biggest
thing in the world is happening right
now
and their biggest news sources are
actually ignoring it
who who is lying to us
I can't tell can you
Peter Zane called third out
he fell for a fake
um
okay so I don't so we actually don't
know what's going on here right
there's something gigantic happening
with the news
that we don't we don't really have a
grasp on at all
did you notice that the news is empty
today
just sort of in general
there's no news today
the entire news business just shut down
like like there's something big
happening or coming
is everybody working on something new is
something
I feel like there's some trouble Brewing
or something
is it just me
anyway
um if you were China would you move on
Taiwan now
well if it's true that uh Biden just
shut down your Tech business
aren't you going to have to go get some
chip maker somewhere
did Biden just guarantee that China
would have to conquer Taiwan to take
care of the two
to capture their tech industry
because they just lost their own tech
industry thanks to Biden
right
well what am I missing
because it feels like I I mean I don't
know what China's options are I suppose
I could try to get just get Talent from
other countries or something they could
probably do that but
isn't their incentive to take you know
control of a functioning Tech Center
through the roof because they can't
really be a modern country without it
it's all it's almost a military
requirement now to conquer Taiwan
now I don't know anything about these
you know military issues I'm just the
person who's been right about everything
except except right I was definitely
wrong about uh Russia invading Ukraine
um
so Saturday live I didn't see it but I
read about it it sounded like they were
really dunking on the Democrats for the
January 6th thing being uh being a
boring useless waste of time did anybody
see you Saturday Night Live
and can you if you did could you
characterize it
were they were they unambiguously
mocking the Democrats
or was it balanced
was it balanced
it was negative
I didn't I didn't watch it so I'm asking
you
um yes but without malice
okay yeah so they made fun of the
January 6th thing that's just being bad
theater right
talk about theater
so Nancy Pelosi literally was being
filmed for a documentary while she ran
around trying to look presidential
during January 6. everything about
January 6 looks like a fake
well it doesn't look like it's
completely fake
the the the hearings are all just fake
theater uh our government is no longer a
serious if they ever were they're
certainly not serious about doing the
job of the people
that much is clear
all right here's a story for you a
horrible horrible tragic story
uh there was a 17 year old boy in a New
Miami High School and you will not
believe the horrible thing that happened
to this young man and can we all we'll
probably take a moment of silence after
I read you this horrible horrible tragic
story
this victim this victim
well anyway this poor 17 year old boy
was victimized by a 31 year old
teacher's assistant and softball coach
who this is disgusting but had
she had sex with him multiple times
multiple times
that poor poor boy
now they don't he's underage so they
don't mention what kind of
therapy or medical treatment he is
getting to recover from his amazing sex
but
it can't be easy
can we take a moment of silence for this
poor child this poor 17 year old boy who
while this teacher's assistant and
softball coach was
sucking his he was
probably having one of the worst days of
his life
and I
I think that we need to
really take a moment of silence
okay I think that's long enough yeah
yeah that's good I thank you for that
moment of silence
um all right here's the real question
was the crime
the crime or was the crime the way we
treated the crime
which one was the crime
was the crime all the good sex they had
together because they did it a lot of
times so therefore it couldn't have been
bad
was the crime all the sacks
or was the crime the fact that their
lives will be destroyed because we're
all
which is the crime
is it the crime that a technical
violation occurred
and of course there was you know I mean
usually these are about a power
differential right
I mean even though there's a you know
technically there's an underage boy here
but usually it's about the power
differential
you tell me what the power differential
is of a 17 year old boy versus a
teacher's assistant who's a softball
coach also
are you telling me the assistant teacher
and softball coach had power over the 17
year old boy he was probably a head
taller than her no
not at all
so this is one where we really have to
take a look at ourselves this is not a
story about these two people
this is a story about us sucking
this is this is about everybody but the
two people
it looks like it's a story about these
two people it's everybody but them they
were the only two people who should not
be involved in this story
we suck we are like
just
we are disgusting pieces of
just in case you wondered
in case you wondered who you are
I mean I hate us I hate us because of
this story I really do
now if there was any real damage here
then you know that's different but I
don't think so
I don't think so
all right
so Elon Musk I guess got so much heat
for uh allegedly threatening to turn off
starlink in Ukraine that he tweeted the
hell with it even though starlink is
still losing money and other companies
are getting billions of taxpayers money
we'll just keep funding Ukraine
government for free
it must be nice to be that rich
I would love to be that rich
that you could say ah 20 million a month
screw it I'll just pay the 20 million a
month
attack is a tax write-off
you you can't you can't be a follower of
mine and say stuff like that is a tax
write-off you can't do that
and don't make me stop and explain why
all right I it is a tax write-off but
you don't make money by losing money
um
so then I saw an exchange with kim.com
and Elon Musk where kim.com was you know
encouraging Elon that everybody has to
try to make make peace here
and Elon said he's trying hard but get
nowhere apparently
and let me ask you this
how serious is it
when Elon Musk talks about his own
involvement in trying to end the war
I think it's pretty serious
I think that he actually is
probably at least
20 percent of the equation
yeah I think he would have at least that
much influence he can't do it alone
but if if things were you know maybe
teetering in One Direction I think he
could push it you know I think if it was
on a balance point he could be the
deciding vote you know he he does have
the influence to push things one way or
another but
let us uh game this out number one
uh I saw a
extended uh military explanation of how
Ukraine made such a big gain recently
around Curson
and
was around curbside now but whatever big
game no not around Curson
it was about how they made their recent
big gains
and it turns out that it was a special
case
did you know that
so the the big gains that Ukraine made
were they they made a big gamble
to do what's what's the name of the
military technique where they go in fast
uh and they break through the lines they
create as much chaos and they find out
how much defense there is and then they
Retreat the Thunder Roll yes it's called
a thunder roll
so the Thunder Roll is you take a small
very fast unit with some armor and you
you blaze through the lines and you get
behind the lines and you cause all
confusion and Chaos because then you
know it's hard for them to communicate
and you know there's bullets or at least
there's people on both sides of of
people
so it's supposed to sow confusion
and also find out where you can attack
best and then they go in and attack
now
the requirement for that to work is as
follows you have to have a thin
defensive line
thin defensive line because otherwise
the fast unit can't break through it
because they would reach you know a
level and then there'd be another level
then there'd be another level and they
couldn't do anything fast and the the
speed is what makes this work
so
if you thought
that Ukraine's massive unexpected
victory
you know recently a few weeks ago if you
thought that was the beginning of them
rolling up the rest of those areas and I
wondered if that was true too
it turns out they don't have that
special case anywhere else
because this the part of what made it
work is they faked Russia into
fortifying a different place
but now they would have to attack that
different place
and that place does have defensive lines
so it doesn't mean that Ukraine won't
succeed
it does mean they can't do it the same
way and almost certainly not as fast
right
so now I wouldn't say that this either
is the final word and now we know
everything is going to happen right but
it is true that whatever we saw up to
this point does not tell you what
happens next
so
let's game this out
when was the last time you heard a uh a
report from the war
I I haven't heard one in a few days
nothing important right some stuff blows
up but nothing important like no it
doesn't seem like any territory has
changed sides right in a few days
I don't know that it will
I don't know that it will but they're
going to keep fighting
so what happens if no territory is
changing sides and the fighting is
continuing while Putin will continue to
degrade things in Ukraine
but let me ask you this
why why is his degrading of things in
Ukraine sort of muted
in other words it doesn't seem to be in
all day long assault it seems like Putin
you know launches some stuff
and you know destroy some infrastructure
but then they sort of you know next day
they do some more
and the the speculation is that Putin's
out of ammo
and that the reason there's not a
sustained attack on the infrastructure
of Ukraine is they can't do it
he doesn't have enough
accurate missiles and it's the accurate
stuff he needs
right
here's something I ask you
just just if you wonder how gullible you
are to propaganda
here are two facts that are reported in
the war and I never see anybody connect
them and here are the two facts
the Russians are targeting uh
intentionally targeting civilian
residential areas true
or false uh true or false the Russians
are intentionally targeting residential
areas
well the news says that
the news says they're intentionally
targeting residential areas
how could that not be true
all right here's the other thing that
the news says the rut the Russian
missiles and artillery are not accurate
true
or false the Russians have some accurate
stuff but most of it is the inaccurate
stuff
so the news is telling you two things
they're intentionally targeting these
residential areas
and their weapons are super un you know
unaccurate inaccurate
pick one right
now it could be that they're
intentionally targeting residential
areas I'm not
I'm not poo pooing that because there's
some history of that you know some say
that is the the Russian
uh military Doctrine
but I think that's not the military
Doctrine to use when you're attacking
your own countrymen is it
I mean it would be one thing to be
attacking the chechens or somebody who
doesn't look like you you know what I'm
talking about
but the ukrainians and the Russians they
look like each other I don't know I
don't know if you want to destroy all
the residential areas in Ukraine and
then hope to live together in harmony
is that going to happen
I don't know
so here's what I think is going to
happen
the fighting in Ukraine will continue
for a while and there'll be some Horrors
and tragedies and but nothing's going to
happen
there won't be any major changing of
hands
maybe a little bit but not any
you know large-scale changing of hands
at that point
it's also going to look like the only
way that would happen is if America
massively increased the military assets
of Ukraine
which I don't think we'll do at least
not enough for them to capture the rest
of those territories
um
or it could be it could be that we have
some intelligence that says the Russians
are just going to run out of assets
I mean it could be that the Russians
just run out of stuff and they just
can't defend it anymore
so what do you think is going to be more
likely
permanent
um permanent uh nothing nobody goes
anywhere or do you think Russia will run
out of stuff
because I think they would run out
before we would run out
because it looks like there's no end to
how much we're willing to borrow to give
them
so
my prediction Remains the Same
that there will be no genuine peace
talks until there's a genuine nuclear
threat
now you can say we already have a
nuclear threat but I would say no we
don't
no we have talk
so far we just have talk
I don't actually feel the threat yet do
you
I mean I feel that it could become a
threat and that's very real so I'm not
saying there's nothing real there
I'm saying that I don't feel it yet
and I also don't think that you Ukraine
or Russia or the United States feels it
yet
but we will
I think there is no way that we don't
get to the brink of nuclear war
I what would stop it
there's no way that they're going to
just stop and make a peace deal
right
does anybody think that Russia is on the
verge of making a peace deal
no
no not unless things are much worse
there than we think which is possible
it's possible the things in Russia are
much worse than we think because these
things can you know they can have a
Tipping Point where everything looks
good until it doesn't we could be really
close to the Tipping Point in Russia
but you don't know you could also not be
anywhere near it
yeah so
the most likely outcome is it will go to
the brink of nuclear war and then get
serious
uh but how in the world would they ever
decide who owns those disputed
territories
I say that the future is uh pretty much
written already
and the future is that neither Russia
nor Ukraine is going to be able to own
those territories
that's what I say because it's the only
thing that could work
it would make both countries unhappy
it would make both countries unhappy
but it's better than the alternatives
because the alternative is they just
keep fighting forever because nobody's
going to win and if they won the other
side would just shell them forever or be
a terrorist nightmare
yeah I'm surprised anybody lives there
five ukrainians yeah it would be like
five little ukrainians but if they were
demilitarized
um that could work
because I don't see any argument for why
each of those disputed little
territories should have its own military
because it wouldn't have a military that
could defend against either Ukraine or
Russia on its own
so there's no point in having any
military at all
they can't win any wars they're not
going to discourage anybody
uh
yeah would you live there I would not
all right so I think somebody some third
party like the U.N or somebody's gonna
have to step in and uh run those
disputed territories and there's no
other way it can go
so that's my that's my prediction
there's no other way it can go
does anybody want to give me an
alternative prediction
but you have to make the case that it
could go in that direction like it's
actually possible
what would it be
anybody let's see your predictions in
the comments
what do you think
uh
Russia has a substantial arms making
capacity so they can continue making
arms
but that's only until they're you know
anything that requires technology breaks
making weapons requires technology and
their technology structure
were kneecapping so I don't know
uh
all right so so let's take the
alternative possibilities
all right possibility one Ukraine wins
outright
possible or no
and and Russia says ah darn it we tried
but I guess I guess we'll just stop
trying to make war here
I I say that's not likely
so how about Russia wins our right and
Ukraine just says you know
okay you keep these territories
about that
nope no
how about they split them
how about they say well all these
territories are disputed but some of
these lead a little Ukrainian you know
the population does sublease a little
Russian we'll just split them down the
middle and call it good how about that
no I don't think so because I don't
think we have the right leaders that
would get you to that kind of a result
so if neither side can win
militarily or by negotiating
the only thing that's left is that
somebody else is going to have to run
those countries or you have a permanent
war and we're not going to settle for a
permanent War
yeah yeah so
has anybody accept me floated the idea
of somebody who's not Ukraine and not
Russia running those disputed
territories
because it's going to happen
can anybody give me a confirmation as
anybody anywhere
mentioned
you're saying Elon but he didn't do that
did he we wouldn't know about that
but anybody in the public Realm
yeah I don't think Elon Musk Elon said
vote to decide but voting to decide is
deciding you know which of the big
entities you go to
I mean that would work
you know if they have if they had a vote
that was credible
if they had a vote that was credible
yeah
but that still gives you a winner and a
loser doesn't it
suppose you were Russia and you already
knew which way that people would vote I
don't know which way would they vote
actually but suppose you do you knew it
was going to go the other way
would you agree to the vote see here's
the problem with the vote
here's the problem with the vote
probably both Russia and Ukraine think
they know which way the vote would go
I think the vote would only work if you
genuinely didn't know which way the vote
would go
does anybody agree with that
would you agree with the statement that
no one will agree to a vote if you know
which way it's going to go because that
means one one side is agreeing to lose
who would agree to lose
so I think they can't do that I think
they have to do so I think they have to
create a situation in which they both
don't know the outcome
and that will be vital to the outcome
you have to you have to genuinely not
know how it's going to turn out and
that's why having a third party run it
until they get up on their feet and you
know decide who they want to be
I think that's the only way to go
I think
so that's my prediction so my prediction
is that uh
um today I'm the only person talking
about those disputed territories being
independently run
and
I I predict that in a month
it will be a common topic does anybody
want a bat
in a month it will be a common topic
that one of the options is some kind of
an independent
country situation
what do you say
possible
just the conversation I'm not I'm not
saying it's going to happen in a month
I'm going to say that that conversation
will be a common conversation in a month
all right we'll see
um
I'm really curious whether Biden really
did end the Chinese Tech sector and that
the news decided not to report it
like I don't know what's going on today
that is really confusing
all right
um
and what do you think Elon Musk should
do with starlink
do you think musk just needs to run
starlink and let it go now one thing
that uh is worth mentioning
do you have any idea how much money he
can make on starlink
once that's all up and working
do you have any idea
how much money Starling could make it's
a replacement for the whole internet
basically
or at least the transmission part
people
yeah why can't they get paid like
everyone else
I'll call it a mistake
but uh you made the mistake of giving it
to him for free before he signed a deal
and if you do that then people say oh
why should I sign the deal I'm getting
the milk for free
it only works with a stationary
reception right you see a little dish
that's true so it's never gonna
so that by definition that means it's
never going to be in a car
right
so your car will never be able to hone
in on the satellites
there's so many of them though it can't
automatically find one I know
it works for mobile platforms somebody
says it's on boats
oh there is a mobile device okay
so so some here are saying it is mobile
and some are saying not
he has a flat version
all right you could put a receiver in
the car
all right
yeah you know I would be worried if I
were Elon Musk
I don't think he wants to be in a
position that he's the one who caused a
piece
if it's one that one side doesn't like
uh the laser inter-satellite links are
turned on okay
now
uh
is China is with what I'm sorry
monkey brains what
all right
um it's a weird day in the news like I
said because there's just not much
happening there I think I probably won't
go too long today because I don't have
anything else to talk about is there
anything I'm missing
oh here's one thing I wanted to mention
I I was saying today you've seen this a
bunch of times the the list of all the
Trump business failures have you seen
that on the internet I think they're
like 14 or 15 of them or something
and uh this is everything from Trump
Stakes to Trump this and Trump Airlines
and stuff like that
but I don't think people understand that
some number of those businesses were
licensing deals
and the way a licensing deal is if if
that's what they were and I think they
were
if it's a licensing deal then Trump
sells his name
but he's not involved in the business he
just sells his name
so if the business fails Trump still
makes money because he sold his name and
he doesn't have to give it back
so he's not he's not on the hook for any
debt that they cause or anything else
so when I was in doing a lot of
Licensing for Dilbert
um in the in the frothiest time for the
the Dilbert product
licensees were coming from everywhere
and saying can we please give you money
and that's that's that's it
you just have to take our money and then
we can use Dilbert on a product and I
would look at the product and their
their business plan and I would say
there's no way to use it but he's going
to buy that
you know it would be like Dilbert
pajamas and stuff I look at it and say
all right you know you're going to sell
like six Dilbert pajamas
but they were very hard to do it and it
wasn't it wasn't up to me
so they would say can we give you money
and we'll take all the risk and there'll
be no consequence to you
if it doesn't work nobody's even going
to notice just there won't be any
pajamas and so I would take their money
and I would be done
I'd be done there was no more work on my
part I don't even know how the business
goes and then that business fails
well if I were Trump I would get blamed
for that
but why would Trump be blamed for
licensing his name taking his money
putting it in the bank
completely done
and then somebody else's business
doesn't work
licensing
licensing is a business that
at least the kind of license a guy was
in and probably him too
it's the kind of business where most of
the companies should fail
and and the people who are tweeting
these listen rounds don't realize that
Trump was always in the business
uh Trump was always in the business
of high-risk things
that he controlled his downside on
so he had a potentially you know a High
Gain
but he couldn't go any lower than let's
say you know bankruptcy or whatever so
he had a his downside was capped
but his upside wasn't so he kept doing
high-risk things until something paid
off they became president of the United
States
yeah some of the businesses were
definitely his the casinos as as you
mentioned yeah the casinos were his
well I doubt the airline was
somebody to do a fact check was Trump
Airlines a licensing deal
probably was right
some Trump Towers are licensed if not
all
at this point I think at this point
they're probably all licensed but I
don't know
don't know for sure
he owned the airlines
but I'll bet he protected his downside
yeah okay
anyway so I'd like to see a list of
which of those failures were actually
licensing deals which were but in any
case he wasn't managing any of them
we all agree he wasn't managing any of
that right
yeah do you know what the the best
explanation for Trump University was
I gave you this a long time ago
the best explanation for Trump
University is that Trump licensed his
name
and he trusted the people who ran it to
do a right
and they didn't
and and maybe somebody told them about
it but it just wasn't his top priority
and you know maybe he should have
followed up and maybe he should have
done something about it but
if you look at all the things that have
his name on it he couldn't have possibly
managed all that stuff and he couldn't
have possibly been interested in the
details of the those courses do you
think he really looked at the at the
curriculum before he put his name on it
and maybe skimmed it
maybe skimmed it
yeah whether he had an ownership stake
or just a licensing stake in either case
it's very unlikely he knew what was
going on because he had you know too
much of a too much of a business
Enterprise at that point
all right
that's all I got is there anything else
anything I haven't talked about
no I just got allergies
it sounds like I'm catching a cold
oh the California bill
2098.
so 2098 would
all right we're gonna have to talk about
this this might not go the way you
thought
so California bill of 2098 if I
understand it correctly
um would require that doctors only talk
in the approved way
about the pandemic or was it in general
I think it might have been more
generalized than that but the idea is
that if you're a doctor you couldn't
just
generalized yeah if you're a doctor you
couldn't just be making up stuff that
wasn't
sort of uh approved medical narrative I
don't know the details of that but
you saw how hard it was for me to just
describe it
doesn't doesn't that mean that it would
be hard to decide what the narrative
would be
like how would you decide what is the
approved and what's not so without
knowing anything about it you
automatically could know
it would be pretty hard to decide what
was a violation and what wasn't
now
let me ask you this
suppose it's a toss-up situation and uh
the the experts disagree
in that case is it the worst thing in
the world if your doctor departs the
official narrative because the experts
disagree
well in that case you could say to
yourself no I want you know it's between
me and my doctor you can make that
argument
but what if
the actual risk of Doing It Wrong is
just
really bad
it's a little bit sort of a free speech
problem isn't it
let me back up here all right how many
of you believe in unrestricted free
speech
everybody are we we're all on that side
right we all want unrestricted free
speech but most of you would agree
that yelling fire in a crowd in theater
because it could have an immediate you
know bad impact on people's health and
safety that you would agree that that
should be
um potentially a legal problem right
would you agree with me that
unrestricted except with that exception
you don't want to yell fire in the
crowded theater okay but otherwise
completely unrestricted now while you'd
have to make an exception for
uh libel
at defaming somebody intentionally so
would you agree that we could also have
laws
that say you can't you know libel
somebody
right yeah if it can be proven
all right most of you agree so
unrestricted free speech you can say
anything you want as long as it doesn't
immediately hurt somebody right
right but if you did it with the
knowledge that it would hurt somebody
and maybe even that was why you did it
maybe that's that
somebody says yelling fire in a movie
theater is not illegal no it's not it's
not illegal if it doesn't cause any
problems
you can yell it if everybody ignores you
that's still legal yes that's that's
correct
all right
then uh
so we've got these minor little things
now
um so you're in favor of unrestricted
phrase speech so most of you are in
favor of teaching children
about sexuality at ages five and six
right you're all good with that
oh no no you're not good with that so
that would be an exception too
so unrestricted free speech we're all in
favor of it
unless
it hurts somebody like yelling fire in
the theater or defames them or Slanders
them
or teaches sex to your children
but otherwise
otherwise unrestricted are we on the
same page
otherwise
so in other words all of the exceptions
one of all the exceptions have in common
the exceptions have in common is it that
it is immediate harm
that there is obvious immediate harm to
the yeah there's a safety issue and it's
immediate that's different from saying
General things like oh generally
Democrats are bad and then you make the
argument oh if you hadn't said Democrats
are bad society would be working better
and people would be more alive
so that doesn't work it needs to be
direct
obvious you can draw a clean line from
the language to somebody got hurt in
some of those cases those would be
illegal
and that's what that
2098 law is trying to do
it's trying to prevent people from
yelling fire in a crowded theater
that's what I was trying to do
it's trying to keep you from teaching
sex to children
I mean in a
uh not not literally but what it's doing
is trying to prevent harm
so
the problem is it's probably too broad
yeah that's probably the problem
but could you imagine a situation
in which telling people the opposite of
the known scientifically demonstrated
truth
maybe should be illegal
isn't it is there any certainty
that would allow you to be okay with
that
suppose you had a teacher that was not a
teacher suppose you had a doctor that
was advising people to start smoking
anybody
if you had a teacher advised people to
start smoking should there be any legal
consequence for that
what do you think
should there be legal consequence for a
doctor who tells people to start smoking
most say no most say no because you
already understand that smoking is
dangerous so it's a trick question but
imagine if you didn't know
imagine if science knew it was bad for
you like totally bad for you you didn't
know the difference
but your doctor said that's fine
it's fine it's good for you
would it be illegal then see the only
reason it's not illegal is that you're
well informed so you already know it's
bad for you so that it wouldn't fool you
know
all I'm going to add to this
conversation is that
we do have a precedent
that restricting free speech to stop
immediate harm
is good
but then you have the situation where
the see here's here's where everything
got murky
in my opinion this is where things
currently stand
that then I'm going to be describing
mainstream Sciences opinion not my own
okay
everybody okay with that I'm going to
describe mainstream science's opinion
not mine so don't get on me if you don't
agree with this
mainstream science says the vaccinations
did not stop Transmissions
but it did save a lot of lives that's
what they say not me don't blame me
don't get on me that's what science says
Main Street science
but
is it not also true that the same people
who are telling us what's good for us
clearly misled us I'm not going to say
lie because I don't know who was lying
and who just didn't know
they clearly misled us about the
transmissibility if you're vaccinated
so in that case
should it be illegal
for somebody to depart from The
Narrative when you know that the people
who created The Narrative are not
credible
that's where it gets complicated
because you really don't know who is who
has your best interest
if I knew the the consensus of
scientists had my best interest in mind
I would at least be open to the
possibility
that you know they should have
uh
uh you know maybe some extra rights or
something
but we don't have that assurance
at this point we don't trust anybody
so I think you have to default to free
speech
if you don't trust anybody
because free speech is your only your
only hope it's your only hope
everything else can't work
and maybe Free Speech won't work either
but it's your only hope
so having walked you through it I think
I'm going to favor free speech in that
case even though there might be
situations where there is a media harm
at risk I still go with the free speech
I think
uh the missing snow crab story yeah
a lot of snow crabs missing but I don't
I don't care I don't miss any of them
yes Sweden is going to build new nuclear
reactors
so take that Greta she's in favor of
nuclear Greta likes nuclear now
thanks Greta
uh how about the Alex Jones situation we
talked about that already
that's
the I think the penalty was out of whack
with the crimes
all right
um George is starting up a new reactor
they are
all right all right that's all for now
and I will uh
I will uh talk to you tomorrow bye for
now
