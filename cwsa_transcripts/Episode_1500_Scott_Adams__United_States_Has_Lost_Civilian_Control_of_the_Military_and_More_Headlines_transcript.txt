good morning everybody
well what a wonderful wonderful day it
is except for all the other people
have you noticed that life would be
great
except for the people oh it's people
it's people who are the problem not all
of them some of you are awesome in fact
every single one of you are awesome
but other people people who are not
watching this live stream
oh yeah
they're a problem
you're probably saying scott why is your
microphone not on for you
i don't know no real reason
but that might be better now if you'd
like to take this up a notch and i think
you do all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea's diet a cup
what is it a canteen jug or flask
you think i'd memorize this by now nope
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
me the other day the thing that makes
everything better
it's a simultaneous step it happens to
them
go so good
well
i'm going to start with the shittiest
news
so that everything else doesn't seem so
bad are you with me
you probably all heard that uh norm
mcdonald passed away yesterday age 61. i
have several thoughts on this
number one
i don't like it when people are younger
than me
uh
when people younger than me die
uh well it looks like we have people
complaining about the microphone
over there on oh it isn't working
interesting
how about that
can you hear me now
all right so i just unplugged the
microphone so i think we would be on
the ipad's microphone over on
youtube all right there's nothing i can
do about it sorry
so uh my
my road caster uh apparently just died
that's my mixer
so my mixer is just sitting there with
all the settings just sitting there like
nothing's happening
i'll tell you
i'll tell you anyway back to norm
mcdonald
so
i had a strange interaction with norm
macdonald and i think a lot of people
uh
now the microphone is unplugged because
the
the mixer died
let's go show you
all right i'm just about going to lose
it
i'm really close
to taking this mixer
smashing it to pieces on my floor right
now
i like this close
i don't know if i can resist it
oh
cause i'm just trying to pick it up and
show it to you
and you know it's all curl up well it's
like not working you see the levels not
even moving or anything
so
i'm trying to resist
oh
oh i've got a sledgehammer in my garage
and i want to take you down to the
garage and destroy this thing in front
of you really badly
really badly
oh god do i want to break this like
oh
there's only one person in the world who
knows exactly how i feel right now
you know who you are
you know who you are
i'm going to shake that off i'm going to
shake it off
i don't know what it is with with audio
and me but anyway back to my topic
uh norm mcdonald passed away and uh
a lot of people will tell you their
little story about meeting norm and i've
got mine
so one day norm mcdonald contacted me
and i ended up talking to him on the
phone
and it was this was
maybe
three or four years ago
and
he called me just asked me for some life
advice
which is the weirdest thing in the world
because i'm a gigantic fan i had no
contact with him whatsoever
but he had some some issues
and
he i guess he was familiar with my work
and thought i might have some some
suggestions
so we chatted a while i don't know if i
said anything that was useful
but i've got this other weird connection
to him
two other weird connections it's just
weird how many connections i have to
like the headlines
one is that uh if you're familiar with
the akira the dawn and the music he
makes by taking podcasters voices and
manipulating them and adding music to
them
and so he did that with some of mine and
one of them
that did well
was where i read a norm mcdonald quote
about uh
you know good versus good yes
and it really really worked out well
as a lyric for a song it's just a norm
mcdonald tweet i just happened to read
it and it got turned into music
so that's out there
but the weirdest part about this is that
in the past month i had chosen two
people as my role models
one for my hobby of learning to drum
i'm trying to become a drummer
and the other for comedy
and and i think i mentioned both of them
in public one of them was charlie watt
and the other was norm mcdonald
and they both died this week
i don't know how i feel about that i
mean it's not funny it's not funny but
the two people i chose as my role models
for my my two you know fields of
of interest they both died this week
now
on a personal note
when celebrities die
i generally you know it's not like i'm
going to cry about it they're people i
don't know
but i've cried twice
when celebrities died
once was john levin
and
so um
sorry
all right moving on
so uh cnn
continues
continues to
ah
sorry i had a bad week
anyway um see you then
um cnn continues to brainwash you
with uh anecdotal stories of people
having bad experiences with code
i like to read you know that they have
one per day
so today's is uh let's say
um the anecdotal persuasion is a woman
who got that
got vaccinated in mississippi and she
got covered and died because she was
giving no compromise
sorry
so
all right i'll be fine
um
so apparently one in 500 americans have
died of covet does that sound does that
sound like a lot
one in 500
why are no thumbnails working i don't
know
so one in 500 people died of covet in
the united states i guess
and
that doesn't sound like a lot but here's
the question how many seniors and obese
people died
how many seniors and obese
people died
it's not one in 500 right is it 150
maybe 150
because if one in 50 of that crowd died
and you were in that crowd that'd be
pretty scary 1-500 not too scary
1 in 50.
you have my attention at 150 i'm going
to pay attention
and i'm wondering what where would that
rank on uh
in terms of uh causes of death
if it's one in 500 for people in general
where would that be
like how many people die in cars it's
more than one in 500 right
how many people die riding i don't know
how many people die swimming
probably less than one or 500 so i don't
know where that stack stacks up
there was a tweet by uh laughing jesus
that's his name don't blame me so
laughing jesus tweets
he says i stopped reading dilbert
because of scott's support for support
of the trump
of the trump
uh i may revisit that decision dilbert
is pretty effing funny at times
and so i thought i would like to
encourage more of my critics to uh to
take this approach so if you're a critic
of mine and you have a problem with me
for whatever problem i think you should
punish yourself
because that'll
that'll show me
so if there's anything else you would
like to deny yourself that you enjoy
i think that would be a pretty good
protest
it worked for gandhi
all right gandhi enjoyed eating
but he decided to not eat
as part of his protest there's a good
history for this and i think that my
critics should
uh learn from ghandi i mean
really
can you think of anybody who would be a
more morally inspiring figure than godly
i don't think so
and gandhi did a hunger strikes to try
to get freedom from great britain
and i think that my critics should
take a take a note
if you're mad about anything that i've
ever said
consider a hunger strike
and if the hunger strike doesn't feel
enough
have you ever tried hitting yourself
with a blunt object
um
i mean i haven't but then again i don't
really need to punish myself but if
you'd like to punish yourself as part of
a principled
morally and ethically
proper demonstration i recommend
something painful
for all of my critics
because that'll really show me
sure you should either try to run 25
miles without training
don't eat for a week
don't sleep
sleeping would just make me happy
because you know what makes me happy i
love it when you get enough sleep so
don't do that if you want to protest me
so in fact i would like you to be really
healthy i would like all of you to eat
right
get sleep
and don't drink too much
but if you want to protest me
lots of things you can do to yourself to
really really make it hurt
drink too much
overeat
don't sleep
and if you do those things i promise you
i'm going to feel it it's gonna
it's gonna be bad for me if you hurt
yourself
so
i sure hope you don't do that
well uh
the more i think about it the more i
think that leaving the taliban to china
is a stroke of genius
uh reportedly a major brawl broke out
last week inside kabul's presidential
palace
and at least one leader of the
government is missing
possibly dead
and
the taliban taking over is a little bit
like you know what happens if the dog
chasing your car actually catches it
like what is he going to do when he
catches it
so
i don't feel like the taliban
won
i feel like the taliban
has some issues
maybe some internal fighting
maybe the taliban are not all on the
same side maybe the only thing that
unified the taliban was fighting against
the existing government
i've got a feeling
things aren't going to go so well for
the taliban
and i mean it's tragedy for the afghan
people of course but the taliban
themselves i don't think that's going to
be a good day for them
and i don't think
they're going to love it when china gets
their hooks in them
because china
doesn't really want to just work with
the taliban do they
does china want to have a little
commerce with the taliban
nope
no china wants to own the taliban
tell them that china wants to
dominate the taliban
i'm sure that'll go over well
don't see any problems ahead for them
seems like that should work out pretty
pretty well
so good luck china
i hope you enjoy your taliban
um let's talk about the california
recall newsome one it looks like easily
larry elder has conceded
um it looked like it was close there for
a while didn't it
do you remember the polls that said it
was close
well we were quickly informed that those
polls were not accurate
let me tell you the polls that were
accurate the ones that showed that news
was going to win by a mile and then he
did
but you know
uh but you know
uh
that
well
so why did uh why did gavin newsom win
uh is it because the vote was uh
r-i-g-g-e-d which i'm not claiming i'm
just asking
is it because
it was always going to be that way and
the polls were wrong
why is it we can't have a time
when the polls are right
and the vote is right
can we have that
here's a case where we
think the election was maybe right
but the polls were wrong
but then they were right how's your uh
credibility
i don't know if you could have a lower
credibility for an election than
everything that happened in california
maybe 2020 was lower credibility
but i have no reason to believe there's
any massive
fraud
do you has anybody seen anything that
would indicate massive fraud
now here's the good news
if gavin newsom were to win
oh my god richard thank you
you didn't need to do that
um
here's the good news if gavin newsom
were to win and apparently he has
the only way i wanted him to win was big
because if it were close
yuck if it's close it's all going to be
about the election itself and you know
the integrity of the election and wizard
fraud and
where's my mail-in ballot and all that
stuff
but luckily
and i say luckily because it's a weird
kind of luck if you can call that it was
so not close that maybe it wouldn't
matter even if there was some fraud now
we have not detected any that has been
confirmed
but
we're probably better off
probably better off that it was a big
win at least at least is one less thing
to worry about
now the question about why why did he
win
well
um i think joel pollock had some of the
most insightful comments about this
um part of it might be that
[Music]
kids went to school
you know if you're a parent in
california
the thing you cared about most was kids
going back to school
and then everything else you know was a
bother or something you complained about
school was a big deal and he got that
done
right
so you know other states got it done too
but at least it was one thing
imagine imagine this recall with kids
not in school
can you imagine i don't think the vote
would have gone the same way
i think if newsome hadn't gotten kids in
school it could have gone the other way
but the other thing is that uh
newsome did a good job of painting
larry elder as just black trump
if you're if your opponent can turn you
into black trump
he did a good job and looks like he did
a good job there on the persuasion
so but i think the bigger story is there
are twice as many democrats
that's it
there are twice as many democrats that's
the end of the story you know you can
look for the little things that tweak
this or that but you know there's twice
as many democrats so that's pretty much
the whole thing
so there's this right-wing conspiracy
or is it
that
uh there's somebody in charge of turning
off uh biden's microphone in certain
situations
and i guess senator rish if i'm
pronouncing it correctly was asking
about this
and tony blinken was just laughing at
him saying
no there's nobody in charge that and
apparently it doesn't pass the fact
check that there's anybody who even
could be in charge of it because the
examples of it are just normal the
normal way things work there's no actual
example of this happening
but let me ask you this
um the first time you heard this
that the the idea that there's somebody
who has control of turning off biden's
microphone
and rich was asking who's that person
because that would indicate who's really
in charge who is the person in charge of
biden's microphone
the first time you heard that what was
your impression
because i'll tell you what it should
have been
it should have been
a little bit too much on the nose
right
a little too perfect
that the person who is really in charge
of the country
is literally the same person
in charge of the microphone
that is way too on the news
right
it'd be one thing to say oh i think
there are powers in the wings you know
it's susan rice it's obama whatever
that's actually kind of reasonable
because we do know that ex-presidents
could be influential and you know the
deep state there's enough to suggest
that people could have power without
being in power that's not crazy
but that the same people
or one person
can control the microphone
no
i mean anything's possible but a little
too much on the nose so look for that
too much on the nose thing it's so
predictive
all right uh
tonight
tonight
um i will be a guest on gutfeld
exclamation mark
got filled exclamation mark on fox news
check your local
times we're talking about the the
evening one i guess it's different time
zones different places you can all find
it anyway i'll be doing that remotely
uh tonight
and that is the answer to the question
on locals that they asked me before i
came here on youtube
and the answer is uh no i will not be
stoned today
because i'll be on live tv later
have i ever been stoned
on live tv
okay yes
but you didn't know it
all right um
i think i solved uh covent
in case anybody wants to know
so there's an article i just tweeted
around which questions how we've handled
covid uh and it questions whether social
distance
is the thing we should have concentrated
on versus the time that we spend
together and the argument is this
if
if your virus is spread on spindle like
water droplets then distance makes a big
difference because those droplets will
come out and hit the ground so if you're
far enough away those droplets don't get
there
but if you have an aerosol
virus like coronavirus where it just
sort of floats in the air for a while
it's not like the droplets are hitting
the ground right away
the idea is that the time you spent in
the room
could be the thing that matters
not so much the distance
because you could be right next to
somebody and they're you know your plume
is going up through your mask and their
plume is going up but sort of diluting
and filling the room
so wherever you are if it's in the
aerosol it's just hanging in the air
so what matters is the time you spend in
the room
and the ventilation uh not the so much
the distance does that make sense it's a
reasonable hypothesis right that we
managed the
managed it wrong because we didn't
understand the importance of the
uh of the
hanging in the airport
but here's my question which i add to
this which i believe will now completely
solve the pandemic are you ready why are
you ready
solution to the pandemic
right now
drum roll please
fans
turn on your fans
here's my reasoning
and i would like to
um get a fact checked on this i asked on
twitter if anybody studied this and i
didn't see a response before i got on
but
the hypothesis goes like this and by the
way
this is just ignorant specula
speculation
this next thing is just for fun
i'm not a doctor not a virologist
not a
fluid movement expert
but i'm going to give you some
common sense
and let's let's just
think it through
it goes like this
the the odds of you getting coveted i
believe
are determined by the viral load
so it's not just that you were exposed
to it so fact check be on every part of
this right fact check me on my
assumptions and then my conclusion so
assumption
the amount
that you're exposed to makes a big
difference
second assumption and this has no
scientific basis that i'm aware of
i feel as if a small amount small enough
might give you some protection from the
coven without giving you covert
now that's purely speculation
and it's based on the fact that your
your body might say hey
i feel like there's something out there
that didn't quite infect me i i detected
it but maybe i should just get ready for
it
now i don't know if your body can do
that pure speculation not based on any
knowledge or research or anything else
but
if we know the only thing we need to
know for this following thought
is that the amount of load matters now
it matters two ways
one it matters whether you get it at all
right and the other way it matters is
how badly you're sick
so two ways it could matter a lot now
the how badly you're sick part we know
that's real
right so i don't have to speculate
that the amount of initial load you get
could determine how sick you get
so let's say that's the only thing we
know for sure
is how sick you'll get
but we're not for sure whether a little
bit of exposure might actually help you
in some weird way so that part forget
about that for now
just
just that reducing the load could be
good now turn on the fans
here's my question
did the aerosoled virus
tend to move in clouds
so this is the big question to fact
check anybody who's got you know fluid
expertise do me a fact check on this
so let's say you're in a room
and you've got just normal ventilation
the windows are not open all right so
windows closed
normal ventilation through the ac not
enough to stop anything apparently but
now let's say you turn on fans
if you have fans on and there's and
there's movement
do you get the same viral load
or
does the fan distribute it faster
such that there's a more virus
let's say below uh your waist
and more virus may be above your head
and not as much in a cloud that's sort
of surrounding the people who are
putting it off
what do you think now how hard would it
be to test it
i think you could test it
somehow
so here's my
here's my uh question
turn on the fans in every room make sure
you've got airflow or open a window if
you've got that option and see if the
people who had put on fans and open
windows everywhere they went
or even carry like a little portable fan
you know those little portable fans you
carry
would you be better off having a
portable fan
that you just held here and blew
people's
you know
particles away
than having a mask
maybe right if you had just a little fan
that you walked around with when you
talk to people just just distribute the
air
um
and here's a question on locals a
perfectly good question what about a
now i'm no doctor
but uh i feel that that's a perfectly
good question because
um as far as i know
there's not a single case of anybody
getting covered while giving a blow job
so if you're worried about the covet
ladies
and gay men
if you're worried about getting the
covet nobody has ever contracted covet
while giving a
i don't know that to be true but i'd
like it to be true
so
just think about that
there's an interesting story in the new
york post by melanie natkin about why
progressive women want to date men who
act like conservatives
so apparently even progressive women
like men who act like men
and do things like cold doors and pay
for dinner and
walk on the curb side of the sidewalk to
protect them from puddles and god knows
what from the street
and
also to make the plans to make the plans
and
what do you think about that
how many of the women the few women who
are
brave enough to watch this
by the way if you're a woman and you're
watching
this
you're special because uh i don't think
most women can can hang with this
for some reason i mean my audience is 90
percent plus men
all right now
let me ask you this
men
i've heard that what women like more
than i and i've heard this so many times
right tell me men if you've heard this
also
they're women no matter whether they're
left leaning or right living leaning
that all women
like it when men take the initiative to
make a plan say oh we're going here and
you know
put on your nice clothes and
we'll be going there
women can you confirm
that you like it when men make the plans
and does it and do you like it because
it it makes it seems like the man is uh
being alpha
or being assertive or being sort of a
man is that what it feels like
all right well you're all wrong
although your opinions can't be wrong of
course so your opinion is right but let
me tell you what you're missing
let me tell you as a man
how i feel
if i'm part of a couple
and the expectation is that i'm supposed
to make the plans
how does that make me feel
ladies how does that make me feel
women anybody
tell me how it makes me feel as the man
when i'm the one who has to make the
plans
does it make me feel like an alpha male
strong in control
nope it makes me feel like your
secretary
so let me say this again because your
husbands can't tell you this
husbands just shut up for a minute
guys
guys don't say a thing
i got this
all right i got this for you
disagree with me privately
when you're talking to your spouse in a
minute and you're gonna
don't say you agree with me you don't
need to i got this for you
okay
don't get into this you will get
divorced if you get into this
just agree with your wife
let me do the hard lifting here okay
if you expect your man to make all the
plans you're treating him like your
secretary
and
it doesn't work here's how it
goes
hey wife i just made some plans for us
at eight o'clock
oh
ah
i wish i told you i had plans to go out
with my girlfriends tonight okay well
okay i tried
but at least you know i made some plans
tomorrow
put on your good dress we got dinner
reservations seven o'clock
not tonight
tonight i've got a little bit of a
headache i wish you'd asked me earlier
all right well okay
we'll we'll take this we'll take a run
at it again how about the weekend
weekend comes i got some plans
we're gonna take a trip
oh there
yeah i uh i just went there i went there
with my ex
that's like sort of the last place i
want to go okay well
we'll try it again tomorrow i'm going to
make you a new plan watch me be all
alpha
i'm a man
i'm a man and i'm gonna take charge
take charge of this situation
all right
so i got new plans we're gonna go uh
gonna go watch the uh
monster trucks
monster truck rally
so that'll be a six o'clock on set what
oh you don't like the monster truck
rallies
no you don't like those okay well i
already bought tickets but i'll throw
them away
we'll try it again tomorrow
so
men
just don't say anything
ladies
i know what you're thinking that you
like your man to be take charge and make
plans
shows he loves you
you're treating him like a secretary and
you're making it impossible for him to
even do anything
don't ask him to do something that isn't
a thing he can't make plans for you
do you know what does work
let me tell you what works
wife
hey husband i made plans tonight six
o'clock
for dinner
husband says
oh that's great i told bob we were going
to get together i'll call and cancel
and then you go out to dinner
it's different
it's pretty different
right um
how about uh walking on the curb side of
the sidewalk how many of you men
walk on the curb side of the sidewalk
because it protects your
your woman from whatever
danger there is in the sidewalk okay now
when you walk on the curbside
and let's say you cross the you cross
the road and then you know let's say
you're at an intersection or something
how often does the woman who you would
like to not be on the curbside
how often does she take the curbside
just because that's the way it works
when you turn the corner
and then you have to move her away from
the curbside
so how many times does she do that if
you're taking a walk
all the time right
you're trying to walk on the curbside
and she keeps walking on the curbside
and you got to move her back
it just doesn't work
so
anyway uh anyways great article by uh uh
melanie not kim i enjoyed it
um i think chivalry is maybe uh not
exactly what you think it is
i think that what women think is an
alpha man is a man being your secretary
and having no chance of succeeding
right
if one in 10 times the guy makes a plan
and it works out he's a hero i suppose
that's good but it's a dumb idea
and it doesn't work and you should get
over it
all right um
let's talk about the tds general this is
the biggest news
so general milly according to a new book
by woodward and somebody else costa i
guess
um he was so afraid that trump might
spark a war with china
that he called china
to reassure them and make some plans
on his own
now
trump says he doubts this really
happened
and trump has pretty good instincts and
trump also knows how many stories were
totally made up about things that
happened you know during his his
administration so
given that so many things are just made
up
we don't know now i don't think we've
heard a confirmation or denial from
milly himself so we'll wait on that to
find out if this is true but
let's imagine it's true for a moment
isn't it treason
and isn't this taking civilian control
away from the government and giving us
military control
because the reason that millie gave is
that he wasn't sure that trump was
mentally capable
mentally capable
in his judgment
his personal judgment did i say his
professional medical judgment
no no he's a military guy did i say that
millie uh consulted with a
band of psychologists and psychiatrists
and they told them hey trump is
dangerous you better do something nope
nope it was general milly himself who
just decided that trump was mentally
unfit and that he better make his own
foreign policy with china
military policy
that's treason
isn't it
if if you're making military plans with
not an ally
not an ally
was millie warning china of an attack
yeah
now suppose the worst case scenario
happened and we had actually attacked
china there's no chance of that china by
the way china if anybody's listening
there was never any chance we were going
to attack china
we don't want to attack china
can you think of anything dumber than
attacking china
do you know i don't even think that
millie the general would have had to be
the one to stop it
i think every soldier would have just
stopped
can you imagine being in the military
and the order comes down to attack china
what do you do
do you run and grab your gun
you know and go attack china or do you
say to yourself hold on
let's say you're just a soldier right
you're just a marine and you hear that
the the order has come down from the
united states to attack china and you
haven't even heard a reason there's not
even a reason
what do you do
well i don't think you attack china
i think you literally say um
slow your roll
are you telling us china's not attacking
us
there's no immediate danger from china
and you want us to attack china
i just don't think
i just don't think anybody would do it
i mean you'd have to have at least a
reason
so i don't think billy had any
you know there was no real risk so
how bad is this guy's judgment
his judgment
is awful and this is the same guy who
was
you know
the key player in afghanistan withdrawal
this is the guy who
you know said it was a mistake to walk
with trump with the you know with the
bible or whatever to the church
this guy has terrible judgment as far as
we can tell
and on top of that he looks stupid
do you know he reminds me of
years ago i was a supervisor
of a group of people in the bank
and one of my employees i asked him to
put some data in a spreadsheet
and i walked by and i saw him with his
calculator his hand calculator i said
what are you calculating
you say well i'm adding up the the row
and the
spreadsheet so i can put in the total
and i said to him well you know that's
what the spreadsheet does and let me
show you how because he never used one
so i say you just put this you know
little equal sign here and do this and
he goes oh okay
came back an hour later he still had his
calculator out
calculated
and he said i was just faster it's
faster to do it on the calculator he was
a dumb guy
he was a dumb dumb guy and all i'm
saying is that millie looks like that
guy to me he looks like the same guy
like the guy who couldn't raise himself
out of a paper bag
and
um
he has to be
fired biden has to fire this guy do you
know why
because general milley has said well if
the reports are true i mean first you'd
have to get his confirmation that any of
this happened but if the reports are
true
biden has to fire him because it means
that biden doesn't have control of the
military
this guy gets to decide if biden is
mentally sound
and then to decide whether do what he
wants or make up his own decisions
millie
if the report is true that's a big if
even trump thinks it's not true but if
it's true
he can't be
he can't work for biden
because biden is obviously mentally
challenged obviously everybody can see
it
and if being mentally unfit
means you don't have to listen to his
commands
then we've lost millet we've lost
civilian control of the military
now of course there's a separate
argument which says maybe we should
because it's biden
i don't know if he's capable either but
i'd like to think there would be enough
people
even civilians that we wouldn't really
have to worry about some problem
but
you know because i think the civilians
control biden so there are enough adults
in the room i'm not worried about him
starting a war but if this guy can just
decide
that the president isn't fit just on his
own
we don't have civilian control
it's the most basic thing well one of
the most basic things we need in this
country is civilian control of the
military it's like so fundamental to the
whole system
staying in place
biden has to fire him immediately and
here's the catch
if it's true
biden has to fire millie
for what millie did to trump
and i would have a whole new respect for
biden if he does
because that's nonpartisan
it's also the right move
and he gets a two for her because millie
was part of the afghanistan thing
all right
um
would milly take directions from china
he was talking to china
suppose china said look here's the deal
what we need you to do is x
and then we'll do y
and then between the two of us you doing
x and me doing y
you know we can overcome biden or we can
overcome trump
to some extent
even indirectly
he would have been kind of in the
position to take orders from china
if you know what i mean sort of you know
indirectly
that's not good
um
and tuff said uh trump said uh
uh i've had so many calls today saying
that's treason number one i'll bet
that's true and trump continued
acknowledging that he was tough on china
regarding trade and covent and he went
on to describe the idea that he would
unilaterally attack china as
totally ridiculous
that is totally ridiculous
was there anything
even the slightest whiff
that trump would attack china
or to put it another way
is there anybody in the united states
man woman
child or
unidentified
who would have said let's attack china
can you find me one person in the whole
united states in politics privately
you know in the alley behind your house
anywhere is there any person who thinks
we should attack china unprovoked
remember
it's unprovoked
are you serious
and yet
millie
was dumb enough
to think that trump would be the one
person in the whole world
the one person who would attack china
unprovoked at least militarily
unprovoked
now
if trump had sent a team in to kill the
fentanyl dealers
and maybe that sparked a war i would say
that was worth it because the fentanyl
is a military action so we can we can
certainly respond to a military action
with military action so if trump had
militarily you know gone into their
country and killed their dealers their
fentanyl dealers i of course would
support that completely
even though that's a military action but
it's a military reaction to a military
action
um
sounds like he was being brainwashed by
the media that's exactly what it sounds
like it sounds like general milly was
brainwashed by the media and believed
believed cnn
i mean in a way cnn probably turned this
guy
a silly milly
all right yeah taiwan's got a real
problem
okay so that's what i got for today or
is it
yes it is yes i do i'd love to hear an
answer on the the idea of using fans
you know i did you ever see that there's
an m night shyamalan movie
with mel gibson somebody will tell me
the name of the movie somebody told me
the name of the movie
but they're
science god that was fast
you are so fast
yeah the movie is signs and the you know
i don't want to give away the movie yeah
i'm going to give away the movie spoiler
alert
spoiler alert if you've not watched an
old movie called signs i'm going to give
away
the plot
spoiler
uh in the end they find that there's
some simple solution to beating the
aliens i'll just keep it that way and i
keep thinking that there's going to be
some simple solution to beating ovid
like i just feel like it
but not really based on any smartness or
research or anything it just feels like
there's something there
uh yeah it could be mouthwash it could
be mouthwash and fans
it could be that
mouthwash and fans in fact i'll bet you
they will find out something like you
know soda
you know if you drank a diet coke every
half hour you probably wouldn't get
covered because diet coke kills
everything
um now i'm not suggesting that yeah it
could be smoking it could be daddy pots
it could be dope
i feel like there's something out there
that is just going to make a difference
yeah vitamin d we know about
all right that's it for now and i will
talk to you all
tomorrow and i'll see what i can do
about
fixing my you know what's weird
so this is weird so today i have this
problem with my mixer
the road caster
last night
i looked at it and i realized i've been
leaving the power on overnight so i
didn't have to change anything in the
morning it would just always be ready to
go and i looked at it and i said i feel
like i should turn the power off
sometimes because i wonder if just being
on all the time could ever cause it to
glitch
i literally thought that for the first
time last night
and i left it on anyway
and it glitched
is that a coincidence i've never had
that thought before the one time i had
that thought that leaving it on might be
a problem be glitched
how many times have i used this thing
100
100 what are the odds all right see you
on gutfeld exclamation mark
tonight
