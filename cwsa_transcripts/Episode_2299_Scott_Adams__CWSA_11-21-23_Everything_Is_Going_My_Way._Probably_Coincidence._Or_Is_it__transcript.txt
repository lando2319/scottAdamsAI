[Music]
do good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams it's the
Thanksgiving week special edition what
makes it special I don't know just feels
like it should be and if you'd like to
take this up to a level that nobody
could even imagine with their greatest
imagination all you need is a cuper
muger glass a tanker chelse din a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and happens now
go oh so
good so
good well I have a theme for
today the theme for today is
everything's going my way
now not necessarily because of anything
I've done it's just just a weird day I I
wake up and it feels like everything's
going my way not as fast as you want but
going my way well here are some stories
in no particular order uh rasmason uh
pulled people about their confidence in
Social Security and of course you know
some people said they're confident and
some people thought they were not in
terms of ing it when they retire but I
want to see if you can guess roughly you
know within let's say two basis
points uh see if you could guess how
many people are very confident that
Social Security will be solid the very
how did you do that well well before I
even finish the
question yes yes it's 23% how did I
don't even know how you did that wow
once again
the smartest audience of any podcast
ever ever and by the way if you're new
if you're new to this live stream and
you're watching the other people knowing
the answer to the question before it was
asked that's something you can learn too
yeah if you stay here you'll know the
answers before the questions are asked
for a whole variety of things not just
this we is showing off when we do this
it's just a it's just a taste it's just
a
taste
well give me a fact check here um when I
told you the news that Snoop Dog
announced he was going
smokeless did I tell you I didn't
believe that can you confirm that
because it turns out has nothing to do
with cannabis and everything to do with
the fact that he's promoting a outdoor
solo stove that doesn't make
smoke it's a pretty good move I'm going
to have to say nobody nobody impresses
me more on the upside more often than
Snoop
Dog how does he do everything wrong and
continually get good
results you you you could write a book
about what not to do well don't do any
of these things and then you look in the
book it's like basically a blueprint for
being Snoop
Dog I think that's just Charisma isn't
it complete Charis
because you know somebody said Black
Culture but it's not anything about
Black Culture he's probably as popular
with you know white people as everybody
else he he's just a
singularly
charismatic creature he's just sort of a
oneoff I know I like
Snoop
um so that's going my
way not only do all of my viewers know
exactly the name the the outcomes of
polls before they're asked but uh I
guess correctly on Snoop Dog that that
wasn't true well we have a new
documentary I don't know if you've heard
of it called the fall of
Minneapolis and it basically debunks the
whole George Floyd hoax you know the one
that says Derek Chauvin uh killed
him yeah it turns out that the bulk of
evidence is against that and it looks
like it was a fental overdose exactly
like you thought but the most
interesting part of it is that
apparently it's well documented that all
the police officers were trained to do
exactly what he did exactly the way he
did
it it's actually in the
manual if you talk to chauvin's Mom she
takes out the police manual and she
points to it so with pictures and
everything and during the trial they had
the the trainer you know some the head
guy saying no we don't we don't teach
that but then they talked to the other
police officers they go that's totally
what they teach it's right there in the
manual yeah we all learned that and he
went and he's in jail for
that now I guess the Supreme Court
turned down his appeal which had more to
do with the I think the fact that the
specific appeal was super weak which
doesn't doesn't mean he's you know
guilty it just means that the specific
Avenue he took uh wasn't really there
so is this going my way
because from the
start I you know I said it look sketchy
to me didn't look like murder to me now
here's what's going my way it's it's
definitely not going Derek chauvin's way
but the fact that there was a
crowdsourced documentary to debunk this
thing is a really good sign because it
shows that people are willing to put
their money together to fix something
and they did people put their money
together and some professionals
apparently turned down a good product
Liz Liz Colin is the uh the name behind
that she produced it
and I think it's I think it probably
will be strong enough to move the
narrative but here's what's the part
that's definitely moving my
way watch me say something that I
couldn't say during the BLM George Floyd
years I I'll just say it now directly
but I couldn't say this before so I have
a little bit more freedom now to me it's
obvious that it was a a racially
motivated decision and it's obvious that
shovin did not murder him and it's
obvious that shovin is uh a victim I
mean you could argue that Floyd is his
own kind of victim in his own way but
Shin's the victim here and it's ra
racist it's obvious it's
anti-white and everybody can see
it now now I couldn't say that as
directly before it could I but now I can
say it and I'll bet there won't even be
any push back do you know why there
won't be any push back because there's a
documentary that backs me
up if they push back somebody's going to
send a link to the documentary and then
I'm
done then I'm done so thank you Liz
gullen my my personal thank you for what
looks to be good work for the country
but it helps me as well so that's going
my
way there's a story about a uh a Navy uh
aircraft a
p8a that overshot the runway and landed
in U in the bay in Hawaii so I guess it
was probably some kind of training thing
uh well what it was not in a war zone is
what I'm saying I don't know if it was
for training but it overshot the runway
and landed in the uh kinoa
bay and uh
so is there anything interesting about
that story or I guess that's the whole
story did I miss anything about the
story wait what oh yes um one of my
favorite follows on X is an account
called
amuse and apparently amuse uh pointed
out that it was a diverse
crew and that you know people like to
pointed out when a diverse crew doeses
something that looks like a mistake now
I'm not really in favor of that cuz you
got a whole world that makes mistakes
all the time so if you point out that
the diverse grou made a mistake that
doesn't seem fair to me honestly that's
just anecdotal but it's funny
it doesn't it doesn't make it less funny
can we
agree that sometimes it's just
funny so uh got a little push back on
that only to hear that the Navy is very
proud that uh the crew of this
particular aircraft is diverse and then
there was a there's a photo shown I
don't know for sure it's really the crew
but it alleges to be the crew of that
aircraft and it LO they look to be 100%
female uh including the ground crew
looked like about I don't know 16 people
in the picture all
female and
yeah that that feels a little too on the
nose doesn't it it feels it feels more
like the women posed but there probably
were plenty of men there too I'm
guessing I don't know I don't I don't
buy the whole story but if you just like
to laugh at the
news it was a story about a diverse
group with a lot of women that ran an
airplane off the end of a
Runway i i i hasten to add that doesn't
say anything about female Pilots right
it's just this one story of some
specific individuals as I like to say
people are
infinitely diverse from everybody
else all right um so that's not
important apparently it was a good move
for me to sell my Apple shares a few
months ago well we don't know that yet
it's too early to say that but I sold my
Apple shares CU I thought AI was going
to hurt their business model but that
was before I realized that they're
overtly racist as well so uh Apple uh
Apple is overtly racist against white
men uh as a number of companies are and
their sales declined for the fourth
straight quarter marking the longest
slowdown since
2001
so apparently it's not a good sign to be
racist against white people
and also to be last in AI now I do have
confidence that apple is skilled enough
that they'll catch up on AI but I don't
see anything yet you know if you use
your uh Amazon Digital device whose name
I will not speak
aloud um it's already AI has anybody has
anybody done that have you noticed that
the Amazon digital assistant it went
from sort of like the apple one where it
could answer some simple questions but
you had to ask the right question but
now it kind of just answers any question
just anything you want to ask
it if it can find it on the internet
It'll ask it it'll answer it so Apple is
is inexplicably woefully ridiculously
behind in AI I don't know how that's
going to get fixed but uh being racist
un last an AI is probably not going to
help their stock um so I so that's going
right for me because I sold
mine just lucky I'm not going to claim
that you should do it it's not advice
it's not it's not investment advice I
don't do investment advice and you
should definitely not do what I do if
you do everything I
do you could do
better you could do better than doing
what I
do all right um here's another story in
the in the category of well you should
have just asked
me but the former White House doctor
this was Dr under Trump says that Biden
does not have the cognitive ability to
serve another term it's Ronnie Jackson
yeah Ronnie Jackson
um now he said he said this before but
it's in the news again because I guess
he said it again now I would like to add
this to the list of not only something
you could have just asked me you didn't
really need a doctor for that one but I
feel like they could have asked you do
you think you would have gotten that one
right if if the Press came to you and
said you know we don't have time to ask
any experts but so I'm just going to ask
you do you think Biden is cognitively uh
qualified for the next four
years I think you would get that one
right not only that but you could go
into any crowd and randomly pick
somebody and say hey do you think Biden
is cognitively capable for the next four
years oh I think we'd all get that one
right so I'd like to use this as more
evidence that 80% of everything the
experts do could be duplicated by well
just ask Scott I just see see what Scott
says not 100% but 80% solid 80% just ask
me saves a lot of
time well more good news my God the good
news just keeps coming everything's
going my way so as you know uh Elon Musk
decided to go th Thon nuclear lawsuit
against Media Matters for allegedly
making up a bunch of stats about alleged
Neo-Nazi content by advertisements for
big companies and then those big
companies like apple and IBM pulled
their advertisements from X believing
that that was a good idea now they are
of course embarrassed I would expect if
you if you're Tim Cook wouldn't you be
embarrassed by this situation
yeah to find out that you pulled your
advertisement based on an
overtly despicable organization's
opinion and it was based on literally
some they made
up and they pulled the A and not only
they pull their advertisement but they
they acted to try to the only
remaining source of free speech in the
United
States nothing about that is something
you should be proud about about you
should not be proud of any of that and
worse from the stockholders perspective
some professionals are already saying
that advertising on X is the best deal
for the
dollar so it wasn't good for their
business because the best deal for the
dollar looks like it's on X and it
wasn't based on real
information that doesn't look good they
acted
hastily that doesn't look good nobody
checked in with X to find out if it's
real
and you know they made a big public
display of it that was
embarrassing and they'll probably have
to crawl
back you know what once musk wins his
lawsuit which I kind of expect he will
what are they going to
do they're going to have to admit that
they believed from an
organization you should never believe
anything from if you believe what what
Media Matters told you and then you
acted on it in a business sense you
should have the board
removed like it should be like open AI
it's like um you believed Media Matters
was telling the truth on a purely
political matter and then you change
your business
strategy because of something that Media
Matters told you was
true that would be like taking taking
direction from the
KKK very similar you know disreputable
organization how do you defend that do
they defend that by saying they think
Media Matters is a legitimate
organization I saw Andy
no uh post today that suggests one of
their editors is a antifa supporter just
like you'd
imagine yeah nothing about Media Matters
is
legitimate it's a completely fake
organization dedicated to just slamming
Republicans and and anybody that they
think is not on their side but how did
apple fall for that and IBM do they just
not follow politics and they just don't
know that what everybody knows I mean
most of you knew that Media Matters was
not a legitimate organization am I
right in the comments tell me how many
of you already knew and have known for a
long time that Media Matters is not a
real
organization yeah I mean most of us knew
it but nobody in IBM or apple could
figure this out they didn't know this
was a total you know a job an OP how
embarrassing think of how many billions
of dollars they're managing on behalf of
their shareholders and they couldn't
figure this out this one caught them off
guard that's just embarrassing honestly
that's just
embarrassing um well so it turns out
that uh musk will have some help how
would you like to be medium matters and
wake up and find out
that the richest man in the world and
arguably the most capable human being
that we've ever seen since I don't
know Ben Franklin or something
uh that he's decided to crush you at any
cost at any cost because you know what
you know what Elon M did not say well as
long as it doesn't go over a budget I'm
going to sue them but you know lawyers
are expensive so we're going to have to
stay within the budget and if we start
to go over a budget I'm going to have to
pull
back didn't say
that didn't say that nope and now we see
that uh the attorney general for Texas
Ken Paxton is weighing in he's going to
sue Media Matters too over the same
issue and uh Missouri attorney general
too now what does it remind you of when
the state
individually go after
something what's that remind you
of sort of it's sort of the Soros play
but the opposite direction right so
Soros realized that if he controlled the
states or the local Das it was like a
lot of bang for the buck so you could
use the states to get you things that
you wanted on a federal level which is
in this case get a g of trump it's what
they wanted on a federal level but they
use the state mechanisms to do it so
here uh Media Matters is going to have
to defend not only against the richest
human in the world and most capable and
I might say really
mad it's not even like it doesn't matter
to him I'm pretty sure he's really
 pissed off about this just
guessing just guessing so I would hate
to be on the other end of that and and
do you and do you think the Media
Matters thought they could get away with
it
that did they think that they would just
walk and and they could get away with
this they did because things have gone
the way of the you left leading place so
long that they probably thought they
could just get away with anything like
the sky's the limit well you you just
found the limit remember I told you that
uh Republicans have this weird quality
now I'm not going to call musk a
republican but is not anti-republican
which is a big step in the right
direction um which is they'll Bend and
they'll Bend and they'll Bend until they
stop
bending when they stop
bending some serious is going to
happen because they bent all that you
know there's all that energy stored up
from the bending so it looks to me like
it's going to be a full court press by
Republicans to take out Media Matters
which makes me happy on a level I can
barely even explain and I even like the
fact that it's going to take time cuz
these are going to have to
spend all their time in court defending
themselves probably some individuals
will go broke over it I don't know I
love everything about
this so very much like the uh capitalism
you know the way capitalism works it's
got lots of you know sharp edges and
lots of flaws but if you wait long
enough the free market was correct you
know in the free market sense and that's
what we're seeing in politics and the
control of
information you're seeing a slow but
very distinct correction and certainly
musk uh buying Twitter was the the
number one part of that but everywhere
you're seeing it you're seeing being
people being able to say out loud things
you see a documentary that backs up
things that people couldn't say before
you're you're seeing it pushed in every
direction the attorney generals now
they're they're getting in just
everywhere there's a there's a push on
every door and every direction and none
of that was there a few years ago it's a
very different
environment all right uh there's a
Harvard caps Harris poll that said that
uh there's a difference in support of
Israel by age in the United States so
the people in the 18s to 24y Old
category um
want Biden to pull back his support from
Israel not completely but you know pull
back at least during the uh violent
parts and while 84% of the voters over
65 said that we should support so that's
an enormous difference between the under
24s and the over 65s how do you how do
you
explain how do you explain that huge
difference between The Young and the old
well I call it the Tik Tock
effect now there certainly other there
are other issues where young and old
disagree but usually when young and old
disagree it's because of the
topic right it's like old people would
be less likely to want to um allow
marijuana so you understand that just
because there's an age the age thing it
explains the whole thing right um you
understand what there might be a
difference in you know a whole bunch of
woke related pronoun stuff all that
makes complete
sense uh in the sense that young are
always a little rebellious against
whatever is standard right makes sense
but what would be the explanation for
why The Young and the old would have a
different opinion on Israel because
there's nothing
natural about the Israel situation that
that speaks to young people like Israel
is not a young person topic well it is
now it's got to be Tik Tock it's got to
be Tik Tock and then somebody pushed
back on me in the comments and said oh
but you boomers are being you know uh
being equally influenced by by the
mainstream media to which I say that's
my point yeah that's my point
exactly but everybody's got an assigned
opinion but you know what the difference
is if the mainstream media is let's say
giving you a biased version of things
and maybe you know maybe our
intelligence people are behind it or
whatever some say at least it comes from
America at least it's an American
influence on an American institution but
if China is the one that's influencing
your youth under 24 through Tik Tok
that's a whole different
conversation you know I'm not I'm not uh
delighted with the fact that you know
Americans are getting their opinions
from whatever media Source they follow
that's not ideal but at least you're
you're roughly on the same team you know
even if you're Democrat versus
Republican you're still
pro-american more or less
so I think this is a pretty clear Tik
Tock effect I we hear that Gro the AI
the x is uh rolling out will be on the
tab pretty soon and I'm going to say
again um youan must is under he's
underrated for product design like him
personally his understanding of how a
human thinks and what they care about is
just it seems
unparalleled which is weird because he
says he has Aspergers and none of that
makes sense like if he's got
Aspergers can you just learn from a book
how people work and he did it better
than other people like how do you
understand how how do you you explain
his deep understanding of human beings
and then also Aspergers and it's almost
those are almost two Impossibles but
maybe you know maybe if you're smart
enough you you can you know just force
your way to understand things that
ordinary people can't I don't know so
it's a little bit of a mystery but
here's another example of him getting it
right um wanting to make the XA the the
One-Stop place where you don't have to
leave the app that gets everything right
do you know how much I hate to change
apps so and you do it all day long right
get out of one app get into another app
I hate it and I never have gotten used
to it have you I mean the most common
thing you do all day long is going from
one app to another and every time it
makes me angry
angry I mean I can't even get over it
that that it's so poorly designed that I
have to get out of one ecosystem and
then then go look for it and have to
remember its name and and I've got to
get into a whole different flow you know
you've heard you've heard about losing
flow you know when you're when you're in
the mode to do this task but now you've
got to get in a different head it's like
oh now I have to search for and remember
the name of the app and heard and and
then I probably have to do my password
cuz I haven't been in there and then
it's going to send me a not a thing on
my phone you know but then my phones in
the other room and then I just say
it and I just don't do the thing but if
you put
AI into X where I'm I'm there a few
hours every day anyway that would be
completely
life-changing because I would use it
just because I'm not changing apps and
the fact that you know musk is the only
one who seems to understand that fairly
simple user interface
fact is remarkable like why is he the
only one who figured that out or the
only one who figured it out and could
also execute on it I guess two
things all
right so that's cool that's go in my way
uh news from open AI the most
interesting drama in all of
technology so now uh 700 of the 770 open
aii employees say they'll leave the
company unless the board is changed
out so what's up with these 70 employees
who say they'll
stay I've got a feeling that the 700 who
say they'll leave would be very much the
important 700 like the ones who could
easily get another job and probably get
a
raise but the 70 who are going to stay
are they
HR is it's basically their Dei group
group uh HR and the janitorial staff but
they're on board to stay they're backing
they're back in the board I don't know
if any of that's true I don't know if
any of that's true I'm just making that
up but uh I I have a feeling that the 70
don't really mean it that they just
haven't gotten around to signing it yet
you know maybe they work remotely or
something that's probably the only thing
anyway I saw a post by uh siki Chen I
hope I'm saying his name right how would
you pronounce s
iqi
siki
siki I hope I hope that's close but he
points out that one of the board members
of open AI one of the ones that fired
Sam mman Adam
D'Angelo uh he seems to be let's see I
think he's associated with
qu but he's also launching some kind of
creator monetization for some kind of AI
site called called
po which would allow you to generate
Revenue which is the same thing that Sam
mman was trying to
introduce so in other words one of the
board members was directly competing
with Sam mman and then got Sam Alman
fired now there's no indication that
that's the reason you nobody saying
that's the reason but what was wrong
with this board how how in the world do
you stay on the board when you're
directly competing against them I've
never heard of that have you do you
think the board of Coca-Cola has
somebody from Pepsi on the
board I'm going to say
no I'm going to say no probably not
probably
not and again you know in Hannity
Hannity always says that uh Hunter Biden
was not qualified to be in the board of
barisma because he didn't have industry
experience
do you know who would be a much much
worse choice for
barisma somebody who had industry
experience because they're probably
competing or selling their Consulting to
another company or
something anyway there's a uh
organization called woke alert consumers
research and they're putting out alerts
about what companies are too woke so
that you can avoid woke companies now
when I say woke I mean mostly racist
they're racist against white people so
uh Best Buy Activision
Target Nordstrom and Home Depot are sort
of on their hit list of companies that
they say to
woke to which I say it's going to be
kind of hard to avoid those companies do
you have any companies that are easier
to avoid I'd like
to I'll be down with that but uh I'll do
my best to avoid these companies cuz I
do believe uh that they are um negative
for the
country so I have nothing against the
the companies per se but they're just
not good for the country the way they're
operating
so that makes me happy this is going my
way do you see my theme the theme is
coming together isn't it I'm not even
done it does it just seems like
everything's going my way now it's also
going your way right so I'm not taking
credit for it I'm just saying it feels
like things are going my way and your
way
mostly uh what
else the uh Christopher rufo is posting
this he says the Iowa Board of region
has voted to abolish Dei in all state
universities
hello so Dei is being uh
banned now also in Florida flid right so
now Florida and Iowa any other any other
places where Dei is banned did Texas ban
it you'd expect them to oh Texas as well
okay so now we have uh three obviously
Republican states um Banning
Dei now how many other things are like
that there there aren't that many things
that fall in the category of where one
state specifically is endorsing it you
know and even promoting it where another
state says it's so dangerous we're going
to ban
it well you got drugs right legalization
of
drugs that can be banned in one place
and legalized another you've got
abortion abortion can be banned in one
place but legal in another and now this
Dei so Dei if you're in favor of
Dei you're in the the category of uh
abortion and
drugs so good luck with that good luck
with
that uh but that's going my way at the
same time uh Argentina you know they
elected their uh their new leader who is
a Libertarian uh but right leaning kind
of attitudes
and uh the Argentina stock market you
just
soared I mean seriously soared after he
got
elected so how do that look for
socialism socialism failed and Argentina
just kicked it
out that feels good for
me that feels like something moving in
the right
direction but here's the best
part they did the entire thing with
paper
ballots and and it was done you know
overnight just as it should be or same
day I guess and nobody's complaining
about the
outcome imagine that a radical outcome I
I don't think anybody's saying the vote
was rigged do you know why nobody's
saying that because they counted the
ballots by hand and they had witnesses
to every account just like a lot of
other
places
yeah
um speaking of that in Mojave County
uh that's in
Arizona where is that I think yeah
Arizona um there was a movement to go to
paper ballots but the Attorney General
said you can't do that that would be
illegal because the the state itself
doesn't allow that um but it was voted
down anyway so it was voted down but um
here here's the reason given by the
attorney general for why the hand
ballots should be turned down in
addition to the fact it was probably
illegal because of the state
requirements but the more reasonable
reasons you know the the common sense
reasons they would be turned down is
that hand ballots are less accurate and
take too long to
count that was the actual reason and
nobody laughed when they said
that the hand balance are less accurate
than machines and take too long to
count they this is something that the
Attorney General of Arizona wrote on a
piece of
paper like like that's actually
real now it am I wrong that the
Ridiculousness of this position is
really coming into
clarity now some of you may know if you
joined me yesterday that there was a
very unusually timed glitch in the
YouTube
stream and we're going to see if we can
recreate it because it took account a
minute where I said the most provocative
thing about the election that maybe I've
ever said so I'm going to say it again
it's clearly as possible and we'll see
if there's any kind of weird algorithm
or something that stops IT okay now I'm
going to put it in a sandwich between
two things that will make it um
appropriate and not fake news so the
sandwich will be this I'll start by
saying I'm not aware of any uh reliable
evidence that's the 2020 election was
rigged at any scale that would make a
difference to the
outcome are we all good I'm not
personally aware of anything that's been
proven that would overturn that election
so I think that's now compatible with
with the
mainstream okay but I asked this simple
question why would you ever have
electronic voting
machines because we know that they're
not faster and we know that they
introduce a uh inability to fully
audit and it introduces a new way to
cheat theoretically I'm not claiming
it's ever been done but hypothetically
anything that has a technological nature
adds a a new way to cheat that wasn't
there if you're just observing people
counting
ballots
so I would propose this I don't see any
other reason for electronic voting
machines other than the intention of the
of the entity buying it to
cheat so whoever would make the purchase
order you would imagine that the only
reason they would do it is for the
purpose of cheating because it
introduces more doubt in the outcome and
it doesn't seem to make it faster based
on what we've experienced in the real
world now I'm going to finish my
sandwich by saying I'm not aware of any
reliable evidence that any you know us
election was
rigged I just don't know any reason that
we would have our current set up unless
it was designed to be rigged so our
system looks more like it's designed to
be rigged than designed to be fast and
efficient because you wouldn't do it
this way right when when we see
elections in other countries do we ever
say you know we can get Afghanistan
sorted out if you'll just let us give
you some electronic voting
machines it's it's because people don't
trust them you know by their nature it
adds a black box to the election I can't
see the
code I I don't know what's going on
inside the
machines
so uh I make I make no I'm making no
allegations about any makers of
machines I will I will make the
following
allegation if you were an intelligence
organ organization say a CIA like
Organization for any
country would it be your uh let's say a
goal to see if you could corrupt
electronic voting
machines do you think that would be a
reasonable goal for an Intelligence
Agency of a major
country I I would say that would be an
obvious goal in fact our
CIA probably would want to influence
other elections in some cases because
they have a long history of doing that
wouldn't it be a lot easier if they
could influence electronic machines
because that would be easier to
influence than fake
ballots now I'm not saying anybody's
done it I know of no evidence of such a
thing but how hard would it be so the
question you would ask is if you agree
that there would be several entities you
know other countries that would have an
interest in
influencing an election and maybe even
within the OWN country that would be
interested in influencing it so would
you would we all agree that there's no
question at all that a number of
intelligence agencies would have the
reason you know full
motivation to to sway an election they
could sway would you agree it's sort of
it's their basic duties it's very much
ordinary business for an intelligence
group all right so if they have the
incentive and and I would say it's not
just an ordinary incentive is just it's
not just another thing that would be
nice to do it might be the single most
important thing they could do for their
largest Mission which is you know
keeping the country safe Etc so the
really the only question would be can
they do it would you agree with me so
far that there's no there's no real
question that they have the incentive
and there's no question that it's
directly in their
mission right there's no question about
those things so then the only only
question is could they do it now the
question you'd ask yourself is well if
it's an electronic system and it's a key
very important one presumably it would
have the highest level of protection so
that an ordinary hacker who just tried
to hack in from the
outside probably can't do it that's my
guess my guess is it would be literally
impossible to hack into their Central
operations from the outside they
probably have an air gap
but is that how intelligence agencies do
stuff do they hack in from the
outside
sometimes sometimes what is the more
common way they do it the more common
way is to find anybody who has access to
the code within the company and
blackmail them or Co-op them or bribe
them do you think that intelligence
agencies are good at identifying people
in a company that have access to stuff
that they want to have access to and
then bribing them or blackmailing them
of course they are again it's their
primary
business it it's not something they've
done once in a while it's their primary
business is co-opting people to be on
their side when when that would be
disloyal in an ordinary
sense now given that it would be in my
opinion almost trivially easy for at
least one Intel operation like even if
several countries were trying to do it
you know what are the odds that at least
one would succeed over time well if
you're looking at any one
election well maybe not that high a
chance of somebody would succeed but
what if you just keep playing it Forward
year after year after year and
everybody's trying and trying and trying
presumably don't you get to a point
where it's
guaranteed
I don't see any
scenario where Corruption of electronic
voting machines isn't guaranteed in the
long run and I would say that the only
thing you can't know is whether it's
happened
yet that's the only thing you can't
know but you can know is
guaranteed it's
guaranteed would anybody disagree with
my statement that is guaranteed it's
actually
designed to guarantee that eventually
some entity will have control over the
election um hardware and software that
may not be what the managers of the
company had in mind it's
guaranteed now that doesn't mean that if
it happened somebody wouldn't catch it
and you know reverse it but it's
designed for
this now uh did you notice that you
yoube did not
glitch now it doesn't mean that this
will still be there when you watch it in
playback it doesn't mean
that so we'll see now you see how
carefully I had to uh sandwich that and
again I'll end it again by saying I'm
not aware of any evidence at all that's
credible that any of the elections have
been riged in any substantial way I
don't know of any anything that I
believe at
all it's just
guaranteed all right well knowing that I
believe uh that's going my
way
um meanwhile in Georgia US District
Judge Amy totenberg uh ruled in favor of
handmark ballots because
of why what do you think was a reason so
this is a different case the US District
Judge ruled in favor of handmark ballots
over machines what was her
reason machine flaws violated the
constitutional rights of Voters because
there were cyber security issues with
the
machines so in one
state in one state people are uh
threatened that they'll go to jail for
believing the hand-counted ballots are
more
reliable actually threatened with jail
for even believ it
the hand ballots would be more
reliable in Georgia a judge looked at
all the evidence and said oh hand
ballots far more
reliable than than machines that might
have cyber security
issues and by the way I don't think the
cyber security issues of the
machines are the real
threat I think it's an Insider problem
like if you were to rank the threats
there there it does look like there's a
real risk that some hacker would put a
thumb drive in some machine somewhere
right that looks like a real risk but
that' be kind of hard to get away with I
feel like you need somebody on the
inside or maybe both like you said maybe
both possibly so I would say this is
moving in my direction because we've
gotten to the point where uh you have
battling uh attorney general in one
state versus the district judge in
another State well US District drug
um opposite
opinions about this topic
now let's do a little risk analysis
shall
we I have a a view that Democrats in
particular are bad at risk analysis and
that that that explains a lot of what
looks like a political opinion
difference and it's not really that it's
just if you're good at risk anal
analysis you have one opinion and if
you've never done risk analysis and you
don't know how it works or you have a
half opinion where you're not even
including all the variables well then
you have a different opinion but it's
not political it's just one one looked
at all the variables and knew how to do
it and the other just didn't know how to
do it all right so here's your situation
you have experts who claim that uh
electronic that uh electronic machines
have uh risk
and that also they might be slower in
some
cases and and have less
credibility um paper ballots have the
same claim that they could have problems
but we have definitive examples where it
worked fine would you agree that the
paper ballot method has you multiple
very
definitive good election results in
other places so I would say that the
paper ballot is close
to close to everybody agrees Works
wouldn't you say pretty close to solid
agreement that if if you had people on
both sides watching every ballot being
counted that'd be hard to beat you know
and and I'm sure we could do it fast
enough if you had enough people
involved but do you would you say the
same about electronic
machines well with electronic machines
there's either a catastrophic
problem or no problem at all
catastrophic would mean it would change
the
election with paper ballots you could
easily imagine a whole bunch of
errors but probably like individual
mistakes they're honest mistakes you
know a little bit of weaseling but
probably sort of averages out you know
whereas the electronic machines could
actually completely reverse a vote
hypothetically or at least at least
people imagine it actually it would be
the same the argument would be the same
if the citizens simply imagined it could
happen and even if it couldn't because
your your elections have to have
credibility for the system to work we we
have to know that the right person got
elected so from a risk
perspective it's kind of a
no-brainer am I right to me this is an
absolute risk assessment no rer the
electronic ones I have no specific
reason to doubt them right I have no
evidence that anything went wrong with
any electr it could be that they've
never had a problem ever could be I
don't know if
any uh any that changed an election um
but we also know that that would be the
one way you could really flip an
election if if a bad actor got in there
but the paper
ballots probably couldn't flip the
election even if he
tried so to
me there's literally no risk analysis
question here
whatsoever right the only time it would
make sense to have electronic
voting now watch this point this is
important the only time it would make
sense to have electronic voting machines
is if the public was confident that they
worked even if they didn't but as long
if the public had confidence in
them you know even if there was some
some
trickery we'd still probably go on and
not even know that the wrong president
got elected and you know just go on with
our
lives but yet but the public has to
believe it's credible and we don't have
that for maybe half of the
public actually I think that's the
number I think rasmon said something
like half of the public thinks there
might be some some Monkey
Business
so
um I think that's heading in my
direction
too the the larger issue
of election
Integrity well there's a horrible
story uh somewhere in California Colin
rug was posting this so there's this
male babysitter Matthew blah blah he got
sentences to 700 years in prison for
sexually assaulting 16 boys that he was
the babysitter
for now remember I said my theme was
things going my
way well this is a horrible little story
and nobody wanted this to
happen but I reposted it with this
comment I said when people call me a
bigot I like to ask if they would hire a
male
babysitter it's a real conversation
Ender it is and by the way you've heard
me say this right before this story
you've heard me say
explicitly if if you think that you're
not a bigot would you hire a male
babysitter now do you see the
difference let let me let me explain it
again everything's going to come into
Focus here here's where you should never
discriminate um in
love in
friendship in um hiring
in uh renting
apartments and in politics you could
probably come up with a dozen other
things where the country just doesn't
work if people discriminate in that way
so it's not good for the discriminator
it's not good for the person
discriminated against and it's not good
for the system so literally nobody
benefits so there's there's a whole
bunch of
discrimination that any reasonable
person would say all right that doesn't
work for anybody like that's just a
losing system don't do
it however there is one category of
discrimination that's not only morally
and ethically allowed it's really really
recommended do you know what it
is
self-defense safety when it comes to
your self-defense and your safety nobody
gets a second
guess do you know what your opinion
about how I defend myself matters to me
it
doesn't does my opinion of how you
should make yourself safe should it
matter to you no no I mean unless I was
some expert or something which I'm not
no no anybody's decision about what
keeps them safe such as making sure you
don't get a male
babysitter
absolutely ethically morally logically
defensible
absolutely and if you're in any other
situation in which your safety is
immediately at risk you can discriminate
all you want you know it's not even
illegal right it's not illegal would it
be illegal to prefer a female uh
babysitter well technically right if if
they were going to go thermonuclear and
sue you yeah technically do you think
anybody in the world would take that
case I don't think so no no I I can't
imagine a lawyer arguing uh to you know
for the male babysitter and let's say
some other case uh with the with the
intention that you know if I win this
case there'll be a lot more men
babysitting like you wouldn't even get a
lawyer to take the case it's just so
obvious that you don't you don't give up
safety for a
wokeness everybody clear on that when it
comes to your own personal safety
discriminate all you want
and and I'm not saying you know white
people should discriminate I'm saying
everybody all the
time if your safety is involved
discriminate like crazy I got canceled
for saying that because I said it
inelegantly and and the other example I
use besides the babysitting one let's
say you're a black family and you're
trying to decide what community to move
to you're relocating and one Community
has uh the KK
headquarters but probably most of the
people who live in that town are not
racists so do you move to the town do do
you move to the town or are you going to
be a big old bigot and not go to a town
just because the kka headquarters is
there well I would black I would black I
would back any black family who said
screw this you literally have the KKK
headquarters in your t down I don't care
that some of you are
nice I care that I'm safe my kids are
safe so you go to another
town you get the F out of there now
would that be
discrimination
yes would it be good self-defense and
smart for that family yes so none of
this has to do you know specifically
with what just white people are doing
it's a it's a universal law that you
don't want to go where the odds of you
being
hurt are
higher don't do that go where the odds
of you being safe are better and you
know what if somebody else says but but
hey you're calculating the odds wrong
you know because you're a bigot you've
calculated the odds wrong do you know
what I say to that wasn't your
decision you don't you don't get a vote
when you calculate your odds about how
to keep yourself safe I don't get a vote
so you're welcome to
disagree you're not going to arrest me
for
it so I think even this male babysitter
story is going my way even though it's a
horrible
story uh I saw a article on X that said
that uh Eisenhower said 50 years ago
that it would take I'm sorry Eisenhower
said that it would take 50 years to
re-educate the
Nazis that's exactly my
estimate because I was wondering how
long would it take to uh basically
brainwash another generation you I think
you need two
generations here's why so you generate
you you brainwash the first
generation um but you're not going to
get a a full take but then the that
brainwashed young people they become the
parents and then you keep brainwashing
so now you've got a kid who's hearing
from the parents but also from the
school the same message the first
generation would maybe hear a different
message from their parents from the
school so it's like could be better but
by the second generation you're getting
it from the parents and the school so 50
years is sort of a two generation play
and remember uh uh one of Israel's
leaders a general or something somebody
I forget said that right after the
October 7th attack that they were going
to change reality in Gaza for 50
years they were going to change the
reality for 50
years to me that sounds like they need
two generations of
brainwashing which they do there there
is there's not a second way to handle
this if anybody could come up with the
other way to handle
this I'd love to hear it but I don't
know what it is so yeah 50 years of
brainwashing his
head um there's a multiple reports that
there's going to be a hostage deal today
or at least Israel's meeting to um
approve it or something is there is
there an update since I started is there
an update to confirm or not that the
hostage deal is going to
happen all right I don't see any
confirmation we're still waiting right
all right I'm going to make a
prediction that there will not be a
hostage
deal or that if they make a deal it goes
wrong doesn't work out because here's
the part I don't
understand what exactly is Israel
offering in
return Israel is said as clearly as
possible we're going to kill everybody
in
Hamas right they're going to kill them
all they're they're not going to like ah
we got 20% of you guys I guess that'll
teach you no they said they were going
to kill you all every single one of you
or put them in jail I suppose if they
surrender so so what is Israel offering
in return we will kill you at a slightly
slower
schedule how does that work we'll kill
you but at a slightly slower schedule or
do you think that the Hamas Fighters are
trying to get their own prisoners out
and so what they're really trading is
the other prisoners that Israel already
has why would Israel let them
out I mean
I you know I don't think they would do
it just for trading uh trading
people I don't know I feel like both
sides are playing an op on the other and
that neither of them expect to sign
anything that's what I think it just
doesn't feel
real
yeah it doesn't feel like it could
because I
um if what Hamas is asking for is a
ceasefire why would why would the IDF
think that was a good idea unless they
were sure they could gain nothing from
it if and let me ask this if Hamas said
we need a 4-Hour ceasefire to pull this
together or whatever hours it
is wouldn't Israel say okay but you have
to do it in the daytime
so that the hours of the ceasefire are
daytime hours so they can just watch
what's happening from above because if
you could just watch in the daytime
wouldn't you see them coming in and out
of tunnels and maybe pick up some
patterns you if you saw them trying to
gather up the
hostages you know from the air if you
could figure out where they were going
or where the hostages came out of
wouldn't that suggest that there might
be more hostages there like in other
words
did they only collect up the hostages
they PL to release or were they taking
you know two from this group of hostages
and two from this so there might be a
whole bunch of
intelligence that Israel could pick up
by pretending that they're going along
with this so but I don't think this is a
straight deal there's something about
the deal that one or both sides is not
saying directly but that's the real play
there's something else going on
here so don't
uh what I don't expect is that it will
be as clean as here's 50 people in
return for a 4-Hour pause I don't see
that
happening all
right um here's
my um
hypothesis so have you noticed that some
of the polling is
inexplicable so we've heard lately that
uh uh Trump is winning with black men
which be would be the weirdest
turnaround of all politics but then we
hear that Trump is actually beating
Biden in the 18-39 category I think it
was NBC did that
poll now does any of that sound
true it doesn't sound true to me but
would NBC have any
motivation to give you numbers that
weren't legitimately
done well I don't know but let let us
speculate people who know more about
these things than I do often say that
NBC is the organ that the CIA uses to
put out stories that are to their
benefit people also say that the CIA is
more of a you know a
Democrat uh machine and that the media
the intelligence people and the
Democrats Are All One Big
Blob well I don't know if that's true
but if that's true why would
hypothetically why would the CIA and Or
democrats want to put on a poll that
absolutely nukes Joe
Biden here's my
theory if if Democrats saw that Biden's
overall numbers had gone down in every
category which just a little in every
category it was enough to make Trump uh
pull higher would that send Panic into
Democrats the the simple fact that sort
of in general in just a very general way
Trump pulled ahead
probably not because a year before the
election that's sort of a common thing
the person behind can come back from
that so they wouldn't Panic from that
and it wouldn't be necessarily an
indication that Biden was the problem
you know maybe it's just a Democrats
policy
thing
so why why would there be instead of a
general poll going down why would he hit
these two categories like black men
and young people well I would argue that
the Democrat Party has a is a
three-legged
stool the the strongest parts are
women uh black
voters and the young would you agree
three natural groups women black voters
and young
people well now the poll has shown that
um somebody saying Jews but it's such a
small percentage of the public that's
not that's not a big polling part
um so is it a coincidence that two of
the major legs of the
stool young people and black voters both
suddenly were wildly and a whack with
all past P
polling kind of suddenly and
inexplicably
anaak and even pollsters are
confused which I confirmed this morning
pollsters actually don't quite know
what's going on there like it's not
real now there's some thought that maybe
Bots are involved or you know there's
something about how polling has changed
and that that could be the whole story
but consider this
possibility if your candidate was simply
a little bit underwater compared to the
alternative and he had beaten the
alternative last time but he had and and
the one who was underwater hadn't really
uh campaigned very hard yet you'd still
say well I'll give him a chance right
that that would not be cause for
removing them I've never seen it happen
you wouldn't remove somebody for being
down
2%
but suppose you had a candidate who is
not
only down compared to the competition
but was going to remove two of the three
stools of your entire party and maybe
they would stay that way like if you if
you get people to vote the other way
once it could get sticky you know they
they might not come back so it looks to
me and I'm not saying this is true it
looks to me like an op in which some
shady forces have gamed the polling
system somehow to make it look like
Biden is not just somebody who's 2%
lower than the competition but somebody
who has destroyed the architecture of
their entire
power
um system which is they got to have the
the three legs of the stool and this one
candidate Biden alone is the only
candidate who takes two of the two of
the legs out of the stool that is an
ironclad argument for replacing them
because you're not just losing an
election you're losing the Democrat
Party right so to me it's a little too
on the nose that two out of the three
stools get taken out by recent polls at
exactly the time you know you see
somebody like axle Rod saying hey maybe
he is too old you should consider
dropping out does it seem like a big
coincidence to
you know I'll just put that out there uh
and then there's a report today that uh
Biden's strategy for the black vote is
not to concentrate so much on uh racism
and racial
Equity but rather cost of
living does that sound like a good
strategy I don't know that that's going
to be strategy but that's what's being
reported that
um that he's not going to hit the equity
equality racism thing too hard now that
was his entire approach in the first
election was racism racism finding
people hoax blah blah blah do you think
he's going to abandon that I do do you
know why because it's
embarrassing and if he brings up the
fine people hoax one more
time
he he's probably going to have his shove
down his
throat right I think I think I think
we're at the point where the fine people
hoax doesn't work anymore I think
somebody just shove it down his throat
and so they they moved to cost of living
but listen to how weak this argument
is so imagine being in a meeting where
somebody's advising the Democrats or the
president and this is what they advise
them to get the black vote you ready
this will this will get the black
vote uh they're going to run a series of
ads that talk about the president
lowering the cost of living including
Health premiums prescription drugs and
the cost of
insulin okay those are real
things those are real
things it's just so bad politics if you
wanted to convince somebody that the
cost of living was too high
you go for food and gas and
rent am I right Health premiums
definitely people care about but you
know who is most associated with healthc
care Democrats Democrats are most
associated with healthare so if your
health care costs too much you need to
avoid that conversation not not draw
them to
it right do you do you think that black
people are looking at their Healthcare
premiums and they're saying whoa thank
you
Biden I don't think you even won I bet
there are zero black people who looked
at their health care premiums and said
thank God there's no Trump look at this
good price I'm getting on my
Healthcare now it might be true the
healthc care would be even more
expensive but you can't see that you
can't see would have been more expensive
you can only see that it is expensive
it's exactly the wrong person persuasion
political place to go I mean there's
like it's like they have no instincts
whatsoever so they you know they better
have a backup plan if you know what I
mean so am I right about that now the
thing about gas and uh food is that you
do them more often than you do anything
with health care so you're you're
reminded of those things more often and
uh healthc care premiums are often
deducted from your paycheck or or from
your account so you don't see the costs
every every month for your healthare you
might see them when you buy some meds
but even when you buy
meds have you ever picked up some
prescription meds and said to yourself
wow these are a lot cheaper than they
could have
been never you just say it's
expensive you just look at it and go oh
this is expensive you've never once said
it could have been worse never but when
you buy gas and you buy food
um as I did the other day you I'm one of
these guys that you hate who doesn't do
a lot of shopping on his own but the
other day I went into shop and you've
had the experience so I'm just telling
you what you already know right I've got
this little bunch of
food that's like literally you know the
entire footprint of it would be like a
little bit bigger than a
football and and they're like and that's
$160 and I said
what what are you kidding
me oh my
God so if you want to tell people that
uh you're working on prices you better
do something that they can see at the
point of purchase and they're not doing
anything like that so I so I don't want
to give advice to Democrats but it's a
losing
play
uh that ladies and
gentlemen was all the important things I
had to
mention oh
hello
um and did I miss
anything an orange and Japan is $5
wow um all right looks like I hit all
the big
things I never talk about Rush
limbo should
I uh BL blah BL I'm just looking at your
comments oh throw in my hat as CEO of
open
AI I don't want a real job all right
that's all for now YouTube thanks for
joining and looks like we were glitch
free and I'll talk to you tomorrow
