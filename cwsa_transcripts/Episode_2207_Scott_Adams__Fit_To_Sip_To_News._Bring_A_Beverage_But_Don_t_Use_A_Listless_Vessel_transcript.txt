do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the next highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
today
I had to rewrite the simultaneous sip
so it'll be a little different today and
it's not my fault it's not my fault
events events in the world caught up but
you'll see the change in a minute
um but if you'd like to participate
all you need is a cup of mugger glass
attacker Chelsea style the canteen jug
of flask a vessel of any kind will
accept a listless vessel no listless
vessels
but otherwise a vessel of any kind
except a listless one and fill it with
your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
Pleasures the dopamine here the day the
thing that makes you and everybody you
know better
go
if I added beer to this
no I'm not going to do that
but it would make you look better
just saying coffee goes only halfway
well I got lots of stories today
stories oh my God we got stories
um as you know the tropical storm
Hillary
smashed into California Southern
California yesterday The Babylon B
reports that her hurricane Hillary
destroyed thirty thousand emails yeah so
there's already been 30 000 emails
destroyed by Hillary and uh we hope that
there will be not more damage
now I'm going to reuse a joke that I
used on Breitbart radio with Joel
Pollock last night which you can hear
and replay if you go to my Twitter
account you can see the or Joel
Pollock's Twitter account
you can see the link
but as I said on the radio it uh
is it just a coincidence that there was
an earthquake
at the same time the rainstorm hit
at the same time that
Los Angeles is becoming filthy with
human excrement and all kinds of outdoor
living
now did anybody think that there would
have been a good time to just pour a
little laundry detergent on the street
because you got the shaking
he got the water
California has become self-cleaning
it's self-cleaning yeah
just just put a little bleach on there
and just wait it'll shake and rinse and
then the winds will dry it off it's
really it's a whole system
all right uh here's an update on my book
reframe your brain which is getting
amazing reviews
but still not approved by Amazon for the
soft cover so only the Kindle is there
but we do now have a reason that it was
so far not approved
the reason is something that their
automatic system should have told me
told us the moment we submitted it it
was you know one little box that needs
to be checked differently
but
they knew it
why'd it take five days I don't know
four or five days
so in theory
once we make this change
I doubt it will automatically be
approved
I suspect it'll go back into a well
we'll take several days to look at it
and see if there's anything else we
don't like so I don't know
but in theory it would be available on
tomorrow-ish I'll let you know
um
the threads
app you know threads from meta it's the
uh the X competitor
apparently uh it's down 85 percent in
traffic since its launch
but now they're launching a browser
version browser room so before you could
only access it with the app but now you
have the browser version
so now there are two ways to get to the
thing you don't want
when there was only one way to get the
thing you don't want that's not enough
that's like that's like leaving the job
half done no Zuckerberg finishes the job
by giving you two ways to get to the
thing
you don't want to get to
well there's a thing called micro
schools
apparently there's a whole bunch of them
popping up these are usually tuition
based private schools these are
alternatives to public schools and they
have up to 25 kids so it could be like 5
to 25 kids
and they're popping up all over
now
I love this
if you have ever had a team
can you back me on this statement the
biggest problem that kids have regarding
school is what what's the biggest
problem kids have regarding Public
School
it's the other kids it's the other kids
yeah because humans are terrible
so if you put anybody in any group a big
big group of humans terrible things
happen
now it's kind of hard to make friends
too have you ever talked to a teen about
how hard it is to make friends in school
because if you just walk in
you know if you're not part of a team or
something
you can't just make a friend
is really hard
but imagine you were in a school where
the whole school was 25 people
who probably lived almost within walking
distance
if you had a school of 25 people you
would almost certainly know all 25. you
would almost certainly get invited to at
least half of their birthday parties
right it would really I would think that
that's almost the perfect size for a
school 25 kids
it seems like you you'd always have
somebody that you could hang around with
because you'd know them better than you
knew anybody
so that's good news there's your free
market working the way it was supposed
to
um apparently Trump is not going to
debate
uh maybe at all certainly during the
primaries but maybe he doesn't need to
debate anybody
and I don't think there's anybody that
less needs to debate than Trump
is there anything about Trump's opinion
you don't already know
or anything about the way he operates
that you don't already know
do you suspect that if he gave a uh if
he didn't
a debate do you suspect it would be any
fact checking probably
do you think you'd come out really good
on the fact checking well history
suggests that that might be a problem
um so why would he debate I've heard
people say it would be an insult to his
supporters if he doesn't debate
but you know I'm backing
um there's a vague Rama Swami but
it seems to me that not debating would
be the smartest thing to do
why would his supporters want him to do
something that would degrade his chances
of winning
that that's the least
the least reasonable take on this is
that his supporters will be unhappy if
he does the smartest strategic thing
that everybody can see right you don't
have to be a genius to know that it
creates a reason for him to get in
trouble
because they take something out of
context
but it doesn't give many upside
you know the primary is going to go the
way it goes
so I think he's making the right choice
we'll jabber about it but it doesn't
matter
and more generally I would say
uh here here's something I learned a
long time ago
if you're the if you're the star
you don't share the stage with seven
people who are not the star
never if you can avoid it you'd never
ever do it now when Trump was first
running let's say
2015-16 he wasn't really the star yet I
mean in a sense he was but you know the
other candidates were equal you know at
least equal weight but once you're once
you're the gigantic one you don't hang
around with the Seven Dwarves you know
what I mean
sorry I just stole your comment I saw it
there I I was I was kind of heading
there but you beat me
yeah so every part about this is the
right decision the if there's one thing
that Trump gets right consistently
it's the show
I like to call it that the show
you know it's separate from the politics
and the managing and the governing
there's the show and then the and the
primaries are about the show
he knows the show that wouldn't be the
right show
um so you'll be counter programming that
which is the Smart play
all right I'd like to call out some fake
news uh from Fox News
I think
so this is an opinion not a fact
do you remember the news that
um when Biden was on vacation and he was
riding his bike with the other people
and as he rode his bike somewhat at a
little bit of a distance from the press
and the Press were yelling questions
presumably but one of the questions was
do you have a comment about the Maui
fires because they were happening at the
time
and then uh Biden yelled back no comment
and the News reported that on the
question about Maui when Maui was
burning that he said no comment
is that true
do you think that really happened
you saw it yourself it's right on video
right there's no question
there's Biden
uh there's the question hey what about
Maui Biden says in direct response no
comment
so he said no comment to Maui right
that's that's obvious
he was asked about my amount he said no
comment I don't think so
I'm sorry that's not what I saw
I did not see that
I saw somebody saying no comment in a
general way without regard to what the
question was
because that's what you would do in that
situation
you would not choose one thing to give a
no no comment to as you're riding your
bicycle by you would simply see
reporters you're on vacation
they're going blah blah blah and you say
no comment and you keep riding your bike
in my opinion that's fake news
who agrees with me
let's see how many agree
do you think that was fake news
I'm saying lots of yeses
some knows
yeah see the trouble is that the no is
two on the nose you should have picked
this up right away
right if I haven't taught you the on the
nose trick yet
what have I done
nothing yeah it's a little too on the
nose that the president of the United
States would say no comment about a
natural disaster
that's not really a thing that happens
anywhere in the world ever
so when you see something that doesn't
happen anywhere in the world ever
and the news says it just happened
that's two on the nose
because that would be bad for one team
in a really unusual way
now am I 100 sure no
because I would require mind reading
right I would actually have to know what
was in Biden's Minds when he said it but
you know what else would require mind
reading
to imagine that he meant that the no
comment only about Maui that would be
mind reading
so I'm saying if if it would be mind
reading in either interpretation
and one of the interpretations is absurd
it's absurd that he would have said no
comment about a national disaster that
was in the making that yeah it was
correct it's absurd
so you're you have to you have to accept
something absurd
to accept that that's a true story
now I haven't I haven't even looked it
up to see what the Democrats say but I'm
sure it's that I don't have to look it
up to know that that's what they would
say
so
by the way the reason I the reason I do
this kind of content
is so when I say something that you uh
you know this sounds like I'm a team
player
then you can at least say okay he
doesn't always just back that one side
because I call out the fake news on CNN
and MSNBC just all the time
it's not all in one side it's very much
not all on one side this is basically a
rupar it's a rupar situation you know
slight variant of it
all right um Biden I guess will visit
Maui there are reports that he'll be
bringing his beach chair and sunscreen
and he'll be on the beach uh enjoying
the weather no that's not true he will
be talking to the locals we think
um anyway I saw Jason Chaffetz also on
Fox News
he had an article of the five signs that
Biden is not really running
and
you can see him too right so one of the
signs is his campaign is way
understaffed
for what you would expect for a
presidential campaign for this this time
of the cycle
so he's not even Staffing the way you
would staff he's not going to the he's
not going to Battleground States
the very thing you would absolutely be
doing right now go to Battleground
States
and staff up and then Kamala Harris is
nowhere you know you could probably add
five things to this list yourself
but at what point does it become super
glaringly obvious
that
and there's little uncertainty here
because I'm sure that he's been told
he's not running
and when I say he's been told I mean
he's been told
I mean that literally
I mean it's not his decision I mean that
Jill told him he's not running and he
can't do it without her that's what I
think now again that would be you know
mind reading I'm not a psychic I wasn't
in the room but all signals are pointing
the same direction
that this this vacation thing he's doing
probably has a lot to do with
transitioning them out of the office
that's what I think I think that's
mostly about that
so we'll see
there's a technology now there's a paper
published and a device built an
electrolyzer device that can turn
CO2
into propane
and apparently it's somewhat existing
technology that could be scaled in other
words you don't have to invent anything
else they've already invented it it uses
materials that exist it looks scalable
Maybe
Maybe
if we could if we could make energy out
of CO2 and apparently it would be
economical and and doable
so it's viable
again I say which climate model
which climate model anticipated turning
CO2 into energy
none none
all right
there's uh some thought that video games
if they were optimized a little
differently could replace uh
Adderall so that people have HD well 80d
HD HD so that if there's an Adderall
shortage or they just didn't want to use
a pill that they could use a video game
they have the qualities that would cause
them to focus and maybe learn to focus
so there would be a lasting benefit it's
almost like a drug
so in a sense the experts are saying
that a video game can operate the same
way as a drug
meaning that whatever chemical change
happens within the person you could
chemically change it with the video
experience in a way that might be
similar you know not the same but
similar to how a drug might help
now I would like to add to that to say
that all forms of art are drugs
all art
is a drug
music makes you feel a different way
what does that a pill drugs music can
motivate you make you work out harder
what does that some drugs music can make
you sad and down what does that some
drugs so basically
the best way to think of all art
is that it's a
it's a useful drug but like every drug
every legal drug let's just talk about
legal ones like every legal drug if you
use it for the wrong purpose you would
get a bad result
so if you if you match your music
with the wrong kind of mood to whatever
you're trying to accomplish that would
be like taking the wrong pill
now this is something I've been saying
forever
but I don't think I've ever gotten
through
I think people say yeah yeah some people
like music I hear what you're saying no
no it's it's the same power as drugs
and if you treat it as a drug you can
use it in its most useful form to cheer
you up to make you happy make you think
differently maybe concentrate better in
this case
so it's just a good reframe to think of
all art as a medicinal thing or
something that could maybe be a
performance enhancer but if you use it
wrong
playing sad music when you're sad for
example
don't do it
all right
um you know the word from Maui is that
the governors there's a I guess there's
a head of Maui and then the governor of
Hawaii and neither of them are willing
to say that the number of missing people
who are children
they say it's a it's going to be bad
it's a big number but they're very very
vague and at this point we've all
figured out that they know the answer
it's very clear that they're not telling
us what they know
because
um and in case there's anybody here
who's got a low IQ let's say under 80.
let me explain this
they're not waiting to identify the
bodies
that has nothing to do with not giving
you the information
counting and identifying bodies is not
how you find out what the death gown is
that's not what's going on they have to
do that because they have to do that
right we have to treat the remains with
respect and handle them you know in the
most
in the safest way so everything's about
respect so that don't confuse our
knowledge of who died
with the cleaning up the remains they're
just completely different we know
exactly who's missing it's a small
island and the the people who live there
are the locals right there were probably
very few tourists who died in the fire
um
I don't know that actually
I'm speculating that Lahaina was mostly
locals because if you're a tourist you
just drove away
right if you saw the so so I think most
of the tourists probably got out I think
probably the locals had the the toughest
time mostly now clearly there clearly
there were vacationers who were victims
I just don't know the percentage
anyway here's what I'm getting at
by now
the number of missing is a full list
with actual full names their ages and
even contacts of who their family is
they have a full list of who's missing
it's Maui
if it's better week and you're still
missing on Maui you can't explain that
by cell phones not being good right
on Maui you can walk from one side of
the island to the other in a week
I mean not that anybody would do that
but it's not that big a place if the
thousand-ish people I think they're
saying a thousand fifty if those people
are all on a physical list we know their
names and ages and who the contact is
when when we find remains
so if the governor is not telling you
what percentage our children
it's not because they don't know
it's not because they don't know do you
all get that
you all get that they do know you know
within probably just a few you know
within a few people they do know how
many were children and they're they're
very pointedly telling you they're not
going to tell you the answer to the
question
there's only one reason for that
it's not that they don't know
right
I don't believe it's exactly political
you know you're thinking that I don't
think it's exactly a political thing
I think it's safety
let's just say the obvious it's safety
I don't believe the locals
um
could handle the news
and I don't want to say that something
kinetic would happen if they heard the
news
but you would certainly have to worry
about that you know what I mean so I
don't want to you know I don't want to
say as directly as I could that this is
a dangerous situation now when you say
to me Scott they're acting like we can't
handle the truth
let me say as clearly as possible you
can't handle this truth
you cannot handle this truth
if it's what I think it is and every
sign says it's going to be bad the
locals are not going to be able to
handle it
now maybe you and I can because we have
some distance perhaps but let me tell
you if it was your kid
and you hear what you don't want to hear
that's a very dangerous situation when
people are working as hard as they can
to remediate the situation
so I'm not going to say that I agree
with them not telling you I'm not going
to say I agree with it but if you think
that it would be safe
to tell to tell the public right away I
would disagree with that it's not safe
is definitely not safe to tell the
public what they know
would it be better if they waited a
little bit
probably because if they wait a little
bit they're going to get a better feel
for
the locals
because the locals are absolutely
dangerous at this point does anybody
disagree with that
that presumably the locals are
completely weaponized at this point
yeah now Hawaii is a pretty laid-back
place
but everybody has their limits right
everybody's laid back until they're not
and when they're not they're not it's
you know kind of binary sometimes and I
think we've reached the point where the
locals um
I I don't know if we can even generate
enough empathy
for what this situation is going to
deserve
I don't think I don't think our I don't
think we have the capacity I think this
is going to be on our imagination
unfortunately
so uh the reason I'm telling you
is to warn you
you need to start getting your brain
ready for what's coming
just get ready for it the the The
Knowing is coming is going to help
because you don't you don't want the
shock to hit you it's sort of the cats
on the roof situation breaking into you
slowly sometimes it makes sense to break
it to you slowly
I will say this with a hundred percent
confidence
the authorities will tell us the numbers
they're not going to keep it from you
they're making sure that they tell you
when it's the right time to tell you
that's not that's not a horrible
instinct
I'm not sure I would have done it I made
it I might might have played it
differently but it give them give them a
little bit of consideration
you know I think we should give
everybody a little bit of consideration
here right not everybody's evil people
are trying to do the best they can
certainly now
and I think this is a super tough
situation for the authorities
imagine them trying to do what they need
to do with the extra pressure of you
know what might happen if the full truth
came out right away when when emotions
are at their Peak so I think that they
might want the energy to come down a
little bit before they tell you what
they know
I hate it but I don't know that it's the
worst situation
all right let's talk about Vivek again
there's another
every day you wake up the VAC is
trending on X again he's got another
video saying awesome amusing interesting
things you want to hear funniest thing
was
um
he was asked about the wef
and you have this hilarious routine in
which he hypothesizes that everything
with an acronym is bad
he goes to the list and it just gets
funnier and funnier because you agreeing
with him he's like well you know you got
the everything from the wef to the FBI
to the uh yeah he had an old list of
acronym places to sound
sound bad but
he of course is railing against the wef
and about ESG in particular and I
couldn't love him more for going against
ESG directly and hard and effectively
the way he is
but when I tweet anything about him
there's a type of comment I get from
people who are clearly identified with
the right
and they're creeping me out
and I don't quite understand what I'm
seeing so I want to see if you have some
insight for me right I'll tell you that
the nature of the comments so here are a
few uh I still have a bad feeling about
him
with nothing else I still have a bad
feeling about him
uh he quote came out of nowhere so I
don't trust him
because nobody comes out of nowhere
okay
he's a wef and Soros puppet
despite the fact that his brand is
talking out is speaking against them
this is this is brand he's against ESG
it's the most basic part of his campaign
is that he's against these things and
people who say I think he's working for
them where does that come from exactly
and then somebody today just a few
moments ago said I smell a fink
so there's some number of people on the
right who suspect he's some kind of a
trick or a puppet
or something like that
now let's talk about this one where he
came out of nowhere
is that true did he come out of nowhere
he's 37.
he's 37 and he's already done more than
almost all of you
he's already a successful author uh
entrepreneur
and he's is a candidate who went from
one percent to 11 whatever the numbers
are it's about that
um by Pure Performance
now does anybody think that I work for
the wef
does anybody think I'm a Soros puppet
some too some do there's a yes
I'm gonna assume you're joking I'm gonna
assume you're joking all right
um
but why do I like him
so
and then somebody said that there's no
way he could be doing this well unless
he was backed by powerful forces
that that the Tweeter doesn't know who
they are
is Vivek backed by powerful forces
yes or no
the lake ramaswami is he backed by
powerful forces
yes he is
of course he is
the internet dads
yeah the internet does backup not every
one of them
but there are there are people that
other people take seriously
who are taking him seriously
for example Elon Musk recently tweeted
that you know he's a candidate with a
lot of potential or something like that
he didn't endorse him he just you know
noted his great potential
um I of course have been supporting
and I think you're going to slowly see
some other crop of Internet dads at
least say take a look at him
at least say take a look at him
and you don't think that's a powerful
force
I do
I I think I'm a powerful force
and I back him
so we'll see
anyway
um it all feels racist honestly
my my bottom line is the people saying
I've got a bad feeling I smell a thing
he's a sorrowless puppet he came out of
nowhere I just don't trust him
honestly that all feels racist racist to
me I'm not reading any Minds right I'm
not reading mine so I don't know I'll
tell you how it how it feels
all right so as a Feeling
it feels like it's coming from some
place
um unpleasant you know what I mean I
don't feel like it's coming from this
part of your head I think it's coming
from somewhere down here and
it's not pleasant to see
so I'm not going to blame you all uh
being a racist if if you've got these
vague concerns about them you know maybe
there are some some other source
but uh
it feels creepy to me it just feels
creepy I don't mind that people push
back but you need to push back a little
with a little more meat right you need
to go after the policies but this whole
there's something wrong with him
situation is not feeling comfortable to
me
I think that's coming from the wrong
place
speaking of coming from the wrong place
Andy McCarthy you all know him uh very
respectable
conservative lawyer type
and uh generally one of the people that
we you'll see quoted as is is good takes
so he's sort of a good take person
probably one of the better
maybe a top ten
I'd say he's a top 10 good take
person even if you disagree with him he
has like really well thought outtakes
so it's important to know that he's very
credible
when I tell you this he tweeted very
simple Trump can't win 65 percent
already against him that's before the
Dems launch barrage after getting him
nominated if we finally grasp that his
support will collapse if not we lose
everything and Dems used majorities to
remake Supreme Court nominate him if you
want but that's reality
now do you do you agree with that take
I hadn't heard the 65 percent number
before but
you know it's at least 50.
so
um here's what I think
this sounds a lot like 2015.
do you remember 2015
Trump's negatives were so negative that
there's no way he could win do you
remember what I said when people said
his negatives are way too high he can't
win do you remember what I said
he doesn't have to outrun the bear
he only asked now around Hillary
right
so he only had all he had to do was make
Hillary look worse and so he did and
then he won
so would you say that there's this huge
negative against Trump that that ignores
the fact that whoever gets nominated to
run against them has to deal with Trump
how's that worked out before
Yeah by I think Biden was clearly an
anomaly
I don't think Biden could have won in a
non-pandemic weird hoax-filled year I
mean almost everything was weird about
it but Trump is the ultimate the
ultimate insulter and brander and
minimizer of other people
um once once it becomes a choice between
this Trump guy that so many people don't
like
versus any Democrat
what do you think Republicans are going
to do
stay home
and let Gavin Newsom or Kamal Harris
become president
is that is that your read of Republicans
Republicans would be like ah you know
definitely I'd rather Trump over these
other ones but I guess I'm just going to
stay home
that doesn't sound like a republican at
all it sounds like they would see you
know complete danger if Trump didn't win
so they would act like they're actually
at risk they would act out of fear there
would be actual fear that Democrat
control is is literally dangerous
feels like it it feels literally
dangerous Maui certainly thinks so
all right um
so we'll see we'll see
I just give you the 2015 caution that
we've been here before with Trump
doesn't mean it will repeat because you
know what I say
history never repeats do you know
history never repeats
it can't it's not even possible
it can't repeat
because you're always starting from a
different place
if you're saying that you always get the
same result no matter what the situation
when you start from that would just be
nonsense
history cannot repeat
it it's not even an option
I'll tell you what can repeat
people will always be people
follow the money is probably going to
work in the future
follow the money right that stuff
repeats
people will be selfish devious weasels
yes that will repeat but you can't you
can't know exactly what the outcome is
of the weasleness that part is
unpredictable
all right
um
you I'm getting now the Amazon reviews
for my new book reframe your brain and
there there's always a few types of
reviews that I look for
my favorites
are they I'm smarter than the author
review
I always get them
and they always look the same is
somebody saying oh when I read this book
I uh there were so many things that I
already knew that for me for me it was a
three out of five stars because of the
already knowing everything in the book
but but if I may if you were young let's
say you were 13 this might be quite a
book for you because you unlike me would
not know everything in the book before I
read it
every book I've written has that guy and
he just appeared today I was like Hey
the guy that guy it's about time for
that guy
basically all authors have this uh all
all non-fiction authors have this
there's always that guy who knows more
than the author and the important thing
is the important thing is not the review
of the book
but that this person tells you they know
more than the author that's the point of
the review
so it's just such a narcissist kind of
thing it's very predictable you always
get them the other one you always get I
saw Tim Ferriss doing a reel about this
recently but all authors get this and it
goes like this you'll recognize this one
I used to like Scott
for the other things he did
but I must say
right
the the uh I used to like him the I used
to like him guy
always shows up
they never stay home they always show up
and they used to like him guy is
it's just you wouldn't want to run into
this one at a party
like you don't want to be their friend
in real life
oh
I used to like him but now
and then there's also the the political
ones the people who use reviews just to
get revenge because there's something I
did once that they didn't like
and those you can recognize
for example
somebody called my current book advice
advice
it literally and he said it was like
common sense it was Common Sense advice
it literally is a book that says this is
not advice
it says that much of the reframes are
nonsense but they work it's how to
program your brain it's literally how to
rearrange the structure of your brain
and his take was I've heard this advice
before no it's about the reframe the
reframe is what makes the advice active
how do you read the whole book and miss
the biggest part of the book which
everybody else seems to see pretty
easily
now the reason is he didn't read the
book
it's a negative review of somebody who
picked up the book
here out we use Greg gotfell's new book
as my example this is how this review
gets written
all right uh
uh yeah he's saying he's saying that
people don't succeed every time
well I knew that people didn't succeed
every time so I guess this is a book
full of things that I don't need
that and then he writes a review
so that guy always shows up
all right
um
no one else I saw Adam kinzinger
uh tweeted at that Tucker is a traitor
to the U.S
yep so Adam kinsiger he's a he's in
Congress and uh
says Tucker is a traitor to the U.S
because Tucker was going to talk to some
serbians for an interview
now
here's what would this is just some
advice for Adam I gave him some advice
if you want to call somebody a Trader
there's a way to do it
and then there's a way not to do it a
way not to call somebody a traitor is if
your profile has a Ukrainian flag
sitting equally to an American flag
all right if you're going to call
somebody else a Trader you should at
least temporarily remove the Ukrainian
flag and if you if that's not good
enough you should also get rid of the
phrase that he has that I believe is a
Slava Ukraine
it's lava Ukraine
you know you might want to put in like a
God Bless America
something like that and then just
temporarily get rid of the Ukrainian
flag and then the praise for Ukraine
just just only for the purpose of
calling other people traitors then let a
little time go by you could put it back
nobody will even make the connection
but don't do it at the same time that
you're promoting another country while
you're sitting in Congress in the United
States
I think I made my point
all right I saw this comment from Glenn
Greenwald who is looking at somebody
else's tweet and
I had never considered this and
therefore I feel myself lacking
so I'm chastising myself for not
understanding this take
and it goes like this
this is Glenn Greenwald the group that
by far most supports U.S fueling of the
war in Ukraine is self-identified
liberal Democrats even as Western media
admits the counter-offensive is failing
here's here's the the key part one major
reason is that they loathe Russia due to
2016 and are thus willing to destroy
Ukraine to harm Moscow
yeah holy
that's it
that's it
to the to the left
it looks like Russia got Trump elected
to the left Trump and Russia are the
same Orange Monster
they're the same thing
that never even occurred to me which you
know I I actually am apologizing for it
because it's kind of obvious after you
hear it it wasn't until I read it that
that my brain said what
oh my God that's true
right now I'm not saying every person is
having this you know specific thought oh
Russia Trump but if you ask if you ask
Democrats they'll say that Russia got
Trump elected and that he was trying to
be their friend and you know Russia and
Trump are good buddies because their
news has abused them to the degree that
they actually believe that now my blind
spot is that since I know that's baloney
it never occurred to me that anybody
would see Trump and Russia as somehow
connected in 2023
because it's all been debunked but on
the left they don't get real news they
get the zombie news that never gets
debunked it's like well we said it so I
guess we'll just keep saying it and even
though people are debunking it outside
your bubble you'll never know because
you never leave your bubble
so I really think there's something to
that how many would agree
um
jfj Scott hasn't had any good ideas in
years
oh yeah anyway but how many agree that
uh Russia
uh may look like the big bad enemy to
the left because they think it's Trump
and they and they don't even know that
it's all
they think it's all one big thing
yeah that does make sense
but it also makes me wonder if there's
some way to fix that and I doubt it
because the hoaxes that drive it they
all believe and how do you get them out
of the Republic
now I saw some speculation
uh that one of the reasons that Elon
Musk wants to get rid of blocking is
that it would disable Mass blocking
lists which apparently exist I've never
seen one or participated in one but I
might be on one
uh and
and
um
and I know
could somebody fill in the new guy
on locals
could you
can you fill them in
please thank you
um
what was I talking about which is why
I'm asking you to fill them in
see it derails me there's some kinds of
comments that derail me
so anything about the process
ruins the show
so if I'm in the middle of talking
something and you tell me about the the
lighting being inadequate the sound
being inadequate where I haven't hit the
private button
then my mind goes to process
all right if my mind is in process then
I can't do the show
so
just don't do that so I'd ask the other
locals people just just to let the other
people know
don't do that during the show I mean if
you do it during the man cave or
something then that's different but
don't doing it right in the middle of
the show that's that's a bad idea all
right the block list thank you
um do they exist I'm not sure that's
real
do Democrats have big block lists and
let me ask you the other way is there
anybody who's ever used a block list
I've never even seen one
ccbs's uh answer me have you used one
has anybody used to them
some have used what it looks like Well
it can't be a big thing now so the
question I have is I heard that
you've seen studies that the people on
the left don't see tweets from people on
the right and vice versa
but is that because a block lists I
don't think it is I think that's just an
organic
all right well I have a question on fact
about that to me it seems like the
division or the you know the silos of
information
have more to do with the fact that you
don't follow people you don't want to
follow
yeah it seems like if you don't follow
the other side you're not going to see
their stuff so I don't think that has
anything to do with the blocking stuff
now um
and then keep in mind it's not just
about blocking and muting
Linda yaccarino new new head of Twitter
I've been saying that they're working on
something that would be better than
blocking and muting maybe this
I'll wait and see I'm in favor of any
kind of experimenting that can be
reversed and this would be exactly that
kind
it sounds like it'd be bad for me
it sounds like it
but like I've said before I would not
want I would not want X to base its
policy on what's good for a thin slice
of specific kind of users at a certain
size
you know it should be for everybody I
hate to say it
but my personal preferences should not
have anything to do with policy index
um
what are my top leftist follows
a good question I follow Joe Biden
I think I follow some White House
accounts
um
that's a good question I I know there
have been a number of people
I think I followed George takai
I know but you know suddenly people I
follow are just flamethrowers
you know George takai is is like a
really interesting
leftist
his tweets are really good
um I think I follow AOC
I think I follow sorrows
um
yeah I mean the I think I follow jenk
I think I follow him
kratzenstein's I blocked they were that
I I couldn't handle them Oberman I still
see I don't block him
I don't remember if I follow him I don't
think I follow him
but uh
yeah
Obama probably I think I follow Obama
all right so
um if anybody has you know I'll tell you
what
Ben Garrison uh I'll tell you what if
there are Democrats you think
that I should follow
let me know because it doesn't really
help me
um
 you God damn it
oh
all right I'm gonna end the show now for
YouTube YouTube thanks for joining
