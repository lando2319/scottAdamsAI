foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams it's one
of the finest things you'll ever
experience
um yeah we'll talk about all the
cancellations and all that stuff and
other news too but first wouldn't you
like to take this experience up to a new
level well if you do all you need is a
copper a mug or a glass of tanker
jealous or Stein a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
little pleasure it's a dopamine the
other day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah
all right well I know some of you here
are here to hear about the fireworks of
dilbra being canceled I'll give you the
headline but then I'll talk about it in
in detail after I do some other stories
so the headline is that the way Comics
are distributed there's a syndication
company and then they distribute to the
newspapers that buy it
so a number of newspapers individually
canceled Dilbert but there was a lot of
pressure on the syndication company
so the syndication company decided to
part ways with me completely immediately
and that means that there is no
syndication vehicle
to get Dilbert to any any customers so I
don't I don't personally have any
contracts with newspapers that goes
through the syndication company
now just to be clear
the syndication company didn't really
have any choice because their their
clients were hopping mad and I think the
artists the other cartoonists were mad
and their staff was mad and basically
everybody was bad
uh so they made a business decision
which I don't consider anything like
censorship or anything like that
so I like I like my syndication company
they now no no no they are not cowards
the you could blame the newspapers for
being a little
you know a little skittish but the
syndication company didn't have any
choice they were just forced into it so
don't give them a hard time okay
it's a it's actually a great company
I've been very happy with them for a
very long time
Mark Dice just did something well that's
nice
all right we'll get to uh more of that
in the Whiteboard and all but let's talk
about the headlines so apparently
um there's now General government
agreement
that the covid came from a lab leak in
Wuhan
do I have that story right
there that the government is now saying
as it's like the department of
was a defense or something or energy
I don't know why so but anyway the
government's saying yeah probably are
they saying probably or definitely
it was a little ambiguous
said probably or definitely from the
Wuhan lab
probably right yeah we're only a
probably
um
here's the strangest thing about that
story
I thought we already knew that
we we keep getting news about things
that I thought had already happened
am I the only one who thinks the news
keeps telling me things that's already
happened
like sooner or later there'll be a
celebrity who dies
and you're going to say I thought that
celebrity died a long time ago it's like
news of things you're pretty sure
already happened but it really didn't
all right does it make any difference
that it escaped from the Wuhan lab
well
it does say that Anthony fauci has some
explaining doesn't it
now as Elon Musk pointed out in the
tweet when fauci said that he did not
fund or was not involved in funding
uh gain of
what does it gain a function in Wuhan
apparently it went through Eco health
and then went there so basically it was
like no I didn't fund the lab I funded
this third party who funded the lab
so I don't know if that's going to be
his
Escape Plan
for not lying to Congress because it
certainly looked like you lied to
Congress didn't it
but maybe he's got some technical out
where he can say well technically
I only funded this other thing
yeah I don't know that he lied
he he may have been technically correct
because he chose his words carefully
which is not you know nothing to
celebrate but Maybe
I hear choosing your words poorly can
get you in trouble
I hear that's a thing
all right so I don't know what to say
about that because it doesn't change
anything because what is not in evidence
is that anybody was doing something
intentional
meaning they were doing gain a function
which is dangerous enough but it doesn't
mean they were necessarily trying to
create a weapon
don't know about that maybe they're
trying to defend against a weapon I
don't know maybe
but as Michael schellenberger points out
um that the theory that is now
essentially backed by the government
uh the mass media condemned the lab
League Theory as a quote debunked
conspiracy theory and Facebook censored
people who dared suggest it
you know it's so easy to forget what
happened you know just two years ago
but oh my god did the government abuse
Us in every possible way they could
abuse us they abused us
you know in in hindsight
um also Michael schellenberger in a
tweet points out uh it's clear that the
scientists who claims who claimed in
landsat you know that's a respected
publication on February 19th 2020
quote We Stand Together to strongly
condemn conspiracy theories suggesting
that covid-19 does not have a natural
origin
um
so as Michael shellburger says they were
misrepresenting their unfounded opinion
as a scientific fact
does that sound familiar
doesn't it sound just like the 50 Intel
officials who signed a document about
hunter's laptop and they're all lying
but not tactically
they weren't lying because they said
Well it has all the Hallmarks of all
right
so do you think these uh scientists were
lying
and they knew it when they said uh oh
it's a conspiracy theory
yeah I don't know
um I think it depends on the wording
so they said it was conspiracy theory
suggesting that it came from oh
suggesting it didn't have natural
Origins
but that was just because there wasn't
enough evidence yet
so I'm not sure it's you know evidence
of a lie
all right uh well it looks like the
locals audience is pretty big today
all right uh is China collapsing
I just I read a long thread and who
knows I think it's impossible to know
what's happening in China
but there was a long thread talking
about the demographic collapse and
um some are say that the you know the
population of China is going to start
decreasing really really fast
like by 2050 there could be you know
half as many people living there
like I don't think that's that doesn't
sound right but they're in real trouble
they don't have enough young people and
I didn't realize how many maybe you
could do a fact check on this
you know those ghost cities that are
that are in China and a whole bunch of
like skyscrapers are just empty
and
one of the things I learned and I don't
know if it's true but it might be true
did you know that they were all
purchased
and why
so I am private
oh okay now I'm private
um
so the reason that uh real estate
is all purchased even if people don't
want to live in it is it's one of the
few stores of value
that the Chinese Citizens Trust so
they're not trusting their regular
Investments
maybe not even trusting their Banks but
if you buy real estate
and apparently you don't even furnish it
or even to finish the construction
because it's worth more
if you can sell it and somebody can
customize it themselves so apparently
the Chinese built all these cities sold
all the apartments
but nobody wanted to move in because
they were just Investments and they
didn't want people living in their
apartment because it would make their
investment worth less
talk about a problem
so I I've seen the uh the videos of the
skyscrapers being destroyed
but then I saw a reference to hundreds
of these cities across China
can anybody fact check that
I always I always assumed it was you
know one or two
I just thought it was oh there's this
one or two cities that are ghost cities
but there are hundreds of them people
are saying that's true
hundreds of them hundreds of like
instant cities that are empty and
they're just owned I guess
wow
um oh you're in China
all right buildings are made of chalk
and so the building oh are they also
building them so they're unsafe because
they know they can sell them anyway
oh interesting
yeah they over built but did they over
build because people bought them
the you know over built in some sense
yes
all right well I'm I'm suspicious about
whether China's population will collapse
but all the signs are pointing to it
wouldn't that become one of the biggest
problems in the world
I don't know or maybe it would solve a
problem for China I don't know
um
it was a Rasmussen poll
uh this one probably won't get me in
trouble
uh in which the EPA is saying that the
tests in that Ohio East Palestine town
where the Train derailed they're saying
that the drinking water quality there's
no no quality concerns
but Rasmussen asked people if they'd be
willing to drink the water
only 23 percent of Voters say say that
they would feel safe drinking the water
if they lived near the site where the
Train derailed
23 percent
that's roughly uh
that's roughly a quarter roughly a
quarter yeah so a quarter of the people
would feel comfortable drinking the
water around a toxic cesspool
well good for them right you know I
applaud their confidence
I don't know how about you how many of
you would feel comfortable because the
science says the water is good
science says is good
trust it
would you feel comfortable
I might drink it but I would never feel
comfortable
the water doesn't come from there oh
that is that true is it true that the
water doesn't come from anywhere near
there it's like pumped in from somewhere
else
I'm seeing some nose but I think that's
nose to the other question
still better than Flint yeah maybe
all right well
um let's talk about Katie Hobbs
so apparently there's some kind of uh
hearing or investigation by some private
lawyer
I assume they're working for somebody I
don't know
but there are all these allegations of
the Sinaloa cartel uh
funneling money to politicians in
Arizona including Governor Katie Hobbs
now
I Googled again to see this story
correct me if I'm wrong there's no major
medius covering it
am I right no major media is covering
this
but the hearing is happening right
there's an actual hearing
yeah so it's not it's not a rumor
There's an actual hearing with these
specific allegations and correct me if
I'm wrong
some of the allegations were about the a
company that handles their elections
is that true
now
does that sound like it's likely to be
true
do you think these allegations are
likely to play out as
um true
here's my problem with it
it's a little too on the nose
he has two on the nose it's a little too
much like what you expected it would be
and that I'd never trust that
it's like yeah that's exactly what you
would make up if you were going to make
it up it would sound just like that
so the real world is Messier
so whenever you see something that
uh
[Music]
yeah okay
Have you listened to the information
presented I have not but I also don't
trust it so if I listen to it I don't
know if that would be helping me so
here's what I'm going to do I'm going to
kind of wait to see if the major media
picks it up because even Fox News is not
reporting on it as far as I know
is that right
so if you can't get the even the right
leading media to bite on it I would I
would hold off on my confidence
so I'm going to do
um for Katie Hobbs the innocent until
proven guilty
I mean it's a disturbing allegation
uh how does it sort of somebody ask me
how does it feel to lose all of my money
do you think I lost all of my money
there's almost nothing about this story
about me that's true it's like it's
almost entirely it is now devolved into
like the fantasy story
all right
um Mississippi is the state is looking
to appoint
uh justices
in an area where normally they would be
elected
and the reason they're doing that is
that they think the elected ones must be
corrupt
so there's nothing good happening
and where is it it's a
one it's one area of one community
where is it
why in the world is that not the first
thing that I say oh it's a district
within Jackson
which CNN reports is a majority black
City
so here's my question
if the state has decided that Jackson
Mississippi
is so lost
that they need to appoint judges and by
the way it's being resisted by the
locals who think it's white supremacy
um but would you recommend a young black
man move to Jackson
would you recommend that if you were
giving advice hey young black man
would you move to Jackson
now
right
one says yes one says yes
now is this a a racial comment or an
income
or a class comment
how do you interpret it
Well here here's how it would be racist
it'd be racist if you said don't go
there because there are black people
that would be clearly racist
I don't know how you how it could be
anything else
um but if you said don't go there
because there are poor people
um and that breeds crime and you don't
want to be around that would that be
fair
could you say don't go to a place with a
lot of poor people in high crime
you wouldn't you wouldn't be canceled
for that would you
right so what if you said what I said
that because of systemic racism
things are so bad in the black community
that they're disproportionately likely
to be in poor neighborhoods and it's
such it's so correlated unfortunately
nobody wants us to be true that you
could use it as a proxy of where there's
problems
in the inner cities we're not talking
about you know some rural suburban place
now
using it as a proxy
is that racist
I need an opinion here
if you use it as a proxy it's just one
way to know where there's there's going
to be a lot of crime four systemic
racism reasons
so if you make that correlation but
you're very but you're very carefully
saying I'm not saying anything about
black people
I'm just saying that there's a proxy
situation where so in terms of
information
it would be one rule of thumb now
could that prevent you from going and
living in a place that's majority black
and also high in common no crime well it
would
does it sound like I'm apologizing
there's so many hallucinations that
people are having about me
you should look into well never mind
um so let's talk about uh Dilbert
Dilbert's now fully canceled
um you've probably heard the news that
hundreds of newspapers or some big ones
were canceling but as of yesterday
100 wow
thanks Greg
it's nice of you
um just a compliment there and uh overly
large dip I appreciate it
um
so Dilbert is now fully canceled in all
newspapers calendars books because my
syndication company who does the
newspaper syndication they sell it to
the newspapers and they also provide it
to
um
they also provided to all the uh they
they also do the calendars and the books
so they decided they they couldn't take
the Heat
um by the way I don't blame them it's
not a terrible decision by the way I
don't blame it but all and I expect them
to be professional about it and I will
be professional too
so it's a very long relationship that's
uh ending
and uh but don't give them a hard time
it's the newspapers who pressure them
and they have a business model they have
a responsibility to their
yeah
to the people who work there so there
were a lot of a lot of complaints from
other artists have you ever heard that
artists say bad things about me
have you ever heard that
is the most consistent like artists say
bad things about me anyway so uh Dilbert
whenever that winds down I don't know
how instant it is it will not be
available at dilbert.com I don't think
because I'm not going to manage it and
it won't be available in any form except
whatever's already in stores I guess or
already in the pipeline
so
um
the the media has untethered me
I'm untethered
I'm not sure if they want that but
that's what happened anyway Dilbert will
be available still every day on the
locals platform for subscribers along
with lots of other content
including these live streams
so if you'd like to support
uh let's say I don't know if it's
supporting me or it's a
putting a thumb in the eye of the
newspapers who canceled me one or the
other if you'd like to be part of that
the locals community
five bucks a month if you buy a annual
membership
all right well let's talk about this
issue
um so the canceling if you look at all
the newspapers and also my Syndicate I
would characterize them this way
it was a bunch of rich white people you
know the the leaders of newspapers and
how did this indicate so it's a bunch of
well-off white people
who do not live around black people
and they decided to uh
cancel me
because I thought that what they're
doing is a good strategy
so I agreed I agreed with their strategy
and then they canceled me because nobody
wants nobody wants to ask them where
they live
or why
now again I'm not saying that any of
these people are racist
I'm saying that they probably used a
proxy and said well you know that's one
of the one of the ways you know where to
live and you want to avoid crime not
avoiding black people
that would be racist but just avoiding
uh you know low-income Prime areas
so they've all done that as I've
recommended but they canceled me for
recommending it
um
and now there are a bunch of made-up
reasons
Because the actual thing that people are
mad at me about they all agree with
so nobody disagrees with my two main
claims that you should treat all
individuals as individuals no
discrimination
everybody agrees with that
except racists I guess which I disavow
and then the second point that you
should avoid anything that statistically
looks like a bad idea for you personally
nobody's disagreed with that
have you noticed
the actual claim nobody's disagreed with
not black people in fact the the main
supporters I've seen lately were black
and they were saying yeah if you listen
to it in context it makes perfect sense
and and a number of black people are
telling me they did the same thing
you know they they looked at their
neighborhood and said you know I think
they'll live over here look safer
so I'm getting agreement from Black
uh pundits from White pundits and then
when I asked the people who were mad at
me and mostly is name calling
I asked them what is it you're actually
mad at I'll give you an example when the
my Syndicate canceled me they did a
um press release I guess on social media
and they said that they oppose hate and
discrimination
do they know that was my point
my point was to try to avoid hate and
discrimination that was my entire point
is if if somebody if you believe that
there's a group of people who have a
statistical likelihood to discriminate
against you not any individual
but just collectively there's a there's
an Impulse there then you should get
away from that
and I would call that I specifically
called the people I wanted to get away
from but this was Hyperbole and this is
overstating it everybody who understands
hyperbole knows this was hyperbole
meaning and exaggeration
when I said uh that black people were
like a hate group
and that was based on I'll talk about
that in a moment but it wasn't because I
hated anybody in fact hate wasn't even
part of the conversation was it
but it has has hate been any part of the
conversation
I don't think so because I don't hate
anybody
but I was concerned that somebody hated
me
nobody's specific
so I'm not even sure that hate was right
or I think how about uh
yeah and discrimination is the other
thing I was trying to avoid
so if you avoid discrimination you are
discriminating
is that true
if you avoid discrimination
you're discriminating
it is true
it's definitely true
all right I hear some other people
things people said uh they know what's
in my racist heart because of all of my
years of racist tweeting
which is zero
there is zero any other thing that you
will find anywhere in my Twitter that
would suggest any races or anything
right there's nothing there
and believe me
believe me if there were anything there
you don't think you'd be seeing it on
social media by now it's the first thing
they do they go through your old tweets
and then they show that your new tweet
is part of the pattern have you noticed
that that doesn't exist
have you noticed that the where they go
and they find part of my pattern
is not there
so there are people who think that I
want my entire career and just like
Snapped
or something
so no there are not years of racist
tweets there are zero of them
other people say my big problem is that
I conflated class and race
they said that after I tweeted everybody
knows that class and race are not the
same thing and I treat them differently
who doesn't know that
exactly that's one of my biggest
yeah one of my biggest
public statements is agree with Dave
Chappelle basically that we're treating
uh race as the primary variable but it's
always been economics
every time we treat race as the way to
understand anything
doesn't work
I've said that forever
but class does if you if you look at
class it explains everything
right so uh there's a PhD
fellow who I'm going to talk to a black
gentleman
who wants to talk to me and his his
complaint was
what that's not true
somebody's sending me that my Twitter
account was suspended
that can't be true
let's see you're joking right
no it's still there all right that was a
good prank though but it's still there
still there
all right now
um so I have never conflated race in
class
and and people imagining that I did
nobody does that do they
or if they do it's pretty dumb
um
I'm also accused of uh they know that
I'm a racist they say because of my
right-wing politics
would any of you who have watched me
consider me right-wing
what's your opinion
do I do I present as right wing to you
yeah everybody everybody who knows me
knows the answer is no I'm not
right-wing
left to birdie
all right the other thing they say is uh
uh I called Black Americans a group as I
said but that was Hyperbole and within
within context everybody knows what that
means but it's hyperbole
um
and that I espoused racism
did I espouse racism or did I say you
should try to get away from it
I said you should try to get away from
it
which apparently is racism itself
but what do you do if you
if you can't discriminate
how do you get away from it
or do you just accept it is that a
requirement
all right here's my big question to you
um are there
look let me see if there are any black
Americans watching right now I have a
question for you
I did could you identify yourself any
black Americans
who are watching the live stream right
now just if you're willing identify
yourself because I have a question for
you
all right we got a few
here's the question
if you were looking for a home let's say
you were shopping for a new home or an
apartment
and the place that you were looking at
had a
Republican political signs around it
and let's say you saw the neighbors
wearing you know Maggie hats or
something
would you feel comfortable living there
go
would you feel comfortable in the
neighborhood of red hat wearing
Republicans
I'm saying no Okay so
yeah there's some yeses and there's some
no's some yeses
now suppose
and you know I know I know why there's a
difference let me tell you why there's a
difference
the difference is that conservative
blacks
already understand
um conservatives
so if you're actually a conservative
yourself you understand that they're not
judging you by your color
if you're not a conservative you think
they are
am I right
but but black conservatives know that's
not happening in fact it's the opposite
they they know that in the Republican
side
Republicans are really really strict
about it's not about anything but your
you know your contribution
you know what are you doing it's about
your activities now that's not to say
that there aren't a bunch of racist
uh Republicans
you know they're racists in all groups
but
you saw that in the comments there were
a number of people who said I wouldn't
feel comfortable I'm going to make uh
Teddy the the uh let me talk about the
victim narrative in a minute because
that's that's the NPC comment there are
two NPC comments I'll just say this now
uh one trying to explain the difference
between the between the First Amendment
and private companies deciding to cancel
me
and a lot of people tried to explain
that to me this week
because they think I don't understand
that
now only in NPC like a non-person uh you
know non-player character would believe
that I don't understand that
and that when I say that free speech is
expensive that somehow I've lost the
distinction between private companies
acting and a government rule this is
what you can say and what you can't say
I do understand that
I do
secondly the other NPC comment like the
the lowest level of analysis
is uh that I'm playing the victim
playing the victim
how could I describe this situation
without you saying that
how in the world could I simply
objectively describe what happened
without it sounding like you think I'm
you know I'm a victim
have you heard me say
oh now I won't be able to eat
no no
I'm kind of the opposite of playing the
victim but I am describing what happened
for example I incorrectly tweeted today
that I lost three careers
by being white
and somebody corrected me I was like
shoot I was pretty sure I had that right
the first one was Crocker National Bank
where my boss told me uh that white men
could not be promoted
directly now some people questioned
whether that ever happened and you just
have to ask anybody who lived in San
Francisco in the 80s or 90s it happened
to everybody like it was more like a
universal thing than some weird thing
that happened to one guy
so Crocker Bank said I couldn't be
promoted
and then I went to Pacific Bell
and after a few years they called me in
and my boss
told me directly you can't be promoted
because you're white
and your mail
so I left to become a cartoonist where
it wouldn't matter what color I was
how'd that work out
do you think I would be canceled if I
were not white
I know the answer but just answer do you
think if I were not white
that I would be canceled for saying
exactly what I said saying exactly the
same words
now there's not even there's not even a
small chance
there isn't the slightest chance now
this is purely racial
this is purely racial
you all know it there's not a single yes
going by there's not a single person who
believes I would have been canceled for
If I had not been white nobody
yeah somebody says yes if Asian I
suppose
to run MSNBC are they talking about me
all right
um
so I think we got agreement that it
makes sense to not live with near London
don't live near a population of people
who have been primed to have a bad
opinion of you
does anybody disagree with the statement
that it's good personal uh let's say
strategy
to go where you don't think people are
going to have a bad attitude about you
her says no agreement
let me explain one dissenter I had one
dissenter who said yes I would go to an
area
where uh where I was skeptical of the
people there
did anything I said
sounded like skepticism or a little bit
of you know questioning about him is
that really what we were talking about
because it's a matter of degree
and the people who can't understand it's
a matter of degree
are really missing the whole story
right
now
there are plenty of neighborhoods where
I might be skeptical or suspicious but
they don't rise to the level where it
would matter
but then there are other neighborhoods
where you're not just skeptical you're
scared to death
so if you replace skeptical was scared
for your life
well then you might get a closer answer
but
um
laughs
the the trolls on YouTube are pretty
pretty active and pretty funny today
yeah you all go to Chicago and tell them
you're colorblind somebody says
yeah anyway so I'll go to the uh
whiteboard in a second
um I asked on social media
if people are considering canceling
their newspaper subscription uh because
Dilbert got canceled you want to know a
fun economic fact
it would only take about three people to
cancel their newspaper subscriptions
for for the newspaper to lose money
because the the amount that they paid
for Dilbert
is so small per newspaper
that it would only take a handful of
people canceling that that they would
you know lose more money than they
gained by canceling it
um I also wonder if newspapers are so
close to being completely done that it
wouldn't take much to push him over the
edge
if for example by the way this is a
possibility this is an actual
possibility if for example newspaper
income went down 10 percent
because let's say there was a big
cancellation I don't recommend that by
the way I'm not in favor of boycotts I
don't like boycotts I don't like it when
it happens to me so I don't like it when
it happens to anybody
um
but if hypothetically newspapers lost 10
percent of Their audience because of
this that would push most of them into
the negative
because they're margins have shrunk and
shrunk and trunk the only reason they're
still in business I don't know if you
know this the reason that newspapers are
still in business is they used to have
gigantic margins
and they've they've shrunk to almost
nothing but there's still a little bit
there for some newspapers other
newspapers especially in the chains are
running at a loss
and it's because I'm a hedge fund owns
and they don't mind the loss or whatever
it is but a 10 drop in newspaper
subscriptions
might put half of the industry out of
business
it's a possibility so it's possibility
it's possible that Dilbert canceled the
entire newspaper industry but not a high
chance
not a high chance maybe a 20 risk
um
all right
so I gave an NPC assignment as I
mentioned on Twitter I said write a
write a tweet explaining how the First
Amendment doesn't apply to private
companies and I actually labeled it NPC
assignment
and then in the comments
you have to see how many people
sincerely tried to explain to me that
the First Amendment doesn't apply to
private companies
after I'd give them an NPS NPC
assignment to do it they did it
and not ironically
they thought I needed to know
all right
um and then this is my favorite critic
some individual who thinks he's gonna
Kyle Parrish who's running for congress
I guess North Carolina Fifth District
and I I don't like his chances
based on his tweet I don't like his
chances of getting elected so he said
how long before Scott Adams uh
Let's uh post a rant about men needing
to separate from women because they all
hate him
and I thought to myself
well
I've sort of already done that
you know not the hate part but I've
already endorsed the Mike Pence don't
have you know a meal with somebody who's
not your wife unless your wife is there
and it's for the same reason it's
exactly the same thinking
the thinking is while any individual
woman is fine
but the class of the the category of
people called women
have been uh very much let's say
programmed by the metoo uh narrative
which is you know a healthy a healthy
thing for society to have that but if
you're trying to avoid a class of people
who have been programmed by Society
women would be one of the groups so I do
recommend that you stay away from women
in a certainly in a work environment
where you're alone
so I wouldn't I wouldn't spend a time
alone with women
because women have been radicalized by
The Narrative to look for me tooing and
they're going to find it where a man
won't
if you spent the same amount of time
with men
your odds of being metooed would be
practically zero
if you spend a lot of time with women in
the workplace what are your actually
I'll ask you this if you if you have a
job where you personally spend a lot of
time with women
what are the odds you'd be accused of
misogyny or sexism
I think it's close to 100 isn't it
yeah if you're surrounded by women in a
work environment
for an extended period of time I would
say the odds go to 100 percent
so would it be good advice to ignore
that
or would it be a good advice to do what
Mike Pence does
and make sure everybody has equal
opportunity don't don't treat any woman
as there's something wrong with her
that's not fair
but just
treat it like a statistical fact
how about that
so that's bad uh critiquing if I agree
with you all right let's go to the
Whiteboard
I was reading CNN's uh
take down of me today
and I think so far the Press has done
the same trick and the trick is to use
just my quote
and to ignore the context which I
healthily added afterwards
so if you only concentrate on the quote
you can make it mean anything you want
but if you look at the context
it's harder
so I don't believe let me tell you what
the Washington Post did
oh my God thank you
uh uh right I I don't encourage you to
do gigantic
um
super chats but Ryan I appreciate it
all right uh here's what the Washington
Post did
if you heard my comments in context
they're they're much easier to go down
right that's why a number of black
pundits have looked at my comments in
context and then concluded oh that's
fine
I don't know if you know that but black
black people who are looking at it in
context are fine with it and they're
telling me every day privately and also
on Twitter
right now the ones who haven't looked
into the context
they're they're pretty worked up
they're pretty worked up
so here's what the Washington Post does
they start with the story of what I said
which is the thing that gets everybody
riled up they do add a little context
but it's at the end
if you have it at the end that's a hit
piece
right because they could have added it
at the front all you'd have to do is cut
and paste just cut the end put it up at
the top
here's how the story could have read
Adams made the following comments then
just show the comments
people interpreted it to be racist
Adam's uh addressed those comments the
following way
and then people who saw the comments
addressed decided it was actually
helpful
did I did I lie
is any of that a lie
it's not if you just said here's here's
the context
here's his additional explanations
people have looked at it are happy that
it wasn't racist or not what they
thought it was anyway and and that's the
end of it but but there's still uh an
outrage
would any of that be untrue it wouldn't
be now the way they wrote it was also
completely true
but it was written to mislead
intentionally
so look at the stories today Story
number one
the media and social media especially
lied to you about the source of the
Wuhan virus
right that's the media and now they're
lying to you about me but they're doing
it in this clever way where they just
arrange the information so it it's
presented as a lie but there are no lies
in it
there are no lies in it anywhere but
it's organized to present a lie
um
all right so here's here's the thing and
you can check this yourself
check any of the major media coverage of
me and see if you can find them
describing my explanation
of why the Rasmussen pole wasn't the
important part of the the thing
so by the way a number of people have
said hey that's just one poll
yeah we can't rely on one pole and
they're right
and I should have been more clear that I
was using the poll as a let's say an
introduction to the topic
but the bigger reason is not the poll
you could take the poll out of the story
and my point would be the same
but my uh
but my messaging would probably be
better so here's the real messaging
which I didn't do a good job of you know
in my off the cuff stuff we know we have
a situation in this country
in which
um there are indications of racial
discontent so there's Erasmus and pole
which we all agree cannot be relied on
just by itself
but I suppose the Rasmussen poll was off
by
a hundred percent
that'd be pretty big wouldn't it a poll
that's off by 100 so let's say that
instead of you know nearly half of black
respondents not being willing to say
that uh being white is okay that was the
poll
I suppose it was only half of that
or or the part or let's say I take out
the part of people who are just
unwilling to answer it
and just say well that's something
different
so suppose it's half that size
suppose it's a quarter of black
Americans thought about it and said yeah
I'm not willing to say being White's
okay would that change my point
you know would the larger point be
different
if the Rasmussen poll was off a lot like
just way off it wouldn't be any
different at all
but it also is very much in agreement
with a Gallup poll from a few years ago
this shows that race relations took a
dive I think around the time of Trayvon
Martin
and when the media found that they could
get a lot of money by gining up racial
hatred
so if you look at the the the Gallup
poll of race relations it sort of is
flat for years just years flat flat flat
Trayvon Martin and then it stays low
after that
why did it stay low was it just because
of one story
no it's because the media decided that
that kind of story
was the kind that really gets people
going
so the media decides that to feed us you
know non-stop white people are racist
stories because it's really good content
then you add to that the Eis and the Dei
and the uh the training that is now the
major narrative the thing that schools
are teaching the kids and the things
that corporations or corporations are
talking about and they're creating a
narrative
uh collectively and then social media is
a big part of this of course so if you
had the media I should have said media
not social media but if you add all
these forces they created narrative and
I won't say what the percentage is
but there is some amount of the black
population that's poisoned
they're just poisoned by the narrative
they are victims
they are literally victims now the white
population is just as much victims
you know in a different way because the
media is not telling us anything like
the truth
they didn't tell us about the Wuhan
virus right pretty much was it or
another story oh the Katie Hobbs story
I'm not sure that that's even true
we'll find out
don't know if the collapsing China is
true we don't know if the Ukraine war
stuff is true basically the media is
unreliable I guess you know that so no
matter what this populate what
percentage of the black population has
been poisoned by this narrative would
you agree with the following statement
that all of these forces are pushing it
into more
like whatever it is now it's there's
going to be more of it because the
forces that caused it are all in play
agreed all right so if you imagine that
the black population is victim which I
believe they are
victims
of
uh programming that is not in their best
interest
it looks like it's in their best
interest because you know the equity and
the fairness and stuff and there's a lot
of good there's probably a lot good in
there I'm not going to say it's all bad
right I'm just saying if you haven't
accounted
for the cost of it then you're not done
with the analysis
the benefits are obvious hey we'll treat
everybody better I like that
the cost is that there's a cost on the
white population
because they're demonized by the you
know the collective forces here
and that there is a predictable response
the predictable response at least one of
them should be to put some distance
between people who have been victimized
and are therefore weaponized
here's another word for it I would say
that the media and our education system
are weaponizing
part of the black population
to and not necessarily physical weapons
I'm talking about intellectually
weaponized
to have a
have an immediate uh
racial frame on things that maybe you
don't need a racial frame on okay
so that's the story so everybody who
says uh Scott you relied on Rasmussen
they're correct in their criticism that
the way I presented it looked like I was
relying on that that's a good criticism
but it's not I wouldn't have brought it
up except for this right this is the
reason I'm talking about it the
Rasmussen was you know just a sideshow
it was just an introduction to the topic
so here's what happened
see if this sounds familiar
to anything else you've ever seen happen
in public
here was the initial crime I advised I
gave some advice that everybody agrees
with
I gave some advice
that everyone agrees with black people
white people poor people rich people
everyone
literally everyone
and was it useful
was it useful
is it useful to know the costs and the
benefits of your policies or do you only
want to know the benefits
is useful
right well actually let me say maybe it
didn't turn useful
but the intention
the intention of everything I do on
Livestream is to allow people to think
more productively so that their lives
are better
does anybody doubt that
is right by here who thinks
that I'm doing any of this for money
like this stuff
it would be the worst way to make money
do you know how I make money or I used
to
keep my mouth shut and make Dilbert
comics
that's how you make money
that was a really good way to make money
I mean it ended it ended yesterday
but
uh so I'm unemployed at the moment I
guess this is monetized so
sort of a little bit
uh ego so he says ego
am I doing it for ego
it's a trick question
do I do this for ego
no you're too kind the answer is yes
but as I've told you many times I never
do anything for one reason
I never do anything for one reason I
mean there might be some exceptions but
I wouldn't do this for one reason
so people are saying hey ego
to which I say yes if I do good work
that people appreciate my ego will be
satisfied
see that's that's looking at all the
variables so I'm trying to be consistent
and look at all the variables
all right
so I gave some advice that everyone
agrees with that if there's a population
of people that has a has been programmed
this is the important part has been
programmed
to have a a feeling about you
this would include women in the B2 era
so in the Mike pen sense you should
avoid them it would include people who
have Trump signs and mega hats if you're
black
I would say maybe avoid that
neighborhood
is that bad advice
now I know most of you who are if you're
Trump supporters you say but wait we're
not racist don't do that and I agree
virtually I I don't know you don't mean
many racist conservatives you just don't
at least not in the sort of public
sphere
um but
is there anybody who would say
that there are no races in the
Republican world would anybody say that
there are no racist Republicans
now remember
one now they're racists in every group
they're clearly racists in every group
so if you were black should you take
into consideration that your neighbors
have a republican signs in the in the
yard
should you take that into consideration
well if you're a black conservative it's
a plus is you actually probably would be
treated better than most people if
you're black and left-leaning
you might have some
some hesitance
wouldn't you
now in all of these questions it's got
to be a matter of degree doesn't it if
your problem with another group was just
was somebody said skepticism
I wouldn't I wouldn't change where I
live because of some vague skepticism
uh and like likewise I would say that
Republicans are actually a pretty good
group to live around
so if you used your you know if for most
people it'd be a good place to live
but you might have uh feelings
that that group had been let's say
weaponized by the media
because a little bit of that is
happening there there's so many uh
videos going around of black people
beating up non-black people if you were
black does that worry you
oh let me ask that question
that's a good question
the the videos that get viral they seem
to be and there's one going around to
the black student beating a teacher
nearly to death
it's all over the place wouldn't you
agree those of you who are black who are
watching this wouldn't you agree that's
bad for you
that's like programming white people to
have a view that's not represented
right so what do you say that the
problem
is people being programmed
with uh bad thoughts now if you saw more
and more just hypothetically let's say
you're black and you saw more and more
of these videos and every one of them it
seems like oh my God it's like they're
really going after us now
wouldn't you think twice before you
moved into a neighborhood that you
thought had been programmed with that
frame of mind
I mean it seems like a reasonable thing
to do and yet they would say nothing
about all Republicans would it
would say nothing about all Republicans
it would just say that this is a group
of people who have been programmed
and especially lately
they've been programmed to have a let's
say a reflexive bad feeling about me so
wherever there are groups of people who
have been programmed programmed by the
media to have a reflexive bad feeling
about you I would avoid them
does anybody think that's a bad idea
anybody
no matter no matter what color you are
and no matter what is the you know
characteristic of the group you're
talking about
if if they've been programmed to not
like you by the media is that a factor
you should consider
right
so here's what happens so now now you
can see how the media works so I said
something that literally everyone agrees
with once they see it in context I I
will accept the criticism that I was not
as clear as I could have been
does everybody agree with that
I'm accepting that criticism that I gave
too much attention to one poll didn't
change the message but I gave too much
attention to it and
uh and I wasn't clear
yeah those things I can just be guilty
of that's fine but once you saw the
context
and especially people who know me
personally
they were they were pretty sure that it
was just good advice all right so I got
canceled everywhere uh there will be no
more Dilbert except on the locals uh
subscription platform
and then what happened then the cover-up
starts
because little by little more voices are
saying wait a minute what did you cancel
him for
okay I feel like I'm not getting the
whole contacts here
so I'll just tell you that a prominent
member of the media somebody whose name
you would know
who is black
uh contacted me today and said okay
there's something going on here because
my interactions with you suggest that
what you said in public doesn't make
sense like I like it was somebody who
thought that the person that they had
interacted with me
was inconsistent with a story that's in
the media
that's a media expert somebody who
literally lives and breathes the media
every day and looked at it and said this
doesn't look right
right
now as I told him his Instinct was good
there's something wrong here
's what's happening
so the the papers and everybody was
canceled me they canceled me from their
first impression
which I admit was awkward and it could
have been done better
once they realized that within context I
was simply giving advice that anybody
would agree with black or white
the cover-up begins because they're not
going to change the mind so you know
they're not going to change the minds
that would be too dangerous
so now they're saying that he said all
black people
are haters
did anybody hear me say that
because that's what the news is saying
now
or the people who believe they've seen
the news and so now they've turned it
into all
is there any scenario where I've ever
said that all members of a group have
some one thing in common ever
who would say that besides stupid people
like this isn't this isn't even racist
that would be just stupid
wouldn't it like wouldn't that be
literally just dumb
if you believed all of the members of a
group are thinking the same in fact
how many times have I said out loud or
tweeted
that all black people are not the same
all we've talked about all Hispanic
voters completely varied white voters
all over the place but do you believe
that I would imagine the Hispanic voters
are diverse and white voters are diverse
but black people are not
I mean who would have that opinion
nobody right so if you believe that I
had said this something about all black
people
you really need to check your reading
comprehension
and your news source
right uh
because nobody would say this
you know the the imagine if you can
imagine there's somebody in 2023
would have this point of view that
there's something about all black people
that's negative like all of them
no but literally nobody has that point
of view nobody
right but yet people have imagined that
I could have and said it out loud
um the one poll is unreliable but it
doesn't really relate to my point so
they have to make this poll uh they have
to artificially make it seem as if the
poll is the only thing I was keying off
of which it wasn't but I didn't clarify
so that's that's a good point
uh and then here's their best trick
they introduced the topic by calling it
a racist rant or a racist tirade
if the title of the article says racist
rant or racist tirade
is the media telling you the news
nope that's not the news that's a
narrative
that's that's that's an interpretation
is what that is and so the Washington
Post went you know full not fake news
but intentionally misleading news I
don't know what you would call that is
it fake if the facts are true but they
leave out context to reverse the meaning
it's kind of a fake news situation but
not exactly
right so this is uh this is what's by
week will look like
so all week nobody will disagree with me
I predict because nobody's going to
disagree with this
in private nobody disagrees black or
white nobody it's completely agreed
but they're going to turn it into
something I didn't say or something I
didn't rely on entirely or they're going
to label it so nobody knows what you're
thinking
that's how it works so if you're
wondering how the media cancellation
machine works
that's how
um
Anthony you're not wrong
explain how that's a hate group isn't
referring at all do you know what
hyperbole is
sir
so I was asked the question explain how
it's a hate group does not refer to all
of them
it would be the same way that I believe
that whites have been called the hate
group
Am I Wrong have have whites been called
a hate group because they're allegedly
so many white supremacists
can anybody find uh do you think if you
looked on social media do you see
anybody referring to white people as a
hate group
now if they did how would I interpret
that let's say theoretically somebody
said white people are a hate group what
is the reasonable way to interpret that
is the reasonable way that it means
everybody
is that reasonable is that good reading
comprehension I think he means every
person
or would you recognize hyperbole
and say oh he's making a point that
there are too many people in that group
who have negative views I don't know
what the percentage is but it's too many
right
so does anybody else have a question on
that
is that unclear
that hyperbole is an exaggeration that
people are supposed to recognize
in other words when you use hyperbole
you're you're saying something that's
technically not true
but you assume that everybody's a good
enough reader that they know what you
mean right
so let's say I say uh Republicans like
God
does that sound like all Republicans to
you
the the Republicans let's say
Republicans are religious
if I said that in public would you take
that as all of them
that's an actual question would you take
that as all of them
it's the way people talk
it's just a shorthand hyperbolic way to
talk about a group to make a point now
um
sounds like you do
yeah exaggeration is nearly 100 of
political discourse that's true
yep it's the way people think I don't
think anybody thinks in 100 anything
so generally it's the thing I get in
trouble for is
47 context yeah
Jet Magazine
I would ask do you mean most Republicans
yeah but what do you even need to ask
would you need to ask me if I met most
Republicans so that's my point
it's completely clear
hyperbole or exaggeration in this case
it's very clear what it is so you
shouldn't have to explain something
that is ordinary conversation hyperbole
but I do I do understand that people
um
can be fooled by it
no my uh my art director is still
employed
uh so Dilbert will still be created I'll
just be putting it on the
um locals platform
so you can find that at scottadams Dot
Scott Adams one
word.locals.com it's a subscription
platform
uh
boss says admit you felt like that your
whole life
uh felt like what my whole life I never
felt like the narrative was poisoning
black Americans
and that's that's really the Catalyst
for
the entire opinion so it's more like
what things have become and where
they're heading
all right
47 is too high
do you know that there is no apparently
there's no research on that
did you know that apparently there's no
research on the actual black attitudes
of white people except the Rasmussen
Bowl which I agree you know one bullet
doesn't tell you everything you need to
know
uh
uh five minutes to post it on Twitter
yeah
so here's why there's going to be a
little uh time lag and what's happening
has anybody noticed that the the
punditry is starting to turn my way
does anybody noticed that
day one it's all negative
but if you notice that people are
starting to deal with it the actual
question
yeah yeah the punditry at least on the
right is turning my way
uh but also both black and white
so and honestly
uh if this is going to sound super
racist but I'm gonna say it anyway
because yeah why not
uh the the black men who have looked at
this situation have been the closest
to understanding it
the black men for some reason the black
women who are weighing in have very
different opinions from the black men
you know maybe sort of generally in the
same direction but the way they express
is totally different and the black
manner mostly saying
I want to hear more that they're
actually interested in the content
they'd actually like to know and then
when they hear it they're like oh that's
a good point
that's the way it's going
so I guess that's racist because the the
black men have been generally the the
quickest to figure out what's going on
here
and I have a theory for that which is
that black women fear fear have more
risk
than black men in terms of just physical
social risk
and so if it sounds like you know you're
in a group that's getting some bad press
if you're a woman I think you'd be more
concerned
just because you you have physical
safety as well as everything else and I
think if you're a man you just worry a
little less about physical safety so you
can engage with the content a little bit
better
just a theory
yeah it might be a misogynistic Theory
remember it's just a hypothesis so if it
were
if it were a statement effect I would
have no grounding for it
all right uh
putting his own interest first and that
what
I said out loud that I'd be putting my
own interest first oh no I said
everybody should
I said everybody should put
is that wrong
that everybody should take care of their
own business and their family
uh
Disney just removed the TV series Disney
didn't have the TV series did they
are you saying that Disney had the TV
series
Hulu might have been on Hulu
you mean on Hulu right
not at Disney
but here's a little fun fact the Dilbert
TV show didn't make me money I mean
after the initial some initial money but
all of the uh the reruns uh that that
money gets Hollywood stolen
and what I mean Hollywood stolen they
calculate that their expenses were
greater than their revenue and they give
you nothing
but everybody knows that's going to
happen
yeah it's not on Disney Plus
maybe you meant Hulu
might have been there
and he packed on the dill burrito
yeah Disney was Hulu
uh
what was it all right
um on YouTube
did you see some commenters slam you for
quoting Don Lemon
uh what what way were they slamming me
because they don't like Don Lemon
uh yeah we'll get past all this business
pretty soon let's see Jackson says
you're basing this off of liberal polls
and viral videos
uh we mostly get along someone who's
believing woke stuff and get to know
them and challenge them instead of
running them you're based so so you're
missing everything I just said
Jackson you spend twenty dollars but you
missed everything I just said you're
saying this you're basing it off a
liberal poll no that was like the last
10 minutes saying I wasn't doing that
uh
and viral videos and I'm saying that the
viral videos
are misleading
which is what you're saying
so so here's here's the pattern the
pattern of the people who think they're
disagreeing are imagining something to
disagree with
and they're generally just agreeing with
me
did I watch Greg and Bill no
uh
oh my God
oh yeah we got a lot of viewers today
good for that all right is there
anything else going on that I haven't
talked about oh you're tired of talking
about me
uh
you are free now bring down the entire
establishment
how many hours of sleep do I get usually
four-ish
four hours or so
uh
yeah well you know the media picked up
Elon musk's comment and you know
Associated that with my story but I saw
his comment as more opportunity to
comment about the media and you know
less about my specific comments or my
situation
but I you know I appreciate that he made
a comment that you know enhances the
conversation so to speak
yeah so my Twitter users are uh going
crazy
so I might reach a million users
maybe in a few months we'll see
all right
um I think that's All For You on YouTube
I'm going to go talk to the locals
people for a little bit and
that's all for now
bye for now
