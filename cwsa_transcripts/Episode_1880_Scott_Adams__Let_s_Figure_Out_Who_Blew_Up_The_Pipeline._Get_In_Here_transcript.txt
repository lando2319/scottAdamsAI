do I see him unprepared
well you're right you're gonna send this
tweet and then
you gotta send this tweet and I'll be
right with you
watching the cartoonist tweet that's the
entertainment for the day
boom
boom
all right everybody
finally I'm here
you know
one of us was going to be late today and
I'm glad it was me because you're all on
time because you're awesome and you'd
like to take it up a level and I think
we can do that with a little thing
called the simultaneous sip are you
ready for the simultaneous all you need
is a cup or a mug or a glass of tanker
chalice is done a canteen jugular flask
of vessel of any kind
certainly with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the don't be here the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
now if you didn't already know
the official coffee with Scott Adams mug
is available for pre-order
who have a little drawing of my bald
head on the front
it'll have the simultaneous sip on the
back
and it will have the words ah on the
bottom
now
you uh the link is uh you can see the
link in my Twitter feed today
and I have to tell you that the it turns
out that the shipping and packing costs
are the majority cost of the mug so it's
a big old thick heavy mug so it's a you
know a substantial mug but that the
biggest cost is keeping it from being
broken while they're shipping it
so we we all wanted it to cost about
half as much but unfortunately the
shipping just eats that up
and uh it's heavy ceramic and it will
work on your coffee heater just fine I
believe we have already have over over
70 of them have been ordered since I
just tweeted it
we should be blowing through our minimum
guarantee pretty soon
and uh all right you order two good good
um I guess I need to order mine I need
to get one too
all right well I'm going to start with
the best story of the day
so CNN had X CIA director Brennan to
talk about the Ukraine situation
and he notes that Russia seems to be
losing losing everything and it's all
falling apart for Russia
and uh he believes that Russia
sabotaged the nordstream 2 pipeline
which is Russia's own pipeline
now it had been turned off already so
they'd turned it off so it wasn't
delivering any gas
uh so although it was not delivering any
gas
John Brennan thinks that uh Putin blew
it up
to really send a strong signal
to the the west and I think it did now a
lot of people don't know where he got
where Putin got that strategy of blowing
up his own assets
it's originally there was a military
genius who came up with this first it's
sort of non-obvious right you're like
why why would you blow up your own
valuable asset
but no it came from this is actually a
military Doctrine it's it's more obvious
than things so there was a famous
military strategist named Mel Brooks
and in his military treaties uh treatis
Treatise Treatise it was called I
believe it's called Blazing Saddles
and there's a scene in there in which we
learn to you hold a gun to yourself
and you threaten to kill yourself
Sometimes using you know unpleasant
language if you threaten to kill
yourself then people won't kill you
like okay I I'm gonna kill this person
okay Mel Brooks Used different language
so I think is really it looks like the
Mel Brooks play I think Putin is uh
threatening to destroy all of his assets
maybe one at a time if if we don't give
him what he wants
um
so that seems quite reasonable uh John
Brennan
now talk about a credible guy
John Brennan was one of the people who
helped collect the 50 Intel prior and
current Intel people
who
who said that the Hunter's laptop was
Russian disinformation
yeah he's also the same John Brennan who
pushed the
Russia collusion Oaks
but there's no reason to believe that
he's lying this time when he says that
Russia attacked itself to teach us a
lesson and let me tell you
I feel it
I feel a little bit closer to
maybe Ukraine will have to surrender
I mean if Russia keeps bombing its own
assets
I don't know if any of us are safe
I mean what if Putin decides to bomb
Moscow next
what are we going to do
would Ukraine Just Surrender I mean
the strategy looks pretty strong
so yeah Russia will be attacking itself
because attacking Russia or I'm sorry
attacking Ukraine didn't work out at all
uh I think Putin needed to win
he's like okay have we attacked anything
successfully lately
ooh
you know the uh the news from the Don
Bass
not so good not so good okay we need to
have some kind of a win can you please
attack something successfully I need to
be able to say we attacked something and
we got it we got the wind
well you know the ukrainians are really
dug in
don't tell me what you can't do
I need a win
you need to blow something up and I need
to be able to say that I got that thing
you know we're running out of weapons
and our soldiers are not really well no
no
I need you to blow something up and give
me a win
well you know the only thing we could
actually blow up
would be our own stuff
I don't need to know the details just
give me a wind
so then the Russian general said all
right what's the least protected thing
we owned and they thought
our pipeline we could blow that damn
pipeline up
so Putin gets the win for a successful
military operation against its own
pipeline
according to John Brennan
has he ever lied to us
I mean
you can trust John Brennan right
I mean just because he ran an
organization whose entire job is lying
to us
and he's documented as the biggest liar
in American politics
Bar None bar none
but this time he's totally uh telling
the truth
but the funniest thing was watching I
think it was uh
Keeler uh on CNN who asked Brennan uh
why he thinks that Putin blew up his own
pipeline
to teach the West the lesson when the
pipeline they could just turn it off
she was like you could just turn it off
you have to blow it up
uh then I saw some speculation that
really it was a clever trick and the and
that Brennan is right
and here's why they blew it up because
if Putin had not blown it up
he might be legally required to turn it
on later to fulfill legal contracts
so to get out of his legal contracts
later he blew up his own pipeline
now if there's one thing that we know is
true
Putin is very concerned about his legal
agreements
and he would be willing to bomb his
entire country
so that people didn't think he'd be the
kind of guy who'd say one thing and then
do another because that's not the kind
of reputation you could have out there
perfectly reasonable
perfectly reasonable
because you know
prior to knowing that Putin was bombing
his own pipeline according to John
Brennan
I didn't know if Putin was trustworthy
or not
you know I didn't know if you could
depend on him to keep a deal
but now that I know he would be willing
to bomb his own assets
to get out of a deal
well I trust him more and I think that's
what he was going for he was going for
some kind of a business credibility kind
of a play and I think when you see
somebody blow up their own assets so
they don't have to deliver what they
promised
that makes me trust them
so so I think this hypothesis that
Russia is behind the blowing up of their
own asset completely feasible
completely I buy it
yup totally believable
now as a backdrop to this and don't make
too much of a big deal about this
because we know what the story is we
know Russia blew up their own assets
because John Brennan would never lie to
us on CNN that's something we know for
sure
but some people you know there's always
some Rogue
there's always something like goofy
bastard who's got some conspiracy theory
 right so here's the conspiracy
 that's going around now there's
a video of Joe Biden before the Ukraine
invasion
saying in public I know it's ridiculous
but saying in public in the clearest
possible terms
that if Russia invaded those pipelines
were no longer going to be functional
now some people say that matters
and the fact that he directly that Biden
directly said if you do this
we're going to take care of those
pipelines
and he gave you a smile that looked
exactly like he meant blowing them up
because there's a smile that says I mean
blowing them up right you have to see
the video
here's how you talk if you don't mean
blowing them up
uh Mr Biden are you saying that you're
gonna you know shut down those pipelines
yes we'll we'll use whatever means we
can we're going to shut down those
pipelines
okay that's how you say it if you don't
mean we're going to blow them up
here's how you here's how Biden said it
so how will you do it
I promise you we can do it
now that's pretty much the blow it up
face isn't it
I mean I think he told us he's going to
blow him up and then they blew up
now to me this looks like nothing but
giant energy companies
uh manipulating our government to reduce
the competitiveness of their competitor
that literally is all I see here do you
see anything except a giant Energy
company has control of our military
and the military is doing the bidding of
some Energy company in the United States
that's what it looked like to me it
looked like it literally was a
commercial
a commercial operation to increase the
prophets of American gas companies
now
I think that's the reason it happened
also
maybe has some military you know
Homeland
European protection whatever I mean that
might be good too but you know when
follow the money works this well
if you can follow the money this
directly I don't know if you need to ask
any about their questions I mean to me
to me this doesn't even look like a
national interest so much as just a
Energy company interest
now you could argue and I'm going to
argue this
that when the United States
supports its energy industry
even doing things that you might think
are over the line or sketchy or too far
or whatever
that the United States does better
you know that there are a lot of smart
people who say basically look at the the
energy situation of any country and you
know everything you need to know
that's pretty close to true isn't it if
you've got a country that has cheap
energy or is a major producer of energy
they seem to always be doing fine
so if you take care of your energy
business
your country is going to be a strong
country if you don't take care of your
energy business and you have to buy
energy from other people and that's all
you have you're just a buyer of energy
you're going to be very vulnerable
so
um I'm not sure that it is the wrong
that is wrong for the country to do
things that are literally just good for
big energy companies in the United
States
no it's it's like you know it's creepy
and it's unethical and it's it's not
free markets you could find a hundred
ethical and moral reasons why we
shouldn't do it
easily right it's not it wouldn't take
any effort at all
at the same time
having our government and our Energy
company is basically being one entity
and working for each other's benefit
actually kind of works kind of works
yeah I I mean I don't like it
but strangely it works
all right
um
can we can we do this next conversation
without
without some of you just flying out of
control
okay see if I can just get through this
next two minutes
without somebody just going nuts on me
okay
so there's the there's a trending
hashtag for face masks no I hate face
masks I am anti-face Max I hate them and
we're not going to talk about the
science
however
it is trending again because cases are
up and and people are pushing for her
face masks again now in this context
some doctor uh
some doctor tweeted the studies that he
says support face masks I retweeted it
with a comment on just the messenger now
the way you should take that when I say
I'm just the messenger
that means I'm not endorsing it
that's how you should interpret it if I
say hey look at this this looks pretty
solid then I'm probably endorsing it or
at least I think there's nothing wrong
with it but if I say I'm just the
messenger
you should very clearly see
that I'm just telling you whether other
people are saying so you know
because I had always wondered why it is
that the people on the right
say there are no there are no studies
that support masks
and the people on the left say there are
tons of them they're all over the place
have you ever wondered about that like
why could it both be true that
there are tons of studies saying they
work at the same time there are no
studies to say they work
and both be true
so I think I think maybe I have
something close to an answer
which is this list of studies it was
sort of a study about other studies of
masks
it it took about 10 seconds
for you know Andre's back house and
other people who know about data to just
rip it about is ridiculous
so apparently this study happened at the
very beginning of the pandemic
when all of our data was bad and
basically it was just a use it was a
bunch of useless studies
they were summed up by another useless
study
now
if you were non-critical
and you saw that there were a whole
bunch of studies in the same direction
what would you do if you were not very
let's say sophisticated about how people
lie with data
I think it would be pretty convincing
now let me stop again because I know a
whole bunch of people are flying crazy
at home no I'm anti-mask and I have been
from the start
but the conversation about it is part of
the context of America so I can't avoid
it
so I think I think that's the I think
the entire thing comes down to this
I think the entire thing comes down to
the people on the left believe the
studies
because there are lots of them
but the people on the right don't
believe the studies because when you
look at them they don't seem credible
you know they just don't seem to be a
time period and it doesn't look like
they could
untangle all the confounders you know
all the variables that could affect them
I mean the most obvious thing is that
the people who are likely to wear masks
have something in common with each other
right
and the country is most likely to do it
they probably have something in common
as a country so I just don't know that
you can sort it out
I also don't believe
that they would have kept in the study
anything that said the opposite
right because when you do a study of
studies let's say a meta study or even
just a study of studies which would be
different
you're you are deciding what's in and
what's out
what they never do is throw everything
in
because they always say well you know
this one is so big you don't want to put
this one in there it'll skew things or
they'll say this one is so low quality
that even though the other ones are
higher quality
you know we'll throw it out so so those
studies end up being subjective
accidentally
some meta studies are well made some are
not right and usually we can't tell the
difference
can't tell the difference all right so
is everybody comfortable that I'm
anti-mask period
period anti-mask
but now you understand why the left
believes they work
because there are people
sending studies around it is sort of the
laundry list thing if there are enough
studies it doesn't matter that they're
all bad
because there are lots of them
so I think that's the whole story
anyway
um
so the
the January 6th gasolators this this
just amazes me because every once in a
while you have to go back and and shake
your head at this
the entire January 6 situation depends
on one assumption
more than one but one that I care about
and the one assumption is what Trump
actually believed
am I right because if Trump believed the
election was genuinely fake
then why he did make sense actually it
would make sense as a candidate and it
would make sense as a patriot it would
make sense as an American
if he genuinely believed the vote was
hanky
now the entire January 6th thing depends
on him
depends on his critics knowing what he
really secretly thought that he has
never said out loud to anybody that we
have any evidence of
so here's Trump the person who says
everything he thinks
am I right
Trump is the person who says everything
he thinks
and yet there's no evidence whatsoever
in writing any reports any not even
Anonymous reports of trump ever being
inconsistent
with his belief that the election was
sketchy
so
why is it that the most unrealistic
assumption is underpinning the entire
thing and we don't pay attention to that
I feel like I'm the only one who's ever
mentioned this
actually ever
have you ever seen anybody else say
everything depends on what he was
thinking
and if you were to make two hypotheses
of what he was thinking
do you think there's really any chance
that you thought the election was
um
Fair
because he was he was thinking the same
thing that most of the Dem most of the
Republicans thought don't you believe
that most Republicans thought it was
sketchy most
I think most did
so if he had the same opinion that's
most Republicans who had the same
information he had we were all just
watching TV right he didn't have like
secret you know secret Intel he was just
watching TV like the rest of us so if he
watched TV and you watched TV and you
said to yourself that doesn't look like
a fair election to me I don't know if
you're right or wrong but say that was
your opinion
why would you think he wouldn't have
that opinion
like what what is what possible argument
could you make
that he would singularly believe the
election was fair when everybody was
looking at exactly the same information
at the same time
all the people on his side said
I'm not so sure if that election was
fair and of course you know doing the
the most obvious analysis you can do
did the Democrats think the election was
fair
did Hillary think the election was fair
when Trump won the first time
no
the most the most
um
common believable and ordinary
assumption you can make about this
situation as well as when Hillary lost
the most common ordinary assumption is
that the people who lost genuinely
believe there's some question about the
outcome
they genuinely believe it now
if I were Trump's team that's the only
thing I would talk about
I say are you making the case that you
believe the president actually thought
he lost when nobody else thought that
now it's separate from the argument of
whether he really lost so you know their
trick is to argue whether or not it's
true
whether or not it's true that the
election was fair
has nothing to do with this
because nobody was operating on the
truth
because it was unknowable there was a
suspicion
but at that time it was pretty hard to
know what was true and what wasn't if
you were biased toward thinking the
election was rigged as the Democrats
were when they lost as Republicans are
when they lost as the Democrats will be
again if they lose you don't think the
Democrats are going to say the election
was rigged if they lose the next
election of course they will
do you think they'll believe it
yes yes I do I do think they'll believe
it
that's how it works
so
now am I Wrong Am I Wrong that
everything follows from that assumption
am I missing anything
the entire understanding of that day
has everything to do with what Trump
secretly actually believed about the
election
because if he believed that that was
rigged and he didn't do a thing
about it I wouldn't vote for him
would you
I mean I don't vote anyway but but
seriously if he believed it it actually
been rigged and he did nothing didn't
complain about it just sort of you know
slunk off to his retirement
he wouldn't be the person you you
thought you voted for the first time if
he did
and I'm not sure you'd want any
president to be like that
I mean I want my president to say what
he believes
and to act on it
and
uh Saturday defense it wouldn't be an
insanity defense because most
Republicans believe there was some
problem with the election
now just to be clear so I don't get
banned I'm not aware of any proof of
election irregularity as scale I'm not
aware of any
but would I be I'm not sure I would be
yeah he told them to go down and
peacefully protest now he did he did of
course want to do wanted Pence to delay
things and there are smart people who
say that wasn't legal and you can't do
that and I guess that's the bipartisan
bill that even
even Schumer is willing to say something
about the
the electoral votes you don't want to
play with them after the election
and that's probably I haven't looked at
it but probably a good idea I mean if
it's bipartisan probably a good idea
all right
um
it was the most perfect election of all
time well I've said many times
that it's a miracle that all 50 of our
election systems work perfectly
we are told
and yet every other organization and
system that we know about is completely
corrupt
which we know and for sure you don't
have to wonder you know we know that now
is the FBI corrupt yeah yeah yeah we
know that
that there's no longer in question
all right
uh
have I complained too many times about
how my critics like to come into my men
into my tweets
and compare me to Garfield and other
comics
and it's usually it looks like this
oh uh the Garfield guy again
or here comes the Beetle Bailey guy to
say something
and it took me a while to figure out
that these were compliments
their attempts their attempts at insults
but you know do you see what they get
wrong it took me a while to notice
why is it that it's an insult to call me
Garfield
what makes that an insult
it makes it an insult because the person
saying it believes that everybody who
sees that understands that Garfield is a
less Good comic than Dilbert
right
Am I Wrong the reason they would call me
these other cartoons the whole point of
it is they believe the other cartoons
are of lesser equality
yeah you know what they don't call me
peanuts
they don't call me um
they don't call me Calvin and Hobbes
although I have seen that but that's
that's rare
do you know why
because my my critics believe that those
two Comics are unambiguously better than
Dilbert so do I I mean I mean most
people would agree with that
so they call me the Lesser comics
because the whole point of it is that
they're not as good as my comic
and every time it happens now I'm
thinking
I feel like you just complimented me
because this wouldn't even make sense
the entire point of the insult is that
that other comic is a lower quality than
than mine
yeah Kathy
Etc now I'm not saying that they're
lower quality I'm saying that that's the
whole point of people saying it is that
they believe they're lower quality so
thank you for the thank you for the
compliments I appreciate it keep them
coming
here are some things that I read about
myself uh in the fall in the past week
so if you wonder Scott
do you ever get much trouble online
do you ever get bothered by things that
people say to you online well not that
much
but uh here's some things I got called
this week uh a holocaust denier
uh and uh
um it is alleged that I believe that
rape is okay because it's natural
that that's actually a widespread
opinion about me on the internet
is a widespread opinion that I believe
that rape's fine it's just natural
somebody actually thinks that was my
opinion or is my opinion
okay
um
fine and people also believe that I'm an
anti-mass Crusader who is secretly
trying to get you to all wear masks
so at the same time that I'm one of the
most notable critics of masks
spend a lot of time notably talking
about not wearing my mask and required
masking places trying to mobilize people
to get rid of their masks and so that
makes me Pro mask if they read my mind
they can see that like on the inside
even though on the outside I'm totally
anti-mask but on the inside they can
they can see
that because of the things I tweet
they can tell
they can tell that because even though I
don't wear a mask because I'm so afraid
that I'm really Pro masked
um so there are books coming out more
books about Trump of course
and uh
they're running out of insults
the every book that comes out about
Trump they've got to have a new you know
thing
but they're running out of the good ones
so here's some new books and it doesn't
matter who who wrote them right it
doesn't matter at this point it wouldn't
matter if it's Maggie Haberman or
somebody else but these are somebody
else
but they're in the news today so one of
the things is that Trump was way more
serious about buying Greenland that you
knew
he was actually really serious about
buying Greenland and he made an argument
that you know it's it's sort of close to
our domain and would be valuable to us
and you know Denmark wasn't using it for
much anyway
but apparently he actually negotiated
with Denmark to some degree
he was actually trying to get it now is
that a criticism
is it a criticism that Trump literally
tried to buy Greenland
that feels like the opposite of a
criticism
don't they have valuable minerals
isn't it geopolitically you know
geostrategically important
ah
I mean
that that should have been framed as a
compliment now the fact that it didn't
happen
is that is that an insult or is that a
criticism no it was a long shot
it was a long shot that cost him nothing
except embarrassment
and he was willing to take the
embarrassment
for the potential of maybe having an
upside that would be amazing
I mean again it looks like a criticism
that's more of a compliment I want the
president who does that all right here's
another one here's another criticism
they have to say I don't know is that
really a criticism
one of the books claims that Trump was
way more serious than you thought about
withdrawing from NATO
is that a criticism
what would be happening in Ukraine right
right now
well I don't know but it wouldn't be
costing us money
um I don't know maybe Ukraine would have
just rolled over and Putin would own
Ukraine and we wouldn't have known the
difference
and we'd be getting our Ukrainian wheat
and Europe would be getting their stuff
and ukrainians uh corrupt government
would be putting out of business and
they would go back to sort of how things
used to be you were you know Russia
dominated that country
now that would be bad for the ukrainians
I mean I guess they would say that I
don't know maybe someone
but can we say that Trump was wrong
about withdrawing from NATO based on
what we know today
it's actually not obvious is it
you could certainly make the case that
it's a good thing we're in NATO it's the
only thing to stop Putin and that would
be a strong argument
but you could also make the case that
maybe none of this would look this way
if he had pulled that in NATO
and and Putin didn't feel threatened the
other possibility is that Putin wouldn't
feel threatened by having NATO on his
doorstep if America was not part of NATO
I mean everything would have looked
different wouldn't it
so I don't know
you know I'm not saying it would have
been a good idea to pull on a NATO
that's not my opinion
but it's not obvious which was the right
right way to go
which is not obvious
now I think that also when he talks
about pulling out of NATO that's that
could have been a negotiating position
as well
so he may have been really serious about
pulling out if the other countries
didn't step up with money
you get that right he could be totally
serious about pulling out if you don't
give us more money but then other
countries gave more money
so I don't know if he still was still as
adamant about pulling out but I think he
was serious if they didn't give more
money which I would have agreed with
actually I think you did have to
threaten to pull out
if they didn't cough up more money I
think that part was right
and then his age worried that he might
try to start a war with Iran or North
Korea because of his crazy ways
neither of those things were even close
he wasn't close to a war with Iran
it wasn't even close I don't think was
he
I didn't say anything that looked even
close it looked like he was just gonna
you know boycott them forever or
whatever
and what about North Korea
North Korea is one of his success
stories
he took the temperature away down in
North Korea I mean what was he going to
do nuke North Korea his friend
so the the books have completely run out
of material
uh
think about his legal troubles
correct me if I'm wrong but not counting
January 6 for which no indictments are
likely to come
say the experts
his biggest legal risk at the moment
correct me if I'm wrong because it might
be what I'm missing
is a civil case
against Trump the company not even
against Trump himself so not Criminal
and not even against Trump am I right
that's his biggest risk right now and
what is what is the power of the case
the entire case let me summarize it
the Trump company handled their
accounting the way all normal companies
do
that's it that's the case they did
things exactly the way normal companies
do
they they took the highest number they
thought they could get away with when
valuing it for loans
and then they got allowed
and then they paid back the loan and
then the bank was happy
but when they were doing their property
tax assessments you want the lowest
number you can get away with there
he went the opposite way
like everybody
like everybody
now he may have exaggerated or the Trump
company may have exaggerated more
than other companies do and that would
be worth discussing
but no matter what it is it's going to
be a civil fine
it's not exactly the crime of the
century to have exaggerated more when
you are the company that exaggerates
more and your entire business model is
built on your brand
right the Trump brand is the value of
the business
and so would you expect somebody whose
entire business model is about telling
people their brand is better than maybe
it is
this is a little business model so if he
did it consistently everywhere he told
everybody that he was better than
better than maybe somebody else thinks
I don't know
it might be a crime
likely you might be able to find a jury
who says yeah that's slightly a crime
that's a little bit more exaggerating
than I think you should have done so
maybe you should pay a fine
that is just business as usual for every
company every big company that gets
audited
do you think they get away from the
audit with nothing
do you think there's nothing just pick a
company just pick any company
pick Google do you think if Google got
audited they'd end up paying nothing
sometimes Maybe
but it's very common
that a you know traditional company gets
audited and pays a little extra money
because they exaggerated something
that's how it happens they exaggerate
stuff
or minimize things
yeah so just just think about the fact
that what the remaining complaints about
Trump
I've all just kind of dissolved so the
January 6th thing has turned into
nothing they're trying to breathe some
life into it with the you know the jaws
of life today I guess so they're trying
to make the nothing into something but
January 6 proved there was nothing
at least nothing of criminal and
dateable quality
now all of his other legal problems have
gone away except that trivial one that
really is nothing
what's left
what's left
anything
so he wasn't colluding with Russia
I mean what's left
the only thing left is how his
performance would be compared to Biden
now of course Democrats look at Biden
and say yeah he's killing it he's doing
great
and Republicans say the opposite
uh
although they have the lady who claimed
that he raped her in a dressing room in
a group in a store
Gene Carroll so I guess she's
doing her lawsuit again but nobody
thinks that's going anywhere right
that isn't that just a he said she said
situation that's the end of it
on Twitter today must said he would
discuss buying into Rumble oh did
that really happen
did that really happen
[Music]
holy what's the price of uh rum
right now
can somebody check the stock price so
rum was 12 yesterday or this morning
oh he was asked to and he declined oh
come on
all right he was asked about it and he
declined
what don't get me all excited about that
now
um you know the reason I'm excited is
because I'm an investor so I invested in
the locals platform
which got combined with Rumble so I
ended up accidentally with some rumble
stock which turned out to be
the the best accidental investment I
ever made
yeah rum is worth a shot nicely done
rum is worth a shot okay
well done
all right
um question
how many of you think that Elon Musk is
secretly bankrolling The Babylon bee
because if you notice that the Babylon
bees uh let's say their budget seems to
be way better than it used to be
the quality of their content and and
also the volume of it is suspiciously
very good
now it's not suspicious that they're
good
because you know they're good
but you know you saw Elon Musk met with
them obviously they got along they have
some kind of connection the founders of
the Babylon Bay now wouldn't that be the
number one most likely thing you would
ever expect
you'd expect him to secretly bankroll it
just because it's funny
if I had his money
nothing would have kept me from giving
some of it to the Babylon B
am I right
assuming that money is No Object which
is a fair assumption money is No Object
and you know he liked them and you know
you know he likes you know he likes
poking the bear
if they didn't get money from him
I would be amazed
I'll be amazed because that they're
they're uh quality of the operation just
went long way up
all right
um
you would like to have a reframe for how
to get women
do you think I can give
this gentleman a reframe that will help
him in his dating success
yes I can
yes I can
you're here's your reframe
you're trying to find a woman uh you're
trying to find the right woman
right and you're not finding right the
right connection stop looking for the
right woman
look for lots of people
you want to increase the number of
people you're exposed to not just
looking for dates just the total number
of people who you were exposed to
and that's how you increase your odds
because well I don't think it's
necessarily true there's somebody for
everybody
it probably isn't
but if your entire universe of people
you're looking to get laid is three
people
your odds are low
if suddenly you increase to 10 people
you have to have sex with a little bit
better but if you're not you know top 20
still low
if you know 100 people well now you're
talking
now you're talking there's somebody
who's going to be looking at you too so
the reframe is it's about numbers it's
not about necessarily just your quality
but
I'm going to make a prediction
whoever is it whoever it is who just
said you know you're having trouble
getting women
I'm going to make a prediction
that when you take your clothes off and
you look in the full-length mirror
you're not delighted
now I don't mean that as an insult just
a purely practical statement of cause
and effect
if you go into the gym
and you have a job
you're going to have some interest from
the other sex
I know it's not fair it's not a fair
world but get your body in shape
all right so here's uh
I might lose my power on the locals feed
because I'm I'm getting a low battery
message
so I can make that stop if I plug you in
instead of
instead of using the microphone I guess
oh
yeah I don't have I don't have the power
for that never mind oh I do hold on
all right locals you can lose the
microphone
but you're going to gain power
all right
so that's the uh
gaining Powers while you're here yeah
yeah it helps to be tall yeah but
I I don't know how many more times I can
give this advice
have you walked down the street lately
and looked at your competition
I mean seriously just go to the mall go
to any any public place and just look
around
see what you're competing with
what would it take to be in the top 10
percent
of fitness
for just the people you see around just
just look around what would it take to
be in the top 10 percent
not much
not much
top 10 percent of fitness
is the most achievable goal in the
United States
I can't even imagine anything easier
than that maybe falling off a bicycle
right maybe jumping in a mud puddle that
would be easier than but being in the
top 10 percent of Fitness just means you
tried
I don't even know if you could fail if
you tried you know I mean if you started
at 400 pounds it's going to take you a
while to get there
but unless you're a grossly you know
you've let things go too far
it's not hard to get back into the top
10 percent and why wouldn't you do that
it's the most controllable thing you can
do so control the hell out of what you
can control
yeah just control control everything you
can control so if you controlled you
know your career stuff by training
making sure you're trained enough you
can have a reasonable job and you can
control your Fitness and your diet
same thing
you're going to be in the top 10 percent
you missed the part about blowing up
pipes you're late
all right so that's my statement
uh
uh am I obsessed with Fitness that's
kind of body shaming too
well I guess you could put a negative
spin on everything but I'm I wouldn't
say I'm obsessed by it
oh yeah I guess I am yeah I'll actually
accept your I'll accept it usually I
don't like that obsessed by because I
had a little judgment in it but I think
I think in this case I am obsessed by it
and I should be
so I would like you to be obsessed by it
as well it's probably the best Obsession
I have
here here's another
hypothesis and reframe for you you ready
you don't have an option of not being
addicted
Let It Go
Let It Go you do not have an option of
not being addicted to something
I don't think
now of course people are different
there's going to be some somebody who's
the exception to everything so I'll give
you that but for the average person
you're going to be addicted to something
it's going to be sex it's going to be
food it's going to be exercise it's
going to be the outdoors it's going to
be your animals it's going to be your
friends something
you're gonna be addicted to something so
instead of saying I'll try to avoid all
addictive things you should go
aggressively at
at trying to make yourself as addicted
as possible
to things that will be good for you
so I'm addicted to exercise
intentionally
I've done everything I could do to make
myself addicted I've given myself treats
I make sure I do things I like I don't
push myself too hard I don't hurt myself
too badly I do everything you could do
to make it a rewarding literally
rewarding I do it at a time of day that
it's going to be the best it recharges
me you know I I track how I feel on days
I exercise versus I don't it's a big
difference that helps me do it I have a
trick for going to the gym when I don't
want to go to the gym I've taught you
this before put on your gym clothes
especially your your Footwear
and just having the right clothes on and
walking around I'm like ah well I might
as well at least go for a short run
you know I got my clothes on right so I
do everything I can do to addict myself
to a positive thing so Obsession
actually is close enough to the right
word
desire and seeking is human trait okay
can I do some push-ups for you
women look at men's shoes now there's a
good tip
whoa David Eagles just paid fifty
dollars to tell me that Narcan vending
machines are being installed in cities
hello here's what I'd like you to do
we're going to go save some lives you
ready
now I said this last night in my man
cave live stream but I'll do it again
for you today
one of the things that this experience
does meaning this live stream that many
of you come to every day is that it's
more than just some content I'm spraying
out
we have formed a an entity accidentally
sort of like an accidental organization
in which we can we have a collaborative
intelligence that can actually solve
some problems
and one of the problems with uh fentanyl
overdoses is bad information
so if you had better information you
would know for example that Narcan is
something you could get at your
drugstore
and if you had it nearby and somebody
was going into overdose situation and
you got there quickly I don't know
exactly how quickly it quickly is but
while they're still alive
and you administer it and I guess you
don't have to be an expert to administer
it it's pretty easy to do
the odds of them living are very good
it's actually very effective
now
the number of people that are watching
this so we've got let's say 3 000 live
here 600 over here probably 40 50 000
people will catch this live stream I'm
going to ask all of you to do the
following thing
research how you could get Narcan in
your state because every every State's
different
in my state you can have the pharmacist
write the prescription
I didn't even know that was a thing
right so uh Carey found that out and has
also spread that news through San Diego
State University
so because of this live stream
one active member uh went and figured
out how you get Narcan in California
just go ask for it and get a
prescription from the prescription from
the pharmacist not a doctor
and then she spread that information
into a a parent group as San Diego State
University
now the parent group was very active and
they were all they were all over it
because there had been a couple of
fentanyl scares just that week
so it was like fresh in the parents mind
oh God the people are dropping like
flies even where my kid goes to school
now they were I believe
some number of them will get
um will get it for their kid to have at
college or something now
there are also some apps
I think uh pulse point is one app that
calls for people who know first aid I
believe
but I think within that umbrella you
could call for people who who if you
sign up for it uh if you had Narcan
I believe you would get notified if
somebody had that app and saw somebody
having an overdose
because they'd be calling for anybody
who had first aid and you'd have that
I believe
so here's what I'm going to ask each of
you to do get educated on on how Narcan
is obtained Where You Are
and then tell your friends if you have a
place to spread the information just
spread the information because I don't
see the government doing this
correct me if I'm wrong Joe Biden should
go on television and say everybody
should get Narcan or have it available
it's different in each state so go
figure it out what it is in your state
and see and just self-organize
so I don't have mine yet but I'll I'll
get mine the way
Carrie suggested I'll go get mine
and then when I have it my my
neighborhood is organized so we have you
know text messaging lists and stuff so
I'll send out a what's that message to
my neighbors and I'll tell them that I
have it so if they if anybody in my
neighborhood has an overdose
there it is and I'm also going to tell
them that if I'm not home
that I can open my garage door with my
app and I'll just tell them where to get
it
so if somebody can get to my house and
five minutes and all of my neighbors can
they can have Narcan in five minutes
and maybe 10 minutes they're back to
administrate if that's in time and I
think I think you do have 10 minutes
does anybody know enough about this to
know
how often do you have enough warning
that you can get to the Narcan do you
know how much time you normally have
there
I mean everything's different right
but you're talking about just a few
minutes
so you need it close
now I believe that if we do what what
some of you will do because I know you
take it seriously some of you will do
this and I think we can save some lives
I believe that this live stream
literally will save lives
and
you know I'm going to act on it I hope
you do too
all right
how do you know if someone is overdosing
on fentanyl I don't know you should
research that as well usually you know
because they've been taking opioids and
somebody usually knows they've been
taking them
and correct me if I'm wrong it's for
opioid overdose not just fentanyl right
can somebody
give me a fact check on that
is the Narcan for yeah it's for so you
don't need to know it's Fentanyl you
need to know that opioids were involved
or failing in that you need to know that
they're a person who might do opioids
and you don't know what else they've
done
so I think you might want to administer
it in some cases if you're not sure
but again I'm not your doctor so don't
believe anything I tell you about that
so that's what you need to look at and
it probably says something on the Box
about when to use it right I would
imagine it comes with instructions
and uh Carrie Chabot is the one you need
to thank for spreading that message
yeah
all right
and then I think there's also something
being contemplated about the Good
Samaritan problem
that you would have legal liability if
you help somebody and things go wrong
no problem giving it to someone who does
not need it we have we have the somebody
who seems to know what they're talking
about
right so you don't need to worry about
if it's the wrong time to give it you
don't need to know if for sure it was
fentanyl it could have been in the
opioid
and if they're still alive
give it to them
right I guess that's the I guess that's
the bottom line
uh
it's not looking good in Florida
so does anybody how many of you are in
Florida
and uh are you looking at a category
five is that what I heard
and you're not leaving
now for category five do you do you do
you stay
do you stay home if it's category five
grab a surfboard yeah
wow
Virginia also has training good
so it'll be a four or five right
so the Santa says to hunker down
uh
basically a CAT5 so you're close to five
what if somebody wants to commit suicide
by a fentanyl
well
I don't know do you really need an
answer for that I mean that's sort of a
depends the situation depends on the
situation but I can't imagine that you
wouldn't try to bring it back
all right
um
you won't get in trouble if you call for
help even if you're on opioids yourself
that's true
that's true yeah if you didn't know that
the uh the Emergency Services they're
not going to arrest you
yeah they're not calling the police
because you have opioids in your system
that's not happening because they know
that that would make everything worse
that's
they're pretty good about that I don't
think you need to worry about that I've
never heard of anybody being in trouble
because the ambulance picked them up
that's not a thing
I wouldn't want to have any on me
but even if you had it on you
I feel like the medical community would
not be turning you over to the police
I don't think so
what do you think I mean there'll always
be an exception but I can't see the
Medics even if they saw some illegal
drugs
I think that they would just sort of you
know leave them in your apartment when
they took you
I just don't think they're taking those
with them
uh
all right
yeah the cops do come but I don't think
the cops are arresting you for having
some possession if you're in the I mean
if you have a user number of pills and
you're having an overdose I don't think
they're arresting you
I don't think so
but I I suppose I could be wrong
don't know everything could be different
all right uh
do what presidents should say Cass you
know I I always find it
obnoxious when people do the uh here's
the letter
that the President should write to make
everything better
and then you read it and you're like ah
no not really that's not really the
letter they should write it just feels
like
telling somebody like Trump what to say
specifically is kind of obnoxious
saying it generally like you know this
would be a good phrase to use then that
makes sense
dear Putin if I were your mother right
Khloe mature said to vote Democrat and
the Hurricanes will disappear did you
see Don Lemon trying to get the NASA guy
to blame climate change for the
hurricane he couldn't get the NASA guy
to to bite any one hurricane could be
attributed to climate change
now he did you know the NASA guy didn't
poo poo climate change
but uh Don Lemon wanted to make it
political and the NASA guy is just like
it's a hurricane
he just wasn't having any of the
politics it was funny oh it was uh it
wasn't NASA it was a national
NOAA
National what
organization of blah blah
uh up
all right well I guess we don't believe
any data anyway
I'm gonna go do something else
and uh
I think we saved some lives today
what do you think
yeah let's go save some lives
and get your uh
get your mug Erica what's the latest bug
count
how many mugs
that's right you probably don't have
that right now I'll follow up with that
later all right that's all for today
yeah it was a lot light news day
it's all you needed today that's all you
needed you didn't need anything else all
right
it's hit on your ex day okay
response to Tim pool and Civil War
um well I don't know that it requires a
response but I guess the question would
be if I thought that Republicans would
be hunted
why would I think there would not be a
civil war
and I just don't think that those two
are very close I think that the way the
Civil War will be is people will vote
right as long as a vote is coming up
you're not going to have a civil war
yeah you might have to worry like if
somebody didn't like the vote if it went
poorly things could get tense
but I don't see any situation
where a civil war happens two years
before an election
in the United States
do you especially when the other team
looks like it's ahead in the polls
nobody's going to start a hot War when
they could wait two years and just vote
in the other guy
or other woman right
and I I think you just have to remind
that remind people of that and they'd be
like okay
yeah so individuals will def and
politicians will hunt Republicans
but that's a long way from the whole
country wants to you know go to war with
each other there's nothing like that
Brewing
foreign
wasn't meant like with a hunting license
and an Elmer fun hat now exactly
what is the diameter of the bottom of
the mug I don't know but it's a 20 ounce
mug
it's similar to the one that you see me
use in the
you know when I do the simultaneous sip
what's that uh you're not telling the
truth and you're saying things that are
killing people
what
what am I saying that's killing people
what
all right
um
if you need a link to the mug see my
Twitter feed this morning it's near the
top
all right
uh that's all for now YouTube I'll talk
to you tomorrow
oh I helped you in your last
relationship with the reframe good bye
for now
