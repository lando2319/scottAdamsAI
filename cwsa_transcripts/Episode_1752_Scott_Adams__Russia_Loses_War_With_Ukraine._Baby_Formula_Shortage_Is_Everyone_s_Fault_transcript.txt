good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
coffee with scott adams the best thing
that's ever happened to anybody anywhere
is true
and if you'd like to
enjoy this in a way that i don't know
you'll probably be telling your
grandkids
all you need is that copper margaret
glass of tanker jealousy style the
canteen jugger flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's a
dope me the other day the thing makes
everything better it's the simultaneous
it goes now go
i have a question on the locals platform
does dopamine help vertigo it helps
everything you'll still be dizzy but
you'll be happier about it
does everybody feel their dopamine just
go up a level
is it just me
it's not just me
no your dopamine just went up a little
bit that little happiness you're feeling
right now
because of the beginning of coffee with
scott adams that's real that's real
you're feeling it
well i told you that there's a do new
star trek
series called star trek discovery
and i watched the first one a few weeks
ago
and i reported that it was not ruined by
wokeness
had not been ruined by wokeness because
the other
most recent star trek had been just
overwoke
to the point where it just ruined the
writing now i'm all for loneness
i'm actually you know
i know you might be surprised but i
think the awokeness stuff is completely
appropriate
but like everything good
you can take it too far
and then it ruins everything
so it's not the goodness of it in
general
i think we should all treat people the
way they would like to be treated
to the extent that's practical
but everything good goes too far i made
a comic strip on that very thing
the dilbert comic doesn't make fun of
bad things
that that's a misconception it doesn't
make fun of things that are bad ideas
it makes fun of good ideas that are
taken too far
mostly i mean i do both
but uh it's a it's an important
distinction
so
um
the new star trek discovery i watched
the second episode and it's ruined by
walkness
it's completely ruined
yeah the the second one was almost
unwatchable
because i thought oh they've got a nice
diverse cast
that's good
star trek always had a diverse cast that
was one of its strengths so we're good
to see that
and i thought okay they're not they're
not trying to kill us with wokeness
they're just doing it the way the
original star trek did
they're just building you know building
the cast up to be you know full
capable people and that's all you need
everybody from different types they're
all full and capable people
but no the entire second episode had to
be about the only black woman who is a
cast member in the on the
on the deck
and uh how awesome she is compared to
everybody else
basically
and i'm thinking
i don't know
i mean
the fact that she was black and female
didn't have to do with anything did it
except they wouldn't have done that
story if she hadn't been
if she had been just a
generic
or let's say i've been a generic white
guy
they wouldn't have done a story about
how smart he was
would they
like it wouldn't make sense as a story
it's just the awokeness of it that
turned it into
a story element it's like hey she's
she's uh black and she's female and she
can speak 37 languages or 39 languages
whatever it was
and
i think it's great that all the
characters you know are celebrated for
their
you know positive traits that's cool
but here's the problem
here's the problem
um
to have a good show you need flaws
do you remember the original star trek
with captain kirk
he was like his strong character but he
had a real flaw and his flaw was his ego
right
which was an awesome flaw
because his ego is what helped him but
it was also his enemy
which was really good writing right a
good set up for good writing but the
current captain is just sort of a woke
guy
there's no complexity there at all
so
i can't recommend the new star trek
discovery it is so far based on the
second episode is ruined by wokeness
but we'll see if the third one gets a
heavy and again i'm all in favor of
wokeness you just don't have to put it
everywhere all the time too much of it
that's all
um jonathan turley continues to be a
national treasure
and partly if you if you're not
following jonathan turley for legal
analysis mostly
he finds little corners of stories
that you haven't seen yet that really do
matter like actually really important
stuff that hasn't been talked about yet
and he's doing it again
uh this one's really clever the way he's
i mean clever in the sense that it's
good that he knows these things and we
don't so he can tell us
so there's this case about steve wynn
who owned the the win hotels
and i think he's out of the business now
i'm not sure what his stake is but
he got me too don't i think
and
he's he's being uh i guess sued by the
government in a civil case about pharah
that
foreign agents registration situation
so if an american citizen lobbies on
behalf of a foreign country
they have to register
as a lobbyist of some sort or else it's
illegal
but
it can be illegal in two different ways
apparently
it could be illegal in a civil way
which means you don't go to jail
somebody says scott is wrong on this one
well i'm gonna you into oblivion
for saying something like that
goodbye
um again for anybody's new i like
criticism
just put the criticism in the comments
scott you forgot to mention
you know you're you're under emphasizing
x
what about why
absolutely love those comments
but
scott you have a bad take today
we don't need you here you're worthless
your friends hate you
anybody who says they love you they're
lying
all right
um so steve when because his case is
being treated as a
civil case instead of a criminal case
jonathan turley cleverly has picked up
on the precedent
because there's somebody else who might
be facing a potential legal problem
based on foreign uh
being active for a foreign government
and that is somebody named hunter biden
and so as jonathan turley argues if i
understand his argument correctly
the
hunter biden defense could say wait a
minute wait a minute
how could you possibly come after us
with a criminal case if such a thing
happened in the future
how could you come after us for a
criminal case
doing exactly the same thing they would
argue
the steve wynn is only being charged
civilly which is a far lesser offense
all right we'll go by friedler you
you're into oblivion too
i think it's just some people
want to get blocked or something
all right um
so i think that's a good point
good point is there something happening
that's intentional
that would that would make hunter biden
get off on a lesser charge if there's
any charge at all and if he's done
anything illegal which
is to be determined
yes could be a precursor to softening
things up for hunter so i love that
there's a jonathan turley who can
um sort of sniff this out before his
news i mean this is really good sniffing
isn't it
he's connected two stories that before
you saw them connected he could see he
could see around the corner this is why
you follow him
you can see around corners
um
eddie also writes about there's a
situation with ben dominosh of the
federalist
who made a joke on twitter about
his own staff unionizing
and he made a joke about you know off to
the salt mines or something if you try
to unionize
now it was in the context of
some other entity unionizing and it was
just a joke
but apparently
it's illegal if you're
in charge of a company
to say something about unionizing that
makes it sound like there's going to be
a penalty for it
because you have the right to unionize
and so somebody who has nothing to do
with the company not an employee just
some liberal troll decides to sue
over a
joke really
so there's somebody on the left
who sued ben dominic over
a twitter joke
that everybody knew was a joke
you couldn't you couldn't miss the fact
that it was a joke it was an obvious
joke
and do you know what the court ruled
uh it was a joke
so i guess the court had enough people
involved who could tell what a joke was
hey this is a joke
it's not a legal problem it's actually
just a joke
and i can't believe that ever went to
went to a court but it did
all right here's an interesting question
how do rights get formed
or do you just have them unless the
government takes them away
in my view of things you have a right to
do everything
until the government takes it away
does anybody would anybody agree with
that
description
now but god-given just means all the
rights i would say the god-given part
could be eliminated from the discussion
because what is it whatever it is we're
starting with we're starting with it
doesn't matter how it got there
so whether it was god-given or not
irrelevant to rights because rights are
human entities basically
so however we got here
would you say that whether god put us
here or not
that the
question of rights is that you have all
the rights
until the government limits them
right
so
then this interesting side question this
is
do you have a right to an abortion
do you have a right
to an abortion and the answer is yes
until the government takes it away
right
yeah you have a right until the
government takes it away that's how it
works
now there are lots of things that the
government takes away
i can't uh drive a car if i'm 14.
right
it would be a right
except the government took it away
so it's the way everything works
but uh george upper at the uppercut
um says this
he says that i'm incorrect in my you
know definition of it right he says you
cannot have a right so he's clear
clarifying a specific case here not a
general case but a specific case he says
you cannot have a right to something
that requires someone else to give
something up
and he says that's why health care isn't
a right in any form
you cannot have a right to something
that requires someone else to give
something up
true or false
you cannot have a right
that requires someone else to give
something up
it's false completely false
it could not be more false
but you're all saying true
every single right gives something up
let's say you have the right
to
take a walk in the park
right you have a right to take a walk in
the park
yeah and you would say there's no law
against it so you have that right
now let's say uh what does that do to my
right to be in the park alone
because there's no law that says i can't
be in the park alone and i want to be
but now i can't
because you exercise your right to walk
in the park at the same time
so my right to be alone
i mean at least my ability to be alone
has gone away
it's not it didn't take away my right
but he took away my ability to be alone
pretty much everything that gives you a
right to do something is limiting
somebody else from doing that thing at
the same time or the same way
pretty much everything
so it's it's indirect
it's indirect somebody says that's thin
i always say it's indirect but it's
always there
everything you do has
some limit on somebody else
um
you want another example give me another
right
what is something else you have a right
to a right to own a gun
let's say
okay you have a right to own a firearm
in the united states
does that take away anybody's right
well it takes away uh my right to not be
around guns
if i wanted that i mean it's not the
right i want but if i wanted
i wouldn't have that option
so i would say maybe it doesn't take
away somebody's right
it takes away their options
in pretty much every case
scott you confuse rights with privileges
now see if that's a good comment
you don't get blocked for that
so
the rest of you who
don't know how to make good comments
learn from that
he says i'm confusing rights with
privileges
now i don't think i am
but that's at least a reasonable comment
i i'm i'm confused i'm conflating it
right
with let's say the physical ability to
do something
because there's no point having a right
to do something you can't do
i have a right to flap my arms and fly
is that useful
go flap your arms and fly you have the
right it doesn't help
so in a practical sense everybody's
rights tend to impinge on other people
you can use different words for it but
everything you do impinges on other
people
all right
otherwise it's just word thinking
um i was watching not all of you watch
basketball so i'll make quick work of
this and it's not about sports
but the warriors beat the mavericks
that's the third third time in a row
and
i like watching
sports because of
persuasion like watching the sort of
mental part of it and i'll tell you
there's one thing that you can see in
the faces of the mavericks
versus the faces of the warriors
if you looked at the faces of the
mavericks they looked like they didn't
think they were going to win now could
just be my bias of course
but they really look like they didn't
think they were going to win
well before the this you know the game
was too far away for them to win
whereas the warriors always looked like
they were going to win
and
some of it has to do with the fact that
steph curry is on one team and not on
the other
and if you've never noticed
steph curry i don't think he's having a
good a year as he's had before
but i'm sure the reason is because he's
bored
if you watch him in the first part of
any game
he misses a lot of shots seems a little
sloppy
and then the last 10 minutes comes which
is the only time that matters
and then he just wins
he just wins it feels like he doesn't
get interested until it's almost too
late
um
he reminds me of uh one of the most
fun i've ever had or the best times i've
ever had watching a youth um soccer game
so it was i think maybe
10 year old boy is playing when my
stepson was was playing on the team
and i was watching and there was one one
kid on one team that was
the team i was rooting for who is sort
of a superstar among the kids
and for some reason their team was
behind
and i mentioned to his dad i said
uh what's going on here
you know nick's team is behind how's
that happening
he goes i don't know he yells out to his
son he goes nick do you know what the
score is
and nick looks over and he just nods
and there's like three minutes left
i'm i'm exaggerating we're just a few
minutes left and then nick scores i know
three or four uh goals solo
and wins the game
it was just the funniest thing nick do
you know what the score is he just nods
he scores three goals and wins
it was the most awesome thing you've
ever seen in a in a kid's soccer
context but anyway that feels like what
stephen curry does he just waits till
the end they're like okay now it's time
to wake up
but i'd like to say something about the
coach
so steve kerr has coached the same
same group of people mostly
largely the same to several
championships and you would be
presumably i guess considered one of the
greatest coaches
because he's done so well but it's hard
to
it's hard to
it's hard to know how much is that he
just has better players
right does he just have better players
but there's something he does that i
don't see other coaches do
and maybe if you watch more sports than
i do you can tell me how common this is
he doesn't get mad at his own players
for even really really dumb mistakes
have you ever noticed that
is there anybody else who watches them
he is completely poker faced when he one
of his
players just passes it to the wrong guy
i mean just really dumb stuff
nothing
not a single reaction
and but when one of his players gets a
bad call
like he's all over it supporting him
so he does take people out
you know he replaces them if they're not
performing but it's very just matter of
fact
you're out you're in
and
i have to wonder how important that is
because he does sort of what it looks
like the dale carnegie approach where
he's only telling him what they're doing
right
that's what it looks like
it looks like he only tells them what
they're doing right
now he must be telling them what they're
doing wrong sometimes whether where the
other coaches do or you know doing the
day-to-day drills and stuff
but it looks like
he's operating on a pretty high level i
think
was it coach jackson
who coached
michael jordan etc phil jackson wasn't a
phil jackson who had that same
approach right he basically never got
mad at his players during the game not
even a little
in fact he didn't even look bothered
and let me tell you the the
uh
the psychology of it actually let me
tell you a story from my own my own past
as you know
i'm
a hypnotist as well as sometimes i used
to play tennis so i used to be my game i
used to play tennis a lot actually and
when i was young i lived in a place that
had some tennis courts in the apartment
complex and they would have some they
would have tennis
tournaments for the people who lived in
the apartments
and i joined the tournament one time and
it was they would pair you with somebody
who would be your partner
and i got paired with a woman to be my
tennis partner who had never played
tennis
that's right
i was in a tennis tournament
and i got paired with somebody who
didn't even know how you keep score i'd
never touched a tennis racket
now i said to myself it looks like i'm
going to lose this tournament
because i'm playing with somebody who's
never touched a tennis racket
but
i don't like to lose
i don't know if i've ever mentioned that
i like to lose i don't like it at all
so i set about the task of what would it
take to win
if you have a player who's never touched
the tennis ball
and
what i did have going for me is that she
was a college athlete
so i guess she was a college basketball
player
which means
she's coachable
and almost instantly
have you ever ever dealt with somebody
who's instantly coachable it's really
rare you can say
hold the racket like this
and then they go like that and they hold
the racket and then you go
oh
okay i guess i'm done with that you just
did that exactly like i said and then
you check back in an hour and they're
still holding it correctly
very rare
very rare almost nobody can do that but
she could
so i you know i got a racket held i got
her i got her basics down
in just a few minutes
and then and then i said all right
here's the deal
you're going to play the net
like all the time
you'll just play the net and all you
have to do is if this ball comes over
and just slap it down
and she had good hand eye contour
coordination
and so
uh whichever way we started we instantly
switched i and i was fast so i could
cover the entire back court easily so
even if she missed one i could get it
behind her because i was fast enough and
she was tall enough
and coordinated enough that she could
slap the ball down from the net
i think we got all the way to the finals
i believe we lost in the finals
but
uh the technique that i used with her
was the steve kerr technique
she would do something that was just
you know a mistake
and instead of uh
saying that's okay
which is don't do that if you're if
you're on if you're a tennis player and
your partner makes a mistake
don't say that's okay
don't do that
also
don't act like it's a mistake
do you know what the right thing to do
is
act like you're getting ready for the
next point
that's it that's the only thing
just act like you're getting ready for
the next point don't don't acknowledge
it and she was an athlete so when she
screwed up she would look to me and
apologize
and i would just i just wouldn't have it
i wouldn't have it i just wouldn't
acknowledge the apology because we're
going to win the next point
so i kept her mind on the next point
i got next point next point
and because she was a an athlete she
rose to the challenge and we got all the
way to the finals now i think that
that's something that steve kerr
is doing too and it's one of those
valuable lesson kind of things i like to
i like to reinforce
if you just tell people what they're
doing right and let them work out the
mistake part on their own you get really
good results
my current music instructor who's
teaching me drums
uses the same technique
i'll be drumming and i'll realize that
i've completely messed up a phil you
know i've i came in on the wrong beat
just completely destroyed it
and i'll look at him like he's going to
tell me i did that wrong
but he knows he knows that i know i did
it wrong
there's nothing to say
he just lets it go like it didn't even
happen
i'm like oh
i just made a mistake
but nothing happened to me
there was no repercussion
so now it's easy to make another mistake
and now it's easy to practice it's easy
to stay loose i don't worry about it
there's no nothing coming back at me and
i just loosen up and i play well
it's an amazing technique the the
positive reinforcement
having said that steve kerr also wears a
face mask during his coaching while the
entire stadium and all the players do
not
except for some of his coaches
and then he takes it down when he's
talking to people up close
so he is a lefty
he is a
in general
but apparently he's a good coach so i
won't take that away from him
how about this baby formula story
so there's a new effort that seems to be
totally successful
to launder the
democrat
complete incompetence on the baby
formula
issue
to
to launder that and turn it into a
republican problem and it worked it
worked
so nancy pelosi comes up with this or at
least she promotes
this fake legislation
that would give 28 million dollars to
solve the baby formula problem
except that
it wouldn't make any difference like
it's money that isn't uh well conceived
or would not be well spent it's not
really on point for the problem
but does the public know that
the public doesn't know that the bill is
so poor that no self-respecting
legislators should vote for it
they don't know that they only know that
something that looks like it was going
to help got voted down by republicans
and so
there needs to be a term for fake
legislation
because this is how many times have we
seen fake legislation in the past year
fake legislation
is something that's meant to sound good
but is bad
so that the other team will have to turn
it down and they'll be turning down
something that sounds good
and that's what happened
so the so pelosi successfully it
actually worked
she laundered the biden administration's
incompetence
through this fake legislation
that republicans voted against and now
it's a republican failure
because they voted against a fake
legislation
yeah
fake a slation
we need a name like fake slation
not bad
but uh how many times have we seen the
same trick
didn't they just do this for abortion
i think didn't schumer just do it for
abortion they're trying to get everybody
on record they say
anyway um i'm going to say pelosi gets
the persuasion win
for a clever weasel play
and
i'm sure the republicans do this too
you know i'm not saying that this is
just a democrat trick
but it's pretty weasley the fake
legislation trick
um
all right and now
cnn is trying to
save the biden administration from
the inflation
monster
or at least in terms of save them in
terms of how the public thinks about it
now
let me ask you a question
how many of you think that biden and his
actions
are responsible for
the big part or a lot of the inflation
go how many how many would say the biden
administration
is guilty of making decisions that
increased inflation
not surprised that my audience is mostly
yes
i'm seeing a smattering of a few no's
but mostly yes
all right now stop stop answering this
question for a moment
and now without looking it up
without looking it up you have to answer
the second question
what is the and you could be approximate
but what is the approximate
inflation rate in the united kingdom
so the uk
today
so so you got apples and apples you're
comparing the united kingdom's inflation
today to the united states
without looking it up what is it
i'm seeing numbers all over the place
i haven't seen the right number oh there
it is somebody got the right number okay
some of you actually know it's about
nine percent
about nine percent
u.s is about 8.5
so if it's biden's fault
and the uk has a
conservative prime minister doing
different stuff
why is it that the uk's inflation rate
is the same as the united states
basically
somebody says not comparable
pick another country
how about france
was the inflation rate in france i
didn't look this one up did somebody
know
what's the inflation rate in france
i don't know
so if you think that you know why
inflation is worse here
i don't
i don't
i've got a degree in economics and i
don't know why it's what it is
because i don't understand why the uk is
the same inflation rate
is it just some weird coincidence that
it's all different variables but it came
out about the same
it could be
could be totally
so
the first question you've got to ask
yourself is why are we not seeing
comparable um comparisons more often
because i would think both the left and
the right would want to make those
comparisons
somebody says it's all due to the same
green energy policies is it
in the uk
i don't know
i don't know about that
so i'll just put that out there as uh
we all have this intuition
that biden caused inflation go higher
and i share that
i share that intuition
but i don't see numbers to support it
so i'd have to see some numbers
to believe it but my intuition leans
that way
um so be a little bit more i think be a
little bit more guarded on your opinion
about inflation i think there's just too
much fog of war stuff going on there
uh then john harwood
cnn one of their main propagandists
uh opinion people
um
he says that indeed he says economists
across the political spectrum
now believe that biden's
1.9 trillion american rescue plan
uh was had some good parts but did
accelerate inflation
and he said
that republicans have a point
so this is someone writing for cnn who
says republicans have a point
that the economists agree that biden
drove up inflation
he says what's unclear is how much of a
difference the rescue plan made
normally
i would be criticizing that statement
for propaganda
because he's sort of minimizing his
what's unclear is how much of a
difference the rescue plan made
but when i look at the uk's numbers i
have to agree with him
i'm not inclined to agree with that
but i have to
right i mean i don't want to
i don't want to agree with that at all
i feel like it's something i should
disagree with
but the numbers support the fact that
you can't tell how much of it was
any one cause
um
and then he's he's arguing that the
reason the inflation hasn't affected
affected us much yet
is that it get the the thing that caused
it
or caused part of it some say
the rescue plan gave people money and
then the lockdowns caused them to save
money on
you know i guess entertainment and other
stuff
and so
americans had some excess savings
i get i don't know if the definition of
excess savings is but more than usual i
guess
and unemployment looks good so he's
arguing that
yeah inflation's up a little bit but
people also got some free money because
of the thing that caused inflation and
so you know push-pull
not that big a deal
he would say
what do you think of that
do you think that
do you think that the softening of the
inflation scare story
is valid
because if it's true that the other
countries that are
comparable-ish
have similar freight inflation problems
it's probably not
because of management decisions is it
cutting oil production oh okay so some
are saying that u.s cutting oil
production affects everybody
uk
how much how much energy was the uk
getting and
would there would their prices really be
affected by the u.s cutting production
probably would i mean indirectly would
of course
but how much
it's more of a how much question isn't
it
yeah
yeah any change in supply and demand
should change all oil place prices
conceptually
but did the uk have something like a uh
the american rescue plan did the uk do
something like that
all right well i guess my only point is
that uh
math proves anything
all right
um
if i were the democrats
and i cared about
persuasion
every time somebody mentioned inflation
i would mention the uk
because don't republicans say hey that
boris johnson reminds me of trump
right
so if i were trying to be a persuader on
the democrat side and i wanted inflation
not to be such a big thing every single
time it got mentioned i'd say you know
it's about the same as the uk
now even if the reasons are not the same
it's good persuasion because the people
we don't know
if you just tell me we have the same
inflation as the uk
i say oh
well i guess it doesn't matter what you
do
right because
they didn't do exactly what we did
and
and we're not saying that they did
something wrong necessarily are we
scott why are you ignoring canada
why does everybody ignore canada sorry
sorry sorry
sorry
no i don't mean to insult canada why am
i ignoring canada what is the inflation
rate in canada
that might be the question you're asking
inflation rate in canada anybody
6.5
6.8
so 6.8 compared to 8.5
i don't know if that tells us anything
to me those are the same i mean i would
round 6.8 to 8.5
i
i don't think
you know that sounds about yeah it's a
25 difference but on a small number
all right
i need more infor info world yeah okay
um
i will reiterate this question
why are we not hearing more about the
supply chain
why is the supply chain story so opaque
and why are we not panicked about it
what's going on
there's either a gigantic supply chain
problem
or there's not
the only thing i can figure out is that
the supply chain has figure it has
figured out the 80 20 rule correctly
in other words
if they knew they could only get 20
percent of their things delivered on
time
could it be that the supply chains have
figured out
how to get the important 20
shipped
and the other 80 like waiting for
furniture so for example i ordered some
furniture
that i won't get until july
i don't know if this has anything to do
with the supply chain problems it could
be normal
but i don't really care
right if i have to wait till july to get
a chair
i mean
i'm not going to sit on the floor i'll
probably sit in a different chair but if
i if i were missing my microchips for
whatever if i couldn't buy an ipad or a
phone i'd be in serious prob you know
it'd be trouble
so i feel as if the supply chain just
adjusted
the 80 20 so that we're getting the 20
that really is critical
the 80 that isn't we're waiting for it
but it doesn't matter
is that what's happening
is it just massive micro adjustments
everywhere
baby formula is not a supply chain
problem that's just a u.s
poorly managed problem
uh
supply chain expert john monroe has a
podcast but what's the bottom line
but what is the bottom line we must have
made massive adjustments
because
everything we've heard suggests that the
economy should already be destroyed
if anything we were told was true about
the supply chains you know that the
massive number of ships that can't be
unloaded and all that if any of that's
true
the economy is already destroyed and we
haven't noticed or something
but i don't think it is true
i think somehow the adam's law of
slow-moving disasters
worked fast enough
that we got past the hardest off right
because the story we're not hearing is
oh we're right on the
we're right on the teetering tipping
point
for one thing or another
and i don't because i don't think we are
yeah the baby formula was a special case
that didn't really have anything to do
with display
supply chain problems per se
container shortage is that a thing
might be
all right um
here's the news
in on
cnn this is what they chose to cover
from the ukraine war that there was one
russian tank commander
who's been prosecuted by the ukrainians
for war crimes
killed the civilians
and i ask you this
what does it mean when there's a story
about one soldier
jailed for war crimes in the context of
a major war
in which
lots of civilians got killed
i feel as if this is just propaganda
right it's it's propaganda it's a show
trial it's propaganda
but
isn't it interesting that that's
basically the only news on the war
the only news on the war was one russian
guy got
is going to be jailed for life for a war
crime
that's it
like it's a major war and that's that's
the only thing cnn wants to talk about
about this major war one guy
well
i'm going to make a declaration today
provocatively
that the war is over
and ukraine won
and russia lost
so i'm going to call it
because who gets to decide when a war is
over
right i don't think there's going to be
a
any kind of a
meeting
i don't think russia is going to sign a
document that says the war is over
so it's not going to be over over
like the way some wars are where there's
a document and a signing and all that
that's not gonna happen
so who gets to decide if the war is over
i think it's the observers
the observers the people who write
history
the pundits
basically
and since i
you know i live in that world at the
moment punditry
i declare that the war is over and
russia lost
that's my opinion
and i'm going to say it publicly the war
is over
russia lost
now let me give you the counter opinion
which is worthy of consideration
mike cernovich saw my opinion on twitter
and said i sense the opposite
ukraine lost in the real world millions
of most talented left as regime was
corrupt land taken cities in rubble
and russia lost in the fake world
mystique uh they didn't take keys in 72
hours and the question is which matters
most long term
good question
because what does it mean to win a war
it's not so clear is it
what does winning look like
well it depends on what you think they
were trying to achieve
so
one argument is that they both lost
ukraine lost
talent and cities and and treasure and
people and they look and and territory
they lost a lot
what did russia lose they lost their
their mystique about their military
their reputation their economy will take
a hit
uh and
they look weak
and probably it's going to be tough to
build up their military again without as
much money
so i will acknowledge that that point is
a strong counterpoint however
wars are
have winners and losers
history is going to decide somebody
wanted somebody lost
and
i'd like to get ahead of that and say
russia lost
so here's here's my argument my argument
is that i don't think there's any
question
that putin wanted to control all of
ukraine
now i don't i don't know what he said i
don't know if he was willing to settle
for less maybe he was willing to settle
for the territory they had more
strategic value etc but in my opinion
having watched
everything we've watched
having watched the way they attacked
ukraine
you know and sure i get that maybe the
attacks in the north were to pin down
the ukraine army
and give them more leverage in in the
areas that they cared about i get that
it could be just a military strategy and
an obvious one
um
but it looks to me based on what
um
putin has been saying about ukraine
forever
to me it looks like he was trying to
take the whole country
let me ask you how many of you believe
that putin's
objective was the entire country of
ukraine how many how many think so
mostly knows
wow
interesting
all right you're surprising me
a lot of no's
okay well i didn't see that coming
surprised
now why do you think
do you think that he had a strategy of
getting what he could get
but he at least one of the
the places that are strategic
because here's the thing i don't think
he's going to be able to hold the
strategic places
if you said he captured them and now
he's going to control them forever i'd
say oh okay that's a good argument that
he won
something pretty important
but i don't think he can hold them
do you
because why would ukraine stop pounding
him ukraine's just gonna turn that
territory into like a killing field
aren't they
so i don't know what winning looks like
in that context
winning is no nato but nato grew
i don't know i would say russia lost the
war
because they didn't get control of
ukraine they lost the they lost the
narrative war they lost the economic war
they lost the reducing nato's influence
war
i feel like they lost everything
now ukraine lost a ton and we don't know
if they'll be able to build back better
so to speak
and yeah the the ruble
was stronger than we thought but that's
more of a non-issue at the moment
uh
all right
so
that's what i say ukraine one more
there's a uh interesting take by uh
michael mina you might know him from uh
he was he was the main person arguing
for rapid testing during the pandemic
uh i tried to boost that signal as much
as possible but ultimately
the government beca i think because our
government is corrupt
i think that's the only explanation
we're not fast enough with rapid tests
to make a difference during the pandemic
and as michael mena points out that
maybe part of the problem and i would
agree with this completely is that we
we manage the pandemic with a medical
mindset
instead of an engineering mindset
and
i didn't see his entire interview but i
think it means the stuff like this
a medical opinion would be don't use
rapid tests because they're not accurate
enough
and that was that was the guidance that
kept us from having rapid tests
don't use them because they're not
accurate enough
that's a medical
standard medical opinion don't use a
test that's inaccurate
the engineering opinion was
engineering opinion it's just based on
math
if you could do enough of these less
accurate tests you would come out ahead
so if you could do them often you would
catch so much of the virus at its worst
infectious points because remember the
stuff it misses
are the infections that aren't very
spready
the reason it would miss an infection in
other words give you a a negative when
there was a positive the only reason you
would miss it is because there's very
little virus
but if it caught all the people who had
really spready virus
how would that not make a difference i
mean it's just an engineering approach
so i think he's totally right i think
that the the medical first
approach was completely a disaster
i would also extend that to the drinking
bleach hoax
how do you get how do you get that
drinking bleach hoax well
when trump was
speculating about can you do something
to insert
a disinfectant into the lungs
he was talking about light
he he started the conversation telling
you it was about light and then he was
done he brought it back to light so he
knew he was always talking about light
as the disinfectant
that's sort of an engineering
is sort of an engineering approach to a
medical problem
because the engineering is how do you
get that thing down there
right we already knew that uv light
could kill virus and maybe not damage
people
you still needed to test it but that was
sort of an engineering thing
and then as soon as the medical people
heard it
they turned it into a medical thing and
then it didn't make sense anymore and
then they said oh
president doesn't make sense
now the president was talking in a
engineering sense correctly he was
correctly
bringing up a topic in the correct way
but the medical people we don't
understand that doesn't make sense from
a medical perspective
because it was an engineering thing
um yeah his word choice was
suboptimal
no way for russia to win at this point
well one assumes that russia will keep
pecking away at ukraine forever right
so they will use other tricks they'll
use bribery and espionage and
hacking and whatever else they can
so i don't think russia will ever be
done with ukraine
but i don't see that they're going to
conquer and hold ukraine as a country
that looks like that's done i believe
that question is asked and answered
and i don't even know what you i don't
even know what fighting is going on
do you
what what actual fighting happened in
ukraine today i didn't see any reporting
on it at all is there any there has to
be right probably locked
no reporting
all right
i need to follow defense politics asia
tweet it at me awful
um
there's no reporting yet you believe
them when
you they say we won um
here's what i believe
i believe that the russian army is
stalled and ukraine still stands does
anybody does anybody disagree with those
two statements
ukraine is still a country and the
russian army is stalled
and it doesn't it's not obvious that
that's going to change i don't see any
reason it would change somebody's
disagree with that
which which part do you disagree that
ukraine still exists or that the russian
army is stalled
somebody says they're back on the move
okay we'll watch for that
so you're saying that the news is just
ignoring a major russian advance
because the news usually reports that
the ukrainians have beaten back the
advance
i never believe that
i never believe that you've beaten back
the advanced stories
all right all right well we'll see
i'm going to stand with my prediction or
statement that the war is over and
russia lost
um and if you stick with yours
you should expect that russia would
do some major offensive and and take a
big chunk out of ukraine
five cities are under siege
interestingly the news seems very silent
on that those five cities under siege
those are all in the disputed territory
right so i'm not i'm not questioning
whatsoever that russia got some extra
territory and and the territory that
they wanted the most
that does seem to seem like it happened
pseudo bill okay
all right
there will be a treaty and new borders
ukraine says no
ukraine says there will be no
land negotiating now of course that's
what you say before you negotiate
but i feel like they mean it
i feel like ukraine is not going to stop
fighting
because they can just put their
artillery
just sit there and just shell the
russians forever can't they
um
with 40 billion behind them yeah
well
let's all stay away from the monkey pox
and all right that's all for now
um
ooh abbott is behind two of those things
abbott center of rapid test and abbott
center of baby formula is 25 of the
supply shortage
huh
biden's remarks on china and taiwan
i saw a headline
that biden basically said we'd go to war
if china attacked taiwan is that what
happened
or he
suggested it i'm not sure that's news
they're walking back already yeah i just
don't know that that's news
statement the state department walked it
back of course
yeah i don't think it matters what we
say about it because when if and when it
happens
we're going to make the decision from
that point
the thing we're not going to do
is go there because we promised
if anybody thinks that matters
i don't think it does
so it's not going to matter what we
promised to taiwan it doesn't matter
what we said before
if if the goes down
we're going to make a decision like
we've never thought about it before
it's going to be a you know start from
zero decision all right
now we're in this situation what do you
do now it's not going to be based on
what we said we do
none of that would matter
all right
uh russia is winning bigly you say
there's an antifa shooting in colorado
haven't heard about that
uh
oh bill morrow went based on the trans
question
yeah i'm starting to get tired of uh
bill maher's stories
every friday he says something that's
you know anti-his own team he says
anti-republican more
but um
anyway i'm getting tired of that story
because it's like the same story every
week
the sussman trial
i
i'm just
my mind is boggled by the whole sussman
hillary clinton
collusion hoax thing because we've now
proven that everything that we suspected
about it was true right
like everything you thought about it was
true
and
they've they meaning the democrats have
taken so long to deal with it that we
don't care anymore like it doesn't have
the same
salience to us we just waited too long
and it's complicated and it's over and
trump's not the president so it doesn't
matter
so you can make anything be the the
biggest problem in the world or the
smallest problem in the world just by
how you treat it
oh yeah the operation fly formula
oh my god
so the binding administration names
their
their airlift of the baby formula since
they're going to fly it
they call it operation fly formula
now
fly formula sounds like something that
jeff goldberg should stay away from
you catch my drift
stay away from the fly formula because
it'll turn you into a giant fly
who came up with that name a fly formula
no
get fly completely out of your name
because i don't think of airplane
you know what they could have been
project baby formula air lift
huh
baby formula air lift okay
how about formula by air
how about
baby rescue
i believe i could go all day long and
never say anything as bad as fly formula
am i right nothing is worse than that
fly formula
basically equating children to flies
uh it's all part of the biden war on
babies
the bio or
the biden administration hates babies so
much they equate them with flies they
abort them
they don't give them enough formula
and uh
they let them grow up in a
world with
all kinds of
inflation
so the biden war on babies continues
all right
operation nipple nectar
okay
not bad
all right
that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow i'm sure
the news will be fascinating tomorrow
and this is the best live stream you've
ever seen in your life i know best show
ever
and i'll talk to you tomorrow
