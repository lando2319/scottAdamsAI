well we're back hello youtube and hello
locals
i'm not seeing uh comments on locals
is locals down
let me make sure i've got something
going on here we're going to talk about
the verdict
huh
well i'm going to have to
change my screen orientation to get to
the bottom of this there we go
a little technical problem all right
how many of you have heard the verdict
kyle rittenhouse
not guilty on all charges
not guilty on all charges
i've got a few things to say about that
number one
as i've been telling you
the entire american system
and because of america's reach much of
the world
our
our ability to get along with each other
and make money and defend ourselves and
just about everything else
depends on one thing more than any other
thing
trial by a jury of your peers
if you lose that
you lose everything
right because all your credibility is
gone
you just can't do anything
and i've said for a while now that the
jury system is the crown jewel of the
republic you get that right
and you can
you can maybe you know put up with a lot
of imperfection elsewhere because you
can work out that in perfection over
time
but if you lose the
the jury by
you know your peers
if that becomes corrupted
you've lost everything
so
um today was
way bigger
than kyle rittenhouse
i'm going to tie a few things together
that i've been talking about
one is a lot of you have been feeling a
weird energy haven't you
an energy in in the world a pent-up
there's some kind of pent-up energy and
not just you know from the shutdowns
might be part of it you know the travel
restrictions or whatever
but there was something else
there's something big
brewing
now i don't know about you
but i could feel all that energy in me
like it needed to go somewhere and i
couldn't exercise it off
couldn't sleep it off
i just couldn't work it off
and when i heard the written house
verdict
that was it
but it's not about him
it's it's not about rittenhouse
i mean it is a little bit
but the bigger issue is
that the system worked
and
this is way bigger than you think not
just because the republic is solid
because it is
but i never thought that energy
was conflict energy did you
there's something else going on here
it's the absence of conflict energy
and yet gigantic energy
so when people said to be scott you're
trying to you know rile up a civil war
i immediately said no no like i'm not
feeling that
not even a little bit
like i think we've been we're miles away
from anything like that
what i think
is that that energy was
positive
don't know where it comes from maybe
it's just you know
cyclical or something like that
but
here's the implica the implications of
the ridden house trial
this is the day
that msnbc viewers
found reality
do you feel it
that's like the biggest thing that's
been keeping the country apart
is that
we couldn't convince we being everybody
who doesn't watch msnbc
we couldn't convince them that their
news was made up
but this will
do you know why this is special
this is special because msnbc
hosts and their viewers
have spent uh how long now telling us
that
the election had to be fair
why
why was it that the election had to be
fair and we know it for sure
what what did everybody who watches
msnbc say
they said the courts decided
and in those cases i believe there were
no juries am i right
those were always judge decisions
i'm not positive about that but it's
always a judge
but
and i think most people left and right
would agree with the following statement
a court decision with a jury is going to
be more credible than a judge
because if it's a judge you say oh is
that a republican or a democrat
appointed judge right
automatically
but if it's a jury
well then you're thinking
you know maybe that's pretty good
so
the the far left has hypnotized
themselves into believing that if the
court says it's true it's true
and now the court in the ridden house
case even more credible because 12
people agreed
and and it does look like they did a
good job by the way
i would like to thank the jurors
as we all should
we should thank them for tremendous
sacrifice personal risk
definitely personal risk
reaching the right decision and being
patriots
i think in the end whatever problems
they had
and we don't know the nature of it yet
i don't know if there are some people
who legitimately thought he was guilty
or not so we'll wait to find that out
maybe it was people legitimately afraid
but whichever it was
whether it was people legitimately
afraid to make a decision because of
their ramifications
or legitimately thought
in their best thinking that he was
guilty
it looks like everybody involved
voted for the system
you know what i mean
like if you're the hold down juror
and you realize that you know 11 people
are on the other side
at some point you have to say
is this about the case you know let's
say that you legitimately have a
different opinion
at some point you say is this about the
case
or is this about the system
because you can get a case wrong and
it's tragic i mean if somebody is
wrongly convicted or even wrongly gets
off it's tragic either way
but you can survive that
you know why you can't survive
breaking the system
so every time a jury that's
10 to 2
comes out with a unanimous
um ruling
i say to myself there's a bunch of
people
who put the system first
as they should have
as they should have now they don't have
to do that every time
sometimes the system is the problem you
know if somebody's uh on trial for a
bogus
law
and you say yeah they did violate that
law but it was bogus do you know what
the jury can do
break the system
they get to break the system just say
all right we're just going to say he's
innocent because you and your laws
you know that's a dumb law we're just
gonna ignore it he's innocent
[Music]
so
here i believe
is um something that's gonna cause
either massive cognitive dissonance and
probably a lot of it
um or but also massive enlightenment
at some point the people on the far left
are going to have to ask themselves why
this thing called the court system in
its most credible
form meaning that the jurors really
worked on this and the public got to
watch it it was all transparent i liked
that part
and
through a completely credible system
they learned that their news
was fake
and that their president
had accused
a young man of being a white supremacist
with no evidence to support that
now is it over
tell me if you think that
kyle rittenhouse has a legal case
against the people let's say the tv
hosts at least
i don't know how it works with
politicians they have some kind of
immunity right
but i don't know what the some of some
of you have to tell me what the
political immunity is
but
if you're a tv host or a pundit or just
anybody a public figure
and you called a person a white
supremacist on a news channel
that's important right
because the context of being on a news
channel
and nobody corrects you or nobody pushes
back on it
that turns into news
whether you like it or not i mean
it's one thing to have an opinion
that disagrees with the news but if
you're on the news channel
the news itself has to say what the
actual news is
or else you've presented the opinion as
the news by default because you haven't
you haven't
said it's wrong
so
what is happening to the brains if
everybody who thought he was a white
supremacist and was chasing people down
and shooting them and came there to do
that
when we learned that a hundred percent
of it is false
now
oh my god
a hundred dollars is
as a
as a tip here is uh way too generous and
i i would discourage the rest of you
from
uh making large
comments like that but i do appreciate
it so
so i guess i'm of two minds i love it
because it just means that you enjoyed
the content but i don't i don't
encourage it
but thank you
um
now keep in mind the context of this
the context of this is number one
the entire world seeing very clearly
that biden is worse
than trump in terms of performance
you know i think even the people on the
left are saying you know
at least that border was better or you
know a few things like that i don't
think they've quite come over to that
opinion
but at least it's
it's a it's worthy of consideration
if you're on the left of the right
you have to ask yourself why biden has
such a low rating
you know it's the lowest rating
i'll bet they're the lowest rated
president plus vice president of all
time
let can somebody do some math for me
i need you to do some math on the fly
here for me i know that a lot of
engineers watch this
so you'll need to do a quick search and
then some math
is it true that if you added together
the popularity of biden plus congress
so let's say biden 36 ish
congress
17
are the two of them together still less
than trump's current popularity
after losing the election
am i right
do the math for me
yeah it's about the same right
uh you know i haven't looked at those
numbers recently
but just but just think about that
think about being on the left and you
control congress and you control the
presidency
and the the popularity of the two of
them together
added together
is less than or equal to the thing the
guy you think was the biggest monster
trump
now
uh i'd like to say if any especially if
anybody's
new to me on livestream
i'm not
i'm not sure trump should be the next
president
and
i said the same thing when he ran the
first time
because of age
you know i think we need to have an age
cut off for president i mean i think
it's really important now that said
trump is
he looks like he's you know 20 years
younger i don't know how he does it you
know he does he does seem to have the
energy
um i've detected you know no difference
in his brain in the last several years
so you know you could certainly make an
argument for him and if he ends up you
know running against somebody weak of
course i would support him
but
think about this
think about the fact
that of all the re republicans in the
world who are not trump
and of all the democrats in the world
nobody could come up with a candidate
more popular than trump
that's true right
that we couldn't fight we scoured the
country
and we couldn't find anybody more
popular than trump
now desantis has a strong game and if he
got the nomination
i'm sure i would support him
because i i just like what he brings now
remember i've i've said a number of
times
that there's no such thing as the a good
president
which seems weird
but democrat or republican there's no
such thing as a good president the only
thing there is is a lucky coincidence
that the person who has the job has the
right skills for the specific set of
challenges which are always
unpredictable
right
so trump was sort of the perfect border
president
although i wish he'd you know framed it
better
desantis could probably handle that
um and you know and maybe uh maybe we
needed a little bit of biden
to add a little kindness into the system
one way or another yeah
um so i i do like
sort of the
i like the wavy nature of our leadership
and i think some other people like it
too
but pretty weird that we waited all this
time and we and there's no obvious
person who's even close right
that you forget it's easier to forget
how much wattage
trump puts out
that everybody else disappears when you
hold him in your mind
am i right
republican or democrat
pick the most exciting other candidate
do it do a split screen in your mind one
is trump and one is anybody just any
other person
right unless you picked alex jones as
the other person
you know just for the for the wattage of
it
oh you know what you know who could come
close
yeah tucker i don't think tucker has any
political ambitions
uh joe rogan yeah
that would be interesting
i can't imagine joe rogan running for
president but uh you're right he does
have the
he would he would bring the wattage
that's true
that is true but you notice that all the
people that you can think of
are not running right
like every time you think of somebody
hey how about this they're not running
right
so
trump is the only one who's a legitimate
candidate
i mean trey gowdy would be really
interesting but it doesn't sound like
he's interested
he may not want to get vetted because
it's pretty brutal
all right so uh back to uh trey gowdy
i'm sorry back to uh kyle
um i felt this giant pressure release
because if you think it feels like
things have been pushing in one
direction forever
and it feels like it just stopped
and it feels like the people on the left
probably are learning from something
from this because it comes so soon after
learning that the russia collusion thing
was made up
right
if it hadn't come right so soon after
learning that one of their most
fundamental things they believed was
false
maybe you wouldn't have the same power
but also as i told you earlier
it used to be when i would say that the
find people hoax was a hoax
i would get streams of comments from
people saying hoax i saw it myself
i watched it with my own eyes and heard
it with my own ears
and then it takes a while to tell people
to look at the transcript and they can
see that they've been hoaxed because if
you see the full transcript
you see that trump clarifies exactly
that he's not talking about the people
that
they say he's talked about and he wasn't
even prompted to do it it was just the
next thing he said they just edit that
part out
and it looks like he's saying the
opposite of what he clearly said
so
once once both the left and the right
have seen several examples of
what i like to call a rupaur video
a video where you edit out a piece of it
and it reverses its meaning
once you've seen that that's a real
thing
and it's easy to do
and it happens a lot
then you start distrusting everything
and then the kyle written house thing
was based on video right
what should have been a more conclusive
situation than the entire thing caught
on video
and yet it went to a
trial that had a four day deliberation
so i'm pretty sure that even people on
the left have figured it down by now
that you can't trust video you can't
trust the the memes put out by the right
because the other the right
quite uh
let's say quite strategically
decided that they would just start
making up memes
because nobody could tell the difference
so
i mean i think the left and right have
both seen that videos can be faked just
by an easy edit
or even slowing down the speed you know
the number of ways to do it
uh what happened to my hands i punched
something that um needed punching
which was very painful so luckily i draw
with my left hand so
sometimes you have to punch things
but this was my very point remember i
was telling you that there was some kind
of wild energy that was built up inside
me and i was wondering if other people
were feeling it
punching something didn't make any
difference
like usually it does it was a consumer
product not a person
i i punched a product
uh i i thought that my punch would go
clean through it
uh but i didn't count on what was on the
other side of it
so yeah
kind of stupid
i paid for it
and damn it hurt i gotta tell you this
really hurt
um
but that's not what we're talking about
it wasn't a printer no you don't need to
know the rest it's not important
um all right so that's my thesis
my thesis is that there is a shift in
reality
or how we r how it's being uh perceived
i think also that the left can see that
they are just making up stuff
and that they're hallucinating white
supremacists everywhere
i think the next stage might be kyle
doing lawsuits
and if he wins any or even if they're
just in the news
it's going to change the people on the
left their opinion
somewhat i mean
people don't change change but this is a
lot of evidence
suggesting that they've been duped in
their new sources and i don't know that
that can be kept from them even if they
just keep watching msnbc
i think the the news that they've been
duped badly
has to you know seep into their bubble
from
everywhere at this point
i was getting nervous of any guilty
verdict because of how angry i would be
somebody said
oh and now people are saying they should
sue kyle
in a uh
i was wondering if that was gonna happen
but can he counter sue
can't kyle counter sue and say hey
you're you're blaming me of murder and
i'm not a murderer
i i think that the uh
the collective consciousness is changing
yes that is exactly what i'm saying the
zeitgeist if you will
um i was reading saw another article i
think it was on no i guess it was on fox
fox website
about a feminist who's uh
who thinks all the trans stuff is
terrible for women and so she's
basically saying let's put the brakes on
the wokeness coming from feminists
and you know bill maher criticizing his
own party because he says they have a
crazy wing now
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
happening and the only reason this this
sort of correction is happening
i hate to say it
but it might be because trump's out of
office
and they got to see
it's the case of the dog chasing the car
be sorry what you catch you know be
sorry
what's the is there's a chinese proverb
about
be sorry what you asked for
so
um
oh what about uh bill maher's stance on
the january 6
yeah i i think he
hasn't seen the full news on that that's
that's my guess
because i don't know that he would have
a different opinion than anybody who had
seen the full news
anyway the democrats got what they
wanted control of congress and they got
their president um
what
somebody says my twitter posts are
deleted
that can't be true is it
uh victor davis hanson agrees with your
assessment
canceling trump was the biggest mistake
the left ever made right
right
uh trump for all of his benefits um was
very expensive
you know what i
uh mean
i always said he's just an expensive
president
but if the things he can do are uniquely
things he can do then you get what you
paid for
that was always my take i never said he
walked on water i just said he was
expensive but you get what you paid for
you don't blow up the system for free
yeah
i was a nervous wreck when they were
reading
oh my god is is that true on the
on locals i'm saying they're posting a
picture
it looks like a screenshot from msnbc
that couldn't be from today
that they're focusing on the victims
today
are you kidding
no my printer is fine by the way my my
new hp printer is a it's a beast
it's uh it's done everything i've asked
of it
all right well then let me ask you uh
a closing question here
um
all right i'll tell you what i punched
do you really need to know that badly
all right i'll tell you what i punched
so my cat eats the it's a these treats
called little friskies
and it comes in a plastic container
about ea big
and when you open the plastic container
there's a
sort of a plastic cover
that must be removed
now
i have
a pet peeve
and it goes like this
if i have to get a tool
to use your product that i just bought
off a store shelf
if i have to get a tool
even if that tool is just scissors
or anything if i can't open this with my
bare hands
i go a little batshit
because i think to myself
who tested this
did anybody see how angry the consumer
would be if they had to go find a tool
to open their product
and so i said to myself well i'll just
use my thumbs but man this was a really
good top
it was really on there
and i pressed and i pressed and
nothing happened in fact it started to
hurt my thumbs
now i was not only offended
psychologically by the fact that they
would give me this product that couldn't
be opened without a tool but now i was
in pain
hurt my thumbs pressed too hard nothing
happened
so i said to myself well it's about this
big
about this big around
my fist is going to fit through there
pretty easily
so i gave it a good bam as hard as i
could
didn't even
slightly damage it
and i thought
really
because you know i hadn't yet damaged my
hand but i thought i really punched the
 out of that thing because i was
pretty mad
but now i was really mad
because i had punched it and nothing
happened
and so i leaned back and i just punched
it as hard as i could
because i didn't care what happened at
that point i didn't care if there were
little friskies everywhere
i was going to open that without a tool
so i punched the jesus out of it
didn't even slightly
change its uh
adhesion to this to the rest of the
container
well guess how mad i was now
because by now
my fist hurt
my thumbs hurt and my brain hurt
and i was going to get those little
friskies out of there
without
turning around and getting the scissors
that were two steps away
no no no
those scissors were going to remain
right where they were
and i was going to open this with my
bare hands
and so it was time to go all
hulk
must crush on them
and so i said to myself
i'm either going to break my hand or i'm
going to open this packaging
and so i punched it with the kind of
force
that would guarantee that if it didn't
open i would break my hand
and it opened
now i was not so accurate and i hit the
hard plastic shell on the way through
and that's where i badly injured my hand
and bled all over my kitchen or over my
bathroom actually
so there was a lot of blood
but
do you know what i did
i opened it without a tool
and i call that
winning
so today's all about winning people kyle
rittenhouse he's a winner you're a
winner because we have a jury system
that works
and that little frisky
container well it doesn't know about
prison or island
you've heard of prisoner island well now
my little friskies has heard about it
and i must go and do something else now
you're all champions you're all
champions
bye for now
