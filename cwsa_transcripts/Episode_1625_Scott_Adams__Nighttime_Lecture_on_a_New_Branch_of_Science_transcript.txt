well welcome ladies and gentlemen
uh tonight is a very special lecture
on a new extension really of science
itself
now i know it's been confusing these
last
few years
and a lot of you have started to
question science
do not question science
i'm here to repair any damage that has
been done to science
with a simple extension that i think
you'll find
quite pleasing
now
i might not be
a trained
scientist
but
does a trained scientist have a
double-sided white board
okay they might have one of those
but
does a trained scientist
have a live stream okay they might have
a live stream and a double whiteboard
and they might be trained
but
are they here now
possibly but if you don't know where
they are
stick around because i'm going to teach
you
how to improve on science now really
this is now something that i invented i
don't want to take credit for it
some people are calling me the father of
this new
science the inventor of it
i like to think of myself as a a
co-inventor
more of a on the team sort of a person
you know i have some patents
not this but
so without further ado um let's start
with a a background
all right before we get to the new stuff
it's good to get a grounding
so you're familiar with the
traditional model of science
which
uh let's for our purposes i'm going to
call the old testament
by analogy
so you may be aware that you start with
a hypothesis
then you test it
and ideally you would run your test
results and your write-up through a
peer-review system
in a perfect world people would also
retest it to make sure that the test can
be reproduced
if you've got something that's
reproducible and it can pass the peer
review system and eventually the test of
time it becomes what they call
a theory a theory
now people
theory is not used in the scientific
context
the way the unwashed like you use it
the people who really really are
in the know
the people who would know what
schadenfreude meant without having to
look it up
that sort of people they would know that
in this context theory
doesn't mean you think it's true
it means it's been so thoroughly tested
that it's just
it's a fact for all practical purposes
oh yes
the fact could later be revised
but in the scientific context it's a
fact
now once you have this fact that's gone
through a rigorous process to find out
what is true
then the next step is to communicate it
to make it useful
because what good is a fact
if only a few people know it you need to
get the fact out and so the fact will
run through a filter called journalism
and then the journalism will interact
with another filter called the
government and between those two filters
the
theory
which some would call
a fact
will be
turned into and some would say
transmogrified
into complete
now the complete would then be
fed to idiots
the idiots would reward the bullshitters
forming what we call in science a fusion
reaction
that's endless
now this is what i call the old
testament
and i don't know if you've heard of the
the bible
it's a big book it's everywhere
and the bible had something called the
old
testament and i think you'd agree
you know and an update was
sort of called for
and the new testament
really added a lot
to the bible
say the people who have read it
i've heard about it but
that's what i hear
now similar concept for science now
again this is not something i invented
this is yeah at most
don't call me the inventor of it
or the co-inventor
i was on the team that's all
all right you can call me the inventor
of it
stop it
um
i'm starting to blush
but this is what uh is called the new
testament and this this extends science
in the same way that the new testament
extended the old testament and really
made it useful
that this is that was the part that was
missing from science until recently
now a lot of this is courtesy of
really you could say
maybe the
founder of the field if you will
his name was
trump donald trump
and in many ways he was considered like
the the einstein of
this branch of science
some would say
co-inventor
possibly just on the team
but here it starts where the old
testament left off
a heaping pile of that had been
created by processing something through
journalism and then government and then
supercharging you through idiots in a
fusion reaction
so you take the government and
then you put it through a filter which
is
assume everybody is a lying piece of
and then
assume that whatever they told you
is the opposite
the opposite
right
very it's very simple filter
what did they tell you
assume it's the opposite
now this is called a transformation
and that would transform your
your giant pile of
into something close to the truth
now
i'm not going to say it works every time
it's more of an 80 percent thing
so if you're wondering why
there's so much division
in the world
why can't we agree on simple scientific
things it's because some people are
still stuck in the
old testament of science
and some people have come to the future
and
learned how to transform
 into truth
doesn't work every time
you know it's like prayer
if prayer worked every time
well that would ruin the whole system
because you wouldn't need any faith you
just like pray up some money you know
that sort of thing so you want a good
system that doesn't work every time
because that's what makes it sticky
now
um i don't know if uh all of you have
been exposed to this new branch of
science but uh
if you haven't i think this was probably
uh enlightening
would that be the right word
enlightening
i think it would be and
can we now understand why the new branch
of science which operates almost
entirely on anecdotes
has a higher hit rate
than the one that
we call the old testament of science
i think we do know why
so
that is my lecture for today
and
i'm pretty sure that this will um
i don't want to say nobel prize
that's no stop it
stop it stop it
all right
i mean i suppose if they offered it to
me
i'd go and pick it up but it wouldn't be
for me
it would be for us
it would be for us
it wouldn't be about me
deserve it obviously but it was still it
would be about us it would not be about
me
so
you're welcome and that is all i had to
offer for tonight if i had more i'd give
it to you
but it's just about all i got
and i will see you
in the morning
