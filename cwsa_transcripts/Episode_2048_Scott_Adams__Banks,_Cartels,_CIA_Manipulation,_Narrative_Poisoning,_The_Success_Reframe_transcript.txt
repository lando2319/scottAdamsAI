uh
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened to
you I call it the highlight of
civilization because it is it's just
better than anything you were doing
anyway
so if you'd like to take this experience
up to levels that I don't know nobody's
ever seen before
well all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of technical Stein a canteen
Jokers Alaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine to tell you the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip but it
happens now go
save it save it
well
let's talk about all the stories
would you like to talk about banking
sorry I just I nodded off there
you know I was a banker for a number of
years I started my career as a banker
thought I'd be a big old Banker guy so I
know a little bit about banking
a little bit so let's talk about
Silicon Valley Bank so here's something
I know that people just figured out
I'm not the one person who knew it you
knew it too
but here it is
when the idea of banks you know was
created
and then it evolved into you know modern
banking it was a good design
and one of the things that was good
about it is that even if there was
something that looked like a banking
weakness
communication among people was so slow
that unless you saw a line forming in
front of the bank you couldn't tell
there was a bank run
so you wouldn't know to get into in on
it because you wouldn't even know what
was happening
so Bank runs were naturally let's say
prevented just by poor communication
suddenly you've got Twitter and the
internet
suddenly not only can you instantly tell
people there might be a problem
everybody knows at the same time that's
a big problem but it's worse they don't
even have to go stand in line they just
pull out their app and say Boop all my
money move it somewhere else Boop
so when you have those two things that
went from sort of a little bit difficult
to do find out what's happening with
your bank number one and two actually go
stand in a long line to get your money
out
there was a natural slowdown so we now
have a banking system that was created
for slow communication and inefficient
withdrawals
and then those two things changed
that's a big problem so I would say that
social media
and banking apps that are just more
efficient are actually the risk of the
system
you know almost as much as bad decisions
and you know poor risk management
the the fact that that we have two
mismatched systems our communication
system
is mismatched with our banking system
that has to get fixed I don't know
exactly what the fix is but there has to
be something that's like
maybe I hate to say government
regulation but banks are heavily
regulated for a reason there's a reason
to regulate it right that that's the one
place you really want some regulation in
my opinion yeah if you're going to have
if you're going to get rid of all
regulation and get rid of banking last
you want to keep that one around not not
too much regulation but you want
something
so what would we do maybe some kind of a
government break
where
the brakes just gone now there's an
analogy to this whole banking problem
that I've been thinking about have you
ever thought about how unfair it is that
if somebody knows to form a let's say
LLC limited liability Corporation or a
corporation which takes a lawyer you
have to need a lawyer to do that if
somebody does that little bit of
paperwork they protect themselves
individually from all kinds of legal
risks
and you know bankruptcy and stuff but if
you don't do that paperwork you don't
have those protections
does that sound like a good system to
you
if you happen to know to do it you're
protected
just from some paperwork
and if you didn't know to do it you
wouldn't be protected
that's a terrible system here's a better
system
if you're a business you have all the
protections of a corporation
how about that
what's wrong with that if you if you're
in business you get all the protections
of a corporation you don't have to do
the paperwork
I don't see any problem with that
right and how about this for banks oh
taking taking that concept
How about if you're a depositor the
government protects you
how about that
well I don't I don't think they're
having limits
is I've seen some really bad takes
and it goes like this if you don't have
uh if you don't have a 250 000 limit
that's really a strict limit and you
really stick to it and you never change
it it will incentivize bad behavior
so let's take this example with Silicon
Valley Bank
all right let's say the Silicon Valley
Bankers who made the mistakes let's say
that they were aware there was a good
chance that even the 250 would be
guaranteed beyond that if something went
wrong so under those conditions if those
leaders and especially the risk
management person
so with the risk management person say
to myself to themselves well I thought I
was evaluating the risk properly
but you know
all those depositors would be protected
huh so I guess I don't have that much
risk the only risk would be let's see I
would lose all of my money
I would lose my reputation forever
uh it would be dangerous to go outside
if I ran into a depositor
and everything that I care about my life
would be destroyed
I'm gonna do it because the depositors
are protected Maybe
that's the actual thinking I actually
saw
like an actual adult
say that the executives would be
disincentivized
um
by what happens with the depositors as
if they would not be disincentivized by
losing all of their own money
you don't think that's enough you don't
think that the risk of losing everything
that's what happened to the executives
I mean they made some money before they
lost their jobs but do you think anybody
in the real world who's an executive is
thinking to themselves well yes this
will definitely destroy my life but what
I really care about is that 250 000
limit and I think the government will
protect a little bit more because I did
that one time so I'm going to change
everything I'm doing because the
depositors not about my entire life
being on the line
it's insane it's just crazy no no
changing the amount that's protected for
depositors will make no difference to to
anybody's decision making because they
don't give a the whole problem is
that the executives didn't care about
the the depositors am I right the entire
problem is that the executives were not
working for the benefit of the
depositors they never would they never
will it's not the real world people just
don't care they care about their own
situation and that's not going to change
and and to watch actual adults
in the real world in 2023 get up there
and imagine that those Executives would
have acted differently
if the 250 had been a bigger number
come on
that's crazy
am I wrong
does anybody disagree I don't believe
there's anybody disagreeing I don't see
any disagreement in the comments that I
usually do right that that's how poorly
managed we are or that's how that's how
that's how capable our leaders are
there were real leaders arguing that
point and still are still are that's
still being that's still a point that's
being made by
supposedly serious adults
how can he possibly believe that crazy
all right
um
the other thing we learned about Silicon
Valley Bank is that the speed of mass
hysterias in general you know I'll call
it bank run a Mass list area because
you're causing the problem by thinking
is a problem it's a little different
than a mass hysteria but you can see the
parallels
um so now anything that could have been
a mass hysteria before it becomes one
almost instantly because of the speed of
communication
so that's a problem
right I'm gonna talk about some other
perceptual problems
and then it'll be a theme by the time
I'm done so put a pin in that
um Zuckerberg at Facebook he's cutting
uh 11 000 I guess eleven thousand people
got caught in November another 10 000
being cut
um do you say to yourself uh oh how
could Facebook possibly continue as a
company if they get rid of one out of
four employees which is what it will be
when they do this latest round they will
lost one out of four employees
do you know what the experts say
you're not going to notice the
difference
because the the tech companies that were
wildly profitable
they end up doing a lot of let's say
optional stuff
a lot of optional stuff you know a lot
of people working on you know the next
big thing that doesn't work out and
somebody else is also working on the
next big thing so it's a whole bunch of
people who are working on stuff that's
not the core business
because they can make an argument for it
and because the budget allowed it
so here's my parallel to that my first
uh Dilbert experience kind of when I
when I left the phone company I'm sorry
when I left the bank and went to the
phone company local phone company it
wasn't long after the divestiture from
where all the phone companies were owned
by ATT
so once the individual phone companies
were created they got some allocation of
capital from what I've been the master
entity that was very profitable
so it turns out that the company I
worked for had big piles of money coming
in
just because of the divestiture and had
nothing to do with their business there
was just vast piles of capital that we
had to employ
how many of the things that we spent
that money on were necessary do you
think
because we realized early on that
whatever we established as our budget
for the group I was working in it
probably would be sort of the good
starting point so after that Capital
started trickling out because it
wouldn't last forever
we'd have a large budget and then we'd
be able to say hey we better keep having
this large budget you might have to cut
some other things but look at all these
things we're doing
so people were fighting to spend the
most budget
because that was their best interest
I'm not making that up we had
conversations about how to overspend
and like move some expenses into the
current year to make sure that our
expenses were as high as possible
that was a real thing that happened
real thing
now do you think that a bank like
Silicon Valley Bank which at one point
looked pretty profitable do you think
that all the things they were doing were
like right on target to their basic now
and they were doing lots of social
things and donating money to politics
and all that stuff Facebook I assume
it's the same thing if you got rid of 25
of the workforce no problem how about
Twitter
what percentage of Twitter did Elon Musk
fire
I don't know the numbers like half or
something
does anybody have that percentage I'm
not sure I've seen it exactly
a little technical problem here
oh no technical problem on locals
looks like locals is down I'm gonna
reboot locals
see if that works
well we should
should be one click and back in business
back in business sorry about the
technical problem there all right so he
says 50 percent
50 at Twitter and has anybody noticed
that Twitter is worse
now there have been there have been a
few like technological problems but I
think there always were oh is it 75 did
he get rid of 75 percent
my personal subjective experience is
that Twitter is better
I feel it's better
it's got a little more features
I don't know to me it looks better
um
and that is not unusual from the Dilbert
perspective but uh I think they're
hiding the bigger story here
's the bigger story on Facebook
do you know anybody under the age of 18
who uses Facebook
I don't
no nobody now they do use you know
subsets of the corporation they use
Instagram
for sure and they you know might be
using Whatsapp
but actual Facebook
I I think the real story here is that
Facebook has no no potential for the
future unless they become an entirely
different company which to Zuckerberg
Zuckerberg's credit is exactly what he's
trying to do
he is a good manager I gotta say
you know say what you will about him for
any political stuff or any other
problems you have but he has proven to
be a durable and reliable
leader who has a good vision of the
future so I I think he can own that I
appreciate him for that
and you stayed out of trouble too have
you noticed how much trouble Zuckerberg
stays out of he's really really good at
staying out of trouble
you know you don't notice it because you
don't notice the trouble he didn't cause
but he's just really good at not causing
any controversies
yeah however I think the problem is that
if he doesn't make Meadow work
Facebook has no future
when all the tech companies
got dumped during the beginning of the
pandemic and I bought in because I
thought oh this is the best price I'll
ever get turns out Amazon is lower than
that Amazon is lower than before the
pandemic at the moment so that didn't
work out the other one's dead
but the one that I I wouldn't even touch
was Facebook like I never was even
tempted to own Facebook because some of
the best advice I got early on
was don't
you know don't get too interested in
anything the kids don't want to use
because the timer is on it's it can't
last
all right
um
this is just a story about me this is
just about me so if you'll indulge me
it's sort of a
I don't know signed other times sort of
thing but there's some Gentleman on
Twitter who was really really mad at me
today
but I can't get interested enough to
find out why
but he's really really mad
and he's he's talking about how uh
people who follow me on Twitter are
doing things and that's my fault
I guess people who follow him on Twitter
follow me on Twitter
are doing something to him and he
doesn't like it so somehow that's my
fault but I don't even know who he is
now the only thing I know is he may be
in the media and may have said something
about me but I wasn't reading any of
those stories
like I don't know what he said
but
he reminded me because I said you know
can you leave me out of this I don't
even know who you are he was all mad at
me for the things I've done to him I
literally didn't even know who he was
that's like a typical day for me so I
asked him on Twitter you know hey you
know I don't even know what this story
is about can he lead me out of it
so he tweets that I had once retweeted a
deep fake that involved him
and so that was that was on me because I
had retweeted a deep fake that I guess
in his mind was not complimentary or
something
but when I did when I retweeted it I
labeled it in the retweet
right above it in clear language there's
the AI version
like I'm calling it out as a defect
and he got mad at me
for doing that because I guess more
people saw it but I called it down as
not real I mean I couldn't have been
more clear it was one census and it just
said that it's the AI version
so
I guess I could have been more clear but
he is hella mad I just think it's funny
that he's so mad at me and I don't even
know why
and I'm not and I'm not incentivized to
find out it just doesn't matter
all right there was a Russian jet
that uh messed with one of our Predator
no what what kind of drones a Reaper
drone I guess so did you know that the
United States was flying Reaper Jones
over the Black Sea
well why were we doing that
why
I feel like that's direct American
involvement in a war zone
I realize I'm supposed to be on the
American side here and I am
but why do we do that and why do we
think we can get away with that
flying American even even though it's a
drone it's unmanned but it's a major
it's a major military asset and we're
just flying it around Russia's
neighborhood now I get that it wasn't in
their territorial Zone but it is a hot
War it's a hot War if you fly your
military Assets in and around a hot War
somebody's going to mess with it
so
I don't know I think that's just two
countries
bumping chests I didn't see much there
for a story you see neither side once
wants it to escalate so it won't you
would need at least one side to be
willing to escalate and neither side
wants to escalate and then some direct
confrontation so I don't even have a
problem with Russia knocking that drone
down I guess I had some technique where
they tried to fly their Jets over it and
dump their fuel on it I'd never heard of
that
is that something they invented on the
spot or is that an actual thing dumping
your fuel on the on the Drone but I
guess that didn't work then somehow they
actually clipped the
the propeller or something they clip
something and it went down but did they
intentionally do you think they
intentionally put their Jets so close to
it that it clipped it
and it hurt the Drone more than it hurt
the jet
you say yes
I can't imagine being brave enough
to knock down a drone with my plane
and hoped that I would get back okay and
that doesn't sound right to me
it sounds like maybe they were getting
close to do to do something else and
maybe hit it accidentally
I don't know
or maybe the Drone maybe the Drone
closed the Gap and it wasn't the jet
it's possible the Drone went after the
jet
which would be dumb
but maybe they may have may have thought
well let's just bump this chat and see
what happens
I don't know
none of it I think will become anything
big
um
you see the New York Times was talking
about how DeSantis
is now uh saying he's not crazy about
defending Ukraine and then it's a
territorial dispute now this would put
DeSantis in the same uh
the same bucket As Trump trump was
already there being not crazy about this
war
and as the New York Times but it would
if you put the support of trump plus
DeSantis together 75 percent of
Republicans at least the leaders of 75
of Republicans given that you know
people like different leaders
out of Ukraine
75 but here's what's missing in the
conversation
I don't think Trump or DeSantis can
describe what it looks like if we leave
and without that it's not a real opinion
it's just it's just a political opinion
sounds good sounds good to the base
but what would it look like
how in the world
would you not expect the Ukrainian
people to be crushed by Russia
you got to be able to say that out loud
see if you can't say that out loud you
don't belong in the conversation
I like the Willie Brown
statement on that
yeah if you're not willing to say we
should get out of there and I fully
understand that Ukraine and the
Ukrainian people will be crushed by this
and I fully understand that it would
look like America is backing away from a
fight and I fully understand that it
could uh embolden Russia but we don't
know
we don't know but it could embolden them
that would be a greater risk and it
might give them a recovery time to get
their energy dominance back over Europe
because you because you can imagine the
Europeans would start signing deals
again
am I wrong
yeah they would just start signing deals
again as soon as the war was over so
we'd have to understand that getting out
of Ukraine means giving everything back
crushing Ukraine having wasted our money
wasted a reputation wasted all those
lives
now it still might be the best idea
if it sounded like I said to you so
don't do it I didn't say that
because I don't know what the best ideas
but I know that I don't want to follow a
leader who can't describe it
just describe your plan
here's my plan we pull out in six months
Russia will definitely wipe out Ukraine
you know they'll fight boldly but lose
in the long run then the ukrainians will
maybe be starved like the Hall of DeMar
um and certainly the older leaders will
be executed that we've we've had over
here and you know we're pretty happy
with zelinski but you'd obviously be
tortured and executed and just describe
it
now if you can say that directly to the
American people and then say
and we should still do it
we should still do it because the
alternative is even worse
that's somebody I would believe
that's somebody I could follow
that would be a real leader
tell us the truth
and I can handle the hard truth
I can handle that I can't I can't handle
half a truth I can't handle an obvious
lie but if the San Francisco Trump could
give us the actual truth here's what it
looks like and it's really really gonna
suck for these people but we need to do
it
I'll listen to that I'm not I'm not
pre-convinced but I'm going to listen to
that but I'm not going to listen to oh
we shouldn't be there oh we shouldn't be
there is just
that's for
public consumption that has nothing to
do with policy that's just for do you
think do you think that if DeSantis
became president tomorrow he could
actually pull the trigger and start
pulling people out no it would take
about a minute and a half for the you
know the
what he called the military-industrial
complex to own him
take about a minute and then he'd be
like oh well we definitely want to phase
out but not so quickly you know we have
to do it right so it might take two
years which coincidentally is exactly
the amount of time the war would have
taken on its own
so I think it would instantly turn into
we got to do what we're already doing
because it's too late to turn back
I think that's the truth I think it's
too late to turn back might be
but we'll see yeah
uh once again I'd like to give a public
congratulations to Gavin Newsom for one
of the one of the best political plays
of the year I've told you before that he
uh instead of saying no to reparations
uh well actually this is more the San
Francisco board but the San Francisco
board came up with the recommendations
so here's what they came up with
huh
I was going to try to read it without
laughing but I don't know that I could
do that
so the reason is brilliant is that when
you ask the people who were in favor of
reparations to come back with a detailed
plan you can know in advance that the
detail plan will just be laughable
like actually just laughable and then
you don't have to be the person who's
against reparations you're the person
who tried to get a committee to come up
with a plan
well it's not your fault if the
committee came up with a laughable plan
that nobody would possibly Implement
that's not your fault so Gavin Newsom
for the win here's the plan that the
committee came up with the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors met Tuesday
this is from Fox News site
in official discussions on the
reparations with five million dollar
payments on the table for every eligible
black adult in the city
oh no I'm not done I'm not done
the board expressed quote unanimous
support for reparations during the
meeting even after Stanford University
Hoover institution calculated that the
proposal would cost non-black families
in the city at least six hundred
thousand dollars each
members of the San Francisco board also
expressed interest in other forms of
reparations because that's not enough
for the city's roughly 50 000 black
residents including a guaranteed annual
income of ninety seven thousand dollars
a year for 250 years
for 250 years each person
well what is the average life lifespan
of a black resident of San Francisco
I know they must they I think they live
longer there probably to a thousand
but anyway ninety seven thousand dollars
for 250 years and wait hold on and a
home that they would purchase for one
dollars for a family
one dollar so they want one dollar home
purchases
now since the person selling the home
obviously has to be compensated you
would have to add the you know roughly
I don't know what's a home in San
Francisco million dollars two million
dollars so you'd have to add a million
dollars to each black families say so
the six hundred thousand dollars per
non-black
a resident that they have to pay you
have to jack that up in other you know
maybe a hundred thousand to buy all the
homes but also to pay the uh the annual
9700 000 for 250 years well probably
each non-black resident
um
maybe a million dollars
maybe a million dollars per non-black
resident as their fee to pay for the
fact that none of them have anything to
do with uh
with slavery
all right well
um I'd like to double down on something
that got me in trouble and say that uh
as I tweeted I don't want to spend time
near any cluster of white people who
have been poisoned by wokeness
narratives
is that racist
is it racist to say I don't want to be
near any
cluster of white people
who are who have the that mindset
now I don't think I would have been
canceled for saying that would I
no super racist super racist but it does
not include conservatives
like white conservatives great and by
the way
uh black conservatives love them
you know I don't even know if I've ever
seen a black conservative who wasn't
doing well
have you
is it my imagination or is it every time
I have any encounter with a black
conservative young younger older
they seem to have done okay
like they have you know jobs and
families usually and like all the things
you'd imagine you know signify some kind
of personal success
so
um
I think when I got in trouble
my hyperbole
disguised the fact that I was talking
about a mindset not anything genetic
was there any of you who misunderstood
my comments about the context of staying
away from I won't say it again out loud
but people who have a mindset that
you're the problem
why would you want to be around people
whose mindset is you're the problem
did anybody figure out when I said hey
black Americans are being poisoned
largely by white people to believe that
white people are the problem
why would you want to be around that
literally nobody disagreed with the idea
it's just that it's racist so I'll say
the same thing about white people
white people who are in a Democrat
cluster
I'm sure there are some of them that are
just great
even I'm sure there's some progressives
who are actually just great people have
a little bit different opinion
I don't mind them
of course and of course I'd judge
everybody individually because you have
to it's the only smart thing to do judge
people individually and when I say judge
people individually that's not a race
frame
have I ever explained that when I say
I'm adamant about every individual must
be treated as an individual not a race
not a religion that's based on math
that's not based on any racial anything
that that's a personal success
math-based strategy the more people you
have access to
the more successful you will be
it's called networking those are the
people who offer you jobs so
it's about mindset and it's not about
race it never was about race
it was never about race but the my
hyperbole quite intentionally made it
look that way all right
uh
RFK Jr was on the video recently I was
listening to him and he reminds us
that before Obama's presidency it was
illegal for the CIA
to manipulate the minds of Americans
they could do it in other countries
but it was illegal for them to try to
brainwash Americans Obama changed that
and made it legal again to brainwash
Americans
so do you think that he made it legal
just in case anybody ever wanted to
or do you think that the CIA immediately
said whoa we better immediately start a
department to manage the uh the opinions
of Americans
well
if you've learned nothing from what I've
taught you about the Dilbert kind of
organizations the moment it was legal
you should assume that somebody at the
CIA said you know what if you were to
give me a promotion and a budget I could
run the department
that is in charge of this and we won't
go wild we'll only use it when it's
necessary for you know Public Safety for
example maybe we'll stop a bank run
how about that maybe we'll stop a bank
run that would be good I wouldn't mind
that would you mind if you found out
later that the CIA had had
managed somehow managed our minds
to uh
to stop a bankrupt
some say they would mind unless I
respect that opinion yeah some will say
they mind
others would say you know what under
that specific situation I'd rather they
stepped in and I think both could be
supported I I think smart people could
be on both sides of that question
but
does it make you wonder
now let me ask you this do you think the
CIA uh totally said this isn't our thing
or do you think the CIA said oh this is
exactly our thing we got to stop this
Bank Run
and if the if the CIA wanted to stop a
bankrupt how would they do it
well what would be the tools they would
employ
well what they would use is people
people who were willing to do what they
asked them to do
so they would go to newspapers
and they would go to networks and
various but they would also make sure
that they got some prominent voices
that were persuasive to say what they
wanted to say
did you see a number of prominent voices
that were on the side of
controlling the bank run and taking care
of it well you did now I'm not saying
that they were
I'm not saying that they were CIA
influenced I'm saying that's how they
would do it
which is different from any individual
being part of that so I'm not making an
accusation about any individual
I'm just saying
wouldn't be surprised
oh somebody says me no no nobody nobody
contacted me well that's a good point if
nobody contacted me
but would people think that I was
pro-cia
or a Critic of the CID
how would you interpret my public work
as a Critic of intelligence agencies
50 members of whom signed the laptop
from hell
disinformation
well somebody says I'm both and that's
fair yeah I'm both because I think we
need the CIA
but clearly you know if you look at the
the behavior of our intelligence
organizations in the last several years
they do seem weaponized against us and
they do seem politically politicized so
I've been saying that for a long time
all right so here's
here's my question to you if the CIA
had the legal ability to manage public
Minds
and and brainwashed people would they
act against their critics
do you think the CIA would act to
minimize their critics
some say yes
because it's legal it would be legal to
um
to protect their own brand
if they could argue that that was good
for the country oh yeah we don't want
the CIA to be dismantled that would keep
the country in a weak state so we'll
manipulate people into thinking we're
awesome and one of the ways we do that
might be to get rid of our critics
do you remember when the newspapers
canceled me
but suspiciously only Democrats seem to
be really really angry
whereas conservatives once they were the
once they heard the context I was
talking about conservatives almost to a
person said he shouldn't be canceled for
that even if they didn't like it even if
they thought you know I was over the
line or too offensive
pretty much conservative said you know
still it's not cancelable in their
opinions
and pretty much it was just Democrats
versus Republicans in the end
so my first take on this was that it was
really political
meaning that the newspapers wanted to
get rid of me and anybody was a Democrat
wanted to get rid of him and I would say
that
if you look to the last several years
anybody who was paying attention could
see that I could move the dial
how many would agree with that statement
that in the realm of politics
that I can move the dial I can actually
change people's opinions in a way that's
important
right so the locals people mostly say
yes they're a little bit ahead of the
yeah you see yeses here now those of you
who don't agree
like there's some no's right so those of
you who say no
the only point I'm going to make is look
at all the s's so I'm not going to say I
am or am not influential
I'm just going to say look at the S's
if the public thinks I'm influential do
you think the CIA thinks so
do you think the CIA hasn't noticed me
do you think the CIA who is an expert on
persuasion doesn't know exactly what I
can do and what I can't do
of course I do they know exactly how
much influence I have and which
direction I'm likely to push it
it is not necessarily in their favor
and then the newspapers canceled me
how many newspapers did it take to
create the run on newspapers it's like a
run on banks like if the first few
newspapers say we must cancel you let's
say the Washington Post
Washington Post was the second big paper
if the Washington Post cancels me do you
think these smaller papers can keep me
in the pages nope it really only took
the Washington Post
because once they took a stand the other
papers just sort of yeah yeah yeah
because the Washington Post is a
newsmaker they decide what is true
for the smaller newspapers
so how much would the CIA have to tweak
a knob to get rid of me as a public
figure
they needed one editor
in one place
to write it to write an editorial and
say cancel this guy that's all it would
take one editor in one place
do you think the newspapers did this on
their own
because they couldn't I'm not saying
they didn't
it's entirely possible it's just what
you thought it was public complaint the
newspapers had too much pressure
newspapers also didn't like me because
I'm critic criticized the news a lot and
so it was just a news thing it was just
business and there was nothing
suspicious here very possible
but
I can't really conceive of a situation
where the CIA wouldn't want to take me
out
and they have the ability
it's one phone call
one phone call cancels me worldwide now
do you think that I will have as much
influence
after being canceled
what do you think
will I have as much influence after
being canceled
well it would be a good bet that I would
go away like Roseanne right if you were
going to bat you'd bet okay it's going
to be a Roseanne situation
you know he might come back in five
years or something but basically he's
off the field for the next election
cycle
somebody says this is not an issue for
the CIA let me tell you why it is
the CIA does want to protect its own
power and its own mission
and I'm a Critic
it's pretty straightforward if people
don't try to get rid of their critics
when they can
I don't know I wouldn't understand the
CIA if they couldn't act on things that
they thought were important
so I'm not going to make a claim that
the CIA decided to cancel me
I'm going to make the following claim
it would look just like this
it would look exactly like this and you
wouldn't be able to know now the problem
is not me because you know I know some
people say when I talk about my
situation it's whining or complaining
I'm not whining or complaining I'm just
describing
my life is fine
I'm in a good place I got I don't have a
problem in the world right
uh
but you should know
that you can't tell what stories are
real anymore if the CIA decides that's
your narrative well that's your
narrative in the in the news will they
only have to get a few news people to
say is true and then it's a big story
everybody's talking about
so if you thought it was hard
for the CIA or anybody else to change
the entire narrative or to take on a
person it's not it's one phone call
it's just one phone call that's it you
can change the whole narrative
which doesn't mean they're doing it it's
just that they could
all right uh Rasmussen did a poll on
designated the cartels as terrorist
organizations it turns out 79 of likely
U.S voters are in favor
of designated the Mexican drug cartels
as a serious threat to the United States
um who would disagree with that I mean
seems obvious right see let me see we
disagree
um okay well 20 strongly disagree with
that 20 but then there's another 10
percent that are not sure
so let's say the 10 percent that are not
sure
yes they found out a little more they
could go either way unless it's one sort
of a coin flip so take half of them and
add it to the 20 oh
yeah that would be 25 percent
or not in favor of it
huh very surprising very surprising
I don't know
um I wonder how many of the people who
said they wanted to be designated as a
terrorist organization how many of them
know that that guarantees military
action
I'm not sure if the people answering the
poll knew that they were voting for war
they're voting for a hot War they sort
of favor of that now I do I'm in favor
of a hot War
um
a limited one I mean one that just goes
after the bad guys but
I can say that loud
all right
um here's a shift in the narrative that
I'm seeing and you can decide if I have
anything to do with this right so your
assignment will be as I mentioned a few
different related stories
to see if anything that happened to me
recently allows people to talk this way
in public
in other words have I had any impact
accidentally on broadening
the discussion Zone things you can say
out loud
here are some things that people are
saying out loud which I'm not agreeing
with this is important
these are not things I agree with the
point is people are saying it out loud
that the problem with Silicon Valley
Bank was a diversity hire
now as people point out you know most of
the leadership was white men
but the person in charge of risk
management
may have been a diversity
let's say influenced higher now I'm not
going to say that that was why the
person got hired I'm just saying that
that's the conversation
and I don't know that we would have had
that conversation out loud before
and the out loud part is okay we should
at least look at whether this was caused
by a diverse a yeah A diversity hire
we should look at it people are saying
that out loud I don't think you could
say that out loud
I don't know a month ago it seems like
you couldn't say that here's another one
South the report is that Southwest
Airlines has consciously
decided to reduce the the risk or reduce
the
safety to get more diversity in their
pilots
that's actually being spoken about out
loud and in the news
that your plane might go down because of
diversity hiring now again this is not
my opinion my only point is that it's
now a conversation people are actually
saying this out loud now
and then the third one Joe Rogan I just
saw he was saying on his his show that
he'd vote for Trump over uh Biden
because Biden's just an empty shell of a
human at this point but he pointed out
that the Biden Administration couldn't
even hire good people because he used
Sam Brinton as the you know the
cross-dressing bag stealing guy used him
as an example of somebody who clearly in
Joe's opinion was a diversity hire and
clearly could not have been the best
choice
the implication is there was a better
choice
so again
I have no opinion on whether Sam Brenton
was brilliant at his job
he could have been
I mean I I don't There's No Smoking Gun
in my opinion this says that any of
these people are less qualified There's
No Smoking Gun but it is part of the
conversation now
and it should be
because it might have mattered
like it might be true that Sam Brinton
is purely A diversity hire now why do I
say that
let me explain to you everything about
every big organization
here's the thing in any big organization
whether it's business or government it
is better to appear woke
because everyone can observe it right
away
you can see it how many people of color
do you have on your board how many
people did you hire what is your
diversity it's just obvious
but
um
that's more important to look whoa
because people can see it compared to
being competent
which is often invisible
do you know what happens if you're good
at your job
nobody notices because there are no
problems right if the risk manager at
Silicon Valley Bank had done everything
right
you would never even known that was a
bank I literally never heard of that
bank
I'd never heard of it the only reason we
even talking about it is that
you know somebody
was not competent
but we don't know if that's because of a
diversity Iris that would be a leap
that's not an Evidence
um
but here's what you can know for sure
managers being managers and leaders
being leaders they will choose to look
good compared to performing well does
anybody disagree with that
if they have to choose now the first
choice we all say is but Scott but Scott
you can do both you can have great
diversity hires and you can have great
performance there's no conflict at all
I'm not saying there's a conflict
I'm not saying that
I'm saying that the managers don't care
if there's a conflict
they're going to manage to what you can
see they're not going to manage to a
long-term output that you can't
determine if it's because of who they
hired or not right the Silicon Valley
Bank is a perfect example
there are people saying oh this might
have been the diversity higher problem
but there will always be people who say
reasonably
there's no direct link
there's no direct link
it's really about interest rates and you
know the the environment and whatever so
you managers will always manage to that
which can be confirmed by everybody the
things you can see
and it will never manage to the things
that can't be proven
the things that can't be proven you can
manage those by the way you talk about
it this is the same reason that a new
leader likes to come in and then change
all the metrics and and the Departments
because what it does is it erases the
past
and so you can't be compared to what
you've done before because once you've
reorganized all the measurements of
who's doing what are now obsolete so you
erase the past and then you say the new
things we're doing yeah they're not
paying off now of course it's early but
these changes I've made if you wait five
years well we'll be in good shape then
I've really set this up for the future
no it's not good now
because it's an investment right so if
Zuckerberg were not the head of his
company
and he said all right Facebook maybe
isn't killing it at the moment but look
what I'm doing with meta
right meta is Zuckerberg's way of saying
we're doing something good that you can
see hey look at this pictures of us and
meta hey look at these goggles that you
wear hey it's all visual
and it diverts you from the fact that
their Core Business doesn't have a
future because young people don't use it
so you see this effect everywhere all
the time it's Universal it's every
company every organization managers
manage to what can be seen and easily
agreed upon by observers especially
their bosses but also the public
so
it's not a case and this is where
everybody will go wrong it's not a case
of uh there are not enough diversity
hires
that might also be the case might also
and that would be systemic racism blah
blah blah but if you have a situation
where everybody has to have
a high number of diversity hires
and everybody's scrambling for the same
limited pool of of people
in the theory and in practice you will
always get lower performance
not because the people are bad but
because the managers will manage to the
look not the reality
does that am I clear enough about that
distinction there could also be a
question that there just aren't enough
you know the limited pool of who
everybody wants to hire because
everybody's looking at the same pool of
people it might just be a shortage of
people that would give you a terrible
result too but you don't even need that
those people could all be better than
everybody else
and the fact that people are managing to
the look still gets you to a bad place
every time
so it's a Dilbert problem
and I would summarize it this way I'd
say that wokeness is a good goal that
became a bad system
I would on top of what I've said already
every good idea
gets ruined by
um
exaggerating it to absurdity let me give
you a concept
are taxes a good idea no some absolute
to say no no taxes I think taxes are a
good idea because it allows you to fund
the military
yeah fund the military
but are the current level of taxes good
no it's too much everything that's good
in small amounts will eventually be
ruined by people who have figured out
how to make money by taking it too far
right when I say that the base idea of
woke is a good goal I got a lot of
pushback
but here's what I mean on day one on day
one it was a good idea by day three it
was already ruined
on day one it looked like you know
wouldn't it be great if we treated
everybody with the same level of respect
and that's what I think wokeness is at
its base
to which I say yes yes on board
everybody should be treated as their own
individual and respect them totally
unless they're individual performance
you know says otherwise absolutely but
as soon as you go from treat everybody
with respect and oh and by the way I'd
like to be called by these pronouns to
which I also say okay you know don't
judge me if I get it wrong but I like
calling people what they like to be
called it's just polite and next thing
you know white people are hired
what
like we immediately went from treat
everybody with respect to everyone
except white people
that's where we are now it's it's
literally just anti-white
now does that mean it was always a bad
idea no no it's like everything else
everything starts as a good idea
it just turns to when it gets
extended by the the grifters and the the
media like everybody's got to talk about
it they've got a signal they've got to
be on that team and actually you know
Drew Barrymore is underneath in front of
a trans activist on her shower that was
big news today
and I think that was a trivial trivial
you know news bit but yeah everything
goes too far
so
[Applause]
here's what I'm going to do
for the world
um if you've been watching me for a
while if you've read my past books you
know that I always talk about systems
being better than goals
and you know that I like to reframe
things so I'm going to show you the
first draft of my four page PowerPoint
presentation the title of
I think you can see it there I'll read
it the racism mindset and the success
mindset
choose one
now
I could just go home after the title
page because that's the whole story
they're incompatible
they're incompatible the racism mindset
or the entire topic has lots of good
historical things we should all know
so in terms of information it's pretty
good
I like the information but if you make
it your focus and you build your systems
around looking backwards you're doing
everything that's the opposite of what
successful people do
and I'll detail that
on this page
so
on one column I showed you an earlier
version of this I'm just refining it
because I think it's important
so on one column you've got the things
that racism cares about Equity well I'll
just read it to you Equity uh focusing
on the past injustices systemic racism
reparations dividing people by race
that's the racism mindset does that uh
turn the things into a presser and
victim model resentment resentment of
current people for not doing enough as
well as old you know the long bed and
then the racism mindset is basically
could be summarized as I can't because
I can't succeed because racism I can't
get this job because racism so it's a
camp because philosophy now the success
mindset has a direct or pretty direct
someone who's a little indirect but
correlation
where what you would do for Success
would be instead of focusing on Equity
you would say how about winning how
about winning
have you ever heard anybody in the
success industry like somebody who
really knows about how to do success
have you ever said if you work hard you
could be average
you know if you put your your muscles
into it and your brains and you work
hard you could be as good as other
people
that's ridiculous the the any success
uh Mentor will tell you why aren't you
trying to win
if everybody tries to win
and we're playing by Fair rules and
we're not breaking any laws the whole
society is better just everybody try to
win
that works how about uh focusing on the
past versus focusing on the future if
you want to be successful you have to
focus on the future it's not optional
nobody ever got successful just thinking
about the past or how about systemic
racism it's a real thing
you can't forget about it can't ignore
it but if you have a success mindset
you're not thinking about what's
stopping you you're thinking
optimistically nothing can stop me oh
your problem is systemic racism no
problem that won't stop me oh your
problem is that you're short let's say
you're a man and you're short no problem
I'll work with that I'll make that work
your problem is that you're less healthy
or maybe you're disabled no problem I'll
make that work
yeah I can make that work
so the success mindset is all about the
problems won't stop you the racism
mindset is all about the racism did stop
you it did and it's going to keep
stopping you so that's what your brain
should focus on
the cleanest one is reparations
reparations is you owe me something
whereas the success mindset is what can
you what can you do for other people
and also reciprocity if you're Jeff
Bezos talk about Amazon right what made
Amazon work
he says and a obsessive focus on the
customer
did that work out for Amazon yeah
I use Amazon specifically because I can
feel their obsessive focus on the
customer you can feel it it's like it's
like an actual feeling right everything
from the one click shopping to how easy
it is to you know reorder things it is
insanely customer focused and that's
Jeff Bezos that's all Jeff Bezos he is
forcing them to be customer focused and
probably there's a big problem when
they're not my guess that you probably
get fired if you lose that Focus for a
minute
now that's a Winner's attitude
but uh looking at things as
you know as reparations you owe me as a
short-term strategy at best
uh the racism mindset you know divides
people by race but if you're in a
success mindset you're uh playing their
odds why would you limit yourself
to part of the public
by you know by thinking that some people
are against you stay away from these
people whatever network is you you try
to meet as many people as you can from
wherever might come in handy
um of course the racism mindset is about
resentment and how does that work if
you're trying to find a mentor
imagine your uh young black person
you're trying to make it in the world
you're in a big company and you'd like
to find a mentor because everybody would
like it's good to have a mentor but most
of them are white
what do you do
if you have resentment toward white
people for racism
it's going to be harder to get a mentor
because I think that resentment is going
to come through pretty quickly like
people are going to notice
yeah you can't really hide it it would
come out in your language and the things
you focus on et cetera and then the camp
because it turns into the can-do mindset
was success
so that's the list the I I think you
should be
um
at least
at the very least you should agree that
the lists don't line up
would you agree would you agree that the
racism mindset the way it's being used
in America is opposite of the success
mindset
that's the thing that bugs me the most
and part of the things part of what is
misunderstood about
me is that I'm coming from everything
from a success filter not a race filter
but if you come from that filter it can
be really jarring
it can be jarring to somebody who's in
the other filter it's very jarring as we
learned but I should also say that you
don't want to ignore history you want to
teach the history of course but don't
focus on it you should focus on
strategies for the future it's just a
focused question don't forget that and
then here's the kill shot all right I'll
read these but you can see it's just
three points
um the kill shot is the persuasive uh
dagger then I'm gonna
put into some people reading this here's
the dagger a child who learns the tools
and strategies of success will do better
in life than one who is taught to see
Life as a racist struggle
how does that feel
how does that feel
yeah
you're killing your kids by teaching
them the wrong frame
you're just ruining their lives and you
know it you can't argue with it because
nobody's going to argue that ignoring
the tools and strategies of success to
focus on Race struggle is a good
strategy
literally no one would believe that and
yeah we're doing it
so that's that's the dagger that here's
some explanation point two the media
raise race grifters well-meaning
teachers see I'm not not insulting
teachers but well-meaning teachers and
professional activists are poisoning
race relations and destroying the future
of black American Kids by teaching them
a losing mindset
do you think the Asian American kids are
are learning to focus on race
or are they learning to focus on
building a talent stack which is
Central to success maybe they're focused
on staying in a jail and not doing drugs
which are essential to success
right now we got to stop pretending that
every culture is being raised with
useful
mentoring messages it's just not
happening some of the cultures are
getting useful mentoring success related
messages and the Black Culture is being
poisoned into thinking there's a reason
that's going to hold them back and
nothing's going to change it
that's what they're taught and I would I
would imagine that the progressive white
part of the population is taught the
same thing
so they would be on board with that but
it doesn't matter as much
that progresses whites buy into that
frame because it's not them
it's not them they're probably going
about their own lives however they want
but I'm watching something that looks
like a black Holocaust
with you know obviously that's hyperbole
I'm looking at something that's a
disaster for black Americans and I don't
think they're doing it to themselves
I believe that white America is allowing
the situation that is the current
situation
to me it looks like the media assigns
people's opinions and the media is still
controlled by white people
so if we have these opinions it's
because somebody told the left and the
right what to think largely and then
they adopted those opinions and those
opinions are not coming mostly from
black people
right it wasn't black people who
canceled me
I had zero cancellations from anybody
black zero
it was all white people
so
I don't see the blame
being squarely on anybody in Black
America
I see the yeah I see the uh
the teachers unions being evil and
they're they're a mixture of everything
I see white Americans
being creating the situation that's not
good for anybody
and
I think the only people who can save
themselves are black Americans
because if black Americans rely on white
people
to help them with their reparations
they're going to get the Gavin Newsom
treatment
yeah oh yeah yeah we'd love to help you
how about you do a committee and come
back with your recommendations on
reparations huh and then I'm helping
look at me being supportive
good good going there
I'm so supportive no only black American
can help Black America
and if you think that I'm talking about
like white tricks for Success no it's
what all black successful people do it's
all what white successful people do it's
all the same
look to the Future be optimistic use
some gratitude have reciprocity just
basic stuff build a you know stay on the
jail build Us Talent stack have systems
over goals there's like 12 things you
have to learn it'll take you 20 minutes
to learn all all 12 of them
right
it would take you 20 minutes
to learn all the techniques of success
20 minutes
and and then you're good to go there
will still be lots of racism but you'll
cut through it like
hot poker through butter
and then my final statement here to
close down is the reason no one told you
this before is because there is a high
social penalty for doing so
there's a high social penalty for being
honest
on this topic
I don't know if you know anybody who had
that issue now my my my problem was not
the honesty it was the hyperbole the
honesty part everybody was okay with
but
I did cause a little trouble more than I
thought
by a little extra hyperbole but I was as
you know
the people who have watched me use this
pattern before
they know that I was causing trouble to
draw a fire
I didn't think I'd draw that much
it was a calculated risk I knew there
was a risk so that's why I'm not
complaining the reason I'm not
complaining is because I intentionally
did something with a high risk that I
had in my opinion a potential High
reward
for the country not for me and
maybe it didn't work out
so far I'm pretty happy with how things
are turning out
so we don't know
we don't know
all newspapers ended up not being able
to run it because my syndication company
and then my book publisher
canceled me
so uh that cancels distribution so they
couldn't newspapers couldn't carry it
even if they wanted to
yeah
so here's this is the message that I
plan to die on this hill
and I'm going to die on the hill that uh
all the ESG CRT Dei are crushing the
chances for black American success and
because they are such an important part
of my country
that's bad for me right it's bad for me
when black Americans don't do well
that's bad for me and that's why I've
put so much attention in trying to fix
that specific situation
um
but maybe the CIA took me out for
political reasons maybe the Democrats
took me out for political reasons the
only thing I know is that the
conservative part of the country
understands this message completely
true or false most of you are lean right
if you're watching this even though I
don't
uh yeah every one of you is agreed every
one of you is agreed look at the
comments
absolutely zero pushback
I got canceled for this
this is the way I did it so it's my own
damn fault but look at the bigger look
at the bigger picture
was canceling me good for Black America
well let me ask you this question
was canceling me good or bad for Black
America because this is what I'm
bringing
right this is what I'm praying this is
my offer
it's free
right and by the way
you don't need to buy it in my books
like I have a book that I think is good
you can't buy it at the moment because
it's canceled but if you could buy it
it would just be one of the things you
could do I'm proposing that the that the
the tools of success are so widely
available you can just Google it
you could pick up a different book you
could ask somebody who's successful I
don't care where you get it that's the
unimportant part
so that's why I'm interested in working
on homeschooling because I think you
could make a difference in the
curriculum by just introducing a module
about personal success
in a module about personal success if
you could do it well
I think would guarantee the
homeschoolers outperformed everybody
else they probably already do but it
would just make it clean
and I would I would make a following bet
that if you gave me a group of
randomized black Americans
or even poor let's say let's say low
income so they're randomized except
they're all low income and you compare
that to a randomized group of white kids
and you say Scott you're going to work
with the randomized group of black kids
you're going to teach them the tools of
success that work for everybody
and then the the white kids will just be
the control group
they're just taught at regular education
come back in 20 years who's making more
money
I guarantee it's my group
I guarantee it
you you should you should place a very
large bat
on that if the group that has the tools
of success does well
I would do it I could probably
uh
making a web series
um
a web series teaching the rules of
success
the trouble is I don't know if people
are watching videos that are longer than
30 seconds
so if I did it it would be a series of
30 second reels
it's probably the only way to do it yeah
because kids aren't going to read it you
can turn it into a course for a teacher
and then the teacher could work with the
kids but uh for mass communication it's
hard to reach kids
you need something really simple
yeah I I'm trying not to say tick tock
because I want Tick Tock to go away
homeschooling is great only if the
parents are well educated that's
probably true although I think that's
changing
my understanding is that the home school
Market is now robust enough that you can
find videos of good teachers you know I
think people coordinate to have maybe
the smartest parent teach a few of them
or something I think they're finding
workarounds but you're true but it's
true if the parents aren't starting with
a good basis of knowledge it's going to
be harder
Charter Schools yeah
I'm in favor of all of those alternative
schooling
things all right that's all I got for
you today
Stevie we'll talk about how the bell
curve Is for Suckers actually I'll do it
right now anytime I have this kind of
conversation somebody says belka or
belker or bell curve and you know what
that means the idea is that the the
racially let's say uh provocative
members of the of the white Community
think that that's the whole explanation
here's why I disagree
most people are average
that's my whole argument
I'm only talking about average people
if it's true that there are more white
people who are genius scientists how
does that affect you and me
suppose it's true
suppose there's a bunch of freaks who
are white that are so smart you know
they're they're the quantum physicists
and stuff suppose that's true
what does that have to do with the guy
who walks in for the job in your company
nothing nothing it doesn't tell you
anything about an individual the fact
that there might be some freakishly
smart people in one group excuse the
average
uh is it isn't there now um
all right so my point is you're talking
about the exceptions now how about Black
America do they have uh an unusual
number of people who because of poverty
and even low nutritional stuff
is there is there anything that's
skewing that average probably right but
if the average person you know the the
people in let's say the 80 bulk
of both the White and the black
population if anybody in that middle 80
percent of white or black
comes into your office for an interview
and they have roughly similar
credentials
you can't tell them apart
you you have no idea who's going to be
good on the job nobody can do that it's
just not a thing right there it's
because the middle is just the middle
the the the
Geniuses that may have been skewing it
and the people who don't have any job
and never will we're skewing it in
another group they're not the people
we're talking about
right they're just not the people so
when you tried to deal with if you're
using an average
to decide how to deal with an individual
that's just nonsense
uh there may be some use for that
information
but I think it's overused
so so I reject it as useful right
I'm not rejecting it as I don't know if
the science is measuring the right thing
or not I don't know how much IQ is
really telling you about success I mean
it's highly correlated but there may be
other things that are correlated that
are they're sort of obscuring the real
thing going on
so those are all interesting topics but
when you're talking about personal
success it's about the person standing
in front of you
it's not about anybody's average
it's the person standing in front of you
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
going to talk to locals people a little
bit more best live stream you've seen
today
join me tomorrow
