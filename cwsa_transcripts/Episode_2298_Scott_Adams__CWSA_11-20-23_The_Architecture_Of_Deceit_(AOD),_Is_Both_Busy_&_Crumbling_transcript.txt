[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization go
you with Scott Adams it will be the best
thing you've ever had happen to you uh
today and possibly in your entire life
maybe the history of the universe but if
you'd like to take it up to levels even
higher than that yeah I know people
think it's impossible but it's not all
you need is a cup or muger a glass of
tanker chel Stein a canteen Jugger flask
of vessel of any kind fill that vessel
with your favorite
beverage I like
coffee I'll even put on my microphone
for
YouTube and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dope mean end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better simultaneous zp
go yeah that was good
stuff how was I sound now amazing
right your flask is your chalice today
now that's a good reframe today my flask
is my
chalice as God is my witness my flask is
my chalice I don't know what it means
but it's kind of cool well I'm going to
start with the important news and then
work toward things that don't matter at
all uh important news an Alabama woman
is on Fox News an Alabama a woman with
two
uteruses uh is pregnant with twins one
in each
womb they say there's a one50 million
chance that this could
happen and as usual the important part
of the story is completely left out you
know what I'm talking about right so a
woman with two uteruses is pregnant in
both uteruses with
twins raises a question doesn't
it does your husband have two dicks
I'm just wondering like how does it work
exactly wrong
question okay well maybe I don't know
anything about anything and how this
works at all but have you ever heard the
uh the saying uh this is an old country
saying he was hornier than a
two-peckered
dog has anybody ever heard that one or
nearer than a two-peckered dog
no well anyway moving on uh anyway
speaking of two dicks uh the Tate
Brothers have weighed in on uh the
xplatform and Andrew Tate says in in in
a
post yes yes if you're just figuring out
the entire story about the Alama woman
was nothing but a segue into the T
Brothers yes that's what it
was there are no accidents
anyway Andrew Tate says he'll spend a
million dollars per month advertising X
on x so just a sport so you know that
Tim pool said he would do quarter
million advertising on X to make up for
the apple and IBM and others pulling out
and uh actually Seth Dylan started that
off that Babylon Bay said theyd put a
quarter million into extra advertising
and then Andrew
Tate
you know no matter what you think of
him you're and I don't think much of him
you know I just have personal issues
with him but he is so good at inserting
him into any news
story and this is the classic he'll
spend a million dollars per month
advertising the xplatform on X you which
has no value whatsoever and that he ends
by telling Elon Musk simply let me know
where to
pay
simply let me know where to
pay do you think there's any chance he's
going to spend a million dollars per
month and the only and the only obstacle
is he just doesn't have the URL where to
[Laughter]
pay I'm sorry it's kind of
brilliant you
for is just frankly brilliant it's so
ridiculous it's it's ridiculous and
exactly the right
am he is very good at this I'm going to
give him that he's just very good at
this well uh so if you didn't see it uh
there's a Photoshop picture of Ronda
santis wearing thigh high boots uh did
you all see that and uh Trump decided to
make that part of
his
and he and he passed it around I got to
show you the picture because ites
doesn't sell the story doesn't sell
itself with without the
picture but I was laughing for about 10
minutes all right so look at the picture
first it's Ronda santis wearing uh
nothing
under wearing nothing under his jacket
but but th high
boots I guess better now this the thing
I love about it the thing I love about
it is that uh you know the the world has
got all these problems and wars and and
Horrors and controversy uh but at the
same time as long as Trump doesn't say
anything important and he just mocks his
his enemies he's he's just sort of
dancing to the the
presidency yeah let let me give you two
impressions of two candidates running
for president all right first Joe
Biden okay that's Joe Biden running for
president the this is Trump with his
current polling
[Laughter]
numbers
ah
so in a movie in If This Were A Movie
and someday it will be uh this would be
called the the second act now in a movie
the second act is where the hero is just
sort of Surfing along like getting stuff
done you know heading toward a goal is
like so if it were a movie the the good
guy would like kill some bad guys guys
and then he immediately go kill some
more bad guys and then in a funny way
he'd kill some more bad guys that would
be like the second act so this is Trump
he just he decides that he's going to
talk about Adam Chef being a pencil neck
and they don't know how he can hold up
his his fat ugly face his fat ugly
head all right but it gets better so
this is what Trump says when he passes
along this uh picture of
DeSantis he says whoever photoshopped
this image should be ashamed of
themselves we do not condone editing a
photo of Ron with pleather thigh high
boots do not send this picture
around oh my
God he he's winning so hard at the
moment he that he could just like kick
back and have fun with it it's got it's
just kind of
wonderful all right but we'll and and by
the the way uh the lesson of this is
visual
persuasion I tell you all the time that
Trump is the the king of visual
persuasion you will never get that
picture out of your head I that picture
is in your head to
stay oh that's
funny well I've taught you this lesson
before but it's going to be important in
this next story so I'm going to remind
you when I was in hypnosis class I had
nois teacher told us that uh when people
make verbal slips you know what you
might call a Freudian slip where it lets
out their real feelings that
um that it really is something that it
really is telling you what they're
actually thinking but don't want to say
out loud now the example given was sort
of a ridiculous one at the time
um the example given was that if you
were uh let's say on a dat with somebody
and you didn't know if they were really
interested in you physically one of the
things they might say as a verbal slip
instead of saying uh that they're hungry
and they might say I'm famished be
another way to say You're really hungry
but they might have a Freudian slip and
say I'm
ravished right if somebody if a woman
says I'm
ravished in the context that you know
she meant famished she's really telling
you she wants to get ravished right it's
kind of a it's kind of a green light now
when my hypnosis instructor said that I
said to myself
no oh I I feel like I feel like that's
too clean of an example there's no way
in the actual real world that somebody
makes that specific kind of
mistake well one day I was invited to
lunch by a cooworker
a young woman who worked with me on a
project and I thought to myself h huh
it's probably just
lunch or is she interested in me in that
other way or is it just
lunch and I sat there at lunch and then
I watched her do something with her
hands that I've never seen anybody do in
any context before her one hand she made
like a circle like the like the okay
sign and with her other hand instead of
having your hands together you know you
know when you put your elbows on a table
and your your hands are like in the the
prayer situation but instead of the
prayer situation she was continually
pushing her index finger of the other
hand through the hole that she made with
her left hand she was literally
her hands while talking to
me and before the and before the meal
came she said and I swear to God she
said this I'm ravaged I'm
ravished and I sat there and I thought
are you kidding
everything I learned in hypnosis class
is literally
true like I didn't think that was
literal I thought it was just an easy
example to make the point I didn't think
anybody would really do that in the real
world she and I were together for 15
years and did I know it was on when she
took me to lunch I did when she said
that and it was you know later I found
it was exactly what she was thinking so
keep that in mind
that it's not just a funny story it's a
real thing and you see it all the time
and the and the what the hypnotist
learns is that it's not just these real
obvious examples like that it's all the
time people will always choose a word
that reveals what they're really
thinking if they're talking quickly now
this doesn't apply to a prepared speech
a prepared speech you would make sure
you got rid of all the little tells but
if you're speaking off the co off the
cuff
yeah it comes out like crazy now Simon
atiba
journalist uh is was uh posting about uh
Dan representative Dan Goldman who's
running for uh the nomination against
Biden and he was being interviewed by uh
Jen
Saki and uh he was talking about Trump
in January 6 and you know blah blah blah
Trump is bad Trump is bad and then he
summarized the Trump is bad stuff by
saying quote Trump has to be
eliminated he has to be
eliminated have you ever heard that
phrase in politics before in American
politics has anybody ever
said uh that my my opponent should be
eliminated yeah let let me tell you what
that means exactly what you think it
does it means that at all costs
basically has to be eliminated suggests
it's an
emergency and if any of the things that
he says about Trump are true then you
would expect that assassination would be
on the table if any of the TDS that he
believes about Trump were real you too
would think oh he's Hiller we got to you
know he must be stopped at all
expense so we all know what that
means and you can completely understand
how we got here now by the way if you
asked him does he mean that he would
obviously say no but it's it's a a a
very clear tell of inner thoughts now
you're going to say to me I was waiting
for somebody to say it but you haven't
said it yet Scott you can't read
minds no you can't read minds when it's
in the mind as long as it's still in
Inside the Mind you can't see it at all
when you do these verbal slips that's
when what's inside your mind literally
becomes a signal outside your mind now
that doesn't mean it's 100% there's
nothing that's 100% but this is this
specific one just like I'm ravished is
about as specific as you can get right I
would be amazed if this doesn't mean
exactly what he thinks it does now I
don't think that he thinks it would come
to you know physical violence like I'm
sure he assumes that you know there's
plenty of Alternatives you know without
getting there just you just have to get
there so I'm sure that's what he'd say
but this choice of words
suggests that there might not be a limit
to what would be appropriate to keep him
out of
office and believe me if I believe the
things that Democrats say about Trump
that he's literally a dictator and
Hitler and trying to take over the
country and he'll never leave office if
I believed any of that
I'd probably be thinking privately I
wouldn't tell anybody but privately I'd
be thinking you know if something
happened to him wouldn't be so bad you
know so that's what I think is going on
of course nobody can read mine so you
can't be 100% certain but boy does it
look exactly like what it looks
like all
right um Argentina's uh got a new
president aier m m I guess and uh
yesterday when I was doing a live stream
from my man cave uh people were pouring
in all excited about him I didn't know
who the hell he was so I had to do a
quick little lookup I guess Tucker
interviewed him so that made him known
to a lot of people at least on the right
and he's a
Libertarian and he hates wokeness
doesn't like wokeness doesn't like the
Iranian influence in his country
uh is apparently very
pro-israel uh more anti-iranian than
pro-israel I think but pro-israel he was
there flying you know waving the flag
and it wasn't entirely popular so he's a
anti-abortion anti-woke but
libertarian not not right leading per
se I guess he was and he's just an
exciting character and he wants to get
rid of useless parts of the government
and so people are saying hey is this
Argentina sort of leading the way you
know is is there something
happening where you know Trump is doing
well in the polls and and you know this
guy wins in Argentina are are we seeing
some kind of a repeat of 2016 where
there's brexit and then there's Trump
and and then there were some other
leaders in in his
likeness maybe I mean everything's a
pendulum right the pendulum only goes so
far before it swings back well I believe
uh that's exactly what's happening
pendulum is starting its very clear
swing
back um there's a story in Fox
News that uh Obama they say showed
little public support for Biden at some
recent event uh so what does that mean
for Obama showing little public support
that's kind of subjective isn't it so if
you're a consumer of news and you're
looking at Fox News and fox news says
that they would frame it this way Obama
showed little public support for Biden
it could be entirely
true but I would ask you to remember
this is Fox News giving you a subjective
impression of
Obama like you know you got to put that
in context but
um whether whether or not they
accurately saw that situation I suspect
that they did cuz if Obama had gone full
Biden that would have been a new story
itself wouldn't it if Obama had got
given like a full-throated Biden
endorsement that would look weird
because you know Axel Rod who looks like
Obama's henchman you know they're pretty
close you know Axel Rod sending out the
signal you know maybe age maybe a little
too old you know so it would be
surprising if Obama gave him
full-throated
support um but at this point I think my
my hypothesis is looking very strong and
it looks like this that nobody on the
Democrat side including the bidens
themselves including Jill Joe Hunter all
the bidens that all of them are the same
opinion that Joe should not
run I believe even the bidens agree but
the bidens specifically have have a
problem of staying in a jail and I
believe that Joe is holding on so he can
protect himself and protect Hunter
especially maybe his
brother yeah full throat in Flynn um
and is seems to me that it's obvious now
would you agree because Biden is not the
one who bucks the uh
Democrat majority he's he's the one
who's most identified as being their
person like he's the most kept animal
within the entire kennel so if he's not
doing what everybody else wants
including Obama including David Axelrod
there's something going on that has
nothing to do with politics would you
agree that whatever the reason is that
there's this disagreement between Biden
wanting to run and everybody else
wanting him not to on his own
team it has to be something personal
and you could imagine it's just old man
doesn't want to change his mind but I
don't think so doesn't have that feel to
it does it because he's not he's not
giving off that Vibe of old man can't
change his mind he does still look like
he's mentally flexible you know even
within within his current state of
degradation he does still seem flexible
he's not the old man yells at this guy I
won't change my mind no matter what your
facts are he's not really that guy
so it looks like he just has a real
personal problem that's uh at odds now
here's the correct the correct comment
from uphill Garder in all caps Scott is
mind reading again now I'm calling that
out myself I'm not saying I can see what
he's thinking I'm saying that the
external s signals are narrowing down
the the
hypothesis right the hypothesis that
Biden thinks that running would be good
for the world I think is eliminated
because his team isn't supporting the
idea that him running is good for the
world I don't think that's his reason so
again we can't read his mind and that
was exactly the right comment I that's
the kind of comment I appreciate because
you should definitely call me out if you
think I'm reading somebody's mind
because I do that all the time and it's
a very good discipline now so I think I
supported it by saying there are
external signals and you can't know for
sure
all
right my theme today continues to be the
architecture of Deceit is crumpling the
architecture of Deceit would be all the
the entities that are funded by uh
Democrats and Soros and the government
and the the news media that's working
with them and the Intel agencies that
are working with the Democrats and with
the news media and that collectively you
know they build this uh story or
narrative and the narrative built by
this complex or what I call it the
architecture of Deceit the
aod um is starting to come apart so the
a number of stories that I'm going to
tell going forward in today are going to
have that same character to them where
you can see the narrative start to come
apart number one Eric Adams U mayor of
New York who I got to say I'm just
starting to love that guy is anybody
else having the same reaction he's a
Democrat but there's something about
him that's right I I don't know how to I
don't know exactly how to say this but
there's something about him that's right
now he's a Democrat I know a lot of you
don't don't like him you're going to say
he's woke and blah blah but but let me
make my case hold on a second hold your
judgment just let me make my
case so as you know he is been a
proponent of do something about
immigration and he seems to be a convert
to the idea that you can't just ship
them into a city and you know let them
do whatever they want so his reaction to
it is he's announced in order to pay for
all these people that are in New York
City he will cut funding quite a bit to
schools sanitation police and
libraries now here's what I think I
think Eric Adams is
aggressively following the Democrat
plan I believe he is embracing and
amplifying something he knows he has to
break and so he's instead of fighting it
as in hey you got to give us money or
hey you have to fix the Border he's
embracing it saying yeah well of course
we're a sanctuary City and of course
we're going to pay for it because that's
what we said we'd do and of course we'll
take sacrifices the people who live here
will take sacrifices because that's what
we said we do that's the plan I'm I'm
agreeing with you Democrats let's do
this let's get rid of those police
remember you wanted to do that right you
wanted to get rid of police and what
about that education well you know we'd
love to have schools and libraries and
sanitation we'd love it but you know
we're not those people we're not the
cruel people who would kick immigrants
out so we're going to take a little from
ourselves and we're going to do it
overtly and so that we can help this
group of
people how do you think that's going
over well uh cardi B has a video out
today in which she's talking to the
public and she's
pissed so cardi B who I don't think has
been identified with any right leaning
politics before is just saying what the
hell are you doing letting in all these
immigrants and and cutting all these
valuable
Services now you saw that Michael rapor
actor who is you know super antitrump
has come out and said in public well
maybe I was totally wrong and he's
thinking about voting for Trump now
cardi B coming from a demographic of the
public that is
most traditionally most opposed to Trump
and she's just saying flat out
this Democrat stuff is crazy just it
basically it doesn't make sense I'm
these are my words now hers but the
current situation doesn't make sense by
anybody's political
preferences it doesn't make sense it
just doesn't add
up so example number one of the uh
architecture of Deceit crumbling and it
goes like this Eric Adams I believe
cleverly
so I believe this is his actual plan now
I don't know this so if you said you're
mind reading you'd be right on this one
so this is speculative I believe that
what he's doing is trying to teach
Democrats the following
thing money doesn't appear because you
want
it the money you have is the money you
have most of the time and if you're
going to decide to give a lot of it to
someone else you're going to have
less and I think he's making uh
Democrats understand you get that this
isn't free that you specifically are
going to have less you're giving your
stuff to these people these people being
immigrants who are lovely people I'm
sure but it has to do with the system
and integrity of system not the
people um so I think Eric Adams is doing
a real solid by making it clear that you
have to choose have you ever heard me
say that Democrats have what I call half
opinions is not a real opinion an
opinion would include the good and the
bad of any decision well I've considered
all the downside but you have to look at
the upside I I decide the upside is more
than enough to compensate for the
downside that would be an opinion a half
opinion would be Sanctuary cities that's
a half opinion because it doesn't
consider what it what happens to the
people who are already living there so
Eric Adams turned their half opinion
into a full opinion and now they're
going to have to deal with it as a full
opinion because he made it real he
didn't just talk about it he made it
real you know that cop in the corner
gone you know those you know teacher
raises gone you know those books you
wanted to check out of the library gone
see that garbage that's sitting on the
sidewalk that's what you wanted I mean
indirectly so that's a little uh little
crumbling of the architecture of
Deceit I saw a um uh a post I think it's
real but maybe not only because the name
of the person posting it was Dr
Charlotte
proudman now maybe that's just a real
name proudman but spelled like a proud
man anyway Dr Charlotte says whenever I
lack of self-confidence I just ask
myself what would a white privileged man
do and then I have my answer
let me read it again whenever I lack
self-confidence I just asked myself what
would White Privilege man do and then I
have my
answer well as the prince of fakes
account who pointed this out notes quote
she's one reframe Away From
Success she's one reframe Away From
Success because you know what would be
the best advice I could ever give
anybody that you couldn't get better
advice than
this look at what a self-confident white
privileged man does and then do
that because if you just did what
somebody who expected a success does
somebody who expects it I expect success
so I'm going to act that way that would
be a really really good way to act so I
feel like she was so
close so close to understanding what's
going on that yeah if you act like like
success is owed to you but you still do
all the right things to get success and
you act confident on your pursuit of it
yeah that's just about the best advice I
could ever give anybody so yeah do
that all right here's some context for
you on the architecture of Deceit I saw
this from Benjamin Carlson post on x um
he talks about a 1980s interview when he
shows the video of journalist Lewis wolf
and exci agent CIA agent John
Stockwell and this is a story that the
journalist and the excia guy says uh
that has talked about the media uh the
CIA um manipulating the media in the
United States and one of the things that
he said in the interview is you know he
was asked how far does it go and he
talked about the CIA delivering
literally packages that the news would
just run they would actually give them
the video give them the story and the
news the news would just run it it was
just the CIA and apparently that was
widespread but here's what the ex CIA
agent said back then he says it goes
beyond your wildest imagination the
extent to which the CIA has gone to
manipulate public opinion it talked
about setting up all kinds of fake
organizations and funding all kinds of
fake things and having all kinds of ties
to reporters and the media and all
that
um
anyway so so we have you know a
eyewitness of somebody who was involved
in it but this comes from the 80s in the
80s what was it that stopped the CIA
from doing all that
stuff between the 80s and
now not nothing nothing stopped
it why would
they why would they so if you look at
your uh architecture of Deceit how much
of that is from the CIA probably a lot a
lot yeah the CIA is an expert in setting
up um bunch of fake organizations so
that one organization can support the
other one so in other words the news if
it wants to run a story can say hey fake
organization say what's true and what's
not and then they report it but really
they were both fakes but one fake uses
the other one as their you know their
Source like it's a real
thing so do you think that that
stopped you think do you think the CIA
just stopped doing
that
no no of course not now once you
understand
that the architecture of Deceit starts
to come into
focus and you start seeing organizations
that have been let's say very
anti-republican in their in their
approach even if that's not the name on
the organization if it's not part of
their Charter but they seem just very
targeted at
Republicans coincidence probably not
probably not all right here's another
thing that makes you raise your eyebrows
so also as speaking about the Argentina
election I saw a post on the end
wokeness uh account uh which is a real
good fun account to follow and wokness
um the Argentina had you know up to 30
million paper ballots and they countered
them in one day and gave the
result 30 million ballots they just
counted him up and gave you the
result now Maricopa had only 1.9 million
ballots Milwaukee uh less than half a
million Detroit qu million and Fon about
half a million but Argentina had up to
30 million
ballots Canada them all up no problem
but we couldn't get that done the United
States but I have a bigger
question I believe every expert would
agree with the following statement can
you give me a fact check on this fact
check every expert in elections would
say that paper ballots and multiple
people watching them being counted and
Counting them the same day is the best
system am I wrong about that because you
never quite know if the machines will
work and everybody would have questions
about them anyway might be a little
harder to audit because you can't see
the code right but you can always see
the
ballot so here's my question why do you
think the United States has machines
when there's probably no expert who
thinks it's the best
way I can only think of one
reason I think the you're seeing it with
your own
eyes or on YouTube you're seeing this
yourself
right and have you noticed that the
other times I've glitched it was the
same
topic has anybody noticed that it's
always it's always election integrity
and YouTube
glitches you you just watch this with
your own eyes and how many times have
you seen it now uh do you tell me on
YouTube if you watch me regularly have
you seen it glitch on this topic at
least three times three different days I
think I've seen it at least three
times yeah I'm seeing some yeses at
least three times on the same
topic you think that's a
coincidence be a big coincidence
wouldn't the the the level of
obviousness now so this is another
example I don't know that that wasn't a
coincidence but when you look at it in
context it's hard to believe it it's now
and you know that my my traffic is kind
of Flatline for years on YouTube where
everything else I do is going up YouTube
flat yeah I'm sure that's
organic anyway um
my assumption is my working
assumption is remember that the working
assumption in general is that uh
citizens of the United States and I
would say everywhere else as well are
innocent until proven
guilty that has to be your your standard
a citizen is innocent to proven guilty
but you should not use that standard for
the government if you're talking about
the entity not individuals but the
entity the government is absolutely
guilty until proven
innocent that's the only way the system
works in other words the government has
to prove they're not lying to you they
have to show their numbers they have to
be open to audit they got to be able to
show you the ballots they got to be able
to show you the process if you do a
foyer request they got to they got to
show you the documents right so the
government is 100% guilty unless they
prove otherwise and and what do
electronic voting
machines
do they make it essentially impossible
to prove that an election is
clean now you also nobody's proven that
there's any evidence that an election
was rigged in any major way right so I
have to throw that in there so I don't
get kicked off of social
media there's I'm not aware of any
evidence that the 2020 election was
rigged in any non-trivial
way but I can't think of another reason
for having electronic voting machines
can you CU they don't there's no way
that they're less
expensive they add
complexity they make the public doubt
the the outcome and they add an element
that is either hard or impossible to
audit in other words I'm pretty sure we
do not have access to the internal code
of the you know of the companies that
make the machines now just to be clear
I'm not I'm not accusing anybody in
the uh in the electronic voting machine
business of any
impropriety I'm not aware of any I'm
just saying I can't think of another
reason that you would use their product
unless you wanted to make sure that you
could cover up fraud
so
um is is everybody disagree with that
why would you use the expensive
complicated worst system when you have
access to the same system everybody else
has and everybody everybody who's an
expert would agree it's a better
system I only see one
reason all
right um here's another crack in the
system do you remember uh it was less
than a year ago that I got
cancelled and as was part of that larger
conversation I've said many times in
public recently that uh when I work for
a big Corporation
that both of my bosses told me directly
that they couldn't promote me because I
was white and male still am still white
and male and the reaction to that from
uh black
observers um usually editors and writers
and you know fairly prominent black
observers they said you're probably
lying you know since they assume I was
racist anyway they said you're probably
lying about that and can you can you
Pres present any evidence can you give
me any evidence that that happened to
you now my first reaction was it was 30
years ago or no longer than that yeah it
was like 30 years ago and my bosses
would be quite
elderly but I could I mean I know their
names I don't know where they live
anymore but I could tell you their names
and if you wanted to talk to them if
they're still alive they would tell you
exactly what I told you but when I said
that it still sounded like an excuse and
I recognize that now so it sounded like
hey you've got a gigantic claim that's a
really big claim and people said really
why wouldn't you Sue or you know of
course you couldn't Sue in those days
for that at least it didn't help you if
you
did so do you know what my new approach
is instead of saying yes there might be
two elderly people if you hunted them
down they might support my story do you
know what I say
now do you you know any white
people go go to any white person you
know who's male and ask them their
experience I will give you I actually uh
check to see how many there are uh I
will give you 120 million
eyewitnesses 120 white men in the United
States and 100% of them will tell you
the same thing everyone so my claim is
not that there are two people in the in
the world who will back up my story no
my claim is that there are 160 million
of them and that every one of them every
one of them 100% not 99 not
99.9 100% will back up my story and they
will tell you their own
experiences now here's what's
changed less than a year
ago uh a lot of well-meaning and I think
honest you know Brokers were say saying
I'm not sure that's really true cuz
imagine if you would go on the last 30
or 40 Years of your life never hearing
that and you'd only heard that there's
discrimination against black people
which of course there is and you'd only
heard that and then somebody says
everything you knew was wrong for 30
years what would be your reaction no way
yeah right so the people who doubted my
story are completely rational players
they're they they were not being in my
opinion they were not just being team
players although there's a little that
but they weren't just disagreeing
because they were team players they
really had never heard of
it
and and they might ask how could there
be 120 million people who have the same
opinion and experience and I've never
heard
it simple look what you did when I
brought it up if I brought it up you all
said I'm a lying piece of racist
why would 120 million people want to be
lying piece of racists there's a
very obvious reason that we didn't bring
it up and also if you looked at the news
during that period a lot of people
brought it up there there were in fact
lots of what they called Reverse Racism
suits it was wildly known but it was
always anecdotal there's this one guy
who's suing oh here's another one guy
suing so if you were just watching the
news you'd probably think anecdotal few
examples is it has in no way does that
describe the larger situation no wrong
it was exactly the larger situation all
120 million people will tell you so you
know what I say now I say you don't you
don't know a single adult white
man who knows you well enough to tell
you the truth you don't even know one
adult white man cuz there's no way you
would believe that this isn't happening
if you knew even one adult white man so
that's way better than saying you've got
this one example just say it's
everybody
um Rasmus and uh at a poll said
uh uh that a majority of Voters don't
believe that Muslims and America are
victims of unfair treatment now they had
some you know detailed results that I'm
uh I'm not going to talk about for the
following
reason what's the point of asking other
people if you think a different group is
being discriminated
against for the LA I just told you that
for the last 30 years if you had asked
black Americans do you think white men
are discriminated against America they
would said ha you idiot
no and yet it was the major thing
happening in America for 30 years so you
can't ask the group that's not being
discriminated against if they think some
other group is being discriminated
against right so
um I think you can only ask the group
themselves what their experience is and
even that's
subjective all
right
um so Jonathan tle is talking about this
story that uh there was a federal
magistrate that issued a major ruling on
this Bakersfield College in California
saying that they uh violated the First
Amendment rights of a professor Damon
Johnson with its Dei mandate so
basically it's a ruling saying that de
Dei went too far in one college and but
it's important case turly says uh
because it challenges the claim of
universities that their Dei policies are
suggested practices versus mandatory so
I guess the col the colleges have been
getting away with saying oh well we have
these suggestions but it's not mandatory
but as soon as somebody doesn't follow
the suggestion they get
canned so it's not a suggestion and if
it's not a
suggestion well then there's going to be
greater legal challenges I think so this
is one more example where a Dei
um will be uh I think it's on its way
out but it'll it'll put up a
fight um V
ramaswami is uh did a little video
talking about the advertisers who as he
says
sanctimoniously paus their ad spending
on X he says they're
cowards and that it is different when
individuals consumers decide to boycott
so if an individual consumer decides not
to get Bud Light that's perfectly
legitimate but does it make sense for a
public
company
to uh do what the stockholders did not
vote on that's pretty
important and it looks like it looks
like these companies and this is for
fake take uh he says there one thing uh
if you want to use your own money to
Signal your own personal values it's
quite another to use corporate money so
basically on behalf of all these
stockholders that may not want what you
want to engage in personal virtu sing
langu which is what these executives are
doing and then he also points out it was
based on a false pretense anyway uh
because it was based on a
misinterpretation of what Elon mus said
so it wasn't even accurate they weren't
responding to a real
thing and they were responding with
other people's money so thank you for
being wrong and spending other
people's money to show us you're awesome
while being wrong with other people's
money they should all be fired that's
like a sign of
incompetence here's a uh a way to know
when you're looking at the architecture
of deceit as opposed to a legitimate
entity and Mike Ben on xplatform has
been great about
this um and here's an example example of
it Ben Collins um
disgraced disgraced urist Ben
Collins uh I'm doing what the left likes
to do they they like to just throw in
disgrace like it's a fact if you don't
like somebody or you don't like
something they said in the past you just
throw in
disgraced now the funny thing is he is
actually kind of disgraced yeah there
there's a lot of criticism about it
but he was uh angry because I guess musk
is going after Media Matters
for um you know allegedly lying about
the the the degree at which the bad
adverti or the advertisements were
paired with bad
content
and um there's a suggestion that there
might be a criminal remedy for that as
well as civil so musk is suing them in a
civil way but at least one person thinks
it might be criminal what they did and
so Ben Collins says
so uh you know what I said about
so when you start a sentence with
so I call it the so tell it's a signal
for cognitive dissonance whatever
follows the word so on social media is
something which is misstated in a way to
be ridiculous to make your
point so disgraced journalist Ben Colin
says so they're going to lock up a bunch
of Media Matters researchers for
noticing that racists love this website
share a go for it now okay what followed
so uh they're going to lock up a bunch
of Media Matters
researchers oh
researchers so as Mike Ben has taught us
and there are lots of examples to back
this up
researcher is what you call somebody
who's really just on the payroll of
somebody trying to push a narrative you
call them researchers but they're really
narrative
pushers so that's um a matter of opinion
there and and they says that the reason
they would be locked up is because they
quote and notice that racists love this
website no that is not exactly a good
summation of what's
Happening not at all so uh yes every
time you see researchers and and media
ERS does say that their people are
researchers they actually called them
that they're
researchers um so look for researchers
as your signal of fakeness uh and as
Mike Ben points out the same framing is
used to laer DHS censorship Stanford
internet Observatory Mass flagging and
crisis PR Ops and countless other
economic coer jobs custom built to kill
Free Speech says
mike all right there's an NBC poll that
says that uh Trump is leading Biden by
46% to 44 in a general election poll now
of course we don't have general
elections we have Electoral College
situation so the Battleground States
matter more but it would
be insanely revolutionary and unusual if
the Republican won the popular vote so
that would be a big deal cuz even Trump
didn't win the popular vote when he
became president
so but more importantly a subset of that
uh poll said that Trump is leading by 46
to 42 among voters in the 18 to 39 years
of
age whereas Biden won this group by 26
points in
2020 can this poll even be
real do you believe I mean this sound
crazy doesn't it do you believe that the
Young people 18 to 39 pick Biden by 26
points higher than you know the vote for
Trump but that in that time that's
reversed so much that Trump is actually
leading that
vote well first of all I would doubt the
polling but let's take the uh let's take
the assumption that there's a big move
maybe not that
big maybe okay you're you're a second
guessing me ahead of time
here what is missing in this data uh
let's say it's true that the
18-39 group has moved massively to Trump
what did I leave
out is there any is there any data you
would like to know about this group 18
to39 that that moved massively to Trump
what what's the obvious
question gender they left down
gender do you think that the poll uh
discriminated by gender of course they
did they always do they they always ask
men women Democrat Republican
right why don't you think that was worth
mentioning I don't know I don't know
what the uh the breakdown would be but
here's my
speculation it's all
men it's all
men you you saw Trump go to the uh UFC
fight and uh Joe Rogan was talking about
it they didn't just cheer for him as Joe
Rogan was pointing out they almost
lifted the
roof like it it was like apparently the
situation was pandemonium when he walked
in and you know there's nothing more
male than UFC obviously as female fans
do but there's nothing more
male I
think the young
men will save
us I think young men have figured out
they have to take some leadership
there's a leadership Gap and I think
they're taking it now they do it in a
small Way by moving their
votes they're going to do it in a bigger
way yeah they're going to do it in a
bigger way and I'm very curious what the
breakdown was if any if anybody sees it
could you tweet it at me cuz I'm
guessing that the movement was almost
all men do you want to take the other
side of that bet does anybody want to
bet that it wasn't well I'll say mostly
not all but I'll bet it was uh a
majority men were the ones who Moved if
the polling holds up as which is a
question all right and to me that's the
bigger story to me the bigger story is
the the gender switch I've been saying
for I don't know five years now that
Democrats are the party of women and
there's nothing wrong with that and and
the Republicans of the party of men
nothing wrong with that but they're
different and if you're a man who's a
Democrat you're in a weird world right
at least the women who are Republicans
agree with the men who are Republicans
so they're on the same side right but if
you're a Democrat and you're uh you're a
man your group hates
you and if you're a Jewish man and
you're a Democrat you really got some
questions you're really asking some
questions this month aren't you wait a
minute I thought Jewish men were welcome
as Democrats well not as much as you
thought but definitely welcome as
Republicans all
right uh on the xplatform uh one of my
favorite follows got
swatted um any of you follow Dom luer l
u
re real real good follow lots of good
content I recommend him what you need to
know because it's important to the story
is that he's a black man with dreadlocks
and um someone with a VPN so they were
Anonymous contacted the police and told
him he was barricaded in a room trying
to kill his girlfriend and he doesn't
have a girlfriend he doesn't have one at
the
moment
and uh so but here here's the good news
the good news is that the police force
was professional and checked with them
and did not do something crazy so they
they basically checked with him first
and then you know they still showed up
had to do the report and everything but
it didn't get
dangerous now here's my take on
that if you call in a fake SWAT
call on anybody you're putting them in
danger would you agree you're putting
him in
danger it's basically a murder it's
attempted murder in my in my opinion
it's attempted
murder now let's now let's uh enhance
that and you you call let's say let's
say you called in a fake SWAT on a black
guy with
dreadlocks now you're a little bit more
murdery aren't you that's a little extra
murdery cuz you know you you might
expect well police might have some some
kind of
biases to me this looks like attempted
murder so I this can't get
worse that's that's really a
bottom all right um CNN is reporting
that that shifa hospital and the tunnels
that they
found
um are not compelling
meaning that CNN is not yet convinced
and they have reporters on site so CNN
has people on The Compound at the
hospital and they've been taken around
by the IDF to show them that Hamas was
there and they showed them some
weapons and CNN's take on the weapons is
it doesn't even look like they were in
one place they might have been relocated
and it wasn't that many for for some
kind of a big story it wasn't really
many weapons and they were shown a
tunnel which uh the IDF says is 55 um 55
ft
long and they're not allowed to go down
in it and apparently there's nothing in
the tunnel there's a doorway at the end
that they have to break into somehow so
that's be a whole operation but it's
just a blank tunnel of 55 ft and CNN to
their credit to their credit CNN CNN is
not buying
it isn't that interesting CNN's not
buying it now they're not saying it's
not there they're they're saying that
the evidence is is short of
compelling now what's going oh was it
meters 55
M did I have the did I have the
measurement wrong I think somebody was
correcting me
there but here's my take if it's if it's
one little uh
piece of uh
tunnel oh somebody says 165 ft but if
that's all it is they better come up
with
more better come up with
more
um but uh and then and then I have heard
from other sources in Israel that the
fog of war is pretty deep and that also
um it's really slowo looking around the
compound because things might be booby
trapped so it's super
slow um but we're still expecting that
there'll be you know major compound
under the
hospital
yeah all
right so keep an eye on that I don't
think that the hospital
story um should have any power over us
no matter what they find there
cu no matter what they find in the
hospital you know Hamas is still Hamas
they still have human Shields they still
have hostages I mean it doesn't make
them any better or worse no matter what
happened at the hospital but of course
the public will try to make a thing out
of it no matter
what there is a story that I don't
believe for a minute that there's a uh
possible deal to secure more of the
hostages and that Hamas uh is is asking
for a 45 day pause in fighting and part
of the reason is that they need the time
to collect the hostages from different
places so they need to pause so they can
get them together and they would you
know give some of them 50 of
them do you believe any of
that I don't believe any of that first
of all there's no way in the world that
Israel would agree in good faith to a
5-day pause there's not any chance of
that secondly if the deal is not all of
the
hostages I don't think Israel is going
to take the deal because it looks like
what Hamas wants to do is you buy time
so I think they want to release 50 to
establish that they will release
hostages then the pressure on Israel
would be tremendous because people would
say hey they already gave us 50 and it
was just a 5day pause imagine if you did
a full pause how many you get there
right so it it's all about public
reaction and you know you hate to say
this about hostages but they they are in
the context of war and Israel is going
to have to make the war decision the war
decision would suggest that you should
not make this deal even if it's
real would you agree even if the offer
is real that a 5-day pause gets you 50
hostages I'd say don't take
it now you can't you can never admit
that to the public you could never tell
the public yeah they offered us 50
hostages and we said no never never you
can never say
that but from a military
perspective uh what would happen is that
after the
50 the public would guarantee maximum
pressure on Israel to pause again to get
a few more back
you see what I'm talking about that the
50 is the beginning of a of a keep
pausing them keep pausing them so homas
can recover and get their public
relations in order and build a narrative
and stuff like that oh we're good guys
we're just giving you back you people
yeah Israel cannot allow them to do the
slow
drip that probably most of the public
would want them to
do if you ask the average person who's
not really following it they're not
they're no military expert they don't
even know the history of the region
don't exactly know what Hamas is up to
and if you said hey we could give 50
hostages back with just a 5-day pause
and then we go right back to it right I
mean it's not like we're stopping it's
just a 5-day pause any average person
would think that was a reasonable
offer but it's a terrible
idea now I hate to say this in public
because I know they're real families
with real hostages and to them nothing
would be more important than getting the
back and I get that and and if it were
my family uh I would be pushing as hard
as possible for the pause let me say
that
directly if it were my family or even
somebody I was you know a little bit
closer
to I'd push for the
pause I don't think it's the best thing
for the is Israeli operation but if it's
my family I'm pushing for the boss you
know I'll take that chance that my my
loved ones are in the 50 I'll take that
chance so it's a very good strategy by
Hamas because it's a genuine Division I
mean it's really going to cause a
problem but I think Israel would be um
ill advised to accept
it and I also think that it's a fake
story I think it's a fake story in the
sense that if Israel is acting like
they're going to take it what they're
probably doing is collecting uh Intel by
pretending to negotiate so for example
if Hamas says we need time because the
hostages are in different locations then
Israel just learned that the hostages
are in different
locations kind of good to know they
might learn some other stuff like um any
complications or you know anything about
the hostages or what it would take to
gather them up might be a little more
information so I think Israel is
pretending to be interested but there's
no way that they're going to make that
deal that's what I think could be wrong
meanwhile ESG is dying in America um the
flows into ESG funds are slow slow to
reversed uh but here's the interesting
thing ESG is still big in
Europe why would ESG be dying in America
and fairly quickly but not in Europe
what does America have that Europe
doesn't
have yeah
me
just me that's all you
needed I'm just
kidding as far as you know well Amazon
is offering free AI courses proving once
again that my predictions are amazing so
the courses are free and they're not
just for Amazon employees so it would be
courses to teach Americans how to use uh
how to use
AI now remember when you thought AI was
going to take your job
and I said well it's definitely going to
take some jobs no doubt about that but
if you work with it for two minutes the
first thing you learn is oh wow you're
going to need a trained human being
using the AI or you're not going to get
anything that's useful so of course for
every AI application that gets used
there has to be a trained
person I'm not I'm not even sure if it
won't increase employment you know it
might be the kind of job where a lot of
people could easily easily learn to use
it you know you don't have to have a
Yale education to use AI sort of
ordinary person you know two days of
study and you'd be practically an
expert so uh I think this is more of a
hint that AI will uh increase employment
instead of decrease it and it will just
be another tool like computers were you
might not be old enough to remember when
people thought that computers would put
people out of work it's funny when you
think about it isn't it isn't it funny
to look back and we thought that
computers would put people out of work
well they did they did put people out of
work but the people who got work was
just immensely more than the people
would put on work so I think that's
going to be the same with ai ai will
definitely put people on work but they
might have a better job which is
learning how to use AI to do some new
thing all
right
um let's talk about Sam mman and
Microsoft all right nothing about the
story of Sam mman being uh fired by uh
open AI none of it quite makes sense so
I'll just kind to keep you up to date
but keep in mind that even as I'm
talking all of the facts may have been
reversed everything's changing so
quickly that you can't even talk about
it without it being you know obsolete by
the time you're done with the sentence
here's what we think we know according
to the news so you know Microsoft uh has
a$3 13 billion investment in open
AI so the company that fired Sam Alman
and then Greg Brockman you know left too
um largely controlled by
Microsoft now Microsoft's stock
apparently dropped when Sam Alman left
or was fired
then there was talk about the uh I think
500 members of the staff out of 700 550
and 700 uh told the board to resign or
they would can you even imagine that
imagine being the board and 550 of your
700 employees signed a letter saying
either all of us are going to leave
that's the whole company basically
either the whole company quits and they
would all be easily employed if they had
AI experience or or the board has to
quit have you ever seen anything like
that I've never seen anything like that
and the number one name on the list was
Mira
mirati who was but is no longer the
acting
CEO or president the acting president so
the acting president was a CEO CEO
acting CEO I think uh signed the letter
at the
top
now
allegedly the solution if you want to
call it that is the a new
CEO is being hired this guy EMT
sheer and he used to be uh the founder
of twitch he's one of the twitch guys so
you know lots of
experience um what do we know about
him what do we know about this uh emit
here well I saw some uh research by
research by Joshua
lysek uh super super ghost writer and
here are some things we know he's uh not
really big on President Trump and he's
been vocal about
it
surprised
no
um when uh msir was the twitch
CEO um an anti-white transgender
activist who identified as a deer was
appointed to the safety advisory
Council you feel uncomfortable
yet let me just say it again because the
first time I said it you probably were
like what I I I feel like I heard you
wrong we'll try it again the new CEO of
the the you know arguably the most
important company in the world open
AI uh his prior job as twitch
CEO uh they employed an anti-white
transgender activist who identified as a
deer and that was who was add of the
safety advisory
Council
so uh so the indications are that he's
uh you know sort of a super
Democrat now are you worried if an
intelligence is created by somebody
who's a super Democrat or even a super
Republican same
problem it feels like a problem doesn't
it feels like a problem now let me ask
you this question and this will blow
your mind you
ready what were the political leanings
of Sam Alman go what were Sam alman's
political leanings
go you don't know do
you you don't
know I some saying left
libertarian center
right how awesome is that I got to give
Sam mman
credit he he does not easily identify
with anything now I'll give you a little
behind the curtain information I don't
think he'd mind I did meet with Sam mman
several years
ago when he was considering a run for
governor and he was just talking to
people who kind of were in that space
just to see what they thought and I'm a
Californian so I'd be an obvious one to
talk to so I talked to him for I don't
know an hour or so uh strictly on
politics and I left not being entirely
clear what his politics were and it's
not because he's
unclear it's because I think he's a
pragmatist and pragmatists don't make
sense in our world a pragmatist is
somebody wants to do the things that
work and not do things that don't
work that's how he struck me he struck
me as a pure pragmatist do what works
don't do what doesn't work so those of
you who are saying he was left leaning
did you know he's one of the biggest
investors in nuclear
power and F Well Fusion in
particular didn't see that coming right
so he's a pure pragmatist and um that
was exactly who you want to add a new AI
you want somebody who you say you know I
feel like he leaned this way but then he
was on this side on this and it's not
entirely clear that's exactly who you
want in that job you don't want the
person who politics you know for
sure but that's what you got but it gets
better um
Ilia
suer who was on the Bo and uh I guess
everybody seems to think he's the
smartest guy in Ai and really the the
the brains of open Ai and uh I think
musk said he you know tried to recruit
him and he's like just the best
guy and he seemed to be maybe even the
one who is behind the firing of Sam but
uh this morning he posts I deeply regret
my participation in the board's actions
what it's only better if few
days I never intended to harm open AI I
love everything we built together and I
will do everything I can to reunite the
company well good luck with that so we
still don't know
exactly um what was going on but it
looks like it seemed to be a clean the
the best thinkers and I think I agree
with them is that there was a difference
about how fast they go and we're told
that the new CEO there's a suggestion
he's kind of a uh a slow on AI guy
because I think he posted that that
would be his preference to go slower on
AI so but here's the weird part remember
I told you Microsoft has this you know
giant chunk of open AI enough to have
functional control over a lot of what
they
do the the result is that Microsoft
hired Alman to be the CEO of quote a new
group that will do AI
stuff what's going
on uh so
Microsoft has you know this 13 billion
investment in the the biggest most
successful Ai and they take the you know
the deposed CEO and they put him in
charge of Microsoft's own
AI
presumably he'll recruit from open AI
like is he is he allowed to kill
Microsoft's other
project because I wonder if uh the the U
CEO of
Microsoft
um I wonder if this is his
play do you think the play is to suck
the employees out of open Ai and build
within Microsoft a fully owned AI so
they they don't have to deal with open
AI
anymore at the same
time musk commented on a post in which
Microsoft said it was planning a $50
billion uh build out of uh data centers
for AI specifically for AI $50 billion
doar nothing of that scale has ever been
even proposed by anybody ever so it
looks to me like Microsoft's play is to
own Ai and the $13 billion they put into
uh open AI I think they're willing to
burn that would be the baller move of
all baller moves if they if they burn
their own $13
billion just so they can control it
better because that's what it looks like
now it's way too early to know what
anybody's thinking or what anybody
strategy is but on the surface it looks
like Microsoft is doing a an unfriendly
takeover of their own
investment now if they've got a 50
billion um you know Data Center and Le
let's say that they have this huge
advantage in AI because they have the
data center it looks like that's their
play they want to make sure they own
that
business they kind of need to own the AI
too cuz because you don't want open AI
someday saying you know what we've
decided to take our business away from
your uh your data center because I think
they could do that right and with the
current ownership could not the board of
um open AI say you know you've built
these data centers but we don't have a
deal for that so we're going to go to
the Amazon because they offered us you
know a better price could they or would
it would Microsoft have had the clout to
make them use their data centers no
matter
what well I don't know but I do know
that if Sam mman works for Microsoft
he's definitely going to use their data
centers so that question is answered at
least
Forman
and if if it if it means that Microsoft
is going hard on AI I'm I think I'm in
favor of
that and here's why uh I understand the
argument of the slow AI people because
we don't know what the dangers are
totally understand it but I'll tell you
one way to lose for
sure is to reach uh reach AGI or the you
know the strongest version of AI uh
after your adversaries do by far that
has to be more dangerous than going fast
and getting there
first would you agree there these are
unknown so you can't actually know what
is the bigger risk but I would be way
more afraid of China getting the the the
world class kind of AI before we do so
in my perfect world Microsoft which I
believe is a responsible you know
well-managed company uh with America's
best interest in mind I believe that
about
Microsoft um that's kind of a good
stewardship for something this important
to the you know the the military and our
entire existence
I don't know where else I would put it
you know you apple as much as I complain
about them being a racist company Etc
they're also very capable so there are
there are some big companies that you
know nobody's perfect but if AI has to
be somewhere that's a lot of capability
to wrap around is so that's better than
China getting there first I think so I
guess I'm a fast AI
guy if there were some way to stop it
worldwide then we could talk about that
but you're not going to stop it
worldwide as soon as you slow down China
will speed up if they're
smart all
right well that's what we know today
ladies and gentlemen this concludes the
best presentation you'll ever
see
and uh YouTube thanks for joining and I
will uh see you tomorrow and remember
the architecture of
Deceit has become clear but it's also
crumbling talk to you
tomorrow
