good morning everybody
wow
you are so good looking
as always
and sexy i know i don't want to leave
that one out
how would you like
to take this moment
up a notch
it's already the highlight of
civilization that's why you're here but
we could do better can't we take it up a
level all you need is a cup or a mug or
a glass a tanker chelsea stein a
candidate jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
correction
uh correction i i've been saying a
vessel of any kind
uh but apparently one vessel you do not
want to put your beverage in
would be a uh a russian
missile cruiser
so let me revise this uh
copper mortgage glass tank and shell so
i'm cleaning
a vessel of any kind except for a
russian
missile cruiser
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day it's
the thing that makes everything better
it's pretty good already isn't it it's
called the simultaneous
it's going to happen now go
well
let's take the wayback machine shall we
dial it back one year ago today one year
ago
things we used to believe were true
one year ago
the russian military was highly capable
one year ago
china
is really good at handling pandemics
oh what we have learned
suppose you had taken the opinion that
everything we think is true is wrong
how would your predictions have turned
out
pretty darn good
just assume everything's a lie
everybody's lying everything's wrong and
every information
uh that comes across your
your consciousness is probably false or
out of context or somebody's trying to
manipulate you
um
on one hand
you would be
quite mentally ill if you lived in a
world
that was like the actual world
ima imagine if you were conscious all
the time
of the fact that everything's wrong and
everybody's trying to screw you
you really couldn't go on could you like
your
your brain would explode you just
couldn't handle it so we live in this
lie where
where sometimes people are you know are
being unselfish and
uh
yeah everything's fine
so you have to have some some kind of
like a little uh fake movie running in
your head just to keep yourself sane
well here's the newest news on the
twitter and elon musk situation
so the vanguard funds which own i don't
know trillions of dollars of assets
they just upped their own ownership i
think they would have been just behind
behind musk's ownership they
bumped their own up ownership over 10
excuse me
and
they usually are a force for management
stability
now
isn't that interesting
you know what what are the odds
that uh somebody like vanguard
would need to come in and even get
involved
and then you've also got this
prince from saudi arabia
walid whose name i can't remember
which i don't mean to be offensive i
literally just can't remember his name
and
he's a you know big famous investor and
he owns a lot of
twitter as well
you know relative to other owners
and he says no he rejects elon's offer
but he's just one stockholder however
a big one
now
why is it everybody's getting involved
and you know max boot is
is sort of the voice of democrats in
some ways
uh you know he's he's against it because
he wants more
more what do you call it
more moderation
in social media not less but more
moderating of
of the unproductive content i guess
so
what do you think
and it wasn't there some kind of
the government is sort of looking into
it and
gonna be opening the hood and seeing
what's what's going on with elon's
various enterprises
so why did this become
like a world war
you know how did uh you know just a
billionaire buying a company
which you'd think would be the most
routine thing in the world
a billionaire
bought a company
pretty ordinary stuff
but this one's not ordinary
is it because everybody feels
the stakes
do you think people have finally figured
out
that twitter is not
just another media platform
do you think everybody figured that out
twitter's not just another media
platform
twitter is where opinions go to be
formed
because the people who tell the public
who isn't paying attention what to think
they all get their thoughts from the
collective beehive that
that is twitter they're not i don't
think they're getting it from facebook
or instagram right
i don't think any of the journalists are
going to tick-tock to get an opinion on
the ukraine situation but they're going
to twitter to do it
so twitter is where people learn to
think
and what to think
at least the thinking people the people
who influence other people
so twitter is where you influence the
influencers
it's the most important platform in my
opinion i mean you know i'm open to a
counter argument but to me there's
nothing even close
to me that the reason that
trump
conquered twitter
is because it's the one that matters
conquering twitter is what makes you
president
conquering facebook
is what gets you more
instagram followers
right i don't know
so
i think the world has now figured out
that this is sort of a
civilization altering
situation and they want to they want
their team to be on the right side of it
whatever team they're on
but
here's my uh here's my take
could we all agree on the following
generalization this is a generalization
so it won't be true in every case
but don't you think that the group that
is most afraid of the truth
is generally the most in favor of
censorship or some would call it
moderation
is that fair to say
the the entity most afraid of the truth
is also most in favor of suppressing the
truth
i mean that almost just seems like
it's not even reasoning it's just a
definition of really nothing nothing
really to argue about there
so
why is it that we've seen this a lot of
people have talked about it this
censorship flip
where it used to be the left
was all about hey free speech
and the right was all about hey there's
some things you shouldn't talk about
let's not talk about that
and then it seems to have flipped
where the conservatives are by far the
ones talking about free speech
and the the left is by far the ones
looking to suppress it
with their opinion would be that it's
dangerous
that some kinds of speech
are just dangerous
now
why why the flip
now first of all do you believe that it
flipped
because you know with the conservatives
we're talking about maybe music and art
you know but this is more about politics
so it's not exactly the right the same
thing that flipped
but but on the topic of
um yeah a lot of you say yes it flipped
so why did it flip
here's my take i just tweeted this so i
don't know how much people hate it yet
if you go back oh just go back as far as
you feel like it and would you would you
say that the following is true the
conservatives
used to be a god told me
kind of a party like you know god first
then god tells us how to act
and then from that the constitution and
the country was formed
so really it's sort of flowing from god
through the policies right
so wouldn't you say that it wasn't too
long ago
that the the conservatives were
connected all the way from policy
through the bible
right
what would you say today though
isn't it interesting how many people
that are being identified as
conservatives or
conserve conservative heroes even if
those people are not conservative like
elon musk
it seems to me that conservatives went
from a god told me model
which is
hard to defend
it's hard to defend
i'm not saying it's wrong
i'm not in that argument so i'm not
going to tell you what to believe or not
to believe i'm saying that some
arguments are simply hard to defend
and if your argument is the policy
should be x
because god informed me
you kind of want to shut other people up
a little bit
it's like well let's not talk about this
too much i we don't need to delve yeah
we don't need to too much depth on this
now again
i'm not saying that there's anything
wrong with that point of view
it's not a criticism i'm just saying
that you can't defend a belief
right would you believe that i mean
that's why it's a belief
we wouldn't call it a belief
if it were easy to describe it to other
people and other people say oh yeah i
get that and i see what you're saying i
changed my religion immediately because
of the logic you've presented
so i would say that what trump brought
to the conservatives was do what works
do what works
trump still maintained the religion
being important
but important because it works
you know the the people who organize
around a faith
seem to do pretty well and it seems to
be healthy for the country
independent of whether anybody got the
right faith so to me it looked like the
conservatives went from
a hard to defend i'm not saying is wrong
that's a different argument
just a hard to defend position
to an easy one to defend
take
take nuclear energy
nuclear energy was sort of a
conservative thing
and it was always easy easy to defend
in fact
the very reason that nuclear energy is
now you know more popular than ever is
partly because of climate change of
course
but
it's because
the logic was there when you looked into
it
as long as there was no censorship as if
you looked into it it was just a good a
good idea
so conservatives were on the side of
something that was simply a good idea
if you looked into it the the math
the math just works the science works
so i would say that conservatives are no
longer afraid of free speech
because free speech
is complementary to their worldview
which is does it work
if it works
let's do more of it
whereas i would say that liberals went
from something really easy to defend
equal rights for all
you go back to the 60s 70s a liberal
would be like
uh let me let me sing and
do art the way i want if somebody
doesn't want to watch it that's fine
they have the right to not watch it but
let me be free in my art
and
have equal rights for everybody
those are really easy to defend aren't
they
so why would they need any censorship
they don't need any censorship they're
selling something that's really easy to
defend
equal rights for everybody
but what happens when equal rights for
everybody
turns into just bad crazy stuff do
i even need to i'm not even going to
give you
the examples
because when i say that the left has
turned at least part of the left has
turned bad crazy i don't like to
say the whole left right it's part of it
um you know what i'm talking about right
so if you're if your views went from the
easiest thing to defend equal rights for
all do stuff that's just obviously bad
 crazy
you need a little censorship don't you
so i don't think there's any mystery at
all
to why conservatives are in favor of
more free speech
and and the left it wants less of it
it's because the people who have
reasonable world views
can can stand the extra light
and the others can't
am i wrong
now does that feel right that that what
happened was
what happened was that the actual world
views changed from practical to
impractical and that was the switch
from practical to impractical now i
think the conservatives were always
practical
but when they explained it in religious
terms which was the dominant way of
doing it
it didn't really
feel sensible to people who were not
already in that that camp
but now but but what what would be a
typical conservative argument today
if you don't control the border
too many people might come over
and put a
you know put a pressure on your social
systems
which we would like to save for our
citizens
that's not hard to defend
if you're out if you're a conservative
you want to say
let's see all of it bring your cameras
down to the border
you show the border just show us all of
it
all right let's let's talk about
everything all the data
right the conservatives can can stand
that light
but let's say you did the same thing
with the school curriculum the
you know what's being taught to kids in
school do you the pandemic showed
that our school system couldn't stand
sunlight
because when kids were home zooming the
parents got to figure out what was going
on and that's when the trouble started
so
uh there i don't think anything really
changed in terms of how people saw
censorship it's just that their actual
opinions went from
from you know
good but hard to explain
to just good and easy to explain do the
stuff that works
and liberals did the opposite
i'm looking at your comments to see if
i'm getting any agreement on this
because i wasn't sure it was
am i off by myself or does that sound
like it actually explains what happened
all right a little bit of agreement all
right
so the washington post
hilariously and
and this is something good twitter's
good at because i wouldn't have known
this except i saw it on twitter
so a washington post must have been an
opinion piece
uh now remember the washington post is
owned by billionaire jeff bezos
and
it's a there's an opinion piece in jeff
bezos publication
about musk's uh potential appointment to
the board so he didn't get appointed but
most appointment to twitter's board
shows that we need regulation of social
media platforms to prevent rich people
from controlling our channels of
communication
so
the washington post
knows that the public is so dumb
that they won't realize that this is
being written in a publication
one of the arguably two most important
classic publications you know mainstream
publications the washington post that's
owned by a billionaire
probably for the purpose of controlling
the narrative
i would think that's at least a little
bit in his mind don't you think
so
it's it's not as if the person who wrote
this is not aware of it
because of course everybody who writes
for the washington post i think
knows who owns it
so
i think this depends on the reader not
knowing
who owns the washington post now let me
ask you this
in our in our little bubble
that all of us are in because if you're
watching me right now talk about this
stuff you're in a little bubble
what percentage of the public
would even know that the washington post
is owned by jeff bezos
what do you think
five percent
i think it's closer to five percent
i don't think it's anywhere i'm seeing
estimates
like 30
it's nowhere close to 30
and nowhere near that
most people don't even know what the
washington post is
if you want a real wake-up call
just ask them what is the washington
post literally just what is the
washington post
and only 80 of people will even be able
to answer the question it's like i think
it's a newspaper or something
you we are completely
we meaning all of us
involved right now
we are so blind
to how little the average person cares
about any of this and is aware of who
owns what and you know what media
conglomerates are doing what
very few people
now the truth is that we very few people
actually become the influential ones not
not just the people watching this but
the people paying attention
are largely the ones who are moving the
needle so you don't need to convince
everybody but it's really a wake-up call
when you realize that
almost nobody pays attention to this
stuff so you can get away with saying
anything
because people aren't going to check
glenn greenwald summed it up well in a
tweet he said yesterday was a flagship
day in corporate media it was a day they
were forced to explicitly state what has
long been clear they not only favor
censorship but desperately crave and
depend on it
and he says even if musk doesn't buy
twitter never forget what yesterday
revealed
to which my thought was uh that is a
really smart tweet
and glenn greenwald you should you
should definitely follow him i mean his
his material is always
fresh and smart even if you disagree
with it you'll still get something out
of it
but here's one where i say to myself ah
yeah i love what he's saying and so i
agree with it but
99 of the world
is completely unaware
of any of this so
i don't think the world is going to long
remember how the corporate media
embarrassed itself yesterday
i don't think 99 of the world was even
paying attention
i think one percent of us noticed and we
kind of knew
how things worked anyway the the one
percent who already were
pretty cynical
well here's another example of the how
the second amendment
works
uh if shanghai had gun ownership like
the united states has legal gun
ownership
do you think that shanghai would be in a
lockdown
now i'm not saying they should or
shouldn't be i'm no medical expert but
it wouldn't happen
i'm pretty sure it wouldn't happen here
now i've heard horrific stories and who
knows what's true right
but that the pets are being executed
because they don't have any way to care
for the pets so if you had a pet
you have to be
you know maybe you have to go to
quarantine or something but they execute
the pets
can you imagine executing pets in the
united states
where there's gun ownership
do you know what wouldn't happen in the
united states
you wouldn't execute my pet in front of
me
that that's what you wouldn't do
because if you execute my pet in front
of me
that's going to be a murder situation
one way or the other i mean somebody's
going to get murdered
so
you you i don't think we can
underestimate how powerful that second
amendment is i mean it really does work
and i think this is a clear example
now um
have you ever seen
a thing called
karma really do its thing
and we've seen it in politics a lot
right the the people you think oh my god
that's a terrible person next thing you
know they're
they're being you know
disgraced in public
it feels like karma's real doesn't it
have you ever noticed that i mean i i
see no reason it should be
like i can't see any mechanism that
would make karma actual actually work
but the number of times it feels like it
works oh you're a little bit ahead of me
so i'm not going to give you the whole
background of the story but there
there's there was an individual who
let's say
had made it his job to make my life
unpleasant
and was spending serious time coming
after me
for i don't know didn't matter just
i guess i had said some critical things
about his uh his cult
if he makes if you make fun of
somebody's cult i guess they come after
you
so it's somebody who came after me with
a weak attack and i was mostly ignoring
it uh but there was a little news item
that he's
uh
he just he's going to jail for
sex trafficking
and i say to myself
i don't
sometimes karma
sometimes karma
yeah his last name was
tate i believe t-a-i-n-t
andrew taint
anyway uh that happened that kind of
made me happy yesterday
did you see the story about uh the
moskva that's russia's uh cruiser
and uh they tried to tow it back
and it sunk
it sunk on the way back
uh
and that's not really
really cool if you're russia
now
that's the way the story is reported but
you know the story is always it's always
propaganda anytime this war so don't
really believe anything
right the official story
the official misinformation story is
that there was a missile maybe ukraine
fired it it hit this you know their
biggest
biggest flagship in their uh the black
sea and maybe it wounded it critically
and when they tried to take it back it
it sank
but we've been fooled before right
remember when you thought that putin was
really trying to take keeve
but we found out really his play was to
not take eve but rather to that's just a
head fake and he's really going to take
the don bass
so really sometimes it looks like he's
they're trying for something big
but the real goal might be something
more limited it's a standard military
thing and i think that's what's
happening with the moskva
um
because
some of the people who are really better
at this military analysis have noted
that
it's not so much that the missile
cruiser
sunk
it's more that it's a staging itself for
an attack on spongebob squarepants
his pineapple
and
some could say that that would be putin
scaling back his ambitions from taking
all of ukraine
to maybe
seriously wounding spongebob squarepants
and
possibly even damaging his pineapple
so that's happening now
but
in the other world
in the other world
um i saw a uh
a
tweet from some expert who has a
contrarian view of ukraine
and it is really
it is really fascinating when you when
you read the opposite propaganda because
i don't think there's anything that's
really
true
but at least anything we're saying i
wouldn't know it i wouldn't know that
what was true if i saw it
but the the propaganda is so opposite
it's it's really a head spinner because
you can look at the same facts and come
to opposite conclusions
right here's here's one one movie in one
movie
russia never meant to take kiev and you
can tell that because they brought so
few forces they were just trying to bog
down that part of the army the ukraine
military and then when they'd done that
they would do what they did now and
circle most of the ukraine military that
had been amassed near donbass and
they'll circle them they're already in
the process of eliminating all the the
fuel sources fuel depots
and food sources and stuff for the
ukraine military and at this point
there's no question
that uh that russia who does have better
supply lines will be able to outlast the
ukraine military they'll encircle them
they'll starve them
and they'll destroy them now mostly
they're looking for these
these bad characters we're told the the
the so-called neo-nazis paramilitary
forces that are in that region that
putin keeps calling nazis that he's
trying to get rid of
so that's one story now in that version
putin is basically already in the end
game and he's definitely going to get
what he wants
which is he's going to destroy the
ukrainian military capability and then
kind of do anything he wants
or at least ukraine is going to be
really really flexible because he might
want to keep zelinski in power
but let zelinski know that he can
mow down ukraine again if he doesn't do
what he wants
uh and some say that putin really wants
to just totally eliminate the as off
people and you know the
the sketchier
elements
so that's one view
the other view is that the uh
the naval battle has been won by ukraine
and because the biggest ship is sunk and
the and the rest of their fleet
apparently pulled back from the coast so
i don't know how effective the navy is
at this point is the navy even in the
battle
is navy important i don't even know if
it doesn't matter
so he says the musk is being retrofitted
as a submarine
uh all right
so
so one
one view would be that uh zielinski save
the capital and beat back the russians
with their clever attacks
and that now the ukraine can focus on
the battle in the south
so and and now they've taken out uh
russia's
you know seafaring capabilities
um they still have some you know russia
still doesn't command the skies so you
could actually tell the story in which
heavy equipment is coming into the
ukrainian military etc
but i think i would agree with this one
military expert or lots of them actually
who say that it's really just a supply
chain
war right because it doesn't look like
anybody can wipe out anybody
except
squeeze their supply chains
so doesn't it only come down to that now
it's a supply chain war and if you could
understand who's going to win that well
you know how it's going to go
i think
yeah i know the navy sits offshore and
shells interior targets but i don't hear
that happening a lot
i'm not hearing reports that they are
shelling from
the navy or from the
sea
and i'm not sure they have the right
they don't even have the right assets
there for that do they
because the missile cruiser is gone the
rest of them were not missile cruisers
were they or were they i don't know
oh somebody saying that russia
stockpiled tons of supplies for seven
years well we did see reports that their
operations in the north
of ukraine
were running low on supplies
but we don't know if that's true
because i'm not sure that anything
anything makes sense at this point or
anything is believable at this point
all right rasmussen as poll says if the
elections for congress were held today
uh a generic republican would give 47
percent of the vote and generic democrat
would get 39. that's a pretty big spread
it's a nine-point spread and so that
would certainly indicate that the
republicans are going to sweep
everything
but
it's down from 11.
and 11 is down from 15
at the start of the year there was a
15-point spread between the generic
republican and democrat now it's already
down to nine
what exactly happened
that made the democrats look better
the last few months
quick
named their successes in the last few
months how in the world could that even
happen
how does ukraine ukraine
you think ukraine is helping the
democrats somehow
i don't know maybe putin prays like
um well most of the shift is coming in
independence so
almost all of it is independence why are
independents moving
now it makes sense they're the only ones
that can move like nobody else is going
to move but why are they moving now
oh
supreme court
supreme court baby huh
abortion
i don't know
um
the lgbtq stuff
it's hard to say i don't really i don't
see a reason for it really
but maybe it's something that
republicans are doing that's turning off
the independents
instead of saying what are the democrats
succeeding at
what are the what did the republicans do
in the last few months
that made them look especially bad is it
the january 6 stuff
yeah okay
well i wouldn't get too cocky
um
if i were republicans because
the one thing that's the most
predictable thing is that this will
narrow until
election day don't you think
don't you think that gap will just keep
narrowing because there aren't really
that many undecided people
people are gonna people will gravitate
to their teams just like they always do
i i think saying you're independent
is just a luxury that you have so people
don't ask you too many questions and you
don't have to make a decision or at
least tell people your decision until
last minute
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen
is my content for today is there
anything i missed
how many of you think elon is let's say
i think mark cuban was saying that elon
musk is just playing a game and he's
going to sort of pump up his price and
maybe screw with the fec or somebody
and that it's really sort of just a game
and he's going to make some money and
sell his shares
i don't think it's a game
yeah i don't think it's a game at all
i think that he does everything with a
twinkle in his eye but that's just a
style
so we're used to that
yeah and
does it seem to you that the only thing
the left is really afraid of is trump
coming back on twitter
it's really that isn't it
because nobody else really matters that
much to the left do they really care if
the
the characters who got banned come back
they don't really care if the people
with you know 100 000 followers get
banned or come back that doesn't make
any difference
project veritas maybe
yeah
i think it's all about trump
all right
and
what do you think is going to happen
with the truth network
nobody's ever solved the problem
that
conservatives will come to a platform
used by
the left
but the left won't go to a platform used
by the right how do you solve that
that doesn't seem solvable does it
yeah so it feels like trying to solve
the unsolvable
somebody was getting mad at me on
twitter today i finally had to block
them it was somebody who was complaining
that i wasn't doing enough me personally
enough to promote their cause and their
cause was i'm gonna use very general
language because there's some topics i
don't even like to talk about
but let's just say that there's an issue
that on twitter
there is a
content involving
underage people
that you wouldn't want
anywhere right
and
um
so somebody who was active in that area
trying to try to get it off there
was saying hey can you help us get
get elon musk on board with getting rid
of this material
and to which i thought okay i'm not
going to get involved in this at all
because number one i don't believe that
twitter doesn't take down that material
when you report it do you
do you believe that if you report
inappropriate underage material on
twitter you think they're not going to
take it down
now somebody said there have to be
enough complaints
i'm not sure that's true
i mean i think that
maybe it puts a higher in the rank or
something but the fact is as long as
people are willing to get caught and
taken down
they're always going to do it so what
exactly would be the solution so i was
arguing that
i'm not going to get involved in
something that can't be solved
and what can't be solved
is somebody with a fake account posting
something inappropriate that takes a
little while to come down there's
nothing you could do about that
and the person arguing with me said no
you could write an algorithm
to which i said there's no algorithm
that knows what you're going to do
before you do it
and i don't know if there's an algorithm
that can understand a video because the
people who would have that content
would learn in well they already know
not to use the standard words right
so they wouldn't post anything that used
keywords that would attract attention
so
you know i found myself in this awkward
situation where it would look like i'm
in favor of something that of course
nobody is in favor of except the people
doing it i guess
just because i wasn't willing to help on
something that seemed logically
impossible
it seems logically impossible now i get
that it might
you might be able to shave off some
minutes between the time it's posted and
the time that
the time that it gets taken down but i'm
not really going to spend a lot of time
trying to save a few minutes on that
that
that doesn't feel like
where the value is
um
yes name that movie
all right that's all i got for now and i
think uh
oh here we go what is it um
you could review content before it's
posted to public well for everybody
see you'd have to do it for everybody
that's the problem
all right that's all and i'll talk to
you
tomorrow
