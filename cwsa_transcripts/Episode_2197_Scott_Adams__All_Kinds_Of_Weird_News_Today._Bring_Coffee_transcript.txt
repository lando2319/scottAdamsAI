everybody
[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of humans civilization
it's called coffee was Cobb Adams
there's never been a better time in the
world to be alive and if you'd like to
enjoy this experience in ways that
humans have never even experienced ever
anywhere in the history of humanity all
you need is a copper micro glass of
tanker Chelsea Style on the canteen jug
of flask of vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous go
all right how did one of you know my
childhood nickname
is there somebody out here who knows me
or was that the luckiest guess in the
entire world
is there somebody here from my hometown
in the Wind of New York
that was too weird
right I'm not going to tell you what it
was because then you'll use it now it
would have been before Harwick it would
have been high school and there was only
one person who used that nickname
yes Skippy
how in the world did you do that
all right we won't talk about that
anymore
well apparently uh X which used to be
called Twitter
is going to add a calling feature
so now they're going to replace the
phone company
I guess
so you know watching whatever whatever
it is that Elon Musk does with Twitter
it's going to be pretty amazing
don't you think I I feel like it's just
beginning
and and you haven't seen anything yet
which dovetails with an article
that was in fiz.org about entrepreneurs
in the age at which they make their
biggest changes and there's some
suggestion based on 2 900 Founders that
were looked at that the older Founders
made more radical Innovations
does that sound true
that the older Founders were
consistently made bigger changes the the
young entrepreneurs would do more more
entrepreneurial stuff so young people
are definitely more entrepreneurial but
they're they're improvements seem to be
more
small improvements on existing things
whereas the older people did you know
complete replacement type stuff
do you think that's true
does that match your experience would
you say that you noticed that there are
a number of you know famous examples of
people started when they're a little bit
older but I would say that Elon Musk is
now in that category of an older
entrepreneur
true
would you say Elon is is over what is he
what's his age 40 something
and
look look at what he uh plans to do with
Acts
his plans for X are not some kind of
incremental Improvement
he's changing it into a whole different
thing so he clearly has the
extraordinary you know huge change Gene
in them at every age
now here's something that I guess I
should I should disclose this
I realized this morning you know how you
should disclose when you've got monetary
connections to anything if you're
talking about the news it's good I mean
it's not I don't think it's a legal
requirement in my case but it seems like
good forum to disclose
Elon Musk is making me money three
different ways now
um and none of this is investment advice
right so this is no investment advice
but during the pandemic I bought Tesla
stock
and that turned out to be really good
so it's up 100 since I bought it
um so he's making me money on stock and
it's actually
of the individual stocks I own which are
only handful it's my number one you know
biggest increase
so he's making me money on stocks for
Tesla
and then you probably know I'm running
the revised you know the Dilbert reborn
comic runs on Twitter as well as the
locals platform
but on Twitter I'm getting subscription
fees now for Dilbert for the subscribers
but and then as you know
um if you have an account that has a
certain size you'll get ad Revenue
when X puts an ad in your comments
Fields so I started getting checks for
that
so if you added the subscriptions and
the ad Revenue together it would
basically be a middle class income
and
then if you had this the stock gains on
top of it it's it's the number one thing
I made money on was Twitter
did you did anybody see that well
actually Elon Musk not Twitter so the
number one thing I made money on in one
category so far this year is Elon Musk
he he made me more money than anything
else did
or he will by the end of the year
of course I got canceled so that you
know obviously changed my primary
sources of income
well I saw another uh article that
waking up early is white supremacy
waking up early don't did anybody wake
up early today
oh you racist racist racist
race is it racist racist racist right my
god there are a lot of races here today
what the hell do you think you're doing
waking up early
how is that fair
it's not fair
well don't wake up early it's weight
Supremacy now I woke up at uh
4 a.m this morning and went to work
uh that makes me a little extreme
extreme white supremacy
for getting up extra early
well most of you are just ordinary white
supremacists you know five five thirty
that's barely trying
yeah all right so
um
I don't know if I've ever said this
directly before or if you heard me
but have you noticed that having a good
argument
doesn't change people's minds has
anybody ever noticed that
have you been alive and in on on the
planet Earth and you know that you're
really tight arguments don't change
anybody's Minds
sometimes if you can communicate your
argument in a simple and persuasive form
then you can get some get some change
right so would you agree that the
quality of the argument is somewhat not
as effective as you might imagine but
the quality of the persuasion let's say
you take away the logic part and all the
details and the data but if you can put
it into some little tight persuasion
package
it could change everything
I'm going to change the entire character
of the United States right now
do you think I can do it
do you think I can come up with a few
words just a few words less than the
sentence
that would change the course of the
United States in a fundamental way
challenge accepted
you ready
black Americans
are denied
the tool of imitation
the only way anybody ever succeeds
they're denied the tool of imitation the
only way anybody ever succeeds
do you know how I succeed
I literally looked at other successful
people they said what do I got to do
and I've been studying successful people
both
um both directly and rigorously like
actually buying a book reading how
somebody did it you know reading about
Steve Jobs biography of course
if you haven't read Steve Jobs biography
are you really trying
are you really even trying to be
successful
there's a whole book
that tells you how the most successful
person did it you haven't read that
are you even trying
are you trying to be successful
how could you not read that
all right I'm just joking with you but
you get the point right have you studied
Elon musk's history of what he did and
how it worked
you haven't
if you haven't done that you're not even
trying
it's the most basic thing you should do
you should look as successful people
find out what they did if you work in a
big company do you already have a if
let's say you're younger do you already
have a mentor
to tell you what works and what doesn't
you don't
why not
that's like basic
you need somebody to tell you what works
and what doesn't work have you read my
book had it failed almost everything is
still went big a whole book
that tells you exactly what works and
what doesn't to be successful
you have it
why not
it's it's simple I mean relative to
other things that you could do to
succeed reading a little book that's you
know tightly written and kind of fun to
read anyway
that's kind of basic
if you're not doing that
or reading books like it you know it's
not the only one in the world but if
you're not reading books on success
are you really trying to be successful
are you even trying
why don't why do I get up early and work
usually at least two jobs
is it a coincidence that my father
worked woke up early every day and
worked two jobs you go to work at the
post office and then come home change
his clothes put on painting clothes and
go paint houses
so he would he just had two jobs
and you know my mother worked in real
estate while she was she also worked at
a factory while she was taking care of
the house and stuff
so why do you think I work hard and
usually have two jobs I'm either writing
a book and doing comics and doing this
it's probably imitation
I think a lot of it's just imitation I
just saw what worked and I said wow that
looks like a lot of work looks really
hard
but I can see that it works so why would
I do something that didn't work
now black Americans are denied this path
that I used
because if they would look as successful
people they would have to act like what
Steve Jobs
does that does that feel comfortable
do you feel comfortable acting like
Steve Jobs if you're a black American
maybe if you're a conservative for
example you might say just tell me what
works and I'll do it
if you're not a conservative you might
say I don't know that's that's sort of a
culture with a different set of
priorities and I feel like I should
you know copy somebody that I emulate
maybe locally
and the trouble is that if you live
where there are not a lot of Steve Jobs
and you've got more you know drug
dealers and criminals
you're probably going to imitate them
because they might be the only ones with
money
and you know money does predict
so
here's the uh here's the thing that will
change
Society
it comes down to one thing
everybody but black Americans can copy
successful people and black Americans
for whatever reason I'm not even sure
exactly you know I don't want to say
culture because I think that's too
dismissive and too easy
I don't think it's genetics I don't
think it's a genetic thing because you
know you see the Nigerians come over and
they seem to be doing great
so there's something going on and I
don't think we need to know what the
problem is but you can very easily
identify what the solution is
the solution is copy famous people
nobody has done it any other way
once you realize that nobody has done it
any other way
imitation is how you succeed
that's the phrase
now I haven't quite got it into the
perfect few words but the idea is that
imitation is what makes you succeed
success is imitation of successful
people
their their process you know not exactly
what they did but their process right if
you're not copying successful people
when did Steve Jobs sell drugs and go to
jail
well I don't think he did don't think he
did so maybe copy that
what was Steve Jobs addicted to which
which substance was he addicted to
none
no well it wasn't addicted
so you could just go right down the line
and you tell me what people who are
successful did if you look at Zuckerberg
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates
when they started to get really rich
did you notice that they didn't act rich
did you notice that they all drove like
old cars and the story was they wore the
same clothes and you know they didn't
really do anything but work they slept
in the office in some cases right that's
all part of the process
because they need other people to do
work for them to continue getting richer
and they want to make sure the other
people are motivated and they don't feel
like they're the only ones working hard
so they make sure that their life you
know looks a little bit more like the
employees now eventually they all give
that up right eventually they build the
billion dollar house but but you can see
that the process is very much about
imitation
did anybody notice that Zuckerberg
imitated Steve Jobs dress style
and imitated I would say Bill Gates
speaking Style
it's all imitation
and if black Americans for whatever
reason and and part of the reason I
don't want to
I don't want to speculate or assume that
I know what that reason is because I
feel like that's just a little bit too
much mind reading or assuming too much
about a group of people that I don't
have special insight into
so I would say that it's up to Black
America to figure that out
but you know exactly what to do
copy people who are not like you who are
succeeding and just keep doing it
and look into what they did ask them get
a mentor read a book about successful
people and just stop copying people who
are going to end up in jail
it's that simple
now I say it's that simple but it's
available to everybody
it's not as simple it's just available
to everybody
so that's uh that's my reframe to change
the world that black people are denied
it's almost like a right
it feels like a right doesn't it the
right to imitate
I mean it's not a right
but I feel like I have the right to
imitate I can just look at anybody and
say all right I'm going to do what you
do
keep doing that I'll do that too
and if you're black
for some reason
the the mechanisms are different and as
soon as I try to tell you why that's
different then I think I lose all
credibility
I think my credibility stops at the door
like I can tell you what works
I'm not going to tell you why you're not
doing it you have to you have to figure
that out you have to figure out why
you're not doing it
I can only tell you what to do
and if you don't do it
I don't give a about you
I just don't give a
now that has nothing to do with race
that has everything to do with anybody
who's not trying
if you're not trying and you're not
succeeding
well I don't give a about you not
at all I have no empathy for that
because you know what the world is full
of people with gigantic real problems
I mean I'm I'm basically running on
empty empty for empathy as it is I got
plenty of empathy but not for people who
weren't not doing the obvious thing to
succeed the obvious thing imitate
successful people
in a similar fashion you you may have
noticed that I was ignoring the story
about the Alabama
doc fight
do you all know that story because it
got way too much press
and I would Echo you know what Greg
goffeld said which is why is this local
story of story but of course you know
the race was involved so it was a big
brawl and it seemed largely wet against
black I could tell from the video
and you can tell me if I missed
something
but let me tell you what I saw
I it looked to me like there was some
disagreement about a doc parking space
and it looked to me like a white guy
through the first punch did I see it
right
did you see a white guy throw the first
punch
 that guy
 that guy
do I care if the black people beat him
to death nope nope no if that's not the
way it went but if it had gone that way
if some drunk white guy threw the first
punch and the end result was that black
people beat him to death
go black people yeah uh totally on the
side of the black people this didn't
happen but hypothetically if you throw
the first bunch I don't have any
sympathy for you if you threaten Biden
and the FBI shoe you're asked I don't
care about you
I don't care about you at all don't
threaten my president
don't punch my citizens stop punching my
citizens and then maybe I'll have some
empathy for you right but I was totally
on the side of the black guys who fought
back is there a second way to look at
this
I don't think there's a appropriate
second way to look at this
but I don't think it should have been a
story either
you know we're we're turning it into a
story because we're you know imagining
it's a story of the whole world
it's probably not
it's probably a story about a drunk guy
who may have been under a Mis you know
misunderstanding or something
but I don't know what it's about but
it's not it doesn't have any national
relevance
so let's stop by coddling people who
start fights and resist resist arrest
and threaten presidents all of them
we don't we don't have to coddle any of
them
all right um Victoria's Secrets is
allegedly uh
changing their uh let's say approach
from uh everybody's beautiful
you know with overweight
models and such
and now they're going back to some kind
of a
classic Model look including some older
ones Naomi candle Naomi Campbell who's
over 50. they're bringing her back
Giselle bundich
over 40. so she'll be part of it so
they're gonna have some Classics but
then they're bringing in some younger
famous people who are also attractive
now
they're they're not fully unwoke
in the sense that they seem to be
changing their approach to include much
older models
you know I I don't think anybody has a
problem with that because the older
models they're using or look like
younger models and that seems to be on
brand
now you know I think I agree with most
of you I'm reading your minds to know
that you agree with me before I ask but
if your entire business is about a
physical female Beauty
it doesn't really make sense if you run
away from it
you know as more of a question should
you exist at all
right if we agree they should exist and
then it's legal and moral and ethical
they should do it any way they want
because the rest of the world can insult
anybody else the way they want they got
this little niche so I think that this
is yet another evidence of ESG and
uh mostly yesterday I guess but any kind
of wokeness looks like it's failing
so we're seeing woken is failing
everywhere
yeah
anyway that's just another example that
um allegedly the uh the Coliseum in Rome
might be a venue for the musk versus
Zuckerberg fight
I still don't know if the fight's gonna
happen
it's possible you know it won't because
I guess Elon Musk had some back problems
he has to get remedied before he can
fight so that seems like a pretty big
risk I mean I don't know how bad the
back thing is it looks pretty bad but
you know you wouldn't want him to fight
if if that's a risk
but I love the fact that people are
talking about a billion dollars in
Revenue raising a billion dollars
and it makes me wonder how much would
Dana White make so I think he would be
organizing it how much would Dana White
make for organizing a fight that brought
in a billion dollars you know that
obviously that doesn't go to him
I don't know he might do it for he might
do it for free
you might do it for free because my
understanding is the money we've got a
charity right
if he organizes it and it makes a
billion dollars for charity can he
really take a cut
do you think you would
I'm going to make you a prediction
I don't know I don't know this for sure
but I think he would only pay his
expenses
I I can't guarantee that's the way it'll
go but I'm gonna make a read on a
stranger because I don't know Dana White
so this is me just reading his head I
don't believe
that a man
you know there's the key the key
sentence a man not just in the
biologically male sense but he's not
just a man he's sort of a man's man
if you're a man's man
and you're the one organizing the
biggest charity event of all time
you don't take a cut
you don't you just don't
you just don't take a cut so I'll be
curious now if he does take a cut
I wouldn't criticize him
I wouldn't criticize him because it's a
business and he's it's all transparent
it's a legal transparent business he
runs it
he does a lot of work it would be a
tremendous amount of work
so given that his organization that he
would do a tremendous amount of work
yeah they they should get some money
but I'm going to predict that he won't
yeah I think he would just cover his
costs because it's a charity event
yeah which would be one of the smartest
business plays you know a non-financial
play I guess but in terms of uh
you know your your view of what his
his company does and who he is it'd be
pretty amazing so we'll just watch that
it's sort of a big question to me like
how does he play that because he's
played everything else pretty smart
so you expect him to do something smart
just wonder what it is
all right
um my favorite story of the day thank
you Fox News for bringing this to my
attention there's a handyman named flash
Shelton
okay that should be the story itself
there's a handyman named Flash
I I
it's just a perfect handyman's name
do you think you can get this done
quickly
well they don't call me flash for
nothing
I don't know I just love that name
anyway he uh he founded the United
handyman Association but he's also
working as a squatter removal
now this is the funniest thing and the
reason I think is so funny is that I can
so easily see myself doing this exact
thing if I were him you know not as me
but if I were him
the way he removes squatters
is he just walks in and he lives with
him
he just walks in the door and makes
himself at home brings in his stuff and
he just Moves In
and he's like how you doing you know I'm
I'm Flash
and then every time they come into the
living room he's sitting on their couch
he likes to leave their refrigerator
open oh sorry did I leave the
refrigerator open again
and then it gets better
he installs ring cameras in every room
of the house
because he he actually gets a he gets a
lease with the owner of the house before
he goes in
so he's the only legal resident
so as the only legal resident he just
puts up ring cameras
assume they try to take him down I don't
know but he's a handyman so if you're a
Heavenly Man you can probably like
install them so they're a little harder
to take down
and can you imagine him doing his work
you know his handyman work while they're
trying to sleep
I don't know I'm just putting up the
ring camera what time is it 3 A.M
yeah well I just have different hours
all right go back to bed
now how many of you how many of you put
yourself in the situation and said I
could I could do that
I could I could play that I could play
that seriously from beginning to end yep
I could do that
I could absolutely do that
but
but here's my uh racially uh charged
comment on that
am I wrong that this is a real white guy
thing to do
is not even a white woman thing to do
this is so white guy it's like the most
white guy thing I've ever seen in my
life am I right yeah can I hear it from
my older white guys this is such an
older well it's even older it's not even
a young white guy thing to do it's an
older white guy
it's a it's a dad
it's a dad joke it's basically one long
dad joke that serves a function of
getting rid of a squatter am I right
it's a dad joke it's a dad joke from
beginning to end and it gets rid of your
squatters
so if you ever need anybody to do a dad
joke
call an old white guy we love that
we love that best story I'd have
all right so congratulations to flash
I've said this before but I keep
thinking about it I keep seeing these
films of shoplifters and as you know it
would be illegal for the shop owner
to employ any violence so shop owners
can't do that
but could a shop owner have an
arrangement with somebody else who did
so for example could you hire some scary
people
to just hang around outside your store
but let's say they're not on salary so
they're not working for you officially
so you can't really give the mortars get
you because they don't work for you
officially
so whatever they do on the sidewalk well
that's not your problem that's just
something that happened on the sidewalk
from people who do not work for me but I
suppose you had to deal with them
we'll buy back the merchandise for ten
percent
yeah so if my merchandise leaves the
store and it was worth a hundred dollars
and let's just say hypothetically
somebody on the sidewalk who was not
employed by me
stole it back
now that seems so illegal stealing I'm
not in favor of it all but if somebody
did it
you know on their own
and then they came back in the store and
said yo hey I've got this product would
you pay me ten percent of the dollar to
get it back
I'd say well stranger a person who does
not work for me and is not on my payroll
at all
I I'm up for that here's here's 10.
now or or something like that or or you
can keep ten percent of the stuff you
steal back but when I when I saw the
story about the uh
the squatter remover guy
what I loved about the story is he used
the law against the law so law is that
squatters have all kinds of Rights
and if you're a citizen and the law is
not on your side you're helpless because
you can't physically remove them you'd
be arrested
so instead of instead of being thwarted
by the the law he did tell me the phrase
say it
you know where I'm going
to embrace and amplify Embrace and
amplify how do you destroy a rule or a
law
that is absurd
but you can't get it changed in ordinary
ways you use the law
you use it yourself that's what he did
because he was a squad or two in a way I
mean he was a legal squander because he
had a he had a lease but he just acted
like a squatter and nobody could remove
it
he just used the law
perfect
so it makes me wonder if there's some
Way Shop owners can use the law that
says apparently you can rob people with
impunity all day long
but the shop owners can't stop it if
you're the shop owner you can't stop a
crime so instead of stopping a crime you
become a criminal
now I don't think the store owner could
stand outside the store and stop
somebody and Rob it back because that
would look like the store owner stopping
but as long as there were some people
who were willing to do it for you and
they knew there was a market for the
goods once they stole them a 10 Market
would they not be willing to rob that
person as they left the store
Maybe
maybe now this isn't the best idea I've
ever had but I'll give you the the
concept the concept is is there a way to
use the law to thwart the law and I
don't know if there is exactly
put something in that neighborhood there
somehow humans have to stop the
criminals without themselves getting in
trouble
would you agree
would you agree that waiting for law
enforcement is now a stupid strategy I
mean waiting for them to improve their
game or waiting for them to show up
that's ridiculous so it has to be human
on human citizen on citizen and
I mean what I'd love to see is snipers
but you know I hate to see violence but
I wouldn't mind seeing snipers killing
uh
I just wouldn't mind it I wouldn't mind
seeing snipers killing shoplifters
because you wouldn't have to kill that
many you know once the word got around
probably 20 shoplifters and everybody
get the message
but I say the same thing about
um at the border
you know DeSantis says he's going to
stop the bad guys at the border with
using violence you know using the
military and I'm thinking at the border
you're going to wait for them to get on
our territory before you stop them
well why do we even train snipers we
have all this video where you can
actually see the coyote
it's obvious who the cartel employee is
they're the one with the guns and
they're standing they're standing in the
Stream directing people
are you telling me our military doesn't
have anybody who can take that guy out
from our side
because we should
yeah we should the sniper should be
taking them out on their side they
should be dropping them in the water
does anybody disagree
you don't think we should be sniper
snipering the makeup my own word you
don't think we should be snipering the
coyotes from our side of the Border
because you don't have to clean it up if
they die on the other side
if you if they die on our side if we get
all this paperwork if if a sniper takes
them out on their side there's no
paperwork it's a perfect solution
yeah
and I like I like videos of it too
like the military to take him out with
snipers and then I'd like lots of video
of the actual event
so you can see that the coyotes had
explode
yeah
we're Way Beyond playing nice
so I I believe I can say you should take
somebody's head off and I'm well within
the moral and ethical bounds of what I'm
doing here
so
let's use the law that we have all right
um have you noticed that
X
which used to be called Twitter
have you noticed it's the only place you
can get context about news
am I wrong about that
I only know of one place where I have a
chance of seeing both arguments now you
know I can get my own little Silo and
maybe sometimes Miss some arguments
but at least if the silo I'm in has an
argument that's just complete
there will at least be a community note
and it will almost certainly be some
democrat who comes over with a link to
the opposite point
you're not going to see that I'm seeing
them you're not going to see it on Fox
News you're not going to see it anywhere
I don't believe Instagram is showing you
both sides I don't know what Facebook
looks like because why would anybody use
Facebook
is still well no it's called meta
why why would anybody use meta for
anything
honestly I haven't even opened it
in so long I can't remember
do you remember threads
does anybody remember threads
for about a minute and a half it was a
competitor to to X
and now it's a thing you sort of vaguely
remember but you don't know anybody who
uses it
I don't know why anybody would own their
stock honestly
well why would anybody own a stock that
no young person uses and therefore you
can pretty much predict
the end of the company
the only thing they have going for them
well they do have Instagram that's right
they have Instagram and WhatsApp is
doing fine but the whole meta virtual
reality looks like it's going nowhere
and the Facebook you know the old
Facebook
classic
I don't know how that survives I just
don't understand it it's so useless
I guess it's just families with kids or
something
but you couldn't just put that on
Instagram Adam
so anyway
it's the only place with context and
here's an example of that
so there's a bunch of stories about
Justice Thomas who took a bunch of trips
including International trips he took
109 reported trips since 1991 and five
International trips and I guess the
story is that he has a rich friend who
brings them along on trips
now
I don't know why I thought about this
but the rich friend is a conservative
and Justice Thomas is a conservative and
the concern
is that Justice Thomas would be
influenced by his friend because he's
getting a lot of monetary benefit from
traveling with him
and then somebody else said and I don't
know why this wasn't the first thing
that came to my mind but it made me feel
stupid for not saying it first and
somebody said do you really think that
Justice Thomas needs to be bribed to
have conservative opinions
and I thought
okay that makes sense
he's literally unbribable
because his opinions have always been
the same you can see a whole history of
his opinion never changing basically and
it's always been on one side you could
predict it a year in advance
what would giving him money change what
was he gonna was he gonna become a
liberal because you didn't bribe him
enough
he's basically unbreibable by by his
existence
he might be the least bribable human
being
on the planet
because no matter how much money you
give him you can still predict a year in
advance what he would have voted
am I wrong
isn't he the most predictable vote on
the court
Am I Wrong well I'm I'm sure the
Liberals are as predictable
there's there's only what two swing
justices
are there three
or are there two swinging justices now
give me it's Roberts
or is it just Roberts
you think Kavanaugh in some cases Maybe
all right well
if he's not a swing voter how in the
world can you how
how could you possibly bribe somebody
who's always going to act the same no
matter what
now I would agree that I don't like the
look of it and I'll say the same thing
that I said about Biden and his
situation with foreign benefit
uh even if there are no laws broken if
you're a public servant you kind of have
to adhere to the appearance of
impropriety I feel like at that level
they have to manage to appearance what
do you say it's obviously is right and I
he didn't break any laws nobody is
accusing him of breaking a law
so he has every right to do it and I
support him in his right to do it as he
would support me there's your
reciprocity right there I'm pretty sure
that Justice Thomas would support me
if my freedom were taken away in some
unconstitutional way
so I'm going to support him I I guess I
guess I'll do the same as long as it's
legal apparently it's transparent
because we know the actual numbers
and he's traveling around with somebody
who just happens to agree with him on
everything
he has that right
I might not like it
it makes me a little uncomfortable makes
me a little uncomfortable but you know
what if I were doing something that made
Justice Thomas a little bit
uncomfortable
he's still backed me
as long as I was within the law right
so the fact that he makes me
uncomfortable
with that Association
not good enough I'm going to back him on
the law say the same as he would for me
I think
all right but here's the context that
Steve guests helpfully provided sure
Justice Thomas took 109 trips including
five International since 1991. I wonder
if anybody else acted that way well as
Steve guest points out RBG
um who was appointed in 1993 took 157
trips and 28 International uh Steve
Stefan or Stephen Breyer appointed in
1994 took 233 trips and 63 International
trips so apparently Justice Thomas is
not traveling nearly as much
as those two had
does that matter to you
I don't know I guess I'm similarly
uncomfortable
but I also believe that RBG and Stephen
Breyer probably were not influenced in
any way
super happy with it now the Biden
standard is different because we saw the
flow of money
the the fact that he may or may not have
done something illegal
is a little less important than the fact
that we could see the flow of money it's
one thing to go on a trip with a rich
person
and I think I've explained this before
the rich person needs other people to go
with them on trips or they don't have
fun right it's part of the fun other
people that you like being with you but
if the other people can't go on a luxury
vacation because they can't afford it
and you can afford for a million people
it doesn't really make sense for you not
to pay for their trip
because you're just you're basically
buying yourself a friend
so I don't mind that people buy
themselves friends to go on trips
it's just a fun trip I don't think that
any of these people change their votes
because of it
and it's very different to me that
somebody goes along on a private plane
that was going to go there anyway and
then guess on the yacht that was already
bought and already owned that's
different than somebody actually sending
cash
sending cash is a whole different animal
and so Biden's in a different uh
different conversation there
CNN is reporting that uh support for
funding Ukraine is starting to erode
uh
I wonder why
is anything happening over there that
would erode your
confidence and funding
could it be
learning about the Biden criminal
Enterprise
could it be that now we are not so sure
this is all about making America safer
because it doesn't look like it's making
America safer
doesn't look like it at all it looks
expensive
and here's a question that I ask you
would you support a war funding a war
that could be ended in a day with any
president except Joe Biden
now I don't know that that's true
but I can tell you it feels true
it feels true do you know why because
I'm pretty sure that a capable person
could end this in a day
now Trump's you know famously said that
first but I think Rama Swami could do it
I think DeSantis could do it I think RFK
JR could do it I think they all could
end it in a day I believe the only
person who can't
is the one that you have some questions
about his loyalty to the country versus
his checking account
and you have good reason to believe that
because he had a lot of trips to Ukraine
and they got a lot of money from Ukraine
that doesn't seem related
well it does seem related to policy
actually
all right so
um I don't know why
I think these two things should be
separated
I think support monetary support for
Ukraine
uh which might have a good argument or
there might be some argument for it that
I'm not aware of so let's just say
there's an argument for and against
supporting Ukraine here's what you have
to say is a no-go here's what's a no-go
for me
sending massive money to Ukraine
at the same time that Joe Biden is
president
you have to pick one
pick one
because the war has no credibility when
the only person who has gained
financially from the situation is in
charge
right you need somebody that you have
confidence does not have a monetary
interest
to be in that job and then you can ask
me for money
all right let me let me act this out for
you Scott would you like to give some
money to support Ukraine I'd be like you
know I feel sorry for the Ukrainian
people I don't like Putin
you know I I'm actually open to that I
might want to give some money to help
the ukrainians defend themselves
and then I'll say great give us some
money and we'll we'll run this through
the government through Joe Biden I go
what what oh you're saying the sum of my
money
will have in some way and directly be
controlled by the president or maybe you
know there's some
some way that they can make money off of
this
and then I say okay then I changed my
mind I still you know I love the
Ukrainian people I want them to do well
don't want Russia to take over the
country but I'm not going to give a
penny
to the guy who's being bribed by Ukraine
apparently
now I don't know that he is but I would
say it looks like it
so this is the this is one of those
appearance of conflict problems do I
know for sure that Joe Biden has ever
made the decision
that was because he was making money or
Hunter was making money that could also
benefit him do I know for sure
well you know that prosecutor situation
looks really sketchy doesn't it
but do you think you know anything for
sure about Ukraine
if you asked me to you know gun to my
head Scott do you think the the
prosecutor situation was legit
or do you think Biden was doing it for
you know Hunter's situation there I
would say probably for Hunter's
situation
it seems I'm going to say 60 40.
60 likely is exactly what you thought it
was that he was doing a favor for
barisma because Hunter was on the board
sixty percent chance but the 40 that
were that I'm completely wrong about
that and maybe he was just a bad guy who
needed to go or something
it seems unlikely now I'm going to
change it 80 20.
as I'm thinking about it I had to go to
80 20.
80 chances exactly what it looks like
that there was essentially bribery
because I can't think of any case where
the vice president of the United States
was dealing with anybody else's
prosecutor
I mean it's kind of an unusual situation
so that should be your big red flag
there it was like why is he even in that
business at all why is that even a
conversation
you know we're not doing it anywhere
else are we
except Pakistan apparently we removed
the head of Pakistan
it's a separate story
um
anyway so the bottom line is uh no money
for Ukraine as long as Biden's one in
charge of the money
um and I and maybe no money for Ukraine
no matter who but I'm not going to
listen to the argument as long as
Biden's in charge does that sound fair
you don't have to even listen to the
argument
you do not have to listen to why it's
good or bad to give money to Ukraine you
only have to know that the person who's
asking for it is clearly the only person
on the planet Earth who can't ask me for
that
there are eight billion people on earth
I'm not going to name them that would
take too long
but every one of those 8 billion
people every one of them
has more credibility asking for money
for Ukraine than that one
 Joe Biden he's the only
in the world that I wouldn't trust
when he says give me money for Ukraine
the only one there's nobody else not
even another Democrat
you could put uh you know Adam Schiff or
Eric swallowell in those jobs you know
my my least favorite Democrats and I
would still say okay you know make your
argument I'll listen to your argument
but I'm not going to listen to Joe
Biden's argument
he has completely sacrificed his right
to even ask for the money
I won't I won't hear from him anybody
else I'll listen yeah I might not give
you money but I'll listen to it
all right um so yeah I guess there's a
reason why that
support for Ukrainian fund and is eroded
that and the fact that the
counter-offensive is now non-existent
do you see a lot of reporting about that
old counter-offensive
no there's no counter offensive
I mean there might be some actions that
they call a counter offensive but
there's nothing happening that you know
no territory is changing hands
you know nobody is nobody's at the edge
of surrender
nothing
so why would you give money to that
why would you give money to that
I don't get it
um there's a technology
that's coming along pretty fast have you
seen the robot dogs I'm going to tie
this into Ukraine in a moment the robot
dogs apparently somebody has made a
little robot dog that will follow you
around and shake hands and roll over and
suffer and I thought to myself that
little robot dog
if you send a fleet to them across the
ground at dug in Russian positions
imagine how scary that would be imagine
being in a trench
and you look over you look over the
trench and you see coming over the hill
a stampede of robot dogs
that are suicide dogs
they just run toward the trench
recognize a human and they recognize
that the humans in whatever the GPS you
know attack zone is so they don't get
the wrong humans they just run at it
they see a trench they jump in the
trench boom
they basically be suicide dogs
would trench wealth do you think that
trench warfare would even work
if you had a a wave of robot dogs
because the robot dogs would be you know
blowing up the landmines as they go but
you have lots of them so the first wave
just takes out you know most of the
first wave gets blown up by landmines
and you know machine guns and stuff
let's say half of them get through
now there are only half as many machine
guns the next time they send the second
wave and all of them and a lot of the
mines have been exploded so so the first
wave of robot dogs
would just be to attract fire and
um you know blow up the landmines but by
the third or fourth wave of robot dogs I
would think you could clear all the
trenches
does it doesn't it seem like that's the
technology that Ukraine needs so they've
got lots of stuff in the air
but I think the stuff in the air has a
limited benefit against a trench
just guessing I mean you wouldn't want a
drone overhead of your trench either but
there are fewer drones in the air
you you would need like you know let's
say you had a
a thousand robot dogs
you don't think that would be enough to
punch through the front lines
I think a thousand robot exploding robot
dogs would be able to punch through the
Russian lines
so I think
a thousand robot dogs and Ukraine's back
in business but I think the war is over
it's just negotiation at this point
waiting for Trump
or ramaswamy we're waiting for something
all right Max boot you all know Max boot
is a sort of a Clinton loyalist Democrat
absurd figure
there there are some figures that are
more absurd than others because they've
you know made ridiculous claims in the
past
but I thought this was a fake I thought
somebody had mocked up an image and I
thought this can't possibly actually be
happening
but if you don't know this
Max boot went on CNN with a big chart
with the 18 reasons Trump might be a
Russian asset
that really happened
oh my God
and and I said to myself we're not dumb
enough to fall for that again are we and
then I thought
his bases
his base is absolutely dumb enough to to
believe that a revived Russia collusion
Israel
and when you you say to yourself well
we're not going to Get Fooled Again sure
we will I mean not not the people on the
political right they weren't fooled last
time but the people on the left
absolutely will be fooled yeah Max boot
has 18 reasons why Trump might be a
Russian asset you don't think that
convinced 20 of his base that's probably
true I'll bet it did
I'll bet it did and to me that the the
crossover line between parody and humor
I actually thought it might have been
from
um The Babylon bee a satire
because when I saw that that
in 2023 that Max boo who's you know a
ridiculous character to begin with that
he would actually go on TV with 18
reasons why Trump might might be a
rushed asset
as CNN aired that CNN allowed that on
the air
like that was a value
oh my God
I mean doesn't that seem more like a
joke than reality
that he that he would be you know
re-upping the Russia collusion thing the
most debunked hoax of all time and he
would just just shamelessly revive it
because it's another election
amazing I know that I hate to even talk
about this kind of news
because I don't have anything to say
about it except my head explodes when I
say it like well that's not much
commentary
Trump's been indicted for the Hawaii
wildfires all right that's not real
but could you tell
right
parody sounds I mean if you told me
there was a play where Trump could be
indicted for the Hawaii wildfires
I'd probably say uh
sounds real sounds real
well speaking of campaigning uh Vivek
ramaswamy he's on Russell Brand so that
just dropped and also he's answering
questions on Candace Owens
so
I'll say it again
it's another new cycle where Vivek owns
the news cycle
for the primary anyway
and you know Trump's perpetually in the
news no matter what the news is but
Vivek is just killing it
and I feel like there's an energy shift
that I think I think ifake has broken
the seal
I felt like he was under he was like in
a in a bubble that he couldn't get out
of because all the the so-called minor
candidates you know they're they're all
subsidiary to DeSantis and to Trump but
because DeSantis faltered
and it's always more fun to talk about
who might be in second place
as soon as second place was in play
um I think his his message started
gaining power but like I told you before
you can't have one candidate who's
absolutely massacring the news cycle day
after day with Innovative
well-executed quick
content that you know is right on the
news you can't do that every day for
like months at a time before all the
smart people notice
am I right it's it's really no he didn't
I saw the Ron Watkins exposing look into
that that was all all that's
been debunked and you should be ashamed
of yourself if you bought into it really
you should be ashamed of yourself you
use your tools of discernment on the
Vivek stuff
just just use everything I taught you
it'll it'll all be clear it's all
anyway it feels like Vivek is rising and
these broken antifa's little captured
news bubble what do you say
do you think he's reached like just this
week do you feel like he's reached
another level
so you said yeses
because it's all about how you feel
about it right you know forget the data
how you feel about it
I feel that's changed
um she just destroyed him on her podcast
did she
uh well I'm sure that that would be a
subjective opinion
right I have an update from Hawaii
it's not a good one
but I didn't think I could not tell you
now is not reported on the news
so I have I have a source
I won't mention the source just an
individual
who has strong connections there and
this is the part
um
so horrible I almost wasn't going to say
it but
uh somebody somebody knows well who's
reporting that he drove from
puamana to waikuli which I think is
basically through Lahaina
and he said that
there's cars with dead bodies all the
way
so I hope that's an exaggeration but I
don't think it is
I don't think it is
I think there's
five miles of dead bodies and cars so
I hate to say it might actually be true
so I think people are expecting the body
count to soar
because right now they just don't have
the services to find everybody and count
them and I mean it's just too much chaos
there
so it couldn't get much worse
so I don't know what the governments are
doing to help I assume people are
getting at least food and water
at least food and water
but you know the good news about Hawaii
is you don't need shelter it's it's the
only place I know of where you literally
don't need shelter you know you could
sleep outside under a palm tree if if
you had a blanket that's all you need
um
you need shade yeah you need shade so
you want to get under a tree probably
yeah it's just the worst thing
so anyway
keep your uh Good Vibes up for uh for
Maui
um
yeah
um I think I only told my my tsunami
story on the man cave
um well I'll do the the brief version so
I happen to visit Maui when the tsunami
this is a number of years ago uh on the
I landed on the day that the tsunami was
announced it was headed toward the
island
so I had to stay in the seventh floor of
the place we were staying this was with
my first wife and two kids and the
bottom of the building was evacuated
because they thought that the wave would
be at least that high
that's right
I was told to stay in a building on the
beach
as the uh as the tsunami came and they
weren't quite sure how big it would be
and then it goes completely dark
because it was going to come in the
middle of the night they can predict
because they know where it is and how
fast it's traveling but they don't know
how big it'll be because it depends on
the topography below the ocean you know
of where it hits
so I spent the night
waiting for a tsunami that was going to
hit my building downstairs and we were
on the seventh but the the fourth floor
and down were evacuated because it was
too dangerous
and I had to you know I did a lot of
like Engineering in my head I'm like all
right
this building isn't going to fall down
right
I'm still going to be able to get from
the seventh floor to the bottom floor
when this is over right
like I didn't know exactly what could
happen when a tsunami hits the bottom of
your building
so what did happen
was uh thankfully it was less than it
could have been so the tsunami would
probably took out the first floor
so I think the first floor got pretty
much wiped out but you know they
recovered quickly
but the next day
when you wake up the only food we had
was the like stuff that we didn't eat on
the plane you know some snacks we had in
our bags that's it and there wasn't any
place else to get
food
right family of four there was no place
to get food
and so we did what everybody was doing
we foraged
we actually had to go find if there was
a way to find food so we had you know
gas in the rental cars we drove around
and you know everything was closed and
it was just no food now we found a place
that had some pastries
like a coffee shop
and like we're like eating a little
pastries because we don't know the next
time we'll have food you know there's
like a line around the corner for just
the pastries so we had to just sit there
in line
so I had uh I would say my experience
and then by the by the end of the day
you know things were getting back to
normal so so my experience was you know
one percent
as bad as what's happening right now
just one percent it was just
inconvenient and I you know lost half a
pound for not eating for half a day
but
I can't even imagine what it would be
like to be on an island with no water
no phone
no electricity
and whatever you had your refrigerator
is probably starting to spoil
and that's a scary thing and you
don't even know where family members are
remember they don't have phones there
are people who don't know where members
of their family are even today
they don't know
it's it's bad Beyond even imagination
there all right so I don't want to bring
you down
but that's the real world real world
well there's there's a lot of places
that didn't burn down that don't have
electricity yeah
um
regarding Michigan election
well
let me say this about the election
Integrity I may have said this only also
on the man cave I'll say it publicly
um
for reasons I don't understand reality
does seem to follow a three-act most
amusing script it shouldn't there's no
reason I should but it seems to I don't
know why
and so Trump's third act would clearly
be January 6. meaning the thing that if
you're reviewing it as a movie you would
say well that's the end of him for sure
you lost the second term and not only
did he lose it he could end up in jail
and if he doesn't end up in jail at the
very least he couldn't possibly run for
president again
that's the third Act
he's leading in the polls
there's one thing he needs to guarantee
victory
and there's one thing he needs to make
this a proper movie
at the moment it's just a series of
things that happened
there's one thing he needs to turn it
into a movie
you know what that is right
just one thing
he needs to find verified proof or
somebody does that the election was in
fact rigged
now I do not have evidence personally
that that anything was rigged
I've not seen anything that I find
incredible all of the latest news it
could be true but I don't find it
credible and the reason I don't find it
credible is that nothing else was every
single thing you got excited about
turned out to be you know if
you thought you were looking for for a
fraud so maybe it's real you know maybe
Michigan is the real deal so whether or
not Michigan is the real deal so I'm not
going to make a judgment about anything
that's in the news at the moment I I
don't think the credibility is high of
any election story
any story I also don't think the
credibility is high when they say it was
fair
so I have about equal credibility for
the people who say it was unfair as the
people were sure it was fair neither of
those seem like
credible points just people don't know
it'd be more it's more fair to say we
don't know
um
but in the context of not knowing
I'm still going to predict
that because life takes a third a third
Act form for reasons I don't know
and I'm just going to observe it
the most likely outcome
Karma nature the simulation God every
single one of them wants Trump to find
the actual fraud that changed the
election result
every one of them every every
force of the world seems to be pushing
toward
finding out it was real
you know the the fraud
and again let me say clearly I'm not
aware of any evidence of that so it
would be kind of a shocking you know
Revelation if something like that ever
happened but it would be the perfect
movie
and that would follow a um and of course
that he would sweep into office and then
the end of the movie is him closing the
Border as we all want and ending the
Ukraine war and one month after he takes
office
everything except debt has been solved
I you know cried in the streets is over
and they basically they just solve
everything in one month which he could
do
it would be the greatest movie of all
time
am I wrong that if you if you didn't
live through it and let's say it's 20
years from now and you just saw the
movie of it
it would be the greatest movie ever
there would never be a better movie than
that you know it's it's like The Social
Network strong
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
all I wanted to say today thanks for
joining on YouTube and remember
imitation
is the only way anybody ever succeeded
imitation
if you remember that all of your future
difficult conversations will be easier
you don't need any racism to talk about
imitation it's available to everybody
um but it's not implemented by everybody
so
we'll see you tomorrow YouTube thanks
