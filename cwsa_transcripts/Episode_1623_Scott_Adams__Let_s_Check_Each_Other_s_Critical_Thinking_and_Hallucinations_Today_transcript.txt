good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that ever happened to
you
maybe not yesterday
yesterday didn't go so well
yesterday
and
was it the day before that i had my rant
about
a user on here named shelly
and somebody wrote that up and turned it
into a meme
and i was reading the meme so i got to
actually read back my actual words that
i
spit out and
thank you paul
that i spit out in apparently a moment
of
cathartic anger
and i'm reading it and i think the point
of it was to embarrass me
you know to
to show how awful i am and the bad words
i used and stuff and i was rereading my
own words and i thought
it came out better than i thought
so if you see that
go ahead and
go ahead and retweet it no there's no
prednisone
uh that was probably just a lack of
sleep
you know
if you'd like to take this up a notch
and i think you would you're gonna need
a little something called
the simultaneous set but all you need
for that is that copper mug or a glass a
tanker chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the the thing that makes
everything better and definitely the
first one of the day as far as you know
it's called the simultaneous step and it
goes like this
go
ah
well you trolls you can't get me today
so i went to my local mall
um
the other day
and i had a startling
discovery
you've probably noticed that the malls
are not very busy
you know no surprise
but
in my estimation 95 of all the business
the entire mall was doing
was the apple store
the apple store was shoulder to shoulder
people
and everything else was basically a
ghost town it looked like a lot of
stores probably had zero sales in you
know any given day looked like zero
so what do you do when 95 of all the
volume in your mall is just the apple
store
and i thought to myself
oh just make the whole mall an apple
store
go with what works
but i think a lot of these malls are
going to get turned into
cool little living places where there's
a you know like a center area that
people mingle and
all that sort of stuff
um
so let's start with some uh
cnn fake news there always is some
and one of their articles is on how uh
on joe rogan
um he was corrected by his guest on the
question of whether
young men have more myocarditis
from the vaccine itself
if you're under a certain age and male
or from getting the the coronavirus
and there was a disagreement there and
the
guest fact-checked joe rogan and so
cnn of course
uh
jumped all over this because for cnn i
don't know if you've noticed this
but has joe rogan become the new
trump as in the thing that you talk
about when there's nothing else to talk
about
or that all you really care about is
what he said about it
like everything is just a reaction to
joe rogan now
like everything used to be just a
reaction to trump
why can't we just have our own opinions
everything's got to be a reaction to
somebody who's
who's the target so it looks like cnn
and maybe some others are going to make
joe rogan the
the person we have to react to
on all the important stuff
and
so so the way cnn reports the story is
that joe rogan is embarrassed by his own
guest
showing him how he doesn't know anything
about
science or the facts or something like
that
and so that's the way cnn uh staged it
what did cnn leave out
do you think they left anything out of
the story
yeah
they left the part out of the story
where after it ran
people fact checked the guest
and found out that joe rogan was right
after all
or was he
but we do have two stories and they both
are backed by some kind of studies
i don't know i don't believe any data
anymore but
cnn leaves out the part
that's basically the important part
then it turns out that joe rogan was
correct
so they ran a story about joe rogan
being wrong
which was really a story about him being
correct
and his guess being wrong but it didn't
get resolved during the
the episode itself
and they used that story of joe rogan
being correct
that they turned into him being wrong
because it's cnn
as a lead-in to the story about
people trying to get him
censored on
spotify
i mean the
the boldness
of the narrative making and the
brainwashing is just it's just sort of
stunning no matter how many times you
see it it's still like
really are they doing that right in
front of us
nobody's even tried to hide it anymore
well i guess it's being hidden from
people who are not
let's say
sophisticated consumers of news
the other day i said something online
about if you didn't watch um fox news
you wouldn't know that the other
networks are hoaxing you fairly
regularly you wouldn't know about you
know several of the hoaxes and then
somebody said oh scott you're saying
that fox news has the truth
and the other ones don't have the truth
no
no i didn't say that
is that what you heard
did you hear me saying that fox news
gets it all right and the other ones get
it all wrong no it works the other way
too it's a reversible concept
the system is
watch the news on both sides
because they're both calling out you
know
mistakes intentional and unintentional
on both sides
now that doesn't mean you're still going
to know what's happening
but at least you'll see the other side
right if the if you're only watching one
side you really are confused and that
would work for both fox as well as cnn
if you're just watching one side but it
is also true that the people who are fox
news consumers
tend to also be exposed to the other
argument
so they tend to see it even if you know
they're
they're being a little bit more
persuaded by one side
anyway
um is it my imagination or have the
traditional news
sources become so discredited
that podcasters and again it's every
every story now has got to be about joe
rogan
right this is the roganization of the
news
because we used to have the trumpization
of the news and that was just going to
be the roganization of the news
apparently
but
doesn't it seem to you that the
traditional news is a little bit worried
that influence is going to podcasters
right
now
how influential is joe rogan at this
point compared to let's say the network
news
doesn't rogan have a much bigger
audience than any of the networks now
collectively they can gang up on them
like a little
pack of hyenas
so if there are enough of the little
ones they can gag up on them but somehow
he lapped the field both in
both an influence
as well as just size
and
this is the real new power struggle
now
i i've asked you this before but let me
ask you this here
how much influence do i have
as a podcast
on actual real world events
compared to let's say any particular
other
news entity
now you'll have different appearances
not much
now look at the differences of opinions
so i'm going to tell you something that
only a hypnotist can tell you
you ready for this
if you knew how much influence i really
have
i wouldn't have any
influence and a hypnotist
can simply hide in plain sight
i can actually tell you what i'm doing
and you still can't see it
because there's a cognitive blindness
that
most hypnotists and magicians
can create the way magic tricks work
is often just creating a cognitive
blindness so you're momentarily
distracted from or just don't pay
attention to where the trick is being
done
and it's the same thing happening right
now i could do it right in front of you
and you wouldn't be able to see it
so
somebody said one of the trolls said in
all caps why didn't you hypnotize your
stepson
my stepson died of an overdose
well
shelley
why didn't i hypnotize my stepson
could it be
because hypnosis doesn't work on
addicts it doesn't work
you can't really hypnotize somebody to
not be an addict because an addict is
not a
it's not really a
functioning
human in the way
other humans are
it's such a fundamental change in who
they are
that it's more like a zombie existence
i mean once you reach a certain point
so you really can't hypnotize a zombie
you could hypnotize a person but not a
zombie in case you wanted to know
all right so i expect that there will be
far more
attacks on joe rogan to reduce his
influence
and also on me
and you know the timpools and basically
anybody's got a larger
larger voice
so i've decided that uh we need to have
a telethon for what i call binary
disorder
binary disorder is what makes it hard
for most people to see
what tim poole is saying
or what joe rogan is saying
or what
i'm saying
because there are a number of people who
don't fit the extreme narratives
and if you don't fit the extreme
narratives
you you're just a confusing mess
in a cognitive way again it's like a
cognitive blindness or a cognitive
confusion
but i don't think it applies to everyone
for example i'm pretty sure that just
through a filtering uh
mechanism the people on the locals
platform
i'm pretty sure that they can handle
nuance outside of the two binaries
better than other people
partly through practice
right because we talk about it all the
time but partly because you have self
selection it's people who can handle it
or even willing to do it
so
i think we really need to
recognize that there's a thing
much like trump disorder syndrome was
real
how many of you would agree with that
would you agree with with me that tds
wasn't just a thing that you say on the
internet
it was real right
does anybody disagree with that at this
point
right yeah i think i think most of you
or all of you agree that that was real
but this binary disorder is just as real
have i convinced you yet i don't know if
i have
but is it not true and you can see it
all the time that if anybody doesn't fit
into a clean narrative
that you can't tell what the people are
just completely blind
to who they are and they force them into
one of the narratives and decide they're
an enemy or a friend
so
i think i'll do a telethon for binary
disorder we'll raise money to raise
awareness
here's a
random question
how many employees could be sick with
kovid
before it would really make a difference
to the economy
what's your number
put a number on so from zero to 100
percent
how many employees could be out at the
same time
before you really notice
i'm looking at some numbers coming in on
locals
you're all over the place from five
percent to eighty percent
twenty percent thirty percent over on
youtube
30.
well as as the dilbert guy
i feel qualified
to make a pronouncement on this
10 won't hurt anybody
10
not going to make a difference
i remember what i the first day i
learned this was when i worked in a
solid
cutting operation
at a resort it was my job to prepare uh
in bulk hundreds of salads so i'd be
chopping lettuce or vegetable or
whatever
and um
one of our
i think it was one of our five employees
quit
and the boss came to us and said here's
the deal
there were five of you i could hire
another person and there'll still be
five or the four of you
can just work harder and i'll give you
all arrays and we'll do the same amount
of work with four people you'll just
agree to work harder and i'll agree to
give you all a raise and all four of us
just looked at each other and said
yeah yeah
absolutely
and did she get a good deal
she did because the four who were left
were her better employees as it turned
out
and we just took it up ten percent
easily
we got more money
she got more productivity with one less
person to worry about
totally worked
now i saw this reproduce over and over
again in my corporate career
the boss would come in and say we're
gonna we have to cut 10 percent the
budget or the people just 10 of anything
and everybody would say no 10 we can't
we can't handle 10 percent
and then they'd cut 10 percent
didn't even notice
didn't even notice
so we're talking about uh covet
illnesses and that sort of two to
10 range
i feel like we'll be fine
now the problem is if that if you get a
cluster they hit something that's
critical which is pretty likely actually
isn't it
it's pretty likely you're going to have
a week
where something really important just
doesn't work at all because there were
just too many people in that one little
cluster
very likely but that would also be
temporary
right because that would resolve itself
in a week people would just come back to
work
so i think we're going to have some
really sloppy supply chain stuff
but it's not going to take us out right
yeah we're we're not going to be taken
out by the supply chain
you'll be fine
if i ran for the senate this would be my
one and only
promise
just one promise and that's it
i won't vote for any bill that's
mislabeled
so for example i wouldn't vote for a
voting rights bill
if
that didn't explain exactly what's
happening in the bill
and i wouldn't vote for a
infrastructure bill
that wasn't only infrastructure
and that's it
now basically i would vote against
everything right
realistically
now there might be a few i'd vote for
i'd say oh yeah that's exactly the name
for that thing
but i would just say
now the patriot act i think is a special
case
because nobody was really confused about
what that was you know so if nobody's
confused by it that's different
but if the name of it is by its
intention to confuse
as opposed to just persuasion
right it's one thing if you see somebody
selling something
and you know they're selling it and you
say oh they're just saying it's good
because they're selling it you're
completely aware of that but the public
is not completely aware that a voting
rights bill
might not be exactly what you think it
is or an infrastructure bill
might not be quite what you thought it
was
so i just vote against them all
and say
the minimum the minimum thing you have
to get right
is that you're explaining to the public
what the hell you're doing
if you can't do that don't give me
anything
like i'm i'm absolutely out on
everything
unless it's
unless it's
plainly stated
otherwise no
all right have you noticed that the word
coward is the new hitler
has anybody else noticed that
it seems like three years ago everything
and longer everything was hitler hitler
hitler because you know trump was
president
everything's hitler and now everything
especially under the pandemic
but also other topics all we're getting
is
cowards
somebody's a coward
so one of the stories today is
that
youtuber uh ethan klein
who's got a real big
very big uh podcast
and he said that he was gonna delete his
old interviews with jordan peterson
uh because blah blah it was a gateway to
the alt-right or something
now
um
i don't think jordan peterson is a
gateway to the all-right
and to me it even sounds just sort of
ridiculous
um
but you know it's not my opinion it's
not my show
it's his show i mean he could do what he
wants
but here but the post-millennium wrote
an article and said that
quote cowardly youtuber ethan klein
deletes interviews with jordan peterson
to appease woke audience
now he might been he might have been
appeasing
but was he cowardly
you know you don't think he
you don't think he believes what he's
doing
like why would we why would you read his
mind and decide he's cowardly
do you remember how much uh trouble bill
maher got into
when i think it was wasn't it 9 11
when george bush was saying that the
terrorists were cowardly
and bill maher was just calling
on it he was like they literally killed
themselves for their cause
you can hate them and call them any
other name you want but the one you
can't call them is cowardly i mean why
would you pick that and of all the
things
and of all the things that are true
that you can say about terrorists that
are you know insulting and bad
why cowardly that would be the weirdest
thing to call anybody
now that now of course i'm taking this
personally
because people are saying that my
decisions about
anything pandemic related are based on
fear
to which i say
i didn't process it that way
i mean i think i'm a better authority
of what was happening in my own brain
but i'm also a trade hypnotist and so i
i think nobody makes a rational decision
about any of this
so i don't think my decisions were
rational
but i don't know that any of them were
based on fear and i don't know how
anybody else could know
because did you read my mind
i mean it's the lowest level of analysis
is what i'm saying
basically
calling somebody hitler because you
don't agree with them
is not too much different from saying
they're cowardly because they made a
decision that you don't agree with that
looked like it was a popular decision
you know
sometimes the reason that the popular
decisions are popular
because a lot of people are on that side
even if you don't like it
right
so i would say
i guess this is more of a
writing tip than it is an opinion
yeah let me frame it this way this is a
writing tip not an opinion
if you're going to write this somebody
else's cowardly
just know that it looks like you didn't
do the work
like it like you didn't you didn't put
enough
thought into it
can i say that
it's sort of like a comedian who who
curses a lot
it can be pretty funny
but i don't respect it because it's too
easy
calling somebody hitler
let's just
why do we have to see that again
just stop people calling people cowards
it's just
there's no insight there
well right on schedule when everybody
was
saying about jim not everybody but when
the write was saying that january 6
hadn't produced any insurrection charges
somebody got charged with sedition
now i don't know anything about the case
but do you think it's a coincidence that
just when the narrative required
somebody to be charged with
something closer to insurrection
that we get a sedition charge
and let me ask you this how likely is
that whoever got charged and again i
don't know anything about the case
and i'm still going to say this
confidently
i don't think there'll be a conviction
do you
i don't even know anything about the
charge
it's just a little bit too on the nose
if you know what i mean
timing's a little bit too perfect
it looks like they need to charge
somebody
so that the charge itself becomes the
story and it
gets rid of that nobody's been charged
for something that sounds like
insurrection problem
i swear to god this does not look like
anything like justice
it could be
i mean it could be a coincidence
and it could be that somebody did
something actually that bad
but i so don't believe it we don't have
a system where you can believe that
anymore
the the benefit of a doubt
is so removed now from our government
and i'll say it again
if there's any doubt whether that's
sketchy you have to assume it's sketchy
because the government needs to prove to
you
that they're not the public
it's not for you to prove it they have
to prove to you
that they're not screwing you for
political reasons and i don't feel i
don't feel i got that case
i don't feel that whoever got the
sedition charge
you better bring the goods
i don't think they will
and that i think somebody's life will be
destroyed for their narrative
if i had to guess that's what it looks
like it's happening
do you trust anybody who says i've got a
big old list of experts who are all on
my side
here's my list of people who signed a
document look at all these experts on my
side
does that ever persuade you
it's becoming one of the least
persuasive ways to persuade
um you know some of you
got off that ship with climate change
because you said i'm not sure all these
people are saying this and then of
course there's you know another list on
the other side and people say but ah
well look at the people on that list
where everybody should have lost it
the the belief in the list persuasion is
when you heard that 17 intelligence
agencies agreed on whatever the hell it
was
do you remember that
17 intelligence agencies
do you remember who was the first person
in the world
to tell you what that really meant
it was the creator of the dilbert comic
strip
let me tell you what 17 intelligence
agencies agree always means
it means one of them did the work
and the other 16 said
we don't want any trouble yeah what you
said that looks good to us
and that one who did the work
it wasn't the whole agency that did the
work
it would be you know maybe a team of
five
who did the work
but the team of five
wouldn't be equally
powerful
and indeed were appointed by
one person
who got to pick who was in the team
which already tells you what the
decision is going to be
so if you ever see
17 intelligence agencies agree
your automatic thought process should be
one person decided this
and that's exactly what it was
or something close to it it was pretty
much one person
and they and you were sold on
all these people all right here are two
new new examples
uh there are 270 doctors apparently who
want joe rogan censored on spotify
or some kind of treatment that would
give you access to the alternative
argument i guess so they're a little bit
open on how to do that which is good at
least that part is good
how much should we trust 270 doctors
well dr malone has his own list of
experts
now i guess the 270 weren't even doctors
were they is that the story
i think some of them weren't even
doctors
but uh
or a lot of them
but dr malone who is the subject of the
controversy because he was on rogan's
podcast he has 16 000 doctors who agree
with him
he's got sixteen thousand so who's
better the two hundred seventy i want
joe rogan censored or at least
show the other side better
or the sixteen thousand doctors who
agree with dr malone that things were
pretty good the way the way it worked
out
well
you probably should know that dr malone
happens to be the head of the
organization
within which the sixteen thousand
doctors are
so basically the head of the
organization got his organization to
agree with him
i i don't know how hard that was but i'm
not sure it gives it any credibility
so don't believe any list persuasion
one of the one of the greatest things
that dr malone is doing right now and
i i mean this seriously
it is completely on a left field that
any of this is happening that he's the
one who's talking about the mass
formation and psychosis
and and making that a a well-known thing
now in some senses it's what i've been
talking about without using those words
or you know quite that approach
for a long time
but because he was on you know joe rogan
and it was tied to the pandemic
he gets he's getting a lot of
a lot of traction on this
and i think is really going to change
how we think of things like in the
future not just on these topics but
the future but still i can't figure out
what's different about it because the
the key to it seems to be
that if the people in charge scare you
enough they can get you to do anything
did you not know that already
how many of you didn't know that if the
people in charge scare you enough
they can get you to do absolutely
anything
i thought we all knew that so i don't
think there's absolutely anything being
added by this whole
mass formation thing there's nothing
it's absolutely empty
and yet it's one of the greatest things
ever
because people don't think it's empty
what they think is that they should pay
more attention to how
mass perceptions are being managed
and that
my friends
is one of the most important things
that's ever been done
in the history of humanity
dr malone
i don't know if it's how much is an
accident or chance or
skill i don't know what it is
but he has
in many ways single-handedly
reframed
reality
for a lot of people now didn't reframe
it for me because that this is where i
always have been at least since i
learned this stuff
but for a lot of people they are
learning for the first time
that their opinions are not real
think about that
he he's basically the person who took
the
um let's say the academic ideas of how
we're all persuaded and sort of through
the joe rogan experience
and it had really not that much to do
with his main point of expertise
but became but because he got so much
attention and was associated with it and
he's credible in other ways he brought
this completely unexpected thing into
the consciousness of the people
and in my opinion
this is the most important
mental switch
that humankind has had since
maybe understanding that the scientific
process was important
something like that i mean this is
enormous
and i don't think you quite realize it
yet
how much this this is going to seep into
our
full understanding of who we are as
human beings in the same way that
in the same way that trump changed
really everything about how we
understand fake news and reality itself
and
uh persuasion
that the importance of even having the
facts right he changed all of that
and it looks like
malone is
is now like putting the frosting on that
cake if you know what i mean it's like
he's completing
he's completing the baking
that you could you could say uh trump it
was half baked
but i mean he definitely got the cake
started
anyway um
in my opinion
um
well we'll get to that in a second
i i asked a bunch of people who think
that elites are destroying the country
um through this the prosecutors that
soros is
uh
is promoting or funding
to the vaccinations to the stealing our
privacy to the open borders so there's a
whole bunch of amorphous things and i
want to give you a little test in
cognitive dissonance so here's the test
one of the tells i tell you all the time
is if a lot of people have the same
opinion
but they all have a different reason for
it what does that mean
if a lot of people have exactly the same
opinion
but they all have completely different
reasons for how they got there
it means yeah it's cognitive dissonance
because if a lot of people have the same
opinion but maybe they're just two or
three reasons for how they got there
that might just be their opinion
but if they're if the opinions are just
crazy and it's all over the board
there's
probably telling you something
so i was asking the questions then uh on
twitter
and
i asked why does anybody want to do what
we imagine is happening and here are the
types of answers i got
um
i got that
let's see the central banks are mutating
into global dictatorship which was
always its end game
um i got that
um
the big money likes big volatility
i liked uh
when you shake the box it gives the
people on top the ability to consolidate
more power
um i gotta follow the money that didn't
help me as much as you think
uh they want to fundamentally transform
the fabric of society
from western capitalism to
status socialism
why they want to do that
and then um
they may want they may want to be doing
these things
because they believe they're doing good
and that they can reshape american
society and create a you know a global
great world
um
they've been trying to remake they
whoever they is have been trying to
remake society since the french
revolution
so here's my problem with all of these
first of all they're
they seem to be all over the board
number one
are the elites not competing with each
other
is everybody like trying to make soros
the king
the other billionaires want that you
think
that doesn't make sense
so who exactly are the elite
is it the bankers
so the first question you have to ask
yourself is
in this
conspiracy
who do they think is going to be on top
and why
here's the other problem
if you understand economics
you do not believe that shaking the box
sort of randomly anyway
is going to be good for you
anybody who is smart enough to become
a soros-like billionaire you'd have to
understand how things work
and one of the things that one of the
ways that things work is the the way you
get the richest is with the most
capitalism
there is no exception to that
if they want to have more richness and
power
and they're already billionaires and you
know captains of whatever they're doing
more capitalism is the way to get more
power
there's nobody who's going to say i made
my billions with capitalism and now to
double my power i'm going to destroy law
and order open the borders and go to
socialism
nobody who's smart enough to be an elite
would have that opinion
and if only one did
that wouldn't be enough because there's
got to be some kind of
conspiracy going on here
so
i'm completely confused
yeah you're davos i mean people are just
throwing out random words at me davos
central banks
none of it connects
because if you can tell me the person
i'll tell you why it can't be that
person
somebody says control
let's take that
so let's say they have enough money
but what they want is control and maybe
more money can get you more control but
power right
who
who
oh sorrows
are you saying that
uh lots of the elites are helping soros
because they want him to be in power
the other elites
or are they competing
and do all the elites think they'll be
the winners if they destroy the system
so do you think that when you get to
become an elite billionaire you suddenly
believe that your best interest is to
destroy the system that that put you in
that position
uh some others say that the volatility
is good
so but but do you see the problem that
people have different opinions in the
rothschilds
okay we'll throw in the raw rothschilds
there too
the raw shells are bankers
do you know what bankers don't want
socialism
there's no banker who wants socialism i
mean if you're trying to get power
because what got them their power is
what they'd want more of
right when people get power they don't
become more reckless they usually become
more conservative
so i don't know what's going on honestly
so i don't i
i don't have a competing hypothesis
to say you're wrong
so i'm not going to say any of you are
wrong
i'm saying that something's going on
here i don't know what it is but to me
it doesn't look like any kind of
conspiracy of the kind that you think it
is and if you did come up with a name
and how that person actually could
imagine it would benefit them to get
power
in any way
all right
could be
um
maybe they're going for the
materialistic
utopian
uh one of the ideas somebody said is
it's like the knockout game and that the
billionaires are just
trying to
knock things out because they can
or or sometimes people just like to see
things burn these are the actual answers
i got to this
or and some also some people are
thinking that we need to depopulate
i'll bet there are no
billionaires who think we need to
depopulate
i'll bet there are zero
do you know why
because you can't become a billion i
know you can say gates you don't get to
become a bill gates billionaire unless
you understand
that more people is better for the
economy
no bill gates was talking about birth
rates
birth rates are not depopulation
controlling the birth rate
you could argue the good or bad of that
but he doesn't need he doesn't need
fewer people total
that that's not a thing
i'm sure of it
all right
um
biden had a bad week so bad that uh
so bad that courtney holland joked that
it was a good week for jimmy carter
because jimmy carter is no longer the
the worst president in the world
and here's my question about biden do
you think that anybody who supported
biden regrets it
yeah i just sent out a message to
you know one of one of the people i
talked to a lot about before the
election
who was quite sure that biden would be a
real solid choice and that trump would
be a disaster
and i just wonder
has anybody's mind changed
because i'll bet not
right
i'll bet there's still some way to
justify that everything's fine
you know i'm going to probably surprise
you a little bit
that
i don't think the biden administration
is as much a disaster as you do i mean
there's some real notable failures but
it's hard to imagine that they wouldn't
have happened with a different president
right the the things he's not fixing
are the things that are kind of not
fixable
the the exceptions would be there's
something with the rapid testing that's
really wrong
but it was wrong under trump as well
it was just as wrong in the trump oh the
border would be yeah that okay i'll give
you the border
yeah the border would be a clear example
of a just a mistake
afghanistan
is interesting because you have to
assume that there was a better way to do
it
and we're all geniuses because we didn't
have to do it right
now it does seem like there was a better
way to do it i'll give you i'll give you
afghanistan at least in the political
context that would be judged an
unambiguous mistake
even if you don't really have something
to compare it to in a scientific sense
politically that's unambiguously a
mistake
yeah i but i think the
um
the other stuff will get worked out yeah
jan okay you're you're talking me into
it
uh i'm watching all the counter
arguments uh running by you know the
the pipeline the energy
the the january 6 political prisoners
the inflation
i think the only difference is i have
lower expectations of what a different
president would have done
so
there's no
there's
there's no argument there's no argument
that biden is the bad can we
agree on that
yeah mandates mandates
there's no argument that biden is just
doing a bad job i'm just saying that you
don't really know that the whoever else
the other person
is would have done a better job you just
don't know
it it's pretty funny when i see the list
go by because
because it is really
he really he is the worst president
we've ever had
i'm trying not to experience any shot in
freud has anybody had this uh experience
yet
so shot and freud is when you feel good
because
somebody else feels bad
and
when trump lost and biden won
that felt bad to a lot of you who are
probably trump supporters if you're
watching this
and
and i have to admit
um
you know i probably felt bad
and then i wanted to be right right we
all we all want to feel right we want to
be vindicated in the end and when you
see biden hitting like
your record low
approvals and even his own team is
trying to try to take him out so that he
doesn't run again he's that bad he's so
bad his own side has tried to take him
out
and when you see it
if you were a trump supporter
i'm just going to ask you this question
confidentially
just between us
did it make you feel a little good
to see biden labeled as the worst
president of all time
just a little bit
just a little bit
come on
because you know
the same biden labeled the worst
president of all time and with
as you just noted
with reasons
it's not even like it's just like
emotional stuff
it's with reasons
good reasons
lots of examples
you tell me that doesn't make you feel
good because you're vindicated
yeah
it
but
but on the other hand
i don't feel good about feeling good you
know what i mean
because schadenfreude is sort of the
worst of us
that's that's
that's human beings showing their worst
personality trait if you're feeling good
about somebody else feeling bad
don't feel proud of it
but it's there you know i sometimes i
can't stop smiling about it but i don't
feel good about it if you know what i
mean
all right
um
so i think there's uh more pressure for
the public
on ending things on february 1 in terms
of the mandates and here i think is
coming out in this new cdc
mask
guidance
so
can we before i talk about we all agree
that we all want to get rid of the masks
if
if and it's a big if
if they ever made a difference
they don't now
right
we're all on the same page right
if we can
start there
then i could talk about some things that
are fun and we don't have to fight about
whether masks work okay
so because i'm not in that argument at
all it doesn't matter if they work
can we agree it doesn't matter if they
work
like that argument doesn't have anything
to do with anything
okay
we all want them to go away but so the
cdc said this
and watch the how they chose the words
so the new guidance is to wear the most
protective mask you can
that quote fits well
and that you will wear consistently
what does that sound like
that you can wear consistently and fits
well that you can wear consistently
i feel like they're giving up
right
doesn't this feel like the beginning of
the
the transfer of control
am i reading too much into it there
there is the foreshadowing of the
transfer of control
from you better do this
to
consider this
right it's more about use your judgment
now
are you seeing it or am i getting too
optimistic
because i think i think they can read
the room
and they're starting to um just as the
cdc
would conform to political pressure
they will conform also to public
pressure so i feel like at this point
we're actually driving the cdc
not the other way around
so february 1st start to look pretty
good especially with the shortage of
your rapid tests
you know if the mass don't make much
difference with omicron
we haven't seen any impact in the news
et cetera
all right now
i i'm gonna
i'm gonna do a few other things and then
i'm gonna save something for the end
because some of you will bail out for
that
now i'm going to do this now
if we're all on the same page that masks
don't seem useful at this point in the
pandemic if they ever did and that's a
whole different question
can we agree that masks are
emotional
emotional like people really have
opinions about masks
and that when things are really
emotional
that's when you get cognitive dissonance
in both ways
and i would like to uh confess
what i believe is behind my own
decisions about masks okay
now i've never been in favor of mask
mandates you all know that right i've
never been in favor of mass mandates
but i've worn them
you know at various times and i feel as
though my own opinion is shaped entirely
by
non-rational forces
and then i rationalize it after the fact
do you think you do that
how many of you think your own decision
on mass is really if you if you're being
honest with yourself
is completely emotional
and then you rationalize it after the
fact
anybody do that
now i've been i've been accused of using
fear
as my rationalization and i've denied
that
in the sense that i don't internally i
don't think of it that way but i do have
some irrational
feelings about mass and i want to share
them with you number one
in my special situation as
a celebrity
i kind of like the anonymity
i kind of liked it i liked being able to
go to a store and there was less chance
i'd be recognized especially since i do
this now
now should that
influence my decision it shouldn't
right because that's like personal and
it's
more emotional doesn't really have an
impact on my health
so that shouldn't affect me but i bet it
does you want to hear another one
i kind of like
that in the grocery store the other
customers are not breathing on my food
especially the vegetables
should that influence my decision on
masks hell no
hell no it wouldn't be a rational reason
it's an irrational reason
do i like it when i go in the restaurant
and they let me take my mask off
immediately so i can enjoy my time
but the server wears a mask as they're
talking directly above my food
i kind of like the server being in a
mask
so that i don't have to think about the
spray from their talking
falling on my food
is that does that ever hurt me probably
not
is it rational probably not because
you're always filled with people's spray
and food and chip it's an irrational
thought
so i do have a whole bunch of irrational
feelings about masks
that probably
are influencing what i've decided is my
rational decision about them would you
agree
we'll talk about me only you don't have
to talk about yourself yet would you
agree that i
have probably
made a masked opinion based on my
irrational forces and then rationalize
it after the fact how many of you would
agree that to be true
a lot of you right
now i don't know that that's true
but it would conform to my own opinion
of how things work
right so the weird thing is i can both
be
i can have a firm opinion
that i'm not being rational
at the same time i don't know what's
wrong with my thinking
you might
but i wouldn't be able to see it
somebody says now do vaccines we'll get
to that
so
we could have a really fun discussion in
the next moment if you can release on
the fact that i'm telling you i'm right
and you're wrong can you do that
can i is that fair can you release on
the fact
that i'm arrogantly telling you i'm
right and you're wrong because that's
not my world view my world view is we're
all making irrational decisions and
we're all rationalizing after the fact
it'll just make it easier to do what i'm
going to do because i wanted to do a
little test on twitter the other day to
see if i could uh
i've done this before you know trigger
cognitive dissonance intentionally
now the way you would trigger it
intentionally is you get somebody to say
something out loud or in public
that is inconsistent
if you force somebody to say something
that's inconsistent with their own
opinion
they will be triggered into cognitive
dissonance and you'll you'll see all the
signals
now and i've taught you most of the
signals we'll go over them again so i
asked a few questions that were designed
to trigger cognitive dissonance
the topic is masks but i don't care
about masks
and i don't feel that my opinion on them
should
influence you because mine is probably
irrational right
man drowning
you are so lost
some of you are so lost
all right
here's uh here are some questions that i
asked and the answers
um
if you didn't have any no keep in mind
these questions are not meant to be
like really scientific polls and and
they are meant to be coercive right so
when you say that question isn't fair i
know that
i know that
these are not fair questions
but i asked this on twitter to see what
kind of reactions i would get i said if
you didn't have any credible data to
guide you
your decision which of these risks seems
larger to you
so you don't know anything else except
what i'm going to tell you now so don't
use anything about the pandemic
only what i'm going to tell you now
which do you think is more dangerous
being exposed
to a military-grade bio-weapon
or being exposed in other words taking a
vaccination
that got fast-tracked
i'm getting to get rid of my mascot here
because he's just saying the same thing
you are now hidden
all right so which do you think
toss-up
it would be a toss-up
because these are two things you don't
know anything about
you don't know if the military bioweapon
was complete
you don't know if it was meant to
kill people like you
you don't know
but the vaccination itself also has a
bunch of unknowns
but what did people say
so
oh and then i uh
the most dangerous would be the
vaccination plus the bioweapon
so
now i'm not saying that necessarily the
uh kovid is a bioweapon right so i'm not
saying that
i'm saying
if you believed it was
you know which one do you think was more
dangerous
um and i would say i don't know
but i would be definitely scared of a
bioweapon
that was actually designed
to be unnatural i think some people
think the virus is natural
and the vaccine is unnatural
but i think one of them was designed to
kill you and one was designed to save
you
would you rather take would you rather
be exposed to something that was
designed to kill you
or something that was designed to save
you
now again you don't know anything about
either one of these
you don't know if they were designed
correctly
so if you don't know if the bio weapon
actually would kill you
likewise you don't know if the vaccine
that was designed to protect you
might make it worse
you don't know you have no other
information
because we don't know in the long run
what the coronavirus will do to you
right
because it hasn't been in the long run
and you don't know what the vaccines
will do to you in the long run
because it hasn't been in the long run
so but people had strong opinions on it
despite having zero information
personally i would have been influenced
by the purpose of them
i would be more afraid of something that
was designed to kill me than something
that was designed to save me even
knowing that both of them could have
been designed imperfectly
but i would have no no data to back that
that's just like a feeling all right
here's another one
um
which would you prefer
if you had two choices and only two
choices
would you rather have somebody who is
infected with covid
breathe directly into your face
or to breathe
out the size of a mask
go
i ask you the same question
would you prefer that people breathe
covered directly into your face
or out the sides and tops of the masks
so a lot of people
51 said they would prefer to have that
covens
sprayed directly into their face and not
out to fit down to the sides
does that sound like people are making a
decision
completely rationally
does it
so here's what i decided about why
people have different opinions on masks
i'll bet you haven't heard this frame
before
everybody looks at everything through
their own experience right
scientists scientists are saying how big
are the holes how big is the virus
the
the non-scientists are just saying
you know do do what the officials tell
you
so people are you know all over the
place but i feel like i always looked at
mass with an engineering perspective
did anybody else do that i know there
are a lot of technical people who watch
this but those of you are engineers
and only for those of you are engineers
i'm gonna i'm gonna run by the this
argument
and again if you're just joining us we
don't care about masks
we all want them to go away right away
right there's no argument of four
against them we're only we're only
talking about cognitive dissonance
here's the engineering argument
if we know that the higher the viral
load the worse
then it should be obvious to anybody
with an engineering sense
that blowing the virus directly into
somebody's face without a face mask
would give them more viral load
there's no there's no engineer that
would disagree so far
in the short run
talking about the short run but let's go
to the long run
where you're talking in the same room
for a long time
and now the level of covet is building
up in the room
now just for the engineers
if you wait long enough is it the same
level of risk
as if the entire time the covid was
going directly into the face
is at the same level of risk
once you've reached the saturation point
i'm seeing lots of yeses
now that's not fair
i need to see you're an engineer
and then yes
so the only answer i want to hear is
i'm an engineer
and then yes or i'm an engineer and then
no and everybody else everybody else
just goes silent for a moment we only
want to talk to the engineers just for a
moment
all right
uh engineer depends on the half-life of
the virus thank you
i mean that's only one variable it's not
the only variable
engineer says yes engineer says no
engineer says
yes equilibrium
engineer too many variables thank you
too many variables that's a good answer
i'm going to give you my engineering
take on this in a moment engineer yes
without disbursement all right here's
what i think is the correct answer
a hundred percent of the virus blown
into somebody's face
versus the same amount of virus remember
it's the same person talking the whole
time
so the total amount of virus is either
going to be
directly in the face
before it goes in the room
or it's going to be more in the room
before some one percent of it goes into
your face which would be
which of those would infect you well if
you believe that any exposure infects
you
then 100 of the people get infected in
all the situations
would you agree
would you agree with that
that if you could be if the only thing
you're talking about is can you be
infected
they'd be kind of similar in the long
run
does everybody agree not the same but
they'd be closer to similar
if if any little bit exposure like
omicron right if it's omicron and you
ruin the room i think you got it right
but
what about the viral load
do you think you'd get the same viral
load if you were occupying your head is
occupying
one percent of the room i mean far less
than one percent but if your head is
occupying one percent of the room
the whole time you're in there but the
virus is spread out in the whole room
versus the plume going directly into
your face the entire time
let me ask the question again
if viral load matters
not whether you get infected or yes or
no that's not the question we'll all
take a yes on that
if you wait long enough with omicron you
all get infected we'll take a yes
uninfected but if viral load matters and
the experts say it does which one gives
you more viral load go engineers you
have to say you're an engineer
and then tell me which one
which one gives you more viral load
uh
engineer in your face engineer in your
face
engineer in your face engineer direct
engineer
uh in your face okay so i think i made
my case
when you talk to engineers or people who
just think like engineers
you almost always can get the same
answer
right i mean correct me on that
engineers
right
so
for everybody who said that face masks
don't work because scientists
said you know the mask does this and the
n95s are better that's that's sort of
the scientist frame on things
the engineers and i always i tend to
take more of an engineering frame
because i spend so much time in that
world i'm not an engineer but i i just
get sort of infected by that frame
to me
the face mask thing was never
even ambiguous
to me having stuff sprayed to your face
has got to be worse now let me let me
end with a joke that's unfair
may i end with an unfair joke because
analogies are always unfair right
but sometimes they're fun
so many people told me that it didn't
matter if you were wearing a face mask
because it didn't matter if you're
spraying the coven directly into my face
or just spraying it into the room i was
just gonna be the same same result
i realized that before i when i was
cleaning a stain on my countertop
i would take the the cleaner and i would
spray like a concentrated spray right on
the stain
and then i'd like clean it and that
would help me get like the right amount
of the cleaner
right onto the stain but now that i've
learned more about uh how covid works
now i just sort of walk around the room
and
i just spray the air a little bit
and then i clean the stain
all right
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
was one i wanted to talk about and by
the way i'm completely aware that the
people on my twitter my twitter poll who
said that they would prefer a cove and
be sprayed directly in their mouth i
understand that they were making a
different set of assumptions
such as
you already are vaccinated or you
already were infected or you think it's
you think it's just the coup or
you'd rather have your freedom
i i get i get that this was not a real
poll there was no science in it okay
so we all understand that
but
i think it was fun
if you can release on the fact that i'm
sure i don't know the right answer about
any of this because i rationalize
my stuff after the fact just like you do
but isn't it fun
am i the only one who enjoys
like seeing if the cognitive dissonance
can be triggered and then
then just do something with it
the people on locals are more likely to
say it's fun
more fun than
joe biden
then somebody said do the same thing
with vaccines
so i've told you that um uh i'm not
gonna get boosted
and uh uh andre's back house challenged
me on that uh privately
and so are you sure about that because
he showed me a
study that said that people were boosted
you know had a good outcome
to which i say i don't think you can
test the long run until
the long run is here right
how could you possibly know that a
booster
is going to uh not
increase your chance of whatever in the
long run you know my understanding from
dr malone
is that there could be long term i don't
know clots or whatever so doesn't it
make sense that
if two shots
can largely plus the omicron it's two
shots plus being in the in the omicron
world
if that basically reduces my risk of
dying to zero and it does
i mean personally just just me
personally why would i add the extra
risk of a booster
something that couldn't have been tested
in the future when i've already
decreased my risk to zero
what would be the point of that
so
um and and then i also am influenced by
history every time you hear somebody say
the reason my product didn't work
is because you didn't use enough of it
does a little bell go off a little alarm
that goes warning
warning
that sounds a lot like oxy oxycontin
which was exactly what the oxy people
said
they said oh
uh it's not getting rid of your pain all
night like we promised and it was the
main reason you bought it
try doubling it oh that didn't work
i've got an idea for you
why don't you double it again
that didn't work
here's some out of the box thinking
why don't we double that again that
literally happened at least according to
the dopesick
um movie about it
assuming that was accurate that's
actually what happened
the the other thing i hear is that
people are getting like sick uh for
how many of you have had this thought
that the people who uh
the people who got vaccinations
if you added the total number of sick
days
of the people who got vaccinated because
you know you missed that like day of
work quite often
would it be more or less days than the
total number of sick days from people
who are actually infected with covent
that's a that's a serious question i
don't know the answer to that do you
because
if you vaccinated everybody
and then multiplied everybody by an
average of one day lost work or maybe
half day if you took the average
don't you get to more lost days of
productivity than
all of the retired people who were 85
and died of covet
i feel like the vaccination should have
if everything we know about it is true
and i would you know
be taking the numbers that even the
pro-vaccination people would give you
which is yeah there's a good chance
you're going to miss a day of work
i mean that was what they promised us
right
they promised us there's a good day
there's a good chance you're gonna miss
a day at work
i mean that was overt right that there's
nothing between the lines they said that
if you add all that up is it more or
less than what we missed
with covet i know i mean most of the
people i hear of like joe rogan just
said he had one bad day with kovac
he had actual cove and he had one bad
day
now i don't know how bad it might have
been the worst day i can't imagine it
was just one bad day
maybe one one really bad day i guess
all right
that is all i've got for now i don't
know if i forgot any topics
but
my technology is working today
um
linguistic kill shot oh this is a good
one
uh
linguistic kill shot go tell a liberal
quote go get your fourth trump shot
and mike job
that's not fair
i i don't think it's fair for you to
persuade people on vaccinations and i
don't think it's fair for me to do it
which is why
i always tell you i'm not doing it even
though apparently some people hear it
the other way
but
this was no doubt about it the best
experience any of us have ever had
it's called coffee with scott adams the
best thing that's ever happened to you
and it'll happen tomorrow
and it'll be even better
all right bye for now
