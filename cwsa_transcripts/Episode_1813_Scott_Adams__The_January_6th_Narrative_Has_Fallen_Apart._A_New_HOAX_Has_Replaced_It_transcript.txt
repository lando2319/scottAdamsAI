everybody
welcome
to the highlight of civilization and
coffee with Scott Adams where from nimba
positivity
everywhere else you go today will be
nothing but addiction and bad news but
here here it's addiction and good news
you will be addicted to the good feeling
that we generate today and all you need
to take it to that good place is a
copper bug or a glass of tanker jealous
it's not a canteen Dragon flask that
doesn't live any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the devil being together the
day the thing makes everything better
what's it called yes the simultaneous
sip go
oh
so good
somebody noted that I seem to be able to
remember other things but I can't
remember the
the cup of hug or a glass thing that I
do every morning
there's a reason for that
my memory doesn't store a randomized
things I can only store things that have
context so I can remember a joke for
example
because if I remember the concept of the
joke then I just connected to other
jokes and then it comes out but I don't
have any mechanism for memorizing random
stuff
so I could probably go forever without
remembering that
well let's talk about all the things
so apparently the January 6th narrative
has completely collapsed and the
narrative was we're going to prove to
you that Trump knew he lost
but tried to take over the country
anyway
have they proven that
have they shown
any evidence at all anything
nope nope not a not a single centilla of
evidence of their primary claim right
the primary claim he knew he lost he was
trying to take over the country anyway
has not been proven not only has it not
been proven
I would say it's been debunked
because not only did Trump not try to
take over the country or at least
there's no evidence of it but how do you
explain that Don Jr wasn't in on the
plot
isn't that the funniest part
to be a Democrat you have to accept
that Don Jr wasn't letting on the plot
to take over the country
how did you even mention it to him
[Laughter]
seriously seriously how could you hold
that your hat is true
yeah Trump was trying to take over the
country you know who he never mentioned
it to
Ivanka and Don Jr did mention it
didn't say didn't seem to think it was
important come on
the narrative is so completely destroyed
at this point that it appears that the
Democrats are trying to trying to tell
you that that wasn't really The
Narrative the real narrative is it
didn't do enough to stop it
and so the January 6 people have
reported
that there was a 187 minutes in which he
did nothing
to try to stop it
that's what the January 6 committee is
telling the world
now that 187 minutes
that's based on
nothing they made it up
they actually just made it up
the New York Times And The Washington
Post both have timelines in which that's
not there
I think there's about a 30 minutes
before he spoke and said to everybody be
peaceful go home
30 minutes is basically the time it
takes to decide you're going to speak
right so the actual evidence that the
New York Times Washington Post their
timeline completely debunks
the second main point of the January six
hearings that he didn't do enough
uh yes and he also tweeted during that
time and Twitter took down his tweets
all right so what do you think is the
proper outcome
of a hearing
in which the primary thing is not proven
in fact debunked the primary claim that
he knew he lost
and he was acting to organize a coup
that is now completely debunked by the
people who are trying to prove it true
right it'd be one thing if Republicans
had debunked it
but the Democrats just debunked their
own Theory by not you know by looking as
hard as they could and producing no
evidence whatsoever for it none
but how much evidence do they have for
the weighted 187 minutes claim
not only no evidence it's been hard
debunked by their own side
now what do you think should be the
outcome in that situation
do you think Trump should be charged and
jailed
for what has been totally debunked
probably not you probably don't think
that
do you think that he should be uh you
know uh let's say punished by voters
for waiting for 187 87 minutes when it's
now proven by lots of sources that that
never happened
well here's what I think
I think the members of the January 6
committee
unless they correct it because I'd give
them time to correct it but if they
don't correct that
they should go to jail
I don't know what the crime would be
but if you if you're pushing a fake fact
in front of the country that changes the
nature of politics who could run who's
going to be president that's that's so
close to Insurrection or treason or
something like I don't know if it's a
crime but if you ask me what is what
would be the what would be Justice
Justice in this case would be the
committee themselves going to jail
not being sanctioned not being
sanctioned but actually going to jail
I'm talking about some serious jail time
now that's only if they don't correct
the error that by now they know is an
error if they stick with thee he didn't
do anything they think they have to be
jailed
for what insurrection
I mean if they're trying to change
politics
by an obvious you know clear lie that
won't there won't be any question about
the fact that it's alive at the end of
today
right it's a it's an attempt to change
politics without using the system
if you're trying to change our politics
without using our system and you're not
transparent about it it would be okay if
you're transparent right the stuff Mark
Elias did allegedly you know getting
some rules changed before the election
that's all legal you could you could
hate it but it's all legal you know the
other side should do it too it's legal
you'll get do as much as you can this
legal
but if you do something that's
clearly outside the system and you're
trying to change the system
I think jail time I mean I think that's
a real conversation we have to have I
think Liz Cheney should be looking at
jail time same as kinsiger
for this now again
if they correct themselves today they
have plenty of time to do it but if they
correct themselves today I'd say oh okay
okay that's a mistake
maybe it wasn't a mistake but I'm
willing to you know a 48-hour correction
I'd say that's good enough I don't know
if it's sedition or trees and
Insurrection or coup or whatever it is
but it's certainly the crime that
they're trying to find
if they're looking for something that
looks a lot like a coup
they are it they became the coup
maybe they didn't start that way but
they became the coup if they're trying
to sell the 187 minutes
what do you make of the fact that uh
probably the most important question
about January 6
is who is doing what
about the security of the capital
who was doing what you know who did what
and when to protect the capital
and that's primarily Pelosi's
responsibility isn't it am I wrong
Nancy Pelosi was in charge of security
for the capitol
and is she not testifying
has she been asked to testify
shouldn't they be asking her in public
you know what did you know when and what
did you do about it
has she ever even been interviewed about
it has she ever has she ever sat for an
interview and just an interviewer of any
kind just in the news said you know what
did you do why didn't you why didn't you
do this why did you do that
how do we just sit here and watch this
like it's okay
that's okay
I mean it's a clearly the railroading
Republicans you know if you have any
question about Republicans being hunted
I mean here it is
this is a pretty obvious case
anyway
um
I think the food supply is going to be
okay
here's my optimism for the day were you
worried that the country was a country
or the world I guess would run out of
food
it looks like it's not going to happen
now part of it is a big story that
Ukraine and Russia signed a deal in
which you know the grain would go
through a Turkish
Turkish ownership or something briefly
but basically they found a way to ship
the at least a lot of the grain from
Ukraine now that's not you know the the
full answer
that's not the full answer but
uh I don't think the country is going to
run out of food
and it looks like our shipping situation
you know at the very least they would
they would prioritize the food for
shipping right
does that happen
I'm assuming that if you're a port
and you've got a hundred ships waiting
and one of them has food on it it goes
first right if it's something that would
spoil
uh is delayed we have about two years
under these windmill policies I don't
know what you're talking about
okay oh it's delayed you mean the uh
the food shortages delayed
no grain was planted you know I've got a
feeling that the food shortage thing is
exaggerated
food ships go to bulk terminals
so they have their own their own path is
that what you're saying
all right uh
I don't know it's just my feeling that
we're going to get past the food supply
problem and you might not even notice it
I mean you might notice a few things
uh cerno disagrees disagrees with the
food shortage thing
let's find out
so this is a good test of the atoms law
of slow-moving disasters
now you could argue that one year is not
slow maybe that's too fast obsessive
this is a good Edge case
I think it's long enough
that millions of people made of millions
of adjustments because they see it
coming right don't you think that other
places are planting more grain
certificate predicts food issues for
2023. I think there'll be food issues
there'll definitely be issues I just
don't think there's going to be Mass
starvation
it's just going to be a problem we have
to work through I think I think so let's
let's compare our predictions right
so my prediction is that food shortage
for America
we have to make that difference right
before America will probably just be
prices higher
which is you know plenty bad but but
that's what it will look like I think
and I think there might be you know you
might have a country that for a while
things get tight but I think we'll
figure it out
all right
um provocatively I tweeted that so far
the January 6 hearings have proven Trump
was guilty of the crime of leadership
that's what I say
I say Trump was guilty of leadership
and I
went on and said good leaders do
unpopular and risky Things based on you
know often gut instinct about his wife
what is the right thing to do
that's what he did
everything that Trump did on January 6th
at least the stuff that's confirmed
is all consistent with leadership
now you're saying to me Scott
there's good leadership and there's bad
leadership
well yes
but you usually don't know about that
until after the point
wait gross pork
you're saying this is ridiculous
sophistry before you hear the
argument
look you stupid piece of listen to
the point then make a comment
we'll hide you on this channel and let
the smarter people have a little more
time
okay so first you listen
and then you form an opinion if you do
that opposite form an opinion and then
listen well you're a idiot
so you got that going for you here's my
argument which you have not yet heard
all right
management
is a bunch of people doing what they all
agree to do
management and super efficient
management and supervision refer to
everybody doing what they kind of all
agree should be done
but the manager is just the time keeper
and you know the judge and making sure
it gets stuck would you agree management
is about doing something that everybody
agrees needs needs to get done
leadership
is stuff that people don't agree on
it's leadership if people don't agree
all right you don't need any leadership
to eat a cookie do you
know who needs to tell you to eat a
cookie
if you like cookies
nobody you don't need any leadership to
do that you only need leadership to do
 you don't want to do
I want you to grab that machine gun and
run toward that um
run toward that enemy position through
that hail of bullets
um and this might not be good for you
but it will be good for other people it
will be good for other people
that's leadership
yeah leader leadership is getting people
to do things they didn't know they
wanted to do or don't quite understand
or need to be led to now
if Trump was right let's play a
hypothetical
we'll start with no courts have shown
that there's any there was any fraud in
2020. everybody on the same page
they didn't look for it and they weren't
the right right place to judge that but
they didn't fight a
[Laughter]
sure they didn't find any by virtue of
not looking and saying they didn't have
standing in most cases but it's true
that none has been produced that is you
know court court blessed
um
so we got that so really comes down to
what was Trump thinking
if he was thinking that the that he had
witnessed a rigged election
what would leadership require him to do
what would it require him to do
would it require him to allow the
election to be certified and then let me
ask you this question
if the election got certified
can you imagine any scenario it would
ever be reversed even if
you found out the vote had been rigged
I can't
I don't I don't see any scenario which
we would ever reverse a certified
election would we all agree with that I
mean not in a real world
I mean you could imagine some
hypothetical but not in a real world the
Supreme Court's not going to reverse it
it's just not going to happen now nor do
I think you should
like if it turned out it was just a
little bit of sketchiness
I I know I think I might defer to the
system over the specific outcome
so here's the thing
if Trump believed it had been rigged
what was he supposed to do
a leader
probably would have done almost exactly
what he did
even if you don't like it I don't like
it
I don't like it at all I don't like
anything about it
but do you know what else I don't like
Genghis Khan
don't like him at all
but he was a good leader I mean good
being a you know in quotes he was
effective he was a leader
do you think that all of his Mongol
hordes wanted to do exactly what he told
them to do
probably not
some of them probably wanted to stay
home and do a little farming
but he was a leader so he got him to do
it now
that's an example of evil
now I'm not telling you that Trump was
right
because the life of a leader is if you
guess right and it works out
well then you're George Washington
if you guess wrong
and it doesn't work out
well and you're a loser
but it's still leadership
right it's still leadership even if it
doesn't work
what Trump was doing was not expected
not normal
not part of the normal system that's the
reason there's a whole January 6th thing
right because he was outside the system
outside the system was the only place he
had to operate
if he operated within the system you
knew what the outcome would be a
certified election he only had
outside the system
now is George Washington a hero
or a traitor
sort of both
sort of both but it turns out he was
right and he won
so George Washington won so he gets to
be hero and a leader
what if he lost
would you say he was a leader
yes yes he was still a leader but George
Washington would have been a loser and
history would have judged him poorly I
guess if he'd lost
there's a
there's a troll on YouTube who's trying
to use my actual accurate age as my
insult
how does that work
what are you not going to get older
there's somebody here who thinks he's
immune from aging I think you know if
you get to my age and you still have a
live stream audience you better bat
yourself on the back
because we never heard of you I don't
know what age you are but you're not
exactly making a dent in the universe
here so maybe maybe pick up your game a
little bit then come back
all right well so I don't defend what uh
Trump did or did not do on January 6th
so I want to make that very clear I'm
just putting it in its accurate box
if Trump had stopped the election let's
say delayed if he had delayed the
election certification
and and this is a big if I don't think
it would have happened and
found out that the election was wrong
you know rigged
what would you say then
I think he'd be a hero would he
in other words if he'd been right
that we don't know he was wrong
I would say I would say we probably do
know
I'm not sure about this I think we do
know that if they had delayed the kind
of delay they were asking for sort of a
normal audit recount of the votes
probably wouldn't have made a difference
right so I think if he'd gotten a delay
it would have just gone back to where it
was yeah they would have they would have
done the recount it would have been the
same result because the only things you
could recount
are things that got counted in the first
place
can you recount a missing ballot
how do you do that if a ballot never
makes it to the you know I don't know if
there's a way to do that but if a ballot
never gets run through the counting
machine how do you recount it
if it's just gone I know how in the
world can you know an election was
rigged you can only know you didn't find
it
the only thing you can know is you
didn't find any problems that's all you
can know
so I would like to argue that what has
been proven by January 6 is that Trump
did what a leader with a strong
intuition
unproven but a strong intuition
that he needed to go outside the system
to fix a wrong
and then he did
he didn't fix it but it looks like he
operated on his assumption and I would
say we don't know his assumption was
wrong we only know it hasn't been proven
right
so at the moment he is still in the uh
in my opinion he's still in the uh
uh what is the cat that's half dead box
what's the name of that
why am I blanking on that
the cat is half dead and half alive
that's uh shorter than Scott yeah it's
sort of a Schrodinger's cat
if you knew what he was thinking
well then you'd know if the cat was
alive or dead but you don't
you don't
I mean I assume he was thinking he was
right
but the January 6 people are thinking he
assumed that he was just lying no
evidence of that
all right um there's some weird thing
going on with the word groomer and
Twitter and
um so so as you know the a lot of people
on the political right
have been using that word groomer to
refer to people trying to teach young
children
about the uh let's say the
what would I say the uh
the full diversity of of uh gender and
sexuality
and that uh the people on the right are
saying hey
don't teach our children all these
things they're too early leave that to
us that's not for the school to do and
that maybe what you're doing is grooming
them
meaning
making children friendly to some future
encounter that maybe they would not
otherwise be friendly to
is that grooming well Emma I think it's
a it's a stretch of the word but I would
not condone it except that it really is
just the response to racist isn't it
groomer is just that thing that when you
get called a groomer you can't get it
off
because the accusation is as good as the
fact same with a racist once you've been
called a racist and it gets on the
internet
it doesn't matter that you're not
I mean that's irrelevant
so same way it doesn't matter if the
people being accused are actually
groomers that's their intent or anything
it doesn't matter because the accusation
you know is damning enough
so well I disagree with the use and I
don't believe have you ever heard me use
it I've never called anybody a groomer
have I
I believe I've never used that not in a
tweet not on a live stream it's not
something I would say
it's not in my domain of things I would
naturally go to I'll talk about it
but I'm not going to call somebody a
groomer because that assumes something
about their inner thoughts that I don't
know is an Evidence
but here's what the weird ironic thing
is just as the January 6 hearings have
probably made it a guarantee that Trump
will return to office that's my opinion
in my opinion in my opinion the January
6th thing here let me explain this and
I'll digress back to the groomer thing
I've told you about the Jerry Spence
he's a famous defense attorney retired
now I assume and uh if he's still alive
I don't know he's pretty old
but he taught us that if you want to win
a case for your client he was usually
working for the you know the person who
was injured
he takes the jury and he makes them
imagine they're in the place of the
person who is victimized you put them in
the story
if you put somebody in the story
they will abandon their logical feeling
about the story and they'll replace it
with the emotions that they got when
they were imagining themselves as the
victim
and apparently that works pretty much
every time it's like a really strong
it's really strong persuasion
now think what the January 6 people did
accidentally
think about all the you are there videos
they showed like video from within the
crowd
they were trying intentionally
to put you into the crowd were they not
check me on that were they not trying to
put you into the crowd so you could feel
the danger
you could feel the violence right that
was the whole point they put you in the
crowd
here's what they didn't count on
who did you identify with and by you I
mean you like the people watching this
live stream who largely are going to be
you know right friendly or right leaning
a little bit most of you not all of you
right if if you were a Republican or if
you were a trump supporter and you
watched the January 6 hearings you say
to yourself two things
oh my God they're trying to hunt and
jail people like me just like me
people who believe there was something
wrong with the election if that's what
you believe you're saying my God
everybody there is just like me they
look like me they talk like me they
believe what I believe and they actually
they're doing things that I would have
done
you know maybe I didn't go to Washington
but
I would have right under the right
conditions
so who who are one-third of the country
let's say the you know the the
Republicans who were Trump friendly one
third of the country is watching this
and they put themselves in the wrong
people
wrong in terms of the intentions of the
January 6 hearing their intention was to
make you identify with the uh either the
politicians I think I think how stupid
this is
the point of it was Congress was showing
you this Congress is showing this to
hope that you would identify with
members of Congress
do you see it yet they'll show you the
video
to get you to identify
with the members of Congress to feel how
they felt when all this violence was
happening
was that smart
because Congress is feels like more like
the enemy doesn't it
who exactly identifies with the Enemy
nobody
they identify with themselves
and they just saw a whole bunch of
themselves trying to get something done
and being demonized for it
now do you believe that it's backfiring
and that well let me ask you something
prior to the January 6 hearings if you
ask me would I support Trump for
president my answer was hell no
to all too divisive time for something
new
after about eight weeks of listening to
the January 6
show trial do you know what my current
opinion is
we need Trump again
because what is happening he's the only
person who's probably has the balls to
do something about it and if you said to
me Scott you know all those things you
don't want to happen again all the
division you know all the things happen
to your own career I mean my career got
like hammered just by saying anything
good about the Trump experience
and
what I feel is I'm under attack
I feel that I'm under attack and I feel
that Trump is literally the only person
who would do anything about it
and so my opinion of him has gone way up
I don't know it's probably a
confirmation bias
you know I mean there's a psychological
there's a psychological phenomenon
that's happening in my head that I'm
aware of meaning that I am abandoning my
rational thought
because they're making me
like the Democrats are making reabanded
my rational thoughts my rational thought
says we don't want another Trump
do you know my irrational thought is
it goes like this
you you
if you make me look like those coup
plotters one more day I'm going to give
you four more years of trump and I'm
going to shove him up your ass
like the gerbil from hell
and I'm going to love it
and you know what it might cost me a
little bit more in my career you
 you
yeah it might cost me another 20 off my
career yeah if you make me look like
those coup plotters again I mean
that's your Narrative of it that's not
what they were if you do that to me
another few weeks I'm going to
make sure that Trump gets elected and
I'm going to shove him all the way up
your ass
like a like a crazed gerbil up of you
know
Richard Gere's ass allegedly allegedly
so just keep begging for it right just
keep begging for it you idiots
if you beg for it I'll give it to you
but you are begging right now you are
 begging for this
keep begging
I'll give you exactly what you want
so this I think this uh play by the
January Sixers will go in the history
books as one of the worst political
plays of all time I think they've
guaranteed Trump a landslide
I wasn't even sure you'd get nominated
two months ago I wasn't sure you could
get the nomination
today
I don't see how he loses I really don't
I mean it's hard for you to imagine a
scenario that he's not president again
yeah
so yeah good job there on bad persuasion
Democrats making us try to uh
literally they literally tried to get us
to identify with the the group that's
the lowest approval rating
that isn't called the KKK
am I right
the I think the only entity that has a
lower public approval than Congress is
probably the KKK
and I'm not even sure about that
all right well let's go back to this
groomer thing
um it feels as if Media Matters is
making another gigantic persuasion
mistake I think Media Matters I saw a
rumor
I need a fact check on this but there
was there were I think Media Matters was
pushing the let's get rid of groomer as
as a social media word and then Twitter
Twitter originally was Banning it but
then I think they reversed
so I like how Twitter handled this
actually I don't mind
and you might disagree with this I don't
mind when Twitter bans anything
all right so now you can you can hate me
and disagree with me for a second before
I give you my reason
I don't mind when Twitter bans anything
I just want him to look at it you know
just give it a good look
and then make sure it's compatible with
your rules
and you know that's okay so I don't mind
the Banning as long as they look at it
closely and then make a decision
and then secondly I might disagree with
the decision but that's a separate issue
but that but the question of should
Twitter you know act quickly on
something that you know has a red flag
yeah sure sure I think that actually
makes the service better not worse
because a little bit of a little bit of
delay on a tweet you know 24 hours yeah
I don't know that's fine
so I don't mind that but here's what I
think they're doing by accident
I be I Believe by accident the people
who are trying to remove groomer from
the conversation
have just added another G to lgbtq
that's not what they're trying to do
but they kind of
they kind of made the case
that the groomer thing is about lgbtq
which correct me if I'm wrong
but it's not
right
I I don't believe I've ever heard one
conservative ever say I don't like those
lgbtq people
I've now heard that once
I have heard them say I don't care where
your penis is
it could be still connected to your body
it could be in some you know petri dish
somewhere for for posterity we don't
care where it is
just don't talk to our kids about sex
am I wrong
I I feel like I'm characterizing the
argument correctly
we don't care where you put your penis
or where your vagina is or if you have
one
we don't care what you identify with
what's in your brain
we don't care
I'm saying we but you know I'm not
really talking about we I don't think
the conservatives care
do they
they only care if it affects them and
specifically
their children and they're not even
talking about the gay part now I do
think that the you know the flamboyant
part becomes part of the story if you
see an anecdote of that's who's you know
sending the message forward
so yeah I mean there's certainly an
overlap
there's an overlap but I would think
there's a bigger overlap in just generic
straight people pushing the same stuff
right
you know if every LGBT if every lgbtq
person was you know magically removed
from the story
wouldn't you solve the same situation
in other words wouldn't there be plenty
of straight white teachers who still
want to give the same lesson they just
won't bring in the trans activists to
help with the lesson but it'd be the
same lesson wouldn't it
now there is a question of normalizing
normalizing
the behavior
get over it
let's who cares right everything is
normalized and unnormalized I mean
that's not the thing I'm worried about
yeah
so the the real question is sex
education in schools and the people who
say that is grooming
uh I think it's accidental grooming
but it probably has that effect
meaning I'm not sure that you can read
the minds of all the people involved in
in all this but I would agree that it's
likely to have the effect of normalizing
some lifestyles
in the minds of children
who then may be more confused instead of
less confused maybe I don't know
I'm no expert on any of this I don't
have any don't have any kids in that
situation
um
the the only the only thing I'm going to
add add to the conversation
is that I think that the people who are
trying to protect the lgbtq community
allegedly that's what they're trying to
do
I think they may have moved in the other
direction by somewhat confirming that
they're lumping these groups together
that the conservatives weren't exactly
doing
you know they may have been doing it
unintentionally but it wasn't exactly
the point of it
all right uh there are three groups or
entities that Democrats trust to make
major health decisions
including Health Care
number one is Joe Biden right they
Democrats trust Joe Biden to make major
decisions about health care and health
outcomes
uh the other is Congress
you know a democrat congress
but I'd say Democrats trust a democrat
congress with major health decisions
so they trust Joe Biden with health
decisions they trust Congress and the
third entity is uh Little Children
small children
so that that's the three groups the
Democrats Trust
uh with their major health care
decisions and and for other people not
just their own
and illegal aliens I don't know about
that but
yeah they they trust children
well I think the uh best political play
that I've seen in a long time is the
Republicans shift to become the uh the
parent party
and I don't know that they planned that
I think it just happened that way
because you got the grooming issue
you've got the school choice issue
you've got uh you know the abortion
issue and when you yeah and even the
crime issue social media damage issue
that although that could cross cross
parties
seems to me
um
that that's just the best branding I've
ever seen
you know to the extent
I believe any Republican could win by
branding themselves you know
um pro-parent
I I just think that's pro-parent it just
gets it all done
there's nothing else to talk about if
you brand yourself pro-parent and you
have policies that you know suggest that
that's real
how do you lose how do you lose that
election I don't know you can I think he
would just win every election after that
point but but you have to you have to
make the branding stick right
and I think I think their policies are
you know even if I don't agree with some
of them
uh they're certainly consistent with
being a parent pro-parent approach
all right now that Republicans are seen
better on education
according to new polls I think it's done
oh by the way I forgot to mention this
but I saw Jeff Giza if I'm pronouncing
it right tweet in which he said that uh
Trump's popularity uh among Republican
voters I guess mostly his popularity was
well below DeSantis in the beginning of
the summer
and then as the January 6th stuff went
on uh Trump just zoomed to pass
this is only unpredicted so this is
people predicting the outcome so the
people predicting
because of January 6 predicted that uh
that Trump would win again
instead of predicting that DeSantis so
it's not proof that the January 6 things
backfired
but it's very consistent with my
hypothesis that the January 6th thing
was a complete backfire politically
yeah the mole is back right
uh that's a call back
all right so Bannon got uh convicted of
uh refusing to testify to Congress even
though he is going to testify
and he'll appeal that Etc I guess he is
punishable by 30 days to one year behind
bars and a fine ranging from a hundred
dollars to a hundred thousand
now Bannon seems to be confident that it
will be reversed on appeal what do you
think
do you think it will be reversed on
appeal
I feel like it will
yeah like 80 chance that's the odds I
give it I feel like it will and I don't
know what arguments are going to make
but it seems like some kind of equal
protection thing is a slam dunk because
won't they be able to uh yeah dershowitz
says it will be reversed on appeal okay
I'm done
I've told you my dershowitz uh rule
right
the the dershowitz rule goes like this
then no matter what my opinion is on a
legal question
once dershowitz tells you his opinion I
just go okay forget about mine we'll
we'll just take his opinion because his
opinion is always going to be better
than mine
and anything anything related to your
law
so if there's which thinks it'll be
reversed it will I love the way Bannon
is handling this
abandoned is uh thanking the jury who
found him guilty
thanking the courts and agreeing that
they have the right verdict
which is interesting
he he was convicted he expects to be it
to be overturned but also things that he
that the jury got it right
now that
is good technique
that's a really good technique
the the bad technique would be to say
the jury got it wrong and we'll reverse
it on appeal
because the jury was only only asked to
look at the specific facts the jury is
not an appeals court right it can only
look at does the law say you had to say
yes to testifying
did you say yes to testifying that's it
and that's all the jury does and so he
quite accurately said yeah the jury
thank them for their time thank them for
the you know taking the day off
but it won't make any difference
in the long run their verdict has
probably no impact on anything because
I'm sure he'll be well now that
dershowitz says it I'm more confident
that he'll it'll be reversed
but again
if you're uh let me ask you this if you
are a Republican now let me say this if
you're a trump supporter
did the ban in prosecution make you more
or less a trump supporter
probably more right
because again when you look at Steve
Bannon who do you see
you see yourself
if if you were if you were like-minded
and many of you are and you're supported
Trump for example you see yourself
that's who I see when I look at Bannon I
see myself
because I talk about the same topics
often in controversial ways yeah I
absolutely see myself going to jail when
I see Bannon get convicted so no I will
vote for anybody who won't send me to
jail
and I think my best bet would be Trump
do you think that well let me ask you
this this is a serious question
so you've seen the treatment of various
notable pundit types
if a republican does not get elected
again
do you think that I personally have any
legal risk
like actually going to jail
let me think
some of you are saying yes
yeah a lot a lot of no's a lot of news
beloved essence
here's the thing
Democrats
if the Democrats are making me feel like
I might go to jail
how am I going to act
what what is the right response to
feeling there's there's a a good chance
you'll go to jail for not committing a
crime
not committing a crime
what would be my most normal reaction to
that
full nuclear
full nuclear
you know I've told you before well I
don't know if I've told you lately but
there's an ethical problem with being a
trained Persuader
and the ethical problem is much like
being a professional boxer
if you're a professional boxer you don't
want to get in a street fight because
you might accidentally kill somebody
because they're not trained like you are
so that would be you know that would be
murder
um in the case of being a trained
hypnotist I do intentionally reduce my
power
for ethical reasons like like I could
um I don't know if I want to say this
out loud but I've gone this far so I
will I could erase you free will if I
wanted to
I could erase your free will
if I wanted to
but I don't
because I would consider that you know
deeply unethical
but
if you push me hard enough
and you tell me I'm going to go to jail
what would I do if you said well you're
going to go to jail
unless you erase somebody's free will
now's a different equation
if I have to erase somebody's free will
to stay out of jail
I will now the Free Will is an illusion
right Free Will is a myth so I'd be
erasing your illusion and substituting
my opinion for whatever was going to
happen but it would look like I was
erasing your free will that's what it
would feel like
so I I'm just going to warn you
and I'm just going to warn you that this
whole January 6th stuff the band and
stuff
um
if they come after me
and I think there's a non-zero chance of
that happening
I'm gonna go full nuclear
I I'm just I'm going to take all the
controls off and you've never seen that
you've never seen that
maybe you don't want to
but if I go nuclear it's going to get
dark it's going to get dark really fast
and and things will change
so let's hope we don't see that
all right
um someone needs to make a list of all
the things you need to believe to be a
Democrat lately
um I started in the list but here's
you're just like a starter list
in order to be a Democrat today you
would have to believe that Republicans
love guns oh my God they love guns but
they don't bring them to a coup
they love guns but they don't bring them
to a coup
now the Democrats will say well Scott
they were a bunch of guns
 you you there was no guns
there were some guns that were not
brandished
Republicans have guns in their trucks
Republicans have guns nearby there were
some bad people
who had stocks of guns that they're
they're definitely sketchy
but it wasn't about that right it was
literally a peaceful thing with some
dangerous elements like most protests
mostly mostly good but some bad elements
all right if you are a Democrat you have
to believe
that Trump knew he had lost the election
which is unknowable
you have to believe that Trump
alone among all human mammals
knows the unknowable
which is that the election was fair now
we do know that there's no proof it was
unfair and therefore you know the system
goes forward and should they should I've
always I've always supported Biden being
certified
just because I don't want to destroy the
system even even if it got a bad result
all right so you'd have to believe that
Trump knew the unknowable that the
election was totally fair
totally unknowable
might be true
uh you also have to believe that uh
that Trump was planning a coup without
mentioning it to Don Jr or Ivanka
to me that's the funniest one
like like have you ever tried saying
that to uh try this out try saying this
to a Democrat who believes it was a
planned organized coup just say you know
that the January 6th thing they proved
that Don Jr didn't know there was a
coupe land
just just don't let them change the
subject for a moment because they'll
immediately change the subject say about
you
know
is that your belief
that there was a Coupland but Trump
didn't bring Don Jr into it
or Ivanka
just watch their face and just see if
they can keep like anything that looks
like a
non-npc face
when they have to explain how Don Jr was
not brought into the plot
I mean seriously come on
is that not the end of the conversation
right so correct me
you lied correct me if we we have you
know the evidence is that Don Jr was
trying to get Trump
to you know call off the uh the protest
I mean it's very clear that he wasn't in
on anything
do you know one reason that I'll never
be put on a Democrat platform while this
is going on
imagine me saying that in public on CNN
you know imagine MSNBC making the
mistake of inviting me on to talk about
this
and I just say you know I just got this
one question
how do you believe that Don Jr wasn't
brought into the plot and then I would
just laugh
and they they try to change the subject
I'd be like no no no no seriously Don
Lemon just kind of know
is that your belief that uh that Trump
didn't bring Don Jr into this his
couplot
really yeah really
[Laughter]
that's it
all right uh you'd also have to believe
Bill reform works
you have to believe that Putin caused
the inflation yeah some other stuff
um you'd also have to believe that
Democrat democrat-run cities are just as
safe as anywhere else you have to
believe that Biden doesn't have any uh
mental capacity problems whatsoever he's
fine he's fine
no problem here
but I think there's a funnier list if I
spent more time on it I think there's a
funnier list of things you would have to
believe to to buy the the narrative
the Hunter
Hunter is the smartest well
you know I don't think that's been
disproven
so Joe Biden says Hunter is the smartest
person he knew
the smart people can be addicted
right
smart people have addictions that
happens all the time because the
addiction is bigger than the brain like
your brain has no no defense against
addiction
so if you said he was addicted
and if you said let's say he had no
ethical core
those have nothing to do with this
intelligence he could be addicted he
could be completely immoral
but also the smartest person that Joe
Biden knows because you know what the
smartest
immoral addict would look like to me
the smartest immoral addict would be
someone who made millions of dollars
from an enemy regime
for doing next next to nothing
that's what the smartest addicted
immoral person would look like to me
it would look like somebody who had
unlimited uh Coke and sacks and hookers
and got away with it
lived a complete party life made maybe
tens of millions of dollars and avoided
all prosecution
if that's
selling influence is not nothing
well it is nothing if there's no
influence remember people were buying
the hope of influence they weren't
buying actual influence
you can't buy actual influence you can
only buy access
so access gives you the hope of
influence it doesn't give you influence
it's still up to you
yeah so I don't disagree that Hunter
might be the smartest person he knows
it's just that he's also an addict which
goes to the immoral part right you can't
be an addict and tell the truth
well I suppose you could it was rare
right you know once you say addict
uh lying is just built into the word do
you all know that there's no such thing
as an addict who tells the truth
I I don't know if they can I I think
it's just erased from their from their
ability is I'm not even making like a
judgment call
that's that's not even like an insult
if somebody's an addict
they're a liar
it just comes with it you know you could
say that oh I know an honest addict who
tells you exactly what they do okay
no they're lying about something else
probably
even the honest addict doesn't tell you
exactly what they're taking
yeah so as soon as you say addict you
don't have to say anything else about
the other stuff that comes with it it's
just comes along with it
um let's see
yeah
right
uh you know I also it makes me wonder if
lying is a
maybe an indicator of a future addict
you know I wonder
I know it doesn't work that way you know
the causation is addiction first and
then lying but I always question I
always question causality no matter how
obvious it is it's obvious that the
probable causation is that being an
addict makes you a liar but I would not
rule out
that people who have trouble lying like
they just can't lie
would be less likely to become an addict
because at some point you know you have
to lie to do it
like you can't really get into it in the
first place without lying about that
first part
no no I didn't try higher heroin
no I mean you have to you have to be
working on getting addicted it doesn't
happen on day one so I feel like you got
to be a liar at least by Omission or lie
to yourself or something so I do wonder
if being a liar let's say a compulsive
liar you know like a real liar
I wonder if that
predicts that you'll become an addict I
know
somebody says that's absurd and you
could be right I don't know if it's
absurd it could be wrong
I mean it could be 100 wrong
but I don't know if it's absurd
I think absurds too far
yeah now by the way this is a real good
habit
so my habit is as soon as somebody tells
me there's a correlation
this causes this the very first thing I
think is well maybe it's just a
correlation about a causation that's the
first thing you should think then the
second thing you should think is
maybe it's reversed
maybe the causation is backwards now not
always
not always
can you have an oxytocin addiction
kind of
kind of
yeah if you don't get hugged or loved
enough you're going to have an oxytocin
shortage and I do think it makes you
crazy
do you think that not being touched can
give you mental illness
what do you think
yeah I think so I think so yeah I think
that not being touched gives you mental
illness
everybody it looks like it's a complete
yes
yeah it just uh yes yes yes yes yes sure
basically all of you how many of you
are conscious
like right now
how many of you are conscious of not
getting touched enough like you know
your oxytocin is low
how many of you are low on oxytocin
yeah most of you now some of that is uh
who I attract to this live stream now
I've noticed that
um many of you use this live stream
exactly how I hoped
and how I hoped is that I would feel
like your friend
because I am
right I'm on your side and I talk to you
every day
and even when I don't want to be here I
do it anyway
I don't know if you know that I mean
there are days there are days I wake up
and I think you know as much as I love
doing this and I do love doing it like I
genuinely like doing this that's why I'm
right here I mean I've already gone long
probably
right it's eight o'clock right I don't
have to be doing this now there's but I
like it
but there are days there are days
especially when I was traveling in the
time zone it was different where there
were a few days I didn't want to do it
but I did it for you
because I know that if your friend
doesn't show up
it'll affect your day and I don't want
to do that to you
I would like you to have a good day so
I'm your friend in the sense that I
literally every day I'm trying to help
you have a good day
am I not
right now of course it's also a business
model and I monetize a Blog that helps
that helps me you know encourages me to
do it every day it's part of the process
but I feel like my primary motivation is
that you like it
if you didn't like it I wouldn't
monetize it even if I could
um
someone on locals said they lost their
dog and couldn't wait to hear your voice
this morning did somebody just lose
their dog
because I have heard of people losing
their dog and
oh
I'm sorry
I have a very old dog myself and I know
that my day my day is approaching
yeah
you see me on date well
you know you probably know I had a a
tough pandemic
we all had a tough pandemic
but
um
showing up here was part of my therapy
too
oh
yeah it was all part of my therapy as
well so you helped me as much as I help
you so we're friends
and uh let's keep that up
yeah you know I I've heard of people
losing dogs and
uh and having more of a problem than
losing people
like actually literally not that's not a
joke
you know I I have a friend of mine who
years ago had a dog had him for many
years and then never got a dog again
and everybody asked uh why don't you get
another dog
you so love that dog
and he said when I lost my dog it felt
like losing a limb
and it never went away
yeah so I didn't understand it until
then
and you know I have a dog
and I don't know what it's going to feel
like when I don't
but I don't like that part about feeling
like I lost a limb so for all of you who
have lost a
dog by the way I feel like cats are
different I don't know I mean I feel
plenty sad when I lose a cat as I've
lost several in my life
but I feel like the dog is going to be
different I really do I don't know why
am I right I feel like the dog is going
to be a completely different feeling
all right anyway I don't want to lose an
end on that so let me give you the
positive spin on this
anybody who's in your life
and it's positive
it's a gift
right you wouldn't enjoy having anybody
in your life if you couldn't lose them
it's built in
you have to have the risk not the risk
the guarantee of tragedy you have to
have the guarantee of tragedy to make
your life have any value at all
so
don't hate it accept it
sort of the Buddhist the Buddhist way I
mean I'm bastardizing it but the
Buddhist way is you don't try to avoid
pain like all pain
because life is life is suffering
you have to learn to enjoy the suffering
and that sounds ridiculous the first
time you hear it doesn't it
doesn't that sound like absurd you have
to learn to enjoy the pain
that doesn't sound like something you
can do
and you can
you can it's it's actually doable
uh in in some areas I've I've managed to
do it and when you when you do it like
just in an area I can't do it like all
the time for my whole life but there are
some times when you say well let me give
you an example when I lost my stepson
to fentanyl a few years ago
I I wanted the pain to go away
you know the pain of the loss but I also
didn't
I didn't because if the pain went away
then the meaning would go away
and I didn't want to lose the meaning
so the meaning was more valuable to me
than the pain and so when I started to
realize that the pain and the meaning
were inseparable
I merged them
I merged them
and now I I take the pain of the loss
with the meaning
and there's just one thing now
so when I when I see my steps on
because you know you see them everywhere
it
you know it's not it's not like a
tragedy feeling it's more like positive
well anyway
on that note YouTube I will talk to you
tomorrow Spotify thanks for joining
