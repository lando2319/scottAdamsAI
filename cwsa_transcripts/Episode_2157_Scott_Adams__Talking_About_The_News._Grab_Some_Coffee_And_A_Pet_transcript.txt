foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
and as you know and I'm sure you do know
this by now
the rest of the media is going to be
boring and repetitive today but not us
we got some stuff to talk about after
the simultaneous hip and maybe maybe
stay tuned I'll do a spaces live at the
same time so you can you can multitask
but first
how would you like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody's
ever seen before well all you need is a
cover of mug or a glass of tanker
jealous of style and the canteen
geographlask of vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope be new of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
ah
now in case you're new to this live
stream the proper way to consume it
there are two ways possibly three
number one goes excellent with exercise
if you're running on the beach for
example hey Joel
or if for example
you were sipping coffee and had a
blanket on you in the morning and a dog
or a cat on your lap
if you've got a dog or a cat with you
and you're sipping a beverage and
listening to this you're the happiest
person in the world so keep doing what
you're doing
all right here's the news let's start
with some semi-fake news uh this is Fox
Fox News has some semi fake news the
headline says White House reports
signals uh wait White House yeah White
House report signals openness to
manipulating sunlight to prevent climate
change
do you think that's a true story
that the White House has signaled an
openness
to block the Sun
well what does openness mean
wouldn't you and if you read this
wouldn't you assume that they were kind
of serious about blocking the Sun
a little bit stop that climate change
do you think that the details of the
story will support this headline
of course not
no they're they're studying it
the only thing that the only thing
they're open to is studying it
being open to look into something is
very different than being open to doing
it
you wouldn't study it if you thought it
was a good idea
I mean if if you were sure it was so
they're just as uncertain As You Are
but they're looking at it
do you think it's impossible that they
could come up with
some kind of temporary thing that would
seed the clouds or whatever they need to
do and and still not be dangerous
well potentially
you know obviously you have to worry if
they do it wrong it's the end of human
civilization
so there's that
but now I wouldn't worry about it I
think it's just one of those two on the
nose
the White House wants to block out the
sun to change climate change that's a
little
a little too on the news I think maybe
they're just studying it because they
study everything
somebody's got an idea let's go study
that that doesn't mean anything
all right uh you know that there is a
massive protest in France that are
ongoing
uh Trump weighed in on that
he said I wouldn't go to France France
is no longer France
Trump actually said he wouldn't go to
France
now uh of course you know that the
the riots are over the shooting of a
Young Man
I think from Northern Africa Muslim I
think but
I'm not even sure that's the reason
people are are writing you know that's
the that's the excuse but of course
there are bigger issues
now some of the writers
probably want to take over the country
and make it in an Islamic country
reasonable you'd expect that they'd want
that
um and some of them were probably just
having fun and causing trouble and
looting and it's probably people have
all kinds of different reasons or
they're just mad about white people or
whatever they're doing
but here's how many of you would know
the percentage of Muslim population in
France don't look it up don't look it up
don't Google it the percentage of their
population that's Muslim right now
what do you think
some of you know the right answer is not
25 but I can see why you'd be guessing
that but no it's not 25. it's about 10
about 10 percent
um what is the percent of Muslim
uh residents of the United States Muslim
residents of the United States what
percent
one percent one percent so Fred says 10
times the amount of Muslim population
and they're and that's the population
that seems to be the most worked up at
the moment you know it was some time ago
I don't remember who said it
it was a there was a percentage of
Muslim population
that would guarantee you became Muslim
that the entire country would eventually
become Muslim do you remember what that
number was
it was 10 percent
I think if he had 10 you end up going
Muslim and
uh I think it has something to do with
maybe maybe you can do a fact check on
me the reasoning behind that was
uh one might be birth rate
there's a higher birth rate
but the the other might be that
um
that's just that's just the percentage
that they try to take power when I say
they I mean if there's any members of
the group
who think that the country should become
an Islamic rule sure yeah Sharia law if
you have 10 of your population Islamic
they're probably going to try
now the you know your point of view of
whether that's the worst thing in the
world or the best thing in the world
would probably depend if you're Muslim
so
you you can't say it would be a terrible
idea if they wanted to take over once
they got some power because that's what
everybody does everybody who has power
tries to use it so it looks like they
have power
um
tell me I'm wrong
France's re-electing president Trump
France is pretty much guaranteeing Trump
gets into office isn't he
now you know if something happened to
Toronto previous legal problems or he
self-implosed I mean there are lots of
things that could keep him out but I
don't know how America can watch France
if they're paying attention
now the other thing is that people
aren't paying attention
I I only just started paying attention I
think the the rise in France how long
have they been going on
I I just today decided to get interested
because I never expect riots to last
long
so a riot in another country doesn't
interest me they're like that's two
weeks of rioting
and then it goes away but maybe not
maybe this is bigger Belgium's got their
issues too
so
um I think the biggest the biggest thing
this does is guarantees that Trump or
somebody who's a republican gets elected
I don't know how you could watch this
and say you want to be like it
but
let me make a very important distinction
if we're bringing Christian immigrants
across the border
we would have our own different set of
challenges but it won't be this
you know the the Christians that are
coming across from Central America and
Mexico are not looking to you know
change the nature of the country
um in fact their assimilation rate is is
awesome
so here's the way I would handle it if I
were Trump
this would be really delicate I don't
know if you could get away with it I
think you should get some kind of
independent Bobby
to determine how many of what kind of
immigrants you can let in
before it changes the nature of the
country
and it could be different for different
groups
so I I would be opposed to ending you
know Muslim immigration
that doesn't I mean that seems like way
too much
but I wouldn't be opposed to having
different limits of rates of people
coming in based on how much of a
disruption you think it would be and the
Iran the amount of disruption probably
has everything to do with assimilation
rates and nothing to do with you know
genetics or anything like that it's just
there's some cultures that are designed
to assimilate
and some that are designed to resist
assimilation
in my opinion
the South American you know Central
American culture is so compatible with
American you know once you get the
language going
it pretty much is a smooth process right
somebody comes from
Australia to the United States
smooth process
New Zealand smooth process right China
not so bad
you know Asian immigrants have done an
amazing job assimilation of Asian
Americans
really good really good let's let's get
some more right how about Indian
Americans assimilation
excellent excellent let's have some more
but the Islamic is immigration is a
different animal because the Islamic
system will kill you if you leave it
so that's that's an anti-assimilation
philosophy
so if you bring people in who have a
assimilation or at least they don't mind
you know they're not opposed to it
you can assume that's going to go
smoothly in the long run
if you bring a group in who's stated
philosophy and religion is no we don't
assimilate you assimilate to us
what do you expect
but even then I would I would make sure
that you you know I'd make sure that
we're bringing in people from everywhere
because it's good in the long run you
just got to make sure your rates
and your numbers make sense
for the philosophy of the people you're
bringing in right
so that's what I think I think uh Trump
or Rama Swami could sell the hell out of
that
um
sure
um what do you think is going to happen
in France
does it look to you like this is just
gonna get bigger and bigger until it's
on the end
or do you think there'll be some kind of
France first movement will there be a
trump you know Marie Le Pen or something
will there be a trump-like character
that rises there
you know what I heard I I heard that uh
brexit is unpopular in Great Britain
is that true give me a fact check on
that that there are more people in
Britain who wish they had not done
brexit is that true
yeah I don't know if that's true
I read that but
um
yeah yeah then the the Muslim population
would be uh not too compatible with the
woke population
so that's an issue
all right but it does make you like
Muslims better probably
it's a very pro-muslim
um
kind of theme
that they're against many of the same
things that many of you are against so
at least you have common enemies that's
something
all right
um
Twitter of course is having some issues
today and it is just weird watching
people flip out about it
does it really matter that much if
Twitter has some glitches
is that is that affecting us a lot I
mean
I don't know I mean I experienced some
little irregularities yesterday but how
much did it affect your life I mean not
much on a weekend and it's a weekend how
much did you really need it
but anyway I was looking at some of the
the takes uh here's the dumbest take
I'm not even going to tell you who it
was it's just somebody on Twitter who
decided to say this in public
that Elon Musk has experience running
Twitter is proof that rich people
shouldn't run companies
laughs
how drunk do you have to be to tweet
that
that's right the problems through
Twitter are more proof that rich people
like Elon Musk should not be involved in
business
somebody actually wrote that
that was like a real tweet from a real
person who thought that I got a point
here I've got a good point Watch the
watch the retweets rack up on this one
wow
wow
all right but here's one that's uh more
puzzling and it's puzzling because the
person who's saying it is so smart
which is always kind of messes with my
mind I'm used to you know I'm very
accustomed to disagreeing with stupid
people
aren't we all disagreeing with somebody
who's stupid it's pretty easy and
comfortable and you're probably glad you
did it
but what happens when you agree with
somebody who's really smart
doesn't that give you a little pause or
you disagree with them
shouldn't you take a step back and say
maybe
here's one of those
so Professor Scott Galloway was
retweeting his own tweet from I think uh
right around after musk had purchased
Twitter and Professor Galloway was
saying that recent events and I think he
means the the Twitter technical problems
are happening right now I think that was
more evidence that he was right
when he said right after the Takeover
um that that Moss is sort of a cult of
personality and his net wealth will be
cut in half
or could be cut in half because of the
Twitter purchase
um is it Elon Musk still the richest
person in the world
am I wrong
you're still the richest person in the
world isn't he
I believe he is
did his wealth get cut in half
I don't recall that happening no
um so that prediction hasn't come
through
but uh during so Professor Galloway said
this during a conversation with CNN's
Christian Amanpour and Amanpour said
that musk is quote unraveling before our
eyes right now this is two years ago
so like or when did you buy it was it a
year ago time is I've lost me sense of
time but whatever it was that musk uh
bought Twitter do you think musk is
unraveling before her eyes
when did that happen
when was this alleged unraveling
he said one of the best years at any
business person has ever had in the
history of business
he's unraveling right between so
here's what I tweeted when did musk say
he bought Twitter to make money
was there ever one time the Elon Musk
even hinted
that Twitter was a good investment and
that's why you bought it no he's always
said the opposite he directly says the
opposite you wouldn't buy Twitter to
make money
you just wouldn't do that
so why is that even a metric
he bought it for saving free speech did
he did he succeed at saving free speech
I say yes
I say yes I would say that Twitter is
the only place you can have free speech
right now
am I wrong about that I don't believe
there's a second place what's the second
place you go to for your free speech
name it name your second place
well gab okay yeah there's some friends
when I won't say Fringe there's some
alternative entities that are you know
too small to be meaningful at the point
yeah Rumble Rumble I'll give you Rumble
you know within within bounds I mean
Rumbles
got constraints as well
Dilbert dilber reborn is one place you
can get free speech but that only
applies to me apparently I'm the only
one who has it and that's only because
it's beyond a subscription wall
anyway
um I was fascinated because
I don't understand the attack on on Musk
from Scott Galloway
so I feel like he's he's judging him on
a standard that doesn't fit the
situation
If he if he said I'm going to try to
make money with this and then failed I'd
agree with them you said the opposite
though
all right
uh there's another mass shooting and I
don't know Baltimore
uh
28 people were injured
two of them died 20 walked into
hospitals
I don't even know what to say about it
anymore
what do you say about it anymore I mean
now it's just business as usual isn't it
so
do you think this is a gun problem
is it a gun problem
I would say this is a
people living in dangerous places
problem
because isn't there a higher gun well
let me ask a question isn't there a
higher gun ownership rate in the in this
in the country
than in the cities
you know per person aren't there way
more guns in the country
oh did I lose out
um looks like I lost sound
so I'm going to have to find another
microphone for my hold on hold on
I think I have another microphone
[Music]
I'll be back in a moment
how about now
um
there we go
sorry I forgot to
fix it the first time no the uh the
light didn't come on the first time so
it wouldn't have stayed
it only stayed up for a second because
the battery was dead
but we're all good now aren't we
all right thanks for telling me
so yeah there's not much to say about
the mass shooting except uh
people should move out of those areas if
they can
so if you want to be where you're you
have a low chance of being shot
you should go where there's a low chance
of being shot
which ironically is probably where there
are more guns in the country
all right let's talk about Ukraine so I
was reading all the social media about
Ukraine and here's what we know about
the the counter-offensive uh there's one
of three things happening in Ukraine and
I'm pretty sure about this all right
it's hard to be certain about things in
the Ukraine but finally I have certainty
there's one or three things happening
with the Ukrainian trying to break
through they're either having no
progress whatsoever
or they're breaking through in a small
way
or they've made major gains
so it's one of those three things I'm
sure of it I'm sure of it yeah so the
reporting on Ukraine is absolutely
useless
so they're they're either successfully
probing for weaknesses and any moment
they're going to run through with their
entire Army
so it's really going well
or or they've made no progress
whatsoever and it's a big old
slaughterhouse
it's one of those two things I'm sure of
it by the way
have you seen progosian lately
does anybody have a picture of him on
his balcony or you know walking with his
dog in Belarus
he's probably with your dog you know
your dog that your kid's thing died but
really went to Belarus to live the rest
of his life in for eternity he might
have one of those
well here's my theory here's my theory
about progression and if you look at the
fact that he hasn't been seen at all
I feel like there's only one
one conclusion
he's been abducted by the UFOs
now the UFOs we've also not got good
pictures of
so
that would be the perfect place for him
to hide because we just can't find the
UFOs so if he could get on a UFO
that might be the best way to stay away
from Putin plus he'd have access to all
that advanced technology
you know what's interesting
um
you know if you want to be mad at your
American government if you're American
here's another thing to be bad at
we have all of these UFOs which means by
now of course we've reversed engineered
their technology and we won't give that
technology to to Ukraine who desperately
deserves it
can you believe it we have all this
Advanced to alien technology and we
don't give any of it to zelenski we're
like no we're only going to give you
their Earthly stuff
how would you like some Earthling
weapons
and he's like Earthling weapons you're
giving me the weak stuff no I want this
stuff from Centauri Prime no no no you
can't have the stuff from said Tory
bribe no no we're saving that for us
but we've got a lot of Earthly Goods
that you know will get you all killed
but if you could have that
you could have all of it yeah that's
right the UFOs have progosian
yes they do and you know what the uh the
UFOs uh have as a weapon
do you know what their main weapon of of
the UFOs is
because we know that now
it's a secret Sonic weapon that they
mostly embassies
this is sort of the embassy secret Sonic
Centauri Prime
kind of a weapon
all right there's no real news today I'm
doing the best I can I'm doing the best
I can with a slow news day give me a
break
I saw David sacks uh throwing up a
little Caution that I guess Lindsey
Graham went over to
Ukraine and there's some kind of a red
line that's being drawn
that if uh
that there's a red line being drawn that
if Russia blows up a Ukrainian
specifically there's one in danger I
guess if they blow up a Ukrainian
Nuclear Power Plant
that although that's a red line and you
know maybe there'd be more escalation if
they do that now David Sachs points out
it looks like a false flag is being
created so first you create the red line
oh if you do this
then the United States will get more
into the war
and then the United States does this
themselves in other words like his Gulf
of Tonkin so so the thinking is that
maybe America and Ukraine
would blow up Ukraine's own power plant
that happens to be under the control of
the Russians right now uh as part of a
war strategy
I'm going to say no
I'm going to say no on that
here's what I think
I think the United States would sink a
boat
to start a war I think they do that
I think we would stage a false flag
attack
on maybe maybe a building or something
Maybe
I think we would do some pretty bad
stuff but I don't see us
bombing a nuclear power plant
does that really that really brings you
forward somehow you really get ahead if
you do that how in the world could that
be a good idea
so your golfer Tonkin is one ship goes
to the bottom of the ocean
it's clean you got your desks but
otherwise it's clean
but
destroyed a nuclear power plant
that would be the very worst idea that
anybody ever had for a false flag attack
I don't know if we'll ever see anybody
attack their own Nuclear Power Plant
that feels like something that just
can't happen like like nobody's mind
would ever go there
now if I'm wrong
well I guess I'm gonna have to say I'm
wrong
so and by the way there's a good chance
that that nuclear power plant will have
some explodey stuff happening and
there's a good chance we won't know who
did it so I think there's a very high
chance
some stuff could go down and we don't
know who did it but intentionally
intentionally
that's a stretch
it's something it's something to be
concerned about to look at and you know
it if it turns out that the Russians get
blamed for blowing that thing up you
could be very skeptical
and and to me I don't see why that's a
red line at all actually
if it's such a big problem that it would
be a red line
would we do it ourselves
I mean it just doesn't make sense
so I'm going to say that doesn't it
doesn't quite make sense I'm going to
bet against it
but keep an eye on it so I think David
Sachs is right to say keep an eye on
that
um I've noticed that when I make
predictions my best predictions are
things that don't exist
so you know I just gave you three of
them I told you that the secret of Sonic
weapon wasn't real the day it came out
so far we haven't found it and it looks
like it wasn't real right I told you
that when uh when the Vegas shooter was
called Isis
you know I said nope it's not Isis it
wasn't
when uh the UFO thing you know when
there was a credible sounding person who
says the United States has all these
UFOs
I said nope you're never going to see
proof of that
nope
and then when pergosian allegedly his
plane went to Belarus I said nope that
did not happen an evolution Evolution as
well right about that
so
um here's my
here's my uh summary of that it's way
easy to know what isn't true
so it looks like I'm doing better than I
am at predicting if you ask me to
predict what would happen that's really
hard
but predicting what is not real you know
that the news says is real it's actually
somewhat easy
yeah it's just too on the nose it's
always the same it's always the same
it's just two on the nose you could spot
it right away and by the way how many of
you are happy that you learned the two
on the nose trick
how many have just automatically you
know you can spot the fake news now just
right away wait oh let's do it in the
news
yeah it's like isn't it like a magic
sense it's almost like you got a sixth
sense
as soon as you can see the two on the
nose stuff you spot the fake news like
you have magic or something yeah it's a
really powerful technique
uh Scott predictions are all ego based
to appear smarter than you
hmm
is there something you do that isn't ego
based
like what uh because that was a real
smart comment
um that the predictions are ego based
well what would be uh I'm just curiosity
what would be something that a human
does that's not ego based
what would that be
yeah yeah it's a dumb comment
it's a dumb comment a hundred
percent what you do is for your selfish
or maybe your family or something but
that's selfish too
it's all for ego every bit of it
predictions aren't the one thing
I do for ego
everything I do is free go
because everything I do has something to
do with you know
making me more effective or useful in
the world
because it makes me feel good
it's it's all ego
getting rid of your ego feels really
good by the way if you can ever do it
it gives you a feeling of euphoria but
it doesn't last long that's why uh the
psychedelics are good
they remove your ego temporarily and the
reason it's euphoric is that it's so
it's such a relief because we're walking
around just managing our egos all day as
hard
but you're very lost if you think that
that there are some situations in which
ego counts and then the others don't
that's not the reality
all right
um
I had offered that uh
I would start up as spaces on Twitter
so if somebody somebody wanted to ask me
questions they can so I've got it all
fired up here does anybody want to go to
spaces and you can stay here and listen
to it or you can listen to it on Spaces
but I'm gonna hit start now
yeah we'll see if anybody comes in
all right everybody I don't know if
anybody's here yet but this will be your
opportunity to ask me any question so
raise your hand if you want to be a
person who asked me a question it could
be any topic
I don't care what it is
oh look all my friends are signing up
there
all right is anybody uh raise your hand
if you want to ask me a question could
be on anything it's a slow news day so
we're just sort of look at looking at a
reason to talk about something and enjoy
your coffee
if you're uh if you're sitting there
with your coffee and your dog on your
lap
well you're doing it right because
that's that's the vibe this weekend
dog on lap
all right uh I've got one request here
um that as a speaker
very curious
in a moment you will be a speaker
hey curious are you there
thanks for accepting my speaker request
pleasure what's your question
day Brothers go ahead
what do you think is happening with the
taste now
um do you think that he will be released
at any time
um or do you think he's definitely going
to prison and it's just kind of over for
him well your remedia is sort of a big
black box I don't think any of us know
what that situation is so this is the
perfect example that I always say that
the news about public figures is never
true it's just never true now I base
that on knowing lots of public figures
and also being in the news you know
hundreds if not thousands of times
myself and I can I can see the stories
about myself and I know if they're true
or not and then often there are people I
know personally so I can find out the
real story behind the scenes and this
never matches it just never matches and
not even close you usually there's at
least one fact that changes everything
and the public isn't aware of that fact
so with the Tay Brothers I would
summarize it this way
is Romania so I'd be I'd be amazed if
everything that's happening is by the
book
and you know non-corrupt
I just assume there's some corruption I
don't know how it plays into the story
but one assumes it's part of the story
then the other question is is there
somebody outside of Romania who is the
Puppet Master trying to get Romania to
clamp down on these guys I think the
odds of that are good
um I I don't have proof of that but it
seems like something that could happen
in our world
then that but the other wild card is
their their capabilities
the reason that you talk about them at
all is they're hyper capable they're
just really really capable at a wide
range of things you know social media
making money maybe maybe some sketchy
activities but they made them all work
yeah almost everything they did worked
so
assuming that they still have access to
lots of funds
um do you think they can bribe their way
out in time
and so you might have a situation where
you have the most probably two of the
most capable people in terms of
persuasion money social media and if
they can't get out of this nobody could
so there's a little bit of a Houdini
show going on which is two people in the
situation that no normal person could
get out of
but they're not normal people
they are the two people who had would
have the best chance of getting out of a
type of a tight spot
you know especially if it's complicated
and you know there's lots of levels to
it and you got to be a chess player but
they are that's exactly what they are
they are chess players so
I'm fascinated at the um competition if
you will
that you know the entire legal system of
Romania
versus the Tate Brothers Tay Brothers is
actually a fair fight
and I don't know which way it'll go it
honestly could go either way they could
be completely free and Vindicated
possibly or
the Romanians will you know get their
licks in
all right
um
does that answer your question I think
you're yeah thank you thank you very
much I just wanted to know your take on
it um but I'll let somebody else ask
some questions now thank you Scott all
right thanks
all right let's see uh
Javi
is it j j a v i is that Harvey or
Javi maybe you'll tell me Javi are you
there
yes how do you pronounce your name
it's uh Javi Javi okay Javi what is your
question
um which is your favorite conspiracy
conspiracy theory that actually turned
out to be true
uh well the I I guess the one that's
closest to me which is that Twitter was
in fact
um how does thumb on the scale in a
variety of ways that we still haven't
figured out
so
it always felt like it was true
and then to find that it was true was
pretty good the uh
the idea that the Democrats were behind
the Russia collusion
it took me a while to realize that that
didn't happen sort of organically
you know that there was actually just a
plot it was exactly what you thought it
was so I think musk accurately said that
it seems like all of our
all of our conspiracy theories are
coming out to be true
uh oh and on you believe everything
no my ex-wife did not hook up with
Andrew Tate
I don't know if you know this but Andrew
Tate is not reliable in terms of the
truth
all right uh
did I answer your question
I think you muted so I'm going to say
yes yes
thank you all right thanks
all right let's try somebody else here
uh Robert
all right Robert let's see if you're
ready to get on here and ask me a
question Robert
hello Robert Robert
there's a little delay with the
interface so it just it's trying to
connect but there he is
no not yet it's weird it's it's cooking
like it can't connect
so it's not Robert's fault his
technology is not working all right
well that's that's where it is still not
working
I might have to
undo that one and try somebody else
oh Ed is a speaker
all right we're having a user interface
glitch I can't add this speaker and I
can't subtract them but what happens if
I try to add somebody else
all right I'm going to try to add
somebody else
Chris
you may have successfully been added if
you unmute your microphone Chris you can
ask me a question hey Chris okay I will
I will say there's like a five second
delay
in these spaces from the the people that
are up on the stage are like five
seconds ahead of the people that are
just listening oh hmm okay
you know if you're bringing people up
one at a time like you are that that
you're going to get that my question to
you is you said something that uh rang
very true with me a 2020 election
was
non-transparent by force
and you know therefore it was
illegitimate uh I was wondering if you
might expand on that a bit
uh so that other people can understand
it because I think that very simple
thing
uh proves quite a bit right there well
by non-transparent by force I think
you're referring to one situation where
Republican observers were denied access
there were multiple but yes yeah well
you know that allows you to doubt the
election
um so I don't care what anybody tells
you did or did not happen if if you have
a right to watch and they tell you you
can't you should draw exactly the
conclusion from that
that an informed person should that
there's something going on
because if there wasn't anything going
on well maybe they'd let you see now the
the counter to that is that they're just
worried that The Observers would be
troublemakers and they were just trying
to make their life easier
Maybe
that's entirely possible
um but you can't have that situation and
also have confidence
you can have irregularities and then no
confidence but you can't have
irregularities and then confidence
uh you gotta pick so if you're gonna go
with your regularities don't ask for the
confidence and the result we can't give
you that that's logically incompatible
so I don't I don't have any evidence
that the
election was rigged
zero evidence of that that I'm aware of
uh there are lots of claims but if you
were to track all of the claims from the
beginning of the election denial claims
they're almost all wrong
now will there be some that you know pan
out I don't know maybe
anything's possible but like I always
say the the big picture is this
if you have a system that is not fully
auditable
and people have a really big incentive
to to game the system they will
yeah maybe not maybe not 2020. but
eventually
you know there's no way you can avoid it
so we have a system that attracts and
guarantees rigging I would say it
guarantees it it's designed to attract
it and guarantee it in the long run if
it were designed to avoid it it would be
designed very differently
I imagine
so that's what I think all right thanks
Chris
all right let's bring up
spring up Christopher Hill
so it'll be a little five second delay
or so all right Christopher if you
unmute
you can you can talk
skill stack regarding communication
persuasion skills and that clearly had a
lot to do with him Rising above the pack
and getting into the White House so I
guess the question is this as you look
at 2024 how much of an impact will
that's that persuasion skill sack take
or do you think that there are other
aspects of his skills that may may make
it different to 24 is it just completely
different environment
well the big question uh that's being
asked on the right is whether the
elections are designed so that the
Republican could ever win
and I don't know the answer to that I
don't know it could be that you know
between the the legal manipulations and
the ballot stuffing that persuasion just
doesn't matter anymore it could be just
who's running the better game on the
ground so it might be that it doesn't
matter the thing that was different
about Trump is that he was bringing a
new weapon into the field that nobody
recognized yeah but you know I could see
it early so that was a very special case
it's not it's not some kind of thing
where I could always guess who the next
president is going to be that was just a
one-off I just had a special uh sort of
a special Vision on a specific variable
that was gigantic and was invisible to
other people
so uh
I would think that
the first thing that's happening is that
with the little primary action going on
in the Republican side
that the best ideas are starting to be
grabbed by all the candidates
so you saw that I think most of the
candidates said they would get tough
with the military with the cartels
it's because when Trump said it
everybody said oh he got a good reaction
to that all right I guess I got to do
that too so I think you're saying um
there's going to be a lot of people
joining the best opinion
some of those best opinions were going
to come from Vivek ramaswamy and people
will probably have to just adopt them
so I I think uh I think yeah it's a
different landscape I don't think just
the a super persuasive person coming
could come in and tear things up now RFK
Jr is super persuasive uh Vivek is super
persuasive Trump is super persuasive and
I do think that they're going to move
move the uh I think those are the three
that will move the conversation the most
and already have
already have thanks for the question
all right let's take another one
uh all right uh Ronin listen you have a
good name so I'll add you
Ronan this is you connect
uh unmute your microphone and you can
ask me a question hello Ronan
hi Scott
full ask me anything
can I ask for your personal take on
bitcoin and do you hold any Bitcoin
personal takeout Bitcoin first of all
yes I hold Bitcoin
um I believe Bitcoin is a hundred
percent unpredictable
meaning that
um you don't know what the government's
going to do
and you probably never will
so you got that government risk that
hangs over it however having said that
I've recommended before that if you have
something like a portfolio
then you know maybe if you want five
percent of it to be in Bitcoin that
makes sense so I would use Bitcoin as a
diversification tool not as a singular
investment tool
that said there will be people who do
exactly the opposite of my advice and
make huge fortunes
there will be others who do the opposite
of my advice and lose huge fortunes
probably depending on their timing so
Bitcoin is a diversification play for
somebody with a normal portfolio if
you're young
if you're 25 you get a you've saved up
five thousand dollars and you just want
to like throw a bat down maybe
maybe you might get a you know you might
get a 50 gain one year and be happy you
did so if you're young and you can
absorb a small loss get a little more
aggressive I'm giving you basically the
most common
um investment advice there is right so
quick yeah
I used to be with a gentleman
strategy are you familiar with happening
I'm familiar with him yes
[Music]
talks uh one particular talk called the
Sailor Breedlove series it's very
long-winded uh it's probably a 20-part
series each part's two hours so it's not
an easy watch but it's absolutely
um fantastic but but doesn't it come
down to this so Bitcoin would do great
except for two risks one is the
government risk which cannot be
predicted and the other is a technology
risk which is either somebody can crack
it or somebody can come up with a a
better Bitcoin then everybody says oh
why would I use Bitcoin when this is so
much better so I think those two things
make Bitcoin not normal investment
I'm probably not eloquent enough to
delve in and give the crap answer but
those two questions there are definitely
very good answers as to why
there are reasons that these they're not
as much of a fundamental risk
um well okay without without hearing the
argument it's hard to debate it but but
I'll just say this I'm not going to
believe anybody who says government is
predictable or technology is predictable
yeah there's nothing you could tell me
that would change my mind on that
but anyway so so thanks for the question
and I'm going to move on appreciate it
nice to meet you thank you all right
thank you
let's do another one here
the fool would like to come on
this sounds dangerous all right fool
calls himself a fool
uh
um it looks like we got a technology
problem on that one oh unmute your uh
microphone fool and ask me your question
hey Scott you hear me yes again what's
your question
on fentanyl right
uh yes this year correct so I think in
Prior YouTubes or podcasts or spaces or
whatever you said you haven't like used
your entire I would say persuasive
ability
is that still a thing
on Sentinel
yeah well the the entire Republican
primary group wants to militarily attack
the cartels so
I think maybe I'm doing okay
is are you doing it on purpose are you
using your force all right uh yes yes
okay
okay
let's say I'm a
I'm a state voter on the transitioning
of children okay which I view as like an
object objective evil okay
um following I would say
um
I was going to see if you want to join
teams vice versa basically no uh
if you wanted to switch over to the
transitioning of children no I'm going
with the numbers I don't know how many
kids transition I I would I would agree
with you on you know kids maybe waiting
until they're adults so no argument on
the issue
but
um you can't make your single issue to
issues
and and also if you want to join your
team no I know um I'm saying I don't
want to go from the big team to the
small team how many people do you how
many kids I think it's a bigger issue
how many kids do you think uh transition
per year
oh but give me one that's one too many
is it more than the 70 000 dying from
fentanyl every year
my guess is probably
objective evil where I see the
transitioning of children and as an
objective evil maybe
okay they're trying to make money from
well I I uh I don't believe in objective
evil
um I believe in Saving as many people
and you know keeping our lives good and
keeping us safe and happy and stuff
so objective evil is a sort of a frame
it's more of a point of view
but uh that's my persuasion Point yeah
but it doesn't work on me so I don't I
don't believe in evil and Free Will and
stuff like that but thanks all right
thanks for the question
all right thanks
yeah I don't I don't believe in evil
uh and I guess I guess the reason I
don't believe it is that it doesn't have
a a use
there's no usefulness for that frame
there are things that you know you want
to stop and there are things you know
you want more of
that's the end of it
there's stuff you want more of there's
stuff you want less of there's you don't
need to give any extra words on it
there's stuff you know people doing bad
things
people do bad things
sure all right let's take another one
Chris
um
Chris as soon as your microphone shows
up here hey Chris uh on you unmute your
microphone and ask me your question
hey Scott
hi Chris
um
the last question at I have a
five-year-old and a seven year old
what's your typical in the future of
education and like colleges in the
future do you think we'll exist still
a few big ones the future colleges well
I feel like
um
it's it's going to change I mean
everybody can say the obvious it's just
not going to look the same in 10 years
the teachers union still has a solid
grip so I think it comes down to money
if there's enough money to build
alternative school choice then it's
going to happen like crazy
because I think almost everybody wants
the school choice at this point if
they're really paying attention
so if money becomes available it's going
to happen like crazy
and
oh
yeah I feel like
there's going to be more of a learning
specific skills and putting together a
skill stack than universities
I I think that the cost and the benefit
of the college education is largely
debunked at this point
in the sense that you know if you if you
could afford
let's say your parents could afford to
pay for your college totally
it would be a nice four years of meeting
people and maybe getting a little more
mature and you know learning some skills
would be useful but I feel like there's
going to be tons of people
who don't want to spend that money
you don't have the extra money to spend
and can just directly learn the things
they need for a practical successful
life so I think the AI is going to be
the teacher for more and more people
until it's the only teacher you know
I've often said that the problem with
remote learning is that all they did is
put a camera in front of a regular
teacher
that's like the dumbest thing yeah
exactly you're not getting it back right
you should start from scratch and say
what does this new technology do that
the old one won't and one thing it does
is you could put together a team of
teachers for one course
so you can say hey I've got a I've got a
graphics expert who's going to really
make this come alive visually I've got
somebody who's really good at engaging a
crowd you know somebody's just good at
talking in front of people and people
want to watch that person maybe they're
good looking too and then you know
somebody to write the plan so it's
compatible with you know what your
future needs are and it's it's just the
right lessons but you would put a team
together including maybe a director and
a producer you know almost a Hollywood
model and then you compete with the
other little clips of you know AI is
teaching other things and you just let
the market decide which is the right one
so so my my general take is that online
learning or Computer Learning is worse
than 80 percent of in-person learning
but the very best which has not been
created yet the very best online AI
teacher will be 10 times better than the
best human experience but we're not
there yet
so I think universities will maybe the
exception of the norm of academic
instructor I think the university is
just going to become rich people clubs
you know just maybe maybe a place to get
some networking going but not
necessarily proving that you can code
better
yeah I would still be around as a as a
social club basically that that says
you're in the club now they uh Harvard's
on the way to destroying their biggest
asset because if if they're uh if
they're enrolling people who are not
coming from wealthy families
which they're trying to do at a bigger
that's a great good in many ways you
know a lot lots of positive but you
you're going to be networking with
somebody who had a single mom and grew
up in a poor City
so so you have access to network with
the one person the other your classmate
who might be awesome might become a
billionaire but but you lose the access
to that one person's family
which could have also been you know very
connected as well so so Harvard's uh
networking value should be you know
dropping precipitously
all right all right thanks
all right how are we doing uh are people
enjoying this
do you want more of this
all right a little more of this all
right
uh let's see Adam
's a good name
So Adam you're going to be connected
here and unmute your speaker and ask
your question on your microphone
Adam I can't hear you
Adam might have a microphone problem all
right so that didn't work
let's try Patrick
you look interesting
unmute yours your microphone
Patrick
hey here I am hey what's your question
Patrick
um I I have a question before someone is
to say I saw Greg gutfield on here and I
wanted to encourage everybody to read
his book The plus it's basically you can
be a plus or minus in the world with
every decision you make and uh it's a
really really great book
um my question is I remember listening
to your podcast way back when in early
2020 and you you were talking about how
the the media had taken this stance
against hydroxychloroquine and you know
what kind of a risk they were doing if
it worked and uh now that uh
now that everything's turned out the way
it is you know I feel like them
suppressing hydroxychloroquine at the
time that they did basically destroyed
the world and um so as I think the
accountability should be first for that
so Patrick in your reality
yeah it seems it seems we're all in our
own little realities and your reality
has hydroxychloroquine been shown to be
effective
um and safe for uh covid I use the
zelenco protocol when I got coveted in
no no anecdotes no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no I'm
not going to listen to an anecdote I'm
not going to hear about one patient you
have to answer the question do you think
that science
has proven the hydroxychloroquine worked
no anecdotes
that it's a crime against humanity that
they uh they are are still denying it
but but your opinion is based entirely
upon your certainty that it does work
that's true okay yeah I I mean I wish I
could join you uh I do have
um
appreciation for what RFK Jr and others
say that it almost looks like the tests
were designed to fail
absolutely they were yeah yeah but but I
but I suspect that if I were to talk to
the people who put those tests together
they would change my mind
you know I haven't done that but the the
problem is every time you hear one side
of anything it sounds convincing right
yeah so so when somebody says I looked
at that study and the the amounts are
too high and was obviously designed to
fail and it was not matched with zinc
and all these things and they sound true
or given to people late I I remember
giving late right right yeah so I
remember okay all of those things uh
they sound like reasonably good points
but I haven't heard the Counterpoint I
haven't heard the people who ran the
test say yes I know why you're asking
the questions but there's actually a
good reason for it here's why we did it
maybe it would be convincing I don't
know so for me it's a big uh I don't
know
yeah but I wouldn't rule it out I
wouldn't rule it out
I think that it being an Iona for for
zinc and zinc
stops their application of the virus the
better question was how how did it not
work and and one thing another thing I
heard you say that I wish people pursued
on is that is there anybody who used it
correctly early and died anyway and you
would think that there were those those
would have been advertised all over the
place I thought it was I thought I did
hear some of those but I may have been
wrong there were so many anecdotal
reports that they'll run together in my
mind but one of the things I was
watching was to see if there was any
location that completely solved their
problem with hydroxychloroquine you know
I thought there'd be some you know City
in I don't know South America or
something whether it be somebody who
just won you know Hog Wild and and just
eliminated their problems so I expected
to see that now Africa sometimes used as
an example but what percentage of
Africans do you think are actually
taking hydroxychloroquine it's not a big
percentage it's just they used a lot
there but not as a percentage of the
people
no I know it's a lot as a quantity but
not as a percentage
right so anyway okay
um but thanks for the question Patrick
sure right
um
all right
um how about let's listen to uh Dr Hank
we got a doctor in here
he said what kind of doctor ob-g-y-n all
right
Dr Hank as soon as you connect uh turn
off your microphone and ask your
question
Dr Hank are you there
oh sorry I
utterly just putting
[Laughter]
pretty space thank you all right
I uh I just came in so I don't know what
the conversation has been
um I just got in you know I'm a I'm a
physician who four years ago was a
certain kind of physician and kovid has
totally in my opinion ripped my blinders
off and you know the topics could take
all day to go through but you know one
perfect example you just mentioned the
hydroxychloroquine when I when covet
started I'm what's called a Locum tenum
doctor so I travel all around the
country and
um when covet started I was well hold on
hold on hold on you're traveling
gynecologist
yes
okay it's it's called Locum cannams it's
basically you know you do assignments to
fill in spots all around the country
yeah I've been doing it full time for
eight years my wife and dogs and I just
are full-time gypsies now I've been
doing that too but apparently I need
some kind of certification you're
telling me
no I'm just kidding just kidding just
kidding all right go ahead go ahead with
your question
well anyways
um again I'm kind of forcing the topic I
don't know really what you want to talk
about whatever you want whatever you
want go ahead okay whatever since you
brought up hydroxy so when I during
covet I've worked in six different
hospitals in four different states I
started in Washington outside of Seattle
and if you remember the nursing home
Kirkland nursing home north of Seattle
was kind of the initial hot spot in the
U.S and I was in this little Hospital
across the Puget Sound and we were
having meetings about putting up tents
in the parking lot with patient beds and
cots
because you know we believed the initial
rhetoric that this was going to be a
massive
um undertaking that there were going to
be corpses in the street and that
Seattle would fill up immediately so we
wouldn't be able to fly patients to
Seattle which is their normal custom
there and I had also done missionary
work in Africa and had been taken
hydroxy for years for malarial
prophylaxis so I was very familiar with
it and I was heavy on I've been on heavy
on Twitter for about the last eight or
nine years and I was immediately
connected with intensivists in Seattle
and in New York City and right away
those guys were talking about fauci's
own paper in 2015 talking about hydroxy
is a great prophylaxis for SARS one and
the couple biochemists came on and physi
microbiologists started talking about
the mechanism which the other guy
mentioned it being an ionophore and zinc
has
Etc and then I very quickly learned
about vitamin D3 to make a long story
short I got on that stuff right away you
know I was very attentive to it and the
day that the music died so to speak if
you follow my uh Don McLean reference
was when Trump trump mentioned it and
immediately it was uh basically turned
into a you know Pariah I mean I had just
built a prescription at a local pharmacy
a couple days before and I called them
after that statement and they're like
we're no longer doing it and you know
I'm an old fart I'm 63 and so I've been
practicing since the mid 90s and that's
never happened in American medicine
before where pharmacists or politicians
tell doctors what they can or can't do
with a approved medication
so yeah things just got worse you know
did you have a question for me
into these studies there are tons of
studies no I'm not no I'm not sincere
about that at all so you're here's the
problem I don't believe any studies
well it yeah and you know that's a true
statement to a large degree I mean that
is part of the problem I mean you know
one of the things that I was not aware
of before which is kind of a fundamental
thing that I'm presuming as an informed
person you're aware of and that is how
much of the regulatory agencies are
actually paid for by the regulated oh
yeah I mean oh I'm quite aware of that
yes yeah no that starts that starts
always starts the discussion for people
with me is that if if you start with
that Financial component that has to
create a um you know
exactly what we saw glasses to look
through right yeah exactly what we saw
yeah so thanks thanks for the comments
doctor
okay I'm gonna make some comments after
but thanks for joining yep
yeah I would say you know the one thing
you could say about the whole coven
situation is that follow the money
worked again
right
follow the money explain to 100 of what
you saw every better there wasn't one
thing that wasn't explained by follow
the money
so
so there we are all right let's uh try
Neely
co-founder and CEO of distill Professor
okay you look in an econ nerds so you
look interesting
all right Neely as soon as you connect
unmute your microphone there you go hi
Neely do you have a question
or uh personal okay thank you you said
anything yeah anything's good okay
when you draw do you listen to music
and if you do what are you listening to
ah uh the answer is no I don't listen to
music
when I draw I've I've already done the
thinking so the writing has already
happened so I can't listen to anything
when I'm writing I asked to be quiet
when I draw I do like new annoys the
ideal noise would be people
so if I'm sitting in Starbucks I want to
hear people sound or there's somebody in
the house you know just even if they're
just working or something just somebody
around and then I do like to watch you
know a show or the news or a YouTube or
something so I do like to have some kind
of entertainment on was there a deeper
part of that question
curious I was like you um I've always
been a fan of obviously of your work as
like millions and zillions of people are
and I love listening and learning about
how people do their craft you know for
the people who do
excellence and um I just thought here's
an opportunity to ask you I will also
say thank you you retweeted one of my
tweets on the economy once and it was
the most Bonkers day I've ever had in
Twitter with the notifications so
um also thank you thanks for answering
my question all right you're welcome
thanks for the question
all right
that was an easy one I like talking
about myself I know I know all the
answers what I'm talking about myself
all right Paul
all right Music Arts
he's a mass formation disrespector and a
confirm propaganda confronter all right
I'm adding you as a speaker Paul
as soon as your microphone is off hey
there you are hi Paul hi how you doing
hi Scott thanks for taking the call yeah
what's your question
[Music]
Benjamin
Owen Benjamin uh the name is familiar
I don't know where where are you going
with this
uh I just I don't know if you're aware
of him I don't see you guys interact on
Twitter I didn't know if you were
familiar with his work or not
um but why why are you asking about him
in particular
what's the connection
uh I'm a fan of both of your works just
you know just uh being able to say the
emperor has no clothes and say things
that uh might be uh unpopular at the
time but are true
ah okay all right
um I'm not trying to draw any
conclusions from that that's all I'm I
just was curious all right all right
thanks for the question Paul
all right let's uh let's hear from I
probably won't pick anybody who doesn't
have a profile picture
so I like this uh brunella is a rebel
likes wildflowers and cracking concrete
perfect
brunella
turn off your mute and ask me a question
hello
no I haven't hi nice to meet you I have
a strong question from Europe from
Berlin who is owning black rocks
and why how can be possible that the
same reords fake lutein Revolution and
all this type stuff that is happening in
the United States is now in France and
they're gonna bring it all over Europe
and
what's your idea about all this
happening thank you did you think that
was caused by a BlackRock was that the
question
I didn't say that
no I I just would like to know is Black
Rock
we know the Vanguard the own BlackRock
and BlackRock on Vanguard the problem is
that there is really the hair going on
in Europe and I'm sure that this is all
over guys and at the moment I cannot
tweet I don't know why but I can go in
spaces and they're not answering to me
why we have a different contract of
Twitter in Europe respect to other
countries and I think they're trying to
silence us very badly so we're trying to
fight to see really what's going on so
we use the space to have these answers
and we all know that I don't know if
you've never had a chance to see
Monopoly the video
it's really interesting I showed up all
behind these things we zoning really
everything is actually black rocks and
now we are trying just to find out
what the heck is happening guys because
BlackRock is only North Russia so what's
the game you know well well
um I'll take my best shot at that
question thank you so much
I'd be surprised if BlackRock had
anything to do with the riots per se
um I don't see the connection there but
um it seems like the riots in Europe are
just immigration related there's no
mystery there is there
and that's that's
something that people should know and we
try to share this message guys
know about immigrant at all is really
the full population that is upset they
arrest 3 000 people almost about what
what is the issue I thought the people
who were actually burning things are the
immigrants are they not
well they're using immigrants as a tool
you know because of course they don't
want to show that the people are against
what's they're taking all our rights
away one by one very slowly and it
starts of course with a pension and
start with the yellow vest they're
taking the Farmland away the you know
what's happening with the energy guys uh
we don't have in Germany energy anymore
so the the companies are closing down
people start to fight for their rights
but they want to play the game of giving
the fall to the immigration that's why
they let so much people leave Africa and
go all over Europe and create this kind
of fake emergency with the immigrants
the truth is that they want to play this
card to cheat to to fake the fact that
the people are making Revolt from there
to the militarization is already
happening in France in Paris there are
more than 14
000 people and they are beating everyone
um
who's doing all these evil plans is that
the government's working with BlackRock
or do you think BlackRock is doing it on
its own yeah the problem is that in
Europe we don't have any more area
leader all our leaders Chuck Maloney
check shows such check all the others
they get they get elected by promising
to go against this and as soon as they
were elected they turned completely and
they keep on following the same orders
so what do you think what do you think
is uh behind it all
well it will be easy to say you know
very often we say of course because we
know that we have a lot of
people from U.S you know we have
military bases all over Europe so of
course it's easy for us to say that
there is a lot of you know infiltration
also in every institution and so on we
know that it's happened and is real but
the truth is that we see what's
happening in America so we know that
also there is happening the same that
means that there is a big Power with a
lot of money this is pretty clear if you
watch if you had the chance I will
invite the people to see monopolies now
my brother nothing at all but I find
some answer really important answer
there about the fact that there is these
two only two corporations that no own
everything in the planet but but do you
don't you think the corporations want
um capitalism and prosperity
because that's what benefits them
[Music]
from Humanity seems that they even
decide to start the population my point
of view it's real I don't know that my
my take is that it's unrelated they're
either unrelated or barely related
events there's just a lot of stuff is
happening some of it is just excess
energy after the after the pandemic I
always assumed that there would be some
release of energy that had been you know
tamped down too long and it would sort
of look like this so I feel like there's
a big upheaval that just had to happen
but it's just coming out of a lot of
different windows and doors and for
different reasons just too much energy I
don't see that there's any large
corporate entity
who's whose well-being depends on a
stable world with lots of people buying
stuff
I can't see them wanting to cause
instability so capitalists almost always
wants stability over instability so if
somebody is creating instability that
would only make sense for a specific
industry such as defense which I do
think happens I do think the defense
industry creates an instability to sell
sell weapons but outside of the defense
industry I can't see BlackRock wanting
instability that would be outside of
every economic
understanding in the world
but thanks for the comments
thank you
all right how about one more
one more yeah for that
let's get Kathleen she's got a cat for a
picture
Kathleen
you were being selected because your
your profile picture is a cat
what's your question Kathleen
I'm good thanks what's your question for
me
I have a question regarding your one as
a statement and that you're such a
pillar of light
um in this crazy world that we're in and
you're really on to
um food being linked to a lot of the
problems that we have in our world today
and my question is is have you ever
heard of the western A price foundation
no
my next question will be will you ever
check it out I I I I was thinking there
might be some kind of follow-up to that
so the the answer so far is no I'm not
going to follow up because you've given
you've given me no reason to follow up
what it what is it why do I care about
it
well they do they tell you the truth
about food and uh there was a dentist
back in the 30s and he self-funded a
study his name was Weston West in a
price that's the foundation name he's
helped funded a study where he uh went
into 14 different cultures that were
remote from modern day living and found
uh he he was a dentist and he his
patients were
experiencing all kinds of health
problems whether it be cancer or bad
dental problems and uh you know just a
lot of health health problems and so he
did some research and found over a
10-year period that
there were common denominators not all
the same but that they had traditional
food preparation and fermentation and
you know I I think we're well beyond the
point where we need to prove it it
seemed like a hundred percent of every
study ever done shows that our current
food source is bad for us and you know
there's there's better ways to eat so uh
yeah I think I'm so sold on that point
of view that extra extra selling isn't
necessary in my case but that might be
something that other people are
interested in so thanks for the call
Kathleen hey thanks for taking my call
all right I appreciate it
we're gonna do for today
I think we've done it all
deep dive in this you'll be pleasantly
surprised
um Michael schellenberger did a
is it on video that might be interested
I'm like a parent to you
how old are you
I'm old enough to be most of your
parents
all right I'm going to turn off uh
spaces thanks for joining
all right
yo it's interesting how many
um well
I'm not going to go there did anybody
have the the feeling that the last thing
you wanted to talk about is covid
like it just it just hurts at this point
it's just painful isn't it
because there's nothing left to say
there's just nothing left to say
tomorrow somebody's gonna say oh there's
my new study that the shots killed you
dead
and then the day later it'll be another
one that says the opposite and we don't
we won't know anything so
um can you remind me the name Eric
Dyson what's his name
the scientists
the era is it Eric why I have part of
his name wrong right he's a three
Freeman wait what's his name
no Dyson Dyson
Neil Degrassi Dyson right
Tyson Degrassi well okay why can't we
get his name right I don't know why this
is why is this happening you all know
his name and you're telling me like
Michael Eric all right somebody somebody
Neil Degrassi Tyson all right thank you
so he was on yesterday and he was
talking to Erica who's the who's the
podcaster you keep telling me to pay
attention to
Medi or somebody what's the name of his
um Erica
who do you keep telling Hassan
you know the podcaster you you sent to
me
all right
Maddie is on I think that's correct so
many Assad had a podcast with
um
foreign
why can't I remember his name there's
something weird about his name that
makes it impossible to remember for me
anyway so here's
here's what's interesting about that I
was listening to it yesterday as I was
floating in my pool
and the conversation was about
um you know the pandemic and the
vaccinations and stuff and I thought
that uh
that
whoever he is I'm going to say the
scientist on The podcaster okay let me
confess I don't know both of their names
correctly and I'm not going to learn it
here
so one of them is a scientist there's a
podcaster you know who I'm talking about
but uh the scientist uh
I thought gave the podcaster a good
spanking on the
um the benefits of the vaccination this
is not me speaking this is not me
how many of you how many of you think I
just gave you my opinion didn't happen
there were no opinions here I'm saying
that as a debate
uh Tyson one hard
and it was very interesting I'll tell
you I'll tell you where the holes were
that he pushed through
number one is you know why would you
take a experimental vaccination
and then Tyson would say
experimental it was tested
and then the podcaster would say it
wasn't tested
and then he would say it was tested
it was definitely tested and then the
podcast would say but
you know how do you know if you tested
it for nine months how do you know that
in five years you're not going to get a
problem
and then the scientist says
well that's that's actually a risk yes
you but how do you know you wouldn't get
a long coveted or how do you know that
the virus itself wouldn't give you a
problem in five years so watching
watching them
fill in each other's holes of logic here
was actually really interesting now of
course there's no conclusion so when I
say that the scientist won the argument
um
I'm saying that he didn't say anything
that's not you know logical and smart so
here let me give you his argument
um so the podcaster says
the vaccinations did not stop the
transmission do you know what the answer
to that is the vaccinations did not stop
the transmission which we all know to be
true
but do you know what the response is how
many of you know what the response to
that is just even know what they say in
response to they being the scientists do
you know
here's the response
that
when the original the original virus was
out there the original vaccination did
in fact stop its transmission
but that lasted you know like no time at
all because it because it mutated
so when Tyson says they told you it
would stop the transmission they were
right
for a while but that while didn't last
long
is he wrong
he's probably I don't think he's wrong
I think it did stop if you had the exact
shot with the exact variant it would
stop it cold but that didn't last
so both of them had trouble accepting
the other's point which is sort of what
I say
I I see people having trouble saying it
totally worked for 10 minutes
people want to say it didn't work or
they wouldn't say it worked Tyson's the
only one who says it accurately it
totally worked for 10 minutes
and it worked a little bit for the next
variant but not much
and then after that it was useless
so
I believe that's the accurate answer
it worked perfectly for 10 minutes
but it's also true that everybody knew
it would only last 10 minutes
yeah I'm exaggerating with the 10
minutes
yeah then the and then the other part
that Tyson got right is that you're not
just taking an experimental vaccination
you're taking a chance of the
vaccination that was designed to help
you versus a virus that was actually
designed to hurt you
who knows which of those is more
dangerous I don't
don't know it all
so anyway so I thought he did a real
good job of explaining that stuff
um then the part that he didn't do well
on
is Tyson was saying uh oh so so the
podcaster says what about this
documentary
of all these young athletes dropping
dead
Tyson was not aware that that's not true
that that's been widely debunked just
the data is bad
but the podcaster got to present that to
the public like it was true
now here's what Tyson said even if it is
true which was a mistake because it was
very untrue he said even if it is true
let's say 10 10 000 people dropped dead
from the shot
but they think it saved 10 million
and here's what the podcasters should
have said but didn't
you already know where this is going
right here's where that should have gone
the podcaster should have said
but the people the people under a
certain age had basically zero risk
but the vaccination was a risk
so he should have bifurcated it and said
whoa whoa the old people maybe young
people it's a whole different situation
so the the trouble is everybody's this
is a Greg Gutfeld thing you know the
prison of two ideas if you're sold that
the vaccinations work
or you're sold that they didn't work at
all it's just so hard for you to say
that the other side is a little bit
right it's just so hard
but you should
yeah it's definitely a little bit right
that we don't know the five-year
implications of the shots right it's
definitely a little bit right or 100
right
and it's a hundred percent right that
you don't know what the risk of the
covet itself and you hope that maybe the
shot in some cases reduced your chance
of long covet but you don't know there's
no way to know even if it's real long
covet all right that's all for now bye
