foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
possibly aliens it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and there's never been a
better time
and we got news for you like news all
over the place you can be saturated with
funny absurd news it's the best kind and
if you'd like that experience to go to
levels that well people say can never be
matched all you need is a copper mugger
a glass of tanker Jellison style and a
canteen jugular flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
heaven today the thing that makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous
now go
oh
well
if you're on Twitter you should know
that I just just now tweeted
a clip of me from my man cave
explaining how to predict the future of
the news
using nothing but a Tim pool hat
right and your finger you'll need a
finger and a Tim pool hat and you too
can predict the future of the news I
just tweeted that if you want to see it
but don't leave don't leave stay here
down later
you can go look for that
all right uh
apparently uh mayor Jacob fry or Frey in
Minneapolis he was telling the police to
not arrest people who have mushrooms
and I guess everybody is realizing that
mushrooms are going to save the world
they're going to fix all your mental
illnesses and make you happy
so uh that's a little sign of goodness
we're good we're gonna ease into the
hard news
because we got some hard news
and by heart I mean funny
but it's still hard hard and funny
I've been described that way but that's
another story don't let's not talk about
that
um
so what else we got going on uh
in Wall Street Journal James McIntosh an
opinion piece says well is his opinion I
guess it's spinning that China's Lost
decade for investors has already
happened
and hopes for a post-pandemic reopening
and a rapid economic recovery are
looking bad
so
turns out that investing in China is
looking like a bad idea
you're welcome
well you know that uh product that's
competing with Twitter is called threads
I I don't know if anybody said this yet
but I'd like to be the first
you know that product threads
I think it's coming unraveled
thank you thank you thank you
thank you yeah it's coming unraveled I'm
pretty sure somebody already said that
but I didn't say yet so
there's that so I guess engagement is
just tanking and it's looking terrible
and all the all the time spent ever
basically every metric is in the toilet
big time now as I said before that
doesn't really mean it's dead
that just means that the big launch
was sort of not typical of a launch so
they got a bunch of people but they
weren't really people who were
necessarily going to stick around
so you shouldn't be surprised if it got
a big bump and then went down 70 percent
then maybe it grows from there Maybe
I mean Zuckerberg has the resources to
keep it you know chunking away until it
gets better
so we'll see
also in the Wall Street Journal uh
there's an article that says some
activities people associate with
happiness
you'll be surprised but things people
associate with happiness like meditating
working out and spending time in nature
lack scientific evidence to prove they
lift your spirit
so all of the hundreds of millions of
people who have found immediate
Improvement in their moods from
meditating working out and spending time
in nature I think you should be a little
less happy about it from now on
because according to the Wall Street
Journal
you don't have the scientific backing
for your happiness so if you go for a
run and then you find that your mood is
instantly improved
probably just an illusion
get back to your scientific roots and be
skeptical you probably are still angry
and if you meditate
and you feel great when you're done
could be an illusion it might be an
illusion science needs to weigh in are
you really happier are you pretending
that you're happier and you just fool
yourself
and then of course walking in nature
you've all had the experience of uh
walking in nature and it just pisses you
off am I right
you'll be in an average mood you take a
walk in nature you're like ah screw this
nature it's pissing me off
you'll be in a bad mood so what I think
is we should take our limited money for
science
and we should put a lot of it into
testing the most obvious things
in the world
or you can just go for a run
and you'll feel good promise
all right just to cause trouble uh
there's a there's a new service I don't
know where it is because I didn't care
but there's new service that's
advertising that they'll provide you
with handy workers and not a handyman ah
no no no
no handyman these are handy workers and
they advertise that they will all be
female well I think 90 of them will be
female lesbian and trans
so if you want handy workers
or a female lesbian and trans
only
you can call this company who's a name I
don't know and I don't know where
they're from but good luck if you can
find them
um I just have a few things to say about
that
um and none of them are productive
if you know what I mean
now I say this before I give you my joke
portion of the story
I love the lgbtq community
there's no such thing as like I was
walking through an LGBT community of
high crime
all right is there even one high crime
neighborhood of lgbtq people none
basically none one of my favorite one of
my favorite groups in America
because they do a good job basically
but anyway
I cannot help weighing in on the humor
of this topic
if you'll forgive me
I wondered what would happen if you
called them and asked for a handiworker
but specified that you would only accept
a trans
and they'd say we've we've got a woman
we can but a woman is good and maybe
maybe this would be a woman but I really
need trans
I really need a trans and they say we
also have a lesbian
we could send the lesbian right over and
say lesbian is great that's great but
lesbian feels a little 1990s
can I say that it feels a little dated
I mean I need something with a little
more a little more Edge
can you give me a trans
and then they're going to say
which direction
[Laughter]
and then everything goes off the rails
at that point which kind of Trance yeah
it all gets bad after that
but the funniest sexist comment that I
saw was from on Twitter somebody named
it Mike
and my Mike said
this is so sexist it's hilarious all
right if we could just if we could just
be
you're like human for a moment and just
and just enjoy what a what a dick
comment this is
It's funny because he's being a dick all
right so so if you know that then then I
think you can do it so Mike says don't
know I feel like I would want to pay to
see that circus
after making sure after making sure they
are insured haha I would even bring out
the popcorn maker I
don't Mike you're such a dick
oh I disavow you so so hard
all right well
while we're on the topic
[Laughter]
as long as we're being offensive
let's let's do a little bit more shall
we
all right today I learned on Twitter
from uh Twitter user a fisher king
he tweeted did you know that did you
know they just had the woman's
did you know they just had the Women's
World Chess Championship
the fisher king says neither did anyone
else and he says ask yourself why
there's even such a thing it's not
tennis or MMA
is it just me or is it hilarious that
there's a woman's only chest
well is that in case nobody can't move
the pieces it's like all right uh I'll
get a move uh
Pawn too
can you help me move this chess piece
over here uh I need a little more muscle
on this ah
anyway uh meanwhile uh while we watch
the uh hilarious death of wokeness all
over DeSantis uh said he's kneecapping
ESG in Florida
and he's going after I guess there's
some uh
so the parent company for Bud Light we
all know the Bud Light story
I guess there's some Governor there's
some Florida entity that still has an
investment in them so he's trying to cut
that out
but his kneecapping the ESG
so
there's that so at the same time he's
kneecapping ESG
and you've got the head of BlackRock
Larry Fink saying the ESG has become a
sort of a dirty word
and then we're seeing skipping ahead a
little bit uh
there's a bunch of Dei professionals
getting fired lately
so the Wall Street Journal is saying
that uh you know these are companies
have gotten rid of Dei employees lately
Netflix Disney Warner Brothers discovery
I have high profile people leaving and
uh
now here's your service summary of that
that they're in the crosshairs so to
speak because of all all the reasons
basically none of us working and the
reporting is that the executives who
brought in all these Dei people who were
just trying to look good
and nothing good came from it it just
caused them more work apparently so
there yeah there's a woke Purge so ESG
is failing Dei is
scaling down
and we have at least three you can give
me the real number but there's at least
three major Republican candidates who
want to get rid of all ESG and Dei
am I right
three major candidates but I think it
might be all of them so I might be under
accounting I think it might be do all of
the Republican candidates say they want
to get rid of all that stuff
all the racism
so that's pretty good
it sounds terrible that I have to be
happy that there are major candidates
for president who are opposed to racism
I guess that's good for you know it's
like you have to say it now they're
actually opposed to racism okay good
it's a step forward
all right uh
I guess we're going to have to talk
about uh all of the scandals
so we got some Biden scandals
we've got some Trump scandals and I
don't know about you but I'm starting to
mix up
all of the Biden scandal stories is
anybody having that like they're all
starting to sound too much alike and
then all of the Trump legal problems as
well
they're all starting to emerge in my
mind and I can't tell which is which but
see can you help me out and see if I've
forgotten anything all right so my
understanding is that that the hunter
Biden and his father the big guy have
the following three legal problems
can you give me a fact Jack on this so
one of them is the whistleblowers say
that uh
the FBI I think was slow walking the
investigation into Hunter's tax returns
is that correct
so number one is whistleblowers very
credible ones say the entire government
was basically just not doing their job
intentionally to protect Hunter
second one was the FBI now we knew that
we now know that the FBI knew
the laptops were real or the one with
the laptop
so apparently the FBI knew it was real
and told the public it wasn't
so that's new right now we know that
that's documented now so we're not
guessing anymore it's now documented
that they knew and they decided to lie
so that's true and now the third one is
this so-called 1023 form which is what
is used to interview people and there is
a witness or maybe more than one
um give me a fact check is it just one
awareness who makes some claims about
money from barisma
going to the bidens and going through a
series of concealing accounts and
corporate shells and Banks and stuff
like that and even in even a allege
alleged
um
statement that the reason they set up
these this this whole Labyrinth was to
conceal the payments
and that they were expecting that the
bidens would help them out getting rid
of the prosecutor which happened but we
don't know if it's because of that
but that's that's what allegedly they
were hoping for
but actually did happen
now
all of this stuff on that so-called
again fact check me if I'm wrong
is dependent on audio recordings and
maybe other documentation that we have
not seen
so that basically the only dot the only
uh backing for that 1023
is just the people who were interviewed
right is that true so could it be said
that the 1023 could be just another
Steele dossier
is there anything that would rule out
the 1023 being fake
has anything ruled that out
now the part we know is there there
appear to be bank records yes there
appear to be bank records but there
could be bank records and shell
companies for more than one reason
none of them are good
there I don't think there's any legal
legitimate reason to have all those
shell companies we all agree on that
right whatever all that you know
Labyrinth of financial confusion was
about it definitely wasn't about
anything legal
we all know that right so that's that's
not even a dispute I think I doubt
anybody would argue it but you still
need the actual crime
just because somebody set up a structure
uh that you would only set up for a
crime and money actually flew through it
exactly like you would for a crime money
laundering or at least hiding it from
the IRS
and
however if we don't actually have backup
for that 1023 beyond the financial
records is it going to hold
do you think that's a do you think that
that could I don't think it will
I think it's just short of being enough
but I'm not positive
because you know it's not my domain and
there'll be lots more we'll find out but
to me it looks just short
just just short of being now I'm not
saying it's not true
I want to make sure that I'm saying it
correctly I'm not saying that the
allegations are untrue
I'm saying that in terms of a court case
or you know really approving it
feels like it's just just lacking
so
we have not ruled out that it's just
another steel dossier
it could actually be Russian
disinformation
like actually literally it could be
in the real world actually literally
this time it could be Russian
disinformation but what's funny about it
this is the Democrats can't use that
excuse again even if it's real
you'd just be laughed at oh it's Russian
disinformation again isn't that
convenient
which does open up an opportunity for
some Russian disinformation
if Putin's paid attention
all right so then Trump is in trouble
for we'll get back to the 1023 thing
he's in trouble for his boxes
right
he is in trouble for
um
inciting j6 stuff there's some charges
that are going to come from that
and is he still in trouble in Georgia
for the find the votes phone call
is that still alive yes yes so and then
there's that F Gene Carroll thing but
that's a civil
so does it look like a tie
does it look like the two main
candidates for president
have three scandals a piece
maybe more
well they all have three and a half
because they both have a sex accusation
so three and a half scandals a piece
I put the sex candles as just one
scandal
all right well let's advertise now what
do you think the public is going to make
of all this
so you know I watch the news and that
you probably have this experience too
I'll watch the news there'll be the
major headline story for like days and
it won't be that difficult to understand
and I'll think well surely everybody's
heard this story
and the very first person I meet outside
in my own house
you know just run into somebody haven't
seen them in a while
and politics comes up
they haven't heard any of these stories
the average person isn't watching any
news at all no news at all
they're just not watching anything so
what happens when you take not just
regular news that they're not watching
most of the country but what happens if
it's a really complicated legal thing
where even the lawyers can't figure out
what's true
I'm not sure it affects the election
I think the level of confusion about all
this stuff is so great
that the voters are just going to go I
don't know it looks like two people with
legal problems I call it a tie
it's going to look like a tie
unless one of them is in jail it's going
to look like a tie now that doesn't mean
it is
it's just that the public won't be able
to sort it out it'll be too complicated
all right
so the uh the 1023 story is that there
were payments made to the bidens
for getting that prosecutor fired Biden
has bragged in public that he got that
guy fired
but said the reason was because he was
crooked and everybody wanted him fired
which might be true
um I I don't know what's true over there
I just figure everybody's lying about
everything if it's if it's Ukraine
everybody's lying about everything
so
we'll see if any of that uh
turns out to be true
um
Jonathan Turley is pointing out the
NBC's trying to cover for the bidens by
calling The Whistleblower
the IRS whistleblower
actually two of them
two whistleblowers who who confirm each
other's story it's the most credible
thing you could ever see they're the
most classic
uh exact examples of government
whistleblowers
and what does NBC call them so-called
whistleblowers
so-called whistleblowers
I guess the so-called whistleblowers
were at the the so-called hearing at the
so-called Congress
in the so-called United States
in the so-called earlier party of the
week
yep that really happened uh Scarborough
uh what's his first name Scarborough
gel yeah Morning Joe yeah I should
remember that uh Scarborough says uh we
have these so-called whistleblowers
and he says
I'm out of my asthma meds
so it's going to be tough to get through
the show actually
he says it's a clown show with the house
of Republicans
it's just a clown show all right
um there was this censorship here in
yesterday
and
RFK Jr was uh one of one of the main
people testifying and believe it or not
this sounds like a joke
the Democrats tried to censor him so
that we couldn't see the hearing so it'd
be a secret hearing
that actually happened
can you believe that
it was actually a censorship hearing
government censorship and the government
the Democrats
tried to have it censored I'm not making
that up
I'm not making that up that's a real
thing that happened and and they didn't
even hide it they didn't even hide it it
was just completely open now let's let's
uh let's censor this guy who wants to
talk about censorship
again
if the public were paying attention
that would probably be pretty bad for
Democrats but I don't think they are
plus and summer no you know nobody
believes any Summer Stories anyway
or they shouldn't
but uh
so RFK Jr did something awesome
everybody's heard about it by now
he had some opening statements prepared
but he he did that dramatic thing where
he sets them aside
and then he goes off on
probably
the most impressive extemporaneous
speech
you might ever see in your life
it was actually it was just it was
mind-blowingly
amazing
and he did it with his you know uh his
speech issues
and I gotta say
every time he does this thing
um
it's impressive
he makes you listen to something you
don't want to listen to if I can be
frank about it you don't want to hear
his voice
but if you if you take a minute of it if
you listen to the first minute you'll be
hooked
and you'll you'll stay for 10 minutes
and you'll be glad you did and when
you're done you're going to say
damn
we got some good people running for
president
he might not be your choice I get it
policy wise but he is really impressive
right we've got you know now we've got
Vivek impressive as hell
you know people like Trump I think
DeSantis is solid in his own way
we have really good candidates
really good candidates Joe Biden is not
one of them but we really do we you
should be really happy about that uh in
my opinion this is the best field of
candidates we've ever seen
and I don't think there was you know
name another candidate who could have
done what RFK Jr did
and by the way you should listen to it I
if I tried to characterize it he it
would lose all of its steam but the
basic idea is he talks about
uh the degree to which he was personally
censored and I was not aware I was not
aware of how overtly political it was
I thought it was just a lot of people
thought he was nuts so they were just
you know sort of acting accordingly but
no it looked pretty organized and it
looked like the timing was not
coincidental and it looked like it was
entirely political
it was actually political censorship
and it was it was jaw-dropping to hear
the evidence
but it was also inspirational
to hear a Kennedy speaking in a
kennedy-esque style and and the beauty
is you can you can say that he was
speaking in the kennedy-esque style and
it's not like an analogy or anything
Music Academy
apparently they learned that at Birth or
something they learned how to talk that
way that was just impressive so I
recommend it I recommend it if you just
want to feel good about the country
if you just want to feel good
about being an American for like 10
minutes just listen to RFK Jr talk about
America
what it should be and what it isn't
so good on him
by the way I absolutely love that I can
say unambiguously positive things about
somebody who's
um policy is don't line up with mine
exactly
I love that
well I like that I can just treat him
with respect and that that could be the
end of the conversation we just disagree
on a few things
all right
um there's a story that Vivek ramaswamy
is beaten DeSantis in some Kaplan
strategies poll that most people
who don't like the result are saying
there's a BS poll and you should not
believe it so I don't believe polls in
general at this point but
it's the story
so although the polling entity
may be questioned
and certainly the recent straw polls
like the TP USA in scruple where if they
came in second you could say that's not
a real poll that's a straw poll and then
I saw kanakoa the great on Twitter he
ran his own poll again a Twitter poll is
completely unscientific but Rama Swami
came in second
to drop so in each so there are three
instances recently in the last week in
which Vivek placed second or
competitively with uh DeSantis
now I'll say again none of that data is
reliable
and some of it could be wildly
unreliable probably is
but that doesn't matter to the narrative
it doesn't matter to the momentum right
so there's a momentum issue
so we're already looking at you know
what what might happen in the upcoming
primaries the fake might you know make a
dent there
we're already talking about DeSantis you
having to retool this campaign and why
isn't he doing better with all the money
he has
we're already tell the news is already
talking about desantises all this
funding yet Vivek is operating on the
shoestring
and killing it using new techniques
basically and smarter techniques and who
does Vivek remind you of in his
campaigning
tell me who we remind you of
the vague campaigning
Trump 2015 yes 12 2015. yeah he's using
he's using uh what would you call it uh
asymmetrical
techniques
basically he's going on to enemy
podcasts and owning them
who did that
who said I'm gonna go on all the most
critical podcasts and TV shows like CNN
and I'm going to own them and that's all
I went
yeah it's sort of a Trump trump method
in a way
so I think Vivek is doing a you know
modified improved it's an improved
version of trump and it works
so every time you see vague do something
smart
tell yourself this
when was the last time you saw him do
something that wasn't smart
do you have it
he's running he's running the best
campaign by far
how many would agree with the following
statement regardless of whether you want
him to be your president
how many would agree so far
Vivek has the best campaign on either
side and somewhat obviously so
I I would say he's floating well above
the other candidates in in skill
yeah and now basically I'm seeing every
one of you agree
almost 100
and are you going to tell me that's not
predictive
that's very predictive
because remember if a vague doesn't have
a government experience so you can't say
you liked him as a governor or something
the only thing you're going to see since
you didn't see him running his
businesses you're going to see him
running a campaign
right so the more he does a good job of
running a campaign the way he has the
more you're going to say well that guy
can do stuff he can do stuff and he's in
a field where he's competing against all
the other people who are the highest
quality candidates doing stuff
and the stuff that all of them are doing
he's doing better
you can't ignore that after a while
right and I also think he's the sexy
story
here's a
here's a tip about getting a free press
the Press does not care that somebody's
doing a good job
that's not a story because people do
good jobs
it's a story if you do a good job in a
different way
and that's what he's doing he's doing a
good job in a different way you know the
podcast the shoestring the you know even
his policies being as clear as they are
and provocative Etc
and eventually you just notice that so
every sign
is starting to uh
start to indicate that he will rise now
don't believe the polling yet I think if
you see a national poll is going to be
lower than these sketchy polls but the
sketchy polls do pick up in my opinion
if there's enough of the sketchy ones
and they all look the same it's picking
up an early indication
think about the fact just hold this in
your mind that I asked I don't know
there's probably several thousand people
watching right now
I asked several thousand people to agree
with the statement that Vivek has the
best
campaign by far and the by far thing
should have definitely got me some no's
some of you should have said now you
know somebody else is doing just as well
but nobody did none of you every single
person that I saw I may have missed one
but every answer I saw streaming by was
agree oh yeah it's the best campaign by
far
you tell me that's not predictive
that's completely predictive completely
polls are not polls are not predictive
but a stream of yeses With No No's
completely predictive
a lot will happen so you can't say
excuse me you can't say that's the end
point but it's very predictive
all right
um even Trump praised Vivek in I guess
it was in a truth saying that he had you
know pulled into second place and he was
doing great
do you think that that's a an accident
that Trump is boosting the lake
and then when Vivek is asked to
criticize Trump he won't do it he says
Trump was a great president
he says Vivek says I'm not running
against anybody
and that's pretty much exactly what I
want to hear
no you love that I'm not running against
anybody I'm running for the United
States
so I'm running for the United States I'm
offering you a set of skills and a set
of policies
if the other people are better vote for
them I mean it doesn't say that part but
you're saying this is my offer it's not
my job to make them look bad
just look at my offer
it's really strong very strong because
the weak play the week play is to say
that the other one is worse yeah oh man
you know Biden's falling apart he's a
hundred years old that's the weak play
at least I'm alive
his play is the strongest play you can
make I'm not even running against
competition
I'm not even running against anybody you
can't get stronger than that messaging
wise
all right so let's do a little uh
take a look at go walk go broke how
that's going so Bud Light did poorly
getting whoa Target stores that I
believe they're still down stock price
Disney taking a hit Ben and Jerry is
taking the hit
uh Stanford law school as a getting rid
of their Dei administrator
who accosted a sitting federal judge
yeah during one of their speaking events
uh she was in the crowd and accosted the
speaker for his political views I think
or not even political just for his views
they invited a speaker and then she
hackled him
and she worked for the she worked for
the school so she's going
and then Derek Chauvin is appealing his
conviction to the Supreme Court
now
what do you think about that
in my opinion so this is my opinion of
the whole George Floyd situation
um well I'm no expert on police
procedure
so I I don't have an opinion on whether
he violated police procedure
but
um I did not see him murdering anybody
I watched the video too and I didn't see
it I saw a tragic situation
and I saw a prisoner who made every
mistake that led to his own death
probably he took a bunch of pills when
he got stopped just so he wouldn't get
caught with him probably that's what
killed him
probably if he had said he had fentanyl
in him that he would have been treated
differently
probably if he said I think I'm
overdosing on fentanyl he would still be
here so if he hadn't been a criminal a
drug addict and a liar right till his
final breath
he'd probably be alive
that said it was still a tragedy
nobody wants to see but anybody get
killed
accidentally or intentionally it was
just a tragedy and I do think there's a
reasonable argument that maybe a a
police officer in that situation
should have known that there was more of
a problem than than a seed
and maybe he was playing to the crowd a
little too much maybe yeah I mean I I
think you'd have to be in his head to
know what was really happening and he
can't be
so what would be your guess
of what would be the outcome of a
Supreme Court ruling on this case
now that the temperature has gone down
and we see how much was you know
propaganda and how much was real
do you think that the Supreme Court will
uh change it overturn it I don't know
exactly what basis he's appealing with
them does anybody know upon what basis
is being appealed
what was it that didn't look Fair
uh some of you
all right yeah we don't know what it was
oh was it the jury was scared jury
tampering that's pretty guard that would
be a good argument a good argument would
be there wasn't a possibility of a fair
trial because the jurors would be afraid
for their own deaths
if you took that to me and I was under
the Supreme Court I'd set him free
with that argument if you made the
argument that the jurors could not have
possibly been independent
as the Supreme Court Justice I wouldn't
even have to listen to the argument
anybody who watched the news knows that
the jury couldn't possibly feel safe
they had to live in that town
to me that would be a slam dunk it would
be obvious evidence that he did not get
a fair trial which doesn't mean he's
innocent yeah you could have an unfair
trial independent of whether you were
guilty or Innocent but to me the
unfairness of the trial is
completely obvious
completely obvious there isn't any
chance he could have gotten a fair trial
in that situation but again I'm not
saying he was fall free not at all but
this could be
um
this is the sort of case that could
determine the presidency
right if the conservative Court
overturns the George Floyd thing
you're not going to get a Republican
president
is that too far
if the George Floyd thing gets
overturned before the vote there will
not be a Republican president
because the country will flip out
it has nothing to do with facts or
what's right or wrong the country would
just flip out you've got one side of the
country that's unbalanced
yeah not all of them of course but there
are many unbalanced people who would
literally cause riots and flip out and
of course the Democrats would fuel it
because it would be good for their
voting chances so yeah this could be the
only thing that matters to the uh who
gets picked president
could be the only thing that matters
it also might be a
it might be an advantage for Rama Swami
because you want you want the brownest
rip or Tim Scott you want the brownest
or blackest
candidate if you're going to be arguing
against George Floyd
right if George Floyd The Ghost of
George Floyd enters the conversation
you're going to want to have a Tim Scott
or a a recipe just to give you a little
bit more feeling of cover even though
it's irrelevant I mean all of this is
how you feel about stuff none of it is
logical
all right
um
yeah let's see what else has gone on
how many of you saw the former New York
Post editor who I think is that bright
bird now
um talking about the uh I think it was
the laptop story that got suppressed
if I have that right do my fact checking
and here is the best part about it so
first of all she did a tremendous job
of her Public Presentation it was just
really strong you know real my my
takeaway was wow that's that's a strong
person
I was just impressed with her as a
person she was her just she she had that
sort of natural
inward strength thing you know what I
mean very impressive anyway uh the best
part was that she laughed
um
at the attempts to cover up the story
because they were so ridiculous
and you have to hear her laugh
because the laugh
I've been telling you
you have to get to the left
you have to get to the point where you
can mock the ridiculousness
of you know at least half of the
country's actions and she laughed
genuinely and spontaneously and she
wasn't planning to do it I don't think
it didn't look plaid it looked like when
she thought about it it was hilarious in
retrospect that such a clown show had
ever happened and when you watch a
serious person laugh out loud at
Congress and laugh out loud genuinely
laugh
genuinely and mock this upness of
the other side that was suppressing the
story
it was a great moment in Congressional
hearings
it really was great so RFK Jr hit it out
of the park
but can you give me the name for for
some reason I was looking for a name and
everybody was talking about her as a
former New York Post editor
Emma Joe Emma Joe Morris thank you
yeah the news was weird about it the
news was like weirdly
at least in the headlines they were
suppressing her name
all right
so more of that more of that laughing
and mocking of things which should be
left at and mocked
because they are genuinely funny
all right
um I would like to give you now
the most provocative speculation you'll
hear all day
you ready
General America Garland
is the Rosetta Stone
that will allow you to figure out
who's running the actual country
now if you don't know what the Rosetta
Stone was it was a ancient stone that
had three different ancient languages of
the same message and because it was the
same message it was three ancient
languages this one stone
allowed you to figure out Egyptian
hieroglyphics and and other stuff
so the Rosetta Stone was the thing that
unlocked the the language and the
understanding of a whole bigger world
it's starting to look like Merrick
Garland
and let me tell you why why I come to
this conclusion
it looks like the doj and the FBI are
totally dirty
it looks like he was put there because
he's part of that
he gives me the impression of someone
who is not in charge of himself
can everybody agree on that
he gives the impression of someone who's
not in charge of himself
he does not look like somebody who is
strong
he does not look like he comes up with
opinions and then he makes everybody
agree or tough luck he looks like a
puppet
he has the personality and the
presentation of a puppet
now when uh was it the clintons who
originally tried who was it was it Obama
who tried to get him on the Supreme
Court
it was Obama right
so who do you try to put on the Supreme
Court if you're a Democrat a puppet you
are somebody who's absolutely definitely
going to vote the way you want
now I don't know if that's true on the
right
like Kavanaugh did not come off as a
puppet
did he
he came off as you know maybe
republican-e but he didn't look like a
puppet Gorsuch yeah no so the other ones
don't the other ones never struck me
that way they just don't have that
demeanor
but garlic garlic Merrick Garland
he looks like a puppet
now could you understand everything
about the allegations about the bidens
that were not being pursued
by him being the agent of the deep state
to me it looks like they put their most
trusted puppet in the Attorney General
job because they know they're all
criminals
right
so here's what you do you find out who
Garland is closest to in the real world
who's he have dinner with who's he
worked with in the past you know what
law firm was he in and you could piece
together the entire network of who's
actually in charge because they're all
going to have some connection that
emanates from him he is the Rosetta
Stone of who was actually in charge and
it's not the bidens
is clearly not do you know why I say
it's not the bidens I'm not doing that
old thing like oh Joe Biden is old and
he doesn't know where he is that's not
what I'm doing
it has nothing to do with his age
infirmary or his mental condition
you see what's happening right
Merrick Garland can put him in
jail
anytime he wants
Merrick Garland is in charge
because he can put Biden in jail anytime
he wants you know that
right you know that
you know he can because he's got the
goods
but mayor Garland will not do that do
you know why
because Mary Garland is not in charge of
America Garland
it's very it's very unlikely he's in
charge of himself
and if he's not in charge of himself it
means somebody controls Garland and
Garland controls the bidens
because they've known for a long time
that Hunter was crooked in fact I would
go further and say the reason that Biden
was chosen
is because he was controlled
I believe the only reason Biden was ever
a candidate and one is that he's a
controlled candidate
so look for Merrick Garland and who he's
connected to and that'll tell you who's
running the country
and no I'm not joking about any of it
not joking about any of it
that's the most logical explanation of
what we observe
the least logical explanation is that
the Democrats thought Biden would be a
good president
am I right
nobody's buying that like they might
think that he was good enough to get the
job done but do they really think there
was nobody
do Democrats really believe nobody
nobody was qualified by him he was the
one
I doubt it
right so you've got you've got a
president who's got a criminal rap sheet
or you know at least allegations a mile
long
and it all looks obviously true
to me it looks all obviously true the
only thing keeping the Biden Zone in
jail
has got to be the eternity General
and it would also argue that the some
member of the you know Democrats they
pretty much had to rig the election
to make sure they didn't lose because if
you were a Democrat and you lost you
went to jail
potentially because there were a lot of
crimes there it looks like
so to me it looks like the most the most
reasonable explanation of what we've
seen
and I'll say this as clearly as possible
there is no evidence that I'm aware of
that the 2020 election was rigged
I'm not aware of any evidence of that
however is the most reasonable the most
reasonable interpretation of everything
we've seen is that it was
but no evidence
but could it be rigged and leave no
evidence
of course
of course it's only the idiot media that
tells you it's impossible
oh there's no way to rig an election
that can't happen
so you know I'm not claiming there's any
evidence
there's no evidence that I'm aware of
none at all zero evidence that I'm aware
of that's you know that I would call
credible
however
when you look at the totality of the
situation it was a it was a can't lose
situation
in a can't lose situation you don't
leave it to the voters do you
if you thought you could go to jail
if you lost the election would you leave
it to the voters if you've already if
you're already a criminal
if you're already a criminal you're
going to do the second crime to stay out
of jail for sure you're not going to say
well I did that crime I'm going to go to
jail but I'd hate to do anything illegal
to stay out of jail
no
so the most reasonable explanation is
that Garland
is owned
he's the one who owns Biden and there's
somebody somebody else is in charge or
more it might be more than one I mean it
doesn't it's not necessarily one person
might be a group of people who have
something in common
how do you like my speculation
you loved it because it agrees with what
you want to think anyway
if I had to bet on it got into head
gun to head I bet it was true
gun to add I would bet it's true
but I don't know and I and I can't give
you any evidence
so
anyway
uh let's see what that does
um if you're if you're subscribed to the
Dilbert reborn comic either on Twitter
you can subscribe see my profile or
you're subscribed on the locals platform
has got items
locals.com you would know that uh
Dilbert is still in an albonian jail
with the Tate brothers
and uh today they're teaching them how
to be a man
that's all I'm going to tell you
the taint brothers are teaching Dilbert
how to be a man in jail
uh
so can't tell you the rest but you won't
see that in newspapers
all right
ladies and gentlemen
um I still have four minutes to go for
my hour
is there a story I missed
you know I could have spent all day long
talking about the uh the hearings
but honestly it's too complicated
like you get into the minutia so much
that it sort of loses its Sparkle
um
Optimus Tesla is what
Optimus Tesla's humanoid root does Tesla
have a humanoid robot that we've seen
is it ready to go
I cannot oh yeah I guess it missed that
story but
how much do you want to have a Tesla
robot
I think the first ones are just going to
be industrial right yeah they're not
going to be for the home
I think they just carry heavy boxes in
factories and stuff
now the reason I discourage Super Chat
is not that I don't want your money
it's that it's uh disruptive to the flow
Dr Shiva interview haven't seen it
um
why is the media covering them all
covering what
how long until we have robots building a
pyramid super pyramid
oh Anthony Anthony Weiner on the uh
uh Patrick David podcast how many Saw
um Patrick Bet David pdb
and Anthony Weiner go off with each
other
it was useless
yeah no nobody I don't think either of
them look good
it was two completely unreasonable
people yelling at each other and neither
neither of them there were no winners
let's just say it didn't look good for
either one of them
it would have been really easy to make
that a
um
a real conversation let's call it an RFK
Junior kind of conversation where people
are not just yelling at each other
so yeah
to me that was just worthless
all right he's usually very composed
um
this has been
uh aw what
all right well
yeah there were no winners in that all
right um
yeah
who's who's the best podcasters now
who are your favorite let's say
political podcasters well me of course
but not counting me
show me your favorites Roseanne
uh
Dave Rubin
bongchino Pac-Man
Temple
Greenwald Barnes Corolla
JRE
Shapiro Levin sticks
Kelly well there's quite a quite a few
of them Matt Walsh Theo
Viva
Jimmy Dore Dr Drew
Tim Dillon wow so I I asked the other
day if somebody would make a sort of a
TV viewing schedule
that would include those podcasters
because a number of us do a show at the
same time or the the same time every day
wouldn't you like to see the master list
of who who is when
because I don't know where I would go to
get that but somebody should make that
and it would help because then somebody
who comes in with a new show
uh doesn't have to compete if they put
it in the right place
there should be an actual TV Guide for
podcasters and then it just replaces
television entirely
all right
Crowder
Joe Rogan trigonometry you know as the
names are going by
it it's sorting
it's really sinking in
that the a number of these podcasts are
like you know broadcast TV right Bungie
know
um
Greenwald et cetera they have old shows
I mean it's just a whole TV show and
uh I'm pretty sure they've yeah Russell
Brand very high production values
Federalist podcast all right well
somebody needs to put that together and
tweeted at me so I can retweet it for
you
if if he tweeted at me I'll retweet it
so if somebody wants to take that on if
more than one of you do it I'll I'll
tweet all of them
because one of them would be better than
the others probably
um and then keep it on Eastern Standard
Time I guess standardize the time
all right uh and hotel Jesus yes
Andrew Clavin yeah there's so many of
them there are probably there are
probably 30 podcasts
that are quite high quality that you
would enjoy in politics and stuff all
right oh dark house yeah Zoobe there's
so many I got
Mark Dice
Tim Dillon so I I did agree to do
Roseanne's podcast
did I tell you all that I can't remember
if I told you so I'll I'll do Roseanne
uh we're we're recording on August
8th or ninth or something I'll let you
know when it gets close and
uh but I I don't know yet if it runs
live or if it's recorded
yeah I never I never
close the circuit with Russell Brand
but when my next book comes out reframe
your brain which should be up a few
weeks uh we're getting very close all
the hard stuff's done we're just working
through some details of getting it
listed Etc
but uh once the book is available I'll
do some podcasts
so that's when I'll reach out to people
who have asked me in the past
uh but I was not doing I was not doing
them
so
um
Jordan Peterson uh that invited me
before I got canceled I think it was
before
and I'm not sure he still wants to talk
to me but if if anybody wanted to do
something dangerous it would be him
and so I'll follow up with uh Russell
Brand and I'll follow up with
um
Jordan Peterson and some of the other
people who would ask me I think Megyn
Kelly asked me at one point I believe
so yeah Megan Kelly I'll follow up with
her as well trigonometry I've never been
invited on that
um
yeah
all right
who would uh who would be my best
podcast combination I'm thinking it
might be Roseanne that's why I was so
quick to say yes
Michael malice
okay there's no way there's no way that
would be anything but fun
me and Michael malice
that would be fun Greg goffeld always
fun of course
uh Lex would I would I fit with Lex
do we have the right energy
Tim Ferriss you're saying Tim Ferriss
would be great
love Tim Ferriss
um Bill Maher
I
I still isn't it weird that
I haven't been invited to Bill Maher's
Club random
I don't I don't know who would be more
an ideal person to be on that than me
but oh well
Tim Poole
um yeah I should I should talk to Tim
I think his guests have to be in person
right does he like most of his guests to
be there in person yeah I might do some
traveling we'll see
haven't decided all right that's all for
now thanks for joining and YouTube I
will see you tomorrow
stay awesome
