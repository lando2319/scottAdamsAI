who would like to see a picture of some
cats you would while you're waiting for
everybody to get in
here let's see if I can make that
happen something just
happened picture of a cat huh I know I
have it here there we go
there are two cats that watch my show
every
day
whoops I seem to have lost
my signal there I am here's a picture of
two cats that watch my show every
day every morning I get a picture of
these two cats as they get ready to
watch the show with their with their own
who shall remain
anonymous all right let me see if I can
fix my comments
here let's try one more time and then
we'll have a show today's show is going
to be amazing I don't always say that
but today for sure you're going to love
it
well good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
if you've showed up here you're probably
here at the best time that will ever
happen to anybody ever if you'd like to
take it up to levels that well you can't
even understand with your tiny human
smooth brains all you need is a cuper
muger glass a tanker chel Stein a
canteen Jugger FL vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure pleasure I sound
like Joe Biden in parallel pleasure the
dopamine here the day thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous siing happens now
go you know Joe Biden has given me an
idea for a strategy for life
I'm going to start looking stiff now so
that later when I'm halfway gone people
will say no no he's he's always been
like that so if you don't
mind I'd like to do my show like
this
both too early too soon too
soon well I have a uh reframe for you
uh today I learned that there are people
who
think that the amount of time it takes
you to do
something is based on how long it takes
you to do the thing how many of you
think that if I said to you you need to
do this thing would you say to yourself
well that's going to take you know one
hour or whatever you estimate and then
you would say to yourself I guess I need
one hour to do this how how many think
like that now you're get some of you are
saying well isn't that the normal way
you think you think in terms of how long
something would take and then you
allocate that amount of time right well
years ago I learned a magic
secret the am the length of time it
takes to do any task is the amount of
time you had to allocate to
it I learned that when I was doing
comics when I had a full-time job and I
would get up in the morning and I'd have
to draw a comic every day or else get
behind schedule so I had you know an
hour and a half to draw a comic you know
the from writing to drawing the first
draft
sometimes almost the entire time would
be gone I'd have 10 minutes left and I'd
have nothing and then I would write the
entire comic in 10
minutes so I'd give myself an hour and a
half but I could write it in 10 minutes
if I had to and then I realized that
that was generalizable to just about
everything no matter what you think you
should take if you don't have that much
time you'll just figure it out and it
made me wonder if people who are late
all the time think that things just take
as much time as they
take and I thought if I'd never learned
that you can make any schedule
work pretty much you pretty much you
know there there are physical
constraints you know that you can't have
a baby in one month right that example
but in terms of you organizing your own
time your schedule just your normal life
you can kind of make anything fit I I
also noticed that when I was the busiest
in my career I could add the most to it
which is to completely counterintuitive
but the reason I could do that is that
when I was super busy I would make sure
that any new thing I added would be in
the smallest slice of time and then I
would just look at that tiny little
slice of time and I'd say how in the
world am I going to get two hours worth
of work into that 10 minutes and then I
would just do it and every time I did it
I think huh I was sure that would take
two hours so as a as a good General
mindset reframe tell yourself that uh
you can make any task for any time frame
now that's not entirely true you cannot
make every task for every time frame
it's not true it's a
reframe reframe doesn't have to be
technically true it just has to be a
better mindset than whatever you were in
and the worse mindset you could have is
that things are going to take as long as
they're going to take don't think that
way think that you can make anything
work in any amount of time and then just
make it happen you you'll be right 99%
of the
time well there's a new breakthrough in
science maybe um noo nutrients it's a
company that can turn CO2 into protein
so they do a chemical reaction and they
turn it into some kind of protein which
with a little more work they might
figure out how to make it a food
source so is this perfect or
what you know they always science
sometimes will come up with solutions
that are impractical well technically it
work but it's impractical
but suppose because food prices are so
high thanks to
inflation and we're the we're the
fattest country in the world America I
don't know if that's true but let's say
it is if they find a way that we can eat
our away and of climate
change they have figured out the
smartest
solution well they're not going to drive
less but could we make them eat more I
think we could we'll never get him to
drive less we could sure as hell get him
to eat more so uh maybe if this works
you'll eat your way to climate
happiness and you can eat some bugs too
I hear no don't worry about this and I
know what you're going to say I know
what you're going to say but
Scott the CO2 is already plant food it
makes the plants grow we eat the plants
we don't need this know I hear you and
you're also going to say Scott we have a
solution for CO2 it's called trees have
you heard of them they're called
trees that's for the NPCs I do a
separate show for the NPCs who just have
to say the obvious things so that's for
them all right here's a little lesson on
how to know what's true and what's not
true now like most of these lessons on
knowing what's true and what's not true
they're not 100%
they're just directionally statistically
likely to help you out let me give you
an example I call this one the dog not
barking and you've heard this one before
but the more examples you hear the more
you can recognize it so the dog not
barking is the thing that should be
happening if your if your current
understanding of the world is correct
there should be something happening
that's not happening and if it's not
happening you should say huh maybe my
worldview is incorrect
because if it were correct there's
definitely a thing that would be
happening I'll give you two
examples uh you would agree I think that
there is a fairly widespread doubt in
the United States about election
security we know that when Trump won in
2016 the Democrat leaders like Hillary
Clinton said it's rigged or something's
rigged they didn't say the vote was
rigged they thought Russia rigged it
somehow but maybe they thought Russia
rigged the vote I don't know whatever
they thought they they weren't so sure
the election gave us the right result
and then of course Trump famously
thought he got the wrong result when he
lost and probably I don't know 40% of
the public thinks that the elections are
completely
artificial and if somebody decides who
the president is and then there's just
some theater called an election so
that's pretty widespread doubt about the
election now would you agree with the
premise
that there is
widespread doubt about the Integrity of
the election I'll say
widespread 30 to 40% of the public would
that be
fair um now what would you expect if the
government knew that the Integrity of
elections are just fundamentally
important to the country just Baseline
fundamental necessity that we have to
trust the elections what would what
would you expect what dog would be
barking well I'll tell you the dog you
would expect would be the government
would say whoa that's a lot of people
not trusting our elections that's
existential threat so what we'll do is
we'll educate the public on how the
election systems are uh can be audited
easily and how we know that they're
secure how hard would that be it'd be
one
video maybe one document and it would
just describe oh you public the thing
you don't know is that our elections are
way more secure than you think and
here's how we always know that your vote
got to the Final Destination and here's
how we can tell if there's any
irregularity and here's how we can
easily audit if anybody has that
question therefore by the design of the
system you can see that you should trust
the
election isn't that the most obvious
thing you'd
see if the government knows that 30 or
40% the public roughly doesn't trust the
process and it wouldn't be hard to tell
them why it works you just say here's
the process you can see how perfect it
is see how welld designed it is there's
no room for any error
here but we don't see that do we we
don't see that wouldn't that be easy to
produce somebody who understood the
election system well enough to know it
was Secure if it were me for example
let's say I let's say I were the expert
I could write that up in I don't know
two hours and it would change the whole
country because people would look at my
document they say oh well you know I
didn't know this I didn't know that they
could so easily audit and catch mistakes
so I guess it's secure where's
that where is it two hours of work for
one person to just describe how the
election is
secure never seen it have you
don't you think that given the size of
the
problem that people don't trust the
elections given the size of the problem
it may have caused something like a
protest Insurrection according to the
Democrats the size of that problem
nobody would write a two-page document
explaining why you don't have to worry
about the
results that's that's pretty pretty
obviously missing would you say did I go
too far has anybody ever seen any
describe to you why it is in fact a
secure election no you'll never see that
you know why because it's obviously not
secure I don't think it could be more
obvious that's the most obvious thing in
the world right now is if you could
secure it and if you could
know the government would have told you
how you can secure it and how you can
know it's
secure and they
don't it's pretty glaringly obvious
all right here's another one if you
thought that climate change was going to
destroy the world and you you really
thought that the climate models were
telling you something useful and you
knew that a huge portion of the world
more conservatives than that don't
believe climate change is even
real what would you do if you were the
government and you are absolutely sure
that it's the biggest problem in the
country in the world really
and and people didn't believe it so they
weren't maybe acting right well I think
your new sources would be encouraged to
have experts with both views on and then
the the critic would say I'm not so sure
but this climate change then the expert
would say well here's why you should be
and then the critic would say well I'm
not so sure you can measure accurately
and then the expert would say oh you
know I can see why you'd say that
but here's the evidence that we can
measure
accurately wouldn't you expect that if
the argument in favor of climate change
is so rock solid and 30% of the country
doesn't believe it would you deal with
it by saying well you guys are idiots
97% of the uh scientists are on the same
side is that the best you could do if
the whole if the whole world is going to
be destroyed and all it would require to
fix it in other words getting all the
people on the same page page would be
just showing both sides because if you
showed both sides and one side is just
overwhelmingly obviously
true wouldn't that be enough just show
both arguments you can see that one of
them is who so much better but where is
it the most obvious thing you'd expect
if it's true that climate change is an
existential risk you would see that all
over the place every single time you
turned on the news they say look you're
not getting it yet we really got to we
really got to educate you here's the
expert ask them anything you
want right the most obvious thing you'd
have and let's go even more
obvious since the crisis is really
predicated on the reliability of the
models don't you think that given the
models climate models have now been
running for decades
wouldn't they tell you how accurate the
predictions
were wouldn't they show you look this
predicted that New York City would be
underwater by okay okay that one didn't
work out but the one thing we can tell
you is that by now according to all of
our models and predictions you have
predictions on top of models but the
prediction on top of the model is the
polar bearers are completely go okay
they're coming back okay that's that's
that one didn't work out but one thing I
can tell you is that the coral reefs the
Great Barrier Reef is um okay it's
really coming back in the last three
years wouldn't you wouldn't you see the
argument that the predictions have been
right so far thus giving you confidence
that their next prediction would right
you don't see that when was the last
time you saw a uh when was the last time
you saw a news show they said there have
been eight predictions about you know
everything from sea l
to hurricanes to
whatever how we
doing you don't see it because it won't
check out
obviously so just learn that dog not
barking if they're not making the
argument you know they would make if
they believe their own argument you know
they would be making the argument
everybody likes to be right everybody
who has a strong argument wants to crush
the people with their dumb little stupid
argument so why aren't the people with
the good arguments crushing the people
with the bad ones kind of missing isn't
it all right uh speaking of
ridiculousness some Executives from the
AI company
Humane which I think that company is not
doing so well with their new device but
uh two of them are leaving and they're
going to find their own uh factchecking
startup
really I I I feel so bad for them
they're going to waste their
time so there's two people who think
that they can start a factchecking
startup which suggests that those two
people have some way to figure out
what's
true do you think they
do if they did they'd be the first
people in the
world no do they really think it's going
to be like an objective fact check or
are they just working for one side and
it's going to be another totally fake
fact check thing what do you
think it but it's
ridiculous to imagine that they know
what's true we know that's not the case
it's going to be more like okay
assume climate change is real and then
anybody who fact checks against it must
be lying it's going to be now
there's some indication they're going to
use AI as some part of it but I think
the uh they're not using AI as the final
word it'll just be a tool with their
within their
system uh but how in the world are they
going to decide what's
true I don't know how they're going to
do it that nobody else could do it so it
it's a it's a bit of ridiculousness
every time you think you can fix it by
by telling people the truth you don't
really understand what's going on
telling people what's real they wouldn't
recognize it and wouldn't believe it if
they saw it and neither would you so how
are you the source of what's real
well there's a new device uh an
implantable LED device that uses some
kind of light treatment on deep-seated
cancers so the idea is they put this
little LED um right into your body and
it would be um where there would also be
a light activated drug so the light the
little LED that would be inserted into
your body would uh light up the drug
that's let's say
near the cancer and between the light um
what what would you call such a thing
what would be another word for that
let's see if you had something toxic in
your body in this case the cancer and
you wanted to you want to put some kind
of light in there to get rid of it what
what would that be called well if you're
a
Democrat and you're a idiot you
would call it injecting bleach into your
arm do you know why you would call it
that because that's what they did call
it when President Trump talked about the
technology which did exist and which he
did know about which is uh the heel
light technology that was being planned
in which they would use a some kind of
catheter um to put an LED light that
would be UV light in this case down your
trachea and potentially into your lung
and that would radiate your lungs and
they were testing it it didn't work out
by the way didn't work but the idea was
that they would disinfect your lungs
with
light and the idiots called
Democrats to a person I don't think a
single one got this right said Oh you
mean drinking
disinfectants which turned into Oh you
mean drinking bleach which turned into
Joe Biden saying injecting bleach into
your
arm that never gets fact
checked oh actually it did get fact
checked Daniel Dale did fact check that
but he but he also Daniel Dale
incorrectly fact checked that the
president was wrong and
unclear here's what really happened the
two experts on the stage Burks and
whoever it was were less aware of that
technology than Trump was so when Trump
brought it up and mentioned light he
very specifically mentioned light before
the comments and then light after the
comments to make sure that you knew he
was talking about
light and the two experts Dr Burks that
piece of
 confirmed that he was talking crazy
no he knew more than you did he knew
more than you did about that topic he
was trying to show
off and it didn't work out at all
because the experts knew less than he
did so he he was trying to show the
world that he was up there with some
experts and he could engage with them on
a topic that the public wasn't so aware
of it would make him look like he knew
what he was talking about but instead
the idiot experts decided to
misinterpret him as some kind of
drinking disinfectant and
then the world went with that one one of
the biggest hoaxes in American history
and the entire Democrat world thinks it
was real and it's become part of Biden's
campaign no it's not injecting bleach
you
idiots all right scientists have
developed an invisible mask it's kind of
a hat that blows air down from the hat
and they say it will block those viruses
coming in oh
great the last thing I want is a new
technology to keep my body away from The
Real World
I do not want a mask hat no mask hats no
mask hats well another uh another news
uh Elon Musk won on he was fighting a
$500 million sever suit over the mass
layoffs on the old Twitter to which I
said to myself how could they possibly
win
that what what kind of job did the
Twitter people think they had did
Twitter think think that their jobs were
like the magic kind where you don't get
fired just for any reason
whatsoever I've never held a job where I
couldn't get fired for any reason they
wanted so mus comes in fires 80% of them
for any reason he wanted which in this
case was making money and it
worked I I have a feeling that maybe
they started the lawsuit before it was
obvious it was one of the greatest
management moves of all time because it
worked and and X is heading toward cash
profitability this year at least cash
positive
now that's embarrassing that they even
brought that suit I mean to even bring
that suit makes it sound like you don't
know how anything works like you've
never had any experience in the real
world how did all these people go to
work in a you know in the capitalist
World they got a job and a paycheck and
somehow they didn't think that the boss
could fire them for any reason he
wanted I don't
know uh Elon Musk talking about mail in
ballots said this um when combined with
mail in ballots meaning the election the
system is quote designed to make it
impossible to prove
fraud uh he says mail and and drop box
Bell should not be allowed as cameras on
the in-person voting stations could at
least prevent large scale fraud by
counting how many people showed up
versus ballots cast that's pretty good
test how many people walked in you could
just count them and then you can count
the votes and you see if there's more
votes than there are people but you
can't do that if it's just you know bags
of votes that show up now here's what I
liked about this I like that he framed
it as design
it's
designed designed to not
work it's not accidentally not working
mean not working meaning you can't tell
if you got the result you
wanted you could definitely tell if you
got the right
result if you didn't do this so why
would you introd introduce into the
design the one thing that would make the
election the least credible and open it
up for the most fraud
unless your intention was
fraud don't you think it's obvious that
the intention is
fraud because the you know the arguments
are
ridiculous that uh you know you're going
to get the wrong answer in the election
if you do it all in one day with paper
ballots even though that works
everywhere everywhere they do it it
works but we would be the only country
where it wouldn't work
and and it's it's all this
about black people can't get driver's
licenses I mean it's basically pure
racist and here's here's the
more uh Common Sense thing to say if
voting in person is enough to keep you
from
voting given that you could probably get
off work and you could probably do it
after work or even before work given
that almost everybody in the world can
figure it out do you want any part of
your democratic process to be determined
by people who wouldn't be able to vote
in person now I get it NPCs you're
supposed to rush in NPCs please this is
your time to shine I expect the NPCs to
come in and say B Scott B Scott what
about my grandmother who can't make it
your grandmother can vote by mail B
Scott B Scott what about the the people
in the military who are
overse fine the military can vote by
mail you're not arguing the other
point the only thing is you don't want
to do widespread uncontrolled mail and
ballots and if you design that into the
system we must assume there is no other
purpose than fraud it's designed fraud
and musk is calling it out for exactly
what it is now does that mean that I can
prove that the election will have fraud
no but I can definitely prove that they
intend
it you can look at the design the design
is a clear clear intention of cheating
because there's no other reason to do it
why would you design a system worse when
it takes more money you know more time
and effort to make it
worse you wouldn't there's only one
reason all right what happens if this
year or yeah if this election what
happens if there's another one of those
late night vote count stops for
mysterious reasons followed by Trump who
way ahead uh being blazed past by mailin
boats that are counted last for
Biden what do you think is going to
happen
then
violence do you think violence is going
to
happen I'm more worried that it wouldn't
now I don't promote violence I don't
want to see any violence but it is
nonetheless a feature of the world that
violence is the thing that keeps people
from doing bad
things violence is part of the um police
and military because you need sometimes
violence to keep people from doing the
wrong thing so violence is not something
you want to get rid
of you just need to make sure it's in
the right place within a legal structure
right so don't break any laws
and don't be violent
however if the public is willing to
never be violent then you're giving away
your
democracy so I think I can say all these
things at the same time don't be
violent don't be
violent but if the public gives away
their option to be violent then they
also give away the Democracy for sure
because the the risk of violence is is
the only thing that keeps the country
free there's no other there's no other
check and balance because all the other
systems could so easily be corrupted
right in front of you that if there were
no counter Force to it it would just
happen I would argue it's already
happened but I don't think that they can
get away with that
again because even even if you imagine
there was a reason for it which is more
Biden voters vote by mail that was their
excuse it's pretty clear that the entire
right leing part of the country isn't
going to buy it they're just not going
to buy it so unless somebody's standing
there to watch those new ballots coming
in we're going to have a problem here
would be the ultimate problem which I do
expect to happen this is this is a
prediction I believe that late at night
The Observers who are Republican will be
kicked
out and I believe that after the after
The Observers are kicked out as they
were before forward by the way there's
precedent for this they will simply make
an argument that The Observers are being
um
disruptive that's all they have to do
just say oh you're stopping us from
doing our job you're not observers
you're stopping us from doing our job so
security is going to have to show you
out because we can't we can't not have a
result we have to get a result so all
these observers who keep complaining
that the ballots don't look real to them
uh security is going to have to take
them out and then you say to yourself
but Scott you know once they've seen the
bad stuff they can just tell the courts
they can make a case out of it and the
courts will look at these ballots and if
they're fake well then they change it no
that won't happen the system is designed
so that can't happen even if the
witnesses see it with their own
eyes there can be no no action do you
know why because we know do you know
what happened when Observer said we saw
a bunch of ballots that are fake and
they're in that room over there they
went to the court and they said hey can
you open that locked room because we've
got you know credible information that
if you do we'll find out the entire
election was rigged do you know what
happened the judge ruled that they had
to be opened well okay so then it was
opened right no no the judge ruled it
had to be opened and then nobody opened
it and people complained and nothing
happened it remained closed and now the
the
lawyers are saying we'd like to we'd
like permission to destroy the things in
the room that they wouldn't open that
was ordered to be
opened why would they order it to be
destroyed as opposed to just opening it
and saying well you you thought that
these were fake but as you can see
they're perfectly fine take a look
yourself why wouldn't they do that
there's only one
reason and they're going to do it again
because they got away with it and there
is no counter to it they can just throw
out the they can just throw out the
observers under any excuse do whatever
cheating they want and then just stall
until it's too late to reverse it and
then the court will say well it's too
late or the court will say you don't
have standing or the court will say you
know who who was injured by it or the
court will say can you prove that it
would change the election no I can't
prove it because I don't know what's
behind the closed door that they won't
open so you see that the system because
it's slow and the courts are really
biased toward making sure there's a
result there is no
mechanism even if you see it with your
own eyes we know this for sure even if
The Observers see it with their own eyes
multiple observers we have no system to
change it correct it or reverse it we
know that for sure sure and the
Democrats don't know that they think
that the court is functioning and you
know doing everything it does of course
it isn't not even
close so that's coming it's hard for me
to believe there will be a result from
this
election so I'm going to be the
contrarian and say under the current
design I don't see that we could have an
election that the country accepts
do you under the current design because
unfortunately we learn too much about
how they get away with stuff but we
don't have any counter to
it which means we're just going to watch
it happen in all likelihood we're just
going to watch it happen and not be able
to do a thing now what happens when that
happens well I'll tell you what won't
happen we'll have a president that
everybody agrees got elected so I'm not
even sure if I'm not even sure if we
could get an election
certified I
suspect that no matter what the vote
count is it won't get
certified that's what I think now it
won't require you know anybody attacking
the capital I think the politicians
themselves will look at it and say you
know what you have a point we actually
don't know if we had an
election I think that's what's going to
happen I think the politicians who have
to certify it in Congress will look at
it and they will say honestly we don't
even know if we had one we don't even
know if we had an election that's what's
going to
happen all right you know what you don't
hear about too much now that uh Biden
won't leave office and uh 100% of
Democrats are quite sure that if he were
to change his mind and leave office the
Democrats would be in much better shape
to fight against Hitler and save the
world from climate change
and save Ukraine all those things they
say are deeply deeply
important but you know what you don't
hear
anymore Biden is fighting for
you and Trump is only in it for himself
that used to be one of their biggest
themes you know why you can't say
that because Trump is just running for
for president in a democracy with a list
of things he'd like to do to improve the
Country Joe Biden is the entire
country double the Democrats so
they're not going to get their way for
whatever is good for Joe Biden and his
family now does anybody doubt that is
there any Democrat who says yeah you
know what Joe is doing what's best for
the country by staying in the race no no
they might say it because you know they
they don't have a choice or something
but there's no Democrat who thinks that
Joe Biden is working for the country
now so so one of the main that you know
their three-legged
stool was he's going to be a a
dictator um he'll take your democracy
you'll steal your
democracy and he's only in it for
himself right the only in it for himself
thing is
gone because nobody has ever shown more
selfishness than narcissism in office
than Biden is showing right now probably
more mental decline than those things
but you cannot argue that Biden's the
one who's in it for the country that
argument is
gone what watch you not hear it and by
the way that's another dog not
barking right did did you notice that
they stopped saying it if you didn't
notice that they just went cold on one
of the three
major complaints about Trump
you should have
noticed look for the dog not barking
it's telling you way more than the dog
that's
barking all
right
so uh I guess the New York Times didn't
like it when uh Biden said it was the
elite Democratic critics who want him to
step down so they're doubling down and
wrote another editorial saying Biden
should step down and be replaced with
some uh chosen candidates that would be
better now let let me see if you
recognize the the system what what would
the system be called or the country that
does it in which there is a democracy
there there's definitely a vote and the
vote is even fair the vote is completely
Fair as far as you know there's no
cheating but the candidates that you get
to pick are selected by let's say one or
just a handful of the elites so you
don't get to vote for anybody you want
you get to vote for one of let's say
five people that were
handpicked by some higher authority what
what kind of system would that be would
you call that
uh F Dem democracy with a republic kind
of a structure would you call that the
American system who does it remind you
of the correct answer is is Iran that's
exactly Iran system so the Ayatollah
presumably with Consulting of the other
top Mulla people the uh the Ayatollah
says these five people can run for
President we will have a totally fair
election nobody complains I've never
heard anybody in in Iran complain that
the election was rigged maybe they do I
just don't hear about it but their
intention I believe their actual
legitimate intention is to run a fair
election because any of the five people
have already been vetted to be okay with
the
Ayatollah now what is it the Democrats
want to do they want to get their
Elites Obama Bill Clinton few other
people like that they want them to
quickly put together a list of five
candidates to do a little Blitz um kind
of a
primary that's Iran that's the Iranian
system now how would you like to be
Trump and you're running
against the Iranian government
system Trump trump won his place fair
and square it he Trump destroyed you
know 16 Challengers the first time and
however many Challengers there were this
time it's
Trump anyway
so I heard the best argument yet for
just somebody on X who wanted to take a
shot at the best
argument
um that Trump will become a dictator in
his second term but he didn't become one
in his first because Republicans like to
say why are you so afraid he's going to
become Hiller when you saw an entire
term and he didn't become Hiller and
here was the best argument all right I'm
not saying I agree age with it this is
the best argument that in his first term
he didn't have the option of you know
stacking all the government entities
with his own people so he had a lot of
people who were kind of frankly
anti-trump in his own
Administration so if he tried to take
any kind of dictator power there were
just so many people in his own
Administration who wouldn't be up for it
that it wasn't really possible but he's
had time since his first Administration
is Consolidated power so all the
Republicans are under his control or at
least the ones in key departments and
stuff you know the Attorney General will
be the Supreme Court or his nominations
Etc and that by consolidating power
which he's done over time his second
term would allow him unprecedented power
to become this dictator that they fear
what do you think of that by the way
that's the first time I've heard that
argument and I have to say that at least
at least it has some bones on it you
know at least it's not just some
 you just made up by sitting in
a room and imagining things I mean
there's it is a reality I would I would
concur with the um the assumptions the
assumptions that he's Consolidated
support and it will probably show up in
this
Administration that seems fair but
here's the part that's
missing please describe to me
and by you you saw this with January 6
where people said can you describe to me
how that protest could have turned into
taking over a country what what was the
mechanism was the person with the
nuclear football going to say whoa looks
like we got new leaders here's the
football like describe it in some way
that doesn't sound crazy you can't there
there is no path that a bunch of
protesters in one building takes over a
country
it's absurd now let's do the same thing
with
Trump imagine Trump decided to do some
dictator
stuff do you really think the
government's going to be okay with that
see it could be the things that you know
maybe Democrats think are dictator
Republicans would think would be normal
Republican policies so there's some of
that but under what situation could
Trump remain in power for the rest of
his life and get away with
that the Democrats have never met a
republican I think maybe never met one
because there's no Republican who's okay
with a republican
dictator none the whole Republican
situation is
Constitution you know the the falty is
always to the Constitution and why do
they like
Trump because he's compatible with the
Constitution the moment he became not
compatible with the Constitution he
would lose 100% of support he would lose
Don Jr he would lose a
vonka not and and I don't mean that as
hyperbole he would literally lose his
own family support there is no situation
in which he can just say I'm 81 years
old I think I'll be the
dictator nobody's going to say yes to
that nobody in the military nobody in
this administra
his own Chief of Staff would shoot him
whoever it is right like it's the it's
the smallest risk I've ever seen of any
risk in the United States the smallest
risk there's none but you have to be
deeply gaslighted to think that there's
a path between some protesters moving
electr and controlling the nuclear
Triad or that Trump you know has some uh
let's say strong leader tendencies
and then somehow the entire Republican
party would cast off the
Constitution what kind of thinking gets
you to
that that that's a complete
misunderstanding of boundary complete
misunderstanding anyway uh rasmason did
some polling on media bias 61% of likely
voters think the bias in the news is
getting
worse um 45% agree with the statement
um that no matter how much you hate the
media it's not enough 45% that's almost
exactly
Republicans uh 28% disagree 27% Nots
sure so that means that more than half
of the
country wasn't really noticing that the
media had become the enemy hadn't
noticed now I didn't do the 25% thing
this time because the the disagree and
the not sure I think they should be
lumped together as more than half of the
country all right uh you can tell what
news people are watching if they're not
so sure that the media is a problem it
means they're only watching One Source
and they believe it's
true God I feel sorry for him well
speaking of the news I'm going to call
this
episode this next story Ducey versus
dummy so uh um is it
which Ducey is it Peter or Steve Peter
it's Peter duy right the young
one and uh he asked this of Ken John
Pierre um Biden is the sharpest before
800 p.m. so say that the Pentagon at
some point picks up an incoming nuke
it's 11: p.m. who do they call the first
lady who do they call the first lady do
you know what's funny about that
that that is the correct answer because
if you're going to wake up the president
and you know the president may have some
medical issues you're actually going to
call the first lady that is actually the
person you would call like no
joke absolutely seriously they would
call the first lady because she would be
the one to make the call whether the
president can make the call like if if
if you're in a hurry you wake up the
First Lady you say here's the deal do
you have any chance of getting him
coherent in the next 10 minutes and the
first lady says either yes or no but you
do call the first lady first that
actually was a perfect question and I
think it was right on point I do think
literally it wouldn't make any sense to
call the president
first especially if they're in the same
bed if they
are well Biden is so confident that
Google is biased that he says Google he
did a post on X that just said Google
project
2025 now that's the Heritage Foundation
has a big list of what they think a
conservative President should do if
elected Trump has said hey that's not my
plan you know my plan is this plan and
he gives the Republican platform now
there are some differences but also a
lot of overlap because it's Republicans
right of course one big plan by
Republicans is going to have a lot of
overlap in the ven diagram with any
other plan by Republicans but there are
some big
differences which uh of course Joy Reed
doesn't show when she shows them next to
each other she just shows the ones that
are the
same of course but imagine how how
biased Google must be that Biden can say
to Google project 202 so it makes it
sound like it's not him well it's not me
why don't you just Google it with
totally independent source and you'll
see all the you'll see all the totally
independent sources at the top of the
search list that will tell you you know
everything that I want you to know do
you do you think he could admit any
more
clearly that Google search is biased
that's all I hear I hear you can't trust
Google that's what that sounds like to
me well CNN said it's going to cut a 100
jobs and uh launch its uh first CNN
subscription product later this year to
which all of you just said what CNN
recently cancelled its subscri
subscription project called CNN plus so
what is it this new
one well let me give you some
insight I can't imagine how that would
work I don't know who would buy a
subscription to CNN but maybe we'll see
maybe they did some
research all right
um so remember uh I think I told you had
a conversation with Michael lean black
in which I had claimed provocatively
that uh all news is fake I double down
by saying all data is fake all data is
fake
now there there's some weird like
special exceptions to that you know if
you're if you're looking at the output
of a specific one
machine that might be right for example
if you were testing the highp speed or
the gas mileage of one engine in a car
yeah that might be right but most data
that we use for making big decisions you
know the employment data the you know
the inflation data GDP all that stuff
that's all fake now why do I know that
the reason I know it is that I worked in
an environment for many years my
corporate life in where in which it was
my job to put data together in a variety
of different you know projects and ways
and then tell management what the right
thing to do was based on the
data you don't have to do that that job
for long to learn that all data is fake
because I got to ignore the data that
didn't give me the answer I didn't want
I got to tweak the data with my
assumptions until I could make it do
whatever I wanted which was whatever the
bosses wanted it's all
motivated all data about the big
decisions of Life are motivated somebody
wants you to think something if I had
found data that was bad for my company
or my department would you ever see it
of course not of course not so let's say
I found some data that was accurate and
it was good for my department or good
for my company so then I publish it do
you say to yourself oh well sometimes
they publish real stuff so this might be
real well it might be
real but that's a
coincidence what's true is I'm only
going to tell you what's good for me
whether it's real or not right so if you
don't know that credibility and Truth
are different concepts no data is
credible that's a little different than
saying none of it is true
but if it's not
credible it's as useless and maybe
worse than if it were just
wrong it's it's both the same thing you
get to the same place you should not
make decisions using it whether it's
wrong or you can't tell because the
people gave it to you can't be trusted
here let me give you a specific example
to get to round this
out if my technology works over on um
all right this will be a adventure let's
see if my technology
works damn it is it really not
working all right I think it'll work
there we
go got
it uh and then you just disappeared so
let's see if this
works oh is it really not going to
work good Lord
oh my God I just want to shoot myself
right
now well I can make it work with but a
different way because I put it on my
phone so on
Instagram um I saw uh Dr Peter
petera uh with a diagram that shows the
let's see the health spending per capita
so how much health care is spending per
person and then life expectancy you see
that the us has a a relatively low life
expectancy but a the highest
spending so what does that tell you we
have the highest spending for the lowest
life expectancy of these major other
countries that we would be comparable
to so that tells you what what's your
conclusion is your conclusion that we
spend too much relative to what we get
is that your conclusion because I think
that's what Dr AA is telling you that
we're we're not very efficient that we
spend too much and we don't get enough
from our healthare is that what you see
in those
numbers well let me ask a few questions
and see if these came to your mind when
you saw them number one do you think
that all of these countries measure
healthc care spending the
same for example is cosmetic surgery
considered Health Care spending in
Japan or does Japan have as
much of it if it if let's say if
everybody put it in the number I don't
know if they do but would you put
optional Health Care spending in there
if you just spent your own money and
went to a a cosmetic
surgeon would that be in healthc care
spending the doctor does
it right I don't know but you don't know
either do you we don't know so what if
it's in some of these numbers in these
countries and others not because if you
look at the difference that big bar at
the top is the American spending if the
only difference if the only difference
was our cosmetic surgery that would be
most of the difference wouldn't it how
about this if you comparing let's say uh
Japan to the
US in Japan you have mostly
Japanese there far less they there's
actually a story today that Japan is
getting pro-immigration compared to the
past so they do have more diversity than
they ever had but still Japan is more
Japanese people in Japan you know uh
there's a high
percentage so should it does it make
sense to compare the outcomes of Japan
to the outcomes of the United
States not exactly if you're trying to
figure out if we're spending too much on
Healthcare you should look at just the
Japanese Americans shouldn't you if you
compare the Japanese Americans to Japan
do you think there would be a big
difference the answer is no there
wouldn't be I
checked so are we really spending too
much if the a if the Japanese Americans
living in America are living the same
amount as the Japanese were living in
Japan it's just other ethnicities who
aren't doing
well that that should be included I mean
that's got to be part of the analysis
but I don't see it how about the fact
that the black
Americans have high unemployment and
high crime rates and therefore and also
you know a lot of overdoses and uh death
by murder Etc if you took out just the
black population and looked at the rest
of
America would it look like this
or would our health our life expectancy
be
longer it'd be longer so part of what
your measuring is just that we have more
diversity than the other countries and
within that diversity you got groups
that have pretty good life expectancy
and people who have you know really
alarmingly low because of poverty and
violence and all the bad things so
that's not giving you a clear
picture how about
diet what about diet
we know that the the American diet is
unusually bad and we're unusually
obese would you expect to see way more
spending on health care and way less
good results if the only thing that was
different was we were eating and
the French were eating good
food and of course we've all heard the
stories that if you go to France or
Europe and you eat the bread you don't
get bloated and sick but if you eat the
same food in America because they use a
different process you feel terrible
immediately some
people so those are a few things um
let's
see and what about the quality of the
health care suppose uh let's take my
experience so I have Kaiser Permanente
so it's a HMO situation if I want to get
into to see my doctor I could pretty
much do it by today or
tomorrow today or tomorrow
and they could refer me to a
specialist and I'd get in there pretty
quickly I can get tests done just
because I want them I can email my
doctor get all kinds of tele medicine
can they do that in all the other
countries well I don't know but what I
do know is if you're comparing our
health care they're not they're not even
trying to do the same level of
service if if you have a national
healthc care they're going to make you
wait two weeks for an appointment
if you do it in America you're going to
pay extra and you're going to get in
faster now apparently that's not enough
to keep our life expectancy up but
here's my
point Peter AA very you know uh
respected
doctor but is he an expert on data
analysis and even if he were would he
know the assumptions that went into this
study and the answer is probably no and
no
so my point is that when I say all data
is it's this it's this if
you've worked with data you look at this
and you go well I can see three major
problems and I don't know anything about
healthc care spending or life expectancy
you simply have to have experience in
the domain of collecting data to know
that when you look at somebody else's
data you see three big problems and you
know that they didn't solve them because
they're probably not
solvable the databases of all these
countries probably not counting stuff
the same almost certainly not it would
be the rarest thing if the If This Were
apples and Apples to Apples so just take
that learning and say I'm not making a
case just about Healthcare and outcomes
I'm making a case that all data has this
problem that somebody who who's good
with data can see all the problems but
if you're not if you're not experienced
with data
looks right to you even if it's your
domain even if you're a doctor it looks
right to you and then let me end by
saying I don't know if any of the
criticism criticisms I just made are
valid for this study I don't know that
but what I do know is that it's not
credible because I don't know if they
did it because I don't know I I can't
take it
seriously even if it's right
I wouldn't
know well over in Sacramento the City
attorney has threatened Target stores
because Target keeps reporting retail
theft and they've reported retail so
many times theft so many times that the
that the government is having trouble
functioning because they're dealing with
all these reports of thefts and so
rather than solve the thefts they've
decided to let's see um they've issued a
warning to the Target store that it will
face f for reporting so many retail
theft
incidences so democrat or
republican see I'm going to use my
ESP was it a Democrat or Republican
entity that said the solution to
reporting so much crime is to stop
reporting it which would that be
Republican or
Democrat I'm going to go with
Democrat GNA go with Democrat
now I ask
you if you saw some crime data reported
in
California would you say to yourself
that crime data looks pretty credible or
if you had a little bit of experience
with data but you were no expert on
crime could you look at the crime data
and with what you knew about the world
say you know what I don't think they're
collecting the data the way they used to
do you know who would know that that
they're not collecting the data the way
they used to everybody who had
experience with data collection
everybody would know that if you're not
an expert in that domain you'd think
well these numbers look right to me but
they wouldn't look right to anybody who
knew the field of data
collection all
right Sam mman and Ariana Huffington are
teaming up uh on the effort to use AI
for some kind of Health outcomes
basically to be a a health coach to help
people change their lifestyle and their
habits to get rid of chronic
illnesses um I love this I don't know if
it'll
work but I love that powerful capable
people are working on um this to me this
is exactly right if it work if it works
that's great could you really change
lives if doesn't work it was still the
right thing to do right if this doesn't
work for whatever reason absolutely the
right place to put your energy and you
know I use chat GPT all the time now and
one of the things I think I can do that
I haven't tested yet is I'll bet I could
take a picture of a plate of food and it
could and just take pictures of
everything I eat during the day you just
basically every time I eat just snap a
picture of it and then at the end of the
day take those pictures up Lo him into
chat GPT and say how' I do today keep a
keep a running total of my nutrition I
think it can do that already I'm not
positive I don't know if you need a
specialize app but I'll bet I could do
it just by looking at
it so I'm thinking of doing that
actually uh Supreme Court Justice Sodom
um she lives in a neighborhood that
seems a little unsafe because her
bodyguards who are assigned to protect
secret um protect Supreme Court of
justices um somebody tried to carjack
their car outside her home and they
opened fire and shot the uh the
carjacker who
lived now I don't have much to say about
that except that there's an anti-gun
Supreme Court Justice who probably can't
take a walk in her own neighborhood
because of all the guns which she should
say probably would say
if you just make guns illegal we
wouldn't have this problem to which the
proun people would
say if we didn't make guns legal the bad
guys would have them and all of your
cars would be stolen so I guess we're
getting nowhere on that so uh Biden did
his NATO speech it was off the
teleprompter um he doesn't really know
the difference between uh putting
passion into his speech and anger at
this point
yeah so you know this is what passion
would look like and we've really got to
increase the GDP and we've got to help
Ukraine that's what passion would sound
like Biden can't get there he can only
do old man yelling at the the
sky oh oh we're gonna we're gonna raise
taxes we got to raise taxes raise taxes
on the
rich he's so far away from looking
normal but we got used to it didn't
we if you'd never seen all of this other
stuff and the only thing you saw was his
next speech and you didn't know about
the whole dementia thing you would say
to yourself why is he yelling what's
wrong with him but he's so far gone that
he can you know give a angry yelling
speech and people will say well at least
he didn't fall asleep that that looks
like a step in the right direction that
the bar is so low
anyway he did call the Secretary of NATO
and intellectual
wigger I don't know what that means he
looked right at him and he
said he's an intellectual wigger wi g g
r a
wigger what what was he reaching
for I don't think it was going to be an
ethnic
slur but what exactly was he trying to
say when it came out you're an
intellectual
wigger I guess we will never
know well Trump continues to be funny
and uh Kind of Perfect in his
campaigning so people are saying um that
he's he's doing a great job of letting
Biden's trouble be the top line
story so so instead of trump you know
making big news with some Poli policy or
something he he gives Biden a golf
challenge which is kind of perfect a
golf challenge because it's not
serious but it makes he reframes Biden
you know as feeble he said uh he
challenged Joe Biden to an 18-hole golf
match um and he was going to spot him 10
Strokes so he'd give him 10 strokes and
he said if Biden wins Trump will'll give
a million dollars to a charity of
Biden's choice now I think we all know
that Biden can't golf we all know that
right so Trump can make any offer he
wants for free it's just a free punch
and he can just say well look I'll give
you 10
strokes and a million dollars to a
charity you don't want your charity not
to get the million dollars do you all
you have to do is play around to golf
now of course he's not going to say yes
and of course he would lose if he did
so the fact that this is such a
nonserious topic but harmless it's just
a harmless non-serious topic it gives
Trump something to say which worked it
reframed Biden as you know physically
incapable uh but it wasn't such a big
deal that the Democrats have to respond
to it right and what could they say what
exactly could they say oh he will beat
you in Gulf I've seen him man in private
he golfs like
crazy yeah in private he shoots par it's
only when people are watching that he
slips up a little
bit all
right
um so uh Jen uh weager continues to be
hilariously um
normal and when you see a Democrat who
is acting all normal they they stand out
like a sore thumb you're like whoa
what's is he trying is he trying to be
normal and say things that make sense
and stuff so here's what he says the
Democrats are literally asking us to
vote for a person in mental decline for
president of the United States the whole
party must be in mental
decline yes Jen that is a normal smart
reaction to What You observe and boy
does he stand out all that normalness is
looking crazy but I would say it's not
so much a mental decline in the way that
Biden is mentally declining I would say
that there's a weird denial of reality
that happens on the left that is like
unlike anything I've ever seen and I
believe that they do they have
somehow created a fantasy world they can
live in just all the time so they live
in a fantasy world that Trump somehow
could conquer the country through the
force of his will plus his friends in
high places that's
crazy it's just crazy they they
fantasize that they can put together
this speed primary and and uh they put
that together no they can't that's not
going to happen and then they
fantasize that maybe Gavin Nome could
come in and be the head of the party no
we can't if you if you haven't noticed
that Nome could not possibly skip over
the Dei V president you haven't noticed
anything how could you know anything if
you don't know that no Gavin Nome was
never a possibility to be the head of
the ticket never so far away from being
possible that it's a
joke but I don't think that's from
mental illness I think that's Dei and
inability to see cause and effect and
inability to understand human motivation
inability to see things as systems
instead of goals
uh a complete denial of re Rel of
reality basically but not mentally
incompetent it just seems some kind of
weird selection
process
anyway um here's what uh CNN quoted
Trump talking about
kamla now here's a change how often does
Trump get quoted in full insulting KL
Harris or a Democrat it's sort of the
sort of thing that they wouldn't want to
say because it's sort of good for Trump
if it's a good insult so here's what
they quoted on CNN Trump saying what
whatever else can be said about crooked
Joe Biden you have to give him credit
for one brilliant decision picking kamla
Harris as his vice president was the
greatest insurance policy of all time if
Joe had picked someone even halfway
competent they would have bounced him
from his office years ago
it's so
perfect it's just
perfect I tell you that the Trump
campaign it he's just hitting every note
that is perfect it was so perfect that
CNN read it on the air because it's
perfect there's no hyperbole in it and
yet it comes off as hyperbole but it's
literally true it would be hard to argue
with the statement that if the vice
president were just you know clearly a
superstar by now the pressure to get rid
of Biden would have been through the
roof because everybody would say well
the Superstar can beat Trump better than
you can but people are looking at a
degraded mentally incompetent president
and saying you know what well you're
still better than Harris the fact that
even that's a conversation shows that
she is the perfect insurance policy
meanwhile Joy Reed continues her mental
breakdown in public and I don't mean
that as a
joke to me her her mental breakdown
actual form of some kind of insanity or
mental incompetence is very obvious and
if you tell me but Scott let's see your
diploma for being a you know some kind
of expert on Mental
Health have you been alive for the last
year
you realize this is the same thing
that's happening with the news being
surprised that Biden is not mentally
capable oh how about the fact that you
didn't have to be an expert and
everybody who wasn't a liar saw it on
day one I mean we've said for years that
Biden can't make it two terms and here
we are so don't tell me that Joy Reed is
not having a mental crisis she's having
a mental crisis it could not be more
obvious it's not a difference of
politics it's not a difference of
opinion what it looks like is that she
got brain or yeah she looks like she got
gaslighted by her own team it looks like
she believes her own
network same with Rachel
madow just listen to her for five
minutes and you can see extreme mental
health problems that are coming through
with her her work and by the way she
admits to uh you know lifetime of
depression
so she does have genuine mental issues
and you can see that this is making it
worse so to pretend that these are
opinions I'm really so done with that
right it's it's really not
about their opinions being different
that is just mental illness let's call
it out and by the way K Harris looks
drunk to me lots of times when she
appears in public and am I an expert on
addiction
nope but I can spot a drunk
I think you could too I do it actually I
do it all the time I spot drunks on X I
call them out for acting drunk you'd be
surprised how many times they get back
to me and say okay you got me I am drunk
because it's easy to spot you don't have
to be an expert I I've done it in public
a number of times recently where I say
you sound drunk and then they say okay
you got me I'm a little
drunk all right um
but uh don't get cocky so if you're so
smart that you saw Biden's
Decline and you're celebrating I'm so
smart I saw Biden's decline before the
news admitted it did you also think that
Nome had a chance to be the top of the
ticket because if you're bragging about
seeing that Biden wasn't
capable but you didn't know that new is
a white man who doesn't have any chance
of being the top of the ticket if you
didn't know that you can't brag if you
got them both right you could brag a
little I think that would be totally
appropriate if you got the Biden thing
right you got kamla Harris looks like
she has a substance problem and you
guess that the Democrats can never skip
the Dei vice president with the white
guy if you got all three of those
right then you're pretty smart or you
agree with me that's just as good um RFK
Jr was asked about
reparations he says that reparations are
not legal and that there was a Supreme
Court case that would that would confirm
that and he said the only way it could
ever um be legal or funded is if you
could somehow prove a direct connection
like you knew your DNA came from a slave
and you knew where you I don't know what
you'd have to know but you'd have to
know something specific
it would never be good enough that
you're just black and you live in the
United States so apparently the Supreme
Court ruled on something like that that
I didn't know about uh but RFK JR says
it's not an option but he says that
systemic racism against black Americans
is deeply embedded in our prison legal
system education system job Mark access
to Capital and
Beyond so he says the moral argument for
reparations is
compelling I
disagree I agree that the systemic
racism exists exactly as as he described
it that's not connected to the moral
argument for
reparations yeah here here's a better
explanation everybody's got some
wrong everybody's got a
problem that's it the the moral argument
doesn't exist because we all got
problems and all of us could trace it
back to somebody
else yeah you know think I could sue for
reparations I lost two jobs in Corporate
America for being a white male and my TV
show because they decided to have a an
all black Monday night lineup on UPN you
don't think I have a case for
reparations of course I do everybody
else does too that we all got problems
we all got problems and a lot of them
are somebody else's fault you just can't
run a country where if you got a problem
even if it's real and even if it came
from you know the system you can't you
can't give everybody reparations for
that I do agree with the direct ones
like the Japanese internment people were
still alive there were living people
alive who were in them I happen to know
several of them quite
well all
right
um so Duke Medical School uh some new
documentation for their Duke Medical
School uh they claim that white
supremacy culture is uh something you
want to get rid of and you want to get
rid of things like
uh dismantling racism and advancing
Equity the way they're going to do it is
get rid of these white supremacy work
culture things such as being on time uh
dressing
professionally uh your speech and your
workstyle and negative terminologies so
they're going to get rid of of all that
stuff it says that white supremacy
culture is the idea that or ideology
that white people and the ideas thoughts
beliefs and actions of white people are
superior to people of color and their
ideas thoughts beliefs and actions and
that's just wrong says
Duke um it says that that America is
rigged for the interests of white people
who get uh
Privileges and they get they're
unquestioned about their earned set of
advantages entitlements and benefits
bestowed on people solely because they
are
white well not in the country that I
live in in my country being white and
male is about the worst thing
that could happen to you and I wouldn't
wish it on
anybody but sure sure your problems are
bigger than mine how about that yeah
your problems are bigger so we'll do
everything your
way this is this is just dumb
 who got in power right whoever
it is who's arguing that to be black
means to not be on time and not dress
well for work it's just a
 let's not pretend this is some
kind of ideology right now there there's
C certainly something to it that there's
you
know that that there's some systemic you
know whiteness preferences built into
some things but there are so many things
that the non-white preferen is built
into it's not even close at the moment
it's probably 10 to1 against white men
probably 10 to1 in terms of the weight
of bias but is there a one yes yes there
is there there is definitely
discrimination and systemic racism that
affects black people and other minority
groups it's just that if you want to be
accurate in counting it this being my
theme my theme is that the data is all
motivated if you actually counted up how
many people lost a job this year because
of their color white men would win hands
down how many people know
that if you stop somebody in the street
and say is is a job discrimination by
race real they would of course say yes
because everybody knows it's real then
you would say all right were there more
uh diverse minority people who got
turned down for jobs or more white white
man the average person would probably
say oh minorities of course they would
probably be wrong by 10 to
one meaning it's not
close it's not close it's
10:1 it could be 100 to1 I don't know
probably not 100 to1 but it's probably
10:1 I think that's a fair
estimate all right um
Governor Whitmer does that funny thing
with body language where she says uh the
fact of the matter is that president is
Biden is showing that he's up to the
moment up to the job he's in it to win
it uh now my impression of her head
while she's saying it the fact of the
matter is the president is is showing
that he's up to the moment he's up to it
he's so good he's up to it and her head
is just shaken
though yeah that's one of the easy ones
the spot that in the wideeye
thing uh I think it was John Kirby who
did the wide-eyed thing talking to Brett
Bear yeah' say uh do you think the
president is you know capable of doing
the job and Kirby first looks down he's
like oh can't make eye contact like he's
preparing he's like oh yeah yeah yeah
totally good good uh and then and then
he does the wideeye thing he looks at
Brad Barry goes he's totally good
everything about him seems totally
normal I don't even see a problem he's
so
mentally acute or whatever that word is
I like to say
acuy it's hilariously bad body
language so the only hope that the
Democrats can win is to unite around
some kind of gaslighting idea because
apparently the Democratic caucus met and
uh they decided that they all hate each
other so if you are finding yourself
disliking Democrats here's the good news
for you Democrats agree they just think
it's the other Democrats that are
bad all right um last night on uh the
Five on Fox News uh Greg geld was um
amplifying the idea of trump should talk
directly to some democrat voters and get
it on video and I like the idea of a
lunch um where you edit it so it's so
it's not live uh but Trump just shows up
and talks to some Democrats and teaches
them that he's not heler and they can
ask anything they want and he'll just
answer and just go right to the people
because right now every Democrat is
being filtered through their news and
that's all they know all they know is
what their News tells them they need to
see a democrat in the real world having
a real conversation with a person who's
definitely not
Hiller because it doesn't take long to
figure out he's not a Hiller it takes
like a
second so let's see if anything comes to
that here's uh something that's uh
sounds dangerous but it's the only thing
that keeping you safe probably uh BAGI
sas's pointing out if we ever got in a
war with China do you know what's the
first thing they would do
they sto making our weapons for
us did you know that nearly maybe all of
our major weapon systems require parts
from China and we can't even make that
stuff just think about that our weapons
are made by China so if we got into any
non-nuclear war that was going to last a
while we'd have to ask them to keep
making our weapons hey I I know we're
having a war with you guys but I don't
think it's fair if we don't have weapons
so if you wouldn't mind could you send
us those spare parts that we could put
on our missiles because we got you know
we can make part of a missile we got
part of a missile well we're kind of
going to need those parts that you make
because we don't know how to make that
stuff so now you say to yourself but
that's terrible Scott because that makes
it more likely that China will go to war
cuz because they have control over our
weapons no it's opposite it's opposite
it probably keeps us safe because the
only war that you could have with China
is
nuclear do you get
that because they make our Conventional
Weapons and we can't make them without
them and therefore we couldn't win a war
of attrition there's only one war we
could win and nobody wins a nuclear war
so basically by making ourselves
crippled to China that we can't even
make our own weapons in sufficient
quantity it eliminates the option that
we're going to attack
them and do you know why they won't
attack us because we're their biggest
market so the only kind of War you could
ever have is a stupid War where you
decided to go nuclear and both die and
since nobody wants to do that the odds
of war with China are basically zero
basically zero because our economies are
just too tight and we're not going to
Nuke each other so I would love to see
Trump talk about the reality which is
look there is no scenario in which the
United States and China get into a war
there is none now of course they might
use their military and their local area
you know to put a little muscle and you
know try to try to nudge things that we
might try to use our muscle to nudge
them back but we're not going to get in
a war even if a war started the first
thing we do is stop it say whoa whoa
what are you doing stop that yeah
there's no chance of a war with China
none all
right um and I would say that uh so
China China has introduced their first
all robot Factory so they have what they
call a dark Factory dark meaning
literally they don't need to turn on
lights because the robots don't need
light
so they have you know Many Many Robots
building from scratch I think a phone
device I'm not sure I think it was a
phone but no
humans now you say to yourself but Scott
that's terrible because robots will take
all our jobs but I would argue the
following if robots can do the entire
Factory doesn't that mean that we could
have entire
factories making stuff that we can't you
normally make
the problem the reason that we don't
have uh American
manufacturing is largely because we lost
the skill but if robots are learning to
do that skill for us and AI can solve
let's say the paperwork and get things
approved because that's a pain in the
ass
to it could be the AI and robots brings
manufacturing back to every country so
there's no country that needs to have
some other country manufacturer because
the other country is just going to use
robots you can use robots
locally there there's no minimum wage
Advantage so as long as no people are
involved and looks like China's going to
put their own population out of work we
can just have robot factories and get
our manufacturing back so I think that's
going to
happen I think America needs to become a
vacation destination and needs to work
on it fast because I think we're going
to have some minimum um income
eventually because the robots will take
all the jobs and I think that people
still need something to
do so if you said to people like me okay
you're not going to have your normal job
but how would you like to I don't
know uh work in the restaurant that's on
the bike path so that people visit the
United States and they take a vacation
they're on their ebike running across
the country and they stop at your
restaur rest I would say actually that
sounds kind of fun I'd do that I I'd run
a restaurant on a bike path I I would
enjoy getting up and going to work
so I think and of course robots would do
the hard work in the restaurant too but
you still need some people in that
environment so to me it seems like we
need to figure out how to become a
vacation destination for the rest of the
world because we're not going to have
anything else that they need nobody will
nobody will have anything to sell except
experiences eventually so we need we
need to make America an experience and
one that everybody has to go to like
Mecca short of that I think we're in a
lot of trouble because what else do you
have to offer eventually nobody will
have anything to offer anybody because
the robots will bring the cost down so
far so either energy we either have to
be the biggest you know modular nuclear
power company
or AI or robot makers but there aren't
that many jobs in the
future anyway the Gaza here that was a
disaster is going to be taken down
that's the whole story the problem is
that that Gaza Pier that the US built to
deliver stuff to Gaza is Visual and it
was a failure you don't want to do
something that's both Visual and a
failure so they finally just said all
right we can't have more pictures of
this thing being a debacle we're going
to have to clean it up and they're just
going to take it away for another
bazillion dollars all right ladies and
gentlemen probably ran really long
didn't mean to do it I'm GNA say bye to
uh X and YouTube and Rumble and I'm
going to talk to my beloved subscribers
for a little
bit uh privately so see you tomorrow
hope you enjoyed it bye for
now we private and local
[Music]
in oh shoot it's not
working
oh all right so the button's not working
so all of the shows that I just did will
be deleted because they can't end so if
the studio Falls you know when the
rumble Studio can't kill them I have to
kill them so that they don't run forever
which means that the recorded versions
will be deleted so every everything you
saw uh you're not going to be able to
watch later um on locals we won't have
to delete it on locals it'll be a fine
but I think X I have to delete I might
be able to save it on Rumble and
YouTube but X I'll have probably have to
delete it otherwise it just runs forever
I can't stop it all right I'll see if I
can end even any of the
stream nope
all right so not only can I not go to
locals but I can't end the
stream so I'm going to have to just
leave the studio and then kill the
streams that I can kill
separately oh wait maybe it works nope
didn't
work all right see you back here
tomorrow e
