good morning everybody
how's everybody today good
good
would you like to enjoy something called
the simultaneous sip and uh start your
day off
in a way that
i don't know it's just the best thing
ever
probably
probably you do and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass a tanker chelsea
stein
a canteen jugger flask of vessel of any
kind
except for
a russian tank we'll talk about that
later
turns out that russian tanks are a
vessel that
maybe not hold your coffee so well
and
would you like to join me now for the
dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's
it's amazing your oxytocin is already
starting to rise are you ready for this
can it get any better no it cannot go
yeah
it feels like a
tickle on the neck
it's like a sneeze in the forest it's
like
it's like your favorite food when you've
been starving that's how good the
simultaneous sip is
and believe me if that is that good
imagine how much the content
will delight you
well more than i can even express
let's talk about that
so
i was accused of being insensitive from
making the following comment on twitter
that uh now when i see masked people
if they're alone
alone in the car or just walking alone
somewhere obviously just exercising
taking a walk
i no longer think
that those are cautious people
or immunocompromised
i kind of think that it's signaling a
some type of mental illness
now people said you're unkind you're
unkind no i'm not
i'm literally showing empathy
maybe i don't do it well
do i do it wrong
i'm showing empathy i'm not judging them
or disliking them i'm saying
i'm deeply alarmed
how many people are in my opinion
my uneducated non-expert opinion are
signaling an actual mental illness
that probably has great consequence in
their lives
now i imagine a lot of them are germ
phobes
imagine
just imagine how hard it would have been
to be a germ phobe
germaphobe
going through the pandemic
what could have been harder than that
i mean that's like
that's like a you know a disaster that
was designed just to torture a certain
group of people
especially hard
so no i have only empathy for them but
the shocking part so this is not about
hey you people take off your masks
that's been done to death so i'm not
giving an opinion whether they should
take them off or not
that's their business i'm just saying
that i'm alarmed
at what looks like the most visible
signal yet
of mental illness
because a lot of mental illness
is invisible right unless you know the
person personally
you don't necessarily see it
you know they're just walking down the
streets and the mentally ill
look exactly like everybody else for the
most part
but if they have to put out an article
of clothing
that indicates they're in that group of
people which unfortunately is gigantic
who are having serious
life affecting mental illnesses and when
you see a visually like this
at least that's what it says to me
now some of you are saying scott scott
scott they just left their mask on
because they're walking from one place
to another no i'm not talking about
those
i'm not talking about the people in the
parking lot at the grocery store
or actually at the parking lot let's say
the doctor's office
yeah i mean
they just walked out and forgot to take
their mask off
but
for the most part i'm talking about
people walking
for recreation just away from everybody
i'm talking about people in their car
alone
i know i i think that that is not a case
of people who are immunocompromised in
most cases
i think that's something else
well here's a new wrinkle in the
desantis versus disney thing apparently
there's some kind of clause in their
agreement where disney got this
special uh control over their own
territory
um apparently if florida takes over
for
disney they would also take over their
debt
so florida would have to accept a
billion dollars in debt
that disney itself was somehow
satisfying
and so i say to myself huh
didn't see that coming
[Laughter]
now
i don't necessarily mean to think that
that means they can't it can't work
because if it's a bond debt and
something is servicing it so i assume
that they would get whatever is
servicing it
as well as the debt itself
so you shouldn't necessarily stop the
deal but it might slow it down
because they have to work that out
so we'll see maybe there is some
technical reason why this can't happen
that nobody saw until now
let's talk about canceling student debt
which by the way
isn't a real thing
you don't really cancel debt
when you hear that word people think oh
hey there's an idea
why don't you take this thing that is
bad this debt
and just make it go away
just cancel it
cancel it's just a word
just just take out your books and just
just delete that number why not
why not if it's bad and you can cancel
it
why wouldn't you cancel something that's
bad
right am i right it's as simple as that
about death
nobody likes death
here's what i say
cancel it
why don't we cancel it
oh if you're pro-death go ahead and
argue that point you fascist
not me i want to cancel it
how about cancer we've been trying to
come up with cures for cancer done
pretty well actually but there's still a
lot
that are incurable
until now
cancel it
just cancel it
how about that the war in ukraine
looks like an impossible situation
doesn't it
not so much not so much can anybody
guess how i would
fix the problem in ukraine take a guess
cancel it i'd cancel it because when you
cancel something it just goes away
it's kind of brilliant
are there any other problems we can just
cancel and make them go away
no you're not cancelling
the debt
that's not a thing
you're just transferring it
you're transferring it from the people
who
got the benefit and made the decision to
take on the debt
to the people who paid off their debt or
didn't go to college or paid or or have
similar problems of a different nature
and don't need your problem
that that goes somewhere
that if the if the person who borrowed
it doesn't pay it back
well then the lender eats it
i mean it's not it's it's sort of a
you know a less direct way but the the
lender's still going to eat it
right money doesn't just
disappear
you know i mean debt that doesn't just
disappear
somebody loses
uh and you know for a fact the bank will
will not be eating the debt
i'm saying
somebody eats all debt i don't know who
it is
you know in this case i assume it's the
taxpayer right
how could it how can it be anything else
is there any model other than the
taxpayer would
eat it
now
it doesn't mean that they eat it
as in
a normal way
it could be that it's just an asset they
thought they have that they no longer
have
so if you say i have an asset called
people are going to give me a trillion
dollars or 1.7 trillion
so my asset is
i have this 1.7 trillion dollars that
people owe me
and then suddenly they don't
you've lost 1.7 trillion in value
and that's got to be taken into account
when you figure out your total budget
etc
because that's money that's not coming
in
so
[Music]
as long as we allow
the people who want to do this
to call it canceling a debt
then all the dumb people are going to
think well that's free
why not
well let's let's get some of that
cancellation going
we we've got it it's got to change to
you know
move the debt to those who did not move
it i call it a theft
because i
you know i get that it could be
legalized because the government if they
make it legal then technically it's not
that
but is theft in
in effect is it not
it feels like it
if it feels like theft and
walks like a duck and talks like a duck
somebody said that to me online the
other day if it walks like a duck and
talks like a duck
must be a duck
to which i say
only if you haven't been alive for the
last five years would you think that
today if it walks like a duck and talks
like a duck it's probably fake
news
am i right
things that look exactly the way they're
supposed to be are almost always wrong
now
in the old days if it looked like a duck
and quack like a duck well yeah yeah i
mean there was a good chance that was a
that was a freaking duck
but in 2022
you could take the d you could take
the dna of the duck
and you still wouldn't be sure
because you'd be like i don't know who
took that dna
do you have a chain of custody
i feel as if the
dna test of the duck might have been
rigged
right
so there's nothing we believe anymore so
if it walks like a duck and quacks like
a duck
it doesn't mean a damn thing
it means nothing
maybe it never did but it definitely
doesn't mean anything in 2022.
all right
well so here's let me do a
i think it's called a steel man argument
so here's the argument for canceling the
net
you ready
so i'm i'm opposed to it
but don't you think it's interesting to
hear the best argument on the other side
would anybody find that offensive
because i know we like to you know
play as a team all right here's the best
argument
for for canceling the debt
why
why did the people take on the debt
go
the people who took on the debt why did
they do it
did they do it from something called
free will
did they look at the
situation
and just like you did and i did in some
cases
did they make a decision and their
decision maybe was different than yours
but
and now they think they want to they
don't want to pay it back
is that what happened
well here's my argument
do you know why children grow up to
think that education is important who
told them that
the system
sure their parents told them that too
who told their parents
the system the government education
system the education system tells people
that education is good
and that they should go get some
they should go to college
so
every one of those people who borrowed
money from the government
was brainwashed by the government
from childhood
to borrow that
money it's a better argument than you
thought isn't it
i'll bet you didn't see that coming
no they were literally brainwashed i
mean it literally
literally
literally the way literally is actually
supposed to be literally used
they actually were brainwashed
easy to prove
i mean
you could get any expert to say
what happens when you take
young children and consistently tell
them that education is good and the
college is the best of all
and it's so good
that you should do anything you can do
to get there because
don't even let money stop you damn it
it's that good if you can get if you can
do it now of course not every kid is
you know ideally suited for a college
track
so those kids were
brainwashed
but it didn't matter because their track
was not going to go in that direction
but for those people who were let's say
they had the capability to get good
grades
and the capability to go to college at
least in terms of scholastic achievement
those people were all brainwashed
how many of them were told you know
if you just get a good trade education
and learn things that you need to learn
on your own just as good
almost none of them
do you think there was any teacher in
any school that said look kids
education is highly
you know highly prized in our society
but realistically
realistically
if you learn to trade
and it was the right trade and
you you work hard
you do great
because lots of people do
there are tons of people who just do
great
without a college education
so who told the kids that
was that a message that those kids were
getting no
they were literally brainwashed
so when brainwashed people get alone
whose fault is that
is that the fault of the person who got
the loan
well you could argue that it's the fault
of the system that
hypnotized them and you and i are all
part of that system
especially if you're an adult if you're
an adult
you are supporting the system that
brainwashed children into getting loans
they can't pay back
so you do have some responsibility
but wait
isn't that what the muggers say too
they do don't they
it's not me
it's society
i was born into a system
that did not give me a fair chance
so what could i do i guess i became a
mugger
so the counter to my argument my
excellent argument that children were
brainwashed into getting these is that
you unfortunately you can use that
argument for just everything
everybody's brainwashed into everything
because it's true
it's literally true again literally used
the way it literally is meant to
literally true
it doesn't mean there's an intention
involved but the effect is brainwashing
all right there's no no right answer
here this is just a power play but i do
wonder what would be the benefit
of getting this
through before an election happens
suppose biden and the democrats are
successful
and they get this push through before
the midterms
is there any point to it
what would be the political point of
doing it before the election
because
let's say young people are primarily the
ones with these loans
have you
met a young person
name a name a young person who gets a
benefit already
and then months later you say hey you
already got your benefit it's really
basically the only thing you cared about
but also i'd like you to take a day off
from work or whatever and go go vote
i don't think they care
i think once they got their benefit
they're done
i don't believe that's a reason to vote
do you
do you think people are gonna say oh
the democrats gave me the one thing i
wanted so i'd better vote for them no
they already got it
i'm not sure exactly
how it works politically
are you
because it's not like
it's not like passing the infrastructure
bill or something like that where you
say to yourself oh that's an
accomplishment
that's an accomplishment oh good you did
something for the whole country that's
good but if you just give something to
somebody and it's a one-time deal
well then they just have it
it's no longer part of the
decision-making is it
i mean you want the competent leadership
but i think you would just call that a
one-off and say yay
pocket the money and
you wouldn't change your vote one bit i
don't think
all right here's a statistic i saw that
three-quarters of this student debt is
held by
do you know the answer this
what demographic holds three-quarters of
the student debt
no that's the wrong answer
women the answer is women
so women are three-quarters of the
student debt
which means that the democrats will
forgive the debt
if you were going to predict
what the democratic party will do
all you have to do is look at what's
good for 75 of women
and i feel like they're just going to be
drawn to that it's going to be too
important
maybe they'll forgive the debt for women
only
no white men
do you think it's fair that white men
also get their debt forgiven
it seems unfair doesn't it
because
i wonder what the racial composition of
the debt holders is i'll bet is mostly
white isn't it
am i wrong about that
is most student held by white people
how come that wasn't reported
why is it that i saw an article saying
75 of it is women
but the same article didn't mention the
ethnic breakdown which seems
really really important
would the entire thing be killed if the
republicans point out it primarily helps
white people
it kind of would wouldn't it
yeah
i mean
am i wrong
if the ethnic mix of ra of
student loans is is uh overweighted with
white
um
debties
debtors what do you call them
debtors
all right well that can be interesting
yeah and it's very interesting that we
are denied that knowledge when we're
given such related knowledge it makes it
look intentional doesn't it makes it
look yeah debtors thank you it makes it
look intentional
that we don't know the racial
background
it's weird
all right um
i saw a comment from a twitter user
patrick chauvinik
and he tweeted this um
talking about putting trump back on
twitter
and he was pointing out it's not it's
not just a free speech issue
that trump was booted off twitter for
more than his opinion and this is the
way patrick says it he says it is worth
noting that twitter banned donald trump
from the site in the media aftermath of
the mob attack he inspired on the
capitol on jan 6. it's not as though
they just disapproved of his opinions
what do you think of that
do you think that trump was booted off
twitter for his opinions
or was he booted off because of
inspiring the
mob attack on the capitol
and
does that matter
does it matter
well
here's what
i i tweeted back i said uh this is the
type of common misinformation
that a musk owned twitter could correct
you know potentially
so i said here's a fact check it is
legal and appropriate to inspire a
protest
to demand an audit of an election that
looked rigged to about half the country
fake news calls that an insurrection
now
i'm going to say that uh patrick
chauvinik
is probably somebody who follows the
news
but if he followed the news that was you
know
rightly or i'm sorry left leaning
he would think that there was an
insurrection and that the president um
inspired that insurrection
correct
and that would be the common opinion of
people who
consumed cnn and msnbc
but it's not true
it's just not the case
the cases that
trump inspired
he inspired a protest which is
completely legal
it's protected speech
and the protest was to protect
the election
because it was such a strong intuition
that it had been rigged and so obviously
from the perspective of the republicans
now i'll agree that the courts have seen
no evidence to to prove that case
the courts have seen no evidence
you may have seen some evidence that you
think proves it but the course have not
that's all i know i mean i don't know if
anything happened or not i just know
that has been hasn't been proven in the
courts
but also that doesn't tell you much
it's just a true statement
all right
so
if you were patrick you probably did not
know
that although there were certainly some
bad actors in the group
had anybody ever explained to you that
if it had been intended to be an
insurrection
it would have been armed
and it wasn't i mean except for some
clubs and some random stuff like bear
spray i guess
if the plan had been an insurrection
there would have been weapons
and secondly
how do you take over a country by
occupying a building
like
who's whose news source ever explained
that to patrick patrick
even if they had weapons which they
didn't
even if they had planned to take over
the country for which there's no
evidence whatsoever because 100 of what
everybody was saying is hey we think the
election was rigged
can you give us two days to look into it
and that's what everybody wanted
right um
now whether that was legal or not
is separate from the fact that they were
they were trying to get it done
uh
and
you know the the entire thing was just
completely
different from the way the left
portrayed it and i wonder if an elon
musk twitter
could help people like patrick
who are so who are so poorly served by
their
their media
now i've said this before that people on
the right
almost always know the news on the left
because it's so
so pervasive the left leaning news is
everywhere
and the people and the news on the right
tends to react to the news on the left
so you've got a good
good balance there you see it all if you
watch the right you tend to at least be
exposed to both sides but if you watch
only the left
they won't even tell you that the hunter
biden laptop is real
you're not getting anything like the
news
you're just getting complete
now that's not to say that the news on
the right is all correct
nobody would make that claim
but there's a real a real difference and
and how much their
viewers are exposed to the opposite
arguments
all right
um
so
did i see in the news that the biden
administration
is creating a ministry of truth
or i think it's a department
there's going to be a department in
homeland security
to create a disinformation governance
board
dedicated to quote countering
misinformation
really
you know this this is where the people
like me who say don't worry about the
slippery slope
there will always be something that pops
up to stop things from slipping too far
yeah i mean things always do go too far
but then they correct
i would say critical race theory and
some of that stuff is probably going too
far and it's in the process of
self-correcting
but
i have to admit i am actually completely
surprised that we got all the way to the
the ministry of truth
where the government
will pretend
to tell you what is true and what is not
and i thought
honestly i mean it just looks like a
joke doesn't it
now
how could it possibly work
and what would they do
because if what they do is fact checking
that's not going to work
is it
the the government is exactly the entity
you expect to lie especially if they're
associated with a political party
you know if they're associated with a
political party they should be the most
lying is people in the game
history
suggests so when you take the most
lyingest people
playing loosely with language here
and you say we'll take the people who
are most definitely the biggest liars in
the world
we'll staff it with some people who have
a history of actually
some sketchy behavior
when it comes to the truth
just to make it have no credibility
whatsoever and we'll put it under the
homeland security to make it sound scary
and important to make it even sound more
evil than anything we've ever done in
the history of the united states
i would be worried about this
except that it's so ridiculous i don't
know how anybody will ever take it
seriously
what i worry about is if it's more than
fact-checking
what happens if they start leaning on
private companies
because what else what else is their
mission
suppose they start leaning on fox news
and say you know yeah
the uh
the what do they call them the uh the
disinformation governance board has
ruled that uh tucker carlson can't frame
frame the issue that way
what
how's that going to go down
like what what exactly does this entity
do if they're either going to try to
persuade private industry to say
different things
or they're going to be fact checkers and
not all of that's worthless
how in the world cause it could this
work
it's it's sort of mind-boggling and i
feel like it's just giving something to
the republicans
there have to be some democrats who
still like freedom
i i have to think that this is the sort
of thing that that carves off another
one percent of democrats or independents
maybe just you know this is like a one
percent deal
like you just you just lost one percent
of your side with this didn't you
you don't think even one percent
of the democrats
are looking at this and saying uh
yeah
i kind of like democrat policies but uh
the disinformation governance board
really
now you say they're they're brainwashed
but i say
yeah 99
but i feel like one percent
just one percent would say ah that's too
far
maybe i'm an optimist
well here's something interesting
chinese drone maker dji that's the
biggest drone making company
so i think by far the biggest percentage
of drones
is made made by this one chinese company
dji so the ukrainians were using them
but now
i guess there's a pullback because there
was some glitch in the software
that somehow gave russians
some advantage some information about
the drones
and so
so china makes the drones they sell them
to
their allies enemy that's ukraine
but they actually work
to help the russians identify something
so
yeah
it's pretty much exactly the way you'd
imagine it would go
so i guess they're they're going to pull
back from supplying them all right so at
this point the ukrainians do not do not
have enough
shoulder
missiles so they don't have anti-tank
missiles enough
they because they're not made anymore so
whatever the world's supply is of those
probably the available ones are already
being sucked up so they're going to run
out of the good missiles
they're going to run out of i think the
turkish drones the good ones you know
the the big ones their air force is
probably down to not much of anything
and now their drones which were really
sort of their secret weapon
may also
be depleted
i don't know how many they have but
they're not getting more
so
how does putin lose this
and and it seems to me that russia would
be able to resupply
better than ukraine eventually
in the short run maybe not but
eventually i would think russia would be
able to get their supply lines up and
running
so i saw a retired general mccaffrey on
fox i guess
say that uh he thinks russia will
basically own ukraine in 90 days
so 90 days
ukraine will own beyond what do you
think
do you think ukraine will go in 90 days
or do you think there'll be a permanent
guerrilla force that'll be so
so powerful that uh russia will always
have to just stay in their little bases
yeah
i don't know well if there's one thing
you can predict about a war it is
what's the one thing you can predict
about wars
they always last longer than you think
don't they and they're unpredictable
right
that they're unpredictable in general
but the one thing you can predict is
they never they never end when you think
they're going to end
so
who knows
and i wonder who's going to pay for the
rebuilding of ukraine
isn't it better for the united states if
putin takes it over
sorry
but i'll just ask an honest question
if if ukraine let's say wins
in the sense that they stay independent
who's going to pay to rebuild them and
then rearm them
isn't that us
it's us right
because who else is going to do it
ukraine doesn't have money and we're not
going to just leave them there as rubble
because if we leave them as rubble
they'll just get re-attacked
putin will just take a year and go back
and do it again because it's just rubble
by that time
so it seems to me that if the united
states and europe win meaning ukraine
survives that's going to be really
expensive
and what will we get in return
what do we get in return
i can't think of anything can you
i can't think of anything
so
now let's say that uh russia conquers
ukraine and owns it
who pays for rebuilding ukraine
once russia owns it
russia
well you know the the part about the
wheat is the cheapest part because
that's just like tractors and
tractors and roads and grain storage
right
so i don't think that's like the big
expense the big expense is eight million
people just
you know
i mean the whole economy is broken
basically
um
so
i hate to bring this up
i hate to bring this up but
the united states is better off if
ukraine loses at this point
because there's nothing left of ukraine
and
and if russia broke it they got to buy
it right
yeah you broke it you bought it
so would the united states and europe be
better off if russia is crippled by its
conquest of russia i'm sorry of ukraine
even though putin would get what he
wants wouldn't it basically make russia
an ineffective fighting force for a long
time
because they just wouldn't have the
money
and and i think there will be a
long-term
move toward squeezing them out of the
energy game
so i feel as though
the united states may have cynically
played
an unusually effective game here
if our goal was to degrade russia
and and just take them off the
the page
if that was the goal
then it looks like
well played
but if that was not the goal
uh well then it was just a gigantic
mistake
so
i i think we we have to start asking a
tough question which is is the united
states better or worse off
if if ukraine loses
and i'm not saying that you know i don't
have empathy for the ukrainians
but i don't also don't know what's good
for them i just don't know what's better
for them
at this point
well i saw on
cnn that
russian tanks have a little problem
which is they're very explodey
so there's a design flaw in the russian
tanks
say the experts
where a minor hit on the tank will
explode the munitions and then the
munitions will blow the turret you know
two stories in the air and obviously
kill the people who are within it
so it turns out
that a tank
is the least safe place to be
if you're in the russian military
because any kind of a serious hit on the
tactics makes it explode
on its own
and i guess the u.s tanks don't do that
i mean i don't know how you protect
munitions
in a tank but i guess i guess there's a
better way to do it and they do it the
bad way
so russia might be losing a lot of tanks
but do they need all those tanks
to control ukraine
scott doesn't like cnn he loves it they
say
on the comments
uh just the t-72s i heard that uh all
even the newer russian tanks have the
same design flaw
the older the old ones and the new ones
have the same design flaw that's what i
read this morning
all right
um
somebody's mentioning elon musk he
should buy dominion
software next
that would be interesting all right
let's talk about twitter do you believe
that
do you believe that at twitter
people are
quickly changing the algorithms and
stuff
uh so that nobody finds out what that
what happened do you think that's
happening
but you don't think that would be easily
discoverable
that it had happened
uh
i did hear an insider report
from twitter
that suggests there's some
there's some sabotage going on
but i don't know what that means
has anybody heard anything like that
from insiders
there must be plenty of people on here
who know somebody who works at twitter
have any insider say
said there's any sabotage going on
um
yeah i'd be surprised if there were not
any
rumors yeah
i don't know what that would look like
i suspect
i suspect that might be overblown it
sounds like the sort of thing people
talk about doing but don't do
because you would it's just too easy to
discover i can't imagine it'd be worth
it
when clinton left office and his staff
took all the w's on the keyboards
yeah i mean maybe a little stuff like
keyboards and stuff
all right
let me get rid of this commenter
let me just make a general comment uh
for people who want to talk about my
personal life
here's the thing you need to know
when people get married it's usually
because they both want to
and people when people get divorced
it's usually for the better
it's because something wasn't working
it's not bad news it's not something
that needs to be fixed
it didn't need to be
fixed before it doesn't need to be fixed
now
so uh while i appreciate that you have
interest in it
don't assume there's a problem that
needs to be fixed
that there's no basis for assuming that
don't assume that we're not both happier
don't assume that everything is defined
and remember by the time that you hear
about anything it's already old news to
the people involved right so by the time
anybody
you know not close to me
heard about any of this
it was already something that we'd
processed for a long time right
so
i'm fine
i'm actually in a real good place and
i think she is too i don't know we don't
really communicate
but i think she's fine
i think i'm fine too
so there's not really a problem to solve
here and
so you don't need to you don't need to
be obsessed on that you can let that go
okay
um
i i see your questions and i'm not going
to respond to them
just assume everything's fine
it's fine
or will be like
yeah
i don't think either of us are suffering
any loneliness
i don't think any of us
we'll be fine
all right
that's right
salisbury hill
and
let's talk some more about elon musk's
uh
tweets
what do you tweet
i feel like i wrote it down and i
lost it somewhere oh he tweeted next on
buying coca-cola to put the cocaine back
in
how much do you love him
he
he just keeps making me love him because
he
he doesn't take seriously
things that should not be taken
seriously
and he does take seriously
the things that are most important
like saving the planet and
you know uh
extending consciousness into mars and
space and i mean he takes those things
pretty seriously then free speech
yeah i don't think anybody's taking free
speech more seriously than he is
but when it comes to like the criticisms
of the you know how seriously any of
this should be
i like the fact that he doesn't take any
of it seriously the stuff that doesn't
need to be taken seriously
that is just
so refreshing
because what we're used to is people
being serious about non-serious stuff
and not being serious about really
serious stuff
he's literally the opposite of everybody
on twitter
am i wrong
because he takes seriously the big big
big stuff like ai
i mean he's talking about artificial
intelligence you know being dangerous
and
you know uh bringing humans to off
worlds and
i mean that's the big big stuff
the important stuff
and then you know somebody's joke on
twitter and
this little stuff
he just thinks it's funny
that's exactly what you would want to
emulate
um he had some other funny tweets and
the the thing that is really blowing my
mind is how many people he's responding
to
have you have you seen that yet
um so he's responded to
mike cernovich directly
he's responded to a number of people
that you probably follow
and they're not the biggest
biggest accounts in the world i mean
ceravich is one of the biggest accounts
in terms of influence
and
i just love
how
personal he's made twitter
because you feel like you know he's the
the richest guy around right in the
world or the country whatever it is
so he's the richest guy
he's doing the most you know important
things
but you could just tweet at him
and there's a pretty good chance he'll
respond
at least this week because he's having
fun with it apparently and it's just
sort of amazing
just watching it is just mind-blowing
but you want to have your mind blown
again
remember elon musk
is a promoter of the idea that we live
in the simulation
he is probably the best example of it
because he lives it like it's a
simulation
it's like he whatever he wants done he
just makes it happen and the simulation
seems to give it to him
am i right
but here's something that i always say
about the simulation has code reuse he
uses the same characters over and over
again
and the same themes over and over again
what are the odds that the two biggest
stories in the news
would be
elon musk and whatever he's doing today
and johnny depp
right those are the two biggest stories
seems like at least the ones that
involve personalities johnny depp and
elon musk
and they both
they both dated amber turd
what are the chances of that
that the two people who are seeming to
control our consciousness at the moment
both dated the one the same person
that amber turd
that's weird isn't it
am i right
and apparently there's a name for this
eskimo brothers
have you ever heard that term i had to
look it up so it's like an urban
dictionary slag
so eskimo eskimo brothers means
uh when basically anybody sleeps
together just for warmth so it could be
could be your brother it could be your
brother's wife you know it could be
anybody but so like anybody will sleep
together
if you're cold enough
so so the elon musk and johnny depper
eskimo brothers because they both slept
with amber turd
uh anyway
[Laughter]
they're turd brothers
yeah
that's pretty funny
um so is there a story i missed
i'm not going to look that up on
so somebody gave me something else to
look up and i don't think i'm going to
look that
up but i'm going to tell you what it was
upper deck
what does upper deck mean
damn it i got to look it up now
i know something filthy that's why i got
to look it
up okay uh up her dick
is this going to be terrible
wait a minute i i look at your comments
but does that really
uh
[Laughter]
all right well we'll let that go
i'm going to assume that what i'm seeing
here on the comments is probably true
i don't know why that's so funny
but it is
that's just comes out
uh
definitely don't look up rusty trombone
do not look that up
do not look up rusty trombone
let me warn you
that's just a warning
and trust me
if you don't already know what it means
don't look it up
or dirty sanchez
all right i i feel bad because i know i
just made a bunch of you look up
horrible
things that you'll now have in your
minds
well that's on me
uh all right is there anything else we
need to talk about today
let's have a
let's have a gratuitous simultaneous sip
i'm going to look at your comments for a
moment shall we
i'm from florida try the seagull trust
me
okay
uh
oh uh
elon elon musk also tweeted that
truth social was a terrible name
and that uh
it should be called trumpet
and the problem is that
you know i don't think trump wanted it
to be like
a trump-branded thing because i don't i
don't think that would necessarily have
helped him so i disagree from a branding
perspective but i agree from a naming
perspective that trumpet would you know
would have been a better name
my goodness
who wants me
oh okay
all right um
yes it's time for bagels
war winners are invariably stronger
after the war
um okay we have a comment that the
winners of wars are
invariably stronger after the war well
let's test that
so invariably
means historically
and
and
so let's take
learning from history
is it true that the winners of war no
matter how degraded they get when they
win the war
will end up ahead having won the war
i would agree
that that would be the long-term outcome
because ukraine seems to be valuable
enough
that eventually putin will be out of
office or maybe we'll forget what
horrible things he did and
russia will re-enter the
economy at some point
and probably come out ahead i think i
think i would agree with that so i'm
going to agree with it on a concept
level
but i'm going to argue about the timing
because i think as long as putin is
there or somebody who's putin-esque i
guess
i think that they will be economically
degraded in a way they would not have
been had they not won the war
had they not entered the war at all
so i'm going to argue that
they will be worse off for as long as
putin is there
but i would agree with you
that having russia and ukraine together
probably makes a stronger
russia in the long long term let's say
the the 30-year term i agree
in the
20-year future
if putin stays i think russia's worse
off
but
who can protect predict such things all
it would take is a reversal on the
sanctions and and then nothing's
predictable after that
you forgot china's role i didn't forget
it
give me
um
i'll put zelinski in charge of russia no
i don't think that'll fly
because i think yeah that's like a fly
uh russia would be fine because they
have resources the world needs badly
true
that that's what keeps them uh from
being completely dissolved
but
will not the uh ukraine situation cause
people to work twice as hard
maybe ten times as hard
to have alternative sources to russia's
resources
i say yes
so i think that um
russia
may have the ability to sell but
yeah i suppose
i guess
for
decades there's going to be a market for
all the energy they can produce
maybe only the maybe only the richest
countries will be the ones who have
alternate alternative
sources um
they have their own energy and food that
is correct
so apparently russia is pretty
self-sufficient
but
uh if you take away their energy trade
it's not the same country
um
countries will work to avoid nato's
fears of influence will they
i don't know not according to peter's
and what does peter say have to say
about what
i'd be interested in that
the ruble is uh
up yeah so the ruble
ruble's hanging in there
when your printer doesn't work it's your
network that needs to be reset not the
printer
sometimes
that is correct
yeah i usually can identify one that's
the network problem and
i i will do both
but that's a good point i should i
should reset my
wi-fi
just as one of the things to try all
right well i've run out of things to say
clearly
and although this was a highlight of
your day and maybe civilization itself
um
i think it's time that we
take this to a
conclusion and i don't know that you
could be happier could you
no you couldn't be you couldn't be
happier best thing ever all right
i'll talk to you tomorrow
