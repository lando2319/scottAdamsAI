um
hey everybody come on in come on in
now if I were to ask you
what would be the best moment of your
entire life
well it'd be hard to come up with that
answer maybe you'd be thinking about the
birth of your children maybe a big
promotion you got maybe the day you got
married
but no the best day of your life
it's right now
and
if you'd like to make this even better I
know it's it's hard to believe but you
can just a little bit better uh all you
need is a copper micro glass tanker
towel stand I can't even drink a flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and you're about to
experience it and you're lucky if you
are and it happens now go
oh yeah oh yeah
well Trump is back in the news so uh
everything's looking a little brighter
now
I guess he had some log interview
yesterday with Fox News he was on news
backs and
a lot of blotta so it looks like we'll
have a steady diet of trump
and so far he's not making a lot of news
he's just complaining about Biden
uh which makes a little bit of news but
uh apparently the
the uh the scoop is that Trump will be
returning with some kind of a platform
some kind of a social media or maybe
it's a news platform we don't know what
kind of platform it is but he's going to
be coming at us with a platform
if I were him this is how I would have
done it
I would have tried to get investors to
do a roll up which is combining let's
say
Rumble and parlor and some of the other
some of the other properties that try to
compete with the the major brands and
I'll make you an alternative internet
basically but we'll see what he does
here is the coolest thing
ever
all right I may I may have oversold this
a little bit back it up back it up it's
a cool thing
you heard about how scientists say that
if you consume too much news from One
Source either all on the left or all
leading right that it will cause brain
damage
brain damage
and they don't use that word lightly if
you only follow the left or you only
follow the right you actually get brain
damage now wouldn't you like to know
how much brain damage you're getting
because nobody's you know nobody is
perfect right nobody is perfectly
balanced
when you like to know
well it turns out that there's a brand
new tool that I just tweeted so you
could just go to my Twitter account it's
right at the top at the moment
and uh you've heard of ground news
ground news they they tell you how much
of uh uh they tell you which news sites
left or right are covering witch stories
so they'll often hilariously post
something that says uh everybody on the
left is talking about it and literally
no one on the right
or vice versa so that's very
Illuminating but they came out with a
new little tool new app in which you can
put in the name of any Twitter user
including yourself
and it will tell you based on your
Twitter activity and who you're
following and tweeting I guess uh how
biased
your followings are
so if you're interacting primarily with
the left or primarily with the right
science says
brain damage
brain damage
and so you can find out how much brain
damage you're giving yourself
with this app
is that about the coolest thing you've
ever heard in your life
so ground news congratulations I just so
I just ran my own uh through it and I
came out relatively balanced
I I definitely lean a little bit more
right the people I interact with more
likely to be on the right
but uh the bottom line for me is that I
follow enough news on the left and
enough people and I interact with them
enough that I am not
not giving myself brain damage
how about that yay for me
some of you may get a different result
it'll be even more interesting if you
put other people in there
so let's say somebody's arguing with you
on Twitter and they're just being a
stick them into the app
and find out if they have brain damage
do you see what do you see why I'm so
excited about this
yeah look in my uh somebody's asking for
the link so I just tweeted it just a
moment before I came on
so or you could go to just search for
ground news
ground like the ground you're standing
on and you can you can follow them and
you should or you can go to my Twitter
account and it's the one I just tweeted
this morning so you'll see it right at
the top
so you can actually have a Twitter
debate with somebody
and send to them the result of of how
brain damage they are
is there anything you've waited for that
would make you happier than this
seriously if it looks like I'm just like
dancing in my seat it's because nothing
could make me happier
than being able to prove to somebody I
mean I don't know how much science you
want to say this is but certainly it
would be entertaining
even if not a strictly scientific uh to
say you know according to this app
the the things you follow and the things
you interact with strongly suggest
according to science
and you do follow science right do you
love science do you do you love it
because I love it
if you love science here's the evidence
that you've got brain damage
all right
um of course there's yet another mass
shooting apparently there have been
seven mass shootings in the last seven
days
I'm seeing a pattern develop here
um now some of the mass shootings are
more like Inner City
situations where things got out of
control I think as opposed to the kind
where somebody gets a gun and plans it
and you know goes somewhere just as you
people
um
but seven of them in seven days
you know even if you're a Pro's Second
Amendment as I am a very Pro with Second
Amendment
you got to worry about seven shootings
in seven days seven mass shootings
um we learned today that the the Denver
shooting in which 10 people tragically
died including a police officer uh we're
told that the suspect is male
well I didn't see that coming
is anybody else as surprised as I am
that this Mass shooter was
male
what are the odds of that
um
but interestingly the ethnicity of the
shooter has not been released has it
yeah if I'm going to take a guess
probably a youngish white guy
I'm just gonna put it out there
because if you're young and white
there's a pretty good chance you're in
the same category with a lot of mass
Shooters now obviously there's a lot of
you know Urban shootings that are they
have a different character to them
they're more you know crime related or
gang-related or you know a party got out
of control but when somebody actually
plans it
the odds of them being a white male with
an AR-15
pretty pretty high pretty high
um
why is it the AR-15s are used in so many
of these mass shootings I just saw a
list this morning of how often they're
used
pretty often pretty often so why is it
that the AR-15 is the most used weapon
handguns being second
now
you say to yourself well the reason
that's being used is because it's the
best weapon that's easily available best
in terms of killing power
that's not exactly true
I I think most gun you know gun experts
or gun hobbyists will tell you
that if you went into exactly those same
situations with the right you know
automatic handguns
you would do the same amount of damage
right because if it's a crowded space
the handgun is going to do just as much
damage so you're not really getting that
much extra killing power
from the AR-15 and by the way if there's
some gun I know there's lots of gun
enthusiasts watching this so check my
math on that right now here's the first
thing we learned
none of those mass shootings involved a
fully automatic weapon
none of them involved
a a fully automatic weapon why is that
yeah I meant semi-automatic sorry gun
people are correcting me as we go so I I
often use the wrong gun terms because
guns are not exactly my hobby
I'm pro-second Amendment but you know
how to make a hobby of it
so
yeah why is it the fully automatics were
not used
because they're illegal well not illegal
you can own a fully automatic but it's
harder it's just more difficult yeah so
doesn't this give you a lot of evidence
you know short of a scientific proof but
doesn't this strongly suggest
that banning fully automatic weapons
may have worked
in the sense that nobody used an
automatic weapon
like I said earlier maybe the total
number of people killed ends up being
about the same because a person with the
handguns
in a public place is going to do just as
much damage no matter what kind of
weapon you have you know maybe there's a
little faster firing with the because my
understanding is that even if you had an
automatic weapon unless you were
shooting into a crowd at close range
you'd still rather take a shot at a time
gun people confirmed this for me
that if you're if your goal was to kill
a bunch of people and unless they were
clustered all together you know as long
as there's a little separation your your
best technique
for getting the most people dead would
be one shot at a time
can any can anybody uh
can anybody confirm that now somebody's
saying there are fewer rounds than a
handgun but of course you would bring
extra rounds with you you know you'd be
slapping a clip in there I guess uh
pretty quickly
but the the gun experts have schooled me
you know people with actual military
experience Etc and saying that a shot at
a time you know well aimed is going to
get you more kills than
and one of the reasons is that automatic
weapons will ride up have you heard of
this
if you're here let me do the example for
you using my back scratcher
so
apparently if you're if you have an
automatic weapon and you put it on
automatic and start shooting it will go
like this and your gun will rise
so you actually end up being very
inaccurate if you keep it on the fully
automatic mode
so the point being that a non
-non-fully automatic and even
non-semi-automatic you know a revolver
is going to kill a lot of people even if
it doesn't shoot as quickly and doesn't
carry as many rounds so there's your uh
Mass issued or education for today
how long will it be before we find out
the ethnicity of the Killer
and why would they keep that from us
um
makes you curious doesn't it makes you
curious
all right
um how about some good news
in Appalachia the place in the United
States most famous for poverty
they've somebody built a greenhouse that
is a size of 58 football fields
what
it's an indoor Greenhouse for growing
all kinds of stuff and it's a size of 58
football fields
uh one of the largest in the world now
here's the here are the benefits of
growing indoors
saves on water
like a lot right and agricultural use of
water one of the biggest problems in the
world
so that's good number two saves on
shipping
because in theory you could locate your
indoor
um indoor growing
closer to the market so you don't have
to ship it from another country Etc
um
so you save on water you save on
shipping I'm assuming you save on
pesticides because it's a controlled
environment so in theory you wouldn't
need any right so they would be I don't
know if this is true I'd have to get a
an opinion on this but that might make
them organic
just because you don't have to control
for pests
I think that might be true although you
would still fertilize them so maybe
that's not organic
um and then the third thing is that our
food supply would be safer from climate
change
so if if you believe that climate change
is going to make it worse for growing
in some way because it disrupts the
weather pattern now I know you're
already typing Scott don't you know that
more CO2 is good for plant life and
there is more vegetation in the world
now than there has been in years because
of that all that CO2
so climate change is really good for
crops Scott don't you know that Scott
Scott
well I do know that but if climate
change I'll put an if there because I
know some of you are Skeptics but if
climate change causes massive weather
disruptions
those disruptions and floods and
whatever
could be a larger impact than the CO2 so
there is some risk we just don't know
which which way that goes could end up
that climate change could end up be the
greatest thing that ever happened to
Farms
but it could also make farms in some
places
non-viable while making firms in other
places the best year they've ever had
so it's nice to have some Greenhouse
options here
to me this is one of the best stories
ever it just doesn't seem interesting
right but the fact that you can make
greenhouses this big and apparently they
figured out how to make it profitable
it's a big deal I think if I were to
design a city and I do plan to do this
before I die sometime I would put a
massive Greenhouse right there
so I would make sure that you paired
maybe a nuclear power facility possibly
a Gen 4 you know smaller safer kind of
thing then I would put a massive indoor
Farm
and then I would make sure that you know
your water situation was taken care of
you were close enough to a major airport
boom perfect City
more to that later
there's a statistic that says 42 percent
of Americans
report undesired weight gain during the
pandemic
and the average weight gain is 29 pounds
and 41 pounds for millennials
do you believe any of that
are aren't we at a point where uh you
just don't believe any statistics
all right no seriously do you believe
that the Millennials were gaining 41
pounds on average
41 pounds
I don't believe that anyone gained 41
pounds this year I don't even know if
you could gain 41 pounds in a year could
you if you if you tried really hard
could you gain 41 pounds I mean you'd
have to start at 300.
to gain that yeah so the first thing you
need to know is that this is very
unlikely to be true that's very unlikely
and secondly
how how many people uh got healthier
in the comments all right are you ready
in the comments uh you're already
starting it but I want the rest of you
to do it tell me your weight uh gain or
loss all right
so tell me your weight gain or loss I
want everybody to present participate
either the same you know plus 10 minus
10 give me give me your number
um I'll tell you mine I think um plus
five
but intentionally
so I I intentionally gained five pounds
for cosmetic reasons Christina likes me
you know five pounds heavier I like
myself five pounds lighter because when
I look in the mirror my stomach is you
know Tighter and I can see my abs
Christina likes me a little beefier
because my face my face looks a little
more filled out I look younger that way
so I gained five but it was under
control
all right I'm looking at I'm going to
read off your numbers negative 10
negative 20 plus 20 plus 10
wow minus 4 plus 40. geez sorry about
that
uh plus seven plus fifteen these will
all be pluses 12 even same 20 pounds
lost congratulations minus 18. good work
uh lost 18 and again good work plus ten
minus seven good work
um I feel as if this pandemic really
really told you who you were
didn't it
about five minus one
plus ten plus four
minus five plus ten plus two plus five
whoa hold on hold on did I really see
that
uh jungle well I'm not going to read
your name because it's offensive but did
you really lose 64 pounds this year
could be
um
lost 10 lost 10. all right
somebody lost for somebody says they
lost 41 I don't know about that minus 25
good job loss 15. good job all right
here's here's a uh what I think happened
here
when you have something like a pandemic
and suddenly you don't know what to do
because you haven't been in a pandemic
before and you have to make your own
decisions
most of the time you put into a
situation where the decisions are kind
of made for you
right you kind of know you got to get a
job and you have to wear clothes and you
know if you want to go somewhere there's
a certain way to do it Etc but you hit
the pandemic and suddenly all the rules
are wrong and nothing's the same and now
you have to now you have to figure out
what to do
I think this really told you who you
were
there are people who who see crises
and say oh wow this crisis is going to
give me an opportunity to do something I
never could have done without the crisis
and one of the things that I wanted to
do was
take a year to work on my fitness more
than normal
and so I did that and so by you know at
least my muscle definition is probably
better than ever
and
I said to myself I'm not going to waste
this crisis
I started a new line of business
I got healthier
got a lot of stuff in order and so I
came out ahead
and I knew I would because it was my
plan and there was nothing to stop it
there was no friction I had every
opportunity in the world to come out
ahead I had more time to work on stuff
so I could do things that I've been
putting off and I you know could work on
my fitness because I don't have a social
life
like mostly
so and I try to on day one I tried to I
tried to uh you know get you a little
bit pregnant with that philosophy that
you should be looking at this as an
opportunity not just a problem it's a
big problem
but it comes with an opportunity
now
um
here's the payoff for this topic
number one ask yourself look at the
people who lost weight
if you look at all the people in the
comments who said they lost weight I
don't think it was a majority maybe 25
percent of you perhaps said you lost
weight
that could have been you
that could have been you right because
nothing stops you from taking a walk
and nothing stops you from eating more
healthily if you need if you need some
help in losing weight
see my book behind me I haven't failed
almost everything and still win big
two of the chapters in there are about
Fitness and diet systems
now when I talk about a system it's as
opposed to having a goal of losing
weight if you have a goal usually you're
just going to work harder I'm going to
try harder to not eat and then that's
just something that most people can't do
but if you have a system
that makes it easy to lose weight or
easy to exercise well then most people
can succeed because you took something
hard and you just made it easy let me
give you an example
I remove from my home
food that's bad for me
that's the system
how hard is it for me to simply not buy
food this bad for me it's not hard
because as long as I'm not hungry when
I'm shopping which is also a system
right make sure you're not hungry when
you're shopping I just don't have
anything in the house that's bad for me
so when I'm hungry
I eat what's in the house because it's
easy so I've created a system in which
eating bad food is sort of Impractical
because I made it that way
now there's a whole bunch of other you
know system tweaks such as a system of
continuously learning how to prepare a
food that's good for you in a way that
you enjoy eating
so I never stop experimenting on how to
make a a yam taste good
and by the way I have a really good way
to eat a yam that makes it taste great
soy sauce and pepper it's good stuff but
if you're not experimenting continuously
how to make the the food that's good for
you tastes good also
the difference between how good your bad
food tastes and how good the stuff
that's good for you taste is going to be
gigantic but you can learn to close that
Gap
by learning to prepare it just the way
you like and figuring out what works and
what doesn't anyway that's the short
version if you want to see the longer
version It's in my book people who have
read that book report losing massive
amounts of weight gaining muscle and
none of it and none of the book is about
really weight or Diet
it's only about systems so you would
design your own systems I give you some
examples but it's about you know coming
up with a system that's designed for you
not one that I give you
but here's the the payoff for this uh
this uh statistic about 42
percent of Americans report undesired
weight gain and this comes from day
silver who you should be following on
Twitter nay silver even if you disagree
with him on everything
he can do math he can do math
better than you can probably at least
statistics anyway
so here's what he says this really calls
out for a control
meaning a controlled part of the
experiment how many Americans have
undesired weight gain in a typical year
did any of you think of that question
if this year 42 percent of Americans
gained weight they didn't want
what's a normal year look like
I'll bet it's pretty close to 42 percent
of Americans gain weight they didn't
want all right
it's probably exactly the same
but you don't know that
because they don't tell you that and it
takes it takes somebody who lives and
breathes statistics to flag this
obviously missing part of the analysis
which could be that there's nothing to
see here this might be just like every
other year in fact
the thing that can't be ruled out is
that people gained less weight
this year than before I don't think
that's true by the way but you can't
rule It Down based on what we know
so that's why native silver is a sort of
a National Treasure because Americans
are statistically ignorant and that
would I would include myself in this
category you know my my skill stack
has some statistics in it but not enough
that I would consider myself
capable to be a good analyst in that in
that area
so
um Sydney Powell you you all know Cindy
Powell she made lots of claims about
Dominion software and Dominion software
is suing her for
saying these things they say are untrue
guess what her defense is
you don't have to guess I'm just going
to tell you her defense is she's arguing
in new court filings that no reasonable
people would believe what she said
that's right her defense is that no
reasonable person would have believed
anything she said
about Dominion
what do you think of that
legally speaking is that a good defense
so when she was saying things such as
the the Dominion software had some
Venezuelan dictator connection
um and that it was you know her claim is
that it was rigged Etc
did you
as a reasonable person
as a reasonable person did you say to
yourself
um well I I don't think I could believe
that just because she's saying it
now there's a little bit more to the
argument which is that a reasonable
person should know
that just because Sydney Powell says
something is true
that you would still need to check
you know legally you'd have to do audits
or whatever you would still have to
check to know if it were true
so the point is
even if you agreed with her
like your your instinct Etc was the same
as hers so even if you did believe there
was some gigantic irregularity here
you would also be smart enough to know
that you wouldn't take it based on just
Sydney Powell said so
right
no matter how much you think she's right
isn't it also true
that you as a reasonable person would
still say but you still have to check
I mean it's not just because a lawyer is
pretty sure it happened because she
didn't say here's my source code look
you can see it yourself
she did not say here's the proof
you can see it yourself although she did
I guess she showed some evidence but I
think it should have been the obvious
to anybody who is a reasonable person
how do you define a reasonable person in
2021 when literally nobody is a
reasonable person it's just not even a
thing but here's the thing
I consider myself
a reasonable person
the evidence is in the ground news app
which suggests that I follow enough news
on the left and the right
to be relatively non-brain damaged
that's right so now I have an app which
has looked at my body of tweeting and
commentary and decided that unlike many
of you
I don't have brain damage from politics
now what if you did you ran your thing
you ran your uh let's say your Twitter
account
through the ground news app and it came
out showing that you're only following
news on the right
well that would say that you have brain
damage
scientifically speaking
or the same as if you were only
following news on the left it doesn't
matter if it's left or right if you're
only following one side
science says you've got brain damage and
you're giving it to yourself
now would you say that a person who has
brain damage
would be a reasonable person
no that's the opposite right a
reasonable person
by definition wouldn't you say is
somebody without brain damage
right
that would be pretty much understood to
be in the definition
so I'm a reasonable person I can
demonstrate with this app that I don't
seem to have an indication of brain
damage and when Sydney Powell was making
her claims about Dominion do you know
what I said
out loud
many times in public
well there's no way that's true
that's what I said
and I'm a reasonable person and I can
prove it with this ground News app
so how good is their defense
I'm a reasonable person and to me
her defense is 100 solid
because there was no way
that me you know I as a reasonable
person believed any of her claims
I did believe
it was worth looking into
I did believe that if you looked into it
you might be able to determine if she
her her Instinct was correct or if her
Instinct was off
right
you'd be able to be able to figure that
out
I think she has an airtight defense I
honestly do
because I would defend it just the way I
said
show me some reasonable people who
according to the app ground news do not
have brain damage I'll show you a few uh
here's one his name is Scott Adams
check for yourself
look at his body of work
check his ground news app and find out
if he has brain damage all right there's
a reasonable person Scott you're
reasonable did you believe everything I
said or did you think like a reasonable
person would that you would have to
validate it by you know really looking
into it
I think she wins
I think she does now
correct me if I'm wrong you know when I
get into the legal stuff I'm way over my
head
but I think this type of case
um it's not a reasonable doubt case
right it's one of those civil things
where uh the the jury just has to be
weighted in One Direction they don't
have to have 100 agreement
so she does have some risk but her
defense is solid I would say
um
so
I guess there's a there's a lot of
movement and I guess King County
a county that includes Seattle
Washington will spend 5 million of their
coven relief
uh that they're getting from the
government
um to fight what they call anti-asian
bias
in response to recent shootings in
Atlanta Georgia et cetera now
I think that anything that reduces bias
is good and anything that reduces
violence is good and anything that
reduces anti-asian violence is good
uh but I didn't even need to throw in
the anti-asian part right because
anything that reduces violence is good
but here's the question
how do you do that
what would be the way
to reduce anti-asian bias
because what's it based on
if you knew what the Asian the
anti-asian bias was based on
then you could work on you know work on
the the base assumptions to make sure
people are on the same page
but
I have a I have a let's say a hypothesis
that the anti-asian bias has to do with
their success
maybe not a hundred percent
but don't you think the biggest part of
why Asians are being targeted has more
to do with the fact that they're doing
great
like in American society they're doing
better than almost any other group
and
do you really think
that that a chinese-american citizen is
being targeted because the Chinese
Communist Party
which is you know X number of people
it's not China and it's certainly not
all Chinese people
is there is there anybody who is
targeting Asian Americans
because of what the Chinese Communist
party is doing
like we're being told that that's a
thing
but is it
and and did the violence suddenly Spike
or are we just more aware of it
you know there's it only takes a few
high profile incidents and if you look
at the Atlanta one that looked like a
coincidence the fact that the people who
were killed were mostly Asian was
because it was a massage parlor it was
the massage parlor that was the problem
according to the shooter it wasn't the
ethnicity at all
so first of all
um I would you know I assume anti-asian
bias and violence are real things of
course and that is there should be
lessened
but I don't know if you can do it if the
real problem is that Asian Americans are
too successful
because I feel like that's the problem
let me ask you who is the most hated
group in America
right now
who is the most hated group
I would say white rich people
you know the elites the people in power
they're the most probably the the most
hated why is it
that the most hated people are Elite
rich white people
isn't it because they're successful
you know it's also because the people in
who are in charge
or the people you think are in charge
create all the rules and if the rules
seem bad then you know who you're going
to blame but don't you have a problem
that the people who are the most
successful
are always hated
is there any exception to that can you
think of any exception where the people
who have the power
don't also have you know a third of the
public or more just hating them it's
sort of automatic isn't it so I have a
real question of whether anti-asian bias
can be addressed in like a substantial
way as long as they continue to be
successful
it feels like that's the problem
um so I did a little uh very
unscientific poll on Twitter they're all
unscientific but this is the most
unscientific of them all
the least credible poll ever taken I
asked this question in your opinion
which ethnic slash racial bias is the
biggest problem in the United States in
2021 all right so forget about the past
we're just talking about 2021 which
ethnic racial group
um is subject to the most
bias
now my audience uh is probably 87
percent White
and uh surprisingly
or not the results were the 87 percent
of the respondents said that white
people are subject to the biggest uh
ethnic bias
surprise
if 87 of my audience had been Asian
Americans
I think 87 would have said Asian
Americans are the biggest you know the
biggest uh bias victims likewise black
likewise Hispanic but just for fun uh
knowing that my audience is
overwhelmingly uh White
and mail
all right so it says non-scientific
group as you could ever come up with
uh but they say
that group says that the biggest bias is
against white people by 87 say that
seven percent say the biggest problem is
with uh Black Americans five percent say
Asian Americans or Asians I guess
because not all are citizens and two
percent said Hispanic
now to me that's the most interesting
one isn't it
how could it be that we have hordes of
migrants trying to come across the
border one of the biggest political
questions is the number of Hispanic
migrants coming into the country it's
you know one of the main things we talk
about
and yet
my audience again deeply unscientific
poll my audience says that only two
percent think that Hispanics are
suffering the biggest ethnic and racial
bias
why is that
I have a I have a hypothesis
they don't complain as much
isn't that the whole story
Hispanics just don't complain as much
especially especially the immigrants
right
because if you willingly came here and
took a big risk to get here at the very
least cognitive dissonance would make
you think you were in the country you
wanted to be in
so number one
um one of my biggest problems with
trying to be tough on border security
because I think rationally you have to
have a good border security I just think
you have to now how about you open it is
a separate question but you have to
control it first that's my view
and anybody who's willing to take the
risks and you know they're ambitious
enough and they want to live in this
country with me
hard to not like them it really is if
somebody says just walks up to you and
say you know I really like you I really
like you in fact I'd like to spend more
time around you and people like you
that's how much I like you and people
like you
how do you dislike that person
and and to a large extent that's what
immigrants tell us without saying it
they're saying they're they're voting
with their feet and their lives they're
risking their lives
risking their lives
to be more like me
and to be closer to me right that's not
the the purpose of course but it works
out that way and so from an economic
perspective and safety and all that you
have to control immigration
but I can't feel bad about it right I
can't I can't feel bad about the
Hispanics wanting to be part of what I'm
part of
so I think that makes and
the that population seems mostly
interested in work
right they're less interested in
complaining and they're more interested
in work and I know
I I can't feel bad about that
um
so there we go I think everybody thinks
that their group is the one that has the
most bias so that just makes sense
all right um
so Biden's coming up with this new three
trillion dollar infrastructure proposal
on top of all the trillions we spent
already
and
here's the thing
do we understand anything about national
debt I don't like anything
you know uh I've I've been on the side
who said that during the pandemic you
should just pick the biggest number and
just get that money out there because
the risk of the whole system falling
over is much bigger than the risk of oh
we added we added you know 20 to the
debt or whatever we could add and so it
made sense during the pandemic but once
you get to spending outside the focus of
the pandemic to just stuff we need
infrastructure or clean energy Etc
um
shouldn't there be some kind of limit on
that
 shouldn't there be some kind of
limit
on how much we spend or at the very
least
shouldn't our leadership say look here's
the deal
we're going to spend trillions of
dollars on stuff that we think we need
and they'll be good Investments Etc
but here's how we're going to pay back
the debt
I feel as if they need to tell us that
that they can or or how much risk there
is or whatever because I'm not saying
that we shouldn't spend this money
I'm just saying it's an incomplete plans
it's a half a plant
a half plan says we're going to spend
this much money the other part of the
plan is
and we're going to pay it back
and if we didn't pay it back
what does that do what happens to
inflation what happens to taxes so I
believe that we will be presented the
country will with this ginormous three
trillion dollar jobs and infrastructure
proposal and that
our our news industry will not insist
for a complete picture a complete
picture that explains how much debt can
the United States take on how are we
going to be going to pay it back now
again during a pandemic you don't have
the luxury of asking those questions but
we certainly have the luxury now I mean
it's the end of the pandemic ish but we
should be asking that but that won't
happen and that is a gigantic failure of
the press and you can predict it you
don't even have to wonder if that'll
happen there's no way in hell we will
ever get any good information on this
question of do we even need to pay back
this debt because national debt is
different than personal debt you can
keep national debt forever
personal debt you kind of have to pay
off or you're in trouble
all right uh
I was asked on Twitter what I thought
about this effort to study the origins
of the virus apparently there's some
science that you can apply to if you
have if you have enough samples from the
right places you can apply your science
and maybe you could find out the origin
of the virus
to which I say that sounds like a
complete waste of time
here's why
what is the most predictable thing you
could that you could say if if there's a
team of scientists studying the origin
of the virus
the most predictable outcome
I would say 100 certainty
is that if they were to come up with a
decision and say okay it started in
Wuhan or started somewhere else no
matter what they said
and no matter how much they showed you
their data and how they got there
there would be other scientists who say
they studied it wrong
100 chance
so what would you do as a citizen or as
a leader if you knew that one group of
scientists and yeah we studied it and it
came from you know a banana in
Switzerland
and another group of scientists said we
just looked at your data and it doesn't
look right here's why
now it's your job to follow the science
what do you do
what do you do
do you look at the work and say all
right let me dig into this a little bit
let me look into the work of how these
scientists came up with this estim this
idea of where it came from I'll look at
their statistics that I don't understand
I'll look at the genetics that I don't
understand and then what
am I going to decide who's right
no this is the problem
with the dumbest thing anybody's ever
said which is trust science
trust science is one of the dumbest
pieces of advice after be yourself
maybe the worst advice in the world is
be yourself
you should try to be better than
yourself
you should try to raise your games being
yourself is the worst device
uh
but follow the science doesn't work
because we don't know what the science
is
we don't see it
it would be like you could replace you
could replace the sentence follow the
science with
follow the magic leprechauns
whatever the magic leprechaun tells you
to say do that
now that wouldn't be easy would it
because you don't know where to find a
magic leprechaun
and if he did you wouldn't believe him
because it's a magic leprechaun not very
credible
so
you could tell us to follow the science
all day long but we can't
that's not a thing
all we can do is hear what people say
noise is not science
what you hear when the experts are
talking the scientist is noise
is not science
then your brain does this thing where
the noise is translated into thoughts
the thoughts are formed into opinions
and then you say to yourself oh yeah
I guess I just heard some science
I guess I'll follow the science
you never came close to science
what happened to you was there some
noise some vibration of air
entered your ear and then your brain did
something with it you are so far from
science
you're not it's like science is in a
sealed lead container on the other side
of the universe
it might be in there
but you can't get to it
and you can't see it
and nobody can tell you what's in there
who is Credible that's
now science of course is the you know
it's better than anything else we have
but the the whole of fetish of trusting
science is for stupid people
if I can say it you know as as plainly
as that
follow the science is for stupid people
just like be yourself
it's advice for stupid people it's just
the worst advice
all right
um
there was a nursing home in New York
state that burned up and some people
were trapped inside I didn't see the the
injury and death count
well let me tell you if there's one
place you don't want to be on this whole
earth
it would be a nursing home in New York
because nothing good happens in those
places apparently
um Rasmussen the polling people say that
58 percent
say that masks should be required until
everyone is vaccinated
58 percent
so a nice fairly solid majority
say wear masks until everyone is
vaccinated what do you think of that
um of course it breaks down by political
lines 76 percent of Democrats say you
should wear your masks until everybody's
vaccinated but nearly half of uh
Republicans 46 percent
so nearly half are Republicans say the
same thing
um I know my audience is more anti-mask
but
here's my take on this
as much as I think masks were a good
risk management decisions
we now have enough data to see that it
doesn't seem to move the Curve
and if it doesn't move the curve it
doesn't mean they don't work
it just means that maybe you can't see
the effect because the other variables
are just bigger
um
and I think at some point
the the death rate is low enough that
even if masks work
you shouldn't wear it
because it does lower your quality of
life quite a bit so I think I think you
should drop the masks
before before it's safe
you know what I mean
so even if Mass kelp you should probably
drop them sooner than later just because
uh it's not that big enough of an effect
and the citizens want some freedoms
we'd like some freedom
all right uh
Oakland is going to do a big Ubi test
the universal basic income so basically
some group of people in Oakland not all
of them but some group will be selected
to get free money
and then they can do whatever they want
they just get free money
what do you think of that
well I love an experiment
I think I've told you this before so I
am 100 in favor of this experiment it's
Oakland's money they want to spend it on
this okay
um
but uh I've often said that the
difference between the Democrats and
Republicans is that Republicans
consistently understand human motivation
whereas Democrats consistently act like
it's not even a thing
that if you that if you uh reward people
for stuff they won't do more of it
weird or that if you penalize somebody
for something they won't do less of it
whereas whereas Republicans think no if
you reward people they'll do more of it
if you punish them they'll do less of it
it's never different
friction works every time not 100 but it
works at least a little every time
so
testing this Ubi makes sense but what
would you expect to come out of the test
here's what I expect
um people who are
intrinsically motivated
will very quickly not need it because
they'll they'll go get their own work
etc and people who are not intrinsically
motivated will just spend the money and
it won't make any difference
and I feel as though
that the real the real way we should be
thinking of this
is that modern society has evolved to
the point where it's so complicated and
hard just to live and navigate our
complicated world
that a huge percentage of the population
will never be able to work
never be able to thrive
in Civilization as it has evolved
so there's going to be some percentage
maybe 20 percent who are going to do
great
because they can handle complexity they
can find all the advantages and you know
strategic things and put it together and
if you're unusually smart and capable
and ambitious this is a really good time
to be alive
but if you happen to be just a person
who wants to
kind of get by in life you are in the
wrong civilization
because you have to work
to get by and if that you're just not a
worker it's going to be tough
so I would expect that the universal
basic income would keep people who are
not ambitious
they would continue to not be that way
whereas they might have been forced to
do something productive otherwise
um but here's a so I'm going to say two
things about this one is that we need a
second path for human beings One path is
the common one that we see now which is
if you if you go to school and you're
smart enough and you're not addicted to
too many things you can probably make a
nice life for yourself
um
but I feel as if we need to create a
path
for people who will never be competitive
or successful
in uh in such a
you know complicated civilization that's
going to be a lot of people you know it
could be a third of the public just
won't be able to work or succeed when
drugs are freely available and uh you
know Temptations are all over the place
so I think we need this second path uh
which would require a lower cost of
living maybe you're building new
communities from Green Fields but
basically a tribal
living situation where everybody can do
a little bit
to contribute you know they they can
chip in a little bit but they don't have
to be a real go-getter and they don't
have to be able to thrive in the
complicated world as long as they can do
well and help out in a sort of a tribal
more
Cooperative environments
so when you hear stuff like that you say
to yourself my God Scott that's
communism and keep that away from me to
which I say maybe people are different
personally I would not want to be
anywhere near communism
because I feel I can Thrive better if I
compete and you know I feel I have some
competitive advantages so I'd be better
just competing but there are a lot of
people who can't compete and we just
have to face that because it's just real
a lot of people just can't compete in
the modern world they need a path where
they can have a reasonable life it just
costs less so they don't have as many
maybe they don't have cars
because you build a community where you
just don't need one so they don't have
to pay for the car
all right so anyway lowering living
stand living the cost of living
for the second path is just it has to
happen it has to happen
um and then the other thing if you want
to get really controversial
shouldn't we only be comparing
ethnicities
by happiness
suppose
you were to do a poll and you found out
that black Americans were just as happy
as Ian Americans or anybody else white
Americans
do you need to fix that
so let's say one group has more money
and more advantages and and that that
difference is real and it's caused by
bias
it's caused by racism
let's say that's real
but what if both sides are just as happy
isn't happiness the point
why would you why would if you had two
groups that are happy and let's say one
person has a million dollars and the
other person has a hundred thousand
dollars
the very artificial example but they're
just as happy
what would be the argument for taking
the money from the Richer the rich
person and giving some amount of it to
the less rich person
what would be the argument for that
like why does that need to be balanced
when the point of life is happiness
and they're both just as happy
so
I would say that looking at economics
and trying to balance it we're just
looking at the wrong things
I do like you know economic equality I'm
all for it but I'm not sure that's the
point of life
um Elon Musk said something uh
provocative uh he he tweeted a little
meme that said the strongest argument
for uh
well what he tweeted was he said the
strongest argument against aliens
meaning against the idea that aliens are
visiting in their spaceships and he
showed two graphs one showed the camera
resolution
improves you know has been improving
like greatly in recent years especially
recently
but the photographs of UFOs are still uh
low definition
which is kind of funny it how much
further into the future can we go
where every photograph is really really
clear you know and everybody's got a
camera
at the same time that every photograph
of an alien spaceship is a grainy smudge
you know at the moment
you can say to yourself okay it's
because the spaceship is moving fast and
it's yeah maybe it's up in the clouds
and maybe it's got some alien technology
that keeps it from being photographed or
something I don't know uh
but the longer you go
the more it becomes a little obvious
that somebody would have gotten at least
one good picture at least one
so that was Elon musk's provocative
tweet today or yesterday
um
the AstraZeneca vaccine everybody's
talking about the company itself says
they did some more studies and found out
it was 79 overall efficacy
and 100 percent uh success in keeping
people from severe hospitalization
a hundred percent
do you believe that do you believe that
there's a vaccination that is a hundred
percent effective at preventing
hospitalizations and severe disease
no no
you should not believe that
you know it could be close to 100 which
would be cool
um but of course I tweeted this because
it looked like good news it took me 10
seconds for somebody else to say but
what about all these other stories
um for example The Wall Street Journal
is reporting that U.S officials said
they were told to AstraZeneca may have
released outdated informations what in
its disclosure of trial results what
um and they may have provided an
incomplete view of the efficacy data
what
now do you see the problem with
following the science
which science
you've got two Sciences here one science
says yeah this this stuff's good and it
works and the other science says we
don't know if it works
and then there's yet other sciences that
says that cause blood blood clots
but then there's yet other science that
says it doesn't
so trust the science it's on both sides
it works and it doesn't work according
to science
so
uh I don't have an opinion whether this
is you know a good vaccine or not
but I'd probably take it I'd probably
take it
um breaking news the senior citizens are
dying and they're dying within days
of doing uh turns out anything anything
so senior citizens are dropping Dead all
over the world
within just a few days
of having done
well anything
watching TV
eating an apple
getting a vaccination
yeah pretty much senior citizens are
dying after
everything
and so
um the EU is considering a ban on all
human activity
because if people are dying within days
after every human activity
I don't think we can continue having
human activities
people are dying within days all over
the world and it's not stopping
do you know why that there are senior
citizens dying
um after human activities
there is a Cause
it turns out and this is science too I
looked into this did some research it
turns out that the number of people who
die
after they've already died
zero
or at least I couldn't find any I mean
maybe a zombie here or there but it
turns out that only people who are
already alive
are dying at all
people who are already dead
the death rate for them the additional
death rate of you know being dead and
then being more dead zero
so exactly zero dead people have died
after getting this vaccination
it's good to know
but a lot of uh people who are alive
have died after literally everything
riding a bike
taking a shower
died within two weeks tragic
um
all right so that
is my show for today
since Ainsley says careful you're
prescribing genocide
cure death
that explains why Biden isn't doing
anything
oh yeah so there's a story that says
Biden and Harris are traveling together
um
here's what I think is happening now the
thinking is that the the reason for that
is that she's you know learning on the
job and she's going to take over any
minute I think that that is part of it I
do think that they're giving her more
more presidential exposure because they
think she'll she's likely to take over
before his term is over I feel like
everybody believes that right but I
think there might be a second
explanation and I'm going to use the
science of body language
for this hypothesis and by and when I
say the science of body language I mean
a lot of it's guessing
but if you saw there's a video I was
watching this morning of Biden and
Harris they were traveling together and
they got off or they were getting on or
off for a helicopter or something and
they were chatting with some other
official looking people
and on a number of occasions you saw
Kamala Harris put her hands on Biden
have you seen that video so she'll just
sort of you know she'll be talking and
then she'll Pat him on the shoulder or
she'll just you know lightly touch his
back while she's talking to him
watch How often she touches him
what's that mean
well if it were the other way around it
would be sexually inappropriate but when
a woman when a woman in a business
setting touches a man
that's fine because well the man doesn't
care so it actually is fine and but
watch how often she touches them
here's what I think is going on just a
hypothesis
I believe that uh Joe's mental state is
deteriorating
and I believe that he needs people that
he has a certain level of trust in
to keep him on the right track
and I believe that Kamala Harris's real
job is a little bit like a nurse
and I mean that literally meaning that I
believe she's there
to tell him things that other people
can't tell him
because he's not quite he's not quite
mentally capable so I think a lot of
people are saying Kamala could you tell
him he needs to do this and then maybe
she's the only one he trusts
because he's got a he's got a history
with her and she had a relationship with
you know bow Etc so yeah I I'm not sure
a Handler is exactly the right word
although there might be a little that I
believe that she's there as a emotional
mental
uh let's say support
and I believe she's there to like maybe
step in if things
look a little weird
that's my guess
um
yeah and his wife
serves a similar role I would say that
yes
um somebody's saying he she prompts him
and helps him finish sentences baby I
haven't seen that but it wouldn't
surprise me
and then I guess there's a story of
Kamala Harris was asked about the crisis
on the border and she and she was she
going to go there and she laughed and
said not today and people said uh it's
not funny
why are you laughing
but of course the laugh was about not
today it wasn't about the situation Etc
but it turns into a news story that
makes her look bad
um
so uh yeah Kamala Harris does have a
problem that she can't stop laughing
when she's talking about a tragedy I
don't feel bad about that because I've
got the same problems sometimes I laugh
at tragedies
I know I should but I do
um
oh do we know the name of the shooter
I'm not going to say that name out loud
but somebody in the comments says that
we know the name of the shooter
but I don't want to say the name because
that would be
uh let's just say there would be some
racial bias if you heard the name at
least the one that was in the comments I
don't know if that's the real name
all right that's all I got and I will
talk to you tomorrow
well if I can turn this off I will
all right YouTubers
um
I'm just looking at your comments so it
does look like there's some news about
the shooter that we're hearing I guess
there's a name out there now
uh do we suffer brain damage getting our
news from you no your brain is healthier
because you got your news for me because
I'm not partisans
it might seem like it but I'm not
um bitcloud
I haven't checked my
my value on bitcloud
I need to check that so yeah you can buy
an nft of of me I guess on something
called bitcloud
um
all right my coin is in the top tens
Christian says yeah I'll go check that
um
I have not read that book by Rodger
um
just I'm reading your comments if you're
listening to this on the podcast I'm
sorry that you can't see the comments
by the way do you know that if you have
a digital device the one made by Amazon
or the one that's built into your Apple
phone I don't want to say their names
because I don't want to activate your
device but you can say to them
device names which you know and then say
uh play coffee with Scott Adams
and my podcast will just pop right up
have I heard of decentral land no but I
like it just based on the name I think I
would like that
have we been hypnotized into watching
you every day yes you have
that's what the simultaneous sip does
uh
glad to hear you've come to your senses
on masks probably having no well you
were wrong you're wrong
so the the thing that I'll have to
explain for the rest of my life
is risk management
when the decision of hydroxychloroquine
came up early on I said the science does
not prove it works but as a risk
management decision
you might want to try it
because the you know the downside is low
and certainly try it in one state or one
country or something to see if it makes
a difference
um that doesn't mean that I am right or
wrong about whether that drug works
and at least 75 percent of the
population can't understand that point
when you make a risk management decision
the decision can be right
even when the outcome is wrong do you
get that
so as it is with masks since the science
was undependable
and we didn't know how it applied to
this new situation and we wouldn't know
we wouldn't know and we wouldn't trust
the data that said it worked or that it
didn't work because nothing is
Dependable data wise
but common sense says that if the amount
of the viral shedding matters right if
you get more viral exposure you get more
sick that the masks if they if they
reduce moisture coming out of your mouth
and they do and moisture is what carries
the virus and it does that it makes
sense that you'd spread less of it
but it is true
that we're not seeing it in the data
um I have not seen any data that would
suggest that mask squaring
by itself
makes any difference at all I still
think it probably does
but I I would admit that we don't see it
in the data
that does seem to be the fact now years
from now will we know for sure if masks
worked maybe you might find a way to
test it better or something
but I'm going to guess that it works a
little
it might not work enough that we would
be happy to use them in the next
pandemic I don't know
so don't uh so that for those of you who
are mistakenly imagining that my opinion
went from mask's work
to masks don't work or probably don't
work you're misinterpreting completely
your risk management decision might
change but in both cases you're not
saying definitely yes or definitely no
you're just saying I don't know it looks
like the odds are in favor of this
and I would say that even still I don't
mind putting on my mask because I think
they're you know there's a good chance
there's some little Improvement
I'll take the extra Edge
um
yeah they might help so why not yeah the
why not is whether or not uh it makes
you crazy
because it's definitely not free to wear
a mask it does make you a little crazy
the somebody says the risk level is how
much time you spend with a confined
person yeah I agree with that
um but also Common Sense tells me that
maybe without a mask you could be
totally infected in five minutes but
maybe with a mask
you wouldn't be totally infected for
seven minutes
right something like that so you might
not ever see that difference in the
statistics but there must be a lot of
interactions where the the length of the
interaction is changed by wearing the
mask you know whether you could get it
from that it seems logical
um our lockdowns poor risk management in
retrospect yes
when we're first doing the lock
lockdowns and we were talking about two
weeks that was a good decision
because maybe it would have worked you
know in retrospect it didn't work but it
could have like it wasn't it wasn't
unreasonable to close down for a few
weeks that was actually a good
leadership decision it didn't work
but that doesn't make it a bad decision
because it was a risk management
decision
um
somebody says anger is killing me
you know I felt a little that lately
uh keeping the mask on is unhealthy
we might know more about that in the
future
now I'm probably it's easier for me to
be Pro mask because I have that Elite
situation
where I don't really need to put on a
mask unless I leave the house and I
don't have to leave the house if I don't
want to and if I do leave the house and
I'm outdoors I don't wear a mask
so mess are not the biggest problem in
my life but imagine if I had a job where
I had to wear one for eight hours a day
I'd be pretty anti-masculine especially
if I were younger
uh the camera looks great somebody says
no it's the same same camera
um yeah it's a it's a luxury opinion I
tweeted around an article by Rob
Henderson's few years old talking about
how Elites such as myself
uh can have these luxury opinions where
I'll say an opinion that's bad for poor
white people but not me
because it'll make me sound good yeah
open those borders and let everybody
come in
because they're not going to be
competing for my job they're going to be
competing for somebody else's job so
isn't it great that I could have such a
a liberal open-minded opinion about
immigration because it's only bad for
you
it's not bad for me for me I just get
you know cheaper Gardener that's it
uh thoughts on crypto so I'm not a
crypto guy meaning that I'm involved
with crypto but I'm not any expert on it
and
and here's my take
if I were young or I had a big enough
portfolio where I could diversify I
would definitely own Bitcoin at this
point
so there was a time when you could say I
don't know if Bitcoin is going to stay
around but I think we're past that time
it does seem like it's going to be here
so any Young Person's portfolio should
have some Bitcoin every old person who
has a big enough portfolio should put a
little bit in there and
um
but any other any other kind of coin I
think has uh is riskier that's basically
the whole story
all right that's all for now I'll talk
to you
