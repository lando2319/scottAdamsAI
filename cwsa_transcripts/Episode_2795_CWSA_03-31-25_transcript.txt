uh don't check the stocks whatever you
do don't look at your
stocks it'll just make you
sad but it's probably temporary so I
wouldn't worry about it
yet all right let's call up your
comments and then we're going to get
busy I've got things to teach you
today there we go
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a cuper Mugger a
glass a tanker CH Ain a canteen Jugger
flask a Fel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dope me of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go do you feel better
now you
should well ladies and
gentlemen um let me tell you a little
thing about what's going on with me
right now I'm officially disabled I got
my wheelchair here and uh I can barely
walk so for the last three months I've
had this uh insane leg related
pain um so I'm in pretty bad
shape and uh if I scream during this uh
this
broadcast it won't be that unusual CU I
spent half the day screaming in pain
it's been about 3 months now and the
weirdest thing about it is that I've
predicted to my my audience on locals
the subscribers I told them that as soon
as my right leg which is where all the
pain was that as soon as it got better
the very moment it got better it would
just switch to my other
leg and it did that this
morning yesterday afternoon all after
like a week or 10 days of not being able
to walk in my right leg having to limp
or hop or use the
wheelchair I uh it just cured itself so
my right leg is perfectly functional but
the exact problem exact problem just
exact moved instantly to my left
leg and this is the fourth or fifth
time it's uh is jumped over to the other
leg so some say It's s itica I don't
know but I'm in bad shape so I thought I
would share that with you in case I
scream during the uh
broadcast because the odds of me
screaming and pain are actually pretty
high anyway uh let's see what's in the
news 12200 scientists say that they're
uh they're done with Trump's America
they're they they hate it they're going
to move to Europe or they're going to
move somewhere else and they they don't
like the federal fund cuts and the mass
firings and and now the uh they're going
to Europe where as you know uh they have
much more
freedom could you imagine going from
America to Europe because you're seeking
freedom I don't know um but I did a
little uh query on grock to find out is
1200 research scientists a lot turns out
there's close to 2 million of them in
the United
States 2 million research
scientists so 1200 would be
.006 of the 2 million do you suspect
that the finest research scientists are
the ones that are going to Europe I
don't do you suspect that the 1200 who
say they're going to Europe some say
they're going to Canada are really going
to do it
I doubt it because if the reason they
want to go somewhere is that they lost
funding is is an American Research
scientist going to get more funding in
Europe I mean maybe I don't know about
how that works but none of that seems
like a good
idea so maybe there's something wrong
with us research
scientists anyway the stock market's all
crazy and down because uh
questions about tariffs the reciprocal
tariffs go into effect on April 2nd so a
couple days and I am deeply curious how
that's all going to work out on one
level I completely understand that if we
don't completely or fairly
substantially rewrite the you know the
economic relationships between the
United States and the countries we trade
with that we don't have any chance of
getting of our economic ho meaning the
debt and we need to do it on the other
hand it's pretty much guaranteed to
cause
some some issues so the question will be
will there be enough positive news to to
insulate us from the negative news
because really the way we're going to
treat it is going to be almost entirely
based on the news coverage so if the
news cover cage says Hey surprisingly
it's all working out well things are
going to boom and that will be based on
anecdotes it won't base on some large
comprehensive review at least not in the
early days but if in the early days the
news says oh your eggs are more
expensive or your car parts or something
like that and you got a bunch of
interviews with people saying I couldn't
afford to buy the car that I wanted it's
going to be bad so I think it a mix of
those two things but I'm really
curious um and I also would say that I
don't see what else we could have
done you know the the people who think
they're smart but aren't like to say
stuff like well we should have targeted
tariffs perhaps in specific
cases but what's wrong with just saying
that our tariffs will be the same as
yours how could that be
wrong so I guess we'll be doing a lot of
negotiating with these other countries
really fast we'll see meanwhile RFK Jun
was on Chris guo show on news
nation and
uh the stories he tells about the
organization he's running now are are
just so
mindboggling apparently the entire place
was just a A Rat's
Nest so they had what 80,000 employees
and and all these different departments
and everything was just sort of uh
inefficient but here's here's the one
that just as crazy so RFK was talking
about it so they have this thing called
CMS data which is customer medical data
and it's important to a lot of the
different entities in that Health and
Human Services area because they got
lots of sub entities and apparently if
you were a sub entity and you wanted
that data you had to buy
it within the same
organization you're not buying it from
an outside
entity you had to buy it from
another from a peer group within the
same Health and Human
Services have you ever heard of anything
so dysfunctional as
that so when RFK Jr said uh so I tried
to get the CMS patient information which
belongs to to the American people and it
belongs to Health and Human Services and
the sub agency said we have to buy it
from
them it doesn't make any sense there are
sub agencies that refuse to give us
patient
data it's like you can't even imagine
how bad it was it's like Beyond bad so
he's going to cut 20,000 employees out
of 80,000 or so uh and he's going to
consolidate departments and so here
here's my real
question who was running this place
before who didn't want to bring up the
fact that there might be some
inefficiencies this is really damning to
everybody who is ever in charge of that
in Prior
years I mean are you kidding it was
absolutely broken from top to bottom and
and nobody mentioned
it it seems like that should have been
right at the top of things that the head
of the you know any new head of the
human health and human resources should
have mentioned but but it's got to be
RFK Jr he's the only one who could
mention that's completely
broken
anyway um Trump says he's uh very angry
and quote pissed off at Putin so it's
Putin piss off and uh I guess he's mad
at Putin for not you know not agreeing
to you know the peace deal that he
thought he had he thought he had the
temporary ceasefire thing where you know
at the very least they would do a
ceasefire in the uh the Black Sea but
apparently Putin sort of backed off that
a little bit and now Trump's threatening
to put uh secondary tariffs on him now
the smart people who are dumb
say Trump is so dumb we don't buy
anything from
we don't buy any energy from Putin so
how's the Tariff going to work now it's
a secondary tariff a secondary tariff
which means that if any other country
buys uh energy from Putin we tariff the
second country so basically we would be
punishing anybody you bought from Putin
I don't know if that's a good idea or a
bad idea but it's out there
now meanwhile Trump has uh uh
he's confirmed that he's going to do a
uh a dinner with h Bill Maher and he
says he's going to do it as a favorite
Kid Rock and he just slams Bill Mah in a
statement on Truth social uh basically
just says out what a bad character he is
uh but because Kid Rock thinks it's a
good idea he's going to do it so I was
waiting for Trump to explain his his
view on that and his view on is he
definitely wouldn't do it except for Kid
Rock is a personal friend so he's going
to do him a
favor and then he's going to invite Dana
White so Dana White will make up the
table
now what do you think is going to
happen I worry that we're not going to
really hear what happened you know like
maybe there'll be three different
versions that come out of it but do you
think anything useful will come out of
that
I don't think so because I think the
problem whatever it is between Trump and
Bill Mah is first of all
personal and then uh at least Bill Mah
treats it like it's political so if the
problem is personal because I think they
had a a gripe long before Trump ran for
president uh if it's
personal this is going to be quite the
it's G to be quite the dinner
how much would you pay to watch that
dinner uh if it were pay for
review I would
pay
$100 because you know there's nothing on
TV and the movies all suck so there's
almost nothing you can watch on the
screen except Social Media stuff so if I
could just you know have really good
microphones and you know cameras that
showed everybody's faces and that um
yeah that would pay more than the
average person because I'm more
interested I I think a a good market
rate for that would
be probably 20 to
$50
pay-per-view I would absolutely watch
that that conversation that's I think
it's going to be fascinating so I'm all
for it I know I'm not expecting it to
change the world but hey you never
know um
you heard this before the Gateway P's
writing about it today that uh you know
how you always watch the White House
Press briefings and you see all the same
uh left
leaning um journalists seem to be all in
the front and and you wonder why why do
they always get to be in the front like
who makes the rule I always thought it
was the White House I thought the White
House decided who was where and that
they just sort of put the ones who had a
lot of tenure in the front and so that
would be you know stuff like uh you know
the the basic uh networks and stuff but
it turns out that the seating was
determined by something called the White
House correspondence Association which
as you might imagine is a left leaning
organization so they put all the left
leaning people in the
front now does that sound like a good
idea to you that the Press itself
decides that the left leaning people
exclusively get the good seats no it's a
terrible idea so the White House has
decided that they are now in charge of
the seating chart which means that some
of your favorite uh podcasts and
independent journalists might be up
front and boy will that be fun can you
can you imagine you know Mike cernovich
in the FR front row or Alex Jones front
row I I have no idea you know which
individuals are on the list but man
that's going to get good that's going to
get
good so Trump continues to tease about a
third term so NBC is reporting this that
uh one of the ways that could happen uh
allegedly would be if JD Vance and
Donald Trump could run as a ticket where
JD Vance is the head of the ticket but
Trump is vice president and they run for
another another
term and then JD Vince steps down and
Trump becomes president
again now I I saw some experts saying um
no that would be totally illegal you
know the Constitution said or is it the
Constitution I guess says uh you know
two
terms and to me it sounds illegal but I
think Trump said you know maybe it's a
possibility um but he thinks he has
other possibilities to run for a third
term now here's what's weird about
this why is there not more push back on
the fact that he's literally offering to
be essentially some kind of a dictator
who doesn't just take two terms and
leave shouldn't they be saying he's a
dictator we knew it he's trying to never
leave office and then just use this as
their example of why he never wants to
leave office now of course he would
still have to win an election so I don't
I don't believe that any of his schemes
and I'm going to call them schemes I
don't believe any of them involve no
election so that the you know the public
would have to vote for his third term
and uh I think this is a terrible idea
but it's amazing that the Democrats are
all busy with Tesla or whatever they're
worried about or Doge and and this story
doesn't really get much attention and
and Trump is just saying it right out
loud yeah the third term a lot of people
want it maybe we we'll we'll see about
it I'm
interested uh to me it's a gigantic
mistake
but if you wanted to give it the if you
want to give it the most positive
spin uh let me do that I'm going to
reach deep all right this is the Trump
supporter positive
spin do you know what is the bad thing
about being in your second
term people think they can weigh you
out so Trump is creating the possibility
that you can't wait him out that he
might still be here after his term now
that is actually a strong play in terms
of persuasion and in terms of
negotiating if you remove the possib
possibility of waiting for him to be out
of
office he can negotiate much better
while he's in office so if that's what
he's up to it's
brilliant if what he's really up to is
he just doesn't want to leave the job
because he he thinks he'll go to jail
which is a possibility by by the way he
might go to
jail um he might be forced into trying
to stay in
office at whatever age you know in my
opinion that would be too old but he
might be forced to try it just to stay
in at jail so it's
complicated I'm not in favor of him
saying it because I just don't like the
look of it but I can't I can't deny that
it might help his negotiating position
and I can't deny that it might keep him
out of jail so if it were
me and I thought that would keep me out
of
jail I might be looking at it pretty
hard
maybe anyway way you probably all know
that the Wisconsin Supreme Court has a
vacancy and they've got this election on
Tuesday and if it goes the wrong way the
entire country if not the world could be
destroyed uh Elon mus says the Wisconsin
Supreme Court race quote might decide
the future of America and Western
Civilization now if you're like me and
you hear that there's an election in
Wisconsin you probably said to yourself
well that can't affect anything
important but the argument is that if
the left-leaning Supreme Court nominee
or a person running for the the office
if the left learning left leaning one
gets
elected uh that person would support
reapportionment where you decide you
know how many representatives and what
type based on how you draw the lines
that they can redraw the lines to
eliminate
several GOP representatives and actually
flipped the house so control of the
house might depend on this one tiny
election in
Wisconsin which is why you saw Elon Musk
go to Wisconson he's putting a bunch of
money in it to try to get uh the
candidate shimel elected instead of the
farle Leaning
Crawford
um the polls at the moment are too close
to
call so we are right on the border of
losing almost
everything now were you confident that
the Democrats couldn't come up with some
scheme to derail the uh Republicans even
though the Republicans had all the
popular support and you know the
Democrats are in the lowest approval
they've ever been but boy they're good
at the lawfare aren't they they they
know how to use the legal system and
play the system and scheme and you know
both sides do it but Democrats are quite
effective at it
um so Trump had called Crawford the left
leading want a disaster a liberal
lunatic will throw the country into
chaos
chaos now is everybody just calling
everybody an agent of
chaos that is the emptiest word in
politics right now how do you define
chaos everything looks like chaos from
the outside you know all war is chaos or
you know the Congress itself is chaos
the way we make laws is
chaos if if you could call everything
chaos it doesn't really mean a thing so
I cringe a little bit when I see uh
Republicans use it because it's the main
thing that Democrats say their their
biggest argument is oligarch and Chaos
completely
meaningless just those things are not
connected to anything in the real world
and they should be relegated to that's
right the department of imaginary
concerns so if you're worried about all
the
chaos you should probably look to the
Department of imaginary concerns where
they handle all that they've got
policies imaginary policies to handle
the imaginary
chaos anyway but the uh Trump experience
could come to a crashing halt as soon as
this
week and that sucks more than just about
anything I can think about
meanwhile and somehow my head is having
trouble accepting these two thoughts
that even the Democrats think the
Democrats
suck even the Democrats think the
Democrats suck at the same time they
might be ready to take control of the
house how could both of those things be
true it it just feels like you know pick
one so here's an example the New York
Times editorial board uh is going after
Democrats and you know a little late but
at least they're joining the the parade
and they said uh the the uh Democrats
are quote Living in an imaginary
world an imaginary
world where their policies are popular
and they just need to message better and
get out the
[Laughter]
vote now that's a pretty strong thing
right uh and you Democrats quote
obsession with identity politics and
their quote scolding censorious posture
have driven voters straight into
Republicans arms
yes uh and then they say remember this
is the New York Times so you'd expect it
to be the friendliest big publication to
Democrats and they're just they're just
absolutely in their mouths I
mean I think it's
embarrassing to be the New York Times
and be a supporter of Democrats or at
least being seen as supporters of
Democrats and the Democrats being so
pathetic so that so they go on this is
the editorial board of New York Times in
the aftermath of this comprehensive
defeat many Party leaders have decided
that they do not need to make
significant changes to their policies or
their message they have instead settled
on a convenient explanation for their
plight so they're just going to say it's
Elon musk's
problem I think it's the oligarchy and
possibly the chaos
oligarchy and
Chaos so at the same
time that even the most prominent
Democrats are saying oh it looks like
the Democratic party has just completely
Fallen
apart
um the the uh they're ready to take
possibly take control of the house
through clever
means and I hate
that um but but notice the New York
Times use the word imaginary an
imaginary
world that's right because the
department of imaginary concerns is
where all the Democrat problems should
go because they're literally imaginary
they do live quite literally in an
imaginary world I was just watching one
of the anti-tesla
protests and they had some young man
with a beard who is telling the crowd
there are only two things they need to
know one is that
that musk gets they claimed $8 million a
day from the government or something
like that now he doesn't give any
details but the government doesn't give
away money to something like Tesla or I
don't know maybe it's SpaceX I don't
know um unless it's good for the
government or meaning good for the
public and then he says but uh the
people on Social Security will only get
$65 a day and
and also sort of suggesting that that
musk is going to cut that
number now these are not related
numbers he's talking to
morons and let me be clear about this
I'm not saying that old Democrats are
dumb there are plenty of brilliant
Democrats especially the lawyers the
lawyers are pretty
clever but the protesters are
morons the there's no other way around
it the protesters
are
morons and they're cheering for that
like they understand it do they
understand that musk's entire approach
is to protect Social Security and
Medicare payments at at least their
current level and he's the only one who
can do it because if he doesn't get the
national debt under control everybody
loses everything everybody loses
everything and do you think that there's
anybody at a
Tesla protest who has ever even heard
that they don't even understand that we
have a debt crisis and there's literally
only one plan to get it under control
and that's
Doge they are
morons
and well that's pretty much the whole
thing um how many of you think that the
government should defund NPR and put it
on a business in the comments how many
think that's a good idea defund NPR and
put it out of business because they're
too left leaning it's they're pretty
much all
Democrats all right if you think that
you have been fooled by the
news the government only funds 1% of NPR
directly and at most 3%
indirectly so let me let me bring you up
to the smart
people there is no scenario in which the
government cutting funding ends NPR it's
1% of their funding it wouldn't make any
difference at all why are we even
talking about it this is a totally
imaginary concern so the imaginary
problems are not just on one side so I'm
going to take the defund NPR which I
think we should because I don't know why
we're giving them 1% or 3% if you count
the indirect funding I don't know why
we're doing that so I'm in favor of
cutting it but no NPR is not going to go
anywhere yeah how mad are you that you
didn't know that for those of you who
said yes cut the funding and get rid of
NPR how many of you are embarrassed
right now that you thought that cutting
the funding the government funding would
make any difference at
all to me that pisses me off that that I
had to sort of you know deduce that and
figure it out and I think maybe
Katherine M might have said that at one
of the hearings but is your news serving
you because I think your social media
and your news is acting like if that
funding got cut NPR would go
away so yeah no this was a this is a
complete fake story NPR can't go away
not from Government funding being
caught um
um according to Doge so Elon Musk did a
big event in Wisconsin there huge lines
got a big Applause people were thanking
him and gave him a standing ovation for
his extraordinary service to the
country but here's what they found that
millions of non-citizens got Social
Security numbers so the claim is that
from 2021 and it it got bigger and
subsequent years uh that the Biden
Administration was giving illegal let's
say
non-citizens uh Social Security numbers
and registering them to vote and there
some number of them we don't know they
sampled and found out that some number
of them did vote we don't know the
percentage um not only that but they
they were qualified for the maximum
Social Security benefits like right from
the jump and they were automatically
enrolled in Med
Medicaid now I'm going to stick to my um
stick to my
process so I've been burned at least
twice by repeating a claim that Doge
made about something that you know they
they discovered only to hear the
Democrats debunk it in a way that
sounded pretty believable to me
so if this is
true it is how it is one of the ways
that the election was
rigged and it looks like it would be
intentional if this is true however I
would wait to see if there's a counter
to this because the Democrats have been
saying from the start well you make lots
of claims but where's the proof and
that's a good point because Doge isn't
really about showing all their work and
they'll show The Big Numbers they show
the big stuff but it's not about showing
all the details I don't think they're
making databases available for the
public or anything
and maybe there's some other explanation
for some of it I don't know what it
would be you it could be a database
problem as opposed to a real thing but
if it's true then our system was in fact
rigged for the recent elections and
there would be no doubt about it maybe
noted enough because Trump won but this
would have been quite obviously an
attempt to rig the election in in a way
that looks illegal to
me speaking of how bad the uh Democrats
are there was a Republican party of New
Mexico they had a they had a
headquarters that was targeted for arson
so somebody s fire to the Republican
party of New Mexico's had
headquarters now do you think that the
Democrat leadership will disavow this
along with all the other violence
against Tesla owners no they will not
and so I blame them if the leaders don't
disavow this they are encouraging it and
I think that calling uh you know musk
and Trump
Hitler really just gives a a free
pass to any crazy person who wants to be
a
hero I I could stop Hitler all I have to
do is beat up somebody in a cyber truck
and I'm stopping Hiller boy am I a good
person because I haven't done anything
in my life that's worthwhile but at
least I helped stop Hiller by keying a
car so if the Democrat leadership
doesn't say no then I do
think uh some action should be taken
from a from a RICO standpoint point
we'll talk more about
that here here's one that's just blowing
my freaking mind Sawyer Merit is
reporting this apparently in New York
one of the lawmakers senator Pat Fay has
introduced legislation to revoke the
permits for Tesla's five existing direct
sales location so that Tesla would not
be able to sell their
cars in New York state
is the state right yeah not not the city
the
state now I don't know what the odds are
of that being passed you know even in
New York seems like it probably
wouldn't but just think about how evil
and broken and corrupt that
is because there's nobody who thinks
that Tesla the company did anything
wrong in fact Tesla the company is one
of the jewels of American industry
it's the probably the single greatest
contribution to you know decarbonizing
the country if that's what you wanted
you know I'm not arguing you you want
that but if you did want that and you're
a Democrat you would be cutting out your
own
legs and this is pure evil why would you
even think of doing this well it's
because you were told that musk and
Trump are h
there's two hillers now it's double
Hitler and so you would do anything you
could to decapitate
them um so there are at least two more
stories of people in Teslas um who were
stopped and beaten up through the window
of their car a 61-year-old woman and
another gentleman I think he was 70 and
they're literally beating up senior
citizens just because they have Teslas
and I think there are a bunch of other
ones now even in Europe apparently in
Rome there was a facility where 17
Teslas were
torched so it's going
global why would it Go
Global why why would it be happening in
Rome now probably that's just crazy
people copying it doesn't seem
necessarily like that would have been
part of the same movement but you know
maybe just the crazy
spreads anyway Elon mus said it is time
to arrest those funding the attacks
arresting their puppets and paid foot
soldiers won't stop the violence I agree
it will not stop the violence so who is
funding it you might ask and the answer
comes to us from a former Wall Street
Journal reporter named azra nanii so she
was posting today um that there are 24
NOS that are funding this anti-tesla
stuff 24 of them and most of them have
tax deductible
status claiming they're
nonpartisan does this look nonpartisan
to you uh if you have
packs and they're not returning a
requests for comment of course they
not and that they have combined revenue
the 24 ngos of $124 million
now I've got a few
comments how impressed are you that the
Republicans and conservatives are the
most well-armed
segment of American society and maybe
the most well-armed of anyone anywhere
and there's been no real
counter-protest that suggest violence so
there have been a few counter protesters
who are just having their trolling fun
you know it seems like they're just
doing it for clicks you know not really
trying to stop anything but there
haven't been any well-armed people
showing up to counter protest there
haven't been any huge muscular fighting
kind of looking people and there are
lots of
them why is that now I'm not suggesting
it I don't want to see that it would
just cause you know more problems but
I'm really
impressed that the political right has
this much
restraint now there would be a time when
I would say uh well they're they're just
not brave or they're you know they're
not committed but it could be that the
January 6th thing caused everybody to
have
pause because we know that if any if any
uh if any conservative goes anywhere
near a protest they could end up in jail
for five years so maybe that January 6
um
prosecutions completely eliminated the
counter-protest ability or even the
protest ability of one half of the
country and that would be an interesting
outcome but it's possible uh but also
there's no one funding a
counter-protest so this is probably more
evidence that there's no such thing as a
large spontaneous protest I don't really
think there is you know I I've heard
someone say the tea party but I bet the
Tea Party had some funding in the
background I just don't know so as long
as these NOS are funding what is clearly
a destruction of property or they should
know that that's what's going to happen
it does seem like there's a RICO case to
be had but I don't know whose job it is
to make it is that Pam
Bondi I don't know but uh something's
going to happen um I don't I don't think
that the bad guys can just keep pushing
forever and not get a strong response
especially in a
Trump trump presidency so we'll
see uh Rasmus did a poll on musk and say
that now 50% of the people they pulled
now view musk
unfavorably including 41% with a very
unfavorable opinion that's basically the
41% that's basically
just
Democrats so look how quickly the
Democrats can change their opinion of
Elon Musk if the top tells them to
change
it they're pure NPCs they're just told
to change their mind and they did and
they they'll just forget everything he's
doing for the country imagine imagine
being in his head imagine being Elon
Musk you're the richest person the world
and the first thing you have to worry
about is that money will become
useless
because if the US debt crushes the
country his billions of dollars aren't
going to be worth much so he could go
from richest person in the country to
well we're all just struggling to become
cannibals and eat each other you know
which is sort of the
alternative so he's got the most to lose
but also he's got the only plan to save
the country and he's taking remarkable
risks I mean he's got all kinds of death
threats his Tesla's being
attacked he might never be able to
recover he might never be able to just
go in public he probably could never eat
at a restaurant again I mean the the
level of risk he's taking on is
extraordinary and he's doing it for
primarily the benefit of the country and
if you look at all the other stuff he
does they're clearly designed for the
benefit of the country but they also
make money now in this case it's more
for the benefit of the country I don't
see how he's going to make money except
in the in the way we all would make
money if if the country stays in in
business
so I think that doing what he's doing to
save the country in the context of the
Democrats fantasizing that he's doing
the opposite
is one of the
bravest most uh highest
character thing I'll ever see in my
life because generally at least the
people you're trying to save like you
you know if a ship goes over and you
know you pull up and you're saving
people out of the water they don't hate
you do they do half of the people you
pull out of the water and you save their
life do they hate you no generally
speaking when you're saving people lives
and that's what he's doing he's saving
the lives of Americans we're all going
to die if the debt isn't
controlled and fast he is the only
mechanism that can do that let me say it
again we're all going to
die that's how bad it is we're all going
to die he's saving the
country and they're trying to kill
them now that
is pure
evil pure evil and I'm a little bit now
I'm a lot disappointed I'm a lot
disappointed that uh the Department of
Justice hasn't already put the put the
boot on this now I don't know what tools
they have but they got tools I mean
clearly there's some way to shut this
down and if
not um I don't know how ugly it's going
to get but it's not going to get
better well let's talk about signal gate
the story that never
dies um Jeffrey Goldberg was mocking
Mike Waltz for saying that he didn't
know how Jeffrey Goldberg's phone number
got into his phone but Mike Walt said uh
I don't know how it got there sometimes
you know it just gets sucked in with
other phone
numbers
now that's the worst lie
ever so let me just say Mike Waltz is
clearly lying about what
happened unless he doesn't know a single
thing about how the app works but by now
somebody would have told him no phone
numbers don't get accidentally sucked in
somehow I mean even uh I think with
Laura Ingram was interviewing him and
and you should look at her face when
he's trying to do that it got sucked in
by itself she was
[Laughter]
just she went a little bit easy on him I
I think just you know because they're on
the same team in a sense but she wasn't
buying any of it and I don't think any
of us are buying it either so I asked
yesterday on social media what are what
are the technical
possibilities that Mike Waltz really
doesn't know how it happened and that
maybe maybe he was guessing because he
didn't know and he just thought well I
don't know maybe it just got sucked in
there somehow which could indicate that
he doesn't know how it got there that's
possible so I don't think he's
necessarily guilty of doing it himself
he might be but the only thing we know
for sure is that the explanation he gave
was just absolute and I don't
think he's walking it back or anything
so I asked could a uh could a virus or a
Cyber attack um influence the contacts
in signal in other words if somebody had
found a way to penetrate their phones
even though they're you know government
phones and they should be more protected
I guess um could somebody who is you
know the top level let's say a
government entity could they penetrate
his phone and put a uh phone number on
there that wasn't there uh some of the
people said no no there's no way to do
that you cannot do that on an iPhone and
other things like that but other people
who would say stuff like um I'm a cyber
security expert for 20 years you could
absolutely do that and then they would
describe
how but another cyber security expert
said yes you could do it but you
wouldn't want to give away the fact that
you had done it for such a small
win to which is what I said I said that
the other day you would you know if you
were up to no good you wouldn't want to
give away the
game that and then everybody would know
the signal was
compromised other people said well you
know the signal um the head of signal
had been arrested in France recently but
then he made some kind of a deal and he
got released which sort of suggests that
maybe the you know at least the NATO
countries or however you want to
organize this uh you know may have just
gotten the back
door which would allow potentially maybe
one of our foreign
friends that sometimes act like
adversaries to do it maybe they didn't
like what he thought about Ukraine
maybe maybe it came from that direction
we don't know
um but
but here here's the thing that made me
laugh somebody said if you have a signal
app you could have it open on more than
one
device so all it would take is for one
more person in the whole world to know
his
password you wouldn't need to do any
clever cyber security you would just
have to know his
password now my question to you is do
you think that anybody on his staff knew
his password
I'm going to say yes probably yes so if
you knew the password you could just
open it up on another device change the
contact close the app I don't know how
long would it take for somebody to
figure out you did that so I don't know
I'm not going to blame anybody but
everything about that story is
hanky um well you probably have heard
the story by now that uh in France
Marine Leen who was favored to become
the next uh president are they
presidents or prime ministers I'm so
dumb I don't even know that um but the
next leader of the country in the next
election but she was just found guilty
and sentenced to
jail uh and banned for running for
office um says the court The Wall Street
Journal reports that the Court ruled
that Leen and other members of the party
illegally used millions of Euros in
European Union funding that was
earmarked for assistance helping
lawmakers in the European Parliament
with their work but instead judges said
Leen and her lawmakers used the money to
pay party staffers that would be people
on their own
staff U or in their own party who
weren't involved and working for the
parliament so the the funding was
diverted to another use but leen's
argument was uh that it was appropriate
to move that funding or to use it for
that purpose um because the uh
assistants were political AIDS and not
direct employees of the European
Parliament now I don't really understand
that defense but it kind of looks to me
a little law fairish doesn't it have you
noticed that with the uh the Trump
lawfare when you heard what the charges
were you you would say really can you
explain that again like that's not like
I understand murder and I understand
theft and I understand most crimes but
why do I not understand these 34
felonies that don't make any sense and
you know what is this with egene Caroll
and how do you turn that into something
and you know they all have that quality
where you go to yourself huh really and
and even if this funding were used
incorrectly
wouldn't that be more at least in the
United States wouldn't it be a civil
case wouldn't you sue her and say Hey
give us back our European Union money
that you used in the wrong way why is it
even a crime as opposed to a civil
disagreement where the courts decide who
gets the
money so it looks very
suspicious um now let's put it in
context as Mike Benz helps us
do apparently uh as you know she's not
the first populist leader who has been
taken out by lawfare as Ben points out
uh it's Marine Leen in France bolsonaro
in Brazil Imran Khan in Pakistan Mato
salvinia in Italy and Donald Trump in
America and uh uh georgescu in Romania
all coincidentally got taken out by
lawfare all coincidentally
populace do you see the
pattern populists just get taken out by
suspicious
lawfare now I don't know how many of
them were guilty guilty and how many of
them were just doing what everybody does
all the time and they just figured out a
way to laware it but uh that's pretty
creepy and terrible
um now Leen will be challenging you know
so she'll be challenging in a higher
Court I guess so we'll see how that goes
but oh my
God uh meanwhile uh Eric abanti is uh
summarizing for us a uh one of the
authors of abundance that book that says
that if Democrats could act more like
Republicans they might
succeed that's not what the book says
that's that's my humorous summary of it
which isn't too far off but Derek
Thompson was one of the two authors with
Ezra Klein and but here's what he says
just listen to this something has
happened in the last 50 years of
liberalism the rules that we wrote in
the 60s to protect the environment have
created strictures and rules that keep
us from building the things we need in
the 2020s like housing and energy when
you give that power at the local level
he has the ability to stop development
entirely and that's really what we've
seen in so many areas that are governed
by liberals and then he says the five
states with the highest rates of
homelessness are all governed by
Democrats every single time he add
10% uh vote share of progressives the
number of housing permits declines by
30% so as an area becomes more liberal
it permits fewer
homes now this is you know one anecdote
of many so basically the Liberals are
all about restricting things don't don't
do this don't do that at the same time
that they need things they need energy
they need affordable homes so they're
completely self-
ulating the the Democrats are filled
with idiots honestly they're just a lot
of idiots who don't who can't tell that
there's a some kind of a con ction
between all of these restrictions and
the fact that they can't get anything
built so I do think I'll say it again
that the authors of abundance have done
quite a good service in trying to wake
up the Democrats to you know get rid of
uh regulations that are
unnecessary like
Republicans so maybe if they become more
like Republicans will have
something meanwhile um Trump as mad as
lens for backing out of the mineral deal
did I did I predict that zalinsky would
not accept the mineral deal I think I
did right because I don't think Putin or
zalinski are going to accept any deal
about anything I think they will say
they exit that they're going to do it
and then as soon as you know our
negotiators walk out the door they're
going to do a press event and say well
you know we can't really do that but if
you added a bunch of things to the deal
that we want and you don't want uh then
we might do a deal so that's why Trump
is mad at Putin and now he's mad at
zalinski for trying to back out of the
mineral deal and he said zalinsky I see
he's trying to back out of the rare
Earth mineral deal and if he does that
he's got big problems we made a deal on
Rare Earth and now he's saying I want to
renegotiate but I do
wonder if the
negotiators are maybe making agreements
that couldn't be accepted by the boss
so there might be a little bit of the
fact that zinsky isn't in the
negotiations you know something's Just
Happening without him so he's just going
to kill everything that he wasn't
involved with
um anyway meanwhile Trump says he's
going to bomb Iran if they don't accept
a new nuclear deal and he gave him two
months now this is a problem because
Trump doesn't
Bluff and he just said he'll bomb ran if
they don't accept a new nuclear deal and
they're never going to accept a new
nuclear
deal so did he just basically tell us in
two months he's going to bomb
Iran because that's what it sounds like
to me do you think that they could bomb
Iran
enough that it would once and for all
get rid of their nuclear
program I can't imagine how deep you
know in the mountain they've they've
tunneled to protect that stuff but even
our our biggest bunker
Busters would we know exactly where all
the places are that we need to hit how
long would it take him to just
reconstitute it if if we even took it
down completely which seems
unlikely I'm not really seeing this as
being a winning play unless Iran goes
for it as you know they're just worried
that it's going to happen now they
should be worried that it's going to
happen because like I say Trump isn't
big on bluffing he probably plans to
bomb um but that's going to open up the
question whether the United States is
just doing Israel's bidding to bomb all
of their
enemies and I have to say it would look
a lot like that so you you know you're
on your own to come up with your own
narrative that fits the facts but it
sure would look like the United States
was just a puppet of Israel and was at
least that's how people would interpret
it so again you can make an argument
that it's in the US's best interest as
well or that we're protecting an ally or
that we're just making sure that part of
the world doesn't become more of a hell
hole than it already is so you can make
an argument either way but you know that
at least half the country is going to
say um did Israel just get us into a
terrible
War
so if Trump's not bluffing on that
things are going to get get real spicy
in about two
months anyway um and Iran's supreme
leader said if the US did that that uh
we would receive a strong reciprocal
blow which is probably not nearly as fun
as this
sounds all right ladies and gentlemen
that's all I've got for you today I'm
going to go back to my limping
around and uh I'm going to say a few
