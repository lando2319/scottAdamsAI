good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you'll never have a better
time than this today sorry uh but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
stratospheric levels the kind that
nobody can even imagine all you need is
a CER mug or glass a tanker chal's iron
a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee enjoy me now now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine of
the day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous
zp this is called product placement
people yeah it's a thing it just where
your your product just shows up
someplace in the middle of your
video that's right if you have not
bought my book reframe your brain that's
changing lives like crazy according to
readers you should also I just want to
give you a little tease if you're not
subscribing to either locals or the
subscription for me for my stuff on uh
the xplatform then you're not seeing
Dilbert
reborn and you will not see the exciting
conclusion of what happens when
Dilbert's Mom starts dating a fan of
Andrew
Tate I don't want to I don't want to be
a spoiler but I'm just
saying
you can imagine you can imagine all
right here's some uh stuff uh let's see
some sciency stuff that you didn't need
to you didn't need to do the science you
should have just asked me I think this
will be my new category do we need to do
a study or could we just ask Scott and
see what he
says um
apparently being a vegetarian is partly
genetic meaning that there are some
people who don't don't metabolize fat
the same and therefore meat doesn't give
them the buzz that it gives other people
and makes them
sick uh I'm one of those people people
ask me why I stopped eating meat I do
eat fish these days but I stopped eating
meat because I got a stomach ache every
time I did it like a huge stomach ache
so I might be one of these people but
you didn't really have to ask me if
being a vegetarian is genetic is there
anybody who thought it wasn't
did anybody think that being a
vegetarian was simply a lifestyle
preference of course it's
genetic do you know what else is genetic
alcoholism do you know when I knew that
oh about 20 years before science knew it
because it was obvious do you know when
I knew that being a vegetarian not for
everybody some people do pick it for
lifestyle choices I'm sure but uh did I
know that some people people were
naturally vegetarians yes I
did to me it was obvious it's been
obvious for
decades uh about uh that uh gay people
have a different genetic makeup was I
surprised to learn that no because that
was obvious for decades before science
figured it out so if you want to wait
for science you can but it'll be decades
after I tell you what's true now what
about alcohol is uh actually good for
you if if if uh take it in
moderation well science lied to you
about that for about 50 years but if you
listen to me from the very start I said
nope that's just science
there's no way that any of it's good for
you and now we know it's
not uh speaking of science here's
another
study I don't even know why I bother
science is so ridiculous now but uh
there's a study by uh see the lead
author is Professor wrath he says that
uh half of the population will develop
at least one disorder mental disorder by
the age of 75 so in other words half of
Americans will have mental health
disorders in their lifetime
half so how do you explain
that uh let me explain it follow the
money follow the money we now have this
enormous uh industry that will give you
a pill or give you therapy or make you
watch some Tik Tok videos or something
else so once we
monetized uh mental health disorders
were you going to get more of them or
few of them you going to get a lot more
yeah everything you form a group to look
for you're going to find more when uh
the ADL was formed to look for bigotry
do you think they found any well there
was plenty to find but do you think they
found any that wasn't really there oh
yes of course they did so you're going
to find everything that's there and a
lot of stuff that isn't there if you're
looking but on top of that I do think
our entire system makes people mentally
ill there's definitely a difference in
mental illness compared to when I was a
kid or here's the other
possibility if nobody told you you were
mentally ill would you know
it what if we had just as much mental
illness before but there were no names
for it and we were not all familiar with
all the various types if you sat me down
and said Scott make a list of all the
potential types of mental illness I
could have a pretty long list do you
think I could have done that when I was
I don't know
15 no I would have thought um let's see
I've heard of
schizophrenia um and uh maybe fear of
crowds or something and I wouldn't have
been able to even I wouldn't have even
been able to come up with three I don't
think depressed I don't even know if
Depression was a thing when I was a kid
I don't remember anybody who said they
had it or anxiety any of it I don't
remember any of it as a kid so what if
everybody had those problems but if they
didn't have a name for it they just
thought it was that happens in
their head and maybe other people have
 in their heads and and we're all
just
different and I also
wonder if half of the country has a
mental illness or disorder as they call
it who gets to determine what's
normal you know where where's that line
of normal if half the kids have a mental
illness at some point it just becomes
who we are I mean aren't we all a little
bit crazy one way or another anyway I
got questions about these numbers but it
does seem like they're more mentally
unhealthy people for one reason or
another
um
so how many of you have seen the clip of
Bill Mah he went on a few different talk
shows and he talked about how the uh
Democrats are poorly served by their own
news which is interesting to hear a
Democrat or somebody who leans Democrat
say that that they were poorly served by
their own news the example he gives is
that when people were ped uh what are
the odds that you would end up in the
hospital if you got Co and apparently uh
people on the left political left
thought it was a really big number and
the the real number is you know under 2%
now that was a really good example of
where their news has completely
Bamboozled them I mean just wildly but
is there anything else like that how
about if you were to ask I'm just
guessing but if you were to ask the
Democrats and
Republicans um if the number of deaths
from extreme weather have gone up or
down
recently I feel like I don't know this
but I feel like Democrats would say oh
yeah that extreme weather from all the
climate change so there's more extreme
weather because there's more climate
change more extreme weather equals more
deaths yes there must be a great
increase in the number of deaths the
reality is it's at an all-time low do
you think they would know that yeah how
about the
hoaxes if I ran through the list of the
hoaxes find people hoax the drinking
bleach hoax you know just go down the
list how many Democrats would recognize
those as hoaxes they wouldn't because
the news told them they were all
real so they wouldn't know any of the
hoaxes they wouldn't know the most
important elements of climate change
which is their biggest
issue uh they wouldn't know about
hospitalization for coid the biggest
thing that happened in the country for
years and then there's another one I
just saw some
statistics um
people were asked how many how many
people were killed by police who were
black in 2021 so the survey was
2021 uh 40% of liberals thought the
number was over a thousand in in America
per year they 40% of liberals people who
were very liberal thought it was over a
thousand the real number was 11 it was
11 people and how many of the 11 had it
coming meaning that if he knew the
details you would have said to yourself
oh well I can see why they shot those
11 how many of the 11 probably at least
nine or 10 you'd look at it and say yeah
they definitely should have been shot so
the number who who are shot who should
not have been shot maybe
two out of thousands and thousands and
thousands of
arrests still too many of course but
conservatives didn't say that only 16%
of conservatives thought it was over a
thousand which is way too much what
conservative thinks that the number of
black people killed by police per year
is over a
thousand 16% of
conservatives now if you asked what is
their primary news source what do you
think they'd
say probably not Fox News probably not
Breitbart they'd probably say see you
that it's probably their primary source
of news there must there a lot of
households where you've got a
conservative and a liberal in the same
house and one of them controls the TV so
the per the other person doesn't see
real news so there might be a whole
bunch of conservatives who think they're
seeing real news on CNN because their
spouse watches
it just a guess so I would like to see a
more uh more comprehensive survey to see
if people on the left or the right are
even informed about the important stuff
you know other questions you could
imagine would be um is Generation 3
nuclear
energy more or less dangerous
than um the
Alternatives you know stuff like that
you know conservatives would know that
Generation 3 there's never been a death
never those are the new ones that you
would build today if you if if you
started today it would either be
generation three or four four would be
built in a way that it couldn't melt
down no matter what happened three could
but they've done them so well that none
has none has had a catastrophic
problem all right how many would know
that
um some new information about college
degrees the percentage of uh young
adults who said that a college degree is
very important is now down to 41% it was
74% over 10 years ago this is in the New
York Times so 10 years ago three4 of the
country said oh yeah college education
is important and today 41% what
changed what changed in 10
years College became worthless that's
what in the last 10 years College went
awoke and became
ridiculous and and way too expensive so
the price is going way up the value you
get out of it is way down who would want
to send their kid to a woke
College well woke people I guess but uh
the rest would not want them to come
back all woken IED do you remember the
uh the other day I told you Bloomberg
had done a study that said after George
Floyd was
killed that um the this The Fortune 100
companies their new hires only six % of
them were white and it was outrageous
because it would look like they were all
overcompensating do you know how they
got that 6%
number well the daily wire did a little
Deep dive and looked into it here's how
they got the 6% number is something
called not knowing how to do math at all
that's the whole
story The the numbers are not even close
to 6% it's actually closer to the way
it's always been so the real story is
nothing really changed after George
Floyd in terms of
hiring which is good news in one sense
because there wasn't an
overreaction now if you think that the
Baseline was good that's a separate
question but there wasn't an
overreaction there was you know some
small statistical
difference so once again we learned that
journalists can't do
math we've always learned that
scientists can't do to
statistics I mean the fact that two
highly qualified
statisticians that Martin called off and
um Nate silver are having a total
disagreement about the same same set of
data they're looking at the same data
and they can't decide what it says two
are the best in the business
so there's almost no data that's
useful and it's really hard to accept
that
but it is true data is almost all
motivated it's motivated by somebody or
it's just you know done wrong and when
it's done wrong it seems to agree with
the motivation of the person who did it
wrong that's pretty consistent because
otherwise You' never see
it well um but of course at least our
climate change science is good right
there's a new study that says uh uh new
study measured how much CO2 is released
from rocks into the atmosphere
rocks that's right so if it rains for
example there's like a slight bit of
erosion from
rocks it turns out that rocks could add
as much CO2 to the atmosphere as
volcanoes and currently this process is
not included in most climate
models so there's something as big as
volcanoes which are very big in terms of
CO2 that are not included because they
didn't know about it till
now it's the
Rocks so do you know what the plan is to
uh prevent the rocks from off gasing the
CO2 they're going to bury
them you're going to bury all the
Rocks Under
dirt now I'm making that up that's not
real that's not real they're not going
to bury the rocks it would just be funny
wouldn't it or ban them ban the
Rocks they're going to make rocks
illegal get rid of the Rocks rocks must
die I think it would be hilarious to
have a climate protest against
rocks am I right what would be funnier
than that like you know actually get a
permit invite you know thousands of
people and have them March no more rocks
no more
rocks I think it'd be
funny yes and uh do you know how many
how much of the CO2 comes from Black
Rock okay that's a pun on Black Rock
being a big company wasn't a very good
pun I just saw it in the comments and
stole it probably should have held back
on that one yeah so uh we didn't include
rocks in those models is there anybody
you know who's been telling you for a
long time the models can't predict the
future not even a little bit not ever
not in this case not in any
case yeah but we believe they
can here's another story about Biden's
dementia so I guess a ex ESPN host named
Sage
Steel I guess she was on uh Bill Mars's
show uh the uh Club random
and she said that interviewing Joe Biden
was quote the saddest thing as he
couldn't finish his
sentences so she said so forget about
politics I don't care I didn't vote for
him steel told uh Bill
Mah uh she thinks he's a terrible
president but she says however uh that
made me sad she said of his
confusion now another sub part of the
story is that the Washington Post is
running the story so the Washington Post
as you know likes their Democrats but
it's pretty clear that uh the word is
going out that Biden will be pushed out
I think he's going to try to stay in
there I I think the entire system is
going to try to push him out but they're
going to try it too gently because they
can't be too aggressive or too
obvious and I think his stubbornness
will be greater than their
subtlety so I think he's going to stay
even though his side is going to try
really hard to push him out because he's
an old demented man and he doesn't want
to quit by saying he's demented if you
have dementia the last thing you want to
do is say you know I'm going to have to
step down cuz honestly I got a bad case
of dementia and it's just getting worse
so s Sage Steel is a great name isn't it
your first name makes you sound smart
your last name makes you sound strong
Sage Ste sounds like a superhero
name yes Sage Steel I like it all right
so this next uh category is the things
that Trump was right about are you ready
for this things that Trump was right
about um I made a prediction in 2021
that the longer Trump was out of office
the better he would
look let's see if there are any examples
in the real world of things that make
Trump look better than he did well as
you might remember um Joe Biden was very
anti Saudi Arabia and its leader the
Crown Prince for uh possibly or probably
ordering a uh Bona related murder of a
Critic which we consider a bad
form and so Biden was very very tough on
it said Trump was some kind of a weird
Trader for even doing business with that
guy uh let's see if there's any news
stories oh here's a scoop uh cedor Biden
advisers quietly visited Saudi Arabia
last week and met Crown Prince Muhammad
bin Salman to discuss a mega
deal so so Biden's going to do a mega
deal with the guy that he said they can
never do business with because he's a
big old murderer so I'm going to say
that Trump was right that even if you
don't like what uh
MBS has done or will do that you might
need to deal with them so let's say
Trump was right about
that
um I saw this question uh from un
Hoodwink on X what percentage of woke
liberals would rather die by the hands
of their publicly promoted ideology in
other words open borders and defunding
the police uh vers ver admit they were
wrong and then work with the right to
fix the problems now what do you think
how many Democrats would literally now
we're talking literally literally
actually die how many would actually
choose a high well not certainty of
death but how many would choose a large
percentage chance of dying violently
rather than admit they're
wrong it's probably 90%
that's my guess because that's how
cognitive dissonance works until their
final breath they would still think they
were right there would be no point that
would ever change their mind because
once you're really really committed to
an
opinion you will actually risk your life
so you don't have to change
it you wouldn't take certain death if I
gave you a choice of all right yeah you
can hold that opinion but in five days
you will be dead for sure and we
guarantee it well that might change
somebody's opinion because we have a
survival Instinct but if you said
there's you know your
opinions a really higher chance you're
going to get killed like substantially
higher they would say I know but it's
the principle of the thing so no I don't
think the risk of being killed by their
own policies would change their minds I
don't think that's how minds work we
just stick with what we thought was true
and we never leave
basically
all right
um IBM uh
predicted not long ago at CEO previously
predicted that IBM would have to shed
30% of their
Workforce because AI would replace too
many
people do you remember what I've been
saying does anybody remember my
prediction about Ai and
employment I said it's could to be more
like the invention of the printer or the
computer
we just find more things for people to
do and then we hire them to do those
things instead or do them faster um but
IBM now after its CEO had said they
might lose 30% of the employees to AI
says uh it foresees no l layoffs due to
Ai and the company will hire more
workers than it lets go so it's actually
going to grow workers instead of
shedding
30% I'm going to take credit for being
right on this pred
tentatively I mean you'd have to see a
lot more time and a lot more companies
doing stuff to be to be uh
sure but I think AI will not affect
overall employment it will definitely
change the mix of jobs like dramatically
but I don't think it'll change the
overall employment rate by
itself so that's my contrarian
prediction um the Navy now has print on
demand parts so if you're on a ship at
Sea and something breaks you can't
easily take the you know take the
cruiser back to a port or or fly
something in easily now they can just
print apart they can actually just
create a part and install it and they've
already done it
once they installed a crucial piece on
one of its nuclear submarines now I
don't feel comfortable with
this I don't want my nuclear submarines
necessarily to have too many 3D printed
Parts if you know what I mean it might
have been you know maybe a part that
wouldn't accidentally launch a missile
so that would be good you know may maybe
fix the interface a little bit or
something but no I wouldn't want it to
be one of the components of the nuclear
missiles so but I don't think we're
doing
that well the most important news the
day is that commander of the dog um Joe
Joe Bon's dog no Joe Biden not Biden
just seems like it should be Joe Biden
um so that that dog will be removed from
the White
House um I believe it's being accused of
being a magga domestic terrorist because
that's what they do with anything they
don't like and they had a few different
ways to uh to handle this but one was to
remove the dog
completely uh but they also considered
building a wall around it
yeah it's called a
cage but uh they could have built a wall
around the dog but they decid to get rid
of it um now I don't know if you've put
together 2 plus two but in the past week
not only has speaker McCarthy been
removed from
office but Commander the dog has been
removed the White House and that does
leave us with no leadership
whatsoever
it's quite a leadership hole we've
created here because I pretty sure
Commander the dog was in charge of uh
domestic policy
anyway well let's see
um I saw a post by uh Peter
xan on about
Ukraine and uh he said this he said all
administrations have their blind spots
Ukraine is
Biden's so Ukraine is his blind spot now
I'm thinking where's this
going where's this going so Ukraine is
Biden's blind spot uh so but Peter xan
says luckily it is easy to make the case
uh to make the case that aid for Ukraine
is a core American interest Biden just
needs to address the nation just as
Clinton did for Kosovo uh W bush did for
Iraq Bush Senor did for Panama and
Reagan did for the 80s defense buildup
so it's easy to make the case that aid
for Ukraine is a core American
interest is it is that easy you think I
would have heard that argument by now
but I haven't have you if any of you
heard an argument why Ukraine is
America's core
interest I I've heard it's the only
thing that will keep China from taking
over
Taiwan which I think is just laughably
stupid it's just laughably stupid I'm
not even going to I'm not even going to
address that would you agree the thought
that whatever happens to Ukraine the
thought that that would have anything to
do with China's decision about Taiwan
I'm not even going to talk about it
that's just too stupid that
that's just too many levels of
abstraction all right um but the other
argument is let's see I heard one
argument from a politician saying but
don't you realize that 30% of the the
world's wheat comes from Ukraine to
which I say why would that stop if you
if Ukraine loses the
war is Russia going to stop making wheat
or is it going to be one one year of you
know not as much
wheat I don't know I'm not sure that
that's a and the problem in the United
States wouldn't be people starving it
would be that the wheat cost I don't
know 30% more so we would just eat less
bread and would eat more
vegetables is that is that a core
American interest that there might be
let's say one year of low wheat
production if something happened in
Ukraine that's that's a core American
interest now what about uh what about
stopping uh Putin's war of aggression
where if we don't stop him now he'll
just keep taking over
countries don't don't you think he just
makes every decision
individually or or do we believe that he
had this one big decision I must take
over everything I'm just going to take
over everything and it doesn't matter
what the situation is I'll take it over
if it's bordering my country just going
to take it over is that the way he
thinks or might he look at every
situation
individually and his Ukraine opinion is
different than his opinion of every
place else I feel like
I feel like he probably treats them all
as individual
decisions do you think that he would uh
move on
Poland uh to me the Ukraine situation
showed that his military can't conquer
another country uh even one that he he
believed to be weak he certainly can't
take a a NATO
country yeah
so I hear what Peter Zan says that it
would be easy to make the case but I've
never heard the case in what in a way
that sounds even like a little bit
plausible now there's a trick
that uh people do in the news all the
time which is to imagine that there's
only one
choice and the choice that they imagine
is we either support Ukraine or we give
it all to Russia is that the those are
the only choices what about the most
most likely Choice why would you leave
the most likely outcome out of your two
choices the most likely outcome is we
say look we don't want to fund Ukraine
anymore but we're going to if you don't
if you don't do a peace deal that you
know negotiates these border regions the
obvious other solution is you negotiate
a piece that keeps everybody largely
where they are at the moment and then
you you know give some guarantees about
the future Etc but
why do we think the choice is to fight
forever or Surrender when by far the
most obvious thing is to say all right
it's a draw you know this should
discourage you from invading another
country because you can see that we can
just stop you so why don't we just
negotiate peace go back to business as
usual here's why you can't make a good
case because the real case you can't
tell the American people can you the
real reason they can't say out loud the
real reason is it's an energy War we
don't want Russia to first of all make
all the money that our companies could
make and second of all to have that much
power over people by being in control of
their
energy it's a pure energy War if you
made if you made that argument to me
believe it or not I might be persuaded
by
it it sounds purely evil but in the real
world
Wars are about resources and usually
energy and it's probably just a way to
guarantee that America stays the
dominant superpower for the next 50
years because if Russia you know got
enough money from its energy production
and got enough control over the over
Europe you could really easily see how
Putin could dominate Europe it' be easy
to see so there would be an argument but
you'd have to say that things that you
can't say which is yes Ukraine is
totally
corrupt uh but we'd rather make sure our
energy companies get the business that
would otherwise go to Putin because if
he has the money he's going to do bad
stuff with
it but you can't say that out
loud because then it's an optional War
all
right of course we're going to talk
about the border
wall um so the head of home Homeland
Security secretary Al Alejandro mayoras
who's been very anti-wall as has Joe
Biden been anti-wall but now quote there
is presently an acute and immediate need
to construct physical barriers and Roads
huh physical barriers what would be what
would be an example of a physical
barrier and what would the what would be
the way a normal non jerk would
say it probably wall
wall yeah but if you're as big a loser
as this my Arcus guy is you got to call
it a a physical physical barrier so you
don't it's not as obvious what a weasel
you've been and how much damage you've
done to the country by not having a
border so uh I'm going to put this on
the
category of uh things Trump was right
about that the other side had to pretend
they were against because so they could
be against whatever he was for and it
couldn't be much more obvious than this
one so I would say that Trump has been
right about police and needing more of
them and don't defund them he was right
about the Border he was right about
China he was probably right about
Iran um he was right about
energy he was right about a lot and it's
getting more and more obvious so here
are some of my predictions just to
remind you I said the Republicans would
be
hunted um and there's a good chance
you'll be dead in a year and we can see
the crime wave and people getting killed
in cities especially that journalist
recently makes us think that uh it's an
unsafe place to live but how about that
Republicans would be hunted well uh the
federal
government is so concerned about
domestic violence that the FBI has
created a whole category of
extremists and they're called Donald
Trump's Army of magga
followers that's right the FBI has
decided that magga people should be um
followed closely for being domestic
terrorists uh and it's the FBI that will
do it and
my God uh this so this is a Newsweek
report something
leaked um so Biden is trying to defeat
domestic terrorism by targeting one
political group for political
terrorism do you think that you would
make magga people less likely to bomb
the capital by targeting
them
unfairly I'm pretty sure this would
radicalize more people than it would C
hatch so this seems like the worst idea
in the
world um but here we are so I don't
think we can any longer argue that
Republicans are not being
haunted would you all give me that that
that uh prediction which is pretty out
of left field was right this is clearly
right the the January 6 people were
obviously hunted a number of public
figures were cancelled for reasons that
sounded like other reasons but really
weren't they were it was about taking
the the better voices off the
field yeah it's it's as it's as bad as I
said it would
be and when I when I wrote that tweet I
have to say I just felt it you know the
I felt it like the moment before I wrote
it I just had this feeling it's like oh
 the way they're the way that they
campaigned and talked about trump it
became very obvious that that rhetoric
would translate into action that looked
like this because they were saying it
they were saying it clearly from the
start that magga people were terrorists
in versions of that so you could see it
coming from a mile away and here it
is um see the FTC is going after Amazon
so apparently they had this special
algor called project
Nessie that worked by manipulating
Rivals weak pricing
algorithms so
somehow um what I think this means
is either their their own in-house
products were competing against the
professional products or maybe there was
one they had a greater profit margin
from so they would push that instead of
the other one but apparently uh this was
bad behavior According to some people
the FTC um and it led competitors to
raise their prices and charge customers
more so that was pretty
sketchy so we'll see if that was all
true because it's subject of a court
case so maybe it wasn't true you never
know so here's the funniest thing I
realized yesterday that do you remember
Adam
Schiff um wanted to be the next senator
from California so he was in the he was
in the house of Representatives but
Gavin newon said he was going to promote
a black woman to that job and then he
did and I just realized that Adam Schiff
was passed over for
promotion because he's a white
man just just hold that in your head
Adam Chef
specifically him specifically he was
passed over for a promotion because he's
a white
man how much do you how much do you
think he loves his team today oh yeah
Democrats something tells me the next
time he goes into the shift he's not
going to
lie I think he got a little closer to
being a republican is what I
think
cuz that can only happen to you so many
times before you start saying hey I
don't think the intentions here are are
really in the right
Direction yep Adam Schiff was passed
over for promotion because he's a white
male I me I just like saying that and it
makes me wonder where's the ADL
shouldn't the ADL be defending him he is
a Democrat they should be defending him
against this
discrimination but they're nowhere to be
seen oh but they are advertising again
on the xplatform I think they should
have been kicked off the xplatform but
if they're going to give Elan must money
I guess that's
okay Jim Jordan representative Jim
Jordan who's been floated as the
potential uh next speaker of the house
he tweeted this yesterday does anyone
does anyone feel safe in Democrat run
cities Democrat run
cities and I thought to myself what an
interesting choice of words Democrat run
cities CU if I go into the City and I
see a Democrat com toward me I'm going
to
run so Democrat run run it's a Democrat
run
City yeah that's what it's called a
Democrat run
City well speaking of a lack of free
speech apparently V ramaswami and Chris
Christie had agreed with each other that
they would go on a show I think on Fox
and
debate and the the uh Republican party
shot that down and told them they
couldn't do
that to which I
say what when did the Republican Party
become the No Free Speech
party like I get I get the Republicans
have to act like Republicans and you
want to be on the same team and all
but
seriously seriously you can't let two
people running for president debate each
other on your TV show
and and when I first heard that VI was
going to have a conversation with Chris
Christie the first thing I thought was
that might be the first time you saw a
debate where something like a debate
happened the the way the debates are
done for the TV audience you know with
seven or eight people up there and then
the questions maybe not the questions
you you would have asked not really
useful I mean it's a good event it's a
show event but it's not really useful
for voters but to oneon-one
where they could spend some time really
digging into the other person's point of
view I would watch that all day but
apparently the Republicans won't let it
happen so there's your free speech group
right
there
um Carl Ro did this big editorial in the
Wall Street Journal uh trying to mock
Matt gates for throwing the throwing the
Congress into chaos by outing the
speaker
and I read the whole thing and my only
take on it was there's something wrong
with Carl
Rove I don't know if I could go further
but I read his I read his thing about
Matt Gates and it was his choice of
words his choice of
words very
clearly U said that his opinion was
 and it was just some weird
political thing that he he prefers some
I guess he preferred
McCarthy
but I kind of thought he was a straight
shooter until I saw his editorial and it
was just it looked like a Democrat wrote
it really and you can you know what I
mean right it it was tons of
insults that weren't necessary to the
point you know it's like a little too
hyperbolic so I don't trust anybody but
I definitely don't trust anybody who's
mad at Matt Gates for kicking the
speaker out you you immediately lose my
trust when you have a strong opinion
that that should not have gone on
because we could all see that the
current situation wasn't getting us any
results and we could all keep
it politics aside if your speaker makes
a a public promise to your own team and
then doesn't keep it it doesn't matter
if he was effective in all the other
stuff that is grounds for removal
period because it doesn't look like he
ever meant to keep
that maybe he did yeah maybe events
overtook him so he was either incapable
of delivering it or never meant
to yeah so I'm very in favor of Matt
Gates this week the worst attack on him
I saw was one other member of Congress
saying that prior to his marriage and
this is stated directly prior to his
marriage uh he once bragged about taking
Ed meds and slamming uh Power drinks so
he could go all
night oh oh well I didn't know he that
he
was aggressively flagrantly
heterosexual so that changes everything
he was super
heterosexual before he was married so
before
marriage he had a lot of
sex I don't know I just I can't be okay
with all that heterosexual single person
sex I mean that's just too far I should
note that there are no criminal charges
for anything there are no criminal
charges for anything he did but they're
going to make fun of him for figuring
out which chemicals allow him to have
sex all
night while you're sitting home eating
popcorn with your
spouse
so I'm a pro Matt gates for for all this
stuff all
right I don't know if this story is true
but there's a story of the Ukrainian
president zeny's wife when they were in
New York uh she allegedly spent more
than a million dollars on cardier
jewelry at the same time zinsky was
asking for money and weapons from the
United Nations now doesn't that one feel
a little too on the
nose do you think that really
happened it's definitely possible I
wouldn't say it's impossible definitely
possible but it's so on the nose
right could could there be a story that
you know not since amelda Marcos In Her
Shoes has there been a story that was
like just right on the point like that
right on the point I don't know I'm a
little skeptical of it I'm I'm going to
say wait wait two days on this one if in
two days the story doesn't change it
might be
real but this one just has that feel
about it it has the feel of fake news
just all over it whether it is or not I
don't know could be true I give it two
days um gallb says that the appetite for
a third party is pretty high um 75% of
self-identified independents support a
third party support creation of a third
party which is weird because we have
third parties
already
um 58% of Republicans endorse the idea
and 46% of
Democrats that kind of suggests that RFK
Jr has a has a
path I I always thought he was way more
of a Dark Horse than he's been given
credit for
if he goes third party which I think
he's doing primarily so he has freedom
of speech so they won't ban him on
social media uh he actually could
win yeah let let me say it clearly I'm
not predicting a win not predicting it
but if he wins I want you to know I said
yeah that's there's a path he he just
has a path there are enough disgruntled
people that if the only thing that
happened is you saw lots of trump
arguing with Biden
whoever's not Trump arguing with Biden
is going to look better every
day just every day because both Biden
and Trump will just be dumped on with
you know just everything and whoever is
just going along and making a little
news on the
side I don't like big Pharma do you no I
don't oh well we agree on that yeah I
feel like he's just going to stay under
the radar maybe slip in at the end it's
possible
uh not probable but it's
possible and and here's another story
that I can't
believe I think it's true but is it true
that Trump's attorney uh
accidentally check the box that says
they don't want a jury trial and that
he's not going to get a jury trial
because the lawyer checked the wrong
box that was fake news
right but is it a jury trial
so so the first question is is it a jury
trial right so I think it's no jury
trial but is the claim that the lawyer
made a mistake the reason that
parts that so some of this is fake right
some of the story all right well I'm
just going to say we don't know but that
judge uh engeron he's a little bit too
happy he seems to enjoy his job too much
which makes you feel uncomfortable
because he doesn't seem like he's as
serious as you'd want him to be I mean
sure he's a nice guy I mean when I when
I see him I think oh I could hang out
with him he'd be fun but he's not really
sending a judge Vibe that's going to
hurt
him all right and that ladies and
gentlemen is my prepared
comments is there any any uh big story I
missed
today what am I
forgetting
uh so judge jine said that no
conservative would go for RFK
Jr really well he definitely has
policies that no conservative could
approve
but I don't know I don't know there may
be just bad feelings yeah all it would
take is Trump to do something that he's
not done yet that was some new
outrage and RFK Jr would only be going
up against Biden so I think he's got a
shot has ideas that aren't insane I
don't know about
that uh RFK Jr thought a border wall was
racist until a month ago
what's the problem do you have a problem
that there's somebody who changes his
mind based on researching it himself and
getting better facts how is that a
problem uh he was in a he was in a bar
band all right
fix his voice please I might be able to
do that it's possible I
could all
right literally ask followers what they
want him to
fix all right uh ladies and gentlemen do
you think uh Ukraine's in trouble
because we won't be able to fund them
what what do you think is going to
happen in Ukraine are they going to get
their
funding I think they'll probably be fine
um but one way or another it's going to
be negotiated I think something close to
the current border K CLA Schwab what
about
him I feel like you want to talk about
CLA Schwab every single
day he hasn't done anything new has
he
um could a judge or jury be better I
don't
know they'll use more advanced weapons
if they have
them Dave Rubin says it's true well but
did Dave Rubin see the form I mean we're
looking at the same stuff aren't
we
all
right secret
followers oh I I guess there's a the
clips of me with Russell Brand just
dropped the first clip might be more
than one clip but if you want to see me
uh talking to Russell Brand I guess that
just just
dropped forgot the part what
