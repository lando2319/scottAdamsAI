good morning everybody and how lucky we
all are
wow
woke up alive again
how many days in a row have you nailed
it yeah
a lot of people are waking up dead but
not you you're waking up alive and i
respect that
and if you think
today could get any better
and you're thinking to yourself i don't
think it could it's already pretty good
i don't think it could get better it can
it's called the simultaneous sip
it makes everything better
and you're about to experience it if
you're here live if you hear recorded it
still works still works but not quite as
well as live and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker jealousy
steiner canteen jugger flask vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that
makes everything
everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
i'm being asked on youtube if i only
have one sip of coffee per day
that's all i need
this one sip and i'm good for the whole
day
no
coffee is like money
do you know what i learned about money
when i was an economics major
more is better
it's one of the few things you can say
about economics that works every time
money
more
is better
all right
would you like to go deep with me
would you like to go deep
we're gonna do some crazy right now
all right here's where i blow your mind
i did the i tried this out last night
with my private locals channel so
they've seen this i'll give you the
quick version so they don't have to
watch it again
elon musk
what's his big plan
oh i think i figured it out
a little pattern recognition and i put
it all together what are the companies
that elon musk is investing in or owns
artificial intelligence he's into that
big
neural link the thing that reads your
brain waves
electric cars but also electric
batteries
battery is very important to the story
humanoid like robots tesla announced
that they're going to build a robot as a
humanoid
look
see where i'm going yet
mission to mars
see where it is yet
he's going to be the first transhuman
take your new neural link technology
upgraded a few versions and pretty soon
he has mapped his own mind
and he can take his mind map and add it
with the all the interviews he's done in
public
and you can create elon version 2.0 and
put him in a tesla robot
not done yet
not done yet
he isn't just going to be the first
transhuman
he's going to be the first transhuman
augmented by
the most advanced artificial
intelligence in the world
you see it yet
do you know how hard it will be to go to
mars if you have a human body if you're
an organic entity
very hard you might die
how hard would it go how hard would it
be to go to mars if you were a robot
much easier elon musk is going to be the
first transhuman he's going to make his
base on mars and he's going to rule
the galaxy
by using a.i
to take over everything that he hasn't
already taken over
that's right
elon musk
has an actual
functional plan
to become the robot lord of the universe
and i don't think anything can stop him
and by the way i'm completely serious
there's there's not a bit of sarcasm or
humor in this
i mean it's funny sounding
but look at the assets he's compiled
he literally has found a way to beat
death
in a sense
because his robot can just keep
continuing and it can get upgraded
because it'll probably have a trust fund
to fund it forever so he can get new
parts get new ai upgrade
until he's the most powerful
entity in the universe and might still
control his entire fortune
because i don't think there's anything
that stops a robot from controlling a
trust fund if the trust is set up that
way might need a human to you know
co-sign for the robot or something but
basically you could do it
so
the richest person in the universe has
found a way to beat death
and also rule the universe from his
robotic
entity in the future
just thought i'd throw that in there so
you know what's ahead
you want another twist
oh i'm not done
here's the final twist
if you think that my vision of what he's
putting together is possible oh and by
the way
throw in
starlink his
satellite network
so that his robot will be able to have
instant communication around the world
without the interference of the
government
because the government could shut down
the internet
but they can't shut down starlink
you will have the only unshuttable
network
in existence
and he will own it
or his robot self will
yeah his low latency uh satellite
network
but here's the here's the real mind
effort you know that eli musk believes
in the simulation right
that we almost certainly
are a simulated world and not a real one
and the funny thing about a simulation
is if there's even one
there's almost certainly lots of them
because you wouldn't make just one
right and even the simulation itself
would create sub simulations if it were
a good simulation it would invent its
own simulations and so on and so on
turtles all the way down
now put those two ideas together
the if the simulation is is what reality
is
and the the numbers strongly suggest it
is
and elon believes it's true
and if it's possible in our simulation
to create an elon musk robot that looks
just like elon musk and acts like him
there's a billion to one chance
he's already that robot
that's all
that's all
there's a billion to one chance
he's already the robot
all right that's just for fun here's
also for fun
i saw a tweet by paul collider talking
about a
person who has invented a solution to
basically everything
okay i might be exaggerating a little
bit
but i think he made a solution to
everything
now i had a similar idea but mine wasn't
nearly as good
does anybody remember me talking about
heat chimneys
as a way to create energy while
scrubbing co2
does anybody remember me saying that
now the way a heat chimney works is you
would build let's say a mile high
chimney
and you would find that the hot air
would go into the bottom of the chimney
and it would rise very quickly
especially if you know you've heated the
top of the chimney with the sun let's
say
so
because hot warm air rises right so at
the top of the chimney would be cold air
at the bottom coming in would be the
warm air so actually you don't need to
heat the top of the chimney it'll the
air will just automatically go up
i think
now
this concept has been uh
far far improved because it turns out if
you have a big enough one of these
let's say you have multiple you know
mile-high chimneys in the same place
they will actually create clouds
now that's something i didn't know
so the the temperature differential
um and i guess the fact that the warm
air is being cooled
releases moisture
so what we what you do is you would end
up creating a
a rainy climate very locally
like super locally
you would have the weather you wanted
so you could create water and nothing
create water out of the air you could
use that to farm in places that you
couldn't farm before let's say a desert
and it would grow a bunch of
plants
that you couldn't grow before
and those plants would capture co2
so you can capture co2 by building these
seed chimneys create water
create electricity
capture co2
and what else does it do and it's good
for growing plants of course i suppose
if you had a greenhouse you'd pump co2
into it
um so it improves power generation
stabilizes planetary temperatures
uh gives you fresh water anywhere
removes co2
and
apparently he's going to compete for the
elon musk x prize the 100 million dollar
prize to scrub co2 out of the
atmosphere now i imagine that somebody
will win that with a different
technology
but
apparently
from an engineering perspective there's
nothing about this that can't be done
isn't that cool
there's nothing about this idea that
can't be done
so this is all pretty much well
understood science you know nothing
nothing has to be invented you just have
to engineer it
all right on a less happy note uh the
nordstrom store that is just down the
road for me in walnut creek california
i was hit by a mob of 50 to 80 people i
think 80 is the official number
who simultaneously had ski masks and
clubs and stuff like that
and ran in and just ransacked nordstrom
and ran out to waiting cars
now
i almost didn't want to talk about this
story
because you don't want to give people
ideas because it totally worked you know
very few people got arrested because
there were just so many of them and
nobody saw it coming
but
i would like to add
this to the simulation
will there ever be one of these flash
mobs of looting a store at exactly the
same time a mass shooter is in the same
place
is the simulation going to serve that up
to us because you have your mass
shooters
that's the thing way too many of them
and i suspect that this mob looting
thing is going to grow
so you can have a bunch of them
can the simulation ever give us a
situation
where the mass shooter is in the same
place as all the looters
two problems that solve themselves
that's all i'm saying
i i don't think it's likely
but it's a non-zero chance
that the mass shooter will kill all the
looters
and the police will just have to go
there and take the bodies away so it
could be a self
a self
correcting problem
if we get enough mass shooters
they will cancel out the mass looting
so that's the optimistic take
i like to look on the optimistic side
well bill maher continues to make news
every single friday i guess his show is
going to go on hiatus for the winter so
it won't be as much
but
uh he is hammering the democrats like
nobody's ever hammered him
i don't think the right
has ever laid a po you know laid a glove
on on the left because everybody just
stays in their bubble
but when the when the left is being
pummeled by someone who's inside their
bubble
i think it hurts a little more
and he's talking about how the democrats
are completely out of touch with america
especially white
non-college educated in america and he
went pretty hard at it
and i ask you this
why can bill maher see this so clearly
i mean everything he's saying about
about his team
is just 100 accurate there's just
nothing to argue with
why can he see it
and the others can't
tell me why you know about human nature
and tell me why he can see it
but but his party can't
somebody says ratings let's follow the
money
but i don't think he's doing it for
ratings because he would do better on
ratings
if he just stuck with the team
the best way you can do ratings is to
stick with the team so he's actually
going against his money interests
i think his crowds actually have shifted
now he has more conservatives but i
don't think he did it for the money
because that would have been
a dumb play like nobody would have
thought that would have worked and i
don't know if it is working
he likes conflict no
no that's not it i mean he might but
mindset
marijuana that's not a bad guess
experience
human voter he understands human
motivation
yeah there's some of that for sure well
i think i think part of it is because
he's tried to um
he's tried to put himself in the middle
of topics
meaning that to try to try to see both
sides
here's my take
i think that he's yeah maybe mushrooms
mushrooms might be part of the story
but i think bill maher
has trained himself to see both sides
that's it i think it's a skill
i think it's a learned skill probably
you have to be born with you know a
little bit of a certain kind of mind it
probably does help if he had ever
experimented with psychedelics it
probably did help
to get you out of your box but i think
it's a learned skill
i think by not being slavishly on one
side of every topic
his brain is just now
optimized to be able to see what other
people can't see
now by the way that's a real thing
it's called reticular activation
you know you know that uh
effect where you can hear your name in a
crowded room but you can't pick out any
other words
you know the background noise will be
remember
scott
you'll be like
what the only thing i heard out of all
that rubble was my name clearly
what's up with that it's because your
brain can tune itself
to notice things
if you practice
in fact you can actually practice
noticing opportunity this is a real
thing it's been studied if you just tell
yourself you have good luck and that
you're optimistic everything's going to
work out for you
it changes your actual field of view
and you could actually not feel the view
about your perception you actually see
opportunities that you wouldn't have
seen before
because you can tune your brain
to spot things
um
here's an example from my own life
as a
older teenager i once found twenty
dollars on the ground
and
that was a lot of money when i was a
teenager that would be more like a
hundred dollars today right
so if you imagine a kid finding
something the equivalent of a hundred
dollars laying on the ground
it causes you to look at the ground a
lot
so i somehow became trained
to expect money
on the ground
do you know how many times i've found
actually cash money
like paper money
on the ground
a lot
i don't know how many times all of you
have found actual money on the ground
but i've probably done it 30 times
cash money
like lots of dollar bills just laying on
the ground next to the road
and it would be a road where lots of
other people have walked
and
for some reason i found it and other
people didn't see it
a lot of a lot of you saying the same so
my hypothesis is that you can train your
brain to see things that other people
don't see
will you accept that
will you accept the premise that a
person can train their brain
to notice things
that you wouldn't otherwise notice
i think that's fair right
and i think that somebody like bill
maher
who makes it his career
to at least understand the argument on
both sides i believe he's trained his
brain so he can see it that's all i
think it's as simple as that
all right um
msnbc appears to be
sort of a mental health crisis
masquerading as a news organization
and i say that in all seriousness
because the
that
um i guess the tone and the
guests and everything about msnbc and by
the way i don't really see this on cnn
if you watch cnn it looks like
you have angry partisans
who are just taking a side
but when you watch msnbc it doesn't look
exactly like that does it
it cnn is mostly just side taking and
then just people say whatever whatever
the
you know the narrative is on their side
they just repeat it but on msnbc it
actually looks like a mental health
crisis and i'm not i'm not kidding even
a little bit all right i'm going to be
completely serious
it looks like
a mental health crisis and i'll give you
even the specific mental health problem
it looks like uh vulnerable narcissists
or toxic narcissists you know there are
other names for it
what are some of the things you would
expect from an individual who's a
vulnerable narcissist
let's say you catch them in uh being
wrong
you find out that they have a fact wrong
or you call them out in a lie how does a
vulnerable narcissist respond
they will attack you personally
right they attack you personally they
don't say well what about your
philosophy they call you a white
supremacist
they call you a racist they call you a
sexist they call you names
so vulnerable narcissists don't address
the argument
they will call you names
who does that
cnn a little bit
but msnbc it's their whole whole gig
is is labeling people as
bad people now what's the other thing
that uh vulnerable narcissists do
far more than the regular public
although i guess we all do it a little
projection
yeah a vulnerable narcissist will rob a
bank
and then accuse the police of being uh
bank robbers
and the police will say um we're
literally police
we literally just caught you walking out
of the bank with a gun and a bag of
money and we've got 15 witnesses
and we're the police
where the police arresting you
the vulnerable narcissist will look
right at him and say
you robbed this bank
you're the bank robber
and and everybody who's watching will
say i don't even know what's going on
here
right
you know somebody like that
you know you know somebody like that
they lie and call you a liar
they're racist and they call you a
racist
now msnbc has gone full overt racist
in fact one of their guests today
um
somebody named cross
uh
called uh again called uh kyle's
kyle rittenhouse a white supremacist
for which there's no evidence whatsoever
and all the evidence which is to suggest
he's not
but on msnbc you can actually go full
racist and nobody makes a peep
what
what how is that okay
how's that suddenly okay
all right to me that looks like a mental
health problem but here's the thing that
really came out of uh i'm gonna i'm
gonna
take this in a little bit slightly
different direction
the written house case
tells us the whole problem
i think and i'm gonna go to uh my white
supremacist board it used to be called a
white board
but i've been watching a lot of msnbc
and i realized that if you call it a
whiteboard you're just buying him to
white supremacy so i'm just gonna call
it a white supremacist whiteboard
so msnbc has something to talk about
um
i could call the blackboard because as
you know i identify as black
oh let me do that
since i identify as black i'll just call
it blackboard because it's my board
it's not your board it's my board it's a
blackboard all right so we'll go to the
blackboard
and i'll tell you what i think is the
whole problem
in the rittenhouse case
the most weird the most bizarre thing
happened that i'll bet all of you saw
this
how many of you saw somebody on the left
say something like this
if ridden house
had been black
what would have happened
how many of you saw somebody say
something like that if ridden house had
been black
what would happen
and what what did your brain do when you
heard that
didn't your brain just explode and say
oh what
what
i
what is wrong with you right that was
your first your first impression was
probably
what the hell is wrong with you
why on earth would the race of the
people involved make any difference
like how is this racial it's a whole
bunch of white guys
how in the world did this become a
racial question
and by the way
if a black man had done exactly what
kyle rittenhouse would do
what would the right be asking
when can we vote for him
am i right
that's what the right would be asking if
exactly the same thing but the written
house had been black they would say when
is he going to run for office i want to
vote for that guy
now if you're on the left
you don't get that at all do you
i don't think there's anybody on the
left who understands that even a little
bit why why don't they understand that
i will tell you
watch this this is going to blow your
mind
now i'm going to bring together some
things i've said before in different
ways but when i bring this together i
think this is going to blow your
freaking mind watch this
now that i've oversold it
totally
here's what i see
from the left and the right
what i see
is that the left
has one filter they have one filter on
life which is grievance
their world view is that
whatever their situation is is caused by
other people who did better
sometimes they did better because
they're terrible racists and they had
slaves whatever but sometimes they just
did better
for a variety of reasons but the the
left only has one filter
what happens to you if you only have one
filter
well things don't go well
things don't go well at all because life
is somewhat subjective
meaning there's not the one preferred
way to look at everything and you're
done
rather you need a variety of filters
for a variety of situations
i would argue that on the right they
have a variety of filters there's your
constitution
and depending on the topic you're
talking about they might be talking
about the first amendment the second
amendment
might talk about the court systems but
basically they have a systems view well
we've got a system that takes care of
this stuff
they also have a bible filter
which is also a system
the bible is a system
it says if you act in this way every day
or as much as you can
you you get a payoff in the end right
bible is a system constitution is a
system
small government
is a system
small government is a system because
every day you have to work at keeping it
small
you want to raise my taxes no
you want to create a new department no
right you have to work at it every day
to keep it from growing that's a system
and the system says if you can keep it
small by working at it really hard
getting your republicans in office etc
whatever it takes then you get better
results
now we don't know the specific result
but overall if you use these three
systems
you get good results on average very
imperfect
very imperfect right systems are
imperfect
but the best we have
and then also family is another system
family isn't a goal
it's a system
that for many people works very well
especially if you combine it with the
bible filter
the bible plus a family
two good systems that work together
pretty well now i remind you that i'm
not personally a believer
but it's obvious that as a system
religion works very well with family
in fact i wish i had that
ability to believe because i think it's
an advantage in life
i just don't have it
now i'm going to take it to the next
level
so the first level is that on the right
people have several filters to look
through and they can change out their
filters as they need to oh this is a
bible filter this is a family filter
this is a government filter this is the
constitution
so when when the kyle rittenhouse case
comes out
what do the people on the right do
they change their filter
to the one that makes sense
they they change their filter to the one
that fits the situation
the the second amendment
and they say
um
self-defense
okay we're done here that's it
i put my filter on it
we have clear evidence of self-defense
with firearms
nothing to see here it's done
the filter the filter got the same
answer as the court system
right
so nobody on the right was confused
when the courts
agreed with them
that their second amendment filter on
this was accurate
now imagine how lost you would be
if you only had one way to look at the
world a grievance filter
and you have a situation that has no
race in it whatsoever
but you only have this
that's all you have just one filter
you've heard the old saying if all you
have is a hammer everything looks like a
nail
that's the problem
the problem is
that the msnbcs and the cnns of the
world
have hammered this one filter so much
that they only have one
they don't have the ability to do what
conservatives do naturally which is to
move back and forth to the filter that
makes sense
now if you think all these filters are
really just the same filter
they're not
let me give you an example what happens
when your government filter
conflicts with your family filter
trouble right
big trouble big big trouble all right so
these filters don't always work together
but in a situation like the rittenhouse
case
it's a it's a perfect system just put it
through the filter boom you predicted
now what do i tell you about
your filters
are some so are some filters true
like they really nail reality and some
less true
is that what i say about filters
no
no filters are not about reality
because we don't have brains that can
see reality
never have
never will
i don't have one you don't have one
einstein didn't have one our brains did
never they never evolved
for us to clearly see reality or not
even close
so we all have this little movie that's
playing in their head
so what do i say about filters
how do you know you have a good one
how do you know you have a good filter
what's the one and only way
you know it's good
exactly
prediction
if your filter accurately predicts
then keep it
and keep it if it stops predicting
get rid of it
and that's it
forget about what is true and what is
false because you can't tell
but you can tell if it predicted
now whose filter predicted kyle
rittenhouse would get off
constitution filter predicted to that
and it predicted it with certainty
am i right i mean you were worried
but it was a pretty clean prediction i
think and what did the people on the
left say
what happened
how could this be
because their filter doesn't predict
am i right
so
if you join late
the reason that the left and the right
can't see the same things
is because the right uses different
filters on reality
and they use the ones that predict the
best let's take this one small
government does that predict well
yeah
yeah it predicts that if you add a new
bureaucracy you'll eventually come to
regret it
how often is that filter right
a lot
that's really predictive right
so the grievance filter unfortunately um
can work sometimes
oh let me let me be completely clear
about this
this filter can predict sometimes
but not all the time
and if you don't have the ability to
switch to other filters
you will be you'll be blinded by your
one filter
all you have is a hammer everything
looks like a nail and that's really what
you're seeing
uh on the left
with the number of people who said
you know hey if if ridden house had been
black
that was like the uh
the rosetta stone
the the written house case was like the
rosetta stone i love making this
reference because only 20 percent of you
even know what it means but 20 percent
of you just said yeah i get that
the other 80 said stop using references
i don't understand
but
i don't even know that rosetta stone
story but there was some stone
that had some code on it that if you had
that one stone with that little written
code on it you could decipher this other
language that you couldn't
get your hands on otherwise
you couldn't figure out the code until
you got this one rock
so the rosetta stone is the thing that
opened up the code
and i think the written house case
opened up the code
so that you can see this clearly
because before the written house case
it wasn't this clear right when you
watch people
who see clear self-defense and they only
see race and it's all white people
that's the rosetta stone
now you know what's going on everything
is explained by these filters
right
all right
uh
smurkanish has an interesting theory
which i agree with 100 percent now i've
told you before and i'll say it again
um while i criticize cnn
almost non-stop
they do also employ this fellow named
smurkanish
who
is closer to reasonable than just about
anybody they've ever had on their
network
now he's had me on his show a number of
times
twice three times
different shows
and
and what what better uh you know
what better evidence do you need that
he's willing to hear both sides right so
murkonish is kind of a bill maher
personality as far as i can tell from
the outside can't read anybody's minds
but he looks like somebody who can see
the argument on both sides
so give him a follow if you don't follow
him i he's he's worthy there are some
people on the left you just have to
follow
van jones
you should follow van jones even if you
don't agree with them and some are
connish
because
those are two people who can at least
see the argument on both sides
and that's that's worth a lot
so here's his theory about why biden is
so unpopular at the moment aside from
performance itself
trump is not in the news
so you don't have a uh you don't have a
contrast
biden is not being compared to anybody
right now
oh how do you smell it spell it how do
you smell it
uh smirk on us is s-m-e-r-c-o-n-i-s-h
is it first name michael uh he never
uses his first name it seems like
i don't even know his first name he
seems to use his last name all the time
um
anyway i agree with that i i think i
think smirkonish is uh is absolutely
right that the longer trump
uh stays out of the news the more
popular he'll get it is michael it's
michael smerganisch
and i 100 agree with that trump could
become president again
by simply
making let's say
ordinary comments about the news
instead of trump comments you know that
a trump comment always goes too far
which is sort of his signature
his signature move is to go too far
because that's what makes it exciting
that's what makes you look at it
that's what draws your attention that's
what controls the energy
right
so at least one of one part of it is
that trump is not there to create the uh
the hated alternative to biden
um now that's not the only reason right
yeah provocative when i say goes too far
you could say provocative that would be
another way to say it
i saw this uh
uh tweet by uh by mike cernovich
the other day
that i i swear to god i just read that
thing over and over again because it was
just so beautiful
it was beautifully provocative
now i didn't i didn't quite you know
agree with all the content in it it was
a it was an opinion piece
but man
can
concern of its right provocative tweets
like you can't look away it's like ah i
want to agree with it but i can't but i
want to
goes too far
you know that's just a perfect tweet and
uh and trump has that same skill
um
if we were to create if somebody created
a news channel there was 100 real news
as if you could really do that but but
they tried really hard to make it
unbiased
who would watch it
not many people is the answer
and there's a reason for that because
real news isn't that interesting
it's only the fake news that gets us
interested
it's the fake stuff that we care about
now
of course we we learned that the hard
way through social medias algorithms
and we discovered that if it fed us up
more fake news we clicked on it more
so of course we got into this situation
uh honestly i guess
and
uh but here i'm here to tell you that
every once in a while you hear this hey
if somebody
invents a network with real news think
of how popular that will be no
nobody's going to watch it
let me give you an analogy because you
like those right they're so convincing
analogies
all right here's one
if somebody invents a healthy food
everybody will stop eating the bad stuff
you know if it tastes good
but if somebody makes some healthy food
that tastes pretty good
and obesity is done
no
no because people like unhealthy food
the same way they like fake news
junk food and fake news are basically
just the same
stimulus
it's just that's not good for you
but
sure feels fun
while it's happening
so forget about your unbiased news
you'll never see that
uh meanwhile the the fbi has turned
against the country uh and against the
citizens and i think we can just say
that directly at this point the fbi is
no longer on the side of the of the
citizens of the united states
i think maybe it used to be
or maybe we just didn't know how bad it
was but at this point i think the news
is is painting us a pretty clear picture
of the fbi being a
a corrupt organization that probably
needs to be um
you know
it needs to be dismantled and put back
together i think there's something wrong
with it deeply
now at the moment it's uh
i guess it did a raid on a on a school
board activist named shirona bishop
imagine an fbi
breaking down the door
of somebody who's just a citizen who's
just an activist on the school boards
and i guess she's helped flip nine local
school boards
i don't know what flipped means but does
that mean get new people in there or
something or to get them to
i don't know whatever she's doing to
flip them
but can you can you imagine any scenario
in which it makes sense for the fbi to
break down the door of a mother a mom
a mom
who is just an activist about
what's good for her kids
and by the way
nobody is accusing her of a crime that i
know of
is she even accused of a crime
i didn't see that in the story there
must have been something she was accused
of
was it taxes
what what oh supposedly wire fraud
and it was the wire fraud supposedly
about taxes to or not paying them or
whatever
they coughed her
are you kidding me
they cuffed her
in front of her kids
did they cuff a mother in front
of her kids for a
suspicion of a white-collar crime i
suppose they have to do that but
i sure hope not
god
you know
um
the fbi does seem purely political at
this point
and even if they had a good reason for
this you know we could learn out later
we could learn later they had a good
reason but
they don't they earn our trust
so this is still we're still in the fog
of war on the story so if tomorrow it
turns out that she was a you horrible
terrorist or something and the fbi had
good information about it or whatever
so if it turns out tomorrow that the fbi
was just right
to do this i can't see how but you could
be surprised
mother covers
those mother covers
nice
nicely done
mother cuffers
um
mother cuffers
now i'm just going to be thinking about
that all day because that's too good
all right
uh anyway the fbi we don't trust them so
if we hear a story that could go either
way and i think this is one of those
stories that could probably go either
way you know you could easily imagine
that tomorrow we'll learn something that
supports the fbi's action
but maybe not
and i'm saying that if there's a benefit
of a doubt they don't they don't earn it
anymore
i think the court system
still deserves the benefit of a doubt
you could disagree with that but i think
our core system is good enough i give
them the benefit of a doubt when i'm not
sure exactly why they did what they did
usually i think they usually get it
right but the fbi has lost the benefit
of a doubt am i right has the fbi
forfeited the benefit of a doubt
when i hear his bad story about the fbi
i'm going to automatically assume it's
probably true from now on
and i would have maybe automatically
assumed it was not true in the past
yeah i think they've lost the
presumption of innocence
i mean if individuals of course still
have the presumption of innocence but as
an organization they have lost the
presumption of innocence
that's pretty bad
all right
um you know
i turned on the news and it's just one
topic that they can't stop talking about
which is why joe biden did not release
his cognitive test results or did he
have one
you know have you seen any other news
today it's like all over the headlines
oh no it isn't
i'm the only one talking about it
it's not in any headline anywhere
now i'm not the guy who usually does the
well what if this was trump because that
just bores the hell enemy it's too easy
whenever you do the if this were trump
you know i mean
often there's a point to be made in that
but it's so easy and so common that i
hate to say it
but if this had been trump
sometimes you just have to say it if
this had been trump it would have been
the only headline
where is his cognitive test where is his
cognitive test and
of course trump passed
i mean that's what we hear
and and biden is obviously degraded
obviously to everybody there's nobody
who doesn't see it
right and we're not even talking about
we're not even talking about a cognitive
test
we are so brainwashed
you you see it really clearly in a case
like this and it's not because trump
would have been treated differently you
could take trump completely out of the
story
where's his cognitive test he's
obviously cognitively
challenged
or at least cognitively at risk
right
and so you don't need trump of the story
to say what the hell is going on
all
right apparently uh kenosha didn't have
uh anything that looked like a protest
um people gathered but they they seemed
to have talked it out or something
and i'd said before
uh before the verdict that it looked
like low energy in kenosha
and uh martin cohen
said in a tweet and
i
i'm leaning in this direction i it might
be an overstatement but i'm leaning in
the following direction to agree with
martin who says martin says that he
predicted no protests after the
riddenhauser thing because the original
protests meaning the protests which
ritenhauser written house had attended
originally had the goal of defeating the
president
and now that trump is out no more
protests for a while
i hate to say that feels right
am i right
because there's nothing that happened
that would have changed the protests
from
then to now
do you remember the
wall street
protests about
what was it income inequality
and those protests just went away
did our income inequality get fixed
no
the protests were never real
the protests were never real they were
yeah occupy wall street exactly the
occupy wall street now we know
never was about a topic it must have
been some political thing
now we know that blm is mostly some kind
of political instrument
and has nothing to do with their issues
now i'm overstating it right there are
plenty of people who say they're part of
blm who do care about the issues
including me
because actually i think blm's issues
are good issues
you know
there's a whole separate question of how
they're going about it but in terms of
are the police treating minority people
worse
i don't know
because i don't really have a window
into that but if 30 or whatever of your
country
thinks that the police are
discriminating against certain types of
people i'm going to take that really
seriously
whatever it is
right because if i were in that 30 i'd
want you to take it seriously
even if i were wrong
even if it was just in my mind even if i
were bringing it upon myself by the way
i act when police come i'd still want
you to be looking into this as a fellow
citizen
which sounds sexist fellow
right
somebody says i'm in the 30 percent
yeah i mean i identify as black but
since the police won't know that
i think i would i would be able to get
off
all right anyway so i think protests you
have to see as fake
uh really from this point on i would say
any protest you see on the left
that doesn't have support on the right
you know let's say if we're protesting a
war
some new war you can see that that would
be a valid protest
but
so far the ones we've seen most recently
are apparently all fake protests that
doesn't mean that the individuals
aren't real
let me let me be as clear as possible i
think the individuals
probably had legitimate
you know grievances and wanted to
protest about it
but the reason that they showed up at
all
was because somebody was pulling the
strings
right you can have grievances about a
lot of stuff and not protest
i got plenty of grievances i didn't
protest at all today but the thing that
activates people to hit the streets is
obviously coming from some source i
don't know what source
you think it's george soros i don't
think so but
can't rule anything out
i saw a graph today adam dopamine uh
tweeted around
and
it seemed to show that vaccinations uh
you know help
but not a lot
that's what the the data showed
it showed that yeah it does protect you
from hospitalization and stuff
but not a ton
you know it's like maybe twice as good
where we thought it was eight times as
good or something like that
but it took about a minute and a half
for uh
andre's backhouse to debunk it
apparently it's been debunked before so
if you see that graph it's a fake graph
it's taken out of context blah blah blah
read the footnotes
so if you see any graph on the internet
what is your first reaction to it
if you see data about vaccinations
doesn't matter what the data says and
it's on twitter
what should be your first response
seriously unlikely to be true
if i had put a percentage on it i would
say that any data on vaccinations that
you see on twitter
90 to 95 fake
at least the odds of it i'm not saying
all of it is 95 fake i'm saying if
there's a new
graph or finding or data about
vaccinations or masks
or shutdowns or anything about the
pandemic
and it's on social media
90 to 95 chance is false and by the way
same percentage if it comes from the
government
i'm not going to change that
depending on the source
i don't care about the source
cdc fda
pfizer doesn't matter the source if it's
about the pandemic just assume there's
about 90 95 chance it's not true
and you'll be in good shape
okay
so that
is my show for the day
i don't know what the other live
streamers are doing but they're not
talking about elon musk's transhumanism
galactic conquest
and i don't think anybody's talking to
you about why the left doesn't have
enough filters
to understand reality
is alex berenson in the five percent i'm
being asked
uh alex berenson as far as i know has
i've never seen him be right with any
data
that doesn't mean he's never had any
data that's correct i'll just say that
i've never seen anything from him that
wasn't obviously wrong
and got debunked within minutes of
hitting the internet now your your
mileage might differ maybe you're seeing
different stuff now and let me be clear
i'm pro alex berenson
which might surprise you
because you need some of him
and lots of them actually in a situation
like this
because you don't want to just blindly
say oh data science okay let's do it
you need somebody like him who's pushing
on everything i mean he's basically
pushing back on everything that comes
out about the pandemic
how often is he going to be right when
he says that the government is wrong
how often is he going to be correct
a lot
a lot right if all you did is say the
government's lying
and then you waited how often would you
be right
a lot
a lot right so saying that the
government's data and numbers and
promises are
 you need an l experience and
lots of them
because a lot of it is and you
need people out there who have a public
platform to warn the public
now
but the second part of that is when alex
berenson is creating or boosting his own
data
i don't think he creates it but he's
finding data somewhere that's not from
the government
and then he boosts it
when he does that he's wrong almost
every time
because not only is the government
producing numbers that are
but so is everybody else
there's nobody who's giving you good
data
so it doesn't matter if it's alex
berenson or anybody else fauci doesn't
matter whoever's showing you data
is misleading you because it's almost
never right
and you don't know i mean five percent
of it might be right
but you don't know which five percent
now i do think
that you might be able to find like big
trends
so i still think it's very likely that
the vaccinations help
that's my current view subject to change
and like bill maher i have trained
myself
that i can get out of my bubble if i
need to
meaning that if the weight of
information starts moving the other way
i'll just change my mind and then i'll
say huh
you know i took a guess
because we're all guessing
we're all guessing if you think the
vaccination is a bad idea for you
specifically
you could be right
and you could be wrong
but the only thing i know for sure is
you're guessing
it's not about data because we don't
have any reliable data about anything
so i could easily change my mind to oh
it was a big mistake i wish i hadn't
gotten those vaccinations easily easily
so if you think i'm locked in to a pro
vaccination stand i never have been
never have been i'm always open
to even obvious things
that everybody says is true
being not true
because it happens a lot
um
does rfk junior have the voice problem i
had i don't think so i think he has a
different problem
i looked into a little bit and it
doesn't sound like they call his problem
the same as my problem
all right
uh how bou is doing well
okay anyway
20 beds of mostly vaccinated coughing
people
so here are some other things
that you should ignore
the number of vaccinated people who are
catching it
almost all the data on that is is out of
context or fake data
let me say it again
percent of any data you see about
vaccinated people
getting infected
i wouldn't trust any of it
right it might be true
but i don't think you can trust it
i i think all the data is out of context
poorly organized poorly presented
willfully misinterpreted that's the
world we're in
uh just look at israel data no
no
no no no
no and no and no and somebody on here is
going to say well then just look at
sweden no
no no no no no
don't look at sweden you will learn
nothing
because why
you can't trust any of the data
look at israel do you trust the data
no
do you know why you shouldn't trust data
coming out of israel
is it because i'm anti-semitic no
i'm not
is it because it's coming from israel no
no
it's because it's data
and it's about the pandemic and you
can't trust any of it
but if every country is coming to the
same conclusion with all their data
doing it different ways
then in a way you can do a poor man's
meta-analysis and say well
basically
every major country says these
vaccinations are worth it
that doesn't mean they
are but at least it's sort of a poor
man's meta-analysis that everything
seems to be pointing in the same
direction
take for example the fake news always
whenever it's wrong
is wrong against conservatives
again that's not a coincidence
right so you could you could not know
anything about any individual story
that's fake news and be uncertain
whether it's true or not but you can
certainly see the big picture
that if it's fake
it's going to be
bad for conservatives basically
all right
you the uninformed parole aren't
qualified to research or analyze your
facts as scott is though
so somebody on locals is saying that i'm
saying that i think they're
characterizing me as saying that i'm
qualified to look into stuff and
research it but you're not is that what
you're hearing
is anybody else hearing that does
anybody hear me say that oh no
unlike you i can tell when the data is
accurate
no
it's exactly the opposite
if there's anything i can tell you
clearly is i can't tell what's real
if you think you can
you're up
all right
you're up if you think you can
read any of this pandemic data and know
what's true and what isn't
you're just up
all right
which is not to say that you won't give
some right you will get some right by
chance
uh you're dismissive of the data as an
average correct i'm dismissive of the
data on average
crowder made a good point obvious but
scared people are controllable people
yeah
scared people are controllable people
um have you seen what's happening in
gibraltar no
oh
oh you paid ten dollars to tell me that
i should look at data and believe
it really
are you hearing anything i'm saying
you paid ten dollars
and you thought you would convince me
with your one anecdote about one country
that probably has bad data
and gibraltar
here's what you should take away from
the gibraltar so gibraltar is almost all
vaccinated and they're still having
problems here's what you should take
away from the
gibraltar data
nothing
the moment you think there's some data
that agrees with you is right you're
lost
none of it is believable some of it is
right
but none of it is credible so the moment
you say some of this data is credible
you you're into dream world you're just
hallucinating because none of it is
all right
and
by far it's the exceptions that are the
least believable so of all the data
that's not believable
if any of it is the exception that is
the least believable of an unbelievable
bunch
so anything you want to say about sweden
is unbelievable
anything about israel unbelievable extra
unbelievable and anything about
gibraltar is extra unbelievable
so your examples are the most
unbelievable
of a category which is unbelievable by
its nature
all right
uh well do you think the vax rate data
is wrong or the case state rate data is
wrong so robin is asking me what
specifically i think is wrong with the
data in gibraltar
it's data
i don't know how i can make this more
clear
see maybe i can maybe i can do it on the
whiteboard
because i
for some reason i'm having trouble
communicating this concept
oh let me get rid of this
i think this was an idea that i
decided not to do
too controversial
all right
so i'm going to try to clarify this
point
can you all see me all right
so if it's data
if it's data
it's equal to
now this is going to be an equation
so you're not all going to be
able to follow the math
so if it's data
it's equal to
a big pile
of steaming
and i'll put some flies around here
because i don't want you to be confused
there's some flies
right steaming right here
now i didn't draw the cow but
now you can use this filter to answer a
lot of your specific questions and let
me let me do that for you
scott
what do you think about the data from
gibraltar
let me see
well let me run it through the filter
it's data
so it's equal to
steaming pile of
so the the gibraltar data is unreliable
uh what about israel good point i got a
good point here what about the data from
israel
well let's run it through the filter
see what comes out
it's data
so it's uh equal to
steaming pile of
steaming pile of
now let's do one more because i don't i
know some of you are not following yet
what about the data from sweden
sweden
well it's data it's equal to
now if anybody didn't understand
the algorithm
there might be somebody in your circle
who can explain it to you better
[Laughter]
all right well maybe i made my point but
i know somebody on here is still going
to ask me but what about this data but
what about the cdc
all right that's all i got for today
and i will talk to you
maybe later today
or maybe tomorrow
as i don't understand in which data of
israel is bs the vaccination data or the
infection rate
should i answer this question
let me answer this question it says i
don't understand which data in israel is
the bs are you talking about the
vaccination rate or the infection rate
well let's let's run it through the
filter
we'll see the vaccination rate
well that's that's data
and then that would be equal to if i'm
doing this right
steaming pile of
okay that's that was the
that's the vaccination rate but if we
looked at the infection rate
which is completely different
so let's run that through the filter too
so that would be a data
and then how does this work again
can somebody remind me how this
algorithm works
it's a oh i got it i got it i got it's
data so it's equal steaming pile of
now i'll i'll read your comments to see
if there anybody else who has any uh any
more questions
okay
okay you know i think
i think we're getting very close to
making the point
very close
all right
that's all for today i'll talk to you
tomorrow
