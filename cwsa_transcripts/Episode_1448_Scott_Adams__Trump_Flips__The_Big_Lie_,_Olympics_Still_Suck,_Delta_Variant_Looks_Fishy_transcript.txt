well good morning
welcome
to one of the best
episodes of coffee with scott adams of
all time
everywhere in every
time zone every
every ethnicity every age every every
kind of person i think you'll all agree
one hundred percent unanimous
yeah all of us agree
best whatever and all you need to make
it extra special is a copper mug or a
classic tanker chelsea steiner canteen
jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it does it really does
and
it's called the subutania sip
and your comments are funny
and it happens now go
you know it's amazing every time
let me adjust something here and
we'll be in good shape
all right
so uh there's
lots of big news let's let's talk about
some of it
how about that
good idea i think
all right number one
um
there's some breaking news from the san
diego zoo
there's a as you know coved
coved can sometimes infect animals
and it turns out that
a leopard
at the san diego zoo
with coven
has been spotted
i'll just leave that there it's just a
leopard has been spotted
moving on
uh it turns out that team usa won no
medals on opening day for the first time
in 49 years
so the olympic team
uh not too impressive no wins on the
first day
now
if you're looking for a reason
why that happened
it's also the first olympics that our
athletes have ever been kneeling
i don't know do you think that there's a
correlation
that when your athletes who are trying
to be in a winning head
get on their knees before the
competition
that maybe that doesn't put them in the
right frame of mind
could it be
that
the athletes don't have the support sort
of the moral
psychological support of their
of their country
because
they kind of don't
i mean not like they used to
think about the last few years
and what athletes as a class
have done for their brand
you got your lebron
being a big old idiot
you know destroying the brand
you've got your tiger woods
doing some dumbass stuff
you know pick an example
you've got your colin kaepernicks why
support in terms of his his protests etc
but he's not very popular with a lot of
the country so he's not helping the
brand too much
about megan ripano how about alex
rodriguez i mean he's retired but we
still hear about him
doesn't it seem to you
that when there's news about an athlete
it's that they're kneeling and
disrespecting the country saying
something dumb politics driving their
car into the woods
or what
you know the the entire relationship
that america has with its athletes
has changed from oh these are our
special people look how awesome they are
to
what the hell is wrong with these people
so you've got a bunch of athletes that
we just simply don't care about the same
way we did even a year ago
it's just a fact
isn't it well i don't have
any science to back that up
but don't you feel like
we don't respect our athletes anymore
and i feel it's so it's because they
stopped respecting the country
at least the same way
and so should we be surprised that our
athletes that are not fully supported by
the public they represent
are not exceeding you know they're not
excelling
i don't know i think there's a
psychological element to this
that can't be ignored
um
and you know today we're more likely to
think of athletes as just
you know it wasn't long ago that i if
you said oh this famous athlete you
would just automatically have a good
opinion of them
but if you say professional athlete did
whatever in 2021
at least part of your brain is thinking
that's probably an
there's so many now that are
that are athletes yeah probably just an
so olympics are what they used to be
but they might be funnier
or here's the funniest thing from the
olympics
the south korean uh
i guess they're broadcasting in south
korea like they are around the world the
olympics are
the south korean
tv
was putting an image up
for each of the countries as they were
being introduced
uh but
let's just say they didn't think that
through as
as completely as they could have
so some of the
some of the images
that they put in the air for the
different countries is when italy came
up they put an image of pizza
up that's it
that's all you need to know about italy
pizza
but that's not the funny one
when romanian athletes came out
they put out a picture of dracula
so the south koreans
decided that the one image that sums up
romania
is cow dracula
and the one image of the sums up
italy is just just pizza
that's it it's just pizza
i think sweden was a flayed fish or
something
so i guess they had to apologize
that's funny
all right here's the other
uh loser story from the olympics
i i think i'm watching the olympics for
all the wrong reasons
i'm just looking for all the funny
so here's another one
okay this is
this is tragic for the person it
happened to
uh if it seems that i'm laughing at
somebody else's tragedy
well you're not wrong because i will be
laughing at somebody's tragedy in a
moment
but
so dutch cyclist uh anamiyek van vluten
threw her arms up in the air i think
this might have been uh was it on cnn
she was very happy when she crossed the
finish line first in her cycling
competition
and she threw her arms up in the air and
celebrated her first place win
imagine that
practicing all your life all that hard
work you get to the olympics you cross
the finish line first throw up your arms
greatest moment of your life
except that wasn't the finish line and
when she paused to celebrate what wasn't
the finish line
apparently some other cyclists kind of
went past her
and
she lost
and the only reason she lost
is because she celebrated winning before
she got to the finish line otherwise she
would have won i got the gold medal
now
i believe
that it is pure cruelty
to have an olympic event that people
practice for all their life
put all of their
their future their hopes and their
dreams into it it just happens once and
only one person can get to go with the
gold
basically
uh you're creating a situation where
everybody turns into a disappointed
loser except for one person and in this
case it was by luck
the person who won the gold just got
lucky because the other person messed up
and celebrated too early
so we're celebrating we're making people
work their entire you know early lives
to get ready for this event that has no
meaning we don't really care about it
and if something like this happens
they've wasted their whole life
if you got coronavirus
right before the olympics and you had
trained your whole life for it it was
just a waste of time
you got nothing
and to me
teaching children um
to prepare all their life for something
where you've got exactly one shot
usually sometimes you can come back for
another olympic but lots of cases you've
got one shot you can practice all your
life for that
and then it doesn't work out it's a
terrible strategy
now it does make sense to practice for
let's say a professional sport
because you can lose lots of games and
still win the championship
so it's not like one one situation is
your whole deal but olympics just a
terrible model for something
well here's another story that uh this
is literally the headline on fox news
duncan robinson disappointed that he
wasn't chosen as token white guy
replacement for the nba not nba but the
olympics basketball team the american
team
that's the actual headline
duncan robinson disappointed that he
wasn't chosen as token white guy
replacement because the the one white
guy on the team i guess
couldn't make it or something
now they do link to the story in which
the context is given that he was called
a token white guy by i believe a black
sports commentator
jalen ross was it not at rose
i don't watch sports so i don't really
know the all the characters
and
they just report it
they literally just report it like it's
just the fact he's just the token white
guy we sent to the olympics how more
ridiculous can the olympics be
that we're even talking about a headline
about the token white guy we sent
all right that's ridiculous on money on
many levels
um
all right
oh another one
i'm sorry
some of my notes are out of order but
the other thing that the south korean
announcers did is when they showed the
marshall islands
they
they described it as once a nuclear test
site for the u.s
and when ukraine's athletes entered the
south korean announcers
showed an image of the chernobyl
disaster
so ukraine
ukraine just gets a picture of the
chernobyl disaster that's that's their
olympic glory
all right
in the uh in what i'd call the uh what
took so long news
apparently trump at his rally yesterday
uh did his trick
which i thought you knew was going to
come right
remember when he flipped around the
the term fake news
it was used against him and against fox
news by cnn and msnbc and all the lefty
sites
and then trump basically owned it and
made it his and turned fake news into
what his enemies were doing and that's
the way we think of it today it doesn't
even mean anything except
what trump's enemies are saying about
him
and then there was
his same enemies
use this great branding of calling it
the big lie that trump said that the
election was uh
fraudulent
now didn't you know
that eventually trump would turn that
around
as soon as the big lie became a
universal term
sure enough here we go
um he said yesterday at the rally quote
the big lie they call it you know what
is the big lie the opposite was the big
lie the election was the big lie
here we go
now
i'm pretty sure he's going to hammer
that again
it seems unlikely that he's going to do
a one-and-done on that
because it works
it's exactly the right strategy it's
exactly the right
and i would tweak it a little bit
because i'm not comfortable with it the
way it is i was very comfortable with
saying that cnn was fake news so when
trump turned that one around i could i
could fully embrace it
but uh certainly i don't have personally
i don't have access to any any proof
that the election was fraudulent but it
certainly is a big lie that we know it
was
fair
wouldn't you say it's definitely the big
lie
that we know for sure it was fair
because we don't know that the software
part of it is unauditable and therefore
you can't possibly know
so
i think this is the right way to go
although i would have tweaked it and
said that what we don't know and the big
lie is that we know it was fair that's a
little bit cleaner than knowing it was
fraudulent but you know trump's always
going to go for the most provocative
form of the message so i'd expect him to
stay where he's at
um
and i didn't even know that trump did
this until i saw cnn trying to inoculate
against it
so they sent their official uh
troll
stephen collinson who's the
he's the one they hired i think
specifically to say bad things about
trump every day and he does a lot of
opinion pieces and here's what collinson
said he said the fact that lies and
conspiracy theories now represent
sincerely held views of a large minority
of the electorate thanks to trump's
mastery of demagoguery and the endless
flattery of a compliant right-wing
propaganda machine
now
i think what he's trying to say
stefan collinson is that trump is really
really persuasive
now in this context he thinks that he
would be persuading trump would be
persuading people to believe something
that's not true
according to collinson
but
do you remember
oh
back in 2016 or so
when i was telling the world that trump
is the most persuasive person i've ever
seen
and what did people say
they said he's not persuasive
he's just you know whatever and people
just like him that's all and he gets a
lot of attention that's all
and
one by one you would see trump doing all
of these persuasive things you would see
it completely working
and now we're at the point where he is
so persuasive
that cnn is concerned that they will
take once again
take their fake framing of the big lie
and turn it around on them
so they're worried that he's so
persuasive he could do
what really almost nobody could do
can you name anybody else who could do
that
take this big lie thing that's already
out there and it's big and it already
has a meaning can he take that already a
fully formed meme or thought in the
world and and flip it around
like he did with fake news
yes
yes he has the ability to do that
name one other person
on the whole planet
who you would say yeah that's he could
do that or she could do that
nobody
nobody there's not one other person on
the whole planet
who could pull that off
i'm seeing uh scott uh in the comments
saying elon musk maybe
he's good
that's a pretty good
pretty good comment
but
and now i don't think anybody but trump
could pull that off and he probably will
he probably will pull it off
in the fake pool poll business cnn also
reports that
there's a reuters ipsos poll that says
uh
53 percent of americans are approving a
biden
compared to trump's 38 rating at the
same time in his presidency
didn't i just tell you that there was a
rasmussen poll like maybe the other day
erasmus and polls said that
um
that biden's approval was
roughly comparable to where trump's was
at the same time
what the hell good are polls
like what's the point of a poll
it just looks like they're making
up right
and you and i can't tell which poll is
right
but
we don't we do know that rasmussen has
been consistently closer than the
competitors
so it looks like cnn is just
just quoting a fake poll
i don't know if that's true but it looks
like it it's just what it looks like
all right here's another piece of news
soros handed out a million dollars to a
group attempting to defund police
um
i used to say
that he couldn't possibly be doing soros
could not possibly be doing the things
that people say he's doing because they
just sound too on the nose
like it just sounds too much like
somebody just made up a bogeyman and
it's going to be him and you know you
worry about the fact that he's jewish
and you say is that why
is that why people are demonizing him is
it really just anti-semitism in disguise
or not even disguised
so i've always been a sort of skeptic
but is this true did he really give a
million dollars to a group that is very
vehemently against police uh being
funded
is that really true i mean it's reported
in the news it's on fox news
but
really
like really
because in the past when people would
say soros funded something
it always felt a little indirect
you know okay soros funded black lives
matter
but
a lot of well-meaning people who just
like the
you know like the message did that
so that didn't make him a devil
you know even if you don't like some of
the things black lives matter does
but this one seems
super direct
if somebody's giving a million dollars
to an american somebody outside the
country is giving a million dollars to a
group trying to defund police
they're an enemy
they are basically a terrorist
because it looks like i mean if this is
true and i don't know if it's true but
if it's true that a non-american gave a
million dollars to an american entity
fighting against the police to defund
them
that's an act of terrorism
isn't it
could
could russia or china
donate a whole bunch of money
to a group that wants to do something
that's clearly bad for the united states
could they do that
and what would happen if they did
i mean suppose they just did it openly
suppose china said look we're going to
give a
you know
100 million dollars to the groups that
want to defund police in the united
states
could they do that
i'm seeing in a comment china has
already but i don't think that's
confirmed
um
i mean it seems like it would have been
news
yeah
so i'm going to say that i'm uh i've now
moved from total skepticism that soros
was anything except some anti-semitic
or you know maybe
even you know subconsciously could have
been anti-semitic
but to me it always looked like that
but if this story is true and i still
don't believe it's true
i'm still skeptical about the story
being true at all but if it's true
it's terrorism
am i wrong
isn't this an act of financial terrorism
it seems obvious to me
defunding the police doesn't have any
potential upside
it just looks like terrorism
well that's my opinion
all right um
the best joke i saw on twitter you're
not going to like
but i
i'm still strongly in the camp
i'm strongly in the camp that uh funny
is funny even if you're on the receiving
end of it
when somebody makes a terribly cutting
remark about me which
happens fairly frequently as you may
have noticed
um
if it's funny enough
i'll like it
you know it just has to be funny i don't
care what people say about me as long as
it's good and funny i'm all i'm all in
favor of it
and so with that in mind
uh chad booter on twitter i don't know
who he is but he said that the trump
rally in arizona
appears to be indoors and without masks
for most every attendant
and then chad goes on is the arena where
it's taking place actually called the
delta center or is that just what it
will be referred to
as in about a week
okay that's pretty funny
the delta center now it wasn't the delta
center or the delta center somewhere
else but it's still a good joke
all right
i was alerted to a small article of
interest
in which
a character you may have heard of called
code monkeyz real name ronald watkins
people on twitter probably know him
um i guess he's a data expert or
what would he call it a cyber security
expert
and he was talking about the fact that
mike lindell apparently has captured a
bunch of packets or all of them or some
of them or something from the election
and he has the packets
and he claims that you know there might
be something that you can see in the
packets that suggests there's some fraud
now here's what ron watkins says who's
an expert in these things
and i don't know what to believe yet
right
so
um yeah somebody says he hosted the
keyboard
so uh there there is uh
there is a uh internet rumor that he has
something to do with q
but that's a separate story right i'm
just going to tell you what he has to
say
the fact that his background is
let's say something we would like to
know more about
is uh not relevant to his claim okay
so your your comments about who he is
personally
and whether he can be trusted or valid
comments
but
what he says is either true or false so
let's just look at the comment
and what he says is that
and i don't know how much of this to buy
into because it's not my field
but he says that uh
and i hope i'm summarizing this right i
may not be
but if lindell has unencrypted packet
data
there's something that needs to be
explained
number one
how would he have unencrypted data
because packets are typically encrypted
when they're sent across the internet
so if he somehow got them
you know in the middle
they would be encrypted so he couldn't
have them and you wouldn't be able to
unencrypt them
but if he has them and they're
unencrypted
where to get them
where'd they come from
because there's no source of unencrypted
data
and
if the election system
was for whatever reason
did something very non-standard which is
you know
flip the bit to not encrypt them
if the software was intentionally set to
not encrypt well that's a big problem
and i'm not saying that's the case i'm
saying that if we look at all the
possibilities
to explain how mike lindell could have
any unencrypted packets at all
where'd they come from
where'd they come from
um
imagine being
i'm seeing some people uh
some people lost audio on locals if you
lost audio just reboot refresh your
browser
upgrade your app something like that
it'll work
um
anyway so i'll just put that out there
if anybody knows more about this field
than i do let me know but is there
reason to believe that
lindelo's packets are even real
you know did somebody give them to him
and maybe they're not exactly real
i don't know but there's a question
there
we hear that the the news says that the
department of justice has declined to
investigate
cuomo governor cuomo's handling of the
covet 19 in nursing homes what do you
think of that
do you think
that the department of justice should
have investigated cuomo's handling of
the
nursing homes and you know all the
deaths that happened because he sent the
infected people back
well
why should they
i there's no reason given
we we have a report of a terrible
mistake
where a governor did something that
almost certainly led to people dying
but that's not a crime
governors can make mistakes so
why do you think the department of
justice should have investigated this
there's not even an allegation of a
crime
there's an allegation of a mistake
that's not a crime
and as far as we know it's fairly
transparent
they did they they thought they were
following the rules
but it wasn't a good decision
that's it
criminal negligence is a crime i don't
think there's any negligence there
because i believe that they were within
the guidelines of
some regulations so i think that they
thought they were doing the right thing
you know being wrong
while you're trying hard is just not a
crime
and i'm i i think i would uh
not i think i'll just say
i favor this decision
i'm not in favor of
uh sending to jail or doing an
investigation every time one of our
leaders messes up no matter how bad it
is right if you kind of know the
situation
it's just a mistake it's a bad one one
of the worst we've ever seen
but it's not a crime
i don't think
here's a question for you i was reading
in the daily mail so that's a british
publication so things might be different
over there
but they re they refer to the delta
variant
of the coronavirus they refer to it as
the indian
delta variant
can we say that in this country
this country being america
you might be somewhere else at the
moment
but
can the daily mail call it
the delta variant a an indian delta
variant
but then later in the very same article
they do not refer to the virus that came
out of china as the china virus or the
chinese virus
if you were going to refer to the
quote indian delta variant
shouldn't it be called the india
delta variant
because it has nothing to do with the
people of india although i guess if
that's where
if that's where it uh mutated you could
argue yes
but
it came from india
don't we say the country we don't say
the people right so you don't say indian
delta varia you say india
delta variable
but you should also be able to say the
china virus
if we're confident that's where it
originated just like other viruses that
yeah we give a name
so
what's up with that
is china banned because china has enough
power to do that but india doesn't try
to ban things in the
in britain or the united states just a
question
why are they being treated differently
here's another question
what happened to seasonality
do you remember that do you remember all
coronaviruses go away in the summer
that used to be a thing right
even
even the the covid 19
last year went way way way down but it
didn't go away
and then when you know
the holidays came and it ramped back up
just like you'd expect
but the delta variant
is increasing
in the warm months
how does that happen
how do you get a virus that's increasing
in strength in the warm ones now i get
it's 200 percent more spready
but isn't that a weird variation
of of all the things that could be
variant
in a virus and i imagine there could be
quite a few
you know you would vary how deadly it is
i suppose but you would also vary how
how much you could catch it
what are the odds
that this one little virus is the first
one
where its variant
makes it extra spready in the summer
really
so i'm just going to put out a a
hypothesis here or at least no it's not
even a hypothesis it's less than that
it's a
a possibility
do you believe that this is a variant
versus a new virus
could you not engineer
two viruses
when you were engineering the one that
got out of the lab
why do we think
that we know for sure
that this variation happened out in the
population
as opposed to a second virus
from the same lab
do you think that they only did one
variation of covid when they were
testing and so just that one variation
is the one that got out
you don't think they tested more than
one variation
i feel like
i feel like it's obvious that they
tested more than one
could somebody who knows viruses
tell me if we can confirm is that even a
thing
that we can confirm that the delta virus
was natural
versus came out of the same lab
if in fact the first one came out of a
lab we don't know yet do we
and
what is it about the delta variant
that's the dog not barking
listen listen for it
do you hear the dog not barking
it's a virus that's 200 percent more
spready
and even that
can't penetrate
china
yeah a lot of other countries having a
real big problem
with this extra spready
virus
but coincidentally
where it seems to have started the
so-called indian delta variant
isn't that funny that it started with um
china's one of china's or if not the
biggest rival
so china's biggest rival
is where the delta variant began
if you were china
and i'm not saying that this happened
i'm just saying hypothetically if you're
looking at all the possibilities to
explain how we got here
could you say that if china had
weaponized the first one
and it worked it took down pretty much
the whole world except china
and you had a second one
that you could make it look like it was
india's fault
would you release it in india
if you knew that the delta variant
didn't have much impact on ethnic
chinese people
would you release it
because if you say to yourself my god
scott
my god
you can blame china of a lot of things
but one thing they definitely wouldn't
do
they're not going to release a deadly
pandemic virus
even if they know it can't affect their
their local people
they're not going to i mean that would
just be so evil
it would be beyond anything we could
imagine it would be so evil
is that outside the realm of things
they're doing right now
because they are credibly accused of
taking organs from dissidents who are
alive
to sell them and give them to people who
need transplants
there's credible evidence that that's
happening what about the uyghurs
the the uyghur concentration camps
that's right now
what about all the spyware the ip theft
the you know the jailing of people for
reasons that we're not sure
good what about hong kong
what about the south china sea
yeah what about fentanyl
fentanyl is the perfect analogy to the
delta variant
if we know that china and i think we do
china is shipping fentanyl to the
cartels to ship to the united states to
kill americans tens of thousands every
year is that worse
is that worse
than intentionally
um putting a virus in the world that
doesn't affect uh people who are
ethnically chinese
if that's what happened
you know again
we're speculating here
but
to me
i it looks like the obvious
the obvious possibility is that the
delta variant is not actually a variant
now i would like to be
fact checked on that so if anybody can
find an actual doctor scientist
who can tell me how they determine a
variant is a variant
and how they know that it happened in
the wild
maybe i'm wrong
but china is very bad for business
speaking of that there's a hashtag china
unsafe
number four biz
china unsafe for biz
and i think adam dopamine came up with
this because you had to shorten it to
make it fit
and
i i started to use it today and i
couldn't remember the exact form of it
but i thought well i'll just start
typing it and it'll autofill because
i've seen adam use it a bunch of times
on twitter so obviously the hashtag is
out there i'll just make it autofill
but it didn't autofill
you can type actually the entire
the entire hashtag
and it won't autofill
now can somebody tell me
is that common
are there other hashtags that are in use
but maybe they're not used that much
that also don't autofill because there
might be a threshold
like if only one person ever used it you
know maybe it doesn't autofill
so it's just a question
and
will it ever autofill if we use it
enough you know if i use it every day
and other people use it
will it start to autofill or auto
complete
i don't know
somebody says yes it happens to me a lot
so it looks like it might be just
algorithmic it could be that it just
isn't used enough
to autofill that could be
but how hard would it be to make it
autofill
if it's the only one i mean there wasn't
one that was sort of like it
it sort of stands alone oh who knows
as the delta variant is ripping through
the public again you know we're going to
talk about mass and lockdowns and all
that
and
i think we should just say the lockdowns
are immoral at this point
because everybody who can who wants a
vaccination can get it
and if everybody's getting what they
want
the problem's kind of over
and
i do believe in the theory that we don't
have any way to vaccinate against
the virus
we have vaccinations but they don't
vaccinate against spreading
they're just therapeutics in vaccine
form
so since we're all going to get the
virus
that just seems obvious at this point
does anybody disagree with the
with the notion that everybody's going
to get the virus
now i don't know if it's 100 of the
vaccinated people who get it but it
looks like we would
because we're not immune
and it's 200 percent more spready than
the one that was very spready
so there's nothing that would stop us
all from getting it
so shouldn't the strategy at this point
be to operate at maximum hospital
capacity
think about it
do you want your hospitals to be empty
not if you want to get to the end of it
if you want to get to the end of this
thing you want your hospitals to be
packed to capacity but not over
so you want to operate as close to as
many sick people as you can get into the
hospital
that's your maximum best strategy
seems counterintuitive right because
we've been we've been managing to get
the lowest number of people in the
hospital
and now we know that that was the wrong
strategy
now it would have been a mistake i think
to let everybody get infected before the
vaccinations were out there
because it's the vaccinations that take
the take the edge off it
right but as of today
now that we know that the vaccination
doesn't stop the spread
and we know that nothing will because
the summer doesn't stop it the variants
are going to be
going through like crazy
shouldn't we be looking to get as
infected as possible
and then the people who are vaccinated
get what they want which is they give
full immunity because they'd have
vaccine
plus exposure
and they wouldn't get that sick they'd
have a few days off from work with a
sniffle
so the people with vaccines would
largely get what they wanted now of
course some people are going to have bad
outcomes no matter what so that's baked
into the system every every path you
take
sorry
every path you take
a bunch of people die
so you can't avoid people dying
i'm seeing some people saying that tests
are not infections that's a separate
story
but can somebody just
just disagree or agree with the strategy
that now we have all the vaccines that
anybody wants so that whether you're
vaccinated or not is only your own
choice that's the only thing right now
in that condition and when the vaccine
the virus can't be stopped
don't you want as many vaccines as many
people to get infected as possible
right up to the point where your
hospitals are
operating at full capacity but not over
that's where you want to be right
now i
i'm looking for some pushback on that
because i feel like it couldn't be that
obvious or we'd be doing it or maybe
it's just something you can't say out
loud maybe if you're a leader you can't
say out loud what i just said
now i am seeing people saying that the
pcr testing is fraudulent and it's
picking up people who maybe are not
infectious and blah blah blah but i'll
ask again whatever happened to rapid
testing
remember the idea that you would have
these
less
less
sensitive but very cheap
available tests and everybody could just
test as much as they want wouldn't catch
them all but it would give so many that
it would take care of the pandemic
i don't know now that we know that the
that you can get the virus when you're
vaccinated
i think you just have to all bets are
off we're just all going to get this
damn thing
yeah the fda just confirmed that pcr is
flawed but we always knew that that's
not really new news we knew that some of
the tests were not telling us what we
wanted them to take
all right well weirdly i got exactly
zero pushback on that so
um
and i'm still it's still weird to me
that the delta variant is not
crushed by seasonality
the first the first virus ever
that gets stronger in the summer
what the hell is that going to do in the
winter by winter we're all going to have
covert right
if it's this strong in the summer
it's going to just rip through us in the
winter and i think that by next year
this time enough people will be infected
that
that is really going to slow things down
but i don't think we have any choice at
this point
all right um
i i did a uh tweet that i want to
read you some of
the responses to them so let me do that
so i asked uh people to predict a
headline in one year
all right so predict what a headline
will be in one year
and i i seated it with my own uh
offering here
this headline you'll see one year from
now
infrastructure bill
still stalled
so that's mine one year from now we'll
still be talking about an infrastructure
bill
but here's some of what other people
suggested
school choice is the new white flight
the newest iteration of white people
trying to separate from people of color
or a year from now it might be
states ponder lockdown says new x
variant emerges
yep
um
pelosi's 1-6 committee demands

somebody is predicting that a year from

it's five dollars a gallon now
in in california and i think it's it's

china admits massive nuclear radiation

maybe uh
all right
so
it looks like maybe comments uh
paused on locals that might be a bug
all right so in
i was streaming this on both platforms

in case uh youtube
decides to hide this one
ryan says a year from now the headline
will be
scott adams still saying the golden age
is coming
you know we're in it
this is the golden age
think about the problems that we talked
about
uh our
athletes are kneeling
that's like a big problem
the people who have the vaccination and
wanted to avoid coved
successfully did it
the people who didn't want vaccination
and were happier getting the virus
itself
they're getting it
who's losing
the economy is doing great
north korea looks calm i don't think
we're going to get into any nuclear
fights with anybody at the moment
china is in decline they don't know it
yet but they are
compared to the united states
nuclear energy is getting way more
attention and credit than it ever got
before
we do have a massive inflation problem
but i think we'll probably work through
it
probably work through it
yeah i mean there are certainly
items that are worse like gas prices
but i would say that we're in pretty
good shape
we're in pretty good shape
i think
uh
i don't know that things have ever been
better than they are right now weirdly
yeah inflation is the one thing to worry
about but i do think that we'll we'll
figure that out we'll get a handle on it
um
what are the chances that china's food
diet has to do with infections well
there was the theory that green tea
um helps you avoid covid
so if you've got two things going for
you your your genetic situation
tells you how bad it will be
but the green tea might help it too that
would be two reasons that china might be
having less of a problem the other
reason would be that they're locking
down so well
i just don't believe it
i just don't believe that
well well
let me ask you this
do you think that there's no
intelligence agency anywhere
that doesn't want to infect china with
the with the coronavirus
you know so let's say that china has
actually done such a great job of
lockdown that they just don't have it
you don't think that there's one country
in the world
whose intelligence agents with agents
would say
you know
maybe put a little bit of virus over on
the other side of the border in china
just a little bit of infection
because they need to enjoy the same
thing that the rest of the world was
enjoying
which is pandemic
you don't think that there's one country
anywhere on earth
who is mad enough at china to actually
do that
because that's the thing that's
that's sort of bothering me
i feel as if somebody would have
intentionally reinfected china
just out of revenge
but it's not happening
so does that mean that they can't be
infected
because it seems like it would have
happened by now i don't think america
would do it necessarily
all right
do they have the antidote we'd know if
they had the antidote all right that's
all for now and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
