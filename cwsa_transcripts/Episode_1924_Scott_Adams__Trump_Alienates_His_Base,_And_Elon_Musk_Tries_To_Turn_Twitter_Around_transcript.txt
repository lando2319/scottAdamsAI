good morning everybody
wow do you look
good
I don't know you've probably been
exercising a little extra maybe doing
your breathing exercises I don't know
after we do the simultaneous sip
uh I'm going to give you a reframe
that will change your life
that's my challenge do you think I can
do that do you think I can give you
like two sentences that will change your
life right I think I can actually like
actually I think I can
truly uh all right but before we do that
we're going to take it up a notch you
ready here we go all you need is a
copper mugger glass attacker Charles
Stanley canteen jungle flaska festival
and fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it happens now go
uh savor it savor it good good
all right are you ready for the reframe
in just a few sentences that will change
your life
you ready here it comes
you're not waiting in line
you're doing breathing exercises
that's it so I've been trying to figure
out some way that I could work the habit
of breathing exercises into my daily
life it turns out that every day I spend
at least some time standing in line
Right grocery store or Starbucks or gas
station or something so you're always
standing in line
so you could take out your phone
which is what I used to do take out my
phone and then I would uh probably make
myself more anxious
I would enjoy it that's why I look at my
phone but actually a little anxious
doesn't it
so instead uh I I'm having really good
success
with that Andrew huberman
two inhales and one long exhale you know
you do one big sniff in with your nose
and then before you exhale you do a
second you know aggressive sniff so you
fill your lungs with two two nose sniffs
and they do one long exhale and I could
actually feel the uh like the extra
energy that causes anxiety I like to say
it that way I can actually just feel it
go away instantly
but it doesn't stay away
you know but if you keep doing the
breathing thing it does feel like it
lasts a while
um so I've been doing the breathing
exercises got off all of my blood
pressure meds yesterday I checked my
blood pressure it was uh one 118 over
78.
on nomads and and the other thing I've
been doing differently is the breathing
exercises but I have been you know
walking and exercising and doing all the
right stuff
so
um and let me check in with you
honestly I've I've always believed that
I could get a lot of benefit out of
breathing exercises because all of the
science everybody who's tried it is very
consistent right it's one of the things
you've been hearing for years but
um it's hard to actually work it into
your life
and the part that I couldn't figure out
is how to carve out you know a little
breathing time or a little meditation
time and I just realized I don't need to
just whenever I'm bored
instead of my phone I'll just do some
breathing exercises it's been great so
far
well you see how that changes your life
um
you know interestingly on a similar
topic I guess uh Dr huberman
who is the you know the person promoting
this breathing exercise
um and other things
he did some big live event at the Beacon
Theater in New York City it was it was
packed I saw a picture of it and I saw a
tweet from Adam dopamine
who says you'll notice the golden age
when educators are celebrities
and I thought wow that's kind of
happening Jordan Peterson is is a
celebrity educator
wouldn't you say
yeah uh yeah weirdly you had Joe Rogan's
a celebrity educator in you know in his
own way through guests
but uh yeah uh Andrew hooverman is
exactly that he's he's famous for being
somebody educating people yeah Lex
Friedman
um I think Tim Ferriss maybe maybe the
original
but uh VD Hanson right
so I I like that now
I've used other uh other descriptors
like internet dads and stuff but I do I
try to do the same thing you know I'm
trying to give you useful things and
see if it helps your life
um the best
fetterman joke so far
from Twitter user Blake beeve or bae b e
y
and he tweeted this today
Biden slash fetterman 2024. it's a
no-brainer
yeah that would be that's the bumper
sticker I want to see
Biden fetterman 2024 it's a no-brainer
yep
it's tough to top that joke
I've been waiting for I've been waiting
for somebody to capture just the right
Spirit of it
there it was there it was now many of
you probably saying to yourself and I
heard this a lot on social media
fetterman how can those Democrats elect
somebody who performed so poorly in
public
uh and that was actually my digital
assistant talking to me for some reason
anyway
so but here's what I would encounter
through that have you had that same
feeling
the amphetamine doesn't look like he's
up to the job of being a senator you've
had that feeling right let me give you
some context
think about how many people are in
Congress okay
that's a lot
at the center to the house
how many how many are there if I if you
add them together 535 or is that just
the house at 435 plus 100 yeah so five
they're 535 of them
all right now here's a question that's
going to mess with your head
how many do you regularly see on TV
it's the same 12 or so right
and do you know why you see those same
12.
and and think about that on the Democrat
side that that 12 would include Adam
Schiff
and Eric swalwell
it's the best we have
the the 12 that you see
it's the best we have
now I think some of those 12 are
actually very strong
right Tom Cotton you'll you see him a
lot very strong uh politician
uh Rand Paul yeah very strong
Ted Cruz very strong
but I'm thinking that the fact that we
only see about six Republicans and about
six Democrats
I have a theory that most of the rest of
them would be sort of a John Federman if
you put him on TV
a little bit more of a John Federman
situation if you know what I mean now
I'm only partially joking
but not really
there's a reason you only see 12 of them
it's because they're the only ones who
can do it or they're interested or they
come off well on TV I feel like the rest
of the Senators are a generic guy and a
generic woman
right
like all the rest of them are the guy
with the he has the right hair
that's about it he's got the voice in
the hair
um Senator I've got the right hair and
I've got the right voice and I'm the
senator from the great state of I don't
know one of the ones you never hear
about yeah I'm about the senator I'm the
race Center and then if it's a woman
it just looks like a real estate agent
who aged out of the real estate job
[Laughter]
uh uh all right so federmen can't be any
worse than the average
and really they mostly vote for their
own team so what's the difference he'll
be fine
um
I continue to watch CNN for its uh
indications is really moving to the
middle and it's going to stay there and
sure enough sure enough
so I watched a clip on Don lemon's
Morning Show
and I know I know as soon as I said Don
Lemon you said well
okay CNN's not moving to the middle
there right but watch me surprise you
Don Lemon actually said something I
totally agree with all right
here it comes it's kind of mind-boggling
yeah this is actually mind-boggling not
only did Don Lemon say something that I
agreed with but you will too
you will too and it's gonna it's gonna
make you angry you know if you're not a
Don Lemon fat you're going to be angry
how much you you agree with them do you
think I can do that
do you think I can say something I can
quote Don Lemon from this morning
and that my audience will agree with
them do you think do you think that's
possible
all right they're talking um he and some
others were talking about
a clip of Lindsey Graham giving a
a weirdly emotional plea for Herschel
Walker
and Lindsey Graham looked like he was
going to cry
you know some people were teasing him
looked like he was drunk in the morning
I don't think he was drunk but he was
weirdly emotional I mean he's
for
I I didn't understand it honestly
I didn't really understand
why Lindsey Graham was so emotional but
here's what he was selling he said that
a vote for Herschel Walker would be you
know I'm paraphrasing would be
inspirational for black conservatives
and so voting for Herschel Walker is
much bigger importance because it could
help bring black conservatives into the
conservative movement and so it's much
bigger than you know Herschel Walker
and uh
van Jones said
uh you know not a big fan of Herschel
Walker and Van Jones says
if you're a black uh if you're black
conservative and you want somebody to
admire admire Tim Scott
and I thought that's why I like van
Jones right I've always liked van Jones
because he at least he at least puts
things in a attempt to see both sides
you know he takes aside
he takes a side that's okay everybody
takes aside but at least he shows the
other side right when he talks about it
so he actually gave an example of a
conservative that black voters should
look up to and here's the thing he
didn't he didn't uh he didn't hedge it
right you'd expect a hedge it's like
well you know Tim Scott but that's the
best you can do or just some kind of
hedge but no you just said there's one
you can look up to so I said okay that's
CNN looking pretty open-minded yeah at
the same time he was slamming Herschel
Walker
uh then Don Lemon bus uh Lindsey
Graham's appeal to Herschel Walker as
being an inspiration to Black voters and
here's what Don Lemon said
isn't that identity politics
isn't that race race politics
yup
[Laughter]
yup that's what it was
that that was exactly race politics and
now how blown away are you
how Blown Away are you that you're
agreeing with Don Lemon right now
on CNN
now he's pointing out as a criticism
right it's um it's hypocritical
but
as soon as I heard it as soon as I heard
it I said ah why am I agreeing with you
because he's right
yeah it's it's actually easy to agree
with Don Lemon when he's right
turns out it wasn't hard at all he just
had to be right
um
so Twitter
the Twitter situation is just so
interesting I what a time to be alive
so Twitter depending who you listen to
Twitter is either you know blowing up or
it's going to be the biggest thing ever
and I think it's totally a you know a
Schrodinger's cat situation where it's
sort of both
and if you look at musk's pattern with
his other companies they were all close
to failure
I mean really dire situation before they
became huge
you know Tesla and space SpaceX
uh and now he's he's doing the same play
with Twitter so he's told the employees
it's a dire situation using that word
dire it's reported today he's even said
bankruptcy is possible
and you know advertisers are leaving and
and they're bleeding money four billion
dollars a day and uh the executives are
quitting and allegedly fired one of them
for being disrespectful and you know now
all the executives gone
so let me ask you this
have you ever heard of a tech company
that didn't operate well because the
executives left
will it make any difference what were
they doing
I'll bet those Executives weren't doing
anything but bitching for the last week
only no difference you know as long as
you have enough of the technical people
coming to work
you're pretty good now uh the head of
sales left and I think the marketing
I'll get fired
so what happens when you fire everybody
in marketing
well if you're Elon Musk
he reports that Twitter usage is at an
all-time high
it's not an all-time high so he's
getting all the interest he wants
who knows how much of that will last
but people are bitching like crazy about
feature changes and you know buying
buying your little uh you know Twitter
um verification and now there's going to
be a new thing where you're not only
verified which means you're a real
person but you're also some kind of a
notable person or something I don't know
so uh people like me we we got slammed
back at level
I think it's going to stay that way so
in other words my
my sort of prestige for being a blue
check person on Twitter I think will be
taken away
in the sense that all you know I'll fit
in with anybody who's verified now is
that good or bad
what do you think
so not from my point of view but from
your point of view
from your point of view is it good or
bad that I'm brought down to same level
as everybody else
most of you say good all right I'm going
to take I'll take I'll take your view
right obviously obviously it's not my
self-interest
you can see that right it's not to my
self-interest I don't like it don't like
it but I'm not going to stop using
Twitter
and the fact that you all like it that's
good enough for me
if it's good enough for all of you
that's good enough for me you know I
don't have to win every
like I don't have to win every game
right sometimes you can win that's okay
you win this one that's all right with
me
all right
um
some more interesting things
um
did you hear that uh Biden was asked and
it looked like a planted question from
Bloomberg the Bloomberg company uh if
Baidu thinks that uh musk's foreign
business connections should be
investigated by the government
to which I said and then Biden gives
this
the squinty like evil look
and it takes a long time to answer I
think that might be worth looking into
now of course
you know he's got his own foreign
connection problems that are well
reported
uh so there's the hypocrisy angle but
it's really chilling isn't it
because on one hand
on one hand I'm glad that my government
would at least be you know sensitive to
a billionaire you know who owns a major
communication platform and if they have
any foreign ties there's a Saudi
investor who's part of the deal
so I don't mind that that gets looked
into but it doesn't look like they're
looking into it because it's a good
thing to do
it really looks like they just want to
take him out
doesn't it like it doesn't feel like
your government doing the government's
job which I wouldn't mind at all if they
were a little bit Vigilant about a
billionaire with a major communication
platform that's not the worst thing in
the world
but I think you need something I think
you need something a little solid
to you know maybe hang your hat out
before you scare the and even saying it
in public is is a super douchebaggy
what do you think of that even if Biden
believes that it should have happened
given that there's no specific claim of
impropriety shouldn't he have shut the
 up
like uh like a citizen of the United
States would do like any good citizen
would do
if you only have a suspicion
that there might be something wrong
without any any actual you know detailed
allegation and you're the president of
the United States you should shut the
 up about a private citizen may or
may not have done something illegal
that's not cool at all you know maybe if
you were a political foe that's
different but he's a private citizen
yeah you you don't accuse him of maybe
being a associated with something
unsavory from the literally from the the
the lectern of the presidency that's not
cool not cool at all
but I don't mind that the government is
in fact
um looking into it all right
um
so apparently uh musk had a All Hands
meeting he called this morning and he's
telling them that one of the things he
wants to do with Twitter you've heard
before is turned it into a peer-to-peer
payment system
now
if if you say to yourself I don't think
that Elon Musk can save Twitter because
not enough people will pay eight dollars
apparently the math agrees with you it
doesn't look like that would work
if you say you can't save Twitter
because there won't be enough
advertising Revenue
looks like you're right
so it looks like if you added your
subscriptions to his advertising fees it
doesn't come close to paying the bills
even with after the layoffs
now I'm open to a fact check on that but
I don't but I think that's true right
that it's not really close
am I right
now
how much money could he make as a
payment system
what what would a what would a brand new
payment system be worth
if
you're already using it every day
it's got hundreds of millions of users
who are already the base
is created by Elon Musk who is one of
the PayPal creators so clearly this is
an industry that he has connections and
and probably more
he's probably as qualified as anybody in
the planet to build a pavement system on
top of Twitter I mean who who else would
you pick for that right
um
now imagine all of the things that you
might want to use a payment system for
such as everything you see on Twitter
let me tell you what my experience is on
Instagram
so Instagram shows me an ad every day
that I want to buy
every day every single day I see an ad
because they're really good at matching
the ad I mean so it's like they're
reading my mind
uh and do you know why I don't buy it
through Instagram
because I don't have a payment system
that's like automatically connected I
don't do they have even Google payment
connected I don't know but it looks like
it takes me to the individual company's
own
payment system that I have to put in all
my information so you know what I do I
go to Instagram I see an ad for
something I want
and then I go to Amazon and I buy it
and and Instagram loses that transaction
right if Instagram let me click on the
ad and pay it with a payment system that
was built into Instagram and I already
have I have Google uh what is it Google
pay or whatever it is I have that right
so some kind of other system to connect
in there
now do they I I'm surprised
yeah the the Apple doesn't work on the
individual uh payment sites though like
if you go to the company's own site
Apple payment doesn't seem to work all
the time
right anyway so here's my point
the potential uh for Twitter as a
digital payment site is way bigger than
its potential as social media you get
that right
now
here's an expert
if you could use venmo
but you think venmo might turn you off
for your political opinions
or you could use the Twitter payment
system and you're pretty sure you won't
get turned off for your political
opinions
which one are you going to use
do you see it yet
to a a Twitter payment system would be
almost automatic
for anybody who didn't want to use a
system that was going to penalize you
for being a conservative
do you know how much money Elon Musk
could make with a payment system that
wasn't going to kick you off for your
opinion
nobody else is making one are they
now now let me take you a little further
if you're one of the richest people in
the world one of the things you should
own
would be uh
a satellite Network that does internet
check
got it
got that you also need a media a media
platform that's Twitter
what's the what's the last thing you
need
that you really really need not Mars no
not narrowlink although neurolinquently
pooporn no not an army no you need a
bank
Elon Musk
I think
is going to be your bank
now I don't know that but I don't think
you'd be happy with just being another
peer-to-peer payment company
I I think he would he would just go full
bank if he goes full Bank there is no
limit to how much money he can make
yeah now you're talking a trillion you
know you're talking like as as big as
you know a Wells Fargo size valuation
so the
um the the part that the average
non-business person sees here is that
he's in total trouble
you know he's bleeding money and people
are quitting and they're all mad at him
and the features aren't working then
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
but you're blinded to the fact that
combining Twitter with a payment system
might be one of the biggest most
valuable companies ever created in the
history of civilization
so there's that
there's that
all right
so apparently on CBS uh on a show called
the good fight which I've never seen
um
there was a plot line in which the real
Governor DeSantis is accused of falsely
accused so even even in the show even in
the show is treated as a false
accusation but you don't find it out and
it's false for a while that there was
something like sexual impropriety and
the fact that a TV show would do a
fictional story about an accusation of a
real person
with a sexual accusation is probably one
of the worst things you'll ever see
now they do treat it as a character made
it up that doesn't help that doesn't
help
no
because once that's in your head it's
paired it's paired in your head with
that's just not cool
that's not cool
so I guess people are complaining but
that end should
I saw a somebody refer to Biden's idea
that he would
do a student loan I guess Fox News calls
it a handout
well what's it called debt forgiveness
but it's not really that it's just
moving the debt to somebody else so so
Fox News calls it a student load handout
all right let's call the handout
um
but it was the perfect bait and switch
wasn't it
the the only thing better than buying
votes
is buying votes and not paying for it
or buying votes with uh the money from
your your opponents or something
Biden actually found a way to convince
idiots that he was going to cancel the
debt even though everybody told him it
was illegal and couldn't happen
and he just said well I'm doing it
anyway and then all the people's like oh
vote for that free money
and then he gets a lot of young people
votes who are like trying to get their
debt canceled I bet that's a big story
part of the young female
oh has anybody said this yet
uh young single women
are more likely to have worthless
college degrees than any other group am
I right
let me say it again the the segment that
is most likely to have a worthless
college degree in other words somebody
who can't pay back their debt
is single women because they don't have
a husband to help
and that's not sexist you know just a
partner to help
and uh they're they're more likely to
have you know taken a less useful
commercial uh kind of a major
by the way I I I might be operating from
ignorance and bigotry but wouldn't the
wouldn't the data back me on this
I'm just spitballing here but and has
anybody mentioned that yet
have you heard anybody in the news yet
mention the connection that the young
young women are the most likely to have
um debt that they can't pay back from
college so this was really kind of a
brilliant play by the Democrats to
promise this thing and then they get the
credit for trying
even though they had to know it couldn't
work
you know what when I say that the
Democrats haven't played the Republicans
they really did they really did the the
Democrats outperformed in the the weasel
tricks and the persuasion and stuff and
and let me let me say it if the
Republicans had done the same thing I
still say it's a weasel play but
effective it worked
so there's that
a good bait and switch
all right I know you want do you want me
to talk about uh Trump
all right so here's the basic story
uh Trump did a lengthy attack on
DeSantis if you want to call it an
attack on Truth social and it you know
bleeds over into the other platforms
and Trump's story I'll I'll just
summarize it is that Trump is the reason
DeSantis is successful
because sometime in the past when
DeSantis was struggling to get elected
for some lower office I guess uh Trump
uh Trump backed him and that was the
difference according to Trump
and now uh Ron de sanctimonious as he
calls him yet again uh is being sort of
a disloyal traitor to Trump
for I think not ruling how to run for
presidency right I think that's all it
is and then
all right so you've got uh Trump's
turning on DeSantis
and then
uh Trump also turned on governor juncken
and so today he he mocked a governor
youngkin and he said he prints his name
as two parts young and then k-i-n-kin
and then in parentheses he said sounds
like a Chinese name
and that's when I tweeted I'm out I'm
out
I'm out I'm not going to do this again
I'm not going to do it again nope not
gonna do that
um here here's my personal thinking
right and this is purely personal
I
I lost about a third of my income for
years and probably forever
for backing Trump
backing Trump was really
expensive both socially
and economically I mean it was just
disaster
but I also thought it was something the
country needed and so I thought well
I can afford it
and so it felt like I was on the right
side right the right side of history and
stuff so you can do a little bit more
take a little bit more pain if you're on
the right side
but
there are now alternatives to Trump
DeSantis being the obvious one that make
his contribution not essential
in other words policy wise Trump kind of
established you know what is and is not
a reasonable policy and I think other
Republicans are going to follow that
example
so you get now a Trump trump policies
without Trump
and
here's the thing that
makes me crazy
I don't know if Trump doesn't know when
he says things that people will easily
interpret as racist
I don't know if he doesn't know
but whether he knows he's doing it or
not
I don't want to be part of it anymore
because he's at an age where I can't
really endorse a president at that age
and uh I don't want to be embarrassed by
him anymore
right I don't want somebody to say he
said that racist thing what do you say
Scott I want to say I don't care
I I don't think he's going to be
president again
now
um if you've taken the temperature on
social media
yeah I've seen people who are saying bye
they're already checking out so if you
if you check the temperature on social
media you can see that people have
really turned on Trump in a way that we
never saw before
we never saw before and
if you were the only option
that would be a different conversation
but he's not
now here's so there are two things I
don't like him when he when he said that
young kin sounded like a Chinese name I
think what he was doing is saying that
he has some connections to China that
you know he wants you to worry about or
something but the way it comes off is
that other way it's like somehow
ethnicity matters to something then it
shouldn't so
and then the other thing is that he
attacked two Governors on his own team
who really didn't have it coming
and that's different than what we've
seen from Trump before the thing you
liked about Trump was attacking the
other team
now Trump would say I'm sure
but you watched me attack all those
Republicans in the primaries in 2016
right he attacked all those Republicans
nobody complained about that
but that was in the primary
that was in the primary if DeSantis says
he's running for president oh yeah fine
the moment the de Santa says he's
running for president yeah whatever he
says fine that's all part of the process
and same with Junkin but if they're not
running against you and they're on the
same team
that just doesn't feel right does it
you know and I'm not you know
necessarily backing either of those two
people I'm just saying it just doesn't
feel the same as it felt you know in the
early days of trump
now
um
here's the only analysis that I think
matters for this Trump DeSantis thing
and I saw a tweet on it from
unhoodwinked a Twitter account
and Underwood doing says this there's no
one who would vote for Trump that would
not vote for DeSantis but that doesn't
work the other way around
that's all you need to know
do you agree
now don't treat it as a real absolute
because there are no such things as
absolutes like this but
DeSantis doesn't really have any reason
to reject them
does he if you're a conservative he has
no reason to reject him but Trump has
reasons
reasons 11th which I totally get but
reasons to reject them
so
now here's the calendar argument I'll
give you the counter argument the
cabinet argument is that Trump won uh I
think it was white Rust Belt
types and nobody won them before and you
would need them to to win I don't know
that our argument works anymore
because I don't know that those Rust
Belt people were voting exactly for his
personality
maybe they were at the beginning but I
think they like the I think they like
the policies
so if they think they can get the Trump
policies without being associated with a
racist
I feel like that might be a better deal
and I don't think Trump is racist by the
way but in terms of how he's being
framed
all right
so here's some more people turning on
people all right so Trump says DeSantis
turned on Trump so now Trump's turning
on DeSantis meanwhile Rupert Murdoch
according to the news is allegedly
turning on Trump
through his you know media organs of Fox
News and Wall Street Journal and the
post I guess
and
yeah there's some reporting that Murdoch
is anti-trump
your post yeah
um
have you seen it did you have you
watched Fox News in the last day or two
would you say that Fox News has gone pro
DeSantis and anti-trump yes or no
in your opinion
has Fox News gone pro de santis and
anti-trump
yeah so Tucker Carlson is going strong
DeSantis and I think
um he entity too
it looks like it yeah so I would say
that the evidence supports that
hypothesis
but we're you know we have to speculate
because we can't read Murdoch's head
it looks like it
um
all right and the you know the buzz is
all the conservative commentators or you
know Trump is dead and Trump is over
um
so now Trump has a big announcement
coming up
do you think he'll uh go ahead and
announce that he's running
or will the feedback that he got this
week
convince him to not run
which would be the most amazing mind F
of all time
I feel like maybe he has to run to keep
truth social alive
because who's going to go to truth
social lift Trump doesn't run
would that sort that would be a tough
business barrier to get past
you would yeah we'll see now uh can I
can I give myself uh some wiggle room in
case I'm wrong about everything
all right I'm gonna give myself some
wiggle room you have to remember I did
this
so that later when you you call me to
the woodshed
I'll have that little excuse here's my
little excuse
nothing about Trump is predictable
okay
so
if if three months from now
Trump is saying all the right things and
um DeSantis said that he's not running
for example uh and it looks like whoever
is going to run on the other side is a
complete waste of carbon
ah
you know I might have to
say what Trump is doing right
but I don't know if I can say I'm going
to be a supporter
but I'm going to be practical I mean I'm
going to do what what makes sense for
America as I see it
wherever that takes me
all right so Georgia runoff Walker and
Warnock gonna
do a runoff
correct me if I'm wrong
the Georgia race was very close which is
why there's a runoff
uh and nobody's complaining about
irregularities are they in Georgia did I
miss it
is anybody complaining about election
irregularities in Georgia
because it would be amazing if they're
not
right
so on the summer
Stacey Abrams was complaining
is she the only one I don't I don't know
that there are any specifics I think
Stacy Abrams was more complaining about
the rules in Georgia not not about
anybody cheating
I don't I don't think she made a comment
about any specific irregularity
yeah
wait Glenn Glenn Younkin has an
engineering degree
hello
I just found my next president
all right
um
yeah what's going on here
yeah so I feel like that's good news
isn't it if Georgia did an election that
was that close so far and people are not
at least no credible people are
complaining about it now let's let's
talk about Arizona
all right here's a little uh knowledge
question for you
the the reason the Arizona is a vote
count for a governor and Senate and more
I guess uh the reason that it's delayed
you all know the reason it's the latest
that Arizona has different rules
than other states
all right why go why does Arizona have
different rules in other states the most
obvious question
Now give me real reasons not not the
funny reasons they're idiots they're
cheaters blah blah hubs well now that
you eat corruption no no those are all
the easy those are the easy reasons no
not that don't give me the easy ones
give me the real reasons
laughs
so it turns out there's actually a real
reason
yeah you want to hear the real reason
and and this I I want to see if any if
you've even heard it
right because this was what was
bothering me I followed the news every
day
like I follow it pretty closely I didn't
know the reason
I didn't know the reason that Arizona
does it differently but there is a
reason
and it's actually pretty good
no and not I so far not one of you knows
the reason
no well signature verification is part
of the reason yes that's not what I was
going for here's the reason
they let you uh vote absentee up until
uh election day so that you don't have
to stand in line to vote
they've eliminated the need to stand in
line to vote but you can still vote on
Election Day you just drop it in a box
right
now is that a good reason
let me tell you one of the reasons that
people don't vote
one of the piece one of the reasons
people don't vote
is because they don't want to wait in
line
that's actually a pretty good reason
isn't it isn't that a pretty good reason
the trouble is that it makes them you
know out of line with the rest of the
country and everybody complains but
um
you could all you could almost
here let me let me uh give you my
overall opinion if I were to engineer
the system myself
I would say let's keep that benefit but
make everybody the same so we'll have
everybody vote on Election Day any way
they want with paper Ballot or anything
else but you say nobody gets any results
for a week
you just say we're not going to give you
any results for a week that's our new
system then you've eliminated waiting in
line
which has got to be a big part of the
friction
I mean I wouldn't wait in line
so anyway so there are some other
differences in Arizona one is that
um they've got pushback in Prior
elections and so they're going really
really extreme to make sure that they're
doing signature verification correctly
it takes longer what do you think of
that
what do you think of them doing more
aggressive signature verification but it
might take longer
it might be good
right it might be good
like on paper that's a pretty good thing
have I ever told you the concept of
malicious compliance
malicious compliance you know what I'm
talking about
right I think that's what's happening
all right here's the Dilbert filter on
the Arizona situation
take yourself back to the prior election
right you're an election worker
and you're just like uh you're not a
leader like you're just you're a lower
level you know functionary and you just
got on by everybody
for not doing a careful enough job of
signature verification
I mean you really really got beat up on
that signature verification thing
next election comes along and nothing's
changed except you got in trouble last
time for not doing signature
verification carefully enough what you
get to do
you're going to maliciously comply
because they probably asked for a lot
more resources probably right probably
got denied
it's now the same who are pissed
off because they got on for not
doing enough verification or giving
people exactly what they asked for
here's your here's your careful
verification
if you want careful verification I'll
stare at this ballot for an hour
I'm getting paid by the hour
let me ask you this do you think the
people who are staring at the signature
verifications do they get paid by the
job
or by the hour what would you guess
if he had to guess
of course they're being paid by the hour
of course of course they are they're
being paid by the hour and they'll get
in trouble if they go fast
but they'll make their they'll make all
the people who complained about them
look like if they go slow so
what are they going to do
malicious compliance I've talked about
this before you see it a lot when people
at a lower level get a on they
start doing the job the way it was
designed to be done which is
inefficiently
because if you follow all the
requirements of the job you can't even
do the job I first learned this when I
worked for the bank I was a bank teller
I've told this story before and I got in
trouble for I don't know not checking
two IDs or something I checked one ID
for some lower dollar amount and
uh you know I got in trouble and my my
boss said you know you got to follow the
rules like these rules are here for a
reason it's two IDs and I argued
something along the lines of this is a
regular customer this is somebody I deal
with like once a week for like you know
months I know this person I practically
know their account number so I took one
idea in that case
and the boss says but that's not the
rule the rule is two ideas you've got to
follow the rules
so I started following all the bank
rules
which resulted in me sending almost
every customer to a supervisor because I
couldn't handle the transaction
all I had to do was follow the rules and
I couldn't do my job
the and the line just went out the door
and eventually my boss came over to me
and she said you know you're like you're
not getting it done I said I'm getting
it done I'm doing everything exactly the
way you taught me I'm following every
Rule and these customers do not have
proper ID so I'm sending every one of
them to you that is what you asked me to
do that is your that's your system
and then she basically whispered to me
you see all these customers from Chevron
because we're uh we're next to a Chevron
headquarters so we got all this Chevron
high paid people he says you see that
little uh pin that they're wearing so I
think it was maybe a tie pit or
something so a lot of the people had
like a five-year a ten year or a 20-year
pin you could actually tell how long
they'd work for Chevron by their
clothing they'd have a little pin with
their length of service she goes if you
see that little pin he goes they're fine
that's like the opposite of you know the
very opposite of Bank rules so basically
she told me to follow the rules or I'd
be fired so I followed the rules and she
learned the hard way that no customer
was served
and then she said don't follow the rules
just just don't follow the rules it's
the only way we could get this done
that might be happening in Arizona
that's what it looks like
all right
um but it annoys me that the reporting
on Arizona is just sort of generically
why don't they do a better job I feel
like you need to dig down at least as
far as I dug down
right weren't you also wondering what
the hell is going on
turns out there's a reason they don't
like lines and it's probably malicious
compliance and I think they had a record
number of uh ballots that need signature
verification too so it's just bigger
load than normal
which none of by the way
to be clear none of this explains why
they can't just do it the way Florida
does it you just have longer lines and
you know some other trade-offs but they
could do it
all right let's talk about Ukraine
it does look like Russia genuinely is
pulling back from the curse on oblast
region but they're at least it looks
like all they're doing is getting on the
other side of the river
so the river you know was like a natural
defensive point so it looks like they're
just taking a winter defensive posture
so I'm not I'm not sure if we can learn
too much about what's happening at the
moment it looks like both sides are
making their their winter strategy
setups you know so it's hard to know
what's going on
um
but I guess the United States has
Twisted the arm of zelenski to at least
say what you would accept
now I'm operating from memory so
zelenski said
you you would consider negotiating with
Putin but he would require
that at the very least Putin gives back
the territory that they he took this
year
interestingly that would not include
Crimea
and I don't know why I'm not seeing a
ton of reporting that Ukraine has
apparently given up on trying to Crimea
back
now none of us thought that that was you
know likely to happen
I don't think many people thought it but
um isn't that a gigantic change
and fact check me he didn't say that
right he said he's happy getting back
what they took this year
so they would Russia would keep Crimea
yeah and I think most people thought
that's where it would end up anyway
right then I think he's asking for a
quote guarantees that it won't happen
again
now that's a good thing to ask for
because it's vague
so you know there's room to work with
that you know the guarantees now the
guarantees could be that Russia says all
right you can have NATO
maybe that's the guarantee or maybe
they'd say we'll remove all you know
offensive weapons or something there's
probably a way to get it
then uh wasn't there also something
about reparations
can give me a fact check of that did
zielinski say there would have to be
reparations
because if he did that's the right thing
yeah he did so that's exactly the right
thing to ask for why why should he ask
for reparations go
why should he ask for reparations
well one reason is
that he should get reparations but
what's the other reason
it's something to trade away yeah it's
uh reparations are a an invisible like
imaginary asset
so he can imagine them into existence
like Trump
Trump was the expert at that imagining
something into existence and then
trading it away to trade at nothing for
something
was zelenski wants is his territory back
and that would be the win of all wins I
mean he would be a legend forever if he
did that
and got a permanent piece so reparations
would be nice you know how awesome would
reparations be but that's not going to
happen it just gives them something to
give up
so if you were to read the ways zelensky
is responding that does look exactly
like somebody who's serious about peace
to me
but as somebody else said it makes no
sense to get to actually agree to peace
while the ukrainians are gaining
territory
however
will they keep gaining territory in the
winter
so I'm not a I don't know enough about
the military capabilities in the winter
to know the following answer are we
guaranteed gonna have four months of
nobody changing anything
because nobody's going to do much in the
winter
so we're kind of guaranteed to a
four-month stalemate right yes or no
I see it now I'm not sure if we're smart
enough to know this are we
a little bit of disagreement
uh winter favors Ukraine somebody says
favors okay
but is that enough that they will get
any serious territorial gain I suppose
you can just keep shelling in the winter
right
I guess that still works yeah so if if
Russia is still within the artillery
range then Ukraine will keep pounding
them yeah that makes sense
now uh next question are the Russian
supply lines for food especially are
they more uh more vulnerable in the
winter
it feels like it right is that an
obvious question or not obvious because
I would think that the offensive ability
might be limited in some ways
just as everything's Limited in the
winter I don't know but but I feel like
the ukrainians might be able to starve
the Russians out
if they have the high Mar system that
can you know hit their hit their food
shipments
but on the other hand on the other hand
it seems like getting food to soldiers
when you're you know you're in Russian
territory
it feels like that's the most doable
thing you know maybe they just have to
do an airlift or something I doubt you
could starve them actually
as long as Russia is a functioning
country
all right
um
I would say that where's whereas having
is
they'll probably have some serious
negotiations this winter
but nobody's gonna neither side would
agree if they think they're going to
have the advantage after the winter is
over
so would either Ukraine or Russia have a
reason to believe
that they would have the advantage in
the spring
would that give Russia time to recoup
and give them an advantage so does
Russia have the advantage by just
waiting
and just continuing to turn the lights
out in Ukraine and bomb their power
stations
I don't know
probably yes
uh I guess I don't know enough to say
yes or no on that
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is the fascinating live stream for today
I think I've delivered on my promise not
only have I paired waiting in line with
breathing exercises which will change
your life
but I think I've given you some takes
you're not going to see
anywhere else
all right
yeah is there any topic I missed
any topic I missed let's see
oh let's talk about uh the systems
yesterday I optimistically uh tweeted
that it was sort of breathtaking to
watch all of our systems self-correct
and I mean that so yesterday the uh did
we get a good uh inflation report or
something yesterday what was it that
drove the stock market up
it was a good CPI report now I wouldn't
believe you know one CPI report
I don't know there was the election
because it the election
would have we would have seen that the
day before
yeah so we were 7.7 now 7.9 so heading
in the right direction all right here's
what I think we are I think our election
system
had the most transparency we've ever
seen
uh thanks to hermit and her Army of
lawyers and and the Republicans having
more access to uh to be Watchers so I
think our election system might be the
best to spend I think that having a
a balanced government
is exactly what the public wanted I
think the public self-corrected the
government by by taking its power away
I think that's what happened
so that's good I think the stock market
is seeing the correction I think our
supply chains are working the way you
know are figuring their way out I think
we are decoupling from China
I think China's in trouble
and almost all of our systems are
self-correcting
and it's sort of amazing to watch it I
think the education system is
self-correcting if you saw Corey
DeAngelis was taking a victory
victory lap and I think he deserved it
because it turns out that the
pro-education choice people the school
choice people those candidates did
unusually well
right and I think he gets credit for
that
so so our education system is
self-correcting slowly
our inflation is coming down slowly
um the the Ukraine war to me it looks
less and less like nuclear war and more
and more like Russia is permanently
degraded
is that a problem
financially this but if they don't nuke
us
I don't know Tick Tock revealed that we
don't know that Tick Tock had any impact
on the election but we can say for sure
that the channel is obvious now
that the biggest group of Voters the
young women are also the target market
of tick tock so if China wanted to
change an election they could do it
here here's a comment I heard I won't
say where I heard this but
um apparently if you're a Tick-Tock user
you will not see much about the
immigration problem
now I'd need a confirmation to that but
I don't think Tick Tock is is sending a
lot of hey immigrations problem look at
all these people streaming across the
border
but I'll bet I'll bet you're seeing
plenty on abortion rights
now is that because of the algorithm
it could be the algorithm is doing what
it's supposed to do which is it might be
young women are very interested in
abortion and much less interested in the
Border Perhaps Perhaps so maybe the
algorithm is you know just doing what
it's supposed to do but the problem is
that China can control that algorithm
and if they did or did not do anything
to interfere with their elections they
can
if you know they can and you can see the
complete path
that Tick Tock has revealed its soft
underbelly
and now it can be destroyed
but until this election you couldn't see
the direct path of how Tick Tock is
influencing the group that influenced
the elections
and if you get caught up on the on the
question of whether that made the
difference I'm not claiming it did
I I don't see direct evidence that it
did I'm claiming that there's now direct
evidence that it would be easy
it would be simple and you wouldn't know
the difference
is Scott a narcissist we've been through
that of course I am
can you really do this job and not be a
narcissist I feel I think everybody who
has a who willingly takes a public
exposure type of job
yes some level must like it right
so always a little bit
yeah but there are two guys that
narcissists there's a good kind and the
bad kind the good kind tries to get
credit for doing things that are good
for you
so
you know there's a reason that people
get like awards for things it's because
when people feel good helping other
people they'll do more of it
so if if being a narcissist and liking
to get credit for doing good things if
that allows me to do more good things
then don't complain
but the other kind is more of a
destructive narcissist it's sort of an
all everything's about them and there's
no conversation after that
uh
Andrew Tate is going to fight Jake Paul
is that true
interesting
