well if i've done
everything correctly the sound quality
on this
production of coffee with scott adams
will be
amazing amazing
um yes and uh i don't think
you could ever have a better time than
enjoying the simultaneous sip
with people around the world around the
world yes
and all you need is a copper margarita
glass of tango chelsea's diet and a
canteen jug of flax vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
makes
everything better watch go
oh yeah oh yeah
so i don't know if you've noticed but
the news has slowed down a little bit
a lot of it has to do with a lack of
president trump
man you take trump out of the headlines
and there's not much happening is there
but we'll talk about what is happening
this might be the the slowest news day
in a while
so over on the locals platform where if
you subscribe
you can see extra content for me
especially the stuff i don't put on
social media because i'll get cancelled
but i did a little demonstration
of whistling up a cat
now i discovered years ago that i could
whistle a certain certain uh frequency
and my cat would come running to me and
she had not been trained
to do that it just was a weird thing i
noticed
and then i got another cat and that same
cat
would respond to the same tone and now
my third cat
so i did a little experiment in which i
whistled
and i wanted to see if people could get
their own cats
to come to just the sound of my whistle
if they just replayed it in their
devices
it turns out it worked so i got a bunch
of
it didn't work for everybody but quite a
number of people responded and said yeah
my cat
or my dog in some cases came running as
soon as they
they played it now here's the
interesting part uh
ricky g who's a subscriber over on
locals
he had his musical keyboard next to him
so he matched
the tone of my whistle to the keyboard
and reports that it is the key of e
natural above middle e
so if you're musical and you know how to
reproduce that on your
keyboard it's the key of e
natural above middle e so try it
and see if you can call your cat with
that
now i think it's going to work if you're
the one doing it as opposed to
playing it through a device
all right it turns out
that there's such a thing as a short
sleeper gene
i've probably told you way too many
times that i hate sleep
i mean i hate sleeping i do it because i
need to
but i hate it and i've maybe told you
before that
if i get more than five hours a night
i'm not happy about it
like if i were forced to sleep eight
hours a night
i would just go crazy i just couldn't
handle it
but five five's about right now it turns
out that
researchers have discovered there are
some genes
that cause some people to be the
so-called
short sleepers and that they actually
get
all the sleep they need in these four or
five hours and these people tend to be
i like this part because it it sounds
good to me
uh they tend to be ambitious that
people wake up after four or five hours
and go to work
like me we tend to be ambitious
so if you hear that there are some
people who don't sleep much
they're just genetically different and i
would have to assume that i'm one of
them
because after years and years of
experience i know i can't sleep eight
hours
and i know it's painful so so there you
have it
uh there's some belief that trump
is one of those people i've heard it
said from i think his butler used to say
that he genuinely only slept three hours
a night
now i think that's probably hyperbole
but i'll bet it's i'll bet he didn't
sleep more than five
um because he does seem to be one of
these short sleepers
um and uh
it also said that 90 to 95 of them had
phenomenal memories now i definitely
don't have a phenomenal memory
or even an especially good one you know
i can force myself to do well in
school and classes if i need to but i
definitely don't have a phenomenal
memory all right my other favorite
question
or favorite story
is i don't know how to feel about this
because
do you ever laugh at things you're not
supposed to laugh at
you do right have you ever found
yourself just
snickering as something that was
bad happening to somebody else but
because it wasn't you and it wasn't
somebody you know
you don't feel good about it
but it's funny so can we all agree
before i talk about this next segment
i'm a terrible person i will stipulate
before i even mention this story
apparently i'm not a good person if you
laughed at this too
well you're not a good person either
join the club
and here's the story and it really is
bad i mean it's genuinely bad
no joke this is nothing to laugh at
but it's funny i can't help it
did you see the video from the tour de
france
where there was a woman on the sideline
and for some reason this is a funny part
of the story the story needed to
specify in the headline that she was
female
a female fan now listen to the story
and ask yourself what part made the
female part important
to the story i'll just leave that there
for you
but the daily mail seemed to think it
was important that you knew
it was a female fan
maybe it's being sexist maybe it's an
important element of the story
you decide
[Laughter]
so it seems that there was a fan on the
sidelines
and some of the tour de france bicyclist
went by
and she decided don't know what she was
thinking yet
that this would be a good time to take a
big old cardboard sign
and go in front of uh
you know actually lean into the route
across the
you know the road and get a really good
uh
get an angle on the video because i
think they saw that maybe
some professional the video people were
over on one corner
so she was making sure that her sign was
very visible
to the people taking the video
now the problem came in that
there were many many bicyclists yet to
pass that narrow road
she blocked one of them with her big old
sign
the guy who hit the sign hit the sign
and went down
behind him were hundreds of people on
bicycles
who could not go over a person who was
on the ground
they laid down too now i don't know how
many bikes went down
they said something like 25 but it
looked like more to me
like you saw the whole crowd just go
down like dominoes
from this one and i don't know why this
is important to the story but
a female fan as the daily mail reports
not just a fan and not a male fan
but a female fan was important somehow
to the story
now i ask you how often does a national
story
have an element of narcissism
in the story
how often do you see a story where if
you really dug
into it you would find at the bottom of
a story
somebody who didn't care about anything
except attention
now i'm not going to diagnose this
female fan
as the daily mail calls her i'm not
going to diagnose her as having a
particular mental
or personality situation but i will say
that a lot of our national stories have
an element that
makes you go hmm there's at least
one person in this story who cares about
attention
more than they care about let's say the
life of other people
on bicycles as one example now i hope
nobody got hurt and it was a tragedy if
you
if you were you know an elite athlete
and you'd worked hard to get into the
tour de france and some idiot with a
sign
ruins your day that's really bad
funny funny but really bad
because i'm a bad person
there's a center for countering digital
hate
we did a little study uh barry ritholtz
was uh tweeting about this
good on a good thread and here's an
interesting factoid
have you ever thought to yourself how
much impact can one person make
how much impact can one person make in
this big old world
one person can't make that much
difference maybe not
but it turns out that 12 people are
responsible for
65 of the anti-vax
content on the internet 12 people
are responsible for 65
of the anti-vaxx content now for the
purposes of this discussion
we're not talking about whether vaccines
are good or bad
right that's a separate conversation you
can have that
on your own i'm just amazed
that 12 people who have some social
media presence
and have a following 12 people
could control 65 of the content in this
topic
the anti-vaxx content it's kind of scary
isn't it
how much how many of those 12 were maybe
influenced by
one or two of the others because it
might be
that really it's two or three people who
happen to influence maybe
you know nine or ten other people who
then
influenced millions of other people
two or three people can make a big
difference when social media
is the is the medium that they're using
so every time you think to yourself well
i can't make much difference in this big
old world
yeah you can you can you might make a
bad difference
or it might be a good difference but
yeah you can 12 people
all right uh i want to talk about a
topic
that you normally turn off but i'm going
to talk about an
angle of it that i feel is worth doing
right i personally have no interest
anymore of whether masks work or don't
work
to hear this part clearly if if you're
going to try to talk me into whether
masks work
or talk me into whether they didn't work
and they're more bad than good
not interested because it's over
i i don't plan to wear a mask again
right
but here's what does interest me how was
it
that you came to your opinion and how
did you
rationalize your opinion whichever it
was all right so again
i don't care what the answer is and i
don't care that you have a strong
opinion on it
i only want to know how you got there
because how you got there will tell you
something about how you think
versus how other people think and might
be useful for the next
topic because what if you were thinking
incorrectly on this one
and nobody call you well that would put
you in a bad position for the next
situation you would be equally
ill-equipped
so the only thing i'm going to do is
point out the bad arguments
which is not to say you're wrong so for
example
if we're going forward and i say well
you made a bad argument
for or against masks that doesn't mean
you're wrong about
whether maths are good or bad just means
that particular argument doesn't make
sense let me give you some
examples all right somebody said
it's math these are responses to me
about masks
mathematically speaking it's like using
a chain link fence to stop a mosquito
that is bad thinking
because the the thinking here is that
the virus is tiny
and the holes in any mask are really big
compared to a tiny virus
but the people who make this argument
always miss the fact
that viruses travel on water particles
some of the small ones do get through
the larger ones do not and that the
the principle of friction is in play
so if your argument is the virus is tiny
compared to the holes in the masks you
do not have a rational argument
so it's not that you're right or you're
wrong that's not rational
because you're leaving out the biggest
part of the argument which is the
viruses travel on water particles and
those are big enough
to be stopped by mask not all of them
and again
the question is not whether particles
get through if you think that's the
question
again you have a bad argument some of
them do get through a lot of them get
through
but the only claim is that it for short
times
in close quarters it might make a
difference that's the only claim of
masks
all right another bad argument is that
fauci and the who and the cdc's told us
directly
the masks do not work
yes they did and then they told you they
were lying
to keep the supply of masks for the
medical people
so if your argument is that fouchy the
who and the cdc
told you directly masks do not work
that's a bad
argument because they admitted they were
lying and then said they definitely do
work
they could be wrong and you could still
be right
i'm just saying that that argument that
they once told you they don't work
is nonsense because they told you they
were lying
all right here's another one um somebody
said that there's evidence that masks
don't work for surgeries and therefore
they extend that argument too it doesn't
work for anything
surgeries are very specific in which
you're spending a tremendous amount of
time
in the close quarters nobody believes
that if you spend infinite amount of
time with a mask on it would stop an
infection
the whole point is that it might stop
some of them if you're in close quarters
for a short amount of time
that's it that's the entire claim about
masks
so anything about surgery is just a
different situation
um here's another one um there was this
one doctor
who early on in the pandemic went on joe
rogan's show and said masks don't work
okay but that one doctor
failed to convince all of the top
medical professionals
in every industrial country and in every
state
in the united states so
why did none of these entities agree
with that one doctor who was on joe
rogan
and why would you why would you say well
every single state
in the country of the united states and
every industrialized country
are all on exactly the same side the
masks do make a difference
now somebody said what about sweden
no mask requirement well first of all a
lot of people did wear masks in sweden
on their own secondly the reason they
didn't have the requirement had nothing
to do with whether masks
work it was unrelated to that it was
more of a
social economic decision right
so that's a bad argument again
i'm not saying masks work or don't work
that's irrelevant to what i'm talking
about
i'm only asking i'm only talking about
whether your
argument made sense not not the outcome
here's another one there was a
meta-analysis
saying they don't work do you believe
that
do you believe that there was a
meta-analysis showing that masks
don't work for covid well i wouldn't
believe one if there was one
and again why is it that this twitter
user knows there was this meta-analysis
but nobody in charge
knows about this it's a bad argument
so the thing is why don't any of the
professionals agree with you
in all of the major countries what makes
you so smart and them so dumb
all right one point is that it would be
career suicide to disagree
but yet i see plenty of professionals
who disagree on climate change
isn't climate change would be career
suicide
but yet you could probably name several
skeptics who are notable scientists
who disagree right now i'm not saying
who's right
i'm saying that in every other topic
there are notable people who disagree
but not on masks
what's up with that how do you explain
that is it really just people protecting
themselves well here's what you should
ask
and i asked this on twitter but i
haven't seen all the answers when
initially when fauci the who and the cdc
said masks definitely don't work was
there any medical professional
in any country or state who disagreed
publicly do a fact check me on this
when when the expert said masks don't
work
did all of the experts agree with them
and then
with no change in data when fouchy said
oops i was lying masks definitely are
useful you should wear them
did all of the experts in all of the
countries and all the states
did they originally completely agree
with fauci that they don't work
and then with no change in data
did they all change to they do work
did that happen because if that did
happen
then the argument that it's just people
covering their ass
is solid wouldn't you say
so so if you if you stayed with me this
long
i'm showing you that there is a good
argument on your side
the the anti-mass people that would be
the good argument
if it's true i need a fact check on it
but it looks like it might have been
true
it feels like it's true but again fact
check me on this
if if all the experts simply went lock
step
to a reverse position with no change in
the data
then yes you could say that the medical
experts cannot be even listened to
you wouldn't give them any credibility
even if they were unanimous
all over the world right
i mean that's what i would look for but
if it's
but what if we find and i think we might
find that there were plenty of people
who said um
i hear what you're saying dr fauci but
i'm not quite there was that this
situation
because here's my memory of it my memory
of it is that when fauci
the cdc the surgeon general and
who all said masks are not useful
i believe i was the only public figure
saying that was
could i be wrong of course of course i
could be wrong
easily i mean what i'm no medical expert
but i did call it out uh in public and i
believe i'm the first in the country
who is a public figure who said that
but i don't remember if any medical
experts were agreeing with me at the
time
i don't recall any of them actually
so that's why you should ask yourself
one person noted that he or she has been
in and out of hospitals during the
pandemic
and that if you talk to the doctors the
doctors will say
not all of the doctors will say masks
are a good idea
so if your personal doctor
when they're not being you know judged
in public
when you have a personal conversation
with a doctor
are there doctors who are qualified to
make a decision on masks do they tell
you that they're not a good idea
wait a minute it's a trick what does it
mean to be not a good idea
when you say mass are not a good idea
you're throwing in all the social
economic
psychological parts of it
that's not a medical strictly a medical
question
so this isn't a good idea no matter how
many individual doctors
say masks are not a good idea
does not tell you anything about whether
masks
stop infections it's a different
question
it could be that they do stop a little
bit of infection but a doctor still
doesn't think
it's a good idea right it's a different
cut
different topic all right
so that's my take on this
so if you want a good argument the good
argument
is that the experts change their
opinions completely
without any change in data therefore
don't listen to them
that's not a bad argument but the
argument about the
the fleas going through the the fence
not a good argument
etc um
yeah and somebody's talking about the
cause of death
being coveted you know i can't get past
the fact
that we call we call the cause of death
the thing that happened last because the
thing that happened last
i'm not sure that's the cause right if a
a bubble boy leaves a bubble and catches
a cold and dies
was the cause of death the cold
or is the cause of death that you were
born a bubble boy and
the world was going to kill you if you
left your bubble
so the the cause of death stuff is
irrational the way we count it but
probably we have to count it anyway
you know we sort of have to how many of
you can tell me the number of people who
died
of covid in the united states yesterday
in the comments how many of you know the
answer to that
because i feel that during the height of
the pandemic
i could have told you about how many
people were dying every day
you know in january february wasn't it
three four thousand a day
three hundred and fifty i'm uh well your
numbers are all over the place 78
zero it's not a zero maybe a dozen
few hundred somebody's saying somebody's
saying 300.
now let me ask you this
so we don't know so why is it we don't
know when the number gets smaller
it's not reported still news right
if the number were 10 that would be
pretty big news
but i don't know what it is few hundred
now let me ask you this
given the imprecision of
measuring what is the cova death versus
somebody who was old
and was going to die anyway given that
imprecision
when you get down to a certain number of
cova deaths
isn't it going to match exactly the
level of uncertainty about
who died at all like you know aren't we
very close to the point
where it's you could say it's
effectively zero
because if it's a few dozen that's
exactly how many you would
you would list incorrectly right your
your error rate would be about the same
as the reported number
and what happens when the regular
seasonal flu
allegedly starts killing people
in the fall are we going to know that it
was just the regular flu that killed
somebody
or are we going to know it was a coveted
death will they test every 86 year old
who dies of a flu
will they say we better check to see if
that's a covened one or a regular
seasonal flu
i don't think so not all the time
saginaw says in your estimation what
percentage point does it take for
someone to change their behavior
on any health issue i don't think it's a
percentage
question as in what percentage of
doctors etc
i think people make a decision and then
just stick with it no matter what the
data does
so all evidence about how humans act
suggests that we don't really use data
you know we might use it initially
without even knowing if the data is
right
but then once we commit to a position we
just don't change
very few people who are anti-mask
would ever change their opinion no
matter what kind of research came
afterwards i don't think anybody would
he who shouldn't be named was talking
about hydroxychloroquine last night
was that trump um
yeah we're going to see what happens
this uh this winter
and i'm still amazed that we've gone
this far into a pandemic
without knowing what causes viruses to
go away in the summer
we actually don't even know that
how much do we know
so trump is on a rumble now
oh is that the uh did he make an
announcement that he was moving to
rumble i thought he was already there no
maybe was that the big announcement he
was talking about that he's
going to put his content on rumble
i'll have to look into that so i'm just
seeing some comments but i don't know
the
don't know the details
all right and let me ask you this how
many things have our experts
gotten right this year
um how many
oh he just joined so somebody's telling
me trump just joined rumble
well that's not a big surprise because i
think don jr's been there for a while
and that makes sense
all right well if trump's on rumble i've
got a rumble account too
so i'm going to give that a good look
um don't trust experts all right so
experts
definitely lied to us about masks we
know that
because they changed their view from
node yes so one of those was a lie we
don't know which one
i suppose you don't know which one they
what else did they lie about i'm pretty
sure they're lying about a seasonal flu
if you want daniel says if i want a
complete genetic report
oh you could you can provide it for free
and you're on locals
a genetic report about my ability to
sleep
that's interesting i don't think i need
that genetic
report because it's just so obvious in
my case that
i'm genetically inclined toward not
sleeping a lot
i don't think i even need to test that
so you're saying the experts might have
been wrong about hydroxychloroquine
i don't know about that i'm not ready to
make that claim
uh you probably think the experts were
wrong about ivermectin again
possibly but i'm not the expert who's
going to tell you they got that wrong
i don't have that qualification
oh about the wuhan lab being the source
of the
the outbreak they were probably wrong
about that
somebody says they're wrong about the
death rate of covid
i don't know well let me ask you this
during the beginning of the pandemic
there were quite a few people who said
it's a fake uh fake pandemic
but now we we have at least the number
of what 580
000 people allegedly died in this
country alone from covid
are you convinced that it was real or do
you think over half a million deaths
were
coded wrong or do you think
that if you added up all the deaths and
translated them into years of life
that are taken away because most of the
deaths were you know
over 70 over 80. they didn't have many
years of life left
if you were to say okay the average life
is 77 years or whatever it is in this
country and you added up all the the
years
lost from the the seniors who were dead
and then you translated that back into
you know one person equals 75 years
how many people would that be does your
over half a million people if you just
translate it into
life years of 77 a piece would it turn
out to be 100
000 50 000
like how small would that get because i
think if you're over 80 your life
expectancy is maybe what three years
so so three into
75 you know uh
so i think you end up getting fewer than
a hundred thousand
lifetimes were lost equivalent lifetimes
uh somebody says their grand grandma
died at 94 during the pandemic
and if and if the death rate changes
completely
now here's the big question so if the
first thing you do is translate into
years lost it looks like a lot less of a
problem
but secondly what's going to happen next
year if next year
we have an unusually low count of deaths
from viruses
or an unusually low death count in
general because it took out
so many of the people who are close to
death this year
that they won't slop into the next year
to die
don't you have to subtract them to find
out the net
deaths of covent so i have a feeling
if you were honest about the death count
and you translated it to a number of
years and then you counted the second
year where maybe the death count will be
unusually low because because people
died the year before
i could be under 100 000 you know
equivalent deaths
which would get it somewhere pretty
close to a normal seasonal flu
problem now of course it was still would
have overrun the hospitals
and you still have the long-haul risk
and we still don't know how to get rid
of it
so i'm not saying we should have
necessarily done anything differently
but data can be manipulated quite a bit
in this case
somebody says the experts were wrong on
lockdowns
were they i don't know that they were
wrong on lockdowns i believe that
you can find a lot of smart people who
say that the
lockdowns worked but
i think that there's a big difference
between a lockdown
and a well-executed lockdown and when
you're looking at them we kind of throw
those all together and say well it's all
it's all lockdowns but wouldn't there be
a big difference between let's say
a sweden lockdown in which people just
did
social distancing largely voluntarily uh
for and they didn't do big gatherings
etc so that
sweden had a lockdown it just was
a little more permissive and then
california had a lockdown which was
probably
way too strict you know a lot of
businesses clothes that didn't need to
so i'm not sure you can take you know
the
the permissive lockdown and match it
with the non-permissive one
one might have been short one might have
been long i don't know if you could
average that stuff
do you think social distancing didn't
work
social distancing is the one thing that
had to work
it had to now it didn't stop anything
but it certainly had to slow it down i
don't think if you're arguing about
social distancing working that's a crazy
argument
because viruses do have a distance limit
china has no covet somebody says well
is that true i i heard that they were
having some
outbreaks recently
and how does how does china not have a
huge major outbreak again i don't
understand what's going on over there
all right china's own vaccines
china is using therapeutics somebody
says that's possible
i mean we're using the therapeutics too
maybe different ones
uh patrick says on your anecdotal
evidence of your allergy subsiding
fauci's organization name national
institute of allergy and infectious
disease
allergy and infectious disease patrick
esquire good catch yeah
so i'm certainly not going to make a
claim that my allergies went away
because i got the vaccination
it's just that after the vaccination
my allergies went away i don't know why
i can't tell you why never happened
before
and i just put that out there as a
single data point
um have i read norm mcdonald's novel i
didn't know norm had a novel
but that's interesting i like everything
norm mcdonald does so i'd probably like
his novel
fake is hyperbole for change yeah okay
then there's questions about the pcr
test etc
all right um david says
please talk to brett weinstein about
covet stuff
why why what good would that do
i i appreciate the suggestion but
but think this through um if you're
familiar with uh brett weinstein's
content
yeah what would what would i add
to that because what what brett adds
is a rational look
at the topic would i be adding an
irrational look like what would i add
because i think my approach and his
approach to
let's say analysis would be basically
identical wouldn't it
and and if he and i disagreed on what's
the
logical way to look at something he'd
probably
just change my mind so you would just
get more br
brett and i i wouldn't add anything
the big the big trap that i warn you
against
is thinking that you watched a podcast
and learn something
that doesn't happen watching a podcast
of one expert or two experts who are on
the same side
saying what they think is true is almost
certainly bad
information even if the expert's right
because there's somebody who's got
different contexts different point of
view
and you kind of need to hear it to know
that you're hearing something good
so my problem with the the news model
and the podcast
interview model is that they're either
one side without context
completely misleading and useless and
you shouldn't pay attention to them too
much
or they try to put two battling people
on and it's just bickering and
you run at a time and nobody solves
anything
so you really have to watch yourself
believing that you learned something
because you watched the podcast
if you're watching joe rogan's material
tremendously entertaining you know high
value
to the audience which is of course why
he is successful
because he provides tremendous value to
the audience
but it's not science
it's somebody with an opinion talking to
another smart person who's getting their
opinion
you know uh out there it's not
that's not science it's good to hear and
and it's an addition to the conversation
every time
in my opinion so it's all good
but don't feel like you learned
something that that would be a trap
all right the most you learned is that
there is another point of view that's
that's what you can learn you can't
learn what's true
let's talk about white rage
is there white rage and if white rage
exists
doesn't it apply to antifa
isn't antifa mostly white rage
and isn't black lives matter
mostly white rage now you say
to yourself but scott the black lives
matter are
black citizens so how could black
citizens have
white rage do the numbers
how many people who protested in favor
of black lives matter were white
and were outraged a lot
probably more than the number of black
people just because of the
percentages of people in the country
there were i'm guessing
do a fact check on this if you were to
look at the crowds
marching for black lives matter weren't
most of them non-black
and i would think that they looked
pretty mad looked like they had a lot of
rage
so white rage is like just being white
have you met any large groups of white
people who didn't have rage about
something
you know if you see a bunch of lgbtq
people protesting most of them are going
to be white
and they might be outraged about
something
i don't know any group of white people
that you can put together and they're
not outraged about something
you got your cairns and your anti-fuzz
and
yeah so white rage is real
except that it's universal if you're
imagining that the only ones who have it
are
you know some white supremacist or
something
i think you're missing the point of
white people we're outraged at
everything
we need to unify the country and focus
on uh all american rage
you know the the only reason that people
are not unified
is that leaders don't want us to be
unity takes away your power if you're a
leader
if if you want to be a leader to your
community
and you got everything you wanted what
happens to your job
right unity is the last thing you want
if you're a leader it's only something
that
you know the citizens want sometimes
but there's definitely no leaders that
want unity
it's not a white thing it's a people
thing yeah yeah
white rage uh i'm joking about it
but is there some community that doesn't
have rage when they've got a good reason
for it
i don't think so i think people get
outraged very easily
you're confusing leaders with
politicians no i'm not
when i say leaders i'm talking about
leaders of
antifa well i guess that doesn't count
leaders of black lives matter
leaders of any organization they don't
have to be politicians
um you want me to live stream my e-bike
ride
i might do that i might do that i was
just
trying to figure out a good way to
attach a camera because the last time i
attached my
phone to my e-bike the holder was not
good and my phone ended up
many miles on the from me on the road
but i got it back all right
that is all i got for now it's a slow
news day
and i will talk to you oh wait one more
question from dean
what are your thoughts on the next two
years in regards to the economy
lots predicted crash
i feel as if we're at a point where all
of our crashes are temporary
meaning that if you had bought stock
during the 2009
meltdown you would have made a lot of
money
if i didn't buy stock if you
bought stock during the pandemic
meltdown you would have made a lot of
money and
in that case i did because i learned
from 2009
and i said to myself i'm not going to
miss this one and i just
went all in on stocks and that turned
out to be the best
decision i ever made
have i ever heard of ultra white um
kind of paint uh no
i haven't do i still have the pope hat
of course i do
yeah inflation is going to be a problem
we just don't know how big so
there's something about the economy in
the modern era
that doesn't seem stoppable i feel that
i feel that a depression happens when
lots of things get broken and also you
can't communicate well to fix it
i feel like you don't get a depression
if people can communicate and move
resources where they need to go
and that sort of thing so i think we're
somewhat protected against the biggest
downside
but a 10 to 20 pullback 10 to 20
pullback of the stock market yeah
you know that's going to happen might
happen this year it might happen next
year might happen in five years
but 10 to 20 pullbacks are just routine
that you can't not have them and when
they happen buy stock
that's my that's my non-advice
all right that's it for now i'll talk to
you tomorrow
