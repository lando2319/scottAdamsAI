hey everybody
come on in come on in
it's time for coffee with scott adams
best time of the day
for most of you and if you'd like to
enjoy it
to its fullest extent i mean really
really enjoy it all you need is a copper
mug or a glass a tanker jealousy stein a
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything except
solar wind software better it's called
the simultaneous it happens now
go
somebody says where is youtube uh
youtube is live
it's live at the same time
so uh i hope your week is going better
than mine
uh if if i seem a little down
i'm not having the best week to say the
least
but i'm gonna try to raise my
spirits for you so there's a story that
there's a filter that's made for
astronaut
urine that could soon be providing
drinking water to earth
that was the headline in cnn so it's
some kind of a
amazing filter that you can put urine
into it
astronauts have been using it and it
just turns it into clean drinking water
um but i have some questions
when it rains will you be able to tell
how much is the regular rain
and how much is coming from the
international space station if you know
what i mean
i feel like we need to know that um
sweden has uh disappointed us quite a
bit
poor little sweden early on in the
coronavirus
seemed to be some kind of a weird
exception that made it look as though
all of our worst
fears were exaggerated
because sweden didn't lock down as
aggressively as other places and
even though their death rate was high
they seemed to have gotten through
the first wave not too badly
but it turns out that the second wave
not so good and sweden is getting
crushed
in terms of rate of infections compared
to europe
so can we say now
that sweden was a mistake is
it are we at a point where even the
skeptics will say
okay lockdowns work
and okay i guess the
i guess the social distancing and the
masks might make a difference
i'm looking at the comments not yet
we're not ready to
not ready to you're not ready to cave on
that yet
well how about the fact that nearly 300
000 americans
will die from coronavirus are you
willing to give me that it's not just
the flu
anybody anybody who thought it was just
the flu
any revised opinions after 300 000
people dead
or are you still on the view that they
were all misdiagnosed
and they died of something else well we
know that the
if you've seen around on twitter there
were some
tweets going around saying that the net
death rate was actually down
and it turns out that the way you arrive
at that
at that conclusion that the net death
rate is down
is by using the wrong data in the wrong
way
but if you don't do that the death
rate's way up
and it's coronavirus but you've probably
seen that tweet
did not pass the fact-checking took
about a minute to get debunked
um president-elect
joe biden gave a speech was there
anybody dumb enough to watch it
imagine the last time you heard you know
president trump was going to give a
speech
didn't you automatically say to yourself
oh i wonder where i'll be
maybe i'll maybe i'll listen to that it
could be interesting
but what did you say when you heard that
biden was going to give a speech
did you say to yourself well that's a
that's appointment tv
i'd better set my alarm i better get
over there and listen to that
well i do this every day talk about
politics and even i couldn't get
interested in his speech
i thought well if anything happens i'll
see it on the
highlight clip but apparently one of the
things that happened is he was clearing
his throat a lot and he said that he's
battling a slight cold
uh now does that sound true in the
in the age of uh coronavirus
and in the age of everything else
well let me ask you this uh joe biden
has been
socially distancing and wearing masks
how did he get a cold where'd the cold
come from
i might i mean i'm just kidding but if
he was really socially distancing
does jill biden have a cold because if
he didn't get it from jill biden
what's he doing when we're not watching
maybe he only goes down into the
basement for his videos
i don't know but i'm glad he doesn't
have coronavirus but
how do you catch anything if you're
socially distancing
you'd have to work at it i think but he
pulled it off
and uh when i say that joe biden has a
bit of a cold i mean
possibly dying same thing
you you give a guy that age a a
bit of a cold you know start writing the
obituary
because he's at that age where he could
be taken out by
normal respiratory problems but
we hope it's just a cold quite a
coincidence
he has a he has a raspy throat during a
coronavirus situation
i gotta say i don't know i've met
anybody who's had a cold since the
coronavirus started
let me ask you have you seen a lot of
colds
in your house since the coronavirus
started
i believe i haven't seen any
i've seen some allergies
yeah somebody says you got it from
sniffing hair
in the big news you may have heard that
pornhub
is deleting all of its unverified
content
i think the idea there is that they're
cracking down on sex trafficking and
underage stuff so there's probably a
good base for that but
there was a tweet on this topic from
steve hassan
phd and he's an expert on cults
he writes books on cults and he said
this
about pornhub he says i hope they are
deleting all hypnosis videos
what i watched two videos
says steve hassan to convince people
they were
they were another gender what i saw was
highly sophisticated mind control
d transitioners pointed me to them so
according to steve
there are videos on pornhub or
unless they've been taken down that
would convince people they were another
gender
do you think now the first the first
thing you have to ask is
steve hassan is an expert he's written
books he's a phd
written books on cults and cult
indoctrination
and getting out of cults but is he a
hypnotist
yes i don't know i don't believe he's a
trained hypnotist
but i am so
if i were wondering about this question
i would ask me
is that possible can you change
somebody's
gender with hypnosis and if you could
could you put it in a video and put it
online and it just
changes people's genders the answer to
that is
nope no you know you can't
you can't change people's gender or in
other words you can't change people's
mind about what their gender is
that's not a thing what you can do is if
somebody was
interested in doing that those videos
would probably make a difference
but you have to start out wanting to do
it you know nobody
nobody wanders into the site and says
hey i wonder what this is
let's let me click on this and just
sample a few minutes i'm just curious i
certainly don't want to change my
i am now a woman okay
that's not happening but it is true
that people who might want to fantasize
about that or
make it happen anyway those videos might
make a difference
but no you will not be accidentally
hypnotized
to be another gender
let me say that with complete certainty
that's not a thing
now you can change people's preferences
so if they wanted to indulge in this
content they could
change their preference and then
anything's possible but
the the nuance of knowing that it can't
change you unless you wanted that change
is pretty important
all right uh i saw online that the new
york times has not covered the
story of uh representative swalwell and
the
uh the alleged chinese spy that he
allegedly had a close relationship with
and i'm thinking to myself how in the
world
does the new york times just not cover
it maybe that's
it could be not true so somebody might
fact check that and say oh they covered
it
so i guess i shouldn't assume that's
true just because i saw it on twitter
um here's something you don't see in the
news
what is the thing that's most holding up
the
coronavirus relief kind of packages in
congress
and the answer is it's over the biggest
issue seems to be the question
of whether businesses would receive some
protection from being sued
should they not do things right with
coronavirus
the democrats want to change nothing and
allow people to be sued the republicans
say
you can't ask people to open up business
in a pandemic
at the same time they can be sued if
anybody gets a virus
so here's what's missing
where are the news programs where people
who understand both sides of that issue
just the liability issue where are the
news programs where those people are on
and they're being interviewed and the
and the person interviewing them
let's say on cnn or even fox here's the
argument
because i keep waiting to hear the
argument i have a bias
because i used to own small businesses
so my bias is i'd like to see protection
so they can't get sued to me it makes
perfect sense
but if there's some gigantic problem
with that
that's holding things up my question is
this
why are we not seeing that debate why
are we just
we're just saying it exists well that's
what's happening
congress is having that debate it exists
that they disagree
i feel like we need to get involved with
this right
are you telling me that the public
should not be pushing congress for this
because here's the problem i don't think
congress is the right entity
to make that decision congress is the
right entity to make lots of decisions
it's designed that way
but when it comes down to this question
of personal risk
i just don't know that congress can do
it because they don't want to make a
mistake
right so it's a situation where
whichever way you go it's going to be a
mistake
if you say that the small businesses are
protected
it's going to look like a mistake
because sooner or later somebody's going
to do something so egregious
that you wish they had been sued but if
you go the other way and say
all right you can sue it's gonna happen
and then small businesses will be put
out of business for
largely things that they probably
couldn't control so you've got two ways
to lose
and there are only two options so how
can we expect congress
who needs to get reelected to sign up
for either thing
either to keep it the way it is or to
sign up and put their name on changing
it
because both of those things could cost
them their job
so it turns out the congress is just the
worst tool for this decision
but the public isn't the public if we
had a
let's say a 75 opinion that
businesses should be uh you know held uh
faultless i think congress would have to
do it right
so have you seen any polls on whether
whether congress should go with the
limiting the liability or not have you
seen a poll on that
i don't know if there have been polls on
that but i haven't seen one
wouldn't you like to know if 75 of the
country was on one side or the other
because if 75 of the country is on one
side i don't know which side it would be
actually then we should be pushing
congress to just
do what we need them to do instead of
having them try to make that decision
never work um
so amazon turns out they bought a
startup with a
self-driving car i don't know why
amazon's getting into these self-driving
car business but i'm sure it's
strategically smart because they tend to
be and
this one's different because it won't
have steering wheels and it won't have
any way for a human being to
control it it'll just be a pure
self-driving
driving car so if it goes where it's not
supposed to be
you can't take the steering wheel it
would be like a taxi
uh the company name is zoox zoox
and here's what's interesting about this
if you told me that amazon should stay
under the hardware business
i would have said yes about that i would
have said yeah
amazon stick to your selling stuff
online you're pretty good at that
but then they invented their digital
assistant
the a-l-e-x-a that i won't say out loud
because i
have them in the house that piece of
hardware
impresses me every single day it is
sensational
compared to let's say uh s-i-r-i
on your phone that's just sort of a
i don't know a novelty or a toy
but amazon's version of the digital
assistant
and maybe google's too i haven't used
that but amazon's version
is really really good so much so it's
like having a
star trek computer in your home i talk
to it all day long
i order things through it it's it's
transformational so if you tell me that
amazon isn't the right company to make
a self-driving car i say to you
they might be they might be i mean i
wouldn't bet against them
after seeing the alexa
and maybe their play here is that if the
car is self-driving
you need to do something while the car
is moving and what are you going to do
while the car is doing its thing well
you're going to read
right you're going to look at some
content you're going to watch a movie
maybe you get it from amazon
so there's probably some way for them to
tie this
car to their service and this is why i
predict
that inevitably you're going to see
these big companies
building homes because if a big company
such as an apple or google
could build a home and they only catch
let's say it's free they'll build you a
home and it doesn't even cost you
anything it's just free
and the only catch is that all of the
services that support the home
have to be bought from them so you'd
have to get your
your energy from your wi-fi your
insurance maybe
you know so you just have to get all
your services from whoever gave you the
shell of a home
and then they could give it to you for
free and i think that might be what's
happening with this
taxi thing uh rasmussen is reporting
they did a survey and they found the 52
percent of
likely u.s voters think that many news
organizations
ignored the hunter biden's story to help
his father's campaign
so that's over half of the likely voters
believe that the media rigged the vote
by what what coverage they they did
especially on the hunter buying thing
over half of the country thinks
that the media rigged the election think
about that
um and only 32 percent disagree with
that
so here's a uh i don't know if this is
new or a story or not but a bipartisan
and that the bipartisan part is
important
energy package uh just got attached to
the omnibus
spending bill so omnibus means it's
a big comprehensive spending bill and
they attach to it this little energy
package
that has provisions to boost and here's
the fun part
i'm just quoting from this tweet to
boost green
technologies such as advanced
nuclear power so with no
no caveats people are talking about
green technology being advanced nuclear
power
so the administration uh is putting this
in the bill that will probably get
passed
and they're also looking at energy
storage and carbon capture
now if you read my book loser think you
know that carbon capture is
a big deal and there are a whole bunch
of ways to do it where you can turn it
into products and
and goods so you don't just capture and
bury it you can capture it
and use it in a variety of ways so it
feels as though
the trump administration assuming trump
is still there to
sign off on this thing uh was doing
maybe some good stuff
on advanced nuclear power at least
funding the research and maybe biden
will do more of it but it looks like
here's the biggest news in the world
the biggest news in the world is that
you can write a tweet and say green
technology
such as advanced nuclear power you can
you can write that sentence in a tweet
in public green technologies such as
advanced nuclear power and people will
just read it and go yeah that sounds
about right
do you know how big a deal that is that
that's that's the bigger deal than
anything in the news today
you know even if our elections were
stolen and
i don't know this is like the biggest
deal in the world because the
climate change green new deal thing even
if you don't think it's
exactly as scary as the proponents of
that if you do
you'd have to admit it's a gigantic
issue
whatever you think of it it's gigantic
it's going to determine the fate of the
earth
etc now the biggest
problem looks like it's solved
the biggest problem was psychological
simply simply understanding that
advanced nuclear energy was a green
technology
and and what else
it's a green neck nuclear technology and
the only technology that a lot of smart
people say
could do anything about climate change
in the long run
because the other the other technologies
have their hiccups and problems and
limitations
it's a big deal all right
um i would say the most impressive thing
about our election system
is how amazingly poorly designed it is
because think about a system where the
system
you know by its nature is subject to
massive different ways to do fraud
so it's not even like there's just one
way to do it there might be
a dozen or 25 different ways to
to cheat in an election so you've got a
system that's like
amazingly transparent i'm sorry
it's amazingly go it's got holes in it
everywhere
so it would be easy to cheat if that's
what you wanted to do you might get
caught
but it would be easy to do the cheating
and
at the same time we have a system
which guarantees there'll never be
enough time
to look into any allegations of cheating
so this is by design you know our system
including the constitution and all the
ways we vote these are systems
and by design this is the the freaky
part
it's not an accident but meaning that we
know we did it it's
it's an accidental outcome but we
designed it
and it's doing exactly what anybody who
looked at this design would say oh yeah
that's
that's guaranteed to happen and here's
here's what it is we're guaranteed to
have fraud
because there are so many ways it's
possible and the the upside potential
for getting away with cheating on
election is gigantic
so if you have a situation where it's
possible and the upside potential is
through
the roof it's going to happen every time
guaranteed
but normally you'd still be okay
because eventually you're going to catch
it and once you catch it
the people who might do it next time are
going to say wow
they always catch this why would i do it
again
but we've designed a system with a
compressed window
and our courts don't want to get
involved because our system
keeps the courts a little bit of a
distance from what
the states want to do in their own state
so you don't really have a court that's
designed to handle the problem
you don't have a timeline that's long
enough for the judicial
system to handle it and produce a
penalty that would make a difference for
the next time and it's guaranteed fraud
it's really a perfect design
if you didn't want to have a fair
election
let me say it in a different way if you
were going to start from scratch
to design a system that is guaranteed to
have a massive fraud guaranteed
no way around it guaranteed how would
you design it
just like this you'd make it complicated
you'd make sure that there were not lots
of
uh there were a lot not lots of ways
that
you could be detected if you cheated and
you would make sure that
uh it's not transparent so you don't
have witnesses and all the different
places that you could cheat
and then you'd make sure that there wer
there was not enough time
to find fraud that's how you design it
you would make it like that from scratch
exactly like the system we have it's
designed
maybe accidentally but i'll say the
design is such that
the fraud is essentially guaranteed by
the design
you couldn't not have it um
jim cramer of cnbc you all know jim
craver
kramer mad money and i guess he's gonna
have a guest on his show
or if unless it already happened michael
mina
who is the biggest name talking about
these rapid cheap
coronavirus tests the part that the
public
and maybe the government fails to
understand
is how less sensitive tests
or less specific tests could get you a
better result
than more accurate tests and the reason
that people can't understand it
is that people are not good with
statistics and probability
and risk management right we're just not
good at it
so if i say to you why don't we
introduce these tests
they're less less accurate than the
other tests we already have
you're kind of done with the
conversation aren't you
we have good tests and you're saying
you'd like to introduce some tests that
would be widespread
and not accurate isn't that the worst of
everything it's widespread
and not accurate i mean i what could be
worse than that
and the answer is you don't understand
risk management
or statistics or decision making if
that's your view
because here's the real the real reason
that the less
sensitive tests are the way to go you
could you could test yourself every day
if it misses it once it picks it up the
next day
you spent uh five dollars instead of two
dollars and fifty cents people who
wanted to test could do as much as they
want
eighty percent of the t at the time
they'd get the right result
although i've heard some rapid tests
that might be in the
high 90s accuracy don't know about that
yet
and the point is if you have enough
inaccurate tests
it's way better than having not enough
wait three days for your response
accurate tests
now why is it and this is the mystery
that i've been
uh wondering why is it that the
administration has
not they of course know about the idea
because i i can i can vouch for the fact
that the idea has reached
the administration i guarantee that so
they've heard the idea
what they haven't done is said we don't
like the idea because of x
apparently the fda has some problem with
these tests
that i don't quite understand maybe has
something to do with reporting
requirements etc
not not a good reason uh but
if the government knows about these
tests what are the
two possible reasons that they are not
implementing them number one that this
harvard trained expert and all the
people he's talked to
are wrong about their thinking
that would be one reason not to do it
right that michael meena is just wrong
he's thought of it wrong he did the risk
management wrong
he's not wrong about how accurate the
tests are or how much they would cost
but one reason not to do it is he got
something wrong
what is it that we haven't even seen a
counter argument there's never
to to my understanding there has never
been
a counter-argument there are simply
people who don't understand it
now here's the powerful part of this jim
cramer
is not normal people the reason he has
this gigantically successful show is
that jim cramer has a special skill
that he brings to the show which is risk
management
statistical understanding on top of you
know lots of financial and tv
things he's got an amazing talent stack
but a big part of the telestack
is that he can look at a complicated
situation with lots of risks and
possibilities and he can analyze that
better than you can
that's why you watch him for his stock
picks
and i think he's probably the exact
right person
on the exact right topic because if
you're in the administration and you see
michael meena talking by himself you
might say to yourself well i don't know
nobody's mentioning it lately
maybe it's not a thing but if you see
jim cramer talk
to him and endorse it i don't know if he
will but let's say he does
you'd say to yourself oh i don't know
much about michael mina
but i've been watching jim cramer
forever and if he says this is the way
to go
logically just common sense logically
risk management statistically if he says
this makes sense
suddenly i take it seriously so
there might be something very important
happening here it has to do with the
fact that
cramer can put a seal of uh credibility
on
exactly this kind of thing even though
he's not a medical guy
because it's not really a medical
question ultimately
so we'll see if that makes a difference
i don't know maybe he's already been on
the show could have already happened
um let's see let's talk about the great
reset
i i didn't want to do it but i decided
to google it this morning
and look into it and the great reset is
basically
two words for what people already wanted
to do
and what what people already wanted to
do and of course
not all people but the people who use
this phrase
what a lot of people wanted to do
globally not just in this country
is have more socialism
so if i could simplify the great reset
it is
hey let's introduce more socialism
in more countries the idea being to help
the people at the bottom strata
that might require taking money from the
richest
but there are a number of ways to do the
great reset the the details of the great
reset are less important
than the fact that the people who want
more socialism
are saying hey let's use this as
a this crisis as an opportunity
now there are two things that they want
to use as their opportunity
hey it's a coronavirus let's do more
socialism
but also hey it's a climate change
let's do more socialism
now the uh the coronavirus
did cause more socialism in the united
states right we just printed money and
started sending it out so that's as
socialist as you can get uh in my
opinion
but let me ask you this if you take away
the words
great reset just the words what's
different
do you think that the people who wanted
socialism were not looking for
every excuse to say well we got a solar
flare
so i think we need more socialism
we looks like there's going to be a war
so a little more socialism
it's going to be a virus how about some
more socialism
climate change i want a little socialism
so i don't think there's anything
different
it's just a word put to what people
wanted
now is it true that the coronavirus will
accelerate that yeah
because it happened already we saw
people just checks being mailed out
and people getting free healthcare at
least in part
free free vaccinations so yeah
we're way more socialist than we were a
year ago
so saying that there's something that
will cause more socialism
is different from saying i've got a plan
watch me release this virus so i can
have some socialism
but it's not really the socialism i want
it's really the power
but here's the problem with the theory
that the real point of the great reset
is power yes socialism consolidates
power
it does have that element to it it gives
the government more power
but for whom
if there were somebody running for
office
and also wanted the great reset you
could say ah they're saying it because
if that great reset happens
you know they're going to get elected
because they're associated with it
but how would klaus schwab
benefit from you know one of the guys
pushing the great reset
how would somebody who's not running for
the highest office
benefit yes there might be more control
but the people who would have the
control are not the people promoting it
so why are people promoting more control
for
other people that doesn't even make
sense
so if you if you dig even this much into
the great reset it looks like they're
just putting words on things that
are going to happen anyway because
society changes
all right
here's banzai sharma had a long tweet
thread that i
retweeted and you should look at it and
it starts out by saying the biggest real
problem with their voting system
is not only that we've got these voting
machines in uh in almost all of our
states
but with relatively few exceptions i
guess
but we have a system that's not only
universally you know similar in states
but it rigorously defies a fraud
detection
i love that phrase our election system
rigorously defies fraud detection it
does
it looks like it was designed to
not show you the fraud if it happened it
looks like it was built that way
it's so bad yeah but
here's some things going on the georgia
secretary of state announced that an
audit of voter signatures
on absentee ballot ballots will happen
in cobb county
now of course everybody said why cobb
county that's not the bad one
why don't you do the ballot count in a
county that
there are allegations there were there
was misbehavior
i don't know if cobb county was even the
one one of the ones somebody had a
question about
but anyway so all they're going to do is
check signatures
i assume they'll find some amount of
fraud i assume
that they won't be able to prove how
much it is because they're only looking
at a sample
and therefore you can't always
generalize that sample and therefore the
courts will say
so what yeah you found you found a bunch
of fraud
so the courts don't care
so does it matter that there's going to
be an audit of voter signatures i mean
maybe for your curiosity
but whatever all right here's the good
story it's the one you're waiting for
there was a forensic audit
of dominion voting machines in michigan
in one county
and uh here's the result of the audit
all right now i'm just reporting
a reporting what i heard okay
that's it i'm just reporting it uh
remind me to talk about patrick byrne in
a minute somebody's
somebody's prompting me so what they
find is that
68 of the votes that went through the
voting machine
went to adjudication so that means that
they
they feed a bunch of votes into the
machine
and 68 of them were bounced as it needs
a person to review them
68 percent do you know what is the
allowed
error way less than one percent
so the amount that would be acceptable
given that nothing is perfect
by contract way less than one percent
would be
acceptable they had 68
way way less than one percent not even
close to one percent
they had 68 percent okay
68 allegedly all right we'll get to that
now what happens when a ballot is
adjudicated well
we found out because we saw a video on
it so what happens is a separate machine
lights up if something was not
proper in the vote counting and then you
can see the ballot
and it comes up and the operator can put
anything they want on that ballot
yeah i really said that the operator who
sees the adjudicated ballots the ones
that have some question about what the
voter intended
all of those votes go to somebody who
sits at another computer
a separate computer it comes up on
screen
and then they can change the votes to
whatever they want
and nobody's watching just whatever they
want
so they could take all 68 of those votes
just change of all the biden and do you
know uh
how easy it would be to get away with it
it's 100 easy nobody's watching
and do you know what happens when they
look for the the logs
and so that they could look at the the
actual uh
the record of what happened in 2020
the 2020 log is missing oh they've got
the 2018 log still in the machine
oh yeah they have the 2016 log
still complete still in the machine only
the 2020 log was deleted and it was
deleted the day after the election
and every vote in there
that went through adjudication allegedly
was unmonitored now
these are the same machines that
allegedly are in widespread use
and one of the things that disappeared
with the
log that would have told you what
happened with this machine
was the indication of whether the
internet had connected to the machine
at any point so the thing that would
have told them
if the internet had ever been connected
to that machine at least during the
voting process
that log was missing wasn't missing in
2018
in fact it's still there right on the
disk
wasn't missing in 2016.
now what do you think about this
and then the the analyst who looks at it
he says that
this is not an error so it's not a bug
he said he can look at the code and he
can see that the code was written
to create 68 errors
it wasn't a mistake it's right there in
the code
to create the errors that aren't real
errors
so so let me say this
if this is true this is you know kraken
times 10
that's all you would need to know really
you wouldn't even need to know if it
happened
you would only need to know this is a
thing
if this is a thing that the adjudicators
are getting
tons of votes and nobody watches what
they
changed them to if that's real the
election is just garbage
but is it real is there anything about
this story
that you find unsettling so
turn on your your your skeptic mode now
right i know you
want to believe this is true you do
don't you
you want to believe this is the kraken
you want to believe this forensic
analyst
nailed it you want to believe badly if
you're
a trump supporter but just work with me
a little bit
and turn on your skeptical your
skeptical filter
and tell me is there anything wrong with
this story
for the sk there we go somebody somebody
nailed it
a little too on the nose
right a little bit too on the nose
the story is a little bit too good and
by a little bit too good i mean
way too good way too good
to be true
now that doesn't mean it's not true but
if you had to place a really big
bet on this one you should bet against
it
sorry that doesn't mean it's false
i can't tell i don't i don't really have
any independent way to know if it's true
or false
i'm just telling you that if you ever
hear a story
that sounds like this one and you don't
know anything yourself you've just heard
this story
if it sounds like this one
bet against it
like you i join you in saying i would
love to know
if this is true because if it is
there's one other tell here
that the analyst says the the code
is intentional do you think that
these voting systems would include
intentional code
that was obvious when you just looked at
it for fraud
or in this case obvious code for
creating adjudicated ballots for
no reason do you believe that that's
really there
that you could just look at the code and
you could see
a cheat code and you could tell their
intentions
just by looking at the code well maybe
maybe there's nothing that would rule
that out
that i'm aware of but
you've got a story that's really a
little too perfect
a little too perfect
and you've got somebody who might be
doing a little bit of mind reading
because you can tell what the code does
you can't tell the intention of the
person who wrote it
you think you can but you can't always
no you could be speculating correctly
it could be speculating that that's the
reason the code is there and maybe it is
maybe that's exactly why it's there but
i'll betcha
i'll betcha that when the
makers of this software respond they
will tell you a story of a reason that
that code exists
that will be plausible
probably now that doesn't mean their
plausible explanation is true
but i'll bet you're gonna hear a
plausible explanation i'll bet you will
so wait for that um we'd like this to be
true because it'd be fun but who knows
correct me if i'm wrong but as of this
morning google has not
told us what caused the massive outage
is that true
still true as of this time of day it was
true when i woke up
so i think if if google does not tell
you what caused their outage
you have to assume it's probably this
this hack this uh this
wind what is it uh solar solar wind
thing
here's a question for you i've read
stories that associated the hack with
china
but those were not you know credible and
now it sounds like the new york times
is saying that the hack is russian
does that feel a little bit convenient
that it's a russian hack here's my
question
is russia the only country that's good
at it
are you telling me that china isn't good
at hacking
because why is it that russia is the
only one who breaks through
it feels a little too
neat to me so
then here's the question how do we know
how do our intelligence people know
because that's who we're telling us so i
guess the us intelligence people are
saying they think it's russia
keep in mind that 50 uh us
past and present intelligence
professionals also said the hunter biden
story
was russian information i guess
i was informed that they didn't use the
word disinformation but they're saying
it's russian
information sort of assuming that
uh you know they're playing fast and
loose with what information means
do you believe that the same
intelligence agencies
who 50 of them believe that the hunter
biden
laptop story was russian information do
you believe that the same class of
people
can tell you who hacked who hacked the
software
i don't think that's a thing now if
there is a hacker out there who
who actually has experience like a real
you know super experienced hacker
who wants to disagree with me i will
listen to that
but i'm not going to listen to ordinary
people who don't know more than i do
which is not a lot about hacking tell me
that we can always tell where a hack
comes from because i don't think we can
i don't think that's a thing i think
that often you can tell
i wouldn't i wouldn't rule out the fact
that it's
you know there are times when you can
tell that seems reasonable
but are you telling me that russia
russia
or china you tell me they don't have the
ability to hide
the source of the hack i
i'm not a hacker but i don't believe
that things can't be hidden
it proved me wrong there's a story
out of great britain where unconscious
biased training is being scrapped
for civil servants so i guess in england
or just england i guess
you had to take unconscious bias
training to find out how much bias you
had that you didn't even know about
and apparently after doing it for a
while they decided uh
there is no evidence that this makes a
difference and there's a little bit of
evidence
that it makes things worse
so uh that's in england i don't know
that i don't think that's gonna happen
here
i think over here we'll be doing more of
this not less of it but
england decided to go without
uh scott why aren't you talking about
russell ramsland
jr remind me who russell ramsen was i
i did read him i think that's another
russell ramslund who is he
ramsa because i know that's a real story
that's
and i remember seeing it and ignoring it
oh that's a state official
oh he slams a report on the votes
so is he the one who did the uh
yeah i just talked about that why are
you asking me to talk about that i just
got done with that
oh patrick byrne so patrick byrne who
had been the ceo of overstock
he's no longer i think but he has a
story that the
fbi asked him to work on a sting
for a bribery of hillary clinton
the credibility you should put on that
story
is
zero zero unfortunately
patrick byrne has a credibility problem
yeah zero
now again people can be non-credible but
they can be right
sometimes so i'm not saying i'm not
saying it didn't happen
i'm just saying that if that's your only
source
zero zero
all right um talk about bar
you know i haven't talked a lot about
barr but i'll give you my
layperson's opinion i think he was great
honestly i was looking at the comments
from
democrats who were saying that he lied
to the country about the mueller report
to which i say did he
did he lie about the mueller report
because i don't think so
i think he handled the mueller report
just right
now did he should he told us more about
hunter biden's laptop before the
election
not if he's doing his job i feel like he
should not have told us that
even though i wanted to know even though
it would have changed the result
i feel like there are some lines that
you just don't cross
and that feels like one that should not
have been crossed
and i would respect him for not crossing
it
i respect him for being good with
working for the president
and uh if there are people not being
prosecuted for
i don't know the mueller report origins
or whatever it's probably because they
don't have the goods yet
so i don't have any problem with borrow
at all
that's just me uh
but he didn't tell excuse me
sorry about that he didn't tell the
president or congress
well that's to keep it from leaking it's
the same same issue
and if he had told congress it would
have leaked and i don't think that would
be fair
um
he quit before he could be fired
possibly
thank you all right uh
the child of a candy did blah blah blah
all right
look them up when you have time somebody
says i don't know what you're talking
about
all right i think we've covered
everything haven't we i think we have
that's all for today
i will talk to you tomorrow
and you uh youtubers
all right you got any questions for me
some of you trust bars some of you don't
like them
what's your one sentence explanation for
socialism
sharing versus competition that's
it uh why was my week so bad well you
might find out someday
but today's not the day
uh oh i'm feeling well i mean i'm
healthy i just
you know there are some times when you
have a
you have an unbelievably bad week like
so bad you can't even believe it
it's one of those uh but i'll get over
it
and i will talk to you tomorrow
you
