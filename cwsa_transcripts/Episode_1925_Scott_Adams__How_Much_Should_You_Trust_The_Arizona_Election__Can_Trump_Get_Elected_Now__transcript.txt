to if you'd like to take this experience
up to
really
levels we've never seen before
I'm talking
Quantum tunneling
the secret everything it's all in here
it's science it's it's everything all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker chalices style the canteen
jugular flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
go
oh that was good simultaneity
very good simultaneity
I think your your timing is excellent
today very good
real good all right I was just showing
my locals oops
I was just showing my locals subscribers
before you got on there's a app I was
just playing with called pixel cut it's
one word pixel cut and it produces AI
art
based on your description now you've
seen the ones that are browser-based
but it's now just on an app
and so I was trying to design a book
cover for my upcoming
uh book called reframe your brain so I
wanted a brain
that was sort of floating in space with
maybe some kind of a frame so I wrote
brain in the frame here's the first one
let me regenerate and show you another
take
now it gives you different styles so you
could do a modern wand or a you know
Picasso looking one
it's operating a little slowly but it'll
pop up in a second no I swear it works
okay really is this not going to work
because I'm doing a public demonstration
did the law of public demonstrations
just
just kick in
it did
you know how many times I've tried this
thing
I used it a hundred times yesterday
and I used it 15 times right before I
came alive
it worked every time hahaha
all right well pixel cut I tried to do a
commercial for you but your stupid app
crashed so it all right
um have you noticed
that or by the way the the point of this
if you're wondering which professions
are being replaced by Automation and AI
I can't see a reason that I would hire a
human designer to do my book cover
I don't see the reason
because I can just look at it a thousand
different takes and they're all going to
be cool looking brains floating in
different kind of space with frames one
of them is going to be awesome
I'll just use it
um
anyway have you seen the news about the
various prom queens and homecoming
queens and Beauty contests in which
trans
competitors are winning
there was another one recently I forget
where it was where the trans was it a
homecoming queen or prom queen because
some some of the stories are being
mixed up in my mind
yeah but uh here's my take on it the way
you know I think the way Tucker Carlson
reported it was that people are so woke
that a hugely overweight trans person
wanna want a beauty queen contest in
high school
and I don't think that's what's
happening
do you think it's the wokeness
they got that
that trans person elected
I don't think so
now I think it was that the students
think it's funny
some of them think it's funny
and some of them are genuinely on the
side of the trans person and they they
think that they probably also think it's
funny
because it messes with the adults
if you were in high school are you
telling me you wouldn't vote for the
trans candidate
I would
let me let me see in a vote here imagine
your high school self not your adult
self put yourself back into your high
school mind you told me you wouldn't
have voted for the trans
yeah it's a thing and there's you know
there's also a history of you know gay
and lesbian uh people winning for the
same reason
some people think it's funny just to
mess with the you know the adults and
what they expect and some people are
actually just in favor of the trans
people in favor of the lgbtq and they'd
like to see him win
so I'm not sure anything is happening
here of any importance whatsoever if
you're looking at high school and you're
saying oh there's that trend
we better watch those hypnotized
students nothing like that's happening
those are students who some of them
genuinely like the person and they're
boosting them because it's fun and some
just think the whole thing is funny and
they're just having fun with it that's
all it is
anyway
um I think it's also could be at least
for some of them an example of what I
call malicious compliance
so you tell a bunch of students hey you
must all be woke everybody must be
treated the same
and now I'd like you to vote for the uh
the prom queen
what would you do if you wanted to give
the the teachers exactly what they
wanted
you would vote for the trans candidate
because that's what they're asking for
treat everybody the same all right all
right I'll give you exactly what you
wanted so so some of it's malicious
compliance too that's what makes it
funny
um
anyway there's no real story there I
think that's just anyway I think that's
all positive honestly I think everything
about those stories is positive do you
because because voting for somebody in
high school because they're attractive
is the most up thing in high
school period
let me say it again voting for The
Attractive people to be your king and
queen is the most up thing in
high school period
if the students have decided to
with the most up thing
good job
this is a Applause for the students who
decided to break the most up
thing voting for somebody based on their
appearance
good for them
good for them that's that's that's what
I want to see for my country
well speaking of our country Biden's
overseas
uh calling the cambodians Colombians
[Laughter]
twice
now to be fair
Cambodia and Colombia are words that a
normal person could confuse
like I it would be easy for me to
imagine doing it myself
even maybe twice right there are
definitely things where where I do the
same the wrong name consistently it has
nothing to do with age it's just there's
some things that get in your head so
you know I would say the number of these
things that's been happening has to
concern you if you were looking at it
you know as a single case you'd say that
doesn't really mean much
but as a pattern
as a pattern it's starting to look like
it means something
um but we've lowered our expectation of
Biden so low they can actually go to a
an International Conference to represent
us and call the host country by the
wrong by the wrong country name and
everybody's like
well good enough
ah that was close
yeah he was it started with a C
that's the best we can do right now so
it's fine it's fine
all right here's one of the funniest
stories
um Bill Maher
who I would say he's one of the more
principled
pundits which is different from saying I
agree with him right I like the fact
that he you know he's taken the
financial and other hit to say what
exactly what he believes
and so he's a principled
player and I appreciate that that about
him but he's in a little bit of a pickle
here because he was talking about on
Friday at a show
that the Democrats basically are box
checking group and if you're going to
run for office as a Democrat you'd
better check a box you got to be gay or
brown or a woman or lgbtq of some kind
and so this is Bill Maher saying that a
straight white man is going to have a
hard time getting elected as a Democrat
now what's interesting about that is
that Bill Maher is a straight straight
white man
who who supports a party that wouldn't
let you run for the leadership of the
party because of your gender and your
color
who who supports that
now I get that he has to compare it to
the alternative like I don't want to be
a Democrat and like pretend you know
that the alternative isn't also
influencing what you do of course so I
guess he's I guess he's looked at all
the ins and outs
and decided that the the only team that
specifically discriminates people like
him is his choice to support
can you imagine doing that
can you wrap your head around supporting
the team that says very specifically
people with your color and sexual
preference and gender nope you have very
little chance of being in a leadership
position going forward
how do you support that
I would think that the more principled
stand would be to support neither of
them so he has reasons he doesn't like
the Republican party I get that people
have reasons and he has a really good
reason for not supporting Democrats
because they don't support him
that's the best reason of all
right in an elect in a democratic system
the fact that they're targeting him for
discrimination people like him
that's a perfectly good reason not to
vote for them
but he's got to pick one so I guess he's
picked the one that discriminates
against him directly
doesn't does that just blow your mind
and I guess we we all end up where we
are by you know nobody picks where they
want to go you just sort of end up there
and I think you just sort of ended up
here
yeah it wasn't a choice he maybe would
have made you know 20 years ago but I I
feel like he you know he might be pretty
close to saying okay that's my limit I
don't know we don't know what his limit
is
maybe we'll find out
um
Jen Saki
uh tweeted this she said that what Trump
is doing on Truth social and what Carrie
lake is doing in person and nearly every
stop is sowing doubt in the system and
the process to confuse and alarm people
it's false we need to continue calling
it out
to which I say is it really Trump and
Kerry Lake who are sowing doubt about
the Arizona process because it's mostly
Arizona they're talking about
really if you took if you took Trump and
Kerry Lake out of the process entirely
would the Republicans not notice that
the state doesn't have a result
we wouldn't be talking about it except
for those two people
I feel like the better take is that the
thing that's destroying the credibility
of the election is that it's designed to
do that
so let me let me describe design
the the arizonans as I understand it
designed a system which favored not
standing in line on Election Day that
was a design choice
what they gave up is a quick outcome
so that's that was a choice not a
mistake so every everybody who says
Arizona's like uh functioning wrong
well that's true maybe in terms of the
machines had some trouble and some folks
got mixed up and stuff but that's not
mostly what we're talking about mostly
we're talking about the delay right it's
the delay that seems to be the big thing
well they they built a system
where the delay is not just maybe going
to happen it's guaranteed
they they built a system where counting
the votes well after the the deadline is
part of the system that's intentional
and what they got for that that
trade-off is they got maybe better
participation and maybe shorter lines
now
if you design a system where you make an
intentional trade-off
between The credibility of the system
and let's say the convenience of the
citizens and maybe maybe a participation
as well that's a design choice that's
not a mistake
so if somebody designs a system where
their top priority was not credibility
but rather convenience is the public are
we a bunch of for looking at
their design and saying well they
designed it that way
I didn't do that
is that your fault how many of you are
taking the blame for Arizona's design
the desire is not a mistake
the designer gave them what they wanted
and they traded off exactly what they
knew they would trade
it is designed for lower credibility
by higher convenience
am I wrong if I say my iPhone is a is a
technological Marvel
but it sure is expensive
is that not fair
[Laughter]
the the Arizona
the Arizona design is perfectly designed
for Arizona
that's what they wanted they wanted to
design they gave them exactly what it
gave them there were no surprises no
surprises
now if we respond to their design Choice
exactly the way they knew we would
because there's no surprises
we're we're a little bit skeptical
because of the delay
and that's built into the system
so don't tell me I can't evaluate a
design
that was designed for this outcome now
of course if you ask the arizonans they
would say well we want convenience plus
a totally credible election
but they didn't have that option nobody
knows how to make that
all right
um
I said on Twitter the other day about
Trump that I'm out
and a number of people including Sam
Harris said
that was your final straw
which is actually a pretty good question
yeah why why would that like one comment
about that Trump made about DeSantis or
young can or whatever why would that be
my final straw are any of you wondering
the same thing of all the things Trump
has done or is alleged to do why would
that be my final straw well may I
clarify
I don't know if I'm in the 48-hour
window of clarification I might be
outside the window but allow me to
clarify because I do think I'm guilty of
being unclear
all right so the clarification is this I
was already not supporting Trump
so that's not a change
I was already not supporting him two
reasons nobody that age should be
running for president I've been saying
that for five years right completely
consistently
number two I I've said publicly a number
of times I'm not going to support
anybody going forward who doesn't have a
practical fentanyl plan and I'm not
aware that Trump has anyone like an
actual plan he might end up being the
best one
but at the moment he doesn't have a
specific plan that I'm aware of
so no I did not I did not use that as
the last straw for my supportive Trump I
was already gone right and I'm not
coming back unless
he comes up with a fentanyl plan
if he does
I would consider coming back because I'm
a single single issue voter
now I'm being a single issue of the
owner because it gives me more leverage
so I'm doing it for persuasion reasons
right I get that voters in general have
to make these trade-offs and nothing
single issue I get that just allow me to
do it I'm a public figure
so as a public figure it's a little
different equation than the rest of you
okay so it makes my it makes my
persuasion a little bit more focused if
I just say I just got one issue it's the
most important issue and if you're
ignoring it I'm going to ignore you
now
what did it mean when I sent an amount
if I was already out what I meant by
that which I I expressed poorly
is that I'm not going to wipe the
off of everything that Trump slimes
which I did for about five years
and usually it was a case of explaining
what he really meant
or putting it in context
but when I saw the young Ken thing I
thought you know I'm exhausted
I'm exhausted that that China reference
was totally innocent
right that as we've come to understand
that he was making a point about young
Ken being associated with some you know
Chinese Investments or something and
that's a perfectly good point to make
but it was the wrong time to do it
and he was attacking his own team
and I'm not going to defend that
and I don't feel like defending anything
else he does either because I think he's
he's aged down with the race and he
doesn't have a fentanyl plan now if if I
thought that his election was like an
unambiguous positive I would keep you
know washing the off of stuff that
the uh that the fake news throws at him
right because I'm more interested in you
know getting rid of the fake news about
him but now I'm not sure I care
I'm not sure if I care if the fake news
takes them out
because there's nobody unpacking on
either seat on the other side
so
let me ask you this we're hearing it's
hard to know for sure that uh Jared
Kushner and Ivanka would not be
supportive and would not want to roll in
any future Trump Administration do you
think that's true
this sounds true I mean if I were them I
wouldn't I wouldn't want to do it twice
that's for sure do you think that's true
you don't think that's true interesting
I do I think that's true just because
that's how a normal person would be
nobody would want to do that twice
that'd be crazy
um do you think that Trump could be
successful without Ivanka and Jared
doing some of the heavy lifting
you do
I don't know
I don't know I think it's unknowable
because what what we don't really know
is what that Dynamic was
um one of the things that some people
and I'm one of them suspects is that
Ivanka was way more
positively influential than we'll ever
know
and the reason is that she was on a very
short list
of people who if she disagreed with
Trump
he would stop and listen
like you you would really pay attention
now I think that's a pretty short list
and she was the closest physically to
him and probably had the most time with
him and would have the most influence I
would think
so uh but we don't know right I don't
know if any of that mattered if it was
any topics they disagreed on that made a
difference I don't know
now Don Jr is the next question
do you think uh he would be all in
I feel like he's signaling that he would
be
I don't know do you think Trump could
win without
um I support
I'll just ask the question
most of you say yes you could win
without my support
and I agree I agree he could win without
my support
yeah I don't think he could have won the
first time with them
do you know why does everybody do you
understand that I don't think he would
have won the first time
because the first time he needed to be
defined differently than he was he
needed to be defined as somebody who had
skills not a crazy clown running for
publicity and I think I did that I don't
think I know I did that I I'm the I'm
the one who defined him as skilled
without that he went to one
now it's not the only thing right
everything had to happen the way it
happened to get the result happened and
it wasn't one variable thing but I don't
think it would have worked without that
but now that he served a term
we all know pretty much exactly what
we'd get
and the mainstream even the main even
his enemies
are completely on board with what I
taught them and
2015-16 which is this is actually skill
and even even when I said I'm out
Trump's comments about Junkin that was
skill
if I were in the job of explaining it to
you I would say he created a little
mystery and Intrigue and made everybody
look into it and the looking into it is
exactly what he wanted so he got what he
wanted
and you know he probably doesn't care
that he's taken out some prominent
Republicans to Elbow his way into the
job you know he could always make nice
to them afterwards
Linda who is very dumb says Scott you
don't vote your message about who you
support for president is diminished
nope
nothing works that way
nothing works that way
now people will be influenced by
anything that's influential
so uh the fact that I don't vote should
increase my credibility that's why I do
it
I don't vote to increase my credibility
not to decrease it because the the
reason here is that if you vote
um you've taken aside and you can't you
can't change it
and then you have to defend your side I
don't want to have to defend anybody
I want to be able to say well
I thought they had some skills but turns
out they sucked on this topic
but as soon as I voted for him I'm going
to be
biased toward defending whatever the
hell they do even if it doesn't make
sense that's how people work
all right um
Paul collider was probably watching
right now hi Paul
um tweeted this how can Democrats have
such strong unwavering conviction
talking about the election Integrity
here how can they have such strong
unwavering conviction there's something
that is executed in an unaudible way uh
something two opposing sides spend
billions to win control of uh trillions
probably
um or they spend billions to control
trillions that's his point is also the
lone Paradigm of a man that is absolute
massive flawed okay the point is
how could you look at this situation
and have unwavering conviction
that it was fair
I totally understand if you say there's
no evidence of fraud
so let's treat it like it's fair that
makes sense I'm totally on board with
that
but
how can you just know it's true without
without the benefit of knowledge
and are they just pretending do you
think Democrats are just pretending well
as you know other people noted whoever
is winning is the one who's gonna
um
it was going to accept the election
right
I'd like to give a little shout out a
little bit of respect to the GOP
who's taking quite a beating on their
election performance
and every now and then you have to like
pull back give yourself a little
distance you know if you get too close
to the topic
you you lose sight of the forest but
here's the forest
the GOP
knowingly damaged its odds of power
by pursuing elect um abortion
they knowingly knew it would hurt them
probably in terms of gaining power
and they did it anyway
they did it aggressively they did it
enthusiastically they did it with full
transparency
knowing it would hurt them
there's nothing I respect more than that
honestly
that
is patriotism
that is American
that is why I like conservatives
right conservatives even when I disagree
with them which I often do
they're really good at this you know
keeping their their morals and what they
actually do
somewhat consistent
right
I mean a a conservative if they got
pregnant you know an unwanted pregnancy
probably is going to have the baby
you're more likely than not right
so there is a consistency there that
just has to be respected I think you
know you're you don't have to do
anything that I do of course so I won't
try to persuade you but in my own mind
the the Republicans said in effect
were willing to die on this hill
and then the Republicans then the
Democrats kill them on the hill
so the Democrats got what they wanted
probably you know a little better
election results than they expected and
the Republicans in a weird way got
exactly what they were shooting for
which is they got the moral win and they
were willing to give up a political win
so
I know it is this is as close to the
ideal outcome as you could get given
that nobody can be completely happy on
both sides right you can't make
everybody happy all that this is just
about the closest you could have done
for a perfect outcome
one that you could respect even if you
don't like it
so that's your positive note for today
um
I'm seeing some complaints about
DeSantis and maybe young can iI but uh
DeSantis people are telling me is backed
by billionaire Ken Griffin
uh who's you know I guess founder of
Citadel big financial institution and I
guess he gives immense amounts of money
politically so he's very powerful
um
and but I don't know if why does that
matter exactly can somebody
can somebody connect some dots for me
it doesn't matter because that makes
them a rhino or something is that what's
happening I I see the accusation but I
can't quite understand what the point of
it is because you know that all the
candidates have a billionaire behind
them right
well let me ask you did you know that
did you know that all of the candidates
all of them Trump
Etc they all have at least one
billionaire
or are they really
couldn't win you can't win without at
least one billionaire it turns out you
got to have a one billionaire at least
on your team
does it matter
that Kevin Griffin very publicly
is backing Republicans I think it's
transparent
our system allows that
and all the others have a billionaire
behind them
the the best uh the best description I
ever heard of our political reality
is that it's not it's not like uh the
elites are some group of Illuminati
where where at the very top the
Democrats and the Republicans are
basically all the same people and
they're a little secret society they're
they're running everything from the top
that definitely is not happening
right I can assure you that doesn't
exist I I've been I've spent enough time
behind the curtain to say that doesn't
exist what does exist is more like a
Game of Thrones
you know where there's a billionaire
let's call them the kings in the Game of
Thrones and they're all jockeying to see
who's the head billionaire or the you
know the most important one but it
really is a competitive fight it's just
not a voter fight
the the election is sort of the fake
competition the real competition is
billionaire on billionaire and they're
they're moving assets and they're
they're gaming the system and they're
funding election changes and stuff like
that but the but the election is decided
by the billionaires so whichever
billionaires played a better game
that gets expressed in the election
result and then we all think we decided
but but our opinions were assigned to us
by billionaires
billionaires assigned their opinions you
can see it in real time right now as
Murdoch Murdoch just switched away from
Trump
could not be more obvious
do you think Murdoch switching away from
Trump makes it impossible for Trump to
win
what do you think if Murdoch which means
Wall Street Journal New York Post and
Fox News all go anti-trump can Trump win
no no he can't no Trump cannot win if
Murdoch turns on him he can't so it's
not really about Trump and it's not
about the voters it's just Murdoch he's
the only one
it's his decision to if Trump runs now
could he change his mind absolutely yeah
I mean if it gets down to you know
somehow Trump wins the primary anyway
then Murdoch might have to choose
between Trump and the Democrat and maybe
he'll choose Trump so so Trump could
still change his mind but
I don't know it is a billionaire
competition it's not a voter competition
as soon as you see it as a voter
competition you don't understand the
whole system the system is billionaires
controlled the press the Press assigns
you your opinion you go and vote as if
you had made up your own mind
and then we see which billionaire one
um that's where we are
so somebody made a fake Twitter blue
verified account
on Twitter pretended to be Eli Lilly's
corporate account and tweeted we are
excited to announce insulin is free now
insulin is not free
but apparently it took uh several
billion dollars off of Eli Lilly's uh
stock stock value
Somebody almost crashed the entire stock
market just with a Twitter prank
now I don't think that's the end of the
world
is more funny than it is you know tragic
but we'd better watch out
more of this coming
more coming so the guy who I guess is
mostly in charge of the Border
has been asked to resign and he declined
the guy who's in charge of the Border
his own boss can't get him to to leave
the building
he's so bad at borders that even when
his boss says all right
I'm trying to explain this to you
this building where we work
you're not allowed inside here anymore
you you need to like not be working
so this building this little piece of
real don't don't be in here anymore
you're not allowed within this border
and the guy who's in charge of order oh
yeah yeah I'm just going inside your
border
this is a perfect analogy
anyway so you see the fact that he's
resisting being fired is just hilarious
like the level of incompetence
all right I'd like to uh do a call back
to uh my impression
of Bill Maher
uh
deciding he wants to run for president
and he's talking to the other Democrats
the leadership
and he's he's trying to negotiate how he
could run for president and they say you
know
bill you don't check any of the boxes
we need you to be a woman or gay or
brown or something
and then Bill Maher says all right I
need I need a little more guidance
can you tell me the number of dicks I
have to suck
before I can run for president as a
Democrat would one be enough
could I suck one dick
and then they say
that would be a little bit gay
but I feel like
one would feel like a fluke that would
just feel like you're experimenting
because I don't think one's enough
one just feels like you're having fun
I need
three
I feel like Bill Maher would have to
suck three dicks
because by this by the second one you
would know if you liked it
right
so if you suck three dicks
you've sort of committed yourself like I
think I like this this is working out
for me
so I feel like
Bill Maher is complaining a little too
much because he's saying oh straight
white man can't get elected as a
Democrat but that's not entirely true he
does have a path it's sort of a three
dick situation maximum I think the
fourth one would be unnecessary
in five and six would just be for his
own benefit not really anything
political at all
so anyway that's my advice
uh Bill Maher is just three away
from the presidency
okay
um
so Mexico is running a don't do drugs
campaign you know uh and they've decided
to use as a cautionary tale uh
Philadelphia
[Laughter]
so Mexico is trying to convince young
people to not do drugs by showing live
showing video of what it looks like on
the Streets of Philadelphia
so Mexico is like don't be like
Philadelphia
yes we are a murder hellhole
cartel driven murder hellhole but at
least we're not Philadelphia am I right
am I right yes we have decapitated heads
on the sidewalk yes we do but not much
feces
the level of feces on our streets is
very low decapitated head now and then
hardly ever hardly ever a couple times a
year
you probably won't even see them
so that's that's amazing
uh Dave silver
who would be more Associated we imagine
with the left
although he's never I don't think he's
ever mentioned his political
affiliations but we imagine because of
where he works and stuff he's he's left
leaning but he does a lot of independent
stuff so I'm not sure I know what he is
but
um he's he's saying that the new should
look into it that it appears that
liberal Elise delayed the vaccination
rollout until after the election now you
all think that right it does look like
some Elites Democrats it does look like
Democrats did
put their finger on the scales there and
and delayed that so that Trump wouldn't
look as good
just the fact that Dave silver says it
looks like that obviously happened but
it requires more research to be sure
what really did happen
I think that's pretty open-minded of it
appreciate that uh Aaron Coulter still
hates Trump
somehow that trended today did anybody
think she was going to change her mind
and suddenly become pro-trump I don't
think so
all right
um
so
the GOP has a retiring Senator at
Senator Toomey
and he said that there's a very high
correlation between the Maga candidates
and big losses or at least dramatically
underperforming so he thinks that
President Trump was the problem in the
election
would you agree
do you think that Trump's involvement
caused a bad midterm
I know it kind of depends you know if
Kerry Lake gets elected and and if
Walker gets elected things will look
different right
but at this point it looks like the the
mega
the Maga thing turned out to be a good
attack Vector for the Democrats more
than it was a clever way to get more
Republicans
yeah you think it was mostly abortion
and it wasn't as much Trump
I know but don't you think Trump was the
reason that uh weak candidates weak
candidates were running
wasn't that Trump
yes or no
no you don't think you don't think Trump
was a cause of weak candidates
yep
yeah
I mean he's not the only cause
all right
yeah it's interesting just that a
republican was saying that
can somebody
tell me
um of all of the late
election results
that we've had let's say in the last 10
years
wherever there was a late result and I
don't mean a planned late result that
just happens to be after the election
day I mean where it was unexpectedly
late
how often does the Democrat end up
winning
do we have that
is it every time
or or does the candidate whose party
runs the election in that state win
every time
is there actually a statistic on that
oh Tucker addressed it 10 out of 13. I
don't know if that's right
all right
certainly we have plenty of reason to be
skeptical about the uh the Arizona
situation
wouldn't you agree that the skepticism
is warranted because they designed the
system
for extra skepticism to you know
remember they designed the system for
convenience not to decrease skepticism
they didn't design it to make you less
skeptical
if they did that it would all be done
the delay that's built into the system
there's just no way that you can ignore
that now I don't think there's any you
know any obvious problem and by the way
Arizona's explained away the mixed
ballots the some that were counted some
not counted apparently they have a way
to you know reverse engineer that pretty
easily ah
Junior Coltrane says in all caps Scott
just can't understand
sure Junior Scott just can't understand
in all caps
I'm glad you got your AOL account and
your modem is working
um you might want to look into the whole
all caps thing
just sort of look into that a little bit
all right
um question
which demographic group
uh was most supportive of Democrats you
all know the answer right
it was young it was the young
and younger women in particular but
basically the Young
so Biden got the youth vote
and
um second question totally unrelated
what demographic group does Biden's
policy kill the most of
what group is being killed at at the
highest rate uh you know above their
Baseline
well who dies the most from Fentanyl
youth right so they're killing the most
young people with fentanyl and that is
because a direct result of their
policies
what about school closures
right so we're not talking about just
death we're talking about you know
damage school closures what what group
of people does that damage oh yeah young
people young people
not just young people but young parents
it's young parents as well
how about inflation
well you could say that it affects old
people the most if they're on fixed
incomes
but the old people also have fewer years
of life left
depending on the inflation it could lock
the children end up buying a home
and create a ripple effect that lasts
basically their whole life I feel like
the effect is bigger on the young
is that supportable
inflation hurts the young more because
they can't get started they can't get a
house and then that affects you all the
rest of your life
if you already have a house
if you already have a house the house
goes up with inflation
you already you already have it
you're and probably your property tax
depending on your state even your
property tax doesn't go up
now if they're on a fixed income that
that's going to hurt them as well but
not as many years because they don't
have many left
I don't know how about uh vaccine
vaccination damage
was the vat you know because even no
matter what you think of vaccinations I
think everybody agrees
some number of people had myocarditis is
that mostly the old people of the young
people mostly the young right so that's
that's why uh
at least two companies are now doing a
study to see how much of the effect yeah
younger man
so is it my
is it my imagination
that the Democrats are the worst party
for protecting the Young
but because they promised them uh debt
relief which was totally a lie because
they knew they couldn't do it the young
just said free money
free money yay
now you can kind of understand how the
young would be like this
what what does uh Biden's fentanyl
policy
and his abortion
policy and preference what do they have
in common
and don't say that it kills young people
right one thing that the fentanyl policy
and the um
and the abortion policy have in common
is freedom
young people really like freedom
and if you take their drugs away from
them they might live longer
but they'll have less freedom
am I right
they might want they might want access
they might say yeah people are dying
from overdoses but it was their choice
so I'd rather have the freedom
and I'd rather have the freedom for a
divorce I'd rather have the freedom to
get my drugs I'd rather I'd rather the
people South of the Border are free to
come here
so they do seem to choose danger or
Freedom over Danger
would you say that
young people will choose Freedom over
danger fairly reliably right well what's
the most common thing a teenager says
yeah I know it's dangerous I want to do
it anyway
right this is the most common thing they
say I hear you I hear you it's a bad
idea I'm going to do it anyway because
it was really fun and I don't care about
the risk
right
so it's uh just an oddity
but you can understand it why Biden is
killing the most people in the
demographic group that supports him the
most
interestingly
but at least they get imaginary College
relief college that relief out of it so
it's not like they came up on an
empty-handed huh
yeah Freedom's just another word for
Nothing Left to Lose I suppose
um let me do a little test of your
knowledge
you are aware
um Michael schellenberger has done a
great job about this the San Francisco's
um open-air legal drug experiment seems
to be a huge failure right do you all
know that
so San Francisco said well we'll give
all these
druggies on the streets some free drugs
and at least it'll be safer because
they're at least the drug taking part
will be less lethal
and then it just became a you know a
Walking Dead encampment and ruined the
city and everything all right now that
now that you know that didn't work
when I say
the best treatment for fentanyl would be
to legalize
safer alternatives
does that sound like something that's
already tried and failed
I say legalize
safe alternatives
does it sound like it's been tried and
failed
yes right
and San Francisco seems like the one who
tried it and failed right
do you not see the gigantic difference
between what I'm saying in what San
Francisco did see the trouble is the
trouble is that they they feel too much
alike
but the difference is gigantic
here's the difference
I wouldn't give drugs to Street people
I should have said that I guess the San
Francisco gave drugs to the people on
the streets which gives you more Street
people so I ruined San Francisco
that couldn't possibly be a good idea
I would I wouldn't let Street people
have free drugs
I would let somebody who works in the
cubicle have free drugs
yeah if you have the place you live and
you have a job
I'll give you safer Alternatives and you
work it out you know you figure out how
to how to get that monkey off your back
or or you live mildly addicted and you
just are a functional addict and maybe
that's your choice
the people on the streets
I would say you could have free drugs
but you have to get off the street
minimum requirement you know you have to
get into some treatment or off the
street or something but I wouldn't give
them free drugs on the street
you're trying to get them off the street
so do you understand my frustration when
I say the fentanyl thing has something
we could test
to see if it makes a difference right my
stepson
my stepson of course is anecdotally you
can't can't make policy based on one
person I get that but my stepson wasn't
homeless
he wasn't homeless
he was just somebody who liked drugs too
much
and he knew the fentanyl was the risk
that could kill him
if he knew that he could take a drug
that definitely didn't have fentanyl he
would have done it
he didn't have the option
but there are more people like my
stepson dying from overdose than three
people
do we have an epidemic of the homeless
dying of drug overdoses
I've never heard that anybody even
mention it
have you
I mean maybe they don't maybe they don't
die if maybe it's like
maybe it's like covet you know they
didn't seem to die of covid
and nobody really understood why I don't
think maybe they just are better at
drugs
because one of the things that would
keep you alive if you do Fentanyl is
knowing you're taking it
so if you're a street person you might
say give me some Fentanyl
you know what you have and then you just
deal with that risk knowingly and that's
safer than dealing with it unknowingly
yeah maybe they have superpowers but
I don't know how to beat this problem
see the problem is the that the the
thing that failed miserably the open-air
drug thing in San Francisco that was
unambiguously a failure but they did
everything wrong
and because they did everything wrong
I'll never be able to persuade anybody
to try something that doesn't involve
the homeless
right
but you see the problem right the
problem is those two things are too
similar in people's minds so now you
can't do the good thing because the the
bad thing didn't work
now I don't know let me be clear I don't
know the giving people safe Alternatives
would work
it's just the obvious thing to try
is the obvious thing if you're not
trying the most obvious thing
well how serious are you really
how serious are you
you sell it to buy one and get the
second dose for free
Maybe
um
try something besides prison yeah
are you talking about suboxone methadone
no I'm talking about uh giving somebody
uh oxy
uh codeine instead of fentanyl
but giving them an amount they know
exactly what they're getting
because as bad as that is you know oxy
or heroin or something as bad as those
are and they're really bad they're not
nearly as bad as Fentanyl
right
so you could you could first get them
off the thing that kills them and then
they're going to live longer and maybe
they have a chance of you know getting
off the other drugs
but but you know first you put the
tourniquet on and keep them from dying
so they have a chance
all right
addiction doctors should chime in on
this I agree
why would a parent want their kids to do
drugs in the first place who said that
who thinks that somebody wants their
kids to do drugs
like that's what you heard
you listened to this and you thought
there are some parents who want their
kids to do drugs no nope nothing like
that
uh Darwin effect is a good thing for the
species thank you Shepard for mentioning
in public that the death of my stepson
is good for the public
yeah you're you're a fine fine human
being there
I'll bet your parents are proud of you
um although maybe you're not wrong
saying saying in public to me is sort of
a dick move but I don't actually
disagree with your point
it's uh unfortunately it does exactly
what you said
and it and it did it in my case as well
yeah if I can be blunt
my stepson wasn't going to add to
society
let me say that as clearly as possible
he wasn't going to add
right you probably would have killed
somebody accidentally like he wasn't
violent but
he usually could have been the guy who
gave somebody the fentanyl that killed
him right I once saw him drive
when he didn't know that I saw that I
was on the street
he he should never have been able to use
a motor vehicle
but nobody was going to stop him once he
was an adult so he was an adult who
should never have been in a motor
vehicle
but nobody could stop him once he's an
adult
so is the world better off that he's
gone yes yes it's a hard thing to say I
mean I I loved him deeply
and I still see him everywhere
and it hurt me like nothing probably
will ever hurt me again
but
is the world better off yes yes he was
he was damaging to the world in many
ways and he and he had no interest in
ever working
he had no interest in adding anything to
the world and it would tell you you'd
tell you directly you didn't want to
practice anything because he didn't want
to get good at anything
that was an actual philosophy I'm an
adult
an adult I mean a young adult
but as an adult
he said he would he would not agree to
practice anything and get good at it
because he doesn't like practicing
anything
and so his he wanted to go through life
without ever trying to be good at
anything including working anything
that was his actual
preference he also said many times that
he knew he was in a risky lifestyle and
he preferred to die
over being limited and having his
freedom taken away
he got what he wanted
he literally chose death over a lack of
freedom
he he chose it often and clearly like he
said it as clearly as you could say as
many times as you want to hear it he
chose the risk a high risk of death
over having his freedom impinged in any
way
this is not a choice you and I would
have made but he made a choice that got
him exactly what you would expect him to
get and he knew he knew that was the
risk and there was now here's the other
factor I also don't think he had a
chance of being happy
again that that's a hard truth I don't
believe he had a chance of being happy
in life because he had beliefs and
philosophies that guaranteed he would be
miserable and
so he did have a death wish
right I will give her the details but
let's just say I know for sure he had a
death wish
so he wasn't afraid of the risk and he
didn't mind dying
and he would rather have a short fun
life
then a long one with people telling them
what to do where he couldn't do drugs
and he got
he got his choice
so on one it it's funny it's
uh as much as it hurt me
and I wouldn't have chosen that outcome
um
he did get what he asked for
so it's not a tragedy like other
tragedies it's different
because it's such a special case but
um that's the real world the real world
is complicated
the real world is not you know so simple
that this was bad and this was good this
was a complicated situation
now
part of the reason that I fight Fentanyl
is because I would like his life to have
meaning
you all get that right
you all get that
you know that gives meaning to his life
and it gives meaning to mine as well if
I have any success at all but also uh
China did this
and the cartels did this
and
all other considerations aside
if you kill my kid
it's to the death
you all understand that too right my
fight with China and the cartels is to
the death
right you you you should obviously see
that I'm risking my life to go after the
cartels in China
you know that right I'm literally
risking my life
 every one of them
if you kill my kid it's still the death
you're all with me right
you're all the same page right if it
were your kid it's to the death
there's no Nuance anymore
right I'm going to destroy China or the
cartels or they'll kill me first
but I'm not going to quit
I'm going to take their heads
and if I can
now the odds of the cartel killing me
are pretty good unfortunately
I mean you just have to want to
but uh if they do
then I'm going to get what I want as
well
because if they kill me
They're All Dead
because you don't kill a prominent
American and and just walk away from it
like I I have enough let's say
prominence is the wrong word that sounds
like a compliment to myself I have
enough visibility
I have enough visibility that if the
cartel took me out
the odds of them getting flattened would
be really higher right because would you
let that happen
forget about me if they took out some
prominent political you know voice in
America on either side doesn't matter
who it is do you think we'd let that go
I don't think so
I think that would be War
m not not me specifically but just
anybody
uh
protect the Tesla Factory
I don't care about the Tesla Factory in
China
if Tesla loses their Factory in China
that would be very expensive for me
because I I own some Tesla stock
uh
but I would still
I'd be okay with that whatever it takes
do not underestimate the ability of
Americans to not care yeah well that's
the fight isn't it the not caring part
um
China is unsafe for business
Eric says you slept with Carrie Lake
I'll bet you didn't
Junior says I'll bet if Scott stops
smoking weed he would think of the world
differently
probably
yeah yeah if I stopped uh smoking weed I
would lose all of my positivity
um and I would hate the world and
wouldn't probably wouldn't bother trying
to help
so I think you're true
I believe
all right
um
why would China help the U.S they
wouldn't
what
how do I know what
oh in 2002
well Eric is making his claim that he
had an affair with Carrie Lake
should we care about that
does anybody care about Gary Lake's sex
life
I don't
I don't
it doesn't seem weird to you when we're
still calling out uh gay politicians for
being elected
you know we're still like first lesbian
governor
that wouldn't you be insulted if you
were the first lesbian governor in 2022
all right there was a time when calling
it out made sense but in 2022 here's
what it sounds like
congratulations your life is very
successful uh you're now the governor of
a major State and you like to
munch on drugs
and then you'd be the governor you're
like
wait a minute those two things how does
that fit together
well you're the governor of an important
state and you like to put your tongue on
vaginas
hold on hold on
that's a true statement but can we
separate these things
can we separate these
like maybe we could talk about my job
today
how about my job
oh yeah your job is good too
but we would like to equally note your
uh enthusiasm for talking vaginas no no
no that is a different topic can we can
we
not talk about that
let's get over it
Kansas has a lesbian kickboxer Native
American
I'd vote for that
you had me at lesbian kickboxer Native
American
like I'd vote for her just automatically
I like all of that I like all of that
oh by the way uh Jake Paul and uh Andrew
taint are gonna have a fight Is that
real
has that been scheduled
there's no there's no there's no fight
I've ever wanted to see more than that
now I don't know who's going to win
uh I think I would typically go for the
younger person with higher weight
which would be Jake Paul I don't know
anything about fighting so maybe you
know maybe Andrew taint is just a better
fighter so maybe he'll win
but uh
wouldn't you favor the heavier younger
person
about a 10-year difference I think
you think Tate will beat him maybe
Maybe
yeah because one's a boxer and one's a
cage fighter and maybe it's different
skills
uh
all right well I'll watch it
yeah the thing about Andrew daint that
uh is vexing but
um interesting
is his entertainment factor is very high
uh I just don't like them personally
because we have some personal
interactions that were negative but it's
hard to look away
I mean he puts on the show
tonight it's not tonight is it
wait is it tonight
he's
is it no it's not tonight because we
would have got much more
uh warning I think yeah not tonight okay
all right I think I got everything uh
I think I covered everything is there
any topic I missed
anything I missed
I think it's
probably the best show ever and remember
when you're standing in line
and you're bored
what do you do
what do you do when you're standing in
line and you're bored
that's when you breathe
take your two inhales the Andrew uberman
method
and the long and exhale
and by the way the the two sniff inhales
you know through your nose
and followed by the exhale I feel
immediately different
do you have the same thing because when
I do the exhale I just let everything
out
you know just
I feel immediately different
yeah
I checked my uh blood pressure yesterday
without meds
it was 118 over 78.
that's with just lifestyle
and it was like a few weeks ago it was
like with meds when I was on meds it was
like you know 140 Plus
and just stopped everything and just
take a walk
cut down in my caffeine
that's about it and 118 over 78. like
perfect
all right I didn't talk about the FTX
crash yeah the cryptocurrency exchange
the owner was worth billions and he was
a major Democrat donor
it turns out the whole thing was
apparently not stable the whole thing
just disappeared now
Bitcoin took a too right all the
cryptos were in the toilet
but the stock market's looking good
yeah
who who could have ever imagined there
would be a major cryptocurrency Scandal
of that type who could have ever seen
that coming
besides everyone everyone
all right is crypto done I don't think
crypto can be done
uh and I had been advising I heard
somebody saying this was bad advice
but before this happened I had been
saying you know you might want a little
bit of
Bitcoin just as a hedge in case the rest
of the money becomes worthless
um I wouldn't be buying the weird
kryptos
you know I'm not sure his ether is
ethereum I'm sorry is ethereum still
good
is that still is that still as
you know safe none of them are safe but
is this still in the Bitcoin realm or as
ethereum
as ethereum lost its luster
that's where most of my money is but I
don't I don't look at it so my
my investment approach with crypto
is that I accidentally ended up with
some I had some small amount that turned
into a large amount while I wasn't
watching
and I'm just never going to look at it
it's just going to do whatever it does
all right so I do have a little bit of
Bitcoin a little bit ethereum I don't
know if it's a good idea I I'm not sure
if it still makes sense to assume that
some small amount of your portfolio
should have that as a hedge
maybe it was bad advice I know generally
speaking diversification is always good
but crypto is a weird thing to diversify
into because it's it's it's a risk like
nothing else
you can move uh eth with zero fees now
really
uh why did I not talk about Elon Musk
there's nothing new today right
did anything happen with Twitter today
we may have talked about the fake
Twitter account
but I don't think there's any new Elon
Musk anything is there
um
the Doge of Venice all right
uh Ukraine I think is going to settle
into a winter
Siege not a Siege but I think it's just
gonna be a winter stalemate
all right
Blake Masters lost that was that
official
is it official the blank Masters loss I
know somebody called the election
but it's not official is it
he's still statistically possible
even fox called it yeah
well they do have that issue of some of
the ballots being mixed up but it looks
like they can solve that
it's been called by a few different
Outlets
yeah
and then is Carrie Lake going to lose as
the extra votes come in
did we go from Kerry lake is definitely
going to win because the extra votes
will favor Republicans do we go all the
way from that to she's going to lose
uh did the popcorn thing ever take off I
doubt it
so Kelly's officially the winner
yeah
well
they're bringing in new boxes yeah
um
has Russia had most of his victories in
the winter throughout history
um
I think Russians Russia's winter
victories when were is when Russia was
being attacked in the winter
so that's not the case
and bober is looking like she might win
now
like everything we thought has sort of
turned around backwards from what we
thought was all definitely going to
happen
all right she'll eat it out maybe
all right that's all I got for today
uh
more more people yelling at me in all
caps
now is is is criticizing somebody in all
caps is that the ultimate cell phone
no here's the L of the ultimate
the ultimate cell phone is when people
say Scott you're no genius
and they spell genius g-e-n-u-s or or J
yeah genius with a J that's the ultimate
cell phone
you're no genus
but I think yelling is somebody in all
caps
might be the ultimate cell phone because
you're shouting uh I'm a idiot
but also listen to what I have to say
so as soon as I see the Caps I don't I
don't I discount everything don't you
when you see caps don't you discount all
of it
I do
what if it's post-post irony all right
now that now everybody's writing in caps
at me hahaha uh
your sister lives in Livermore and says
hi
well tell her I said hi too hi to your
sis
all right
um
all right love the show it's the best
show in politics so pretty sure this is
the best show uh on politics period
and I'm gonna take off now
your comments are funny and I'll see you
soon
