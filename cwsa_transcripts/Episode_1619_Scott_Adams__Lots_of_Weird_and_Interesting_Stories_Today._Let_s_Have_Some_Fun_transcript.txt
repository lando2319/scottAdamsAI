it'll be awesome
and you made it to the best thing that
ever happened it's called coffee with
scott adams and boy do i have a show for
you today because the news is serving
out serving up some
goodness some entertainment and some
good news too
and all you need to enjoy this to the
maximum extent which is that's the kind
of person you are
would you settle for less
no
no you wouldn't you want it all and if
you want it all all you need is a copper
margaret glass a tanker chelsea stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day
it's called the simultaneous step and
it's going to happen now go
yeah that was good
well in the most important news of the
day
an israeli team of scientists
trained a goldfish to drive
now the way they did that was they built
little wheels
that would go on the bottom of the
goldfish's
fishbowl
and they had various lidar and
detection technology
so that they could look at the fish
and they could determine which way the
fish was heading
and then they would just make the the
fish's little car
there was a fishbowl with wheels
driving the directions the fish seemed
to be heading
and they could actually t this is real
by the way
i'm being asked on locals is this real
yes
i mean it's really in the news
i mean i don't know if that makes it
real
so
it's a little fish tank
somebody says has anyone told gutfeld
i'm not sure what that comment means but
it's funny
are you saying that he should have a
little tank so he could drive around
or
i'm not sure what that combat means
anyway
i for one would like
this product because i always like it
when my dog wants to play
and she'll come find me somewhere in my
office you know the dog will come in
like
you know the dog wants some attention
but if my fish wants some attention
how am i even gonna know but if my fish
could sort of drive his little tank into
my office and just sort of look at me
with his big fish eyes
i think they do that don't they
i would know oh my fish wants to play
my fish wants to play oh got phil bought
a goldfish is that the story
oh he has a pet fish on the five
okay
i didn't know if you thought that
gupfeld should have one of those little
cars
or if he had a fish i wasn't sure which
way you were going with that
speaking of gothfeld there's a
washington post major feature story on
them
you want to hear something funny
so if you watch uh either the five or uh
goth held on fox you know that greg
gotfeld often makes fun
of brian stelter on cnn
and often makes fun of his let's say his
his fitness
shall we say
and although i don't like to do body
shaming it is in the news so i'm going
to talk about it
uh
so i was reading the washington post
piece and it's very complimentary i have
to say so so imagine if you will
gotfeld who is associated with fox news
and they do a major feature piece on
them in the washington post which would
be associated with sort of the other
team
and still
the nature of the story was he's a huge
success and he's just killing in the
ratings and
and uh
and all that
now
here's the funniest part
the person writing the story
called brian stelter for a comment
brian stelter got a comment from the
washington post or a call from the
washington post
or maybe a message i don't know
asking him to comment on the story in
which his greatest critic
is a huge success with two shows one of
the biggest powers in all of
news and opinion and influence in the
country
that's scaffeld
and
stelter was asked
what did stelter think about the fact
that guffield thinks he's fat
i'm paraphrasing they didn't ask the
question that way but that was the
nature of it
how would you like to be
how would you like to be the one on the
struggling
the struggling network
that that they asked for a comment
about the huge success of your your
greatest critic
and could you comment about the fact
that he makes fun of you for being fat
uh
so
stealther did not have a comment
which i think was the right way to play
that
all right
yesterday i tweeted for some help to
help me buy pants
i'm down to one pair of pants
you know how if you buy some pants you
know some will not stop fitting and
some will get some stain you can't get
out of it for some reason
next thing you know you're down to one
pair of pants well i've been down to one
pair of pants for about
oh
four or five months
[Laughter]
so i either wear sweatpants pajamas
or my one pair of pants
and
the reason that i don't buy another pair
of pants
is not because i can't afford it but
because i hate shopping and i also don't
know what to buy
so i'm at that age where i have the most
impossible shopping
problem
if i see some pants that i say well
those look like good pants
they're not really going to be made for
somebody my age
and demographic right so the things that
look great that would be inappropriate
on me
and then there are things that
would look appropriate on me
that don't look great
so i was wondering if anybody has
figured out how to solve the problem
of something that would look good
on somebody in my demographic because i
don't think anybody ever has so a lot of
people had some comments and most of
them were
let's say less than useful
it turns out that
people have very different opinions on
pants
but
i did get some good ideas however here's
my bigger point
don't you think that shopping is
backwards
because right now if i want to buy a
pair of pants
i go forth into the world and i have to
search for them
why am i doing all the work
shouldn't the one who wants to sell me
the pants be doing the work
like why am i a hunter-gatherer for
pants
i mean the
figuring out what to buy and then where
to buy it and finding the right size
trying it on
might have to you know get some
tailoring on the legs it's a giant giant
pain in the ass that's why i put it off
so long
so
what i did was just tweet it and then
the information came to me
that's how shopping should be
when you shop you should not have to go
to a store or google anything there
should be a site i tried to by the way i
tried to
create a startup that would do this
years ago didn't go anyplace but
the idea should be everybody who wants
to buy something if you're in the market
you should post what you're in the
market for
i'm in the market for a car
something in this range
um
oh sorry carpe
oh god carpe dunked him saying his uh 18
year old nephew died of fentanyl
overdose on new year's eve
that hits close to home
all right um
but
what was i talking about pants yes not
just pants but consumers should be able
to post what they want to buy
and then have anybody who
is in that market provide them exactly
the right solution
so uh that's how shopping should work
anyway uh it takes a village to put
pants on me apparently
uh
erasmus in the asses poll said should
social media and they mentioned twitter
and facebook
should they regulate content
what do you think republicans said and
what do you think democrats said about
twitter and facebook who are
leaning democrat
do you think that democrats think that
democrats should be able to regulate
content
it turns out they do
very surprisingly
democrats believe that democrats should
be in charge of
content um so only 32 percent
of dems were opposed to twitter and
facebook regulating content
on the gop side 72 percent were against
it are you surprised
that the people who are not on the same
team as the regulators of content
don't like it so i think all we found
down is that there's such a thing as
republicans and democrats
and they just line up by their team
as you would expect now let me ask you
this
if the social networks
were right-leaning let's say all the big
ones were right-leaning
would they
regulate content
in the other direction
such that democrats would say no i don't
want content regulated
because the conservatives are regulating
my good content
i think the answer is yes
i think this would yeah if you say no i
i feel
i feel you're being a little too
generous there
do you think that conservative networks
would let people uh post pictures of
let's say
uh aborted babies
i don't know i'm just trying to think of
some example i i've got a feeling
that whoever is in control thinks that
what is reasonable
is what agrees with them
am i wrong don't most people say all
right we all like free speech
facebook says that twitter says that
everybody says that
there's nobody on the other side of free
speech
it's just
where is the line
that goes too far in a commercial sense
now in a government sense is a different
standard but if you're running a
business
you probably need to draw the line
because even the right leaning
alternates alternatives to twitter
even they have a line
you can't do outright nazi racist
propaganda on any network
so i'm pretty sure that the problem is
who's running it it's not so much the
question of whether content should be
regulated i think that's a phantom
bob saget passed away unexpectedly
at unfortunately just about exactly my
age
do you see what i did there
do you see how i made uh bob saget's
passing about me
have you looked at twitter
i can't believe how many people made bob
saget's death about them
like i just did some somehow we can we
can turn everybody's tragedy into
something about us
but the thing that was amazing is how
many celebrities
usually in the comedy world said they
had just talked to him
how many people does this guy talk to or
did he
that there were so many people say i
just talked to him last week or i just
talked to him yesterday he talked to a
lot of people but the most amazing thing
about this
was that almost a hundred percent of the
people said the same thing
that he was the nicest guy
ever
i mean exaggerated a little bit but did
you notice that almost every person said
nice
and generous
wow
talk about sticking landing
i've often said that the
my strategy for my life
is to live for the best funeral
meaning the most people who care if you
die
one way to to measure whether you lived
a good life
is how many people care when you die
and so i've always thought that that
would be my standard to have the maximum
number of people
willingly go to my funeral as opposed to
just have to because they're related or
something
do you ever see the movie
the big fish
i'm not going to tell you what that's
about
except it's related to this conversation
great movie i really love that movie one
of my all-time favorites it's called the
big fish
don't bail out of it till the end
that's my only advice if you're gonna if
you try to watch it
do not bail out before the end
that's
just don't even bother if you think
you're not gonna watch the whole thing
that's all i'm gonna say
um
anyway
uh i don't think you can do better
as a human being
than bob saget
and i i say that without much knowledge
of his life whatsoever i'm looking
entirely at the reaction of the people
i've never seen
you know
actually i think i've never seen this
reaction have you
have you ever seen as good a reaction
well good it's the wrong word
but as uh
i've never seen this this is unusual
but the other thing that i noticed was
hard to not notice is that in photos did
you notice his recent photos
his recent photos look like he was
very ill
yeah
and norm mcdonald had the same kind of
the same situation
um
but also norm mcdonald looked ill
looked pretty ill before he died as well
so if you look at both of them and you
see with the the recent pictures on the
year that they died
somebody should have known something was
going on because there was definitely
something going on health-wise
don't know what it is
um let's talk about those sudden athlete
deaths you know the athletes that are
dropping like flies
i am a skeptic
that those are really telling us
something as you know now you've seen
the videos of like athletes just
dropping like flies it seems like and
people think it's because of the
vaccinations
that's the allegation
but um i'm a skeptic because i think
that we would see people dying in all
kinds of
different industries as well
and it would just be so obvious
especially within the sports leagues
that the other players
wouldn't be able to talk about anything
else
right if this were true
it's all we would be talking about
it's all we would be talking about
so i saw
a fascinating
thread on twitter
in which
a user named
rainbel jangler
decided to challenge some of the claims
and looked at a list of a long list of
actual names and people who
had recently dropped dead of a heart
attack in professional sports or
high-end sports
and
this critic uh
noted that very many people on that list
had not been vaccinated
so it was the list of people who had
been vaccinated
and then died suddenly
except the list of people had been
vaccinated and died suddenly
included a lot of people who would not
have been even eligible for the
vaccination at the time of their death
in other words somebody who was 16 who
couldn't have gotten a vaccination when
he died
somebody was 64 and retired couldn't
have been vaccinated
ebola
so so it's easy to demonstrate that a
lot of the people that are claimed to be
after vaccination we're actually not
vaccinated at all
um
so yeah so the question is whether the
whether that kind of
information could be controlled
as the commenter just said
do you think that professional sports or
big pharma or anybody
could control
professional athletes dropping dead at
unprecedented rates all over the world
in every sport
remember it's every sport
all over the world with different
organizations controlling
could they control all of that
maybe
maybe temporarily
i'm going to say no though
i i think the smarter bet is no
so here's what i would ask you to do
i i tweeted it so you can find it in my
thread from this morning
look at the claims for all the deaths
and then look at just one critic
tearing those claims to shreds
that's all that's the only thing i'll
add is that just just look at the critic
and look at the claims
and and you could at least see that some
are not true
that doesn't mean there's nothing there
right
somebody says nfl and nba players are
not dropping dead that's correct
yeah wouldn't you wouldn't you know if
an nba player dropped dead
name one
name an nba player who dropped dead
from vaccinations
right
uh all right
there is an effort going on to try to
create a vaccine for addicts
um they don't they don't have it yet but
apparently since the 50s this idea has
been kicking around
it sounds like it might be achievable
but they're they're nowhere near it yet
it's just an effort to see if they can
do it so what they plan to do is just
try to do some kind of a major trial
once a year
this is a
university of minnesota
no wait no it's uh
uh recently universally the
university of washington is doing
so this might be 10 years off before we
see anything but
imagine that imagine a vaccination for
addiction
maybe
maybe i mean it would be one more thing
to worry about right
somebody says addiction is a mental
illness
no
now
addiction is not a mental illness
that that is really not close
to reality
uh addiction is some people have the
capacity to have a different response to
some drugs and then once the drugs are
in you you you become the drug
so it doesn't matter who you are at that
point
uh yeah i would say it's it's more of a
it's more of a disease that some people
have a susceptibility to more than
others
now what do you ever have this this
thought
when you see all the problems that other
people have do you ever say to yourself
i got a lot of problems myself but thank
goodness i don't have that one
i'll tell you the one that i feel
thankful for
all the time
is that i don't like alcohol that much
i mean i've enjoyed having drinks with
friends a billion times i don't drink
now because i think alcohol is poison
but
anyway
new studies on exercise and dementia
did you know
the studies in the past have shown that
exercise can reduce your risk of
dementia by 30 to 80 percent
30 to 80 percent
from exercise
is there anybody not exercising
i'd like to do a little shaming right
now for your benefit i'd only do it for
your good
how many of you don't exercise
i just don't
in the comments
just admit it do you not exercise at all
not even taking a walk
some say not enough
i do not not enough not enough hardly at
all not enough now i know my
my group is uh skews a little bit older
wow
now if you're injured that's a different
thing of course
wow
all right let me give you some advice
now this advice comes from my book
but also comes from
uh if you look at atomic habits or the
book habits so so i'm going to give you
some advice for fixing that exercise
thing
uh that will work for all of you
it goes like this start with the
smallest thing you can do
which is i don't feel like exercising
but you can walk around the block
right so just do that
let's say you don't you can't even walk
around the block you're you're just
being
i i talk about this trick in my book
had i failed almost everything put on
your exercise footwear
and your exercise maybe sweatpants or
something just put them on but give your
permission give yourself permission to
not work out
you're going to find yourself feeling oh
you know i got my
got my footwear on and i've got my
exercise clothes on at least i'll clean
the house
you know while i'm dressed like this
you'll find that you can trick yourself
into exercising
by
wearing the clothes
and starting small
so let's say you say to yourself you
know i can't do much exercise but i can
walk around the block every day that's
it that's all i can do i can't do one
more thing than that
then walk around the block every day
two weeks later you're gonna say to
yourself you know i think i can walk
around this block a second time
don't worry about it
even if you think you can walk around
the block a second time
don't do it unless you really want to
so my advice on exercise is never ever
do something you don't want to because
that will train you to dislike it
only only do things you like
and then build from that so here's one
thing i like i like putting on my
exercise clothes and taking a walk
real easy
the sun feels good i clear my head i
listen to some music
i usually do it about the same time of
day
it's a habit
so here are the things start super super
small
but be well let me back up
i've told you the difference between
wanting and deciding right
don't bother even trying to exercise if
you just want to
just don't even bother it's not going to
work
the only way you should decide to
exercise
is by deciding to exercise
it's got to be a decision
then you can do it
don't don't say you know people exercise
i'd like to exercise i wish you were
easy i'll do some more exercise that's
nothing that's nothing
exercise has to be a base
a base need
and you have to decide it's who you are
so it's not just deciding to do it
don't just decide to do it decide is who
you are now
that's who you are
you are now a person who one way or
another is going to find a way to be
active today and that's your goal your
goal is to be active every day if you
get that right
active could be cleaning the garage
could be taking a walk could be playing
a sport could be lifting some weights
doesn't matter just be active every day
and you'll get addicted to it give
yourself a treat
nice protein shake something healthy
make sure you get lots of protein by the
way big mistake people make is they'll
exercise and eat salad
if you're going to exercise and eat
salad don't bother
just don't do either one because it's
not going to help you a bit i mean a
little bit but you're not gonna be able
to stick with it
if you exercise eat protein
and say to yourself
exercise and protein exercise and
protein do not say to yourself
exercise and food do not say to yourself
exercise and salad
say exercise protein exercise protein
nothing else
what do you eat before you exercise
protein what do you after you exercise
protein
should you also have carbs yes yes but
you're going to get them anyway
you know hopefully they're the good
carbs not the bad carbs but you're never
going to have a problem getting carbs
carbs are everywhere
getting the right kind of protein is
hard
so when you exercise say exercise
where's my protein exercise where's my
protein now the way i do it was with a
protein bar
or a protein shake because they're easy
if you make it hard to get protein like
you you need a steak it's not going to
happen
so you got to get
protein and exercise together start
really really small
decide to do it
reward yourself when you do
and also give your permission yourself
permission not to do it
after you put your exercise clothes on
definitely put your exercise clothes on
but then say you know it just wasn't
there today
several times a year back when my gym
was open and i didn't need a mask and i
went there i would put on all my
exercise clothes drive
10 miles to
5 miles to the gym
walk into the gym
look at the lobby of the gym and i would
say
nope
nope
i just don't have it today and i would
literally just walk
turn around poop
walk directly out the door get in my car
and drive home and call it a success
do you know why it's a success
because i did it every day
getting to the gym is a success if if
the way you had scored that
was you didn't exercise that day no no
that's that's wrong
the way you score it is you got to the
gym
if you keep that as your score
it's impossible to fail practically
because just the doing it it's the
system the routine the habit that's
that's the only thing you want to nail
it
let the exercise happen naturally
let the variety the learning how to
exercise correctly you'll learn all that
just by doing stuff and getting bored
and exercising and trying different
things all right
so um
i have to say it really bothered me to
see how many of you don't exercise
because exercise really is just taking a
walk at it at a certain age right it's
just taking a walk
and i've been
doing a little experiment on myself
to see how my mental state is on days
when i take a long walk
and on days when i don't
have you ever done that experiment
test your mental state
on a day you took a long walk
it could be some other kind of exercise
but i got outdoors i i had the outdoors
part so don't you know the gym is great
but being outdoors and taking a walk
just changes your whole mental state and
dramatically i would say it's dramatic
it you can't not
you can't not notice it it's pretty big
all right
um farming the ocean there's an indian
startup that's basically making a
tractor for the ocean
that that's my own description so
basically it would be a c combine a
combine meaning one of those big
machines that you use for farming on
land
and it would automate a catamaran that
simultaneously harvests and replants
seaweed apparently there's all kinds of
stuff you can do with seaweed it's a
good protein source you can turn it into
lots of different you know food
food ingredients etc i think it has some
commercial uses and so if we had this
device the sea combine you could just
farm the ocean
yeah every time you as soon as you worry
about like running out of food
somebody invents a c combine and there
you go
i also think this might solve the
correct me if i'm wrong but don't we
have a big fertilizer shortage
i think we have a giant fertilizer
shortage for land that wouldn't apply if
you farm the ocean
i'm assuming
all right so that's good news that's
coming
um do you know peter schiff famous
economist he had a tweet on bitcoin that
caught my attention
so one of the most famous economists
whose names
the people who follow this stuff have
heard of
he tweets this he says the real problem
with bitcoin
isn't volatility
volatility means bit bitcoin can't
function as a currency
but it makes it very appealing to
traders and speculators
the real problem is that bitcoin has no
underlying value to support his price
making a terminal collapse inevitable so
he says that bitcoin is inevitably going
to collapse because there's nothing that
supports it
no no physical asset or anything
and here was my tweet response
isn't the entire economy supported on a
platform of psychology
do you think that bitcoin is the one
part of our economy that depends
entirely on psychology to exist
i feel like that's the whole economy
the economy is nothing but a psychology
invention
it's the psychology of knowing that if
you pay for something
you'll probably get it
the psychology of knowing that if you
don't get it you have a recourse the
courts or
you know other recourse
the the capitalism itself is nothing but
a psychology device
why would you pick bitcoin out of all
that psychology and say this is the one
that doesn't have backing
none of it has backing does it
does it
now the argument for the us dollar
having a real value
is that you can always pay your taxes in
it
so you always have that
you can always pay your taxes
but all it would take is one one big
country that would accept bitcoin to pay
the taxes and i think that creates a
market doesn't it
so
more boring than covet
goodbye
i will solve you of your pain
you are hidden
oh he sells gold shift sells gold okay
so i wouldn't uh i wouldn't buy this
opinion
um
i saw a tweet thread from yuri dagan i
think
who did a deep dive on dr malone's claim
to be the inventor of the mr mrna
platform
how do you think that turned out
what do you think happened
when somebody did a deep dive and looked
at all the patents and
what names are on them and what the
dates are and how important they are
did it turn out to
back dr malone's claim that he would be
one of the inventors of the mrna
platform
yeah it did
it did
his name is indeed
on a number of patents
that are in that field now as other
people have said there were thousands of
people who contributed in different ways
but
you really need to read this thread
because
if you don't understand how names get on
patents
you need to
all right how many of you have big
company experience and have been through
the patent process
i have
what happens
what happens when
you're a worker
and
you have a patent idea
and you come up with a good idea you're
a worker at a big company
whose names are on the patent it's your
idea only you're the only one who did
anything useful
some other people helped in ancillary
ways
whose name is that's right
your boss's name is on the patent isn't
it what did your boss do
maybe assigned you to looking into a
field or something maybe didn't
but it is standard procedure to put the
boss's name on a patent
just because the boss could make you do
it
hey i'm part of this team and my team
did this
so i'm gonna put my name on there
now what about somebody who is just on
the team
do you think that anybody ever got their
name on a patent
because they attended meetings
and maybe just did what they were told
yes
routinely
it's very common for multiple names to
be on the patent
do you think all of the multiple names
on the patent did something useful
or were they just sort of
on the team
well i won't give away the details but
if you look at i tweeted this you can
find it in my
twitter thread
if you look for yuri dagan's take on
this he goes through a great deal of
analysis
and his bottom line if i could
characterize it this way is that
dr malone is uh what you call a team
player
which means he was definitely on the
team
he attended the meetings and he worked
on it i mean i'm not saying he did
nothing he obviously did he did things
that mattered enough to get him on the
patent
and in one case the allegation is that
one of his key patents
was just something that the real
inventor told him to do and he just
executed it
so in one case he may have executed
something that was actually somebody
else's idea
now
i'm not going to allege that any of the
claims of dr malone are true or those of
his
let's say i won't say a critic but
somebody who looked into it i can't i
can't tell you who's right
but i will tell you that the very moment
i heard that he was claiming these
patents
how many of you with corporate
experience said
his name's on the patent
does that mean anything
how many of you said that to yourself
silently okay all i know is his name's
on it that doesn't mean anything
could have been the boss
right yeah everybody with corporate
experience knew that wasn't really a
thing
but we can neither confirm nor deny that
his work was important it's just a
question
do you the cdc now is getting really
weasely on
whether their numbers of covet deaths
are real or exaggerated because they
would include some number of people who
died with covet instead of because of
what would be your guess of the
percentage of over
if there isn't over count even that's
uncertain
but if you had to guess
just knowing based on your i don't know
understanding of life
you've lived it for a while you've seen
things that work and things that don't
we don't really have any information
but what's your guess
of how over-accounted it is
all right i'm seeing less of everything
from 25 to 50.
yeah
and how how over counted would it have
to be
before you would say to yourself
we did everything wrong
uh here's my take
if it turns out that we overcounted by
20
i would say that doesn't really matter
to me
how many of you would be concerned and
this is just hypothetical
if we found out as if we could know that
really probably never have good data but
if it was 20 over counted
would you be concerned
because i think we would have acted the
same way
if it were
50 percent over counted
so that it let's say it was half as much
as they reported
then would you say we overreacted
then it starts to get it's sort of a
jump ball isn't it
and if it's 80 over counted
well then we really overacted
we really overacted
i'm gonna i'm gonna put uh
put out a prediction
this is not based on anything
that i could point to other than living
in the world
so this is just a living in the world
experiential
just best guess
25 percent over counted
now could i be wrong
yeah
yeah
so
it when you judge me for being wrong on
this one which seems likely by the way
because we're all we would all be
guessing on this one when you judge me
wrong just remember that i told you that
we would all have to just guess on this
one so the
the predictions that i make that you
should give a little more credibility
is when i give a reason
like the trump the trump uh winning in
2016 i showed you my work but i'm not
showing you any work here i'm just
saying oh it just feels like
we couldn't be that incompetent
to be that far off
but maybe it's not impossible
now there's also an argument that they
were undercounted and the undercurrent
argument says how do you know what you
don't know
what if people were dying at home
and nobody tested them
are there people who died at the age of
95
at home
who were not tested for covet
probably
don't you think you don't think somebody
died at 95 at home
you know just suddenly heart attack or
whatever
and that they might have had coven and
it might have been the reason
but who's going to test you if you're 95
because it doesn't matter right
you just say well
it doesn't matter
then there are lots of testing at home
and now reporting yeah you've got that
too our numbers are a mess that's the
only thing we know for sure well did you
see the story about a small plane at a
emergency landing in
la
now if you have a mechanical problem i
assume it was a mechanical problem but
very small i don't know maybe a piper
cub or something very small plane and he
had to do an emergency landing and he
pulled it off
so imagine imagine having to land an
airplane with no engine which is
probably what happened
but it looks like he pulled it off he
glided into a
must have found some roads or something
and
the trouble is that where he came to
rest
was on a train track
this really happened
a guy did a crash successful
i'll call it a crash landing because but
the plane wasn't destroyed
he landed it well enough that the plane
was intact
but it was on the train track
and he he survived he was kind of beaten
up
uh
but the train was coming
that's right
he landed his plane successfully
on a train track
and
the train was coming
the emergency crew was there quick
enough and as the train was coming
they struggled to get him out of the
plane
because he was you know strapped in
they got him out
and then the plane and then the train
took out the plane
the pla the train took the plane apart
like it was made of balsa wood which
they almost are because they're they're
made to be light
it was a
cessna 172
was it
sony it didn't look like it
huh
um
and and he
i don't know how well the guy was doing
but he was alive when they took him out
of the plane and it looked like he would
have survived
so the fact that this was on video is is
just amazing you have to see it just
google that if you haven't seen it
um
so was it remind me is this true
was there a time
when people were pointing to australia
as the model of good leadership in the
in the pandemic
and that
australia was following the science
better than other people
um
so am i right about that
that people were saying australia was
like a big success story or something
and now they've turned into this you
know dystopian nightmare
police state situation and of course
they're not going to be able to stop
omicron
so remember i'm the one who told you
that you wouldn't see leadership
in the results
that we'll never know why some countries
did better than others the variables are
too mixed up
but i don't think
australia will be the model of
leadership but how about china
china did that hard close down after
wuhan that they being the source of the
virus you think they would be hit the
hardest but indeed
reportedly had tremendous success in
locking down and blocking the alpha and
the delta
but it turns out that they've got
omicron problem and as you know omicron
doesn't uh stop for anything
so now china has the beginning of an
omicron wave they're doing the same
strategy of shutting down which i
believe couldn't possibly work
am i wrong
that you you might get a result
temporarily with delta and the alpha
version that the lockdowns might make a
difference and maybe even the mass make
a difference and maybe even the social
distancing make a difference
but it's not going to make a difference
for omicron
it's going to just tear right through
your vaccinations and everything else
so
the timing is that there's going to be a
massive omicron wave in china i think
i don't know how it could be avoided
at the same time as what i call the
omicron olympics
they are so screwed
i would not want to be china right now
they are so screwed this omicron is
going to make things really
sketchy
and as people are arguing that omicron
makes
arguments about vaccine mandates just
irrelevant
i i feel as if
the supreme court could just say well
omicron makes vaccinations irrelevant so
just forget about your mandates
because i think there's a legal case for
that now
that the situation before
is that you can make a reasonable case
that if you got vaccinated you'd have
some protection
but if omicron's the only thing we're
worried about at scale you know we still
be worried about some
delta uh breaking through
but at scale the only thing we're going
to be worried about pretty soon is
omicron and your vaccination isn't going
to stop it and it's not going to kill
you in all likelihood
so i feel like the the argument for any
kind of uh mandates
is just dissolving just dissolving
um
how many of you think that the omicron
is a natural variant i asked this
question
on
twitter and it was roughly half
half of you thought it was natural and
half of you didn't now here's the
argument for natural
all viruses go this way
that eventually the way any virus dies
out is that it creates its own own
vaccine basically
in a sense so the viru the virus will
mutate until you've got one that travels
fast
and infects lightly
and then herd immunity happens and
everything's good
so on so one argument is
it happened
pretty much exactly when you'd expect it
to
the variant emerged it has exactly the
characteristics you'd expect it to have
and it's acting the way you
you would think it would
so that argues for natural right
i would
i would point you to uh the ethical
skeptic
just google his account
and follow his takes on the science when
they look at the
they look at the nature of the omicron
variant
and the the argument is if you look at
it closely there just isn't any way it
could be natural
now this is people who know more than i
do
looking at things i can't see
so
people who know more than you looking at
things you can't see
might be right
they might not be but i think the
argument looks pretty strong
not conclusive i would not be at the
point of concluding
it's man-made
but damn it looks man-made to me i mean
it just looks a little
it's just so on the nose
it's hard to imagine it's not
but it could be it could be the argument
that it's natural is uh strong and still
active
but
i think i think it's gonna go the other
way
if i if i had to put money on it i'd say
it's it was made in the lab if i had to
bet
all right um
let's talk about the patriot front
so i asked how many of you thought the
patriot front was a real group so
there's they're the handsome tall
fit young white men
who do these
very theatrical marches with flags as
white nationalists
but people don't kind of know too much
about them well it turns out that the
southern poverty law center does know a
little bit about them or purports to
and has a report on them and here's how
they describe
the uh patriot front this is from
southern poverty law center patriot
front is an image obsessed organization
an image obsessed organization keep that
in mind they're image obsessed
that rehabilitated the explicitly
fascist agenda of vanguard
america i guess that was some other
racist group with garish patriotism
patriarch focuses on the theatrical
rhetoric and activism that can be easily
distributed as propaganda for its
chapters across the country
now
how does that how does that fit with
what you saw
i feel as if image obsessed
is a little too convenient
meaning
how many racist groups that have this
actual ideology
could be this organized
and this theatrical
i don't think so
i don't think so
maybe
maybe
anything's possible
but when you tell me that they're uh
that they're image obsessed it also
looks like a lincoln project
uh fake out doesn't it
i mean
what would be the difference between
somebody who's trying really hard to
look like a proper racist
and somebody who was faking it by trying
really hard to look like a racist
so
so so the explanation is
they're not fake racists trying to look
like real racists
they're real racist
that are faking looking like real racist
because they didn't look like real
racist enough
so they have to improve their image of
racist to look really racist in a proper
way
which is totally different from somebody
who's not a racist who also does exactly
the same things to look like look
exactly the same way but their motives
would be different one would be fake and
the other would be real but trying to
look more real than they actually are
real
in a in a positive way for them
is that does that track for you
all right here's another hint
apparently the same group the patriot
front was involved with and marched at
charlottesville
how about that
you know that totally organic and
totally credible
exactly the way it was reported and
nothing was left out story about the
charlottesville march in which there was
nothing suspicious about that group
whatsoever
turns out that uh
part of them were this patriot frogged
yeah so the people who pretend to look
more like racists than they
uh allege they already are
were part of the charlottesville event
which to me looked like people
pretending to be racists
and sure enough it was people pretending
to be racist
now
the allegation is they were pretending
to be racists
and actually were
but they were like putting on more of a
show
then maybe they would have ordinarily
do you buy it
i don't buy any of this
so i've never believed that the
charlottesville thing
was
reported correctly i don't know what's
missing but if i had to guess it would
be an intelligence agency
maybe this country
maybe another country
and there's a complete lack of reporting
after the event like people talking to
the members who are there like complete
the the news has completely shut out the
event in terms of the participants
think of all the stories you've heard
about the january 6 participants
look at all the energy that went into
finding those participants on january 6
none of that happened as far as i know
because it wasn't in the news anyway i
don't think any of that happened for
charlottesville
why
oh because i think a number of the
people at charlottesville were
maybe acting
now
if they were part of the patriot front
they were acting
but were also racist
so there's something deeply sketchy
about all of this
because
i
i've met people who are this racist
and they can't pull this off
you know what i mean
[Laughter]
you know they're all forms of racism
but the one you see you know the the
sort of uh
i don't know the baseline racism that
everybody has just the normal stuff
those people could often be uh highly
educated
and just have a boring fears or
sometimes not depending on your point of
view but
i don't know if you could get this many
racists
to
act this well and then you look at their
written
their written stuff
and even the written stuff looks a
little too well written if you know what
i mean
so
uh
yeah it looks like we may be going from
one false flag to another
now i don't know that all the
participants are false
i would imagine that there are people
who are behind the participants either
funding it or encouraging it or
controlling just the leaders or
something like that but there's
definitely something going on with these
these
things because they just don't look real
they just do not look real
um and my favorite story of the day was
the pan
uh the college pen they had a trans uh
swimmer
uh a woman who uh
lost to yale's trans swimmer
now
does anybody remember one of my
predictions early on when we were
talking about all the trans stuff
i said that if a team starts winning
with a trans athlete that every every
serious team is going to get a trans
athlete because they want to win too
so
you may see
you may see it for a while anyway i
don't know that this will last you might
see this weird situation where winning
is more important you know in the short
term
where you actually see recruiting
do you think that there's any college
that's actively recruiting trans
athletes because i think it'll give them
an advantage
i'll bet there is
i'll bet somewhere
there's a college who is actively
looking for trans athletes because they
know they have a better chance of
winning
why wouldn't they
you know it may you know i'm not saying
that penn did this or yale did this
i have no no reason to believe that
but somebody's going to do this and when
somebody does they're just going to win
everything
and then what are the other schools to
do
do you think that you would comp you
would continue competing and losing
when you put a lot of money into your
school program and it meant a lot and
stuff but you're just getting your ass
kicked by all the other schools because
they have trans athletes
i think you have to get one
don't you
you're almost going to have to
have to compete
so
um i say again as i've said often
the whole trans thing is um
it's a diversion from what our real
problems are
we have two problems that i've said are
huge problems forever before the trans
were even involved in it number one our
bathrooms are all designed wrong without
the proper amount of privacy
that's number one our bathrooms are all
designed wrong there should be a way
everybody who has you know got the shy
bladder
or the trans or anything else
whatever you got going on
ideally you should be able to have a
private bathroom that doesn't bother
anybody else
secondly sports are broken
you should only be competing with people
who are the same level of talent
no matter what
if you can't fix that
don't complain about the trans
the trans just highlighted the fact that
the way we organize sports was never
right in the first place
that we shouldn't be giving
uh scholarships for sports
like if we if it were not a tradition to
do that and somebody came up with the
idea
you wouldn't be in favor of it
let's say there had never been any
school sports and somebody said let's
let's start a school sport
and the the best ones will get free
scholarships
and you'd be there thinking
what
well i don't play that sport are you
telling me you're going to introduce a
new thing that only people who are not
meek and maybe get a scholarship
how about giving me a scholarship for
what i'm good at how about how about
something about academics or
or being on the school paper how about
that
like
why are we all getting excited about
some small group of people who have a
talent that i don't have
i don't think that you could introduce
school sports
if you knew what they were like if you
could describe them as we see them in
2022
and then you could go back in time where
they never existed and said this is what
we want to get to
so here's my idea
we're going to introduce sports
and then if everything works out we'll
be exactly what we see in 2022.
nobody would approve of that
we only drifted into this weird
situation and then the trans thing just
just uncovered the fact that we have a
poorly constructed system that's all it
was
blaming the trans for a bad system
doesn't seem fair to me
now i also had this conversation the
other day
uh
one of the reasons and maybe the biggest
reason
that i'm super pro trans
is that i imagine how
uh
i would have felt i'll just make it
personal how would i have felt if i was
a person born in the 30s
i don't know pick your pick your year in
the past and somebody said
um
i think black people should be able to
play baseball
like and i'm something like racist from
the 30s or something
like how would i feel about that
well i think that was a bad idea
probably because i would be a product of
my time
product of my time and i'd be laughing i
hate that
then how would i feel if i were
similarly sometime in the past and
somebody said uh women want the right to
vote
and i'd be some old-timey
you know sexist i'd be like what
women voting
that's crazy talk
next thing you know everything will be
woke
no i wouldn't have said that
but
but when i hear people talking about
trans
to me it sounds the same
i don't know if it is the same because
i'm i'm the guy who tells you don't use
analogies to make decisions
but i'm very concerned that i don't want
to be that guy in the 20s you know what
i mean
so a little bit is about myself it's not
even about the topic it's about who you
want to be when you grow up
and i don't want to be the one
who ever looks back and says
god i felt i used to be like really had
a bad feeling about trans people
but now i realize it's just it's like
everything else like you know it's like
gay black women voting you just get used
to stuff and then you realize it was
never a problem in the first place
right so i feel as though we're x number
of years away from trans not being a
conversation
at all
and i just want to get a free i want to
get ahead of it i don't want to be the
guy
who figured it out later that's all
now
somebody says it's wishy-washy
i don't think that was very wishy-washy
that was pretty direct i think
somebody says a pushover wait hold on oh
i see your problem i see your problem
you're saying
that
i'm not saying we should give trans
everything they're asking for
did that sound like what you heard
god no
i i don't say give anybody everything
they're asking for i don't say
you know just because you're gay you get
what you're asking for or you're black
or you're a woman or something
i'd not say that
i'm not saying that i necessarily agree
that they should be on the women's team
i'm not saying that i necessarily agree
they should have the same you know
restroom privileges i just say it's a
problem i wish we could fix it
but don't assume the problem is the
trans the problem might be the system
but i agree with you that if there's
anything about how we navigate you know
who can do what if any of it's
inconvenient for you or your family
complain i would
there's there's nothing that says trans
got to get what they want
like i'm not making that argument
at all
right everybody's got to fight for what
they they get we our system is about
power it's not about what's fair
so if they accumulate enough power to
get what they want then they'll get it
if they don't they won't
but i'm not arguing they should get what
they want
everybody has to fight for what they
want that's not my job
dr malone's name is on the patents that
is correct
as are lots of people who didn't have
much to do with them typically with
patents there are people whose names are
on them that did not have a lot to do
with them
that's an ordinary situation
but at least one of those names probably
did have a lot to do with them you just
can't tell by looking at the pattern
all right
um
oh that's interesting somebody was
talking about moving into trans humans
yeah you know when we become uh part
machine and part people
the the trans argument is just going to
seem silly
like it'll feel like
just so trivial because we'll be half
robot
anyway that's all i got for today
i'm sure this is the best show you've
ever seen and ever we'll see
and uh
john abramson podcast with rogan i
haven't seen that now
but i will talk to you youtubers
tomorrow
