good morning everybody
and it's time for one of your
favorite things
yeah coffee with scott adams today
you'll hear about the headlines you will
have fun you will you'll be entertained
you'll be stimulated and amused all of
those things every one of them and all
you need to make it special is a copper
mug or glass a tanker chelsea style you
know can't enjoy a flash of vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
being here today the thing that makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous sip and watch it work go
wait wait we have a special request
i saw this go by on the locals platform
the special request is that sometimes a
sip is not enough can we agree on that
it's not enough
so today i'd like to introduce
thanks to a follower recommendation the
simultaneous slurp everybody one more
time except go big
[Music]
ah
yeah
that was both disgusting
and exhilarating at the same time
you don't get that often
well let's talk about all the things
first of all i'm i'm now
streaming on two platforms locals and
youtube i tried to stream on rumble have
you heard of it
rumble is a sort of a video streaming
service
competes with youtube
let's see if i get uh demonetized
one two three yeah should be happening
about now
um
but here's the process for me to become
a live streamer on rumble
if you want to be a producer you click a
button
to
to request whatever they need to make
you a producer
and then the way the process works is
that after you've clicked that button
nothing happens
and then the next day nothing happens
they may or may not be sending mail to
my spam i don't know but if you'd like
to see me on rumble
could you talk to somebody at rumble and
say
i don't know how to get on there i'll
click the button i suppose you might be
sending me email that i don't see
but your process is not quite connecting
the dots so i would be
i would be live streaming there if i
could
um
remember i told you that a lifelong
weird dream of mine came true
this is the weirdest thing you know i've
told you
too many stories about uh unusual
successes in my life
things which uh were totally unlikely
such as becoming a famous cartoonist
being a number one
author
you know best-selling author getting
invited to the white house so i've had
all these weird weird things and the
weirdest of all
was i always had a
a dream to be a lyricist
and apparently that that came true
without any effort on my part because
some of my podcast stuff has been turned
into music
uh by adding music to it and the product
is called meaning wave you could just
google it and you'll you'll find the
music
by akira the dawn
and there's some new music coming out
but
akira messaged me and reminded me that
here i'd been crowing about the fact
that
i had accomplished this highly unusual
goal
of being a lyricist with no musical
training
i don't even listen to music much i mean
rarely
and
it was the most unlikely goal i've ever
had in my life
and it actually happened
but as akira pointed out there's
something even more unlikely about it
that i somehow
i
missed my uh
somehow i didn't even notice
that i'm also a vocalist
because it's my actual voice that
appears in the in the songs that was
just samples of my voice
but what were the odds that i would go
from literally not being able to speak
i'll remind you of this story many of
you have already heard it
a number of years ago i lost the ability
to speak for about three and a half
years
to a rare condition called spasmodic
dysphonia long story short i found the
only doctor in the world who had a
surgery
experimental surgery to fix it and i
became one of the first people in the
world
to fix that problem
but my affirmations at the time is that
i scott will speak perfectly
now that seemed unlikely because i
didn't speak perfectly before i got the
spasmodic dysphonia it was kind of
nasally and you know nobody really
wanted to hear my voice
but because i did lots of voice training
before the surgery and took years to
rehab it
the weirdest thing happened i'm a
professional vocalist now
well not professional because i didn't
get paid for it but but there's an
actual commercial song
with my voice on it
that's actually music
literally
my voice is music
now if you told me that that goal
could have actually happened
when i couldn't speak
just keep in mind put the context on
this
that when i couldn't speak
i had a very specific affirmation that i
repeated every day
that i scott will speak perfectly
i'm actually
featured on music
i can't get i can't this is blowing my
mind
so hard that you can't even believe it i
suppose this is this is more for me than
it is for you
all right how about more more about you
so apparently the california governor
recall race is uh really going to be
close and larry elder looks to be the
leading person to take the job
if newsom doesn't get uh if newsom does
get recalled
and here's here's my take on
the strangest thing about this story
it's another one of these uh the dog not
barking
has anyone mentioned
that larry elder is black
right
it's not even a story
and if it gets mentioned at all and
literally i've never even heard a
mention
how do you have
a black guy running for a governor
probably will win
and
should we take a moment to celebrate
should we take a moment to celebrate
that being black wasn't even part of the
question
or if it was
it was considered an advantage
am i right
if you thought about it for a minute
and you said to yourself hey larry
elder's running for governor he's black
didn't you think that would help him
you did didn't you
i mean think about it
think about how far we've come
right lots of work to do blah blah blah
blah we're not saying you know i'm not
saying you know systemic racism is
solved or anything like that but just
think about the fact
that the guy who might be governor in
just a few weeks i mean there's a really
good shot
he's running as a black man and nobody
cared and if they did care they thought
it was a positive at least politically
so i don't know i feel like that's
super noteworthy because it's not being
talked about
specifically
yeah the less is talked about the
happier we are where are all the where
is the narrative about all the the
racist republicans
aren't the republicans all supposed to
be a bunch of racists
so how could it be
that the very the moment larry elder
entered the race the moment he entered
the race
he took the lead
where are all the racist republicans
is there anybody who who cares about his
race i don't think so except in a
positive way
um
another question
do you remember it wasn't that many
years ago when the biggest debate it
seemed like in public
was about teaching intelligent design in
schools
whatever happened to that
but
i noted in a tweet that once elon musk
told you that you were you were almost
certainly a simulated uh reality and
that you were probably programmed by
some other intelligence
kind of ruined the whole topic didn't it
i i feel like you can't have that debate
anymore
as soon as you throw in the the
the
well the
statistical
near certainty that we are a simulation
created by some other form of
intelligence
and by the way that argument is just
based on math and common sense
that if one simulation could be created
and we know we'll be able to make one in
my lifetime we'll be able to make a
simulation where the the creatures in it
i think they're real because they were
programmed to think they're real
if we can make one they're going to be
more than one
might mean millions of them could be
trillions of them if you make a good
enough simulation the people in the
simulation can make their own simulation
or they think they did
so it seems like the question of
intelligent design we can't even have
the argument anymore because the
simulation theory just ruined the
argument anyway i just point out that
there are some things you think are the
most important thing in the world and
then they can just go away on their own
i don't even know what happened
um
somebody said
i'm looking in the comments
um
oh okay well never mind i thought it was
a different comment
question
um well before we get to that i love
watching
fox news and cnn fight
i don't know there's it's one of the
most amusing things
um i think i was a
uh probably an outlier in the sense that
uh i liked watching chris cuomo and his
brother uh do their little show on cnn
if you don't take it seriously and you
shouldn't because obviously that's not
real news but just watching the two
successful brothers banter
i liked it
i know you didn't i'm not telling you
you should like what i like i'm just
telling you i liked it from an
entertainment perspective i didn't take
any of the news part of it seriously
but
um
here's some more of that little back and
forth between fox news and cnn
so apparently uh
chris cuomo's show
is just uh hemorrhaging female voter
female viewers which is no surprise
since he sported his brother and his
brother was accused of uh some a lot of
me too stuff
so
cuomo prime time i guess
average 86 000 female viewers in the in
the age group that they want the most
and last week it was down 33 percent
compared to the second quarter totals
wow
a key demographic
was down 33 percent because of what his
brother did
wow
and down uh stunning as fox says a
stunning
56
compared to the last year
now mostly compared to last year's
because trump was in the news that's not
not anything to do with cnn per se
but here's what i like about this fox
news refers to
chris cuomo as quote
the troubled cnn's troubled anchor
troubled anchor
now here's what i'm at here's my
question do you ever see cnn use
disgraced
they'll throw in disgrace in front of
you know somebody's name or or title
as if it's just the fact that they're
disgraced
um
what is the dividing line between being
troubled
being a troubled anchor and being a
disgraced anchor
what's the dividing line
where it is troubled turned into
disgrace
because you know
if if this had been reversed
i feel like cnn would have called you
know let's say if it happened to you
know if hannity had a brother who was a
uh a governor or if if typhoon carlson
had a brother who was a governor i think
they would call them the disgraced
anchor
disgraced
so this is a little persuasion trick for
you
just insert disgraced
in front of anybody you don't like
let me give you an example
disgraced president biden
talked about the afghanistan withdrawal
debacle
pretty
good um
uh
oh well it looks like i'm already
getting some help connecting on rumble
thank you amanda
um
back to the news
can we all get doctor's notes to wear no
masks
and if we can't
why not
why not
why can't you go to the doctor and say
let's say i'll use myself as an example
doctor
i'm fit
and healthy
and i've been vaccinated
recently so it hasn't even worn off
and i i find it very disturbing to wear
masks and it itches my face and makes me
psychologically unhappy
etc
can i get my doctor to write me a note
and says oh yeah okay you don't need a
mask
because
yes it would help perhaps it would help
but
all things considered you've looked at
your risks your rewards and as your
doctor i
i certify your choice yes there's some
extra risk
of not wearing the mask would say my
doctor i imagine my doctor would say
that but
it's a low risk
and uh i i signed your note saying that
you can take that risk you're it's a
reasonable risk
why can't i do that
and if i did do that
who's going to fight with my doctor
right
let's say you go into your uh your
employer
and your employer says you have to wear
a mask you can't come in he says oh yes
i know that here's my note
from my doctor can your employer
override your doctor
i mean they can
right because
if it's a private company they make
their own rules they can
but would they
turley says no oh interesting i'm saying
in the comments that jonathan turley
says no now the reason i stopped
is because there are just a few people
in the world
who if they have an opinion i just stop
and say okay
they're probably right
um
oh thank you
um
so they're probably right
sorry getting a lot of getting a lot of
help here today
so if turley says that a doctor's note
would be good enough not to wear a mask
and i think he's right right how do you
overrule a doctor's note
what employer is going to overrule a
doctor's note i just don't see it
happening so i feel
i feel i feel like i guess better turn
off my alerts i'm getting a lot of help
on rumble today
um
i feel as if we could all get a doctor's
note
now
have you ever tried to get a doctor's
prescription for a weed
if you live in a state where you need a
doctor to get weed you probably already
know this
there are specialists
that's right there are weed doctors at
least in california probably other
places
so a weed doctor
basically just
does one thing and you just go in hey i
need some weed they do a you know brief
question about your health and look at
your health records and then they say
yes or no now why couldn't we have mask
specialist doctors let's say a retired
doctor
who just wants to put in an you know 800
number
do telehealth right do it by phone and
you call your doctor and you say hey
here's my situation can i get a note
why not
would we see that popping up i mean it
would be short-term business we hope
but
you would expect the market to respond
to that
um
i looked at the headlines today i was
looking at all the
looking for all the deaths
how many of you can answer the following
questions
how many people on average so in the
comments i want to see how informed you
are in the comments tell me
how many people
per day die in the united states from
all costs so we're not talking about the
pandemic yet
but from all causes how many people per
day
die in the united states go put it in
the comments and let me see if you're
close
i'll read out some of them i'm saying
800 8 000 8 000 10 000 2
2500 these are all your guesses 20 000
50 000 1000.
all right you're all over the board
all over the board the correct answer is
approximately 8 000 per day
all right so you're going to be the
first
bunch of people who ever heard context
on the pandemic
tell me if you've heard this anywhere
else
that about 8 000 people a day or die
from all causes now your second question
is how many of the 8 thousand
are dying at the moment you know that
could go up but at the moment how many
are dying per day out of the eight
thousand
from covent
covid is how many of the eight thousand
go in the comments i'll read your
comments i'm saying zero five hundred
two hundred a thousand one hundred eight
thousand
three hundred
uh five hundred ten
all right so your guesses are all over
the board the answer is about a thousand
so about one thousand
of the eight thousand people who are
dying every day
at the moment
one out of eight
is dying of covet
now
do you count that one out of eight the
same as you count the other people
well probably because that seems fair
but we have to also
include the fact that these are people
who might have only lived another year
if they're elderly for example they
might have had only a few years left
so that thousand people is dying is a
little misleading
because if you looked at life years
denied you know a child would have maybe
80 years ahead of them
a senior citizen might have won
so what happens if the of the 800 of the
thousand people who died what happens if
800 of them
only had a couple years left
there's more like a few hundred people
dying isn't it
it's more like a few hundred
because
the people who only lost a year or two
you have to count that i mean if you're
doing
you know life and death math you don't
you don't get the choice of oh everybody
lives
got to make choices
and i think we're the fact that this
isn't in the headline and instead we're
talking about icu beds should tell us
that the news is manipulating us and
trying to tell us it's a bigger problem
that it is
now
is the icu beds problem
a problem
well i think the new york times said uh
i think uh 20 of the hospitals are
having capacity problems with the icus
but
what does that mean
well in many cases it means that they
just repurpose other space
it doesn't mean that they turn you away
if you go to the hospital you'll still
get treated even even with the hospitals
that are over capacity they'll just open
up another
they might keep you in the emergency
room they might open up another wing or
something it will impact other stuff
but the other hospitals that are not
impacted probably you could still go
there
so there's at least some flexibility
so
um definitely the icu beds are a problem
but what we don't get is reporting on
how much
capability hospitals have to handle
surges if you're looking at one of the
other benefits of the pandemic
is that we learned how to handle surges
think about it every every major
hospital in every city
probably i'm guessing
by now has a pretty detailed plan of
what it looks like to have to surge your
icu capacity
you know up by 30 or something i bet
every hospital knows how to do it now
they know exactly which space to use
now of course staffing would be a
problem because
that you can't surge staff
too easily
but anyway that's the full situation
um
i got a new mascot
now
a lot of you say hey you're a podcaster
why do you need a mascot well i didn't
really need one
but i got one
um
so somebody says norway tested and found
out that the r for this is lower than
the regular flu i don't know about that
anyway my mascot is twitter user anomaly
some of you have heard him
he's my critic but he refuses to tell me
what we disagree with
he's very very sure
that if he would debate me in public
he would embarrass me
but he gave me four things that he
disagrees with me let's go through them
number one he says anomaly says me you
are wrong about sweden and i was right
to which i say
wrong about what
the sweden exists
can you give me a hint
what was it that i said that you
disagreed with
i don't even know so number one
is something about sweden
i have no idea what that is so i can't
respond to that number two he said
you're wrong about saying the that the
unvaccinated are in a pandemic and
you're not
well that was my opinion
of how i feel
when i'm vaccinated
when i got vaccinated i felt as though i
was no longer in a pandemic well you
guys are if you're unvaccinated now
was that a fact no
was it
uh reasoning
no
it was literally how i feel
so anomaly is arguing with me about how
i feel
i feel like i could win that argument
anomaly
i think he feels this way scott how do
you feel not that way
end of end of debate
number three
that
says anomaly you need to get in line for
your booster shot soon
okay
and what was the part i disagreed with
what was it was i arguing that i like
booster shots i sure wish we had booster
shots
or was i arguing that they would never
happen
i don't recall even thinking about it so
what exactly are we disagreeing about
i don't know and then number four
israel is having more cases and that's
this august than last august without the
jab
now this is obviously a cherry-picked
data but let me ask you this
do you think israel wishes they had not
vaccinated
do you think the the experts in israel
anomaly do you think that they're not
happy they vaccinated as much as they
did do you think that they think it was
a mistake
why is it that nobody in the medical
profession in israel
knows what anomaly knows that it was all
a big sham and i guess those
vaccinations didn't help
but israel itself doesn't know that
anyway so i would like to call anomaly a
critic but he doesn't actually criticize
anything that's even slightly sensible
so i'm going to call him a mascot
for now
rasmussen
did a poll on voter regrets for 2020 the
presidential race so i guess uh
conservatives and liberals were about
the same
six percent of conservatives and five
percent of liberals had some regret but
twelve percent of moderates
who decides elections
moderates right it's the moderates that
at least have the ability to to swing
both ways the others the liberals and
conservatives mostly not
but
the moderates 12 regret
that's pretty big let's dig down a
little bit
turns out according to rasmussen that uh
70 of the people that they surveyed
that's not the national thing but of
people that they surveyed
um 70 percent
said they uh voted for biden 77 70 of
black citizens
but only 54 said they would now
the black support for biden just crashed
why
what happened
wasn't wasn't biden the antidote to
trump
except what happened
i think the only thing that people know
about biden is he's trying to get him
vaccinated and a lot of them don't like
it
maybe
maybe what happened was everything you
heard about trump
you realize was
maybe
maybe all those things you thought would
go wrong under trump
turned out to be like
you know uh opportunity zones he funded
and he you know trump funded the
historically black colleges
you know he had
i mean he didn't do anything you don't
like
trump actually
killed it
for you know prison reforms thank you
yeah
trump consistently rolled out one thing
after another that sounded pretty good
to black people because it was
what's biden done
well biden has one accomplishment he
made black lives matter stop protesting
but nothing changed
they just stopped protesting
so
maybe the black population is noticing
that they they got taken by the the news
industry
well the golden age is still
possible
um it turns out that moderna
you know of course they created one of
the mrna
vaccines they're going to start human
trials for an hiv vaccine
because it uses the same technology
so i guess everything we learned about
hiv after 37 years of studying it
made us smart enough to create the mrna
platform for the
pandemic
but then what we learned in the pandemic
made us smart enough that we could
circle back and work on aids
and apparently apparently there's some
kind of virtuous circle of science
um that somebody else pointed out not me
i didn't write down the name i wish i
had but uh
this is kind of cool
and correct me if i'm wrong but i think
this platform has some potential for
cancer or some forms of cancer
so this is big
let me tell you another one that you
didn't see coming i didn't see it coming
i uh do you have any any of you have any
kids in school
what happened when your kids went back
to school after a year of virtual
learning
tell me in the comments
first week of school
kids happy or unhappy tell me in the
comments
uh
let's see
just tell me happy or unhappy
in the comments first happy
love that yeah happy happy happy happy
happy happy happy happy oh well yeah
you're getting some colds i guess
um yeah you know what else happened
um
at least i this is anecdotal but i'd
love to hear it from you
uh a lot of the cliques you know the
little groups the kids form
they dissolved
and people were able to make new friends
that maybe they could not have
penetrated before there's something
about the pandemic that rebooted
the social structure of the kids
because they lost their friends during
the pandemic or they you know modified
their friend group and now they're going
back almost like it's new
because you can get really locked out of
a group
but what i'm i'm being told that
everybody's being more welcoming than
they normally had been so here's some
advice for your kids
do you have any kids in school here's
the advice
more for the teens
go make some friends
go talk to some people who wouldn't have
talked to you two years ago
everybody seems to be more open and it
might be a limited window
where everybody's just a little more
flexible because they're just so damn
happy to see other people
so go make some friends
you'll never have if you're a teenager
your whole life you'll never have a
better time to make a friend this this
could be the best time to make a friend
all right um jeffrey toobin uh
so you may remember
i might be the only person who gave a
full-throated uh defense of jeffrey
toobin's uh job
when he got in trouble for his little
zoom masturbation thing
i said let's not make that a career
ending thing let's just call that a
human moment
let's not make that about his job and
and i don't know anybody else who said
that
i i don't know did anybody else say
let him keep his job
but i did
and now i'm glad
because he came out with a
an article on cnn in which he says he
doesn't think trump should be charged
with any crimes for the january 6 stuff
boy did people not like that
do you know what reasons jeffrey tubin
gave for why trump should not be charged
with a crime
there wasn't any evidence of a
crime he wrote this for cnn
so cnn spared jeffrey toobin
and you know i don't think this is
literally true but it but it looks like
i'll just say it looks like
for fun
it looks like they said okay we're going
to spare you
but you need to do one suicide mission
for us in return
and he was like i don't like that deal
but it's the best i'll get and the
suicide mission is
tubin has to explain are you ready for
this this is fun
toobin has to explain on behalf of cnn
why everything they've reported about
trump breaking all the laws
was not true
so tuban
has to take the arrows
for informing cnn's audience that
everything they've told them about trump
so far is a lie because there's no
chance of him getting prosecuted for
anything
here are the reasons
it's ambiguous that he wanted any
violence because he said
go march but don't be violent
how do you get
how do you get prosecuted for inciting
violence when you said don't be violent
and jeffrey toobin correctly points out
i mean i'm no lawyer but it sounds
pretty logical to me
that if you didn't say do violence and
you said don't do violence it's going to
be hard to say you were in favor of
violence
it's ambiguous and certainly well beyond
the you know reasonable doubt standard
um
and let's see what it what else so he
didn't
do that
and anything he told let's say the
attorney general to do
if trump believed what he was telling
the attorney general to say
which is that the election was
fraudulent that's what trump wanted him
to say
if trump believed that was true
there's no crime
telling your attorney general to tell
the truth
as you see it even if you're wrong it's
not a crime
not a crime
so
as
uh as as tuban correctly points out
there's literally no evidence of a crime
now that doesn't mean no crime happened
i'm just saying there's no evidence of
one
and he had to be the guy the sacrificial
lamb
who went out and told the cnn's audience
you know everything we've been telling
you for a while it's kind of
there's no crime here
and he did a good job anyway so i find
that i am proud to have supported
jeffrey tubin's
uh career
and still am
because i think he gave us a straight he
gave us a strange story on this
somebody says it was a stroke of genius
all right yes the puns
fall like water
so of course cnn has to target whoever
is the strongest gop candidate for
president next time which is ron
desantis if not trump so if trump runs
of course he'll get nominated
but desantis would be the obvious number
two
and so chrysalis is going after ron
desantis for
getting rid of masked mandates in
schools i guess a few schools
are getting sanctioned or something by
the state for having them anyway
but i read the article about chrystal is
his hit piece on desantis but all he had
was sarcasm
he didn't have any reasons
imagine a hit piece
on cnn against a republican
and the best they could do was sarcasm
no reasons so for example
um
desantis said that
florida was in quote coven's season
now what he meant was that when it's hot
people spend more time indoors where you
get more recovered
so desantis was basically saying yeah
you know we expected a spike because
people are getting their air
conditioning they're inside
and chris salisa
uses sarcasm to say
there's no coven season
there's no coven season
no there's no covet season
there's just a season
in which the covet is expected to be
more
for an obvious reason people are indoors
that's it
that was his best hit
on desantis
was something that you completely agree
with and he actually said he agreed with
him
and but before he agreed with him he
treated him sarcastically like well
there's no cove in season overseas
that's it
are you kidding me
that's the best they could come up with
is that desantis did something popular
oh well
in the bad timing news
bad timing news
um
kamala harris had long planned a trip to
vietnam
which is going to coincide with the the
fall of afghanistan
the withdrawal of afghanistan
now
just a coincidence that that was that
that was planned
but
how bad is the timing that we're going
to be made to think about vietnam at the
same time
the biden administration wants you to
think about anything but vietnam
can you see the meeting it's like all
right
guys this is the biden administration
we've got quite the pr problem with the
afghanistan thing but we'll be okay
if people don't make the vietnam
comparison
as long as we keep vietnam out of the
news
i think we can manage this crisis and
spin it
so all right everybody what are you
doing joe biden what are you doing i'll
be hiding and uh i'll make one statement
to say i made no mistakes good good
that's good everybody else will be
saying whatever joe biden says we'll
just good good you're good anybody
anybody else kamala harris what do you
be doing
i'll be traveling to vietnam
nope
bad diving
all right
um do you remember when you became a
military genius
it was this week
i remember not going to school for
military planning and yet
despite my not going to school for
military planning
i
like everybody else in america
this week
military geniuses and let me tell you
let me tell you when i look at this
afghanistan poland i say to myself
you know i have no experience in
logistics
no experience in military anything
but you know what
despite my complete lack of information
and experience
i could have done better
in afghanistan and so could all of you
right
because we're pretty smart
with our complete lack of information
about what was really happening on the
ground
and all of our military genius
now isn't it weird
think about this what are the odds of
this
you think the simulation theory is weird
what about this
seven
plus billion people in the world
how many of them are military geniuses
almost all of them
almost all seven billion are military
geniuses because they all told you what
went wrong in afghanistan but one of the
odds
there was seven billion military
geniuses not one of them
was involved in anything in afghanistan
planning the withdrawal
because it seems like even just one
genius would have made a difference
but none
they had no geniuses
is that why you believe
do you believe that all the geniuses
were
everywhere else except
afghanistan
take a moment
just take a moment and think about that
how stupid are we
really
do you think that the people who are in
charge of the afghanistan withdrawal
with do you think they didn't think of
what you thought of
do you think there's anything that you
thought of
that the planners in afghanistan they
didn't think of it
really
really
they didn't think of it
they didn't they they had not considered
the taliban coming in and
really
but you thought of it but nobody there
thought of it
let me suggest that there's another
explanation of what happened
and i think it's the obvious one
now you don't know right because we're
all speculating so i'm speculating as
much as you are right we're both kind of
guessing here
but i'll tell you what seems most likely
did you hear about uh the
president of afghanistan's departure he
made it kind of quickly and why did he
leave kabul when the
as the taliban were coming in
why did the president of afghanistan
leave kabul well obviously part of it
was he didn't want to be killed
but what was the other part
he didn't want a bloodbath in kabul
because if the president stayed they
would be fighting and it would get
bloody and then what would be the
outcome
kabul would fall anyway
right kabul was going to fall anyway
and what did the intel for the united
states say
about
the taliban taking over when we left
our own intel said that in six months
they were going to take over
so the one thing we knew is that the
taliban were going to take over
was sometime within six months
why do you wait
what was the benefit
exactly
of waiting now you say to yourself well
you'd avoid all that airport stuff
but what would you not avoid what you
what you wouldn't avoid is six months of
civil war
do you think that six months of civil
war
would have created more or less death
than a terribly planned hasty withdrawal
it's not even close the civil war would
have been much worse
the hasty withdrawal
as bad as it was
for everybody
as bad as it was
it was better than not staying
i think biden was 100 right faster is
better you have two choices
fast disaster get it over with
slow disaster
that's it
we had two freaking choices slow
disaster or fast disaster biden chose a
fast disaster
good leadership
i'm sorry i'm never going to change that
opinion
it's good leadership if you have two
choices slow disaster or fast disaster
good leadership picks the fast one
because bad leadership lets you just
string it along and do what you were
doing don't get in trouble
slow disaster oh it wasn't my fault we
did what we could do
too bad the taliban did better than we
thought
pulled that band-aid off biden did it
and he didn't and he didn't apologize
for it and i will always give him credit
for that
now
could we have done a better job of
preparing to get our allies out
probably not
probably not you you as a military
genius believe that if we had done a lot
more to get um to protect the people
that we wanted to protect and we do want
to protect them if we'd done a lot more
to protect them
we'd be in better shape
but what would have happened
if we had uh worked really hard to
protect the people who were escaping
with us
the government would have fallen
like right away
because you would have sent the signal
that you're all doomed
if you start massively deporting the
people who helped us
the government falls right away
and the taliban just walks in
you didn't have a choice of winning
the the moment you think there was a
good way out
you're you're just in crazy land
do you think that there was some good
way out and the experts in logistics and
military strategy
couldn't find it
really
do you know that our military is pretty
well trained right
our military is really really well
trained
somebody thought of the way to do it and
figured out that it wouldn't work
i'm guessing now of course i'm
speculating as much as you are right
could we find out tomorrow that it
really was just massive stupidity yeah
yeah we could but i don't have any
evidence of that
i see no evidence
of failure
and i believe i'm the only one saying
this i don't know if i've heard even one
person say anything close to what i'm
saying
there's no evidence of failure could be
very very very possible i'd even give it
you know maybe more than 50 chance
but we don't see it
it's not an evidence
all right
um
will the taliban support terrorists
setting up camps
i don't know
all the smart people are telling you
that the al-qaeda and the bad guys are
all just going to
reconstitute under the taliban
but does the taliban want that
did the taliban learn nothing
does the taliban want us to come back
i feel like the taliban
might do a little self-policing for
for their own you know interests
don't know yet but i wouldn't rule out
the fact that the taliban doesn't want
al qaeda there
um
of course the big question is is it
trump's fault or somebody else's
rasmussen did a poll on that
found 51 percent think it's biden's
failure the afghanistan and 33 percent
think trump i think that 33 is sort of a
rock bottom for politics
i don't think you can dislodge a third
of the public from their opinions no
matter what
um
but apparently uh trump is being faulted
for believing the taliban might keep
their end of the deal
did he really believe that or did he
just sell it
so we know he sold it
in other words he told people hey you
know i think i got to deal with the
taliban but do you think he believed it
i don't know because i don't think it
mattered
because whether the taliban were going
to keep their end of the deal or not
we were still going to bug out
right one way or the other he got the
taliban to say yeah we'll do some things
and then they didn't do them but i don't
think it mattered
so was that trump's
fault for believing the taliban
i would say it's not in evidence what he
believed it's only an evidence what he
tried to sell
and that might have been a good strategy
just you know just to figure out a way
to get out of there
i also think that there's going to be a
big question mark about what happens
with women
in afghanistan because i don't know that
the i don't know you can put the
toothpaste back in the bottle now they
did it once
the taliban did you know oppress women
once when they were in charge
i just think it's going to be harder
it's going to be harder
and i don't know what that does because
the remember the taliban is acting
weirdly
non-taliban-y in some ways right they
said they would respect women's rights
within the
within the boundaries of
islam who knows what that is
um
so you know i think the odds are it's a
it's a disaster for women
but i'm not so sure
i think there's at least some chance
that the taliban is going to change i
mean remember it's been 20 years
you know
you know even the taliban might morph a
little bit in 20 years
don't know
all right so those were the things that
i wanted to talk about today but i'm
going to throw this in
there's a new study by yale
school of management
they studied which
which mitigation strategies for the
pandemic worked and they studied masks
and mask effectiveness if you haven't
seen it yet
what do you think they found
yale school of management so let's let's
assume that they know how to do
statistics right it's yale
so let's assume it's smart people who
did it
what do they think that they determined
about mass effectiveness
go without seeing it what do you think
ohm
uh
pandemic mitigation did it help in the
pandemic masks
12 percent
they say 12 of deaths were avoided
now twelve percent of deaths let's see
we had over six hundred thousand deaths
so let's say maybe sixty five thousand
deaths were avoided
was that worth wearing masks
in the comments if it was true now of
course we you know you have to be
skeptical of any kind of science and
those who criticize me for not being
skeptical of things that agree with me
this would be one of those cases
so yes be skeptical of this
even though it agrees with me
so that's about what we expected mass to
be 15 12
you know somewhere in that range
um
so if this is true
and that that's a big f
if it's true i would say that masks were
a smart idea
that have now reached the end of the the
trade-off where it's worth doing
in my opinion
saving 12 percent of a thousand deaths a
day
maybe not worth it for the for the lack
of freedom that it gives you and the
lifestyle change it gives you etc
so um i throw that out there for anomaly
my mascot who doesn't believe that that
study will be valid and maybe it isn't
like every other study so don't assume
that's the final word but maybe someday
we'll find out and by the way this study
did find that
closing down non-critical places didn't
matter
all right bye for now
gotta run
