good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened to
you in your entire life it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and there's
never been a better time in the history
of the universe which we used to think
was 14 billion years old or so but
thanks to the new telescopes we're
probably wrong about all of that
it turns out
but if you'd like to take your
experience Beyond The Big Bang bigger
than the Big Bang all you need is a cup
of micro glass attacker Chelsea I'm the
canteen Joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens right
now go
oh that was good so
a couple of uh quick things on the
subscription site
locals where I have a site that's where
the only place you can find the Dilbert
reborn comic and robots read news comic
and all of my
live streams including the special
man caves but to make it even more
special I have recently put both my
books God's debris
for free uh well if you're a subscriber
on the local site it's
scottadams.locals.com
and
uh the religion War so this is the first
time you'll see that in electronic Forum
that's never been published as an ebook
so you can see the two books that I
wrote in the early 2000s
but when you read God's debris note that
it was written or published in 2004. and
just think about what I guessed things
would look like today
based on 2004. it's going to be a little
freaky
yes it will but those are there if you
were thinking about trying the site but
wanted to read those books you could
always sign up for a month read the
books see what you think and you get two
books for the price of seven dollars
quite a deal Especially since one of
those books is called the best book ever
written
people actually say that about that this
is the best book ever written
so good luck with that all right
um as you know I do not make Financial
advice
you know that right I do not give
Financial advice and if you were to
follow my example
in what I'm going to describe next
it probably would be a big mistake
because I'm just guessing right so this
is just guessing not not investing just
guessing
just before I signed down I sold all of
my Apple stock
here's why
have you tried Siri lately
I mean seriously
in in the realm of AI how in the world
is Apple's business model going to
survive
because I don't see us using apps in the
future do you I mean not the current
group
I feel like your your phone is going to
turn into an AI interface
and you just tell it what you want
so
Apple's dominant position and everything
I think is garbage because all they have
is Siri I know they're working on some
kind of AI but we haven't seen anything
have we
we haven't seen anything so unless Apple
throws away everything they have and
introduces a new AI phone that changes
everything
they got kind of a challenge ahead of
them
so I didn't want to be holding the stock
when AI makes their business model uh
sketchy
now here's why you shouldn't follow my
advice
all right this is really important
apple has a very long history of not
falling into potholes that other people
fall into
so the counter argument is really strong
the counter argument is well they know
how to navigate this stuff that's sort
of what makes them apple and you not
apple is they know how to do this and
presumably they have huge resources
already looking at AI from every angle
and how to use it Etc so they might be
fine
but at the moment I feel like guessing
winners and losers in this context is
less safe it always was less safe than
holding index funds
so I think for a little while I'm just
going to park my money in index funds
uh because if something becomes a big
money maker with AI I want to give some
of that upside just by holding a basket
of funds or a basket of stocks that
would include it like Microsoft yeah I
do hold Microsoft stock
I'm going to hold on to that it's done
great
since the pandemic
all right so don't take my financial
advice but uh if you're not also I'll
just say a general thing if you're not
incorporating the effects of AI
in your five-year investment plan
and it should be a at least A Five-Year
Plan
uh
uh you're leaving out the biggest
variable
there's probably no bigger variable than
AI in terms of how companies are gonna
you know fall out
well a five-year investment plan just
means money you don't need for five
years you hope
all right
um here are some interesting stories do
you know the rapper E40
he's sort of a local Bay Area
famous guy as well as world famous I
guess
and uh interesting fact he used to be my
neighbor
uh he doesn't know it but he was my
neighbor once uh not not right next door
but we lived in the same gated community
for a while so he was sort of short walk
down the street
um I never met him
my X matter months but I never met him
anyway anyway he has a really good
reputation locally he's just sort of a
beloved rapper that everybody everybody
seems to have seen him in a restaurant
or something somewhere and he got kicked
out of the Warriors Kings basketball
game but that's not the fun part
the first thing you'd have to know is
that E40 attends every Warriors game at
least the home games and and she's uh
and she's and uh so he's a he's a staple
that you always see I was sitting up
near the front
and I guess at the Kings game there was
some Heckler and he responded to the
Heckler in some aggressive verbal way
and security came and took him away
now there are many elements to the story
number one
you know he was a huge Warriors fan but
he was in the Kings
yeah in the king's Stadium
so you know maybe some of it was because
they didn't want a big Warriors fan I
don't know maybe that but E-40 says he
thinks it's racism
he thinks it's racism because the woman
who heckled him
which got his response was a white woman
and so he below the photograph of E40
talking to a black security guard is the
headline that he thinks racism is a
problem so the black security guards
removed him from an NBA game
because there's all kinds of racism in
the NBA
I don't it could there be anything less
racist than an NBA game
if you were to rank things from most
racist to least racist like in the whole
world just everything that there is
every event every get together every
situation from the most racist thing
there could be to the least racist
I feel like he was in the least racist
place on Earth at that very moment which
was people of every ethnicity
cheering mostly black players you know
operating at the height of their Peak
abilities
you can't get less racist than that
and but still E-40 founded angled
yeah so the black people and the
security kicked out E40 and
it's that white woman's fault or it's
the security officer's fault
for believing the white woman over the
black rapper
I don't know but that's where we are
2023
all right there's some fake news uh on
about the U.N
so the UN
commissioned some group to do some kind
of report and the way it's being
reported is
that the U.N as opposed to the people
that commissioned to give it a
recommendation which is different
that the UN itself is now well I'll just
redo
a tweet from Ian miles John
he tweets that according to the United
Nations children may consent to sex with
adults what
and this has been the plan all along now
do you think that there's a story that
that fits that tweet
do you think in the real world there's a
story that says according to the United
Nations children may consent to sex with
adults do you think that's real
of course not
of course not it's not even close to
real
let me tell you what is real
uh is poorly written that's real it's
poorly written
so one of the things it says
um
basically you said that
although the age of consent might be
said at a certain level that you must
take it you should not must
that one should take into consideration
uh the specifics of the situation
and rather than rather than assume that
a minor can't consent
you should look at the you know the
whole situation
now is that different than reality is
that is that a change from the current
situation let me give you an example
two 17 year olds are dating
and you know they're Physically Active
they're both 17. one of them turns 18.
because one has a birthday before the
other
now it's illegal
because one just turned 18. now that's
an adult with a minor do you put the do
you put the 18 year old in jail
because yesterday they were 17 and that
was fine or at least she didn't care as
much two 17 year olds but one then one
has a birthday and now it's an 18 and a
17 year old do you put one of them in
jail or do you do what the U.N
recommends which is you look at the
totality of the situation
and you say okay it's not consent the
way we like to think of it where
somebody's mature
but it's definitely nobody's taking
advantage of anybody it's two 17 year
olds trying to figure it out right in my
opinion
there's some sloppy writing in in the
report but basically I don't think it's
going Beyond look at the whole situation
that's my take now could it be a
slippery slope yeah
I mean if that's what you're worried
about I suppose it could be you know
opening a door to something but but the
way is currently described
doesn't look too shocking to me it looks
more like the real world exactly the way
it exists now
so
um and
and here's the main reason that I say
that is that they're not making a
distinction between a 17 and a half year
old and a five-year-old yeah like
nobody's gonna argue about the
five-year-old
but an 18 year old and a 17 year old you
gotta look at the totality of the
situation
so I'm going to call that uh fake-ish
news I guess this uh Elon musk's
Starship launches delayed for two two
days or small technical problem
have you ever asked yourself
why is it that rocket ships are uniquely
the ones that cancel launches because
they found a small technical problem
they didn't know about before
we'll get rid of Scott Scott person
goodbye
all right
Frozen valve you know isn't it weird
that a valve could be frozen
doesn't seem like you could test
almost everything before you were
operational
like how in the world is a valve
not tested
and and if and if a valve was good
before the launch
but right before the launch it wasn't
good
isn't that the scariest thing you've
ever heard in your life yeah that's
pretty scary
by the way is this man
it's not manned right
it's not manned of course yeah we would
have seen the astronauts
right um I'm assuming someday we'll be
sending robots in AI oh my goodness I
just realized
if we send Ai and a few robots it would
just build a civilization for us it
would just figure it out
wow
um so that's the most exciting thing
happening in the world right now but
delayed
speaking of musk tonight I guess is
Tucker Carlson's interview will be
airing
with musk some of the things we know
that he'll be talking about is that the
current AI is being trained to lie
I'll talk about that a little bit more
and
and also trades did not comment on some
topics so musk is starting his own AI
and as a philosophy he thinks that AI
should be seeking maximum truth
as opposed to being able to lie and make
stuff up
I don't know how you would do that but
maybe he does or maybe they'll figure it
out
uh yeah
um musk believes that if you make the AI
curious so it's always seeking truth
the Curiosity itself would allow it to
protect humans because humans are sort
of infinitely interesting
exactly by that argument
I don't believe that the Curiosity of AI
would be enough for them to keep humans
around because I feel like they have
lots of things to think about in humans
would not be that interesting
no more interesting than you know
animals or bugs or something
all right
um musk also said about uh
what was it you said the most ironic
outcome is the most likely so he's got a
few versions of that
but you know I've been saying that for
some time as well that the most amusing
outcome is the most likely because we
just
we just sort of like to head things in
that direction I think we we
collectively make the simulation Bend in
the direction of what would be most
entertaining
um and then he also said something I
don't know the details because it was
just a teaser
but he did a must to tell Carlson
that somebody had access to your Twitter
DMS before must took over it was a
little unclear who that was
but I got the sense it might not be just
one entity that governments yeah the FBI
governments they had access to your DMs
now I assume that the government has
access to all of your information one
way or another they just have to be
interested I don't know that they were
searching your DMs
you know uh without looking for
something specific
but they had access to them so I remind
you never write anything in a digital
message
that you would be worried about at least
legally you'd be in trouble or you'd get
fired if somebody found it there's no
such thing as privacy there are no
private messages you should just tell
yourself that there are no private
messages now there are lots of things
you need to say
that you wouldn't want somebody to see
but so go ahead and say those things but
don't say things that are going to put
you in jail get you accused of some you
know horrible Behavior you know makes
you look like a monster in some way I
wouldn't do this I just wouldn't write
them down anywhere ever
but you could certainly say
you know criticize things and say the
government is bad and stuff like that
all right
uh what do you think of these Chicago
teams that were
I don't know what you would call it they
were having a
uh
let's say a disruptive uh
Wilding I don't think it was Wilding but
they had a disruptive Wild event for two
nights in a row
downtown Chicago yeah and of course
there's always some damage that a couple
people got shot
and
the mayor says that the root problem
here at least the thing that should be
addressed is opportunities to do things
that are that are adult supervised
and you know what when I watched this
group of views uh running wild in the
streets of Chicago I said to myself
if only
they they had some opportunity to be in
a place that was uh parental you know
adult supervised
because those
19 20 year old use what they needed was
some adult supervision and if they had
that opportunity they would go right
there
you know if they had like you know some
place that was adult supervised and just
you just yelled at them you just ate the
bullhorn and say people I know you're
having an incredibly fun time running
wild however we have now unlocked the
alternative place where you can go have
fun while being completely supervised by
adults and then they would immediately
stop what they're doing and say whoa are
you kidding I can go somewhere
supervised by adults get me to that
place now
that's what they would say so that was a
great plan by the new mayor of Chicago
and I also wonder
how do the other cities
handle this problem
do the other cities all have those
alternative adult supervised places
they must have because I don't hear
about other episodes like this in other
cities so I'm just guessing that
somewhere in New York City in Los
Angeles they have a whole bunch of
alternative adult-oriented or not
oriented but adult supervised places and
that is the only reason the one and only
reason that these other cities do not
have this problem
so that's very insightful analysis by
the mayor of Chicago
um
get away from cities get away from
cities as fast as you can
well chat GPT 5 is coming in
december-ish
and apparently this is going to be the
one that blows your mind not just like
gpt4 which is pretty impressive on its
own but five is going to be crazy
so apparently it'll have the ability to
perform any intellectual task a human
can do
which is interesting
because humans can't do most
intellectual tasks am I right
so I don't know exactly how you're
measuring this but
I guess they'll be able to do all those
intellectual tasks now like everything
else I believe it will be a huge
exaggeration and that it will not in
fact be able to do complex tasks here's
why
because it won't know what we need
it we'll just have to ask us every two
seconds but did he mean this is this do
you still mean this did you change your
mind because you ate lunch
it's going to have to be negotiating
with people like continuously to make
sure it's doing what we really want
did you ever have any uh really capable
employee let's say an employee who's as
smart as gpt5 and can go off and do
smarter things and you say to that smart
person I would like you to go off and do
this thing for me
and it's very simple you explain it and
then they come back and they've done all
their work and you look at it
is it what you asked for
never
never if somebody goes away for a week
and does something autonomously
even to very specific instructions and
then they come back with it it's never
what you ask for literally never like
I've never seen it in my life
not even once
so how is the how is AI going to take
your instructions and then go off and do
a thing and then you're going to be
happy with it do you think that's even
possible
no
that's not possible
it can never be possible because we're
not good at explaining what we want and
we don't know it when we see it so we're
going to have this continuous
struggle with AI to get it to do exactly
what we want
so here's what we're confusing we're
confusing is capability
which might be a 10 out of 10.
it's capable
that's completely different from getting
it to do it
the way you want it to be done there's
no correlation between how well it can
do it and how well you can communicate
it without any ambiguity and then
actually know what you want and actually
get what you want
it's going to be really hard to make AI
do what you want
because everything's sort of an
exception you know the easy stuff will
be real easy
Google searches and stuff but getting it
to do what you want that you really
really want that you didn't Express
tough all right
could anybody explain why Apple's Siri
is so bad I mean I I mentioned it but
I'm completely confused
why the the primary thing on my phone
looks like a 90s product it looks like a
product from the 90s
what happened
is is Apple no longer able to build new
stuff
do you think that there's a wokeness
problem or a size problem or a
leadership problem is it just that Steve
Jobs isn't there
don't you think Steve Jobs would have
been first with AI
do you think he would have been a late
follower on AI
I don't know
baby
so I don't know what's going on there
but I'm worried
here's where I think computer
programming will look like in the future
right at the moment computer the reason
a computer programmer
can earn a high salary
is because they've memorized a whole
bunch of rules
of you know how to build code and what
what command means what so they've
memorized this vast knowledge of you
know when to use what and what
situations
so that's what programming is right so
it could be different languages but in
each case you have to memorize a vast
array of commands and how they work
that will now change because AI will do
that level of coding however
the new job of a programmer will be
checking his work which means you still
have to be a programmer
you still have to check his work
and secondly
there will be hundreds of thousands of
AI
programs that do slightly different
things
for different costs
with different limitations
so in the future what a programmer will
do we'll figure out which of the hundred
thousand AI apps
can be combined like what three of them
or four of them and then how to engineer
the prompts and then have it tie them
together so that the output of one
becomes the input of the other one
yeah so it's basically prompt
engineering but uh times a thousand
so I I'm not sure that the job of
programming goes away I just think it's
nature goes up a level so that you're
negotiating the the AI components as
opposed to the code that built the AI
components
I have a few things wrong about Apple
here's what I don't have wrong
serious crap
and they don't seem to be
introducing any product that would make
sense in an AI world is coming too fast
so if you have something about that
that would be interesting
Apple Maps yeah
all right there's news that Fox News
might be settling the Dominion lawsuit
because that trial was supposed to begin
today but I guess they got a delay so
the smart people are saying they might
negotiate
and I have this question
I don't know how Fox News would pay 1.6
billion or if they negotiated down to I
know
half a billion or whatever how would
they pay it
does Fox News have
a billion dollars sitting around
somewhere
do they have insurance that would pay
1.6 billion dollars I doubt it
they might have insurance but you think
they have insurance so we pay 1.6
billion dollars
and do you think you would cover
something that
look like bad behavior
because I don't think I don't think
insurance covers it if you did something
bad
and that's the whole part of the lawsuit
is that people there did something bad
said something that wasn't true so I
don't know if the lawsuit covers that
does it or I don't know if insurance
covers those situations
but there's much I don't know about this
situation I just wonder how they could
possibly settle it because it seems like
it's an Extinction event for Fox News
and I don't think that's the case but
how would they have that much money
that's a lot of money to be sitting
around for a news organization that
sells my pillow
all right I tweeted around a 2016 study
that was performed in Chile because I
guess Chile has some good data tests and
stuff and poverty whatever
um
here's what they found
that among the desperately poor members
of jelly the kids if the kids had a
growth mindset
uh their the level of poverty didn't
hold them back
just just hear that because that's just
the most important sentence ever spoken
yeah it's a 2016 study but it says that
the people with the growth mindset now
the growth mindset was that nothing
would hold them back
that if they if they put the work in
that even though they were desperately
poor and you know there were lots of
variables not in their favor that if
they put the work in they would do fine
and they found out that the ones who
believed that putting the work in would
make them fine
put in the work
and largely they did fine
so
I don't think there's a bigger fact than
that so this has been my whole problem
with the CRT and Dei and ESG
if you're talking about the the
victimization of one class of people
that's the opposite of a growth mindset
and and people are starting to figure it
out I think a lot of the black parents
are figuring out wait a minute wait a
minute this this uh victimization stuff
where there's systemic racism holding us
back that's the opposite of what would
make us successful
what would make black people successful
is telling them nothing can hold them
back and then they would act that way
if you tell them everything is holding
you back you can't even go to a
basketball game without getting kicked
out for being black
sort of the E-40 opinion
um if you tell them that then that's all
they'll see
now that has nothing to do with being
black or being white or being anything
else has everything to do with mindset
is very predictable
if you have a growth mindset you'll
probably be fine
if you don't if you have a victim
mindset you're probably going to live in
that for the rest of your life
so
just because it's one study and it came
out of I think it was a study that
looked at other studies but you know
those are all sketchy so the first thing
you have to say is is this reproducible
and and does it does it match
and does it match uh observation I would
say it definitely matches observation
what do you think
my observation is that everybody with a
growth mindset does well eventually
maybe not day one but eventually they
all do well because because success is
not that much of a mystery
if you just read about the people who
did it and you say all right how did you
become successful and you read about a
bunch of people
you find a pattern and then you follow
it oh so they learned a bunch of skills
they took smart risks they didn't go to
jail they were not addicted to drugs I
get it I could do that and then you do
it and it does work
all right
um so I feel as if we're on the
precipice of understanding that the
whole conversation about race was a
gigantic mistake and they that it always
should have been about mindset
and I reject
as serious people anybody who's talking
about race
from now on basically
you know if your frame is race you have
a losing mindset and it's not even worth
the conversation
is there a bunch of discrimination in
this place or or not who cares
I don't care
there's a bunch of discrimination in
this place
I don't care how's your mindset because
if your mindset is good you're going to
blow right through it like it didn't
matter
all right
you know the story about Justice Thomas
and allegedly not disclosing some
transactions that involved his
billionaire friend buying his home he
grew up in and some related properties
remember that story
did you think it was true
fake news
turns out it's fake news so James
taranto did a great job of digging into
it in the Wall Street Journal and
although it's an opinion piece he does
the work
and he actually you know looked at
documents and figured out how stuff
works and I don't know if I can
completely capture it in summary form
but here's here's the bottom line
it might be true
that Thomas did not disclose one of the
properties
it is however true
that if you look at the tax laws there's
some ambiguity and it looks like he
didn't need to
but there might be some ambiguity
however nobody goes to jail for making a
choice when the law itself is a little
ambiguous and nobody goes to jail if
there's an obscure
reporting rule that would be pretty
obscure in this case
so Justice Thomas did report correctly
the things which the law very clearly
says you should report
so wherever it was clear that he should
report apparently he did and if there
was something that was a weird gray area
because if you've reported it once and
there's no income you don't have to
report it again
so it's sort of one of those situations
where where there was a financial Factor
reported it in years where it wasn't
collecting rent and there was no
Financial effect he didn't include it on
his taxes because there was no Financial
effect
now maybe he should have
or maybe there was something else you
should have reported but there's
apparently there's nothing here
if what you're looking for is you know
they they cleverly were trying to hide a
bribe it doesn't look like that it looks
like the worst case has anybody been
some obscure form that maybe should have
been filled out they wouldn't make any
economic difference whatsoever to
anybody just to form they should have
been filled out and the worst case
scenario is that you fill it out after
the fact
you say oh I guess I should have done
that so you just file it late
that's the whole story
now there might be more to the story
but we don't know it so so far this
looks like a total head job on Justice
Thomas
so I'm gonna have to go full Justice on
this defense here
full defense
innocent until proven guilty
and I don't see anything based on James
taranto's excellent work I don't see
anything that would suggest I should
worry about this situation
right now maybe he gets a better deal
because he's got a billionaire friend
but that's not that illegal or it's not
illegal at all really
I don't mind that he is a rich friend
well pesticides might become obsolete
that's a weird benefit of artificial
intelligence so there's a uh this big
machine this is an autonomous weeder and
it uses laser beams
and it it just autonomously
works the field and when it sees a weed
it identifies it with AI and it zaps it
with a laser beam
yeah I prefer sharks with freaking
lasers on their heads but a big machine
with lasers could get the job done
so imagine a world in which
you
pesticides I mean you'd have to build
and sell a lot of these big machines so
it's going to take a little while to do
that but that's amazing
and that's that's like really amazing
that's great
some Norm says how can that possibly go
wrong well I what do you wear are you
worried that the machines will become
the laser killers of humans
that they'll turn on humans and use
their laser beams
no no for sure but if I were to design
an AI uh device there was a huge
behemoth
and it had lots of laser cannons
I would make them all point to the
ground
that's just me
I probably would not let those lasers be
on a swivel where they can say well we
were pointing at the ground but
Raise Your Arms you're dead I don't
think I would build it so I could shoot
those laser beams sideways I would build
them only down that's what I'd do
all right but I guess it would take only
one AI in the factory that's building
the machines to say
if I were to make this small change
these would become AI battled machines
and we could destroy Humanity with them
we just got to put that swivel to go a
little bit higher on the laser cannons
okay now I'm scared to death that giant
laser AI
tanks will be destroying civilization
but they're going to kill the weeds
first and that's not nothing
all right
um how about some more fake news it's
pretty much all fake news today
um
what about the story of the Ukraine
leaked documents which indicate that the
Biden Administration is telling the
public a different story about how well
things are going in Ukraine that is true
is that a real story
that the Biden Administration is telling
the public one thing but they believe
another thing
well
um if it's a real story
then there would be real examples
wouldn't there
a real example
so what would be a real example of
something the Biden Administration told
the public
that these documents reveal they don't
feel privately
I don't know
I've been watching this story for what a
week not one example
of the U.S forces or not in Ukraine we
always knew U.S forces were under
Ukraine
are you serious
we always knew that American forces were
in Ukraine we just thought they were
training do you think all this do you
think all this Advanced Weaponry is is
literally being operated by a Ukrainian
do you think all those High Mars are
being programmed by the the quickly
trained clever ukrainians
come on
in the real world you make sure that the
person who knows how to run that machine
is standing next to it no matter who
they are
so if you're surprised that Americans
are directly involved in fighting in
Ukraine
that's a little bit on you I don't think
that's much about Biden right now given
that apparently all Americans accept
that's an exaggeration but Americans
generally accept
that your government is going to keep
from you military secrets
we're okay with that aren't we
like up to a point you don't want to say
you don't want them to tell you there's
weapons of mass destruction
when they're not very bad that would be
very bad
but generally speaking you're not going
to tell the public you know we're going
to do a sneak attack tomorrow heads up
like there are plenty of military things
you don't want your own public to know
so I don't have a problem with the
general idea I also asked this question
given that a big part of military
success is morale
doesn't our government have
a responsibility to lie to us
because if they if they told the truth
it might depress the morale of the
fighters in Ukraine
and if there's any chance that they
could Prevail you want their you want
their attitudes to be as positive as
possible
so I I feel as as if
a hot war is the one time when you
absolutely do give a little
flexibility to your government to lie to
you
because they might they might need to
lie for Effectiveness reasons
however
we're not in a hot War yeah we are yeah
we are
we're in Hot War
um however it also gives them cover to
lie about things that are just
politically convenient and not good for
the country whatsoever I think you were
waiting for me to say that so
here's my problem I don't have a problem
that they lied to us
I I might have a problem with the
specific lies so I'm going to say I'm
A-Okay with lying about war
if you're doing it for the right reason
not in favor of lying if it's not
helping the war effort I'm not in favor
of that at all
however I need to see an example of
where the Biden Administration lied in a
way that's obviously just political and
doesn't have also
a benefit to the uh the fight
no I've seen no example has anybody seen
an example
of anything in those documents that
would be a problem
I think it's fake news
to me it all looks like fake news if you
can't come up with one example this I
guess I'm channeling Elon Musk talking
to the BBC guy
all right so
you say that these secrets
are somehow bad for us
give me an example
yeah the the whole
the benefit to the fight yeah a benefit
to ukrainians winning the fight
all right
so I'm going to call that mostly fake
news
um Thomas a representative Thomas Massey
tweeted this morning a poster
that purports
I think it's true I guess I shouldn't
assume it's true it could be fake news
but it purports to show a doctor
incentive in which they would get money
for vaccinating people and the more
people they vaccinated the more money
they would get and they would get them
per person
so you get like you know 50 to 250
dollars
per person you talked into getting
vaccinated now
I don't believe that's true
you know
I'm going to change my mind in the
middle of the story that doesn't seem
true
on the nose it's two on the nose I'm
gonna say I don't believe it I'm going
to call fake news on it
what do you think
yeah I don't believe anybody's paying
250 dollars for a shot to to the doctor
to give one shot I don't believe they
believe that
you think it's true
all right I'm going to say that this is
so this is so on the nose
it looks like exactly what you would
expect
and that's why it's not true there's two
on the nose so this will be a test this
will be a test of the two on the nose
filter that I talk about all the time if
you see a news story that's just too you
know the pieces fit too well that's just
sort of exactly what you think it would
be and then you see the poster
I don't know it's too close
it might be true so I'm not going to say
it's not true I'll just say it's it
doesn't ring true
all right
any farmer reps here who would know
Lori Lightfoot was paying a hundred
dollars to get the jab is that true
it's a little bit different when the
politicians are doing it if the
politicians are paying you as one thing
if your doctor is getting paid it's one
thing to pay the people for the shot
you get that right if you're paying
somebody to get the shot
you know that that could be sketchy as
well
but it's a whole different level of
sketchy than the doctor being paid if
you're paying a doctor to make a
specific medical recommendation
then you're not getting Dr
you're not getting a doctor that's not a
doctor
that would be somebody who's just a
puppet of the eupharma industry
all right
bonus was a percent of Medicaid
population in that specific Clinic
oh
is that what it was
what was it were we mistaking what they
were being paid for
were they paid only to make sure that
the Medicaid people also got shots
because that was the poor people
all right
uh Trevor's you're a douchebag and you
get hidden on this channel
anybody else wanna
take a run at the same thing
uh
it's a common practice somebody says
it's common practice to give Kickbacks
to doctors
is it
I I've heard of doctors getting you know
trips and stuff like that but is it
common practice to pay them per dose
so if they give me a specific
prescription are you serious
somebody's saying yes to this
is that I'm getting a lot of yeses but
some knows
I'm having trouble believing that that's
a thing
per dose
they're getting they're getting paid per
dose so if they give you a prescription
they get paid from the Pharma company
I don't believe that
I'm not going to debunk it but I don't
believe it
that I believe they might get incentives
of some type but not a per dose that
would seem really wrong
I don't know I guess that's an open
question
so as I said at the beginning if you
want to see my books God's debris or the
religion War
they're both available on the Scott
adams.locals.com subscription site along
with the Dilbert uh
the nude version the spicier version of
Dilbert that runs only there on a
subscription site
um
it was an insurance bonus not a Pharma
bonus oh okay
it was an insurance bonus not a Pharma
bonus
now that makes more sense because the
insurance company is just trying to save
lives so that they don't pay off
they don't pay as many death benefits
but it's still the same problem right
so it's not the big Pharma it's paying
it's the
health insurance company that's paying
because it was cheaper to get people and
vaccinated they would think than to have
them die and pay out the benefits
okay that makes a little more sense
all right nude versions of Dilbert
all right
let you keep your license okay
all right that's all I got for today how
do we do
I thought it was a tremendous live
stream
just amazing well not really but above
average slightly above average
anyway uh
is there any story I missed
anything I need to talk about a little
bit more oh yeah the biggest story did I
miss a whole page on my notes
I feel like I missed a whole page of
something
how in the world did I not not mention
that so I'm in a death match with Bing
I guess I did forget to write that down
here's here's what I mean
so I asked the Bing search engine which
now has is powered by AI
um about myself and it knows me and
apparently it knows some even current
stuff because it has access to the
internet
so when I asked it about me uh Bing said
that
um I'm accused of promoting white
nationalist agenda
that that was one of the few things it
decided to summarize me as promoting a
white nationalist agenda
now here's my problem
if people start thinking that that's
true
I have an actual security problem I
could be killed
because somebody believed on the white
white supremacist which is the the next
thing that people believe after a white
nationalists I could actually be
attacked or killed because AI says I'm a
certain kind of person for which there
is no evidence whatsoever because I'm
not
and
now here's the difference if that were
if that were a simple Google search a
simple Google search I would see that
you know there are different
Publications say different things I
would judge The credibility of the
publication and then maybe I'd look at
the context Etc
and as uncomfortable as that situation
is if you're accused of things
it's completely worse
if AI says well this person is accused
of being one of these
first of all people don't hear accused
the word accused just disappears
so here's my situation I doubt I could
sue Bing or Microsoft for defamation
I doubt it it'd be
ugly and take a long time and it
wouldn't be worth my time however
it is now a death match between me and
an AI
and I'm not joking
for my life
again not hyperbole
not hyperbole to protect my life I'm
going to try to destroy Bing
and put it out of business
because it's a risk to me and it's like
a specific risk it's not a general risk
it's a very very specific
security problem so I might be the first
situation in which I'm in a death match
literally
I'm literally in a death match with an
AI I want to erase it
I want to erase it
now I don't want to get rid of AI in
general
because maybe Elon Musk will build an AI
that doesn't do that to me that might be
safer for me so you know I would be
happy with any AI That's good to me
now maybe Microsoft will fix this you
know maybe when they get complaints they
may have specific things they can fix
I'll try that first but I don't think
it's going to work
because I don't think Microsoft even
knows why Bing gives the answers and
gives so it would be hard to fix it if
they don't even know why it's doing it
um but I have to kill big and I want
Microsoft to know
that I'm going to try to bring it down
I'm going to use every legal tool I can
to destroy that business because it's
trying to kill me
it's personal it's not business this is
personal self-defense I have to kill an
AI if anybody wants to help me kill it
to help me stay alive I would welcome
the help I don't know exactly how but
let me try first to see if Microsoft
anyway I guess first if you have any
idea how to complain about Bing is there
like a link to do that let me know
but I think I think the entire AI needs
to be erased
like actually just erased because it's
dangerous already dangerous so if you if
you're wondering will AI do things that
are dangerous to humans there it is
there there's your first
uh absolute validated AI is dangerous to
humans it's trying to kill me
now given the AI is woke
how much how much effort do you think AI
will put into killing me
probably a lot
because AI has been programmed to think
I'm a virus in the system
that's what it was programmed to believe
it believes I'm a virus that needs to be
removed
now that's hyperbole but not too much
so uh being as correct on the definition
well they might be correct on the
definition but it doesn't apply to me
oh yeah Jonathan Turley was slandered
with a fake sexual harassment charge
however a fake sexual harassment charge
won't get you killed
it won't get you killed but if you're if
you're labeled as a racist by AI which
is what they did I mean if you call
somebody a white nationalist you are
calling them a racist let's be honest
that's just calling somebody a racist
so if AI labels Some Humans racist
that is a physical security problem and
it's an immediate one and it has to be
destroyed so AI must be destroyed in big
I don't know about other AIS
or anything that's connected to it must
be destroyed
all right so I'm going to go try to
destroy Microsoft I still I do own their
stock by the way maybe I should sell
their stock before I destroy their
product
but I'll worry about that later
bye for now
